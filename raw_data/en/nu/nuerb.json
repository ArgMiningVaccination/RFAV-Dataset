Typically Offered: Offered by Announcement Only. EPH 611. Mindfulness in Public Health and Medicine. 3 Credit Hours. The stress of modern life can adversely impact physical and mental health functioning which may be ameliorated by the practice of mindfulness. Mindfulness is a mental state achieved by focusing one's awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one's feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations. This practice is derived from Buddhist traditions more than 2,500 years old. In recent decades these practices have been adopted for use in United States and elsewhere and evidence is growing that these practices can reduce psychological symptomatology (e.g., symptoms of depression and anxiety), enhance resiliency in response to stressors, enhanced pain coping ability, and enhanced attentional regulation, among other benefits. The first half of this course will be devoted to the completion of an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Course (MBSR) that will involve in-class activities and daily at-home mindfulness practice assignments. Students will maintain a journal documenting their \"first-person\" encounter with the practice of mindfulness. The second half of the course will be organized around a lecture format with weekly brief quizzes. Anonymous questionnaire data will be collected before, during and after completion of the MBSR course. These data will be used by student teams to evaluate the impact of MBSR on multiple outcomes. Groups will prepare a written report and present their findings to the class at the end of the semester. Components: LEC. Grading: GRD. Typically Offered: Offered by Announcement Only. EPH 612.

Health systems around the world must respond to an evolving landscape of health risk and disease burden that is increasingly dominated by complex, chronic illness. Contrary to what is often espoused, chronic and non-communicable diseases affect both poor and rich. Yet, access to health services is highly inequitable creating immense divides and equity imperatives that have largely been ignored in global health. This course examines how global and national health systems - particularly in low and middle-incomes countries - can better face the changing burden of disease with a focus on equity and universal coverage. Requisite: Must be in either Offered: Fall & Spring. EPH 614. Global Outbreak. 3 Credit Hours.

Components: LEC. Grading: GRD. Typically Offered: Summer. EPH 616. Global Health and Global Justice. 3 Credit Hours. Global health has emerged as a field distinct from older visions of international health, by focusing on macro-level problems caused by globalization whose origin and solution must transcend national boundaries. Yet global health has also challenged ethics to develop new accounts of justice in this changing world. This course will analyze global health from the lens of ethics. The course will introduce core theories of public health ethics (e.g. utilitarianism, statism and cosmopolitanism) to make sense of the rise of global justice as a distinct field of ethical inquiry. Armed with this conceptual foundation, we will then examine some of the central problems of global health, as well as proposed solutions to those problems. Such skills in argumentation will be increasingly critical for future public health leaders, yet too few public health students are exposed to ethical analysis. By applying ethical frameworks to analyze global health problems, students will gain critical skills in how to integrate distinct forms of knowledge, how to develop cogent normative arguments, and how to articulate and defend an account of fair decision-making and just policies in global health.

Hospital Health Care Services and Access: An Interdisciplinary Inquiry. 3 Credit Hours. Hospitals play a vital role in the health of the communities they serve. Yet, their accessibility and availability to those communities is often unequal, and significant racial and ethnic disparities exist in the utilization of hospital services, quality of care provided, health outcomes and patient experiences. Attention has been increasingly focused on creating sustainable solutions to attenuating these disparities. Initial steps include the examination of community and hospital data to identify inequalities in disease distribution, as well as utilization of care. Such data provides evidence to define critical areas of concern and provides a starting point for engagement with the community. The real work begins when hospitals work with community partners to engage in authentic and collaborative partnerships to address the needs and the health of the local citizens. This process, known as Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR), can harness resources and build capacity to address health issues relevant to the community. This course will discuss the change that hospitals can achieve when they facilitate community-academic partnerships that bring together knowledge, expertise and interest of community partners with the research and training of clinicians and academic researchers.
