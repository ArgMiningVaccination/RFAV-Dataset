Department of Health (Department) amended its regulations to school immunizations, 28 Pa. Code Chapter 23, Subchapter C. These regulations are effective Aug. 1, 2017 and will impact the entering class(es) for school year 2017-2018. The amendments revise \u00a7 23.82 (definitions), \u00a7 23.83 (immunization requirements), \u00a7 23.85 (responsibilities of schools and school administrators) and \u00a7 23.86 (school reporting). These amendments added definitions of the terms \"full immunization\" and \"medical certificate.\" Amendments also reflect the fact that several vaccines required for school attendance are no longer available in the United Stated in certain forms. For example, two pediatric acellular vaccines are available in the United States; however, the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine is not available. Therefore, the separate antigen forms were deleted, and the combination form was added. The regulations allow for a child with a contraindication for the pertussis component of the vaccine to obtain a combination diphtheria and tetanus vaccination. Another example is that vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella are no longer made as separate antigens, and the Department now requires the combination form. The amendment also clarified the requirement for polio vaccination. With respect to immunity, the regulations allow for immunity to be proven by a history of measles and rubella by laboratory testing and a written statement of history of mumps disease from a physician, certified registered nurse practitioner or physician assistant. The regulations changed the Department's existing requirements for school immunizations, and are based, in part, upon recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an advisory committee of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). To ensure protection for students from meningitis into their post-secondary education, the Department added a dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV) for entry into the 12th grade, or, in an ungraded class, for entry into the school year in which the child turns 18. This is in accordance with ACIP's recommendations. Also reflecting ACIP recommendations, Tdap may be administered regardless of the interval of time between the last dose of a vaccine containing a tetanus or diphtheria toxoid. One dose of Tdap in combination form is required. The Department eliminated the eight-month provisional period and set up requirements that would allow for exclusion of students under certain circumstances. The requirements differ for single dose versus multiple dose vaccines. The amendments require a child to have any single dose vaccine upon school entry or risk exclusion. In the case of a multi-dose vaccine, the amendments require that the child have at least one dose of the vaccine upon school entry. If additional doses are required and are medically appropriate within the first five days of school, the child must have either the final dose during that five-day period or must have the next scheduled dose and also provide a medical certificate setting out the schedule for the remaining doses. If the child has at least one dose, but needs 3 additional doses, and those doses are not medically appropriate during the first five days of school, the child may provide a medical certificate on or before the fifth school day scheduling those doses. School administrators or their designees are required to review that medical certificate every 30 days to ensure that the child is in compliance. A school is to maintain the medical certificate until the child's official school immunization record is completed to ensure accuracy of records on immunizations. The amendments address potential waivers of the immunization requirements when a student is unable to provide vaccine records immediately to the school, and include situations involving students covered by The McKinney-Vento Homeless Education Assistance Improvements Act of 2001, students transferring into a school in the commonwealth, situations involving vaccine shortages as recognized by the CDC and students changing schools in the wake of disasters when the immunization records are not accessible as set forth by the Department. Finally, the amendments change the manner and time frames for schools to report immunization rates to the Department, in order to ensure the most accurate immunization data possible from schools. Schools are to electronically report immunization data to the Department by Dec. 31 of each year. In the event the school does not have access to a computer, the report may be completed on a form provided by the Department and received at the Department by Dec. 15 of each year. A child who does not have an exemption as permitted by \u00a7 23.84 and who does not receive the immunizations as required in \u00a7 23.83 may be excluded in that school year and each succeeding school year that the child fails to obtain the required immunization. The regulations do not change the requirements allowing a child to obtain an exemption from immunization requirements for either religious or medical reasons; those requirements are statutory and may not be altered through the regulatory process. This manual was originally written for the institution of the all grade immunization requirements that became effective August 1983. It was revised in 1997 to encompass school entry requirements for hepatitis B, a fourth dose of tetanus and diphtheria, and a second dose of measles containing vaccine. In addition, the 1997 revisions included the requirement for all grades (K-12) for two doses of measles containing vaccine beginning in the 2000-2001 school year. Portions of the manual are from the original document and the 1997 revision. Information has been updated to include the new regulations as well as new vaccines, schedules, minimum intervals, etc. It is written to assist school health personnel to understand and enforce the regulations requiring immunizations for entrance and attendance at school in the commonwealth. A copy of the new regulations is attached. (See Appendix A.) 4 SUMMARY OF REGULATIONS Relating to school immunizations (28 Pa. Code, Chapter 23, Subchapter C) 1) Children attending child care group settings located in schools are to follow the immunization requirements included in 28 Pa. Code \u00a7 27.77. These requirements are specifically geared towards children under the age of 5 years. If a child attending a child care group setting is 5 years of age or older, then the school immunization requirements would apply regardless of the child's location. 2) There is no difference between the list of immunizations required for school entry and those required for school attendance, hence there is no need for two separate subsections addressing those immunization requirements. 3) Attendance at school is defined as attendance at a grade or special classes, kindergarten through 12th grade, including public, private, parochial, vocational, intermediate unit and home education students, and students of cyber and charter schools. 4) Each school director, superintendent, principal, or other person in charge of a public, private, parochial or nonpublic school in this commonwealth, including vocational schools, intermediate units, and special education and home education programs, cyber and charter schools, shall ascertain that a child has been immunized in accordance with the requirements prior to admission to school for the first time. 5) All children at any grade, kindergarten through 12th, including all public, private, parochial or nonpublic school in this commonwealth, including vocational schools, intermediate units, and special education and home education programs, cyber and charter schools, must show proof of immunization before they can attend school in this commonwealth. 6) The medical certificate must be signed by a physician, certified registered nurse practitioner (CRNP) or physician assistant (PA). If the child will be receiving the immunizations from the Department or a public health department, a public health official may sign the medical certificate. A child who meets the requirements in the regulations regarding required immunizations and medical certificates may continue to attend school even if the child does not have all the required vaccinations, so long as the child complies with the vaccination schedule in the medical certificate. School administrators or their designees are required to review the medical certificate every 30 days to ensure that the child is in compliance. 7) By adding pertussis to the list of diseases against which a child shall be vaccinated for school entry and attendance, the Department is clarifying that the ACIP-recommended vaccine for the diphtheria and tetanus requirement is a vaccine that includes a pertussis component, DTaP, unless pertussis is contraindicated for that child, in which case a medical exemption for the pertussis component will be required. 5 8) The Department is clarifying that the previous polio requirement from three or more doses to: four properly-spaced doses of either oral polio vaccine or inactivated polio vaccine, which may be administered as a single antigen vaccine or in a combination form. The fourth dose shall be administered on or after the fourth birthday. (Students 18 years of age and older are exempted.) 9) The amendments also add a dose of meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV) for entry into the 12th grade, or, in an ungraded class, for entry into the school year where the child turns 18. Since this vaccine would be considered the last dose in a multidose series, this vaccine (or the next required or final dose) must be administered within the first five days of school entry, unless a waiver or exemption applies. If this requirement is not met, the school administrator shall undertake exclusion measures. 10) The regulations require that a completed Certificate of Immunization (an official certificate furnished by the Department of Health (Appendix B), be on file at the school where each student attends. The Certificate of Immunization shall become the school immunization record or the record of exemption. This certificate may be recorded and maintained in a computer data base program. 11) The regulations require that the Certificate of Immunization or a facsimile be sent to the new school when a child is promoted or is transferred. The record or facsimile may also be given to the parent or guardian when the student transfers to another school, graduates or otherwise leaves the school district. 12) The amendments require the annual reporting of student immunization status to the Division of Immunizations, Department of Health, by Dec. 31 of each year. 13) The following immunizations are required as a condition of attendance in all grades, including public, private, parochial, non-public, including vocational, intermediate units, special education and home education students, and students of cyber and charter schools in this commonwealth: (a) Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. Four or more properly-spaced doses administered in combination form diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) or diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis (DTP). If a child has a contraindication to pertussis vaccine, the child shall receive diphtheria and tetanus toxoid vaccine (DT) to complete the vaccination series. The fourth dose shall be administered on or after the fourth birthday. a. If a student, age 7 years and older started the Td series late, the primary series is three doses. The first two doses should be separated by at least four weeks, and the third dose given at six to 12 months after the second dose. ACIP recommends that one of these doses (preferable the first) be administered as Tdap. The student would not have four doses of Td as required for school attendance and would be considered up-to-date with no further documentation required. (b) Poliomyelitis. Four properly-spaced doses of either oral polio vaccine or inactivated polio vaccine, which may be administered as a single antigen vaccine 6 or in a combination form. The fourth dose shall be administered on or after the fourth birthday. (Students 18 years of age and older are exempted.) (c) Measles (rubeola), mumps and rubella (German measles). One of the properly-spaced doses of live attenuated measles, mumps, rubella combination vaccine, the first dose administered at 12 months of age or older. (ii) Single antigens. In the event the antigens were given separately, and not in a combination vaccine, the dosage is as follows: a. Two properly-spaced doses of live attenuated measles vaccine, the first dose administered at 12 months of age or older; b. One dose of live attenuated rubella vaccine, administered at 12 months of age or older; and c. Two properly-spaced doses of live attenuated mumps vaccine, the first dose administered at 12 months of age or older. (iii) Evidence of immunity. Evidence of immunity may be shown by a history measles and rubella immunity proved by laboratory testing by a laboratory-appropriate certification and written statement of a history of mumps disease from a physician, certified registered nurse practitioner or physician assistant. (d) Hepatitis B. Three properly-spaced doses of hepatitis B vaccine, unless a child receives a vaccine as approved by the Food and Drug Administration for a two-dose regimen or has a history of hepatitis B immunity proved by laboratory testing. Hepatitis B vaccine may be administered as a single antigen vaccine or in a combination form. (e) Varicella (chickenpox). One of the following: (i) Varicella vaccine: Two properly-spaced doses of varicella vaccine, the first dose administered at 12 months of age or older. Varicella vaccine may be administered as a single antigen vaccine or in a combination form. (ii) Evidence of immunity. Evidence of immunity may be shown by either one of the following: a. Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease; or b. A written statement of a history of chickenpox disease from a parent, guardian or physician, certified registered nurse practitioner or physician assistant. 14) There are special requirements for tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine and meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV). (a) Required for entry into seventh grade. In addition to the immunizations listed in number 13 (above), the following immunizations are required at any public, private, parochial or non-public school in this commonwealth, including 7 vocational schools, intermediate units, special education and home education programs, and cyber and charter schools as a condition of entry for students entering the seventh grade; or, in an ungraded class, for students in the school year that the student is 12 years of age: (i)Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). One dose of Tdap in a combination form (ii) Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine (MCV). One dose of MCV 15) A child who does not have an exemption as permitted by \u00a7 23.84 and who does not receive the immunizations as required in numbers 13 and 14 above may be excluded in that school year and each succeeding school year that the child fails to obtain the required immunization. 16) There are special MCV requirement for entry into 12th grade. (a) In addition to the immunizations listed in numbers 13 and 14 above, one dose of MCV is required for entry into 12th grade at any public, private, parochial or non-public school in this commonwealth, including vocational schools, intermediate units, special education and home education programs, and cyber and charter schools, or, in an ungraded class, for students in the school year that the student is 18 years of age, if the child has not received a previous dose on or after the child's 16th birthday. A dose of MCV received at 16 years of age or older shall count as the 12th grade dose. 17) Provisional admittance to school occurs under some restrictions. (i) Multiple dose vaccine series. If a child has not received all of the antigens for a multiple dose vaccine series described in \u00a7 23.83 on the child's first day of attendance for that school year, the school administrator or the administrator's designee may not provisionally admit the child to school, unless the child has at least one dose of each multiple dose vaccine series required by \u00a7 23.83, and one of the following occurs: (a) The child receives the final dose of each multiple dose vaccine series required by \u00a7 23.83 within five school days of the child's first day of attendance, and the child's parent or guardian provides a certificate of immunization on or before the fifth school day. (b) If the child needs additional doses of a multiple dose vaccine series in order to meet the requirement of \u00a7 23.83, the child receives the next scheduled dose during the five school days referenced in subparagraph (a) and the child's parent or guardian provides a medical certificate on or before the fifth school day scheduling the additional required doses. (c) If the child needs additional doses of a multiple dose vaccine series to meet the requirements of \u00a7 23.83 but the next dose is not medically appropriate during the five school days referenced in subparagraph (a) 8 above, the child's parent or guardian provides a medical certificate on or before the fifth school day scheduling the additional required doses. (ii) Single dose vaccines. If a child has not received a vaccine for which only a single dose is required on the child's first day of attendance for that school year, the child may not be admitted to school. 18) Attendance at a child care group setting located in a public, private, or vocational school, or in an intermediate unit is conditional upon the child's satisfaction of the immunization requirements in 28 Pa. Code \u00a7 27.77 (relating to immunization requirements for children in child care group settings). 19) Attendance at a pre-kindergarten program operated by a school district; an early intervention program operated by a contractor or subcontractor including intermediate units, school districts and private vendors; or at private academic pre-schools is conditional upon the child's satisfaction of the immunization requirements in 28 Pa. Code \u00a7 27.77 (relating to immunization requirements for children in child care group settings). 20) A grace period is when a vaccine dose is administered within the four-day period prior to the minimum age for the vaccination or prior to the end of the minimum interval between doses and shall be considered a valid dose of the vaccine for purposes of this chapter. A dose administered greater than four days prior to immunization age or interval for a dose is invalid for purposes of this regulation and shall be repeated. NOTE: The grace period may not be used with the 28-day minimum interval between two-live vaccines. 9 CERTIFICATE OF IMMUNIZATION (See example in Appendix B) The Certificate of Immunization (green and white) card will be supplied by the Department of Health to each school district. The certificate is filled out by the parent or health care provider and signed by the health care provider, public health official or school nurse or designee. The certificate is given to the school as proof of full immunization. The front side should be used to record immunization information. The reverse side of the Certificate of Immunization card will serve as the written exemption. If a parent is claiming an exemption, only that side of the card needs to be filled out. The exemption card should be filed so that the exemption statement is facing front. The wide line at the top of the exemption side of the card will make identification of the students claiming religious and/or medical exemptions easy in the event of a disease outbreak requiring exclusion of students from schools and for tabulating the yearly reports. The minimum required immunizations are shaded on the certificate. The Certificate of Immunization record card should be filed separately from the student's official record folder. A file box would be a suitable container for the record. The records will then be readily available for auditing or for checking for exemptions in the event of a disease outbreak. In addition, when immunization records are reviewed or audited, the remainder of the student record is kept confidential. It will make tabulation easier and faster for reporting purposes if the records are kept separate. The information may be recorded and maintained in a computer data base. The data base system must allow for access by Department of Health personnel for auditing, while maintaining confidentiality of the remainder of the student's record. It also should allow for easy access for checking exemptions in the event of a disease outbreak and for tabulation and reporting purposes. The certificate of immunization or a facsimile thereof generated by the computer shall be returned to the parent, guardian or emancipated child, or the school shall transfer the certificate of immunization (or facsimile) with the child's record to the new school when a child withdraws, transfers, is promoted, graduates or otherwise leaves the school. MEDICAL CERTIFICATE (See example in Appendix C) This is an official form (red and white) furnished by the Department setting out the immunization plan for a student who is not fully immunized; it is to be filled out and signed by a physician, certified registered nurse practitioner (CRNP), physician assistant (PA) or by a public health official when the immunization is provided by the Department or a local health department; then, it is given to a school as proof that the student is scheduled to complete the required immunization. A school shall maintain the medical certificate until the official school immunization record is completed. The medical certificate shall be reviewed every 30 days by the school administrator or the school administrator's designee. Subsequent immunization shall be entered on the certificate of immunization or in the school's computer database. Immunization requirements described in \u00a7 23.83 shall be completed in accordance with the requirements of the medical certificate. If, upon review, the requirements of the medical certificate are not met, the school administrator or school administrator's designee may exclude the child from school. 10 EXCEPTIONS TO PROVISIONS 1. McKinney-Vento Homeless Education Assistance Improvements Act of 2001, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 111431-11435 a. If a child has not been immunized or is unable to provide immunization records due to being homeless, a school shall comply with any and all federal laws pertaining to the educational rights of homeless children, including the McKinney- Vento Homeless Education Assistance Improvements Act of 2001. 2. Moving or transferring into a school within the commonwealth a. If the child's parent or guardian is unable to provide immunization records immediately upon enrollment into the school, the child's parent or guardian shall have 30 days to provide immunization records to the school to show proof of immunization as set out in \u00a7 23.83, a medical certificate or an exemption. A child who is unable to provide the necessary immunization records, medical certificate or exemption may be excluded at the end of the 30-day period and in subsequent school years until the school immunization requirements are met. If a student transfers again from one Pennsylvania school to another during his/her 30-day period, that student is allowed another 30-day provisional enrollment from time of entry into the second school. 3. Foster care a. If a child is unable to provide immunization records on the first day of attendance for the school year due to being in foster care, the school shall comply with any and all federal laws pertaining to the educational rights of children in foster care, including the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008. The child's foster parent shall have 30 days to provide the school with immunization records, a medical certificate or otherwise satisfy the requirements for an exemption. A child who is unable to provide the necessary records, medicate certificate or exemption may be excluded at the end of the 30-day period and in subsequent school years until the school immunizations requirements are met. 4. Temporary waiver a. The secretary of health may issue a temporary waiver of the immunization requirements if any of the following occurs; i. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States Department of Health and Human Services, recognizes a nationwide shortage of supply for a particular vaccine. ii. A disaster occurs impacting the ability of children transferring into a school to provide immunization records. 11 DOCUMENTATION OF IMMUNIZATION REQUIREMENTS OR EXEMPTIONS The month, day and year of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and varicella immunization must be provided to document that the vaccines were administered on or after 12 months of age and proper spacing was adhered to between live measles and live varicella vaccine administrations. The month and/or year is acceptable if it was clearly administered at 12 months of age or older (e.g., date of birth 6/04/10, immunization date or July 2011). A measles immunization given to this same child recorded as date of birth, (e.g., 6/04), or just immunization date, (e.g., 2010) is not acceptable. By law, only licensed medical doctors, doctors of osteopathy or their designees can sign for medical exemptions. Chiropractors' certifications for medical exemptions are not acceptable. A medical exemption for a specific antigen(s) should be documented in the statement of exemption. All other immunizations are still required. If a physician provides written documentation that the child is adequately immunized and there are inappropriate intervals between doses or a dose is given too early for the age (or any other spacing issues), the situation should be considered a medical exemption. In the event that there is a disease outbreak, the Division of Immunizations (DOI) will recommend exclusion of the student or may make other recommendations based on the disease outbreak and the immunity history. If a blood test is furnished in lieu of vaccination, the type of test and the titer should be recorded and the physician verified. The birth date is required on the Certificate of Immunization to verify that immunizations were given at the appropriate age. Statements of religious or strong moral or ethical conviction opposing immunization must be submitted in writing and signed by the parent, guardian or emancipated child. A space on the Certificate of Immunization is provided for this purpose. This exemption does not need to be renewed yearly. School officials must use their discretion in accepting the statements of exemption. The reason(s) for exemption must be reasonable, as judged by the school official. In difficult cases, Department representatives are available to consult with school personnel as to the intent of the exemption regulations. However, the final decision is up to the school official. School officials should consult with their own legal counsel prior to a final decision regarding a questionable exemption. The grade or class of the student should be indicated on the certificate by circling the present grade. Next year, the subsequent grade would be circled. 12 GENERAL VACCINE INFORMATION 1. Multiple vaccines can and should be given at the same time, if indicated. All vaccines required for school attendance may be administered simultaneously. 2. Interruption of the recommended schedule or delaying subsequent doses of any vaccine does not diminish the effectiveness of the vaccine. There is no need to restart a series regardless of the time elapsed between doses. Doses administered at less than the recommended minimal intervals or at less than the standard dose may decrease the antibody response to the vaccine and should not be counted as a valid dose. The child should be revaccinated as necessary. 3. Two live parenteral vaccines (MMR and varicella) can be given at the same visit. If they cannot be given at the same visit, they should be separated by at least 28 days. 4. Several vaccines are given as combination vaccines. See Appendix F for a list of combination vaccines. 5. Any modification of the minimum recommended interval between doses of antigen(s) shall be documented in writing by the child's primary care physician, accompanied by written parental agreement. 6. If a student, age 7 years and older started the Td series late, the primary series is three doses. The first two doses should be separated by at least four weeks, and the third dose given at six to 12 months after the second dose. ACIP recommends that one of these doses (preferable the first) be administered as Tdap. ***Note - ACIP-CDC changes April 2018*** For persons ages 7 to 10 years old who receive a dose of Tdap as part of the catch-up series, an adolescent Tdap vaccine dose should be administered at age 11-12 years old. 7. When completing the School Immunization Law Report (Appendix D): if a child had one dose of varicella and also acquired varicella disease, the child should only be counted in the Varicella Had Disease column. 8. If a student has three doses of polio, the third dose being six months after the last dose and after their fourth birthday, does the child still need a fourth dose? This is a unique situation. ACIP's recommendation for routine polio vaccination has been four doses since 2009 (at 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months and 4 through 6 years). Most physicians follow these ACIP recommendations for immunizations. Below is what our regulations require for polio: Poliomyelitis. Four properly-spaced doses of either oral polio vaccine or inactivated polio vaccine, which may be administered as a single antigen vaccine, or in a combination form. The fourth dose shall be administered on or after the fourth birthday and at least six months after the previous dose. 13 The following is what is printed per the CDC ACIP recommended immunization schedule for polio: Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV); minimum age: 6 weeks Routine vaccination: Administer a four-dose series of IPV at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months and 4 through 6 years. The final dose in the series should be administered on or after the fourth birthday and at least six months after the previous dose. The following is a catch-up schedule for polio per the CDC ACIP recommended immunization schedule. Catch-up vaccination: In the first six months of life, minimum age and minimum intervals are only recommended if the person is at risk of imminent exposure to circulating poliovirus (i.e., from travel to a polio-endemic region or during an outbreak). If four or more doses are administered before age 4, an additional dose should be administered at age 4 through 6 and at least six months after the previous dose. **Therefore, a fourth dose is not necessary if the third dose was administered at age 4 or older and at least six months after the previous dose. Revaccination There is no evidence of enhanced risk to a person being vaccinated who previously has received that vaccine or had the disease. If there is uncertainty about a previous vaccination, it is appropriate to reimmunize. Examples of the need for revaccination are children who received measles, mumps, rubella or varicella vaccines prior to 12 months of age, or less than minimal intervals between doses of series vaccines. The repeat dose should generally be spaced after the invalid dose by an interval at least equal to the recommended minimum interval as indicated by the ACIP. These issues are most often subject for discussion with parents and physicians. Firm explanations must be given that immunizations at the appropriate age, minimal intervals, routes, sites and dosages are the decisions of the manufacturers of vaccine products and how they were licensed by the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Health. ACIP has clearly stated that MMR and varicella immunizations should be given no sooner than 12 months of age. You may find that physicians and/or parents of children immunized at less than minimum intervals may state that this time deficiency \"doesn't make any difference.\" Although we can't authoritatively say that these small time deficiencies make a difference in seroconversion, these children should not be treated differently than other immunization-deficient children. Public health law and regulation is made to benefit the entire or the majority of the population affected by that law or regulation, and exceptions cannot be granted. You should remember that revaccination with MMR or varicella of a child vaccinated before his first birthday will significantly increase his or her chances of seroconversion. 14 Live Vaccines and Pregnancy Live virus vaccines should not be given to females known to be pregnant. This precaution is based on the theoretical risk of fetal infection in females who might be pregnant or who might become pregnant shortly after vaccination. However, no evidence exists to substantiate this theoretical risk from live virus vaccines. Considering the importance of protecting adolescents and young adults exposed to measles, mumps and rubella, asking females if they are pregnant, excluding those who are, and explaining the theoretical risks to the others are the recommended precautions in an immunization program. REPORTING A public, private, parochial or nonpublic school in this commonwealth, including vocational schools, intermediate units, special education and home education programs, and cyber and charter schools, shall report immunization data to the Department electronically by Dec. 31 of each year using a format and system provided by the Department. In the event a public, private, parochial or nonpublic school does not have access to a computer to complete its report electronically, it shall report to the Department by Dec. 15 of each year using a form provided by the Department. A copy of the School Immunization Law Report and Instructions for Completion are included in Appendix D. 15 APPENDIX A Annex A TITLE 28. HEALTH AND SAFETY PART III. PREVENTION OF DISEASES CHAPTER 23.
