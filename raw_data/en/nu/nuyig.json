Encompassing 30,000 square feet, the vast collection of dynamic exhibits transports visitors onto a 21st-century offshore drilling rig and beneath the massive teeth of a spinning 12-foot tricone rotary drill bit, a testament to the scale of energy extraction. The journey continues with the Geovator, plunging guests through the museum floors into the earth, then back to the Cretaceous period. Further on, \"Energy City\" brings to life the energy value chain in a 3D landscape of Houston and its diversity of energy sources. The \"EFX 3000\" offers a thrilling ride into Texas's shale oil and gas drilling country, complete with a microscopic journey into a hydraulic micro-fracture. The exhibit also highlights the Unconventional Hydrocarbon Revolution, showcasing how shale oil and gas have transformed the U.S. energy landscape. It delves into the growing importance of renewable energy sources, including solar and wind energy, and provides a glimpse into the future with ocean energy, fuel cells, geothermal energy, and fusion power.
