Western medicine, on the other hand, primarily deals with symptom relief, \u00c2 not necessarily the cause. Meditation helps to create a heightened sense of awareness, not only about the choices we make in life, but also the deep-routed cause of those issues. Through meditation you are training your conscious mind to become aware of your unconscious programming. Physiologically, the consistent practice of meditation actually changes the brain, creating new neurons and neurological pathways. You are, effectively, changing your biology - the new thoughts, beliefs and behaviors that you envision during meditation essentially rewires the brain. Eventually, those new feelings and beliefs become familiar, \"unconscious\" if you will, and hence new behaviors and habits begin to emerge. So, find a comfortable spot and focus on some soft music, or maybe chant or repeat a mantra. Sound, even if it's just following your breath, helps to eliminate sensory input from the goings-on around you, allowing those pesky thoughts to pass through rather than linger. If you are outdoors, the chirping of birds or a breeze rustling through leaves can help hold your attention. As you gaze into that soft blackness behind your closed eyes, envision the new reality you wish to create. "}
