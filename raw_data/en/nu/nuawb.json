CONTEMPLATIVE WEEK Ears T ake your ear-care routine beyond Q-tips\u00ae with this practice for energetically cleansing the ears: Upon waking, avoid bombarding the ears with loud, disturbing, irritating, or violent noises (such as the morning news or a heated conversation with a family member). Instead, bathe the ears in pleasant sounds, like loving words, sweet music, birdsong, or the wind in the trees. Eyes Rosewater (an organic distillation of roses) is a fragrant pick-me- up for the eyes. A few sprays will relieve excess heat and refresh tired eyes. Keep a bottle at your desk for anytime you need a quick revitalizer. If you don't have rosewater on hand, splashing the eyes with cool water works, too. Skin Abhyanga, the Ayurvedic practice of oiled self-massage, nourishes the skin, soothes the nervous system, and stimulates the lymphatic system. Sesame oil is best for the cooler seasons, and coconut or sunflower oil for the warmer. Use long strokes on the long bones and circular strokes on the joints. Do abhyanga in the shower; the heat will help the oil soak into the skin. Mouth T ongue scraping removes toxins deposited by gastrointestinal activity during sleep. Use a copper or stainless steel scraper, and pull from back to front of the tongue five or six times (rinsing between scrapes), first thing in the morning. Gargling with warm water mixed with a pinch of salt helps prevent sickness; add a pinch of turmeric if you feel a cold coming on. Nose T ry a neti pot to cleanse the nasal passages, using warm water and a pinch of salt (follow the directions that come with your pot and be sure to use purified water). For the Ayurvedic routine known as nasya (lubricating the nasal passages), use sesame or coconut oil or an herbalized nasya oil made especially for this practice. Dip a finger into the oil and sniff it into one nostril at a time while closing the other nostril. 800.741.7353 or kripalu.org | 23Kripalu | BODYWORK/ENERGY HEALING MARCH 20-25 SUNDA Y -FRIDA Y Professional Level Foot Reflexology, Level 1 Eileen Donovan FOR healing arts practitioners and interested individuals.

(web code UYS-161) LINDA NOVICK, MFA, is an artist, author, art educator, and Kripalu Yoga teacher who has taught hundreds of people to paint. yogapaint.com Y ears ago, I took a class in the fundamentals of artistic design at a local art school. Each week, a new student exhibition was installed in the second-floor hallway. One week, it might be photography; the next, charcoal sketching or studies in typography. There was a wonderful freedom to that hallway, an unencumbered exploration of a new language. I felt vicariously creative while there, and it made me want to integrate more creativity into my everyday experiences. Studies show that creativity increases happiness levels and decreases anger, fear, and anxiety. There's something about creativity that feeds a larger definition of ourselves. While the pull to create is indigenous to human experience, we sometimes thwart our own creative pursuits by confusing intent with outcome. \"Often people want to make something like someone else made, or paint a duck that looks like a duck,\" say Rick Roberts and Maria Thomas, cocreators of Zentangle, a technique for drawing flowing images using structured patterns. \"When their early attempts don't match their expectations, they stop trying. But when that creative energy flows unimpeded by judgment or expectation, it can provide life-changing benefits.\" Odds are, I will never be able to emulate what I saw on the art school's walls\u2014but can I define my attempts as creative? Like yoga, creativity is first about intention, and, like yoga, it can bring us into the present moment and into greater states of self-understanding and what psychologist Mih\u00e1ly Cs\u00edkszentmih\u00e1lyi called \"flow\": being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. Sarah T omlinson, author and artist, uses yantras, or geometric designs, to find that flow. \"Rather than purely 'coloring for calm,'\" says Sarah, \"the yantra is designed to positively influence your mental and emotional state, and [to help] you remember your creative and mystical self.\" Sarah says that once students open that doorway, it leads to more. \"From this rediscovered place within themselves, I often hear about their next creative venture\u2014the next poem they will write, the next story, the new series of paintings or sketches. Creating yantras removes obstacles to the creative flow.\" Harnessing the power of creativity has parallels to pratyahara, dharana, and dhyana as described in the Y oga Sutras\u2014increasing states of concentration whose purpose is to help still the mind in order to open to a greater wisdom. \"Creativity serves as a doorway to personal discovery because it gives voice to the inner world,\" says Karen Arp-Sandel, founder of Vibrant Visionary Collage. \"Collage and all creative processes are really a metaphor for life. Art is not separate. Every daily experience opens the portal to our creative channel.\" Dive into your own creativity, and you might find that a new picture emerges, one that can no longer be contained on the current canvas.

Embodied Positive Psychology engages the body in the kinesthetic experience of living the science of flourishing. There's an intellectual understanding of gratitude, for example. Then there's the full-body richness of what openhearted appreciation feels like. Combine both an intellectual understanding with a mindful attention to the body, and you have the recipe for embodied Positive Psychology. Engaging the whole\u2014body and mind\u2014integrates the rigorous science of well-being with the lived experience. Embodied Positive Psychology recognizes that well-being requires more than an intellectual understanding; it requires a multidimensional view of wholeness (which we call wholebeing). Cognitive understanding and knowing is not the same as realizing, living, and experiencing. Embodiment physicalizes an idea, making it concrete in the here and now. As the definition explains, embodiment gives visible form to an idea. By embodying Positive Psychology, you become a walking expression of the idea. Embodied Positive Psychology is the experience of Cultivating mindfulness through the body, by focusing on the breath and anchoring our attention in the present Engaging the body as part of the learning process\u2014physically moving in order to understand an intellectual concept Exploring and inquiring as much about our inner world as our outer world Sharing, connecting, and networking, because the \"we\" helps provide context for the \"me\" Leveraging the body's capacity to change the mind (instead of enforcing the mind's will upon the body). In her book Love 2.0, researcher Barbara Fredrickson elaborates on the embodiment of Positive Psychology, writing, \"For just as neuroscientific studies show that positive emotions open your perceptual awareness, kinematic studies ... show that they also open your torso, literally expanding the (rib) cage in which your heart sits. When your mind and body are infused with good feelings, those feelings lift and expand your chest, a subtle nonverbal gesture that makes you more inviting to others, more open for connection.\" There's an intimate link between the movement of the body and the thoughts of the mind. Y ou could say we can cultivate a thinking body and a feeling mind. Y oga practitioners live embodiment on the mat through the awareness brought to each posture\u2014giving intimate, detailed attention to the length of the arms all the way to fingertips, the grounding of our feet on the earth, the lift of the top of the head to the sky. Postures inform us about what it feels like to inhabit every part of our physical being. We fill the container of our own skin with our mind's eye. The more we include the whole of our body in the yoga experience, the richer the practice. Philosophers, psychologists, and even artificial-intelligence researchers who study the embodied mind contend that the body shapes cognition. Or, to put it more simply, the body shapes what we think and how we feel\u2014and, by extension, how we act.

Five years ago, I came to Kripalu for an R&R Retreat to deepen my personal yoga practice. Little did I know that this one weekend would also deepen my life and open me up to a true understanding of yoga, both on and off the mat. I learned that yoga has the power not only to make a difference in an individual's life, but also to make an impact on a bigger scale, influencing society in many different ways. I am an endodontist in private practice and also teach clinical endodontics at T ufts University School of Dental Medicine in Boston. I saw a need to help our students with the stresses they incur during their four-year training, and that inspired me to bring my passions of dentistry and yoga together. I attended Kripalu's 200-hour yoga teacher training with the goal of teaching yoga and meditation to dental students. I am now the director of mind-body wellness at T ufts Dental School, where I've initiated a yoga and meditation curriculum that is now part of all our students' dental training. This curriculum provides our students with healthy ways to handle the stress they experience during their training, and also grounds and centers them, so they can deliver the best possible dental care to their patients. I have always felt a need to give back, and I am a proud Kripalu donor because my experience at Kripalu, the people I met there, and my yoga teacher training have contributed to my ability to make a difference in my profession, in the lives of dental students, and in the future of dental health-care. \u2014 Christina P., Boston, Massachusetts, Kripalu Y oga teacher and Kripalu donorMaking an Impact An endodontist brings her yoga teacher training to T ufts Dental School.

Y ou can help.What can I say about Kripalu? Before I attended the Kripalu Approach for T eens program last summer, I had no idea that Kripalu even existed, or that there was a place where people taught others how to practice yoga and what it brings to an individual's life. I first heard about Kripalu from a close friend who was offered a scholarship to participate in the program, but couldn't attend, so she asked if I wanted to do it. I had always wanted to try yoga, but didn't know where to go or what to do. So I agreed, not knowing what I was getting myself into. During my week at Kripalu, I met new friends and learned multiple tools that have been beneficial to my life. One of my favorite tools for dealing with an intense situation is Riding the Wave. It consists of breathing, relaxing, feeling, watching, and allowing yourself to accept the situation. Before learning this tool, when I was in a challenging situation, I would normally fight back or sometimes even block it out by taking a nap. Riding the Wave has helped me improve my relationship with my mother because sometimes reasoning with your mother requires a great deal of energy and patience (which I don't always have). Instead of fighting back, I breathe and allow myself to relax. Riding the Wave also helped my relationship with friends. A few weeks ago, one of my close friends told me something that made me extremely uncomfortable and furious. I was so full of rage, I wanted to fight back, but just as I was about to, I stopped myself and realized what I was doing. I took a deep breath and talked it out instead. Riding the Wave has had a huge impact on my life. Honestly, if it wasn't for this tool, my relationships with family and friends wouldn't be as healthy as they are now. What I didn't know about yoga was that it revolves around breathing. I had no idea that breathing was the key to everything, and it's helped me relax and handle certain situations. After Kripalu, breathing has had a major impact in my life. It helps me relax when I'm stressing over homework and exams, or when I catch myself having an anxiety attack. A few days ago, I took the PSAT and before I left school, I had five minutes to myself. In those five minutes, I did the Three-Part Breath and relaxed. I was stressing because the PSAT ain't no joke. Saying yes to being at Kripalu was the best thing I've ever done. Before Kripalu, I was a complete mess; my mind was all over the place and my relationships weren't healthy. After Kripalu, my life is improving and progressing. My mind is still indeed all over the place but, little by little, it's getting there. Breathing and Riding the Wave have helped me in the process of becoming a better person. Kripalu has completely changed my life and I honestly can't wait to go back.

We have all heard stories about the mysterious power of compassion and forgiveness in the lives of others. Each time we are inspired by those accounts, we remember that we, too, can forgive. Roberto De Vicenzo, the famous Argentine golfer, once won a tournament, and after receiving the check and smiling for the cameras, he went to the clubhouse and prepared to leave. Sometime later he walked alone to his car in the parking lot and was approached by a young woman. She congratulated him on his victory and then told him that her child was seriously ill and near death. De Vicenzo was touched by her story and took out a pen and endorsed his winning check for payment to the woman. \"Make some good days for the baby,\" he said as he pressed the check into her hand. The next week he was having lunch in a country club when a PGA official came to his table. \"Some of the guys in the parking lot last week told me you met a young woman there after you won the tournament.\" De Vicenzo nodded. \"Well,\" said the official, \"I have news for you. She's a phony. She's not married. She has no sick baby. She fleeced you, my friend.\" \"Y ou mean there is no baby who is dying?\" asked De Vicenzo. \"That's right.\"\"That's the best news I've heard all week,\" said De Vicenzo. The heart is released whenever we forgive or are forgiven, even in the most painful circumstances. In ancient Hawaii, if a person had broken a terrible taboo or was accused of a crime, there was always a way out. No matter what he had done, if he could get himself inside the lava rock walls of Pu'uhonua, the ocean-side T emple of Refuge, the priests would offer a ritual of purification and forgiveness. Then he was allowed to return home unharmed. In the temple of forgiveness, we are reminded of our own goodness. If only we could help each other build temples of forgiveness instead of prisons. We can, in our own hearts. No matter how extreme the circumstances, a transformation of the heart is possible. Once, on the train from Washington to Philadelphia, I found myself seated next to an African-American man who had worked for the State Department in India but had quit to run a rehabilitation program for juvenile offenders in the District of Columbia. Most of the youths he worked with were gang members who had committed homicide. One 14-year-old boy in his program had shot and killed an innocent teenager to prove himself to his gang. At the trial, the victim's mother sat impassively silent until the end, when the youth was convicted of the killing. After the verdict was announced, she stood up slowly and stared directly at him and stated, \"I'm going to kill you.\" Then the youth was taken away to serve several years in the juvenile facility. After the first half year, the mother of the slain child went to visit his killer. He had been living on the streets before the killing, and she was the only visitor he'd had. For a time they talked, and when she left, she gave him some money for cigarettes. Then she started step-by-step to visit him more regularly, bringing food and small gifts. Near the end of this three-year sentence, she asked him what he would be doing when he got out. He was confused and very uncertain, so she offered to set him up with a job at a friend's company. Then she inquired about where he would live, and since he had no family to return to, she offered him temporary use of the spare room in her home.For eight months he lived there, ate her food, and worked at the job. Then one evening she called him into the living room to talk. She sat down opposite him and waited. Then she started, \"Do you remember in the courtroom when I said I was going to kill you?\" \"I sure do, ma'am,\" he replied.\"Well, I did,\" she went on. \"I did not want the boy who could kill my son for no reason to remain alive on this earth. I wanted him to die. That's why I started to visit you and bring you things. That's why I got you the job and let you live here in my house. That's how I set about changing you. And that old boy, he's gone. So now I want to ask you, since my son is gone, and that killer is gone, if you'll stay here, I've got room, and I'd like to adopt you if you let me.\" And she became the mother of her son's killer, the mother he never had. Our own story may not be so dramatic, yet we have all been betrayed. We must each start where we are. In large and small ways, in our own family and community, we will be offered the dignity and freedom that learns to patiently forgive over and over.Jack Kornfield, PhD, holds a doctorate in clinical psychology; has trained as a Buddhist monk in the monasteries of Thailand, India, and Burma; and is a founding teacher of the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Massa- chusetts, and Spirit Rock Center in California.
