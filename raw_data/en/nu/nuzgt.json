Yet, administrative complexities are holding up the deployment of charging points in buildings, writes Jayson Dong. Jayson Dong is Senior EU public policy manager at Chargepoint, the world's first electric vehicle charging network based in North America and Europe. Multifamily buildings count for 36% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions, therefore playing a major role in helping the EU reach its decarbonisation objectives. Yet the political appetite needed to ensure the decarbonisation of the EU building stock is lacking, especially when it comes to the provisions centred around supporting e-mobility and charging in existing and new buildings. With the right policy framework in place across the EU, Electric Vehicle (EV) charging solutions have the potential to play a major role in decarbonising the EU building stock. EVs are central to the concept of a smart building: they can help integrate renewable energy into the electricity grid and in the future will be able feed energy back into the grid, or even balance the grid when energy demand is high (such as through the use of Vehicle-to-Grid technology). Further to this, charging your EV at home is in fact significantly cheaper than charging in public, making it more attractive to consumers and therefore pivotal to widespread EV adoption. Subsequently, increasing private charging in buildings will drive major energy efficiency gains and will support countries hit domestic and international climate targets. At EU level, the revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) is the piece of legislation that will help increase the energy efficiency of buildings. With almost half of people in the EU living in multifamily buildings, and almost 75% of EV charging taking place at home or at the workplace, it is important to provide a clear regulatory framework that enables the deployment of charging points in buildings. Currently the largest hurdle to deployment of EV charging infrastructure in buildings is the technical and administrative processes when attempting to install a charging point in existing residential buildings. This is especially true in southern European countries like Italy and Spain, but is also the case in countries where there is higher EV penetration such as France, the Netherlands, and Belgium. In Italy, for instance, due to the poor and uneven implementation of the previous EPBD, there is no mandate to equip existing multi-family buildings with EV-ready infrastructure. Any installations that do take place (above 6kwh) require a certification of conformity, which is severely bureaucratic and takes months to obtain. Confusing and contradictory fiscal legislation make matters worse: the previous Italian administration created a subsidy to support the installation of EV infrastructure for residential buildings, but the current Meloni government has not allocated any budget to the subsidy, leaving it a useless tool. Whereas in Spain, with nearly 65% of families living in multifamily buildings, the homeowner's association under the Spanish Property Law have the ability to de facto block and reject requests to install a charging point. Technically some buildings even lack common infrastructure (i.e. precabling) or space that enables the deployment of charging stations at scale. France and the Netherlands suffer similar technical challenges to those in Spain but allow for the 'right to plug' for tenants, which allows them to not be rejected. However, long and cumbersome administrative delays still exist for the installation process. Belgium meanwhile is so fragmented that there are three different interpretations and processes for Flanders, Wallonia, and the Brussels-Capital-Region that make it extremely confusing to assess how to start the process in the first place. Within this context, having an ambitious and forward-looking EPBD is crucial to support the uptake of e-mobility across Europe. Co-legislators need to address these issues by providing clear and transparent rules for EV charging at EU level, especially within existing residential buildings. This, combined with a strong and coherent 'right to plug' mandate for EU citizens, is needed to ensure that no one can be rejected from installing a charge point in their building. As the EU institutions enter trilogues on the file, it is evident that the European Parliament position is more ambitious compared to that of the Council, however, the many exemptions to the installation of both infrastructure (pre-cabling and electrical installation) will only lead to a confusing and non-coherent implementation across Europe. As the e-mobility sector continues to grow across Europe, especially as we approach 2035, the target date to end sales of CO2 emitting vehicles, EV charging in buildings is becoming an increasingly relevant issue. More charging capacity will be needed as we continue to charge predominantly in private settings. At the same time, EVs and charging infrastructure can play a critical role in making buildings energy efficient, managing grid capacity through smart charging and eventually bidirectional charging, while contributing to the EU's Green Deal objectives. Policymakers must now seize the opportunity to ensure that all Europeans can charge their electric vehicles at home and work, where the majority of EV charging takes place already today.
