It's ideal to follow certain lifestyle choices to practice at home to help supplement the care you receive from your chiropractor. At [Dr. Gena Chiropractic](https://www.drgenachiropractic.com/), your favorite family chiropractor in Plantation, we always suggest that our patients follow the five pillars of health: proper nutrition, adequate motion, quality rest, positive mental attitude and a properly functioning nervous system, which is where chiropractic care comes into play. Those other four pillars are the lifestyle choices that we recommend in order to complete the puzzle of optimum health and wellness. Proper Nutrition It's important to eat a balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains, and limit your intake of things like added sugars. Dr. Gena likes to encourage \"eating the rainbow,\" meaning eat foods that are a variety of colors. Stay away from processed foods as much as possible, and make sure you are incorporating nutrient-dense meals. If you have further questions about following a healthy dietary lifestyle, we recommend speaking with a licensed nutritionist. Healthy eating looks different for everyone, especially for those who may have certain dietary restrictions or allergies, so don't be afraid to ask for help if needed. Adequate Motion Get in that exercise, even if it's just for 10 minutes each day! Movement is so important, and not just physically. Staying active is good for our mental health as well. This doesn't just mean you need to go to the gym and lift weights. Yes, that is a great way to stay active and move the body, but you can also go for walks, bike rides, play your favorite sports, or even just playing with your children. Good core strengthening and stretching exercises work wonders to keep the body strong, and will help to hold your adjustments in between visits. Pilates and yoga are excellent ways to train your core and learn how to stretch properly. Be sure to focus on stretching your extensor muscles, which are often overused because of the forward-head posture seen so often because of laptop, tablet and cell phone use. Extensor muscles are the muscles that increase the angle between members of a limb. Examples include Getting a good night's sleep is key to living life without disruption. Your energy levels will be up so you can be more productive during the day and your mood will be better. Adequate rest is not only important to improve quality of life, but it's necessary for our physical health as well. Our bodies need sleep in order to repair themselves. While you lie in bed getting that beauty sleep, your body releases chemicals and endorphins that work to strengthen the immune system, repair muscles that may have been worked hard during the day, and also repair your organs and cells. If you have trouble falling or staying asleep, there are a number of free apps available with things like calming music and meditations. Many times, we hear our patients express that they sleep much better after an adjustment too. Positive Mental Attitude Chemical, physical and emotional stress on the body and mind can take a toll and really reduce your quality of life. Emotional stressors are things that can cause fear, anxiety or any kind of negative reactions and emotions. Physical stressors refer to trauma to the body. It could be something major like a car accident or a fall, or something smaller that goes on during your everyday life, i.e., sitting or standing for extended time periods, or looking down at your phone or computer screen for too long (repetitive stresses). Chemical stressors come from certain food and drinks, prescription medications, drugs and other environmental factors that cause a disruption to the body's natural state of being. Things like prayer, yoga, meditation and deep breathing can help you keep your mental attitude more positive. We can't stress enough how much stress can be a trigger, and we encourage doing everything you can to remain calm and have a positive mental attitude. Do things that make you happy, take care of yourself, and don't ignore the signs if you think something is not right. By including these healthy practices into your everyday life, plus chiropractic care from Dr. Gena and her team, you will feel good both inside and out.
