Fatigue Remedies: An Effective and Long-Lasting Approach to Fatigue and Low Energyby Dr. Ada Gonz\u00e1lez In my practice as a naturopathic physician, fatigue is the most common complaint that my patients present. I have found some simple and supportive ways to help resolve this all-too-common issue. For both persistent and acute fatigue, I recommend using therapeutic gemstones, along with supplements and improved nutrition.

Therapeutic gems are used by many doctors and therapists, as well as thousands of people around the world, simply because they work so well. The advantage of gemstones is that they support the body to activate its own healing mechanisms. Stimulants, such as caffeine or sugar, may give you a temporary boost but actually decrease your energy over time. When you wear a therapeutic gemstone necklace, you balance and strengthen your body and improve your overall energy. At the same time, the gemstones help your body gently and naturally unravel the underlying issue that's causing you to be fatigued and out of balance. Quartz Boosts Life Energy The first gem I often recommend for fatigue is Quartz. Wearing a [therapeutic Quartz necklace](https://gemisphere.com/products/quartz) attracts more life energy to the body in a gentle but invigorating way. The energy of Quartz helps you release stress and establish more balance in your life in general. Wearing Quartz can be effective not only to increase your energy, but also to help balance energy swings.

Poppy Jasper is the \"espresso\" of the gemstones\u2014meaning it gives you energy, but without the negative effects of sugar or caffeine. I have patients who put on a [therapeutic Poppy Jasper necklace](https://gemisphere.com/products/poppy-jasper) first thing in the morning to replace a morning coffee, and they say it works much better. Poppy Jasper is the \"espresso\" of the gemstones\u2014meaning it gives you energy, but without the negative effects of sugar or caffeine. Poppy Jasper can be effective for both chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. The longstanding aches and pains experienced with fibromyalgia generally come from blocks in the body's energy flow. Wearing a therapeutic Poppy Jasper necklace helps get the energy in the stagnant parts of the body moving again. This is not only energizing, but also soothing and healing. One woman told the story of how wearing Poppy Jasper had such an obvious energizing effect that her husband noticed right away. Every Saturday she would talk about exercising but would tend to procrastinate, because she just didn't have the energy to move. One Saturday she decided to wear Poppy Jasper, and she was out of her chair in no time. She and her husband were pleasantly surprised. Relief for Longstanding Fatigue Another gemstone that works well for fatigue is [Blue Lace Agate](https://gemisphere.com/products/blue-lace-agate).

Blue Lace Agate also supports inner, emotional strength, which is much appreciated by anyone experiencing fatigue. Therapeutic Quality Gemstones When using gemstones for health, I recommend using only [gems that meet the high standards of therapeutic quality](https://gemisphere.com/collections/all-gems). Only gems that meet these standards are effective for the purpose of therapy. Gems used in jewelry commonly undergo artificial treatments to improve their appearance but negate their healing properties. I recommend one source of therapeutic gems, Gemisphere.com.
