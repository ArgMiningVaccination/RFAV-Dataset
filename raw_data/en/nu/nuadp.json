Expert Webinar on \"Advancing SDG7: Regional Perspectives from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States\" Moderator Hans Olav Ibrekk opened the webinar by introducing the three policy briefs which had been released online that day. Rayen Quiroga from UN ECLAC noted that 16 million people in the Latin America and Caribbean region still lacked electricity and 77 million still lacked clean cooking. Of the primary energy supply, 33% is renewable, but the energy efficiency improvement rate is stagnant. ECLAC recommended that an average of 1.3% of the region's GDP be invested into the energy transition over a decade, which would enable universal access to electricity from renewables, generate 7 million green jobs and reduce CO2 emissions by 31.5%. Monga Mehlwana from UN ECA stated that 600 million Africans, 43% of the population, lacked access to electricity, mostly in rural areas. 80% of Africans still rely on traditional biomass for cooking, resulting in over 500,000 deaths each year from indoor pollution, with no large-scale improvements seen. ECA was focusing on expediting regulatory reform and developing bankable projects to increase investment in renewables, with an estimated need of $28 billion by 2030, including $13 billion for mini-grids. Shifaana Thowfeequ from UN OHRLLS said that the 92 countries categorized as LDCs, LLDCs or SIDS accounted for two-thirds of all people globally who lack electricity access, but they received less than a third of global financing, with international public financial flows for clean energy falling for the fourth year in a row, down to US$ 10.8 billion in 2021. Electricity access was increasing, but too slowly to reach the SDG7 targets. Hans Olav Ibrekk wrapped up the webinar by stating that regional differences are part of the energy challenge we face, but across the board we need a quantum leap in investments, in both resources provided and bankable projects to attract and utilize them. The complete recommendations can be found in the policy briefs: [Advancing SDG7 in Africa](https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2023-06/2023%20Advancing%20SDG7%20in%20the%20Africa-062923.pdf) the Caribbean](https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2023-06/2023%20Advancing%20SDG7%20in%20the%20Latin%20America%20and%20the%20Caribbean-061623_0.pdf) [Advancing SDG7 in the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries, and Small Island Developing States](https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2023-06/2023%20Advancing%20SDG7%20in%20LDCs%20LLDCs%20and%20SIDS-062923.pdf) Updated Schedule for the Policy Brief Webinars The schedule for the Policy Brief Webinars in the run up to the UN HLPF 2023 has been updated.

Expert Webinar on \"Advancing SDG7: Regional Perspectives from the Arab region, Asia and the Pacific, and Europe\" 15 June 2023 Moderator Sheila Oparaocha opened the webinar, stating that achieving SDG7 with clean, affordable energy for all presents a huge opportunity, but progress is still far off track. Hongpeng Liu of UN ESCAP noted the major challenge in the Asia-Pacific region that coal accounts for 40% of the energy supply and 60% of energy-related emissions, which continue to grow. Use of renewables is increasing but still under 20% of energy consumption, and only 74% of the population use clean cooking technologies. Radia Sedaoui of UN ESCWA stated that, with the Arab region producing 32% of the world's oil, renewables account for only 5.1% of energy consumption and need more investment. In rural areas, electricity access rates averaged 81% and the clean cooking deficit was a challenge, especially in conflict-impacted countries like Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Dario Liguti of UN ECE noted that while Western Europe and North America were leaders in the transition to renewables, in the 17 countries where ECE provides support, the share of renewables in energy consumption had stagnated at 18.2% since 2014, and investment remained low at USD 7.2 billion versus USD 56.6 billion in Western Europe. Renewable energy needed to be diversified from the dominant hydropower, which is vulnerable to climate change, but the affordability of clean technologies and fuels had been heavily impacted by Covid and the war in Ukraine. The presenters highlighted a number of key recommendations for policy action in their regions which are listed in the three newly published SDG7 Policy Briefs: [Advancing SDG7 in the Arab and the Pacific](https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2023-06/2023%20Advancing%20SDG7%20in%20Asia%20and%20the%20Pacific-062923.pdf), and [Advancing SDG7 in the UN ECE Region](https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2023-06/2023%20Advancing%20SDG7%20in%20the%20United%20Nations%20Economic%20Commission%20for%20Europe%20region-061323.pdf).

[SDG 7](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/energy/) is to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy. The goal includes reaching universal access to electricity and clean cooking, doubling historic levels of efficiency improvements, and substantially increasing the share of renewables in the global energy mix. Attaining this goal has deep impact on people's health and well-being, to protect them from environmental and social risks such as air pollution, access to primary health care and services. The 2023 edition of Tracking SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report warns that current efforts are not enough to achieve the SDG 7 on time. There has been some progress on specific elements of the SDG 7 agenda, for example, the increased rate of using renewables in the power sector, but progress is insufficient to reach the targets set forth in the SDGs. The Energy Progress Report is a product of close collaboration among the five SDG 7 custodian agencies in the form of a specially constituted in a Steering Group: International Energy Agency (IEA) International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) World Bank World Health Organization (WHO) Read the full report here: [https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/](https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/) [Executive Summary](https://un-energy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SDG7-Report2023-Executive-Summary.pdf) UN-Energy Meets to Strategize Action and Way Forward On 10 May 2023, UN-Energy met in-person for the first time since 2018. With 17 UN-Energy member organizations represented in-person and an additional 7 online, this meeting at UN Headquarters in New York was a milestone for strategic discussions on UN-Energy's activities and deliverables, and its ambition and future orientation. The discussions included specific proposals on boosting access to electricity and to clean cooking; as well as on building on the Energy Compact commitments made in connection with the High-level Dialogue on Energy in 2021. Participants also reviewed analytical work on aligning critical raw materials for renewable energy with sustainable development; promoting connectivity to meet the growing demand for electricity; and developing a common framework for just energy transitions. The meeting also included a moment of silent reflection and tributes in memory of UN-Energy colleague Dr. Thomas Fohgrub, who had passed away unexpectedly. Dr. Fohgrub was the strategic lead of the Global Platform for Action on Sustainable Energy in Displacement Settings, hosted within UNITAR. He was remembered as a colleague of unwavering dedication and kindness who cared deeply for the well-being of those less fortunate, and who always brought a positive, selfless and collaborative spirit to UN-Energy. Expert Group Meets to Strategize on Energy Access and Transition At the halfway point for achieving the 2030 Agenda, this is a big year for SDG7 \u2014 for assessing where we stand on ensuring clean, affordable energy for all, advocating for what's most needed and boosting energy action to get on track. Progress on SDG7 will be reviewed this year at the [High-level Political Forum](https://hlpf.un.org/) which is the central UN platform for the follow-up and review of the SDGs. To provide strategic input, over 60 experts from governments, international organizations, academia, NGOs and youth groups from across the world will meet on 11-12 May in New York. The Expert Group discussions will be summarized along with their action recommendations to get SDG7 back on track \u2014 \"ensuring universal energy access and advancing just, inclusive and equitable energy transitions\" \u2014 for consideration by the HLPF at the SDG7 review on 12 July, which will feed into the SDG Summit.
