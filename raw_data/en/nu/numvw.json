Certification is required for provider enrollment with the Division of Social Services, Delaware Division of Medicaid and Medical Assistance (DMMA) Program for Medicaid reimbursement through the rehabilitative services option of Title XIX of the Social Security Amendments. Through an Inter -Divisional Agreement the Division of Subs tance Abuse and Mental Health has been delegated authority for administration of certain provisions of the Medicaid program pertaining to behavioral health services covered under the rehabilitative services option. These provisions include the following: 1 ) certification of programs for provider enrollment, 2) rate setting, and 3) performance improvement. Delegated performance improvement functions include program monitoring, utilization control, training and technical assistance. The Delaware Medicaid an d Medical Assistance Program requires providers of behavioral health rehabilitative services to be certified by DSAMH as a condition of enrollment before they may provide services to eligible Medicaid recipients. Behavioral Health rehabilitative services a re medically related treatment, rehabilitative and support services for persons with disabilities caused by mental illness, and substance use disorders. The Assertive Community Treatment (ACT), Intensive Care Management (ICM), Psychosocial Rehabilitation C enter (PRC) and Residential Rehabilitation Facility (RRF) are categories of community support programs that the Division certifies as one of the criteria for Medicaid provider enrollment. Services are provided for as long as is medically necessary to assis t service recipients to manage the symptoms of their illnesses, minimize the effects of their disabilities on their capacity for independent living and prevent or eliminate periods of inpatient treatment. Delaware State Standards for ICM Services 2014 3 1 CERTIFICATION FOR PROVIDER PARTICIPATI ON 1.1 Authority - Through an Inter -Divisional Agreement, the Division of Health and Social Services (DHSS) Delaware Medical Assistance Program (DMAP) has delegated the function of certifying organizations for enrollment as providers of optional behavioral h ealth community support services to the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health (Division or DSAMH). 1.2 Certification Criteria - Eligibility for certification to provide community support services is determined according to the following criteria: 1.2.1 Organizations eligible to apply for provider certification and enrollment with DHSS for Medicaid reimbursement of Community Support Services include: 1.2.1.1 Private non -profit human service -profit human service corporati ons; 1.2.2 The Division bases its certification of programs and enrollment recommendations to DHSS upon the organization's compliance with state-level organizational, administrative and program standards that are consistent with federal Medicaid requirements r elated to Rehabilitative Services. 1.2.3 The Division establishes and applies minimum compliance guidelines to be used in making certification determinations. 1.2.4 The Division uses a certification survey to measure compliance with organizational, administrativ e and program standards. The determination with regard to a program's certification is based on: 1.2.4.1 Statements made and certified by authorized representatives of the organization; 1.2.4.2 Documents provided to the Division by the organization; 1.2.4.3 Documented complia nce with organizational, program and administrative standards; 1.2.4.4 On-site observations by surveyor. Delaware State Standards for ICM Services 2014 4 2 Definitions Assistance with medications (AWSAM) means a situation where a designated care provider who has taken a Board approved medication training prog ram, or a designated care provider who is otherwise exempt from the requirement of having to take the Board approved self administration of medication training program, assists the patient in self -administration of medication other than by injection, provi ded that the medication is in the original container with a proper label and directions. In cases where medication planners are used, the individual to whom the medication is prescribed must fill the planner. The designated care provider may hold the cont ainer or planner for the patient, assist with the opening of the container, and assist the patient in taking the medication. AWSAM is conducted with the individual present. When delivering medications to the individual in the community, medications must be in their original containers or a labeled container with the name of the medication, dosage, dosing directions and name of the psychiatric prescriber prescribing the medication. ( Delaware Nurse Practice Act , DeI. Code Ch. 19, 1902 ) Adverse Ev ents are confirmed incidents of abuse, neglect, mistreatment, financial exploitation, and/or significant injuries which require reporting and investigative processes in accordance to DSAMH policies. Atypical Antipsychotic Medications (also known as \"secon d generation medications) are those medications used in the treatment of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar conditions. BioPsychoSocial (B PS) is an assessment positing that biological, psychological, and social factors are together rela ted as significant factors in human functioning in the context of disease or illness. Clinical Supervision is a systematic process to review each individual's clinical status and to ensure that the individualized services and interventions that the team m embers provide (including the peer specialist) are planned with, purposeful for, effective, and satisfactory to the individual. The team leader and the psychiatric prescriber have the responsibility for providing clinical supervision that occurs during dai ly organizational staff meetings, recovery planning meetings, and in individual meetings with team members. Clinical supervision also includes review of written documentation (e.g., assessments, recovery plans, progress notes, correspondence) in conjunctio n with each recovery plan review and update, upon an individual Delaware State Standards for ICM Services 2014 5 re-entering ACT or ICM services after a hospitalization of 30 days or more or any time there has been a change to the course of service provision as outlined in the most current recovery plan. Comprehensive Assessment is the organized process of gathering and analyzing current and past information with each individual and the family and/or support system and other significant people to evaluate: 1) mental and functional status; 2) effectivenes s of past treatment; 3) current treatment, rehabilitation and support needs to achieve individual goals and support recovery; and, 4) the range of individual strengths (e.g., knowledge gained from dealing with adversity, personal/professional roles, talent s, personal traits) that can act as resources to the individual and his/her recovery planning team in pursuing goals. The results of the information gathering and analysis are used to: 1) establish immediate and longer -term service needs with each individu al; 2) set goals and develop the first person directed recovery plan with each individual; and, 3) optimize benefits that can be derived from existing strengths and resources of the individual and his/her family and/or natural support network in the commun ity. Co-Occurring Disorders (COD) Services include integrated assessment and treatment for individuals who have co -occurring mental health and substance use condition. Crisis Assessment and Intervention includes services offered twenty -four (24) hours per day, seven days per week for individuals when they are experiencing an event that requires immediate response from a team member or other mental health professional. This includes a presence at local emergency departments and state crisis response se ttings (e.g. CAPES, CAPAC). Daily Staff Assignment Schedule is a written, daily timetable summarizing all individual treatment and service contacts to be divided and shared by staff working on that day. The daily staff assignment schedule will be develope d from a central file of all weekly individual schedules. DHSS refers to the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services. DMMA refers to the Delaware Division of Medicaid and Medical Assistance, providing health care coverage to individuals with l ow incomes and to those with disabilities, ensuring access to high quality, cost effective and appropriate medical care and supportive services. DSAMH refers to the Delaware Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health within the Department of Health and Social Services. Delaware State Standards for ICM Services 2014 6 Family and Natural Supports' Psycho -education and Support is an approach to working in partnership with families and natural supports to provide current information about mental illness and to help them develop coping skills for handling problems posed by mental illness as experienced by a significant other in their lives. Health Homes were established within the Affordable Care Act to coordinate care for people with Medicaid who have chronic conditions, operating under a \"whole -person\" philosophy, integrating and coordinating all primary, acute, behavioral health, and long -term services and supports to treat the whole person. ICM (Intensive Care Management) Team is a group of ten (10) ICM staff members who together have a range of clini cal and rehabilitation skills and expertise. The ICM team members are assigned by the team leader and the psychiatric prescriber to work collaboratively with an individual and his/her family and/or natural supports in the community by the time of the first individual assessment and subsequent person directed recovery planning meeting. The ICM team serves up to 200 individuals and thus has a maximum staff to client ration of 1:20. The ICM team serves individuals referred from office -based out -patient care, r equiring a higher level of support; as well as individuals referred from ACT services that are successful with increased independence. The core members of the team are the primary care manager, the psychiatric prescriber, and at least one clinical or reh abilitation staff person who shares case coordination and service provision tasks for each individual. The team has continuous responsibility to be knowledgeable about the individual's life, circumstances, goals and desires; to collaborate with the individ ual to develop and write the recovery plan; to offer options and choices in the recovery plan; to ensure that immediate changes are made as a individual's needs change; and to advocate for the individual's wishes, rights, and preferences . Frequency of cont acts should be no less than every 14 days, 2.5 hours of contact per month. The ICM team is responsible for providing much of the individual's treatment, rehabilitation, and support services. Team members are assigned to take separate service roles with th e individual as specified by the individual and the person - directed recovery plan. Illness/Symptom Management is an approach directed to help each individual identify and target the undesirable symptoms and disruptive manifestations of his or her mental illness and develop methods to help reduce recurrence and impact of those symptoms. Methods include identifying triggers and warning signs associated with specific symptoms, and learning ways to prevent and cope with symptoms. Individual is an adult, age eighteen (18) and older who is receiving person -centered treatment, rehabilitation, and support services from the ICM team. Delaware State Standards for ICM Services 2014 7 Individual Therapy includes therapeutic interventions that help people make changes in their feelings, thoughts, and behavior in o rder to clarify goals and address stigma as they move toward recovery. Empirically -supported psychotherapy such as cognitive -behavioral therapy and supportive therapies also help individuals understand and identify symptoms in order to find strategies to lessen distress and symptomatology, improve role functioning, and evaluate the personal effectiveness and appropriateness of treatment and rehabilitative services available to them. Informed Consent means that the consumer has an understanding of the pur poses, risks and benefits of each medication or treatment prescribed, as well as his/her rights to refuse medication or treatment. Initial Assessment and Person directed recovery plan is the initial evaluation of: 1) the individual's mental and functional status; 2) the effectiveness of past treatment; 3) the current treatment, rehabilitation and support service needs, and 4) the range of individual strengths that can act as resources to the person and his/her team in pursuing goals. The results of the information gathering and analysis are used to establish the initial recovery plan to achieve individual goals and support recovery. Completed the day of admission, the individual's initial assessment and recovery plan guides team services until the comprehen sive assessment and full person directed recovery plan is completed. Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) include approaches to support individuals and build skills in a range of activities of daily living, including but not limited to finding h ousing, performing household activities, increased independence in carrying out personal hygiene and grooming tasks, money management, accessing and using transportation resources, and accessing services from a physician and dentist. Interdisciplinary Approach is the service model whereby team members from multiple disciplines analyze and synthesize shared roles and systematically collaborate and train each other in the methods associated with their expertise across assessment and service activities to reap the benefits of each member's unique point of view. The purpose of this approach is to share responsibility for services to consumers and to pool and integrate the expertise of team members so that consumers receive the specific evidence -based and client -centered services they need to achieve their goals. The communication expectation in this type of team involves continuous collaboration among all members (inclusive of the individual and, if desired, his/her family/other natural supports) on a regular, p lanned basis. Medication Administration is the physical act of giving medication to individuals in an ICM program by the prescribed route that is consistent with state law and the licenses of the professionals privileged to prescribe and/or administer me dication (e.g., psychiatric prescribers, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and pharmacists). Delaware State Standards for ICM Services 2014 8 Medication Adherence Education involves the sharing of information from the ICM team members to the individual or the individual's natural supports about pr os and cons of taking medication for mental health conditions. Peers may not assist with medication adherence education. Medication Assistance is the oversight of medication adherence where a member of the ICM team observes or provides training in self -administration of medication With the exception of a registered nurse or psychiatric prescriber, all team members must receive Assistance With Self Administered Medication (AWSAM) training at the beginning of employment and annually thereafter. Team memb ers required to participate in AWSAM training may not observe medication assistance prior to completing initial AWSAM training during orientation and annual training thereafter. Peers may assist in medication assistance only when the team has determined th at only the Peer will have the most success in helping the individual adhere to a prescribed medication regimen; this allowance must be time limited along with a plan to disengage the peer from providing this service in addition to pre -approval by DSAMH. Medication Error is any error in prescribing, administering or delivering a specific medication, including errors in writing or transcribing the prescription, in obtaining and administering the correct medication, in the correct dosage, in the correct fo rm, and at the correct time. Medication Management is a collaborative effort between the individual and the psychiatric prescriber with the participation of the team to provide training in medication adherence and to carefully evaluate the individual's pr evious experience with psychotropic medications and side - effects; to identify and discuss the benefits and risks of psychotropic and other medication; to choose a medication treatment; and to establish a method to prescribe and evaluate medication response according to evidence -based practice standards. Nurse Licensure Compact is a nurse who is licensed in one of the participating Compact (Multi - State) Licensure states. A compact license allows a licensed Registered Nurse (RN) or Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) to work in another state without having to obtain licensure in that state. The state where the nurse is licensed and the state where the nurse works both must be parties to the compact agreement. Peer Support and Wellness Recovery Services are serv ices provided by team members who have experience as recipients of mental health services. The role of the peer support includes providing services that serve to validate individuals' experiences, provide guidance and encouragement to individuals to take responsibility for and actively participate in their own recovery, and help individuals identify, understand, and combat stigma and discrimination against mental illness and develop strategies to reduce individuals' self -imposed stigma. The DSAMH Scope of Practice for peers shall be the guide for utilizing this resource. Delaware State Standards for ICM Services 2014 9 Person -Directed Recovery plan (PDRP) is the product of a continuing process involving each individual, his/her family and/or natural supports in the community, and the ICM team, which tailors service activity and intensity to meet the individual's specific treatment, rehabilitation, and support needs. The written recovery plan documents the individual's strengths, resources, self-determined goals, and the services necessary to help the indi vidual achieve them. The plan also delineates the roles and responsibilities of the team members who work collaboratively with each individual in carrying out the services. Primary care manager under the supervision of the Team Leader, the primary care manager leads and coordinates the activities of the individual treatment team (and is the team member who has primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining a therapeutic relationship with an individual on a continuing basis, whether the individua l is in the hospital, in the community, or involved with other agencies. In addition, he or she is the responsible team member to be knowledgeable about the individual's life, circumstances, and goals and desires. The primary care manager develops and co llaborates with the individual to write the person directed recovery plan, offers options and choices in the recovery plan, ensures that immediate changes are made as the individual's needs change, and advocates for the individual's wishes, rights, and pre ferences. The primary care manager also works with other community resources, including individual -run services, to coordinate activities and integrate other agency or service activities into the overall service plan with the individual. The primary care m anager provides individual supportive therapy and provides primary support and education to the family and/or support system and other significant people. In most cases the primary practitioner is the first team member available to the individual in crisis . The primary care manager shares these service activities with other members of the team who are responsible to perform them when the primary care manager is not working. Program refers to the ICM services team that provides service in accordance with th ese standards. Psychiatric Prescriber means a physician or psychiatric nurse practitioner, licensed by the State of Delaware who has specific clinical experience in the treatment of mental health disorders. Psychiatric Prescribers must have specific tra ining in pharmacology and in applicability of psychotropic medications used with individuals who have a mental health diagnosis and have full privileges to diagnosis mental health disorders and prescribe psychotropic medications by virtue of their professi onal license. Psychotropic Medication is any drug used to treat, manage, or control psychiatric symptoms or behavior, including but not limited to antipsychotic, antidepressant, mood -stabilizing or anti - anxiety agents. Delaware State Standards for ICM Services 2014 10 Recovery Plan Review is a tho rough, written summary describing the individual's and the interdisciplinary team's evaluation of the individual's progress/goal attainment, the effectiveness of the interventions , and satisfaction with services since the last person directed recovery plan . The Recovery Plan Review provides a basis for making needed refinements in the individual's service plan and includes active participation by the individual served. Recovery Planning Meeting is a regularly scheduled meeting conducted under the supervis ion of the team leader and the psychiatric prescriber. The purpose of the meeting is for the staff, and the individual and his/her family/natural supports (all working as a team) to thoroughly prepare for their work together. The group meets together to pr esent and integrate the information collected through assessment to learn as much as possible about the individual's life, his/her experience with mental illness, and the type and effectiveness of the past treatment they have received. The presentations an d discussions at these meetings make it possible for all staff to be familiar with each individual and his/her goals and aspirations and for each individual to become familiar with each team member; to participate in the ongoing assessment and reformulatio n of strengths, resources, and service needs/issues; to problem -solve treatment strategies and rehabilitation options; and to fully understand the recovery plan rationale in order to carry out the plan for each goal . Service Coordination is a process of o rganization and coordination within the interdisciplinary team to carry out the range of treatment, rehabilitation, and support services each individual expects to receive in accordance with his or her written person directed recovery plan and that are res pectful of the individual's wishes. Service coordination also includes coordination with community resources, including individual self -help and advocacy organizations that promote recovery. Delaware State Standards for ICM Services 2014 11 Serious and Persistent Mental Illness (SPMI) is an adult with a serious and persistent mental illness, \"1\" below must be met, in addition to either \"2\", \"3\", or \"4\": 1. Designated Mental Illness The individual is 18 years of age or older and currently meets the criteria for a DSM-5 psychiatric diagnosis other than alcohol or drug disorders, organic brain syndromes, developmental disabilities or social conditions. ICD-Coding Manual psychiatric categories and codes that do not have an equivalent in DSM-5 are also included mental illness diagnoses. And 2. SSI or SSDI due to Mental Illness The individual is currently enrolled in SSI/SSDI due to a designated mental illness. Or 3. Extended Impairment in Functioning due to Mental Illness a. Documentation that the individual has experienced two of the following four functional li mitations due to a designated mental illness over the past 12 months on a continuous or intermittent basis: i. Marked difficulties in self -care (personal hygiene, diet, clothing, avoiding injuries, securing health care or complying with medical advice). ii. Marked restriction of activities of daily living (maintaining a residence, using transportation, day to day money management, accessing community services). iii. Marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning (establishing and maintaining social relationship s, interpersonal interactions with primary partner, children or other family members, friends, neighbors, social skills, compliance with social norms, appropriate use of leisure time). iv. Frequent deficiencies of concentration, persistence or pace resulting i n failure to complete tasks in a timely manner (ability to complete tasks commonly found in work settings or in structured activities that take place in home or school settings, individuals may exhibit limitations in these areas when they repeatedly are un able to complete simple tasks within an established time period, make frequent errors in tasks, or require assistance in the completion of tasks). Or 4. Reliance on Psychiatric Treatment, Rehabilitation and Supports A documented history shows that the indivi dual at some prior time met the threshold Delaware State Standards for ICM Services 2014 12 for 3 (above), but the symptoms and/or functioning problems are currently attenuated by medication or psychiatric rehabilitation and supports. Medication refers to psychotropic medications which may control certai n primary manifestations of mental disorder; e.g. hallucinations, but may or may not affect functional limitations imposed by the mental disorder. Psychiatric rehabilitation and supports refer to highly structured and supportive settings which may greatly reduce the demands placed on the individual and thereby, minimize overt symptoms and signs of the underlying mental disorder. Social and Community Integration Skills Training provides support to individuals in managing social and interpersonal relationsh ips and leisure time activities, with an emphasis on skills acquisition and generalization in integrated community -based settings. Supported Education provides the opportunities, resources, and supports to individuals with mental illness so that they may gain admission to and succeed in the pursuit of education including completing high school, (or obtaining a GED), post -secondary education and vocational school. Supported Employment is a service providing on -going individualized support to learn a new job or maintain a job in competitive or customized integrated work setting that meets job and career goals, including self employment, and are compensated at or above the minimum wage, in line with compensation to employees with the same or similar work by i ndividuals without disabilities. Trauma -Informed organizations, programs, and services are based on an understanding of the vulnerabilities of triggers of trauma survivors that traditional services delivery approaches may exacerbate, so that these servic es and programs can be more supportive and avoid re - traumatization. Trauma -informed organizations take the steps necessary to make certain that, every part of its organization, management, and service delivery system is assessed and potentially modified t o include a basic understanding of how trauma affects the life of an individual seeking services. Vocational Services include work -related services to help individuals value, find, and maintain meaningful employment in community -based settings. Weekly Individual Contact Schedule is a written schedule of the specific interventions or service contacts (i.e., by whom, when, for what duration, and where) that the ICM Team uses to help guide the goals and objectives in an individual's person directed recover y plan. The team shall maintain an up -to-date weekly individual contact schedule for each individual in accordance with the person directed recovery plan. Delaware State Standards for ICM Services 2014 13 Wellness Management and Recovery Services are a combination of psychosocial approaches to working in partnership with the individual to build and apply skills related to his or her recovery, including development of recovery strategies, building social support, reducing relapses, using medication effectively, coping with stress, coping with problems and symptoms, attending to physical needs and getting needs met within the mental health system, medical system and community. 3 Admission and Discharge Criteria 3.1 Admission Criteria Eligible recipients are certified by the psychiatric prescriber as being in medical need of program services in accordance with an assessment procedure approved by the Division for use in determining that individuals are diagnosed with mental health conditions according to criteria for severity of disability associate d with mental illness. The assessment must provide supporting evidence of the following criteria: 3.1.1 Severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) that seriously impairs an individual's functioning in community living. Priority is given to people with schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders (e.g., schizoaffective disorder), and bipolar disorder because these illnesses more often cause long -term psychiatric disability. Individuals must have a primary mental health diagnosis or co - occurring serious mental illness and substance use condition. Individuals with a sole diagnosis of a substance use disorder, mental retardation, brain injury or personality disorders are not the intended individuals for ICM services. Individuals with SMI may have a history of repeated hospitalizations and/or may be individuals who have not been able to remain abstinent from drugs or alcohol. Diagnoses that would otherwise be excluded from ICM services may be considered for an ICM team if an assessment by the team supports I CM services as the best course of service. Delaware State Standards for ICM Services 2014 14 3.1.2 Significant impairments as demonstrated by at least one of the following conditions: 3.1.2.1 Significant difficulty consistently performing the range of practical daily living tasks required for basic adult functioning in the community (e.g., caring for personal business affairs; obtaining medical, legal, and housing services; recognizing and avoiding common dangers or hazards to self and possessions; meeting nutritional needs; maintaining personal hygiene) or persisten t or recurrent difficulty performing daily living tasks except with significant support or assistance from others such as friends, family, relatives or the ICM team. 3.1.2.2 Significant difficulty maintaining consistent employment at a self - sustaining level or s ignificant difficulty consistently carrying out the homemaker role, e.g., household meal preparation, washing clothes, budgeting, or child -care tasks and responsibilitie s. 3.1.2.3 Significant difficulty maintaining a safe living situation (e.g., repeated eviction s or loss of housing) . 3.1.2.4 Continuous high -service needs as demonstrated by at least one of the following: 3.1.2.4.1 Co-occurring substance use and SPMI or SMI of significant duration, e.g., greater than six month s. 3.1.2.4.2 High risk or recent history of criminal justice involvement, e.g., arrest and incarceratio n. 3.1.2.4.3 Difficulty effectively utilizing traditional office -based outpatient services or other less -intensive community - based programs, e.g., individual fails to progress, drops out of service . 3.1.3 Documentation of admission shall include: 3.1.3.1 Evidence that one of the criteria in \u00a7 3.1.2.4 is met; 3.1.3.2 The reasons for admission as stated by both the individual and the team. 3.1.3.3 The signature of the psychiatric prescriber.
