ICD-11, for the rst time, included a Traditional Medicine (TM) chap ter with its module one referring to disorders and patterns which originated in ancient Chinese Medicine and are c ommonly used in China, Japan, Korea, and elsewhere around the w orld. Inclusion of TM in ICD-11 is no t only a landmark f or the ICD system but also a well-regulated all TM systems of the w orld. This enables collection and statistical analysis of health system data, beyond the c onventional medicine, thus allo wing f or far more comprehensiv e and holistic picture of the c omple x matrix that forms the health system. This initiativ e is in line with the WHO T raditional Medicine Strategy (2014-2023), demonstrating WHO's appreciation of the c ontributions of TM systems to healthcare w orldwide. It also acts upon the current needs of the Member States in their activ e pursuit to achie ve Univ ersal Health C overage. The inclusion on TM chap ter in ICD will hav e critical and positiv e long-term impacts on TM in areas such as impro ved service quality , patient saf ety, education, research, and regulation. In addition, this initiativ e contributes to the possibility of progressiv e ref orms of healthcare systems across the globe, through inf ormed, evidenc e based and appropriate integration of TM with c onventional medicine within the existing health systems. ICD-11 w ould facilitate this proc ess by the possibility of dual c oding that is integral to the TM Chap ter. The c oding w ould always include a categor y from Chap ters 1-24 of the ICD-11. TM c oding will be supplementar y to this, which shall allo w the users f or easy cross ref erenc e of diagnosis and data from the perspectiv es of div erse medical systems. The TM chap ter shall no t be used f or reporting mortality to avoid ambiguity in this crucial objectiv e of ICD. 10STANDARDISA THE INDIAN PERSPEC TIVE. Traditional and C omplementar y Medicine play an important role in k eeping our population healthy. Most c ountries regard their T raditional Medicine Systems with pride and c onsider them a precious part of their heritage. As w e all kno w, the Alma Ata declaration of 1978 that sought to pro vide Health f or All also mentions the role of TM and its practitioners in primar y health care in diff erent Member States of WHO. Yet, it is a fact that the role of T raditional Systems of Medicine in public health is of ten o verlook ed at the policy le vel in most countries. Consequently , these systems are of ten no t able to perf orm to their potential in addressing public health challenges, globally. It is estimated that o ver one-third of the population in de veloping c ountries lacks ac cess to essential medicines. But a signicant f eature, according to the World Health Organization, is that traditional medicine meets the primar y healthcare needs of almost 80% of the de veloping w orld' s rural population. Traditional medicines and plant -based products hav e suc ceeded in k eeping the humankind healthy f or thousands of y ears. Though modern medicine has brought great relief to our species b y controlling c ommunicable diseases, it does not off er satisfactor y solutions f or a wide variety of health challenges relating to chronic ailments, lifestyle and ageing. The strengths of traditional and alternativ e medical systems include their holistic approach, affordability and natural origin of the remedies the y off er. But the quality of medicinal products in terms of saf ety and efcacy is a crucial factor for their ac ceptanc e by bo th practitioners as w ell as c onsumers. Adherenc e to quality standards pro vides credibility to the product on one hand in the mark eting side and c ondenc e to the practitioner on the o ther hand in the clinical side. Today , many questions are raised on the scientic basis of traditional medicine, and on their quality , safety and efcacy. For enabling consumers to use these remedies with c ondenc e, it is nec essar y to hav e quality assured products. Contribution of WHO in the progressiv e development of T raditional and Complementar y medicine and bringing it to the f orefront of health deliv ery system across the globe has been c ommendable. The WHO T raditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023 addresses the signicant challenges fac ed b y TM Systems. 11INCLUSION OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE IN ICD-11 Member states of the W orld Health Organization (WHO) adop ted the ele venth re vision of the International Statistical Classication of Diseases and R elated Health Problems (ICD-11) on 25 May 2019.

Traditional and C omplementar y Medicine play an important role in k eeping our population healthy. Most c ountries regard their T raditional Medicine Systems with pride and c onsider them a precious part of their heritage. As w e all kno w, the Alma Ata declaration of 1978 that sought to pro vide Health f or All also mentions the role of TM and its practitioners in primar y health care in diff erent Member States of WHO. Yet, it is a fact that the role of T raditional Systems of Medicine in public health is of ten o verlook ed at the policy le vel in most countries. Consequently , these systems are of ten no t able to perf orm to their potential in addressing public health challenges, globally. It is estimated that o ver one-third of the population in de veloping c ountries lacks ac cess to essential medicines. But a signicant f eature, according to the World Health Organization, is that traditional medicine meets the primar y healthcare needs of almost 80% of the de veloping w orld' s rural population. Traditional medicines and plant -based products hav e suc ceeded in k eeping the humankind healthy f or thousands of y ears. Though modern medicine has brought great relief to our species b y controlling c ommunicable diseases, it does not off er satisfactor y solutions f or a wide variety of health challenges relating to chronic ailments, lifestyle and ageing. The strengths of traditional and alternativ e medical systems include their holistic approach, affordability and natural origin of the remedies the y off er. But the quality of medicinal products in terms of saf ety and efcacy is a crucial factor for their ac ceptanc e by bo th practitioners as w ell as c onsumers. Adherenc e to quality standards pro vides credibility to the product on one hand in the mark eting side and c ondenc e to the practitioner on the o ther hand in the clinical side. Today , many questions are raised on the scientic basis of traditional medicine, and on their quality , safety and efcacy. For enabling consumers to use these remedies with c ondenc e, it is nec essar y to hav e quality assured products. Contribution of WHO in the progressiv e development of T raditional and Complementar y medicine and bringing it to the f orefront of health deliv ery system across the globe has been c ommendable. The WHO T raditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023 addresses the signicant challenges fac ed b y TM Systems. 11made inroads into distant geographies of Europe and the Americas. Yoga & Naturopathy are drugless systems which are being practised b y the y oung and old alik e, to achie ve and maintain good health. Now-a-days, practic e of Y oga has bec ome a part of e veryday lif e, across the globe. The Unani System has grown out of the fusion of the traditional kno wledge of ancient civilizations lik e Egyp t, Arabia, Iran, China, Syria and India. It is practic ed in many c ountries of C entral Asia and the Middle East as w ell. The Siddha System originated in the southern parts of India and is practic ed in c ountries lik e Sri Lanka and Malaysia also. Sowa Rigpa, commonly kno wn as Amchi medicine, is practised in many parts of the Himalayan region. So wa Rigpa has also been rec ently rec ogniz ed b y Go vt. of India as traditional system of medicine. Thus, all the AYUSH systems already hav e international f ootprints. Sinc e inc eption, it has been the objectiv e of the Ministr y of AYUSH to f orge international partnerships within the WHO framew ork f or mainstreaming the T raditional Healthcare Systems. The support India rec eived from diff erent c ountries in this regard has been tremendous. The Ministr y feels that the time has no w come to tak e the eff orts to globalise these TM Systems to a higher le vel of f ocus, and greater specialisation. Globalisation requires a c ommon framew ork f or communicating the details of these medicine systems in various c onte xts lik e medical research, clinical diagnosis, medical statistics etc. Modern medicine has solv ed this problem b y setting up a global classication system called International Classication of Diseases or \"ICD\" which facilitates seamless c ommunication in such varied c onte xts.
