India was magnificently advanced in knowledge traditions and practices during the ancient and medieval times. The intellectual achievements of Indian thought are found across several fields of study in ancient Indian texts ranging from the Vedas and the Upanishads to a whole range of scriptural, philosophical, scientific, technical and artistic sources. As knowledge of India's traditions and practices has become restricted to a few erudite scholars who have worked in isolation, CBSE seeks to introduce a course in which an effort is made to make it common knowledge once again. Moreover, during its academic interactions and debates at key meetings with scholars and experts, it was decided that CBSE may introduce a course titled 'Knowledge Traditions and Practices of India' as a new Elective for classes XI - XII from the year 2012-13. It has been felt that there are many advantages of introducing such a course in our education system. As such in India, there is a wide variety and multiplicity of thoughts, languages, lifestyles and scientific, artistic and philosophical perceptions. The rich classical and regional languages of India, which are repositories of much of the ancient wisdom, emerge from the large stock of the shared wealth of a collective folklore imagination. A few advantages given below are self explanatory. India is a land of knowledge and traditions and through this course the students will become aware of our ancient land and culture. Learning about any culture particularly one's own culture - whatever it may be - builds immense pride and self-esteem. That builds a community and communities build harmony. The students will be learning from the rich knowledge and culture and will get an objective insight into the traditions and practices of India. They will delve deeply to ascertain how these teachings may inform and benefit them in future. The textbook has extracts and translations that will develop better appreciation and understanding of not only the knowledge, traditions and practices of India but also contemporary questions and issues that are a part of every discipline and field in some form or another. This course once adopted in schools across India can become central to student learning: each student brings a unique culture, tradition and practice to the classroom. The content is devised in a way that the educator becomes knowledgeable about his/her students' distinctive cultural background. This can be translated into effective instruction and can enrich the curriculum thereby benefitting one and all. This insight has close approximation with the pedagogy of CCE. The course is designed in a way that it embodies various disciplines and fields of study ranging from Language and Grammar, Literature, Fine Arts, Agriculture, Trade and Commerce, Philosophy and Yoga to Mathematics, Astronomy, Chemistry, Metallurgy, Medicine and Surgery, Life Sciences, Environment and Cosmology. This can serve as a good foundation for excellence in any discipline pursued by the student in her/his academic, personal and professional life. This book aims at providing a broad overview of Indian thought in a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary mode. It does not seek to impart masses of data, but highlights concepts and major achievements while engaging the student with a sense of exploration and discovery. There is an introduction of topics so that students who take this are prepared for a related field in higher studies in the universities. The examination reforms brought in by CBSE have strengthened the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation System. It has to be ascertained that the teaching and learning methodology of CCE is adopted by the affiliated schools when they adopt this course. The contents have to cultivate critical appreciation of the thought and provide insights relevant for promoting cognitive ability, health and well-being, good governance, aesthetic appreciation, value education and appropriate worldview. This document has been prepared by a special committee of convenors and material developers under the direction of Dr. Sadhana Parashar, Director (Academic & Training) and co-ordinated by Mrs. Neelima Sharma, Consultant, CBSE. The Board owes a wealth of gratitude to Professor Jagbir Singh, Professor Kapil Kapoor, Professor Michel Danino, and all those who contributed to the extensive work of conceptualizing and developing the contents. I sincerely hope that our affiliated schools will adopt this new initiative of the Board and assist us in our endeavour to nurture our intellectual heritage. Vineet Joshi Chairman Convenor's Note by Professor Jagbir Singh In 2012, CBSE decided to introduce an Elective Course 'Knowledge Traditions and Practices of India' for classes XI and XII and an Advisory Committee was constituted to reflect on the themes and possible content of the proposed course. Subsequently Module-Preparation Committees were constituted to prepare ten modules for the first year of the programme to include the following Astronomy, Ayurveda (Medicine and Surgery), Chemistry, Drama, Environment, Literature, Mathematics, Metallurgy, Music and Philosophy. Each module has; I.A Survey article ii.Extracts from primary texts iii.Suitably interspersed activities to enable interactive study and class work iv.Appropriate visuals to engender reading interest, and v.Further e- and hard copy readings. Each module in the course has kept in mind what would be a viable amount of reading and workload, given all that the class IX students have to do in the given amount of time, and controlled the word-length and also provided, where needed, choices in the reading materials. Each Module consists of: I.A Survey Essay (about 1500-2000 words) that introduces and shows the growth of ideas, texts and thinkers and gives examples of actual practice and production. ii.A survey-related selection of extracts (in all about 2000 words) from primary sources (in English translation, though for first hand recognition, in some cases, where feasible, the extracts are also reproduced in the original language and script). iii.Three kinds of interactive work are incorporated, both in the survey article and the extracts - comprehension questions, individual and collective activities and projects (that connect the reading material and the student to the actual practice and the environment). iv.Visuals of thinkers, texts, concepts (as in Mathematics), practices. v.Internet audiovisual resources in the form of URLs. vi.List of further questions, and readings. The objective of each module, as of the whole course, is to re-connect the young minds with the large body of intellectual activity that has always happened in India and, more importantly, to enable them (i) to relate the knowledge available to the contemporary life, theories and practices, (ii) to develop, wherever feasible, a comparative view on a level ground of the contemporary Western ideas and the Indian theories and practices, and (iii) to extend their horizons beyond what is presented or is available and contemplate on possible new meanings, extensions and uses of the ideas - in other words to make them think. We have taken care to be objective and factual and have carefully eschewed any needless claims or comparisons with western thought. Such things are best left to the readers' judgement. This pedagogical approach clearly approximates CBSE's now established activity-oriented interactive work inviting the students' critical responses. It is proposed to upload the first year's modular programme to be downloaded and used by schools, teachers and students. As a first exercise, we are aware that the content selection, a major difficult task, can be critically reviewed from several standpoints. We do not claim perfection and invite suggestions and concrete proposals to develop the content. We are eagerly looking forward to receiving the feedback from both teachers and students. That would help us refining the content choice, the length and the activities. We will also thankfully acknowledge any inadvertent errors that are pointed out by readers. The finalisation of this course is thus envisaged as a collective exercise and only over a period of time, the Course will mature. We know that perfection belongs only to God. If our students enjoy reading these materials, that would be our true reward.

Definition of Ayurveda A y u r v e d a i s m a d e u p o f t w o w o r d s \u2014 ayus meaning life and veda meaning knowledge. Ayurveda is thus knowledge of life or Life Science. A classi cal text defines Ayurveda as the knowledge that describes the wholesome ( hitam ), life as well as that whic h informs what is wholesome and unwholesome for life and longevity. We can see from the above definition that the goal of Ayurveda is to promote both individual and social well-being at all levels of experience. Ayurveda aims to establish the highest level of health that a human being is capable of ac hieving and its scope is not restricted to curing diseases. Health is a state of physiological, psychologica l and spiritual well-being. Several thousands of years ago, the traditio n of Ayurveda anticipated the most modern definition of health that has been trumpete d by the World Health Organization: 'Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely absence of disease or infirmity.' Ayurveda also adds the spiritual dimension to health and points out that the human being is three-dimensional an d needs to be healthy in body, mind and self. Health is a tool to achi eve the four-fold goal of life: pu rsuit of spiritual and material well-being through resources obta ined by righteous activity \u2014 dharma, artha, k ma and moka. What does Ayurveda have in common with the modern definition of health laid down by the WHO? 2 Ayurveda emphasizes that individual well-being should not come into conflict with social well-being. A happy life is that which achieves individual well-being, whereas a wholesome life is that which is conducive to social well-being. These concepts are currently in application and we have countries projecting their personal and national well-being indices, which match exactly the Ayurvedic notion of a happy and wholesome life. Integrative approach to healthcare Ayurveda is perhaps the earliest form of Integrative Medicine practised by humanity. The definition of Ayurveda is in tune with modern notions of Integrative Medicine. Integr ative Medicine attempts to heal the body, mind and self at the same time or treats the human being as a complete whole. Integrative Medicine combines mainstream medical therapies and complementary and alternative medical therap ies for which there is some high-quality scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness. Ayurveda states that huma n life rests on the tripod of the body, mind and self. Ayurvedic texts also advise that there are multiple approaches to healing that are prevalent in the world and th at we must examine and in tegrate the most effective methods to make a complete system of healing. Balance of inner environment and personalized medicine Ayurveda defines health as a dynamic ba lance of the internal environment that positively impacts the sense organs, mind an d the self. Just like the sun, the moon and the wind maintain the balance of the external environment, the body maintains itself by balancing anabolic (building up) and cata bolic (breaking down) activities by self- regulation. Each individual is unique and ha s a specific mental and physical constitution, In what way does Ayurveda conform to the concept of integrative medicine? 3 which defines the vulnerability to disease and the scope for achieving higher levels of health. Ayurveda has also been at the fo refront of advocating an approach to personalized medicine from historical time s. Advances in human genetics and medical genetics have heralded the emergence of a pe rsonalized approach to medicine today that tailors medical intervention to suit individual needs. Harmony with the ex ternal environment Ayurveda points out that the balance of th e inner environment can be maintained only by establishing harmony with the external environment. Ayurveda proclaims that the human being is an epitome of the universe. The microcosm is a miniature representation of the macrocosm and the human being is made up of the same elements that make up nature. Thus it is that Ayurveda develo ped into an ecology-conscious system of healthcare. For the people of a locality, th e plants growing around them are the most suited. Each individual has to carve a lifestyl e that considers the geographical region as well as the changing seasons. THE PRINCIPLES OF AYURVEDIC HEALING Ayurveda deals with both preventive and cu rative medicine. Preventive medicine is centred on the theme of cultiv ating a lifestyle that is most suited to one's physical and mental constitution as well as the geographical and climatic conditions. It also includes detoxification and rejuvenating programmes to enhance the strength and immunity of the individual. Ayurveda prescr ibes guidelines for developing a daily regimen that has to be dynamically modified according to the se asons. Every individual has to work out a diet plan based on constituti on, activity and the state of the digestive system. Not only should the diet be personalized to the needs of each individual, but it should also be modified according to the external environmental conditions. 4 The five elements in nature make up the human body The physical universe is made up of the five great elements or pa\u00f1camah bhtas, which are symbolically represented by earth ( prthv), ( ap), fire ( tejas ), air ( vyu) and space (ka). To simplify, they denote space and the so lid, liquid, thermal and gaseous states of physical matter and correspond to the five sense perceptions of sound, smell, taste, colour and touch. Everything in the visible universe including the human body is made up of the five elements in various permutations and combinations. Thus, the imbalance in the human body can be corrected by usin g appropriate substances from the external environment. The five elements organize dynamically into the three doas in the body and govern anabolic and catabolic activities. Vta, Pitta and Kapha are the three doas that serve as the functional units of the body. Kapha is a combination of the principles of earth and water and broadly repr esents anabolism. Pitta is a combination of the principles of water and fire; it represents tran sformation and catabolism. Vta is a combination of the principles of wind and space; it represents regulation and control. Under the influence of the three doas and the digestive fire ( agni), the food that we eat is transformed into seven structural components ( dhtus) Waste products are excreted in the form of faeces, urine, sweat and other body secretions. Wh en this transformation is completed, there is ojas or innate vitality and immunity that create higher levels of health and well-bein g. In the Ayurvedic view, when can an individual be said to possess a high level of health and vitality? 5 This diagram depicts the correspondence between the materials that make up the external world and the living body, as well as the transfor mation of food into the tissues of the body. 6 The Anatomical Man.

(Courtesy: Wellcome Instit ute for the History of Medicine, London) 7 In this painting from Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, 19th century, the position of the cakras is related to an anatomically correct spine as well as to various divinities. (Courtesy: National Museum, New Delhi) Treating diseases to restore health Disease manifests when the doas are out of balance leadin g to derangement of the dhtus or structural components of the body. A judicious use of plant, animal and mineral substances formulated into medicines by combination and processing supported by dietary and behavioural changes can restore health. Medicine, diet and behaviour are the three essential components of Ayurvedic treatment. Medicine is internal or external, regula tive or purificatory and surgical or non- surgical. Internal medications are formulated into various dosage forms like decoctions (kaya ), medicated ( bhasma), fresh juice ( svarasa ) and so on and so forth. External treatments include massage and different methods of oiling and 8 fomentation. Regulative treatment comprises of medicine, diet and behavioural changes without cleansing the body. Pu rificatory treatments compri se of therapeutic emesis (induced vomiting), purgation, enema, na sal purge and bloodletting. When emesis, purgation, oil enema, decoction enema and na sal purge are given in sequence, it is known as pa\u00f1cakarma or five procedures. Chart listing the major dosage forms used in Ayurveda for administering medicines. 9 Chart listing the five therap eutic procedures known as Pa\u00f1cakarma Ayurveda also advises to combine physical treatment with psychological and spiritual interventions like prayer, meditation, control of sense organs and the like. *** Why should a medical treatment include meditation, self-control, etc.? 10 Comprehension questions \u00be What are the goals of life? How does Ayurveda help to achieve them? \u00be Ayurveda does not consider complete health an end in itself. What is the purpose of good health according to Ayurvedic principles? \u00be What is the difference between a happy life and a wholesome life? \u00be Explain the concept of personalized me dicine as laid down by Ayurveda.

'There shall be nothing that thou shouldst not do at my behest except hating the king, causing another's de ath, or committing an act of great unrighteousness or acts le ading to calamity (2). 'Thou shalt dedicate thyself to me and regard me as thy chief. Thou shalt be subject to me and conduct thyself for ever for my welfare and pleasure. Thou shalt serve and dwell with me like a son or a slave or a supplicant. Thou shalt behave and ac t without arrogance, with care and attention and with undistracted mind, humility, constant reflection and ungrudging obedience. Acting either at my behest or otherwise, though shalt conduct thyself for the achievement of thy teacher's purpose alone, to the best of thy abilities. 'If thou desirest success, wealth and fame as a physician and heaven after death, thou shalt pray for the welfa re of all creatures beginning with the cows and Br hmaas (3). * Numbers inserted in the extracts refer to the notes that follow them. 15 'Day and night, however thou mayest be engaged, thou shalt endeavour for the relief of patients with all thy he art and soul. Thou shalt not desert or injure thy patient for the sake of thy life or thy living. Thou shalt not commit adultery even in thought. Even so, th ou shalt not covet others' possessions. Thou shalt be modest in thy attire an d appearance. Thou shouldst not be a drunkard or a sinful man nor shouldst thou associate with the abettors of crimes. Thou shouldst speak words th at are gentle, pure and righteous, pleasing, worthy, true, wholesome, and moderate. Thy behaviour must be in consideration of time and place and heed ful of past experience. Thou shalt act always with a view to the acquisition of knowledge and fullness of equipment. 'No persons, who are hate d by the king or who are haters of the king or who are hated by the public or who are haters of the public, shall receive treatment. Similarly, th ose who are extremely ab normal, wicked, and of miserable character and conduct, th ose who have not vindicated their honour, those who are on the point of death, and similarly women who are unattended by their husbands or guardi ans shall not receive treatment (3). 'No offering of presents by a woma n without the behest of her husband or guardian shall be accepted by thee (4 ). While entering the patient's house, thou shalt be accompanied by a man wh o is known to the patient and who has his permission to enter; and thou sh alt be well-clad, bent of head, self- possessed, and conduct thyself only after repeated consideration. Thou shalt thus properly make thy entry. Having entered, thy speech, mind, intellect and senses shall be entirely devoted to no other thought than that of being helpful to the patient and of things concerning only him. The peculiar customs of the patient's household sh all not be made public (5). Even knowing that the patient's span of life ha s come to its close, it shall not be 16 mentioned by thee there, where it so done, it would cause shock to the patient or to others. Though possessed of knowledge one should not boast very much of one's knowledge. Most pe ople are offended by the boastfulness of even those who are otherwise good and authoritative. 'There is no limit at all to the Scie nce of Life, Medicine. So thou shouldst constantly apply thyself to it with dilig ence. This is how th ou shouldst act. Also thou shouldst learn the skill of practice from another without carping. The entire world is the teacher to the intelligent and a foe to the unintelligent. Hence, knowing this well, thou shouldst listen and act according to the words of instruction of even an unfriendly person, when his words are worthy and of a kind as to bring to thee fame, long life, strength and prosperity (6).' Thereafter the teacher should say this: 'Thou shouldst conduct thyself properly with the gods, sacred fire, Br hmaas, the guru, the aged, the scholars and preceptors. If thou hast conducted thyself well with them, the precious stones, the grains and the go ds become well disposed towards thee. If thou shouldst conduct thyself otherwise, they become unfavourable to thee.' To the teacher that has spoken thus , the disciple should say, 'So be it.' Caraka Sa hit, Vimanasthana , 8.9 Reich, ed., Encyclopedia of Bioethics , revised edn, vol. 5, Simo n & Schuster MacMillan, New York, 1995). Notes 1. This oath is extracted from the Caraka Sa hit, one of the earliest text books of medicine in Ayurveda. The oath of Hippocra tes is a parallel in the western tradition of medicine for comparison, which in a mo dified form is widely used in medical 17 schools even today. The oath of Hippocrates is shorter than the Oath of Caraka. It is probable that Caraka's oath predates Hippocrates but it is difficult to fix the date of Caraka Sa hit as it has been revised several times over a peri od of a thousand years and different layers of the te xt may have been added in different periods. Caraka's oath is taken at the time of initiation in to medical studies, whereas the Hippocratic Oath is taken at the time of completing medical studies. 2. It is interesting to note that the stud ent is given the freedom to disobey if the teacher makes unreasonable demands. 3. Brhmaas and cows are given pr iority as they have dedicated their lives for the welfare of society. On the other hand, pe rsons who are harmful to society are given the least priority. It was considered import ant to allow patients on their deathbeds to die peacefully without being subjected to futile treatments. 4. Extreme caution was to be exercised when interacting with women, especially because in ancient times, the physician us ed to make house visits to administer treatment. 5. Protection of the privacy of the patient ha s been emphasized mincing no words. This is in tune with the Health Informatio n Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) that is enforced today in countries like USA. 6. The concept of continuing medical education is explicitly and beautifully articulated by emphasizing the vast scope of medi cal knowledge, willingness to receive knowledge from friend and foe and the need to engage in constant study of the subject. *** 18 Individualizing Diet Eight factors There are eight specific factor s that constitute the basis of a balanced diet (1) \u2014 these are nature, processing, comb ination, quantity, place, time, regulations and the individual. Nature re fers to the natural properties of a substance like heavy and so on just lik e black gram and green gram, boar and antelope (2). Processing brings about ch ange in the natural properties of food substances (3). The natural properties are modified by contact with water and fire, by cleansing, churning, influence of time, place, fumigation, trituration, passage of time and storage vessels. Comb ination is the mixing of one or more substances (4). This leads to emergenc e of new properties. For example, the combination of honey and ghee or hone y, fish and milk. Quantity refers to quantification of total food as well as its individual components. Total quantity is concerned with the total quantity of food to be consumed (5). Individual quantity is concerned with the quantity of each component of the food to be consumed. Place refers to th e origin, distribution and geographical suitability of a particular food substance. Time is of two types \u2014 absolute and relative. Relative time is dependent on stage and phases of disease, absolute time is dependent on adaptation to seasons (6). The regulations are the guidelines for eating and this is depe ndent on the signs of digestion. The individual is the person who eats, who is the basis of all habitual adaptations (7). Thus has been explained the eight important factors underlying balanced diet. Caraka Sa hit, Vimnasthna, 1.21-22 (tr. Dr. P. Ram Manohar). 19 Notes 1. Balanced diet is an import ant component of both preven tive and curative care in Ayurveda. Just like treatment, diet has to be customized a ccording to the needs of an individual. This passage from Caraka Sa hit outlines eight factors that should be considered before customizing diet regimen for an individual. 2. Black gram is by nature heavy to digest, whereas as green gram is light and easily digested. Boar is heavy to digest, while antelope meat is light. 3. It is important to note that processed food can have properties very different from the original raw material. Processing can change the properties of substances for good or bad. Some substances are best eaten raw while others are good if cooked or processed. 4. Combining different substances together can greatly modify their properties. If pepper is added to turmeric, the bioavaila bility of curcumin, an alkaloid found in turmeric that has anti-inflammatory an d anti-cancer properties, increases two thousand times. Combination of fish and mi lk is considered to be harmful for the body. 5. The total quantity as well as th e quantities of the individual components of the food to be eaten must be determined to balanc e diet. The total quantity is decided by examining the strength of digestion. The qu antities of the indivi dual components are determined by considering the constitution of the individual, lifestyle and other such factors. 6. Diet will need to be modified according to ti me and place. For example, the diet has to be different in summer and winter as th e requirements of the body will change according to the season. Diet must also be adjusted according to climatic and geographical peculiarities of a particular place. 20 7. The profile of the individual is the most im portant factor to be considered to finalize the diet regimen. The constitution, digestion, activity, habits and allergies are some of the aspects to be considered to tailor diet to the needs of an individual. *** Comprehension questions \u00be What are the injunctions laid down in Caraka's oath regarding the behaviour of a physician? \u00be What features of Caraka's oath strike you as relevant to today's medical and socioeconomic conditions? \u00be How thorough is the above list of factors for a balanced diet?
