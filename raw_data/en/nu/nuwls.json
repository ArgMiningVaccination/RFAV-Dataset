P,T-violating effects can induce permanent electric dipole moments (EDMs) in atoms and molecules, allowing them to act as sensitive probes of new physics. The linear, triatomic molecule ytterbium monohydroxide (YbOH) has emerged as a promising candi- date for next-generation molecular EDM searches, because it possesses both an electronic structure amenable to optical cycling and parity doublets in the bend- ing mode. These features enable laser cooling, highly polarizable science states, and internal comagnetometry which promises an order-of-magnitude improvement to current EDM sensitivities. Additionally, different isotoplogues of YbOH of- fer sensitivity to different sources of P,T-violating physics: leptonic sources via a measurement of the electron's EDM in174YbOH and hadronic sources via a measurement of the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment (NMQM) of the173Yb nucleus in173YbOH. In this dissertation, I describe the design, construction, and optimization of a YbOH cryogenic buffer gas beam (CBGB) source, including the implementation of laser-enhanced chemical reactions for increased molecular production. Direct and frequency modulated (FM) absorption spectroscopy and laser-induced fluorescence measurements (LIF) were implemented in the CBGB source, and LIF and separated field pump/probe microwave optical double reso- nance spectroscopy was conducted in a supersonic molecular beam source. Addi- tionally, laser-enhanced chemical reactions were utilized to develop a novel spec- troscopic technique critical to the observation of the spectrum of the odd isotopo- logues. FM absorption spectroscopy in the CBGB source allowed the observation of the previously unobserved, weak 21/2(1,0,0)2+(3,0,0),[17.68], and [17.64]vibronic bands. The 2+(0,0,0)ground state has been characterized at high precision and the 21/2(1,0,0)2+(3,0,0)band of174YbOH and the 21/2(0,0,0)2+(0,0,0)band of the odd171,173YbOH Thisworkprovidesmuchofthespectroscopic knowledge needed to implement next-generation P,T-violating physics searches in YbOH.vii Published Content and Contributions 1N.

Despite the standard model'ssuccessindescribingtheobservableconstituentsofmatter(quarksandlep- tons) and their interactions (through the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces), it fails to provide a complete description for of the origin of these fundamental particlesandforces. Morespecifically,thestandardmodelfailstoexplainthelarge observedasymmetrybetweentheamountsofmatterandanti-materintheuniverse. This observed asymmetry between matter and anti-matter three fundamental symmetries, charge (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T).Eachofthesesymmetriescanberepresentedasoneofthefollowingoperations; Charge(C):theinversionoftheelectricchargeofallparticles( +). This is essentially converting all matter to anti-matter or vice versa. Parity(P):theinversionofallspatialcoordinates( ,,). Time reversal momenta ( , ). These operations are referred to as good symmetries if their application leaves the physics unchanged, e.g., the same set of equations correctly describe the physics both before and after the symmetry operation. The C, P, and T symmetries are all conserved(e.g.,goodsymmetries)inclassicalandnon-relativisticquantumtheories; however,theyareviolatedinthestandardmodel(arelativisticquantumfieldtheory) 1The other conditions are charge (C) symmetry violation, baryon number violation, and a departure from thermal equilibrium.2 [6-8]. While each of these symmetries are violated in the standard model, there are strong reasons to expect that the their total combination, CPT, is conserved [9]. Therefore,undertheCPTtheorem,CP-violationisequivalenttoT-violationandthe This additionalCP-violationcouldmanifestitselfasnewCP-violatingparticlesorforces [10-12]. Detecting these new particles or forces could provide an explanation for the BAU. Additionally, many classes of theories which extend the standard model generically introduce new sources of CP-violation and are well motivated on other grounds besides the BAU [13]. 1.2 T-violating electromagnetic moments Electric dipole moments (EDMs) Any fundamental (quark, electron, etc.) or composite (proton, neutron, nucleus, etc.) particlethatpossessesapermanentelectricdipolemomentviolatesbothPand T symmetry. Consider any spin 1/2 particle, such as the electron. If the electron has a permanent electric dipole moment, , it must be aligned (or anti-aligned) with the electron's spin, , as this is the only internal vector which describes the particle. If the orientation of and is not fixed then the electron would have an additional degree of freedom. This additional degree of freedom would allow, according to the Pauli exclusion principal, for four electrons to occupy an atomicorbital,whichisnotthecase. Letusconsiderthecasewhere and are aligned(thefollowingargumentalsoappliestotheanti-alignedcase). Nowconsider applying the P operator. Under a parity transformation, the electric dipole moment reversesdirection( )(anelectricdipolemomentrepresentsaspatialcharge separation)whilethespin(theintrinsicangularmomentumoftheelectron)remains unchanged. If and were originally aligned, a parity transformation would result in them being anti-aligned. As discussed above, the orientation of and mustbefixedand,therefore,aparitytransformwillresultinadifferentelectronthan we started with, one that cannot exist. Thus, the electron possessing a permanent electric dipole moment violates P. If we instead applied the T operator we would reverse the spin (an angular momentum) and would remain unchanged. Again, this results in a distinguishable electron and, therefore, the electron possessing a permanent electric dipole moment would violate T as well.3 If the electron does have a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM), it is the resultofT-violating(orCP-violating)physics. Inthecontextofthestandardmodel this arises through interaction of the electron with the quarks and the W boson. The lowest-order contribution to the electron's electric dipole moment (eEDM) then comes at third order (three-loop Feynman diagrams). However, it has been shown that all the three-loop diagrams cancel [14]. Therefore, the standard model contribution to the eEDM results from fourth- or higher-order interactions and is expectedtobeexceedinglysmall, ||1044\u00b7cm[15]. However,theexistenceof new BSM could a non-zero eEDM. Interactions betweentheelectronandtheT-violatingparticlecouldresultinanon-zerovalueof the eEDM. This is similar to the leading contributions to the electron's anomalous magnetic moment arising from one-loop interactions with the photon. One-loop Feynman diagrams which contribute to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the eEDM (in the case of a super symmetric BSM model) are shown in Fig. 1.1 of Ref. [16]. Consider the case where a new particle , of massexists, and couples to a standardmodelfermion, ,withCP-violatingphase . Thenatthe looplevel, dimensional arguments indicate that the interaction with the new particle will result in the standard model fermion possessing an EDM, , of magnitude [17] sin\u00122 162\u0013 2 . (1.1) Whereandare the charge and mass of the standard model fermion, is a coupling constant, and is a possible enhancement factor from flavor violation. Eq. 1.1 indicates that the magnitude of the EDM is inversely proportional to the square of the new particles mass, . Therefore, a measurement of (or limit on) the EDM of a standard model fermion, such as the electron, provides and indirect measurement (or bound) on the mass scale at which new T-violating BSM physics occurs. MeasurementsoftheeEDMareonlysensitivetoT-violatingphysicswhichcouples to the electron. However, the same or other T-violating physics can also couple to hadrons. Thiscanresultinthequarks,theproton,theneutron,ornucleipossessing EDMsandotherCP-violatingobservables. ExperimentssearchingfortheseEDMs are complimentary to eEDM experiments as they probe T-violation in the hadronic sector, as opposed to leptonic sector. Experiments aiming to measure or improve4 the limit on the proton [17, nuclear 2[25-30] EDMs are currentlyunderway. Todate,noexperimentalmeasurementsofanon-zeroEDMof either a fundamental or composite particle have been made [17]. Nuclear magnetic qudrapole moments (NMQMs) T-violatingphysicscanresultinpermanentEDMs. an EDM next-lowest P,T-violating electromagnetic moment is a magnetic quadrupole moment (MQM). An MQM is a tensor quantity and therefore, can only exist in a particle or nucleus of spin 1. Since all the quarksandleptons,aswellastheprotonandneutron,haveaspinof1/2,theycannot haveanMQM.However,manyatomicnucleihave 1and,therefore,canhavea nuclear MQM (NMQM). In a classical picture, an MQM looks like two oppositely circulating current loops separated by some distance . This classical current configuration can also be realizedbyanorbitingEDM.Therefore,ifavalencenucleon(protonorneutron)in anucleushasanEDM,whenitorbitsthenuclearcoreitwillcreateaNMQM[31]. In spherically shaped nuclei the NMQM is dominated by the contributions from the valence nucleons. However, in quadrupole deformed nuclei, a nucleus with a elliptically shaped mass distribution, 2/3of the nucleons are in open shells and willcontributetotheNMQM 3,providingalargeenhancement[32,33]. Inaddition to contributions from the EDMs of the nucleons, an NMQM can also result from P,T-violating inter-nuclear forces, whose contributions can be one to two orders of magnitude larger than those from the nucleon EDMs [33]. Even though NMQMs are the result of a multitude of P,T-violating sources, they provide an indirect measurementofP,T-violatingphysicsinthehadronicsectorandcomplimenteEDM experiments. NMQMexperimentsalsocomplementnuclearEDMsearchessincea measurement of both an NMQM and an nuclear EDM in several different systems will allow the exact source of the hadronic P,T-violating physics to be pinpointed. Currently, the only limit on an NMQM comes from measurements of the Cs atom [34]. 2The experiments referenced here are aiming to measure nuclear Schiff moments, the residual nuclear EDM not screened by the electrons in an atom or molecule [24]. 3Hereis the total number of nucleons in the nucleus.5 1.3 EDMs in molecules ThegoalofanEDMexperimentistomeasureanEDMorNMQM.SinceNMQMs are more complicated than EDMs, we will first use an EDM measurement, specif- ically an eEDM measurement, as an example and address NMQM measurements afterward. If you place an electron with an EDM, , in an electric field E, the electric field will exert a torque on the EDM, = \u00d7 E. This torque will cause the EDM (and the spin of the electron) to precess at a frequency =E/. After a precession time , the spin of the electron will have precessed through an angle =E/. Ameasurementofthisprecessionanglecanbeusedtodeterminethe eEDM. However,thisexperimentalmethodwithafixedlabelectricfieldhasone problem: if the electron is placed in a constant electric field it will be accelerated away, completely preventing the spin precession measurement from occurring 4. To circumvent this problem we can instead examine the interaction of the eEDM withtheinternalelectricfieldofanatomormolecule, E. Ostensibly,performing EDMmeasurementsinneutralatomicormolecularsystemspresentsissuesaswell. One of these issues was addressed by Schiff [35]. Schiff noted that when a neutral system, such as an atom or molecule, is placed in a constant electric field, it is not accelerated. Therefore,allthechargedcomponentsoftheatomormolecule(nuclei andelectrons)mustorganizeinawaysothatthenetelectricfieldtheyexperienceis zero. In this case the electron must experience an average internal electric field of zero,andsotheexpectationvalueoftheeEDMinteractioniszero, \u00b7 E=0. Whilethisistruefornon-relativisticsystems,whenrelativisticeffectsareconsidered itresultsinanonzeroexpectationvaluefortheeEDMinteraction, these relativistic effects not only give non- zero expectation values for the eEDM interaction but also enhance it. In this case, \u00b7 E=E \u00b7where istheunitvectoralongtheinternuclearaxisand E= \u00b7 E/ 10100GV/cm is the effective internal electric field. These extremely large effective internal electric fields ( 106times larger than the maximum electric field that can be created in a laboratory) make molecules very sensitive systems for EDM measurements. Since the internal electric field results from relativistic effects, it is maximized whentheelectronisacceleratedtohighrelativisticspeeds. Thisoccursinatomsor molecular states with a large overlap of the electron's wavefuction and the nucleus, 4You could circumvent this problem by doing the experiment in a storage ring. However, performingtheexperimentwithanatomicormolecularsystemprovidesmanyadvantageousfeatures as we shall see.6 meaning states with large s- and p-like content. Additionally, the internal electric field scales with the atomic number roughly as 3[36], making heavy atoms or molecules containing heavy atoms extremely sensitive to EDM measurements. The eEDM interaction in an atom or molecule is described by the P,T-violating effective atomic/molecular Hamiltionian = \u00b7 E, (1.2) where E=E,and istheinternuclearaxis. Intheabsenceofexternalfields, the total atomic or molecular Hamiltonian is rotationally symmetric and, therefore, the expectation value of the parity-odd vector quantity E=0. If an external electric field, E, is applied, it breaks the rotational symmetry and polarizes or orients the atoms or molecules in the lab frame by mixing states of opposite parity. Inthiscase, E0andisnowproportionaltothedegreetowhichtheatomor molecule is polarized, thus Ewhere 0 < 1is the polarization. The expectation value of the internal electric field takes its maximum value when the atom or molecule is fully polarized, maximizing the eEDM sensitivity. The atom or molecule is fully polarized when the external electric field completely mixes the opposite parity states. This occurs when the energy of the interaction of external fieldwiththeatom'sormolecule'sCP-conservingdipolemoment, ,ismuchlarger than the energy separation of the opposite parity states ( ), \u00b7 E.

If we makethejustifiedassumptionthattheatomic(ormolecular)dipolemomentisabout oneatomicunit| |0,thenweneedanelectricfieldof E1,00010,000 kV/cm to fully polarize the atom. This is challenging since the largest electric field that can be created in vacuum over reasonably large volumes in the laboratory 6 is100kV/cm. At these fields, an atom would only have a polarization of 103, which would only project a very small fraction of Efor the EDM 5This approximation is good in the low-polarization limit, 1, but becomes less accurate as the polarization increases. However, it is still helpful for making order of magnitude estimates. An analytic expression for the polarization of a two-level system can be found in Sec. 2.1 of Ref [39]. 6Abovethisthreshold,arcingbetweenthematerialscreatingtheelectricfieldoccurspreventing higher fields from being realized. However, careful engineering can result in fields as high as 500 kV/cm [40] though with many design constraints.7 measurement. Diatomic molecules, however, have opposite parity rotational states which are typically separated by 1100GHz. Therefore, a diatomic molecule can be fully polarized with a field of E10100kV/cm. Since molecules can be fully polarized, they are 1000times more sensitive to EDMs compared to atoms. Finally, certain diatomic molecules and generally all polyatomic molecules haveparitydoublets,closelyspacedstatesofoppositeparity. Theseparitydoublets are generally separated by 100MHz and therefore allow the molecule to be fully polarized in fields of E100V/cm. These parity doublets will be discussed in more detail later in this section. Finally, I would like to note that the quantity E, known as the effective internal electric filed, is a parameter which describes how sensitive a molecular state is to energy shifts from an EDM. Dimensionally, Etakes on the units of an electric field and even though it is not physically observable, treating it as an electric field provides good intuition 7. The NMQM interaction in a molecule is parameterized by a similar parameter .is similar toEas it describes the sensitivity of amolecularstatetoanNMQM,isproportionaltothedegreetowhichthemolecule is polarized, and is enhanced by relativistic effects [33]. Therefore, the discussion above is also applicable to NMQM measurements as well. Measuring EDM energy shifts When performing an EDM measurement, we want to fully polarize the molecules withanexternalelectricfieldsothat = \u00b7 E0andEismaximized. In this case, the eEDM interaction results in the following energy shift = \u00b7 E=E \u00b7=E, (1.3) whereistheprojectionof ontheinternuclearaxis . Whenfullypolarized, is alignedoranti-alignedwiththeexternalelectricfield(whichdefinesthelabz-axis). If we consider preparing a superposition of two states with opposite eEDM shifts (e.g., opposite values of so that1||1=2||2), then the eEDM interaction will cause the states to precess at a frequency of =2E. (1.4) This precession frequency can be measured experimentally. Upon reversal of the internal electric field Ethe precession frequency will reverse. The key experi- mental signature that distinguishes the energy shift of an eEDM from other energy 7Additionally, Ebehaves like an electric field in the effective Hamiltionian describing the molecular energy shifts which result from an eEDM.8 shifts in the molecule is a change of the measured precession frequency correlated with the reversal of the effective internal electric field, E. One way to reverse Eis to reverse the external electric field E. However, reversals of laboratory electric fields are imperfect and can result in systematic errors. However, in molecules with parity doublets, the internal electric field can be reversed spectroscopically, e.g., by changing quantum states. As previously mentioned parity doublets are closely spaced opposite parity states. They result whenamoleculehasanon-zeroprojectionofangularmomentumontheinternuclear axis(orsymmetryaxisfornonlinearpolyatomicmolecules). Indiatomicmolecules thiscanonlyresultfromanon-zeroprojectionoftheelectronicangularmomentum lambda-doublets. In polyatomic molecules the angular momentum projection can come from the ligand degrees of freedom, such asangularmomentumassociatedwithbendingmodes( and-doublets)orrotation aboutthesymmetryaxis. Bendingangularmomentumand -doubletsarediscussed in more detail in Section 2.3, while the details of non-linear molecules are beyond the scope of this dissertation and will not be discussed further. For the following discussion we will use the quantum number to denote the projection of angular momentum on the internuclear axis 8. For any angular momentum with a non-zero projectionontheinternuclearaxis,theprojectioncantakeoneoftwovalues |+ and|. These correspond to opposite alignments on the internuclear axis. In free field, the eigenstates must be rotationally symmetric (no directionality) so the eigenstatesareequalsuperpositionsofthetwo,creatingtwostatesofoppositeparity 2(|\u00b1|), (1.5) where|+isthestateofpositiveparityand |isthestateofnegativeparity. These states are nominally degenerate; however, the rotation of the molecule breaks this degeneracy,resultingintheparitydoublets. Aspreviouslymentionedthesedoublets allowthemoleculetobefullypolarizedinrelativelysmallelectricfields. Whenfully polarized the parity doublets are fully mixed, resulting in the following quantum states |\u00b1=1 2(|+\u00b1|)=|\u00b1.

In the following discussion one can replace withor.9 internuclear axis, and E, anti-aligned with the lab electric field E. If the experiment is first performed in |+, spectroscopically switching to the | state will reverse Ewithout changing E. This internal field reversal is not subject to the same systematics as reversing the external laboratory field. Pairs of stateswhichallowthespectroscopicreversalof Eareoftenreferredtoasinternal comagnetometer states. Internalcomagnetometersallowtherejectionofcriticalsystematicerrorsassociated with lab electric field reversals. The two experiments which set the most stringent limits on the value of the eEDM rely on internal comagnetometers to reach their exceptionalsensitivities[41,42]. Therefore,itisdesirable,ifnotcritical,thatfuture molecular EDM experiments utilize these internal comagnetometer states as well.

(1.8) If you compare Eq. 1.8 to Eq. 1.3 you can see that the energy shifts behave in the same way (just differing by a factor of 1/3) with a direct correspondence between andandEand. Therefore, a NMQM experiment is performed in the 9In Eq. 1.7, Sandare first rank tensors (vectors).

If the precession frequency is measured in states with different projections of then the NMQM shift can be isolated from the eEDM shift. Improving EDM sensitivity Here I will briefly examine the sensitivity of EDM measurements in the context of how they can be improved. Again, I will use the eEDM as an example. Since eEDM and NMQM measurements are performed using the same spin precession method, everything discussed regarding an eEDM can be applied to the NMQM. The current best limit on the eEDM is ||<1.1\u00d71029\u00b7cm [41]. This limit was set by the ACME collaboration using a molecular beam of ThO molecules. Experiments aimed at improving this limit are currently underway [43-46]. For an eEDM measurement the ultimate shot noise limit is set by [47] = 2E , (1.10) whereis the coherence time (spin precession time) and is the total number of molecules. Increasing sensitivity is accomplished by decreasing . Therefore, next-generationeEDMexperimentswanttomaximize E,,and. Asdiscussed before,E(or) is maximized by performing the EDM experiment with a heavy polar molecule. The ACME experiment was able to produce large numbers of molecules using a cryogenic buffer gas source; however, the coherence time is limited by the beam transit to 110ms. Therefore, gains in sensitivity can be made by increasing the coherence time. This can be accomplished by performing the experiment with a laser cooled and trapped molecular sample as opposed to a molecular beam. In the past decade not only has the laser cooling and trapping of molecules experiments [44, 68] are projected to improve EDM sensitivity by an order of magnitude ( 1030e cm) in the next few years (by 2024). Experimentsutilizingthelasercoolingandtrappingofmolecules[43]areprojected toprovideanadditionalorderofmagnitudeimprovementinEDMsensitivity( 1031 e cm) in the next5 years (2027). For more details on improvements to EDM sensitivity see Ref. [17], particularly Fig. 5. 1.4 YbOH for EDM measurements Based on the discussions in this chapter, an ideal molecule with which to perform an eEDM or NMQM experiment will meet the following criteria: Containaheavyatom(large ):E3and2sothiswillprovide largeE,. Have a science state comprised of valence electron orbitals derived from the atomicorbitals of the heavy atom: Due to relativistic effects, Eand are larger in states where the valence electron has a large overlap with the heavy nucleus.

These -doublets are expected to be split by 10MHz [67] and will provide full polarization and internal comagnetometers. Third,YbOHischemicallyandelectronicallysimilartothealkalineearthfluorides and hydroxides (CaF, SrF, SrOH, etc.) which were produced in a cryogenic buffer gas source prior to the work described in this dissertation [71]. Fourth, YbOH has an electronic structure that is amenable to laser cooling [67] and similar to SrOH which was laser cooled prior to the start of this work [53]. Finally, Yb has multiple isotopologues. The most abundant isotope,174Yb, has a nuclear spin of =0, making174YbOH ideal for eEDM searches. The173Yb nucleus has a spin of=5/2and a large quadrupole deformation making173YbOH ideal for NMQM searches. 1.5 Overview The work described in this dissertation is focused on the production and spec- troscopic characterization of YbOH for the development of eEDM and NMQM searches. The work related to the eEDM search is part of the PolyEDM collab- oration which aims to perform a a laser cooledandtrappedsampleofpolyatomicmolecules. TheNMQMexperimentaims toperformthefirstNMQMmeasurementinamolecularsystemusingacoldmolec- ular beam of YbOH. Following generations of the NMQM experiment will aim to increase sensitivity by adding laser cooling. The work described here lays much of the groundwork for these experiments.

Though the goal is to describe YbOH, the molecular structure described here is general and applicable to many diatomic and linear polyatomic molecules with doublet (spin = 1/2) electronic states. In addition to YbOH (and YbF) all alkaline earth metal (AEM) fluoride and and some alkaline earth metal hydroxidemoleculesaredescribedbythismolecularclassification. Thesemolecules areextremelyrelevantinthecontextofatomic,molecular,opticalphysicsasseveral of the AEM fluorides and hydroxides have laser cooled [48, 49, 52-55] and trapped [57, 59-65], and several of these molecules are highly sensitive to new physics [43, 67]. The various isotopologues of YbOH themselves have structures amenable to laser cooling and (as discussed in Ch. 1) are highly sensitive probes for measuring either an eEDM, NMQM [67], or NSD-PV [72]. molecular wave- function Thequantummechanicalstructureofamoleculeisdeterminedbysolvingthetime- independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation =, (2.1) where is the total electrostatic Hamiltonian of the molecular system, is the molecularwavefunctiondescribingaquantumstate,and istheenergyofthestate .describesthetotalenergyofthemolecularsystem,bothkineticanpotential and is given by [73, 74], =++,+,+,.

(2.7) This Hamiltonian does not include the electronic and nuclear spin degrees of free- dom. Theinteractionsarisingfromthesedegreesoffreedomaregenerallytreatedas perturbationstotheelectrostaticHamiltonianandarediscussedindetailinsections 2.7 and 2.8. The Hamiltonian given in Eq. 2.2 can't be solved exactly, so numerical methods and well-justified approximations are needed [73]. One such simplification is the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation [73, 75]. This approximation relies on the fact that the much lighter electrons move significantly faster than the heavier nuclei and therefore the electrons can rapidly adjust to any change in the nuclear configuration. In this case, the nuclear motion can be treated as a perturbation to the electronic Hamiltonian, ==+,+,+,. (2.8) In this approximation, the electron configuration for a fixed nuclear configuration, 0, can be determined. In the BO approximation, the motions of the nuclei, both vibrations and rotations, do not couple to the electrons so that the molecular wave- function can be factored into two separate parts,16 (,)(). (2.9) The electronic wavefuction, (,), describes the motion and positions of the electrons and depends on the electron, , and nuclear, while in which the nuclei move. Finally, if we work in a molecule fixed frame which rotates with the molecule we can further separate the vibrational and rotational parts of the nuclear wavefuction, =[73]. This allows the total molecular wavefuction to be expressed as, =. (2.12) This is especially useful since the energies associated with the electronic states, nuclear vibration, and nuclear rotation are generally orders of magnitude different (> > ). We can therefore view each electronic state as having its own manifoldofvibrationalstatesandeachofthesevibrational(vibronic)statesashaving its own manifold of rotational states. 2.2 Electronic structure Potential energy surface and molecular geometry The electronic states of the molecule, ,(), are determined by solving Eq.2.10. Each electronic state, ,()has an associated energy, ,()which depends on the nuclear configuration. The functional dependence of ,()on the nuclear coordinates determines the potential energy surface (PES) for the electronic state. If the PES has a minimum, the electronic state is bound; if not, then the state17 Figure 2.1: Example one-dimensional energy surfaces (PESs) as a func- tionofinternucleardistance .

Each electronic state of the molecule has its own associated PES and therefore its own equilibrium geometry. Examples of weakly bound, strongly bound, and unbound one-dimensional PESs (for a diatomic molecule) are shown in Fig. 2.1. Molecular orbitals and ligand field theory Atomsbondtoformmoleculestolowerthetotalenergyofthecombinedsystem. The bonds are made via the occupation of bonding molecular orbitals (MOs). Though these bonding orbitals (and non-bonding MOs as well) can be very delocalized, it canstillbehelpfultothinkoftheminthemorelocalizedatomicorbital(AO)basis. Consider the case of a Yb (or an alkaline-earth metal Mg, Ca, Sr, etc.) bonding to the halogen F (or other halogen or pseudo-halogen Cl, OH, etc.). The F has two filled and one half-filled atomic p-orbitals while the Yb has a filled s-orbital. The18 Yb and the F bond by filling a bonding orbital which is comprised of some linear combinationoftheYbandFAOs. Inthiscase,asimpleintuitivepictureisthatthe bonding orbital is comprised of the linear combination of the half-filled F p-orbital and the Yb s-orbital. This bonding MO is completely filled, one electron from the F and one from the Yb, resulting in a lowered total energy. Since the total number of available orbitals stays the same, the combination of the two atomic orbitals (the Yb s orbital and F p orbital) results in two molecular orbitals, the bonding orbital andanotherantibondingorbital. TheotherYbs-electronresidesinthisantibonding orbital. The more covalent the bond, the more delocalized the MOs become, and the AO basis becomes an increasingly non-intuitive description as the MOs are comprised of more AOs. However, more ionic bonds result in more localized MOs and therefore viewing the MOs in the AO basis is quite useful. In the case of an Yb bonded to F or OH, the bond is very ionic and results in a bonding orbital fairly localized around the F atom or OH radical. The picture then looks like the F or OH grabbing one of the valence s electrons from the Yb and leavingtheotherlocalizedonthemetal. Inthiscasethevalenceelectroniscentered Yb metal 2+ ion (Yb2+) which is ionically bonded to the negatively charged ForOH. Withthelocalizedvalenceelectrononthemetal,theelectronicstructure of the molecule can then be well described by ligand field theory [76-78]. Ligand field theory treats the electric field, called the ligand field (LF) in this case, from the negatively charged halogen or psudo-halogen as a perturbation to the states of the atomic metal ion M2+(M=Yb in the example above). The Hamiltonian for the valence is then [76, 79], =0+=2++. (2.13) The LF perturbs the AOs of the metal ion in multiple ways. First, the energies of the AOs are shifted by the LF. Second, the LF breaks the degeneracy between AOs which have different angular momentum projections ( ) on the bonding axis, via the Stark effect. Last, the LF mixes AOs with the same to form the MOs. In this case the valence MOs can be well described by linear combinations of a small number of AOs. Labeling of electronic states Atomic single-electron states are labeled by lower case letters corresponding to the electron's orbital angular momentum; s,p,d, and f for angular momenta of 0, 1 , 2,and3respectively.

Thevibrationalenergiesand wavefunctions are given by solving the vibrational Schr\u00f6dinger equation, = (+)=, where is the PES given by solving Eq. 2.10 and is the kinetic energy of the nuclei. If the amplitude of the vibrations is small, such that the nuclei do not move far from the equilibrium position, the PES can be approximated as a harmonic potential 1. Working in the normal coordinate system the vibrational Hamiltonian can then be expressed 2as a sum of 35harmonic 1More accurate potentials which better describe the actual PES can also be used. One example is the Morse potential for which exact analytical solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation are known [80]. 2Linearmoleculeshave 35vibrationaldegreesoffreedom. Allmoleculeshave 3degrees offreedombutinthelinearcasethereare3degreesoffreedomfortranslationandonly2forrotation, leaving 35vibrational degrees of freedom. Linear molecules only have 2 rotational degrees of freedom because they are symmetric about their internuclear axis. Non-linear molecules are not limited in this manner and have 3 rotational degrees of freedom.20 oscillator 35normal vibrational modes of the molecule to be treated separately. The solution to the quantum harmonic oscillator is known and the total vibrational wavefunction of the molecule is given by the product of the individual vibrational wavefunctions of each normal mode, =35\u00d6 =1,(). (2.15) The total vibrational energy is then given by the sum of the energy of each normal mode, =35 =1=35 =1\u0012 + 2\u0013 , (2.16) whereis the vibrational mode. In reality the vibrational potential is not perfectly harmonic and aharmonic terms must be added, which becomes especially important when dealing with larger vi- brations. These aharmonic terms mix the wavefunctions of the different normal modes so that the resulting eigenstates are linear combinations of the harmonic wavefunctions. The energies of the vibrational states are then and andare the angular momentum of the degenerate bending vibrations. Bending modes in linear polyatomic molecules In linear polyatomic molecules there are two types of vibrational modes: streching modes and bending modes. For example, the linear triatomic molecule YbOH has three vibrational modes: two stretching modes, the Yb-O and O-H stretch, and21 one bending mode, the molecule bending so the angle between the Yb-O and O-H bonds is smaller then 180. Unlike stretching modes, bending modes are doubly degenerate, one mode bending in the x,z-plane and the other in the y,z-plane (here the z-axis is the internuclear axis). In this case, the Hamiltonian for the bending vibrations can be represented as that of a the take the form (,)=()exp()wheremust take in- teger values [83]. Plugging this solution into the bending Schr\u00f6dinger equation (=) and integrating over results in a one-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger equation with an effective potential, , = 2\u0012 2+2 2\u0013 . (2.19) This effective potential corresponds to a harmonic oscillator with an angular mo- mentum barrier due to the rotation of the bent molecule about the internuclear axis. The projection of this rotational angular momentum along the internuclear axis is given by . This bending angular momentum must take on values of =,2,4,....,,whereisthequantaofthebendingvibration. Addition- ally, the solutions to Eq. values of zero ( ()=0) at=0[83]. Therefore, when there is bending angular momentum due to rota- tion,1, the molecule never assumes a linear configuration, 0, and instead resembles a bent molecule rotating about the \"former\" internuclear axis. Amoreintuitiveclassicalpictureofthebendingmodesandtheirassociatedangular momentumcanbegainedbyreturningtothepictureofdegeneratebendingmotions in the separate x,z and y,z-planes. Since these modes are degenerate any linear combination of them is also a solution. If these two x and y bends are combined with a 90phase difference it corresponds to a \"bent\" molecule orbiting around the \"former\" internuclear axis. This orbiting nuclei has an associated angular momentum which must be quantized along the internuclear axis in integer units of . The states with opposite values of (the parity eigenstates are actually the linear combinations1 2(|+\u00b1|))arenominallydegenerate. However,thisdegener-22 acy is broken by the end-over-end rotation of the molecule (Coriolis interactions). This is described in more detail in Section 2.7. The degeneracy between bending states of the same bending quanta, , but different values of , is broken by aharmonic terms in the vibrational Hamiltonian. Due to the additional angular momentum from the bending vibrations, it is con- vention to label bending vibronic states by the combination of the total electronic and vibrational angular momentum, = +. Then vibronic states are denoted by the term symbol2+1where=++is now the projection of the total angularmomentum ontheinternuclearaxis. CapitalGreeklettersarestillusedto denote the values of (,,,for=0,1,2,3). The degeneracy between the states of different in the same electronic state are broken by vibronic pertur- bations. Note that this can often lead to confusion as a molecule can be in a2 vibronicstate while in a2electronic state. This is the case for the lowest bending mode of the ground electronic state of YbOH. Vibronic Interactions: The Renner-Teller effect So far we have assumed that the motion of the nuclei, e.g., vibrations, does not affect the electronic configuration of the molecule. This approximation is good for molecules in electronic states with = 0or for stretching vibrations; however, it breaks down for degenerate electronic states with bending vibrations. Electronic stateswithnon-zeroprojectionsoforbitalangularmomentum, 1,aredegenerate due to the cylindrical symmetry of the linear molecule. When the molecule begins to bend, the cylindrical symmetry is broken and the bending induces an electric dipole moment which perturbs the electronic structure and mixes electronic states. This creates a coupling between the orbital and vibrational angular momenta, and, and breaks the degeneracy of the electronic state. This coupling is called the Renner-Teller effect and it can be included as a perturbation with the the bending vibrational angular momentum raising and lowering operators (see Ref. [84, 85] for the matrix elements), is the electron azumuthal angle,\u00b1acts as a raising and lowering operator for , and11and22quantify the strength of the coupling.

For example, in a state mixes in neighboring andelectronic states.

Inthecaseofalinearmolecule,themolecule can only rotate about a single axis, 4corresponding internuclear axis and each other. The cylindrical symmetry of the molecule makes these axes indistinguishable such that there is only one distinct rotation, end-over- endmotion. Alinearmoleculecannotrotateaboutitsaxisofsymmetrysincethemomentofinertia along this axis is zero.24 molecule. The rotational Hamiltonian, , is the kinetic energy due to the angular momentumofthisrotation. Theenergiesandwavefunctionsoftherotationalstates are found by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a quantum rigid rotor [81], =2 2J2=, (2.26) whereJis the angular momentum of the rotation and is the moment of inertia of the molecule about the rotational axis ( =\u00cd where the sum is over all nuclei ofmass,andisthedistancefromthecenterofmass). ThesolutiontoEq. 2.26 in spherical coordinates are the determined. Additionally, since changing molecular isotopologues changes both the center of mass and the masses of the nuclei, the rotational constant differs between different isotopologues of the same molecule and scales as 1/. 2.5 The effective Hamiltonian The BO approximation has allowed the separation of the molecular wavefunction into electronic, vibrational, and rotational parts. This is especially useful since the energies associated with these different interactions are orders of magnitude dif- ferent;104-105cm1for electronic states, 102-103cm1for vibrational states, and101-1 cm1for rotational states. High-resolution molecular spectra can re- solve spectral features separated by 10-100 MHz (much less than the rotational energy scale, noting that 1 cm130 GHz) and therefore interactions with energy scales equivalent or less than the rotational energies are relevant. Additionally, to adequately describe the energy levels of a molecule to the level needed to per- form precision measurements and laser cooling, the fine and hyperfine structure of molecule must be included. Therefore, most of the relevant molecular interactions25 occur at energy scales less than or equal to the rotational energy. When studying theseinteractions,itisoftenmostconvenienttoconstructaneffectiveHamiltonian, , that only operates in the subspace of a single vibronic state. This can be accomplished by considering all interactions with energy scales smaller than the vibrational energy as pertubations 5. The total Hamiltonian can then be written as [89], =0+1. (2.29) 0is the zeroth-order Hamiltonian that numbers for the state |0(the rotational, electronic spin and nuclear spin degrees of freedom). What we are interested in determining are the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian, |,, |,=(0 +,)|,. |,= , ,|,0. (2.32) We want to derive an effective Hamiltonian that only operates in the subspace of a single vibronic state, |0and returns the correct eigenvalues given by the total Hamiltonian. Therefore, the effective Hamiltonian will satisfy the following eigenvalue equation, () ,|,0=(0 +,) ,|,0. (2.33) If we define a projection operator = |,0,|0, (2.34) 5This section summarizes the derivation of given in ch. 7.2 of Ref.

Theeffectsof terms in 1that are off diagonal in (mix different vibronic states) are included in parameters in the effective Hamiltonian. To illustrate this we can derive the effective rotational Hamiltonian for a single electronic state. The rotational Hamiltonian is =R2=(NL)2=(N22 +L22 ++),(2.38) whereRis the angular momentum of the en-over-end rotation of the molecule ( J was used in Section 2.4 to better match the literature). As can be seen above, the operatorR2hastermsoffdiagonalwithrespecttotheelectronicstate(the +and +terms) and therefore the rotational Hamiltonian has been expressed in terms ofN=R+L6,thetotalangularmomentumminusspin.

TheL22 term is diagonal in the vibronic state and can be neglected as it simply adds to the zero-order Hamiltonian as a constant energy offset. We can now derive the form of the effective rotational Hamiltonian which operates in the subspace of a single vibronic state |by setting 1=in Eq. 2.36. To first ,= =||(N22 ++)||=(1)(N22 )(2.39) where (1)=||. (2.40) Note above that we have dropped the quantum numbers in kets since they define the basis we are projecting into, and we used the fact that for any operator that is diagonalinthespaceofvibronicstates(e.g., |O|=,)=. The second-order term in , as the R2formalism while describing the rotational Hamiltonian in terms of Nis known as the N2formalism. As to which formalism is more appropriate is up for debate. The R2formalism more accurately models the end- over-end rotation ( Ris the angular momentum of the end-over-end rotation) but requires evaluating matrix elements involving L. TheN2formalism avoids the matrix elements involving Lbut since the rotational Hamiltonian is described by N2it does not represent the end-over-end rotation as accuratelyasthe R2formalism. Eitherformalismwillaccuratelyrepresentandmodeltherotational spectra. Which formalism is used is generally only important if you are trying to reproduce the calculated rotational energy levels. For a more detailed discussion see Ref. [90]28 where (2)= |||\u00b1| . (2.43) Notice that (2) ,has the same form as (1) ,so we can write ,=(N22 ) (2.44) with =(1)+(2). (2.45) We have constructed an effective Hamiltionian, ,, which operates only within the vibronic subspace |that incorporates all the Thefirst-orderterm, (1),incorporatestheeffectsof thatoperateonlywithin |(e.g.,theend-over-endrotation)whilethesecond-orderterm, (2),incorporates the effects of mixing different vibronic states and projects them into the | subspace. Higher-ordertermscanbeincludedin andwillincludehigher-order mixingsofvibronicstates,howevertheeffectsofhigher-ordertermshaveasmaller and smaller effect on the eigenvalues of and therefore can be neglected. The operator 2 gives a value of 2+2in any vibronic state. Therefore, the term2 provides a constant offset to the initial energy of the vibronic state. Therefore, the effective rotational Hamiltonian can be expressed as, ,=N2. (2.46) The beauty of the effective Hamiltonian approach lies in the fact the energy levels of a vibronic state can be computed without diagonalizing the full Hamiltonian of the molecule. Therefore, to predict the spectrum for a single vibronic band, the energies and wavefunctions of each state can be calculated separately and then the transitions between each set of states computed. If you fit a measured spectrum to the calculated one, the parameters in the effective Hamiltonian can be determined. These parameters provide insight into each moleuclar state as well as other excited statesinthemolecule(throughhigher-ordercontributionstotheseparameters,such as(2)). In addition to rotation, fine and hyperfine terms are also included in the effective Hamiltionian, and the terms relevant for modeling YbOH and other molecules in doublet states are given in Sections 2.7 and 2.8. 2.6 Angular momentum coupling and Hund's cases When diagonalizing an effective Hamiltonian it is often best to choose a basis (the quantum numbers in |,0) in which is most diagonal. While can be29 diagonalizedinanybasis,choosingtheoneinwhich ismostdiagonalwillresult intheeigenfunctionsof havingalargeoverlapwiththebasisfunctions, |,0. The eigenfunctions closely resembling the basis function allow one to develop a goodintuitionforwhattheeigenstateslooklikeintermsofthebasisfunctions. The basis in which is most diagonal is determined by the relative strength of the interactionsin andhowtheseinteractionscoupletheangularmomentuminthe molecule. These angular momentum couplings are described by Hund's coupling cases [89]. There are five Hund's coupling cases but we will only describe the first two, as the molecular states of YbOH are best described by these two cases. First wewilldescribethecouplingcasesintheabsenceofhyperfinestructure(nonuclear spins) and then introduce the coupling cases in the presence of hyperfine structure. The relevant angular momenta and their projections on the internuclear axis , in the absence of nuclear spins, are shown in Table 2.1. Hund's case (a) For Hund's case (a) to provide a good description of the molecular state, two conditions must be met. First, the electron orbital angular momentum is strongly coupled to the internuclear axis and, second, that the electron spin Sis strongly coupled to Lvia spin orbit coupling (spin orbit coupling is discussed in Section 2.7). In this case LandSprecess rapidly about the internuclear axis so that their projections on the internuclear axis, andrespectively, are well defined [89]. The quantum number =+is also well defined. Additionally, if the molecule is in a bending state, couples to the bending angular momentum Gto give the quantum number =+.(orif=0) couples to the end-over-end rotation Rto give the total angular momentum J.

In addition to 9If the molecule contains more than one nuclear spin, following the coupling of Jto the first nuclearspin I1,denoted F1inthiscase,theintermediatequantumnumber Fwillsequentiallycouple to each nuclear spin, I+1, to give the final total angular momentum F. 10If there is another nuclear spin with which the hyperfine interactions are smaller, Gwill first coupleto NtogiveF1beforecouplingwiththeothernuclearspinstogivethetotalangularmomentum F.32 the molecular rotation, the other terms in the effective Hamiltonian generally fall into two classes: fine and hyperfine structure. This section will cover the fine structure terms which describe the interactions of the the electron spin with the other angular momenta (not including the nuclear spins) in the molecule. The effective Hamiltionian for the fine structure of the molecule is given by =++++. (2.51) The terms in are as follows; spin orbit, spin rotation, doubling,doubling, and centrifugal distortions. We will discuss each term in more detail below 11. Spin orbit The spin orbit interaction results from the coupling of the magnetic moment of the electronwiththemagneticfieldseenbytheelectronasitmovesthroughtheCoulomb field of the nucleus. This causes the electron spin Sto couple to the orbital angular momentum of the electron, L. Therefore, L\u00b7S=+1 2(+++) which has terms which mix electronic states that must be dealt with in a manner similar to how we dealt with the off-diagonal terms in the rotational Hamiltonian (see Ref. [89] for a derivation of the effective spin orbit Hamiltonian to second order). The effective spin orbit Hamiltonian takes the form [89] =, (2.52) where=(1)+(2)and(1)accountsforthefirst-ordertermsand (2)accountsfor the second-order terms that result from the mixing of electronic states. Definitions of(1)and(2)can be found in Eq. 7.109 and 7.120 in Ref. [89].

This separation of the 11We have not included the spin-spin interaction in the fine structure Hamiltonian as it is only non-zero for states with S1and we are constraining our discussion to doublet molecular states (S=1/2).33 differentcomponents of an electronic state is known as spin orbit splitting. Note that for an electronic state with = 0, the spin orbit interaction is not relevant as =0. At a fundamental level, the spin orbit interaction is a relativistic effect and therefore its strength increases with increasing atomic number. For molecules containing heavy nuclei, the spin orbit splitting can become so large the different spin orbit components are treated as separate electronic states. This is the case in YbOH. Spin rotation The spin rotation interaction accounts for the interaction of the electron's spin with the rotation of the molecule, N. The rotation of a linear molecule will generate a magnetic field (the nuclei are charged and therefore their rotation will generate a current)whichwillinteractwiththemagneticmomentoftheelectron.

Spin rotation in linear vibrational states ( =0) Foradiatomicmoleculeoralinearmoleculeinastatewith =0,rotationaboutthe internuclearaxisisnotpossible,resultingin results in rotaional angular momentum perpendicular to the internuclear axis such that =0. Taking this into account, the effective Hamiltonian for the spin rotation interaction in a linear different values of J(J=N+SandJ=NS) so that they are separated by an energy of (1/2+N). This splitting is known as spin rotation splitting. As with other parameters in the effective Hamiltonian, the spin However,thecontributionof (1)to is very small due to the very small magnetic moment generated by the orbiting nuclei. Therefore, the spin rotation parameter is dominated by the second-order contributionsgivenby (2). Thesecond-ordercontributionsarisefrominteractions of the off diagonal terms in the rotation and spin orbit Hamiltonians which, when projectedintothevibronicsubspace,resultinaneffectiveoperatoroftheform N\u00b7S.

This rotation about the internuclear axis also results in =20. In this case, the operator form of given in Eq. 2.55 does not correctly account for the rotation 12While using the functional form =N\u00b7Sfor the spin rotation interaction is correct for diatomic molecules and linear molecules in states with =0, sincecomponent of N\u00b7S is zero, it is incorrect for states with >0since=0, and the form of the spin rotation Hamiltonian given in Eq. 2.54 must be used.35 about the internuclear axis and Eq. 2.54 must be used. The form of Eq. 2.54 is easily understood. For the value of to be consistent with the linear definition (describing the coupling of Sto the end-over-end rotation), the contribution from the bending angular momentum, must be subtracted. However, this bending angularmomentumwillalsocoupleto Sandisaccountedforbythesecond term. For states with 1, the spin rotation interaction still creates an energy splitting between the J=N\u00b1Sstates, but now the spin rotation splitting is given by [91] =(2+1)\u0000(+1)2\u0001 2(+1)+(2+1)2 (+1). (2.57) The first-order contribution to is very small, again due to the small magnetic moment generated by the rotating nuclei. Therefore, for the term in Eq. 2.54 to make any significant contribution to the effective Hamiltonian, the second-order contributions to must be parity states1 2(|\u00b1|)and 1 2(|\u00b1|), are degenerate. However, the rotation of the molecule lifts this degeneracy and gives rise to parity doublets. An intuitive explanation of the origin of parity doubling can be found in Appendix A.4 of [47]. More technically, these paritydoubletsaregeneratedbysecond-orderinteractionsintheeffectiveHamilto- nian. If we expand the rotational Hamiltonian =N2=(JLGS)2, we find cross terms of the form J\u00b7LandJ\u00b7G. These terms are known as the Coriolis terms and are responsible for parity doubling. doubling The lifting of the degeneracy between the states1 2(|\u00b1|)is known as Lambda-doubling ( -doubling). As mentioned above, -doubling arises at sec- ond order in the effective Hamiltonian. More specifically, it is the result of a combination of off diagonal terms from the spin orbit and rotational Hamiltonians36 whichconnectstateswith |\u00b1tostateswith|throughthemixingwithother electronic states [89]. the electron \u00b1acts as a raising and lowering operatorforsothat=\u00b11|\u00b12|==1,andandquantifythestrength of the interaction due to the mixing with other electronic states. results from the mixing with other electronic states due to the combination of the spin orbit and rotational Hamiltonians, while results solely from mixing with other electronic states due to the rotational Hamiltonian. The expressions for andto second order can be found in Eq. (7.142) and (7.143) of [89]. l-doubling The lifting of degeneracy between the states1 2(|\u00b1|)is known as - doubling.-doubling arises in a similar fashion to -doubling with the only dif- ference being that the terms involve bending angular momentum Ginstead of the electronic orbital angular momentum L. Therefore, -doubling also only arises at second and higher orders in the effective Hamiltonian that cause mixing with other bendingvibrationalstates. Thisisduetothecombinationoftermsintherotational Hamiltonian and the analogous spin orbit interaction for the bending angular mo- mentum, G\u00b7S14,whichconnectstateswith |\u00b1tostateswith|. -doublinginteraction. 2and2 are directly analogous to their counterparts in have again dropped the term proportional to (2 +2+2 2) since it is only non-zero for states with S1.37 bond length. This increase in the bond length will increase the moment of inertia for the rotation and therefore decrease the effective rotational constant [81]. This effective bond lengthening will increase with increasing molecular rotation J. The effect of these centrifugal forces on the rotational Hamiltonian is called centrifugal distortion. The effective Hamiltonian for centrifugal distortion is given by [89, 92] =N2N2=N4, (2.62) whereis the centrifugal distortion parameter. The effect of is to change the energy of the rotational levels such that =(+1)((+1))2=((+1))(+1),(2.63) so that there is a corrected rotational constant of (+1). The magnitude ofis generally several orders of magnitude smaller than so that the effects of centrifugal distortions on the energies of lower rotational states are negligible. However,theinclusionof intheeffectiveHamiltonianisneededtoaccurately describe higher rotational states. Higher-order terms can also be added to account for higher-order corrections [81]. CentrifugaldistortionsalsoimpacttheotherinteractionsintheeffectiveHamiltonian as well. Take spin rotation for example. If centrifugal distortions change the energy of the molecular rotations then they will change how the spin couples to that rotation in a manner that scales with the rotational quantum number J. This centrifugalinteractionbetweenthespinrotationandtherotationisdescribedbythe spin Hamiltonian [93] =1 2[N\u00b7S,N2]+, and [,]+=+ , is the anticommutator. In general, any interaction described by a term in the effective Hamiltonian will have corrections due to centrifugal distortions. For an interaction described by an effective Hamiltionian of the form O=, the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for the centrifugal corrections is given by O=1 2[O,N2]+, (2.65) whereis the centrifugal correction to the parameter . In this manner, the centrifugal correction to the spin orbit (paramatarized by ) can be obtained by substituting O=in Eq. 2.65. Other interactions such as -doubling can be38 accounted for as well. Oftentimes, and especially for low-rotational states, these correctionswillnotmakeanysignificantormeasurablechangestotheenergylevels, and they do not need to be included in the effective Hamiltonian. 2.8 Hyperfine structure Ifthemoleculecontainsoneormorenucleiwithnon-zeronuclearspin, I,hyperfine interactions will be present. The hyperfine interactions describe the magnetic and electronic interactions of the nuclear, electric, and magnetic moments with other angular momenta present in the molecule. Here we will only consider the interac- tions due to the nuclear magnetic dipole and nuclear electric quadrupole moments. Theeffectsofhyperfineinteractionsaregenerallymuchsmallerthanthoseresulting fromthefinestructure,andthereforeitisusuallyonlynecessarytoincludethefirst- order contributions to the effective Hamiltionian. These are the only contributions we will discuss here. Magnetic dipole terms Themagneticdipoletermsdescribethemagneticinteractionsbetweenthemagnetic dipole of the nucleus and the other magnetic moments in the molecule. Several of theseinteractionsarisefrominteractionsbetweenthespinoftheelectronandthespin of the nucleus. These nuclear-electron spin-spin interactions are characterized by threetermsintheeffectiveHamiltonian: theFermicontact,dipole-dipolecoupling, and the parity-dependent dipole-dipole terms. The effective Fermi [89, 94] =I\u00b7S, (2.66) whereis and nuclear g-factors,andare the Bohr and nuclear magneton, sis the spin angular momentum of the th electron,()is the Dirac delta function, and(not used in Eq. 2.67 but will be used below) are polar coordinates, and the sum runs over all unpaired electrons. The Fermi contact interaction describes the magnetic contact interaction between the electron and nuclear spins arising from the overlap of the electron wavefunction with the nucleus (the ()in Eq. 2.67). Therefore, measurementsoftheFermicontactparameterprovideinformationabouthowmuch39 overlaptheelectronwavefunctionhaswiththenucleus. Comparisonofdetermined values to atomic values can provide experimental information on the atomic orbital composition of the MO.

The 2,;,| s(321) 3 |,;.(2.69) isagaindependentonthevalenceelectron'swavefunctionandthereforemeasure- ments of it provide information about the valence MOs. In Eq. 2.68 and 2.69, we only considered the terms from the magnetic dipole- dipole interaction which were diagonal in . There are also terms off-diagonal in , specifically those which connect states of | =\u00b11to states with| =116.

Therefore, if the state in question has a non-zero value of , the s+ (22) 3 |,=+1;,(2.71) wheres+ is the spin-raising operator for a single electron and is the azimuthal angle for the th electron. 16There are also terms which change by 1 and therefore would mix electronic state. These effects would only show up at second-order in the effective Hamiltonian and provide energy shifts muchbelowanymeasurablelimitsotheyaregenerallynotincluded. Thesesecondordertermsonly become measurable when there are nearly degenerate electronic states [94].40 Finally, if the molecular state has 1, there will be an additional magnetic hyperfineinteractiondescribingthemagneticdipoleinteractionbetweenthenuclear spinandthemagneticmomentgeneratedbytheorbitingelectron. Thisisanalogous to the spin orbit interaction. The effective Hamiltonian for the nuclear spin orbit interaction to first order 17is given by [94] =, (2.72) whereis the nuclear spin orbit parameter and is given one nucleus with non-zero spin. If the molecule contains multiple nuclei withnon-zerospinthentheaboveinteractionswitheachnucleusmustbeaccounted for separately. Therefore, if the molecule has nuclei, the total magnetic dipole hyperfine effective Hamiltonian is give by 18 dipole= +++. (2.74) Electric Quadrupole terms If a nucleus has a nuclear spin of I1then the nucleus could have an observable quadrupole moment, a non-spherical distribution of mass and charge so that the nucleus resembles an ellipsoid. This non-spherical charge distribution will result in the nucleus having an electric quadrupole moment. This electric quadrupole moment will interact with the electric field gradient created between the positively charged nucleus and the negativly charged electrons. This will lead to different orientationsofthequadrupoledeformednucleusintheelectricfieldgradienthaving different energies. Since the orientation of the nucleus is given by the orientation of the nuclear spin, this will result in an interaction that is dependent on both the nuclear spin orientation and the magnitude of the electric field gradient. The effective Hamiltonian that describes this electric quadrupole interaction is [89] 0=20(3I2) 4(21), (2.75) 17Technically =I\u00b7Lbut, just as with the spin orbit interaction, the effective operator is given by only the elements diagonal in ,. 18Wehavenotincludedthenuclearspinrotation(analogoustofinestructurespinrotation)terms in the effective dipole hyperfine Hamiltonian as they are not relevant for describing the structure of YbOH.

Aswiththedipolarinterac- tions, the terms which mix states with =\u00b11will cause electronic states to mix and will only become relevant at higher order. These terms are not included in the effective Hamiltionian. The off diagonal terms which connect states with =\u00b12 are included in the non-axial 6 =\u00b12,=\u00b11|2 ()|,=1, (2.78) wherenowthe 2 =\u00b12()arethe=\u00b12componentsofthesecond-rankspherical tensor describing the electric field gradient. 2has the selection rules = 0 and = 2and therefore will only connect states with = 2. Therefore, in a 2state, 2will only connect states from different spin orbit components, the = 1/2and= 3/2states. 2.9 Molecular transitions It is not possible to directly observe the energy levels of a molecule but only the transitions between two molecular states. These transitions are driven by the inter- actionofelectromagneticradiation(photons)andthemolecule. Thesephotonscan directly interact with either the electrons to cause the electron to change states or thedipolemomentofthemoleculeitself. Theformerinducesrovibronictransitions 19An overview of spherical tensors including there relation to the Cartesian operators can be found in Ch. 5 of Ref. [89].42 (atransitionsbetweendifferentrovibronicstates)whilethelatterinducesrotational transitions within a single vibronic state. By observing either the absorption or emission of photons when these transitions are driven, we can determine the tran- sition frequencies and ultimately the energies of the states involved. In addition to providing a means to observe and measure molecules, molecular transitions can also be utilized to control and manipulate molecules (laser cooling, coherent state preparation, etc.). We are interested in understanding electric dipole transitions 20, how the electric dipoleoperator(firstterminthemultipoleexpansionoftheelectricfieldofthelaser or microwaves) connects two different molecular states. For two given molecular states, the transition intensity or strength is given by the expectation value of the electric dipole operator, , between the two states =||||2.

Vibrational transitions Ifweonlyconsidervibronictransitions(e.g.,thelaserisbroadenoughthattransitions from many rotational/fine/hyperfine states are excited at once so that the rotational, fine and hyperfine structure is unresolved) then the intensity is given by [81] =|,||,|2=|||||2=, , 2,(2.80) where here we use andto describe the electronic vibrational wavefuctions respectively, and we have used the spectroscopic notation of the double prime and prime reffering to the ground and excited states respectively.

For the set of differentvibrationaltransitionsbetweentwoelectronicstates, ,isconstantand the relative transition intensities are only dependent on the FCFs. Following excitation to an excited state |,the molecule will decay back down to the ground state (or some other lower state). The probability that the molecule willdecaytoa the frequency of the transitions from |,to|,. Therefore the probability of a vibrational decay is dependent on the FCF. This fact becomes important when laser cooling molecules. Vibrational selection rules Whether or not a vibrational transition is allowed is determined by ,. From Eq. 2.81 we know that ,=0if the product is odd with respect to the originofthecoordinatesystem. Thisoccurswhenoneofthewavefunctionsiseven and the other is odd. For a linear molecule, all stretching mode wavefunctions are evenwithrespecttotheoriginandthereforenothinginherentlypreventsvibrational transitionsbetweendifferentstretchingmodes. However,forbendingvibrationsthe situationisdifferent. Allbendingwavefunctionswithoddvaluesof areoddwhile even values of are even. This results in the following vibrational selection rules for linear molecules: =0and therefore =0,\u00b12,\u00b14,...More intuitively, this can be though of in the following way. Since the photon only interacts with the valence electron's charge or the molecule's dipole moment, it can not cause a change in the bending angular momentum (similar to how a photon can't change thespin),and =0. Foramorerigorousdescriptionofvibrationalselectionrules with respect to the molecular symmetry, see Ref. [81, 82]. It is important to note that forbidden 0transitions due occur and are due to mixing from vibronic perturbations such as the Renner-Teller effect. For example consider the case of a2+(=1)21/2(=0)transition which is normallyforbidden. Vibronicandspinorbitinteractionscanmixthe21/2(= 0)state with the bending mode of an excited state so that the true wavefunction of the21/2(=0)state is now =|21/2(=0+|2(=1). The2+(=1)2(=1)transitions is not forbidden which will now44 allow the2+(=1)21/2(=0)to occur via intensity borrowing.

Anexampleofa2+2 transitions with the branch designations is shown in Fig. 2.2. 2.10 Overview of laser cooling molecules Nowthatwehaveintroducedgeneralmolecularstructurewewilltakeaslightaside to give a brief overview of laser cooling molecules. For a more thorough and complete discussion of molecular laser cooling and trapping see [98, 99].45 Lasercoolingofatomsandmoleculesisaccomplishedbyutilizingtheinteractionof theatomormoleculewithlaserlighttoexertforcesontheatomormolecule. When a laser's frequency is resonant with an atomic or molecular transition, the atom or moleculewillabsorbaphotonandtransitiontoanexcitedstate. Thisabsorptionwill provideamomentumkickof inthedirectionofthelaserpropagation. Theatom or molecule will then decay from the excited state emitting a photon. This process of photon absorption and emission is known as photon scattering. Upon decay, the emitted photon has no preferred propagation direction. Therefore, after many photon scatters, the momentum transfer from each photon emission will cancel, on average, resulting in each photon scatter providing an average momentum kick of in the direction of the laser propagation. Therefore, if an atom or molecule of massmoves with velocity then the atom or molecule can be brought to a stop after=/photon scatters. In general, to laser cool and trap an atom or molecule,about10,000photonscattersareneeded. Thisrepeatedprocessofphoton absorption and emission is referred to a photon cycling. In order to actually cool and trap an atom or molecule, it must contain a closed cycling transition so that thousands to millions of photons can be scattered. By closed,wemeanthatuponexcitation,theatomormoleculewillnotdecaytoastate unaddressed by the laser and stop scattering photons. While finding closed cycling transitions in certain atoms is fairly easy, it is much more difficult in molecules due to the addition of vibrational and rotational branching. The strict angular momentum and parity selection rules for rotational transitions can be utilized to providerotationalclosure[100]. Fora2+21/2transition,thisisaccomplished bydrivingtransitionsfromthenegativeparity =1statetotheevenparity =1/2 state(the12(1)and11(1)transitionsinFig. 2.2). Theangularmomentumand parity selection rules enforce that a =1/2positive parity state can only decay to =1/2,3/2negative parity states. There are no =3/2negative parity states in a 2+electronic state so the molecule will always decay back to the original =1, =1/2,3/2states, providing rotational closure. Thelackofstrictselectionrulesforvibrational transitionsmakesaddressingvibra- tional branching much more difficult. From Eq. 2.82 we know that the vibrational branching is proportional to the FCF. Therefore, if we choose a molecule with diagonal FCFs ( ,1for=), then the branching to higher vibrational modes not addressed by the cooling lasers will be small. In this case only a small, experimentally feasible, number of repumping laser will be needed to optically46 pump the population in these higher vibrational states back into the cooling cycle. Diagonal FCFs are achieved when the vibrational wavefunctions of the ground and excitedstateareverysimilar,whichoccurswhenthegroundandexcitedstatePESs are almost nearly identical. This occurs when the valence electron involved in the optical cycling is decoupled from the bonding electrons.

Prior to the development of experiments to search for a NMQM and eEDM in YbOH, a single spectroscopic study of YbOH had been performed using a high-temperature sample [105]. This study found that YbOHisindeedsimilartothealkalineearthhydroxides(CaOHandSrOH),alinear molecule with a ground 2+electronic state and a first exited 21/2state. Here wehaveintroducedthespectroscopicnotationwherethegroundstateisdenotedby anand all other excited states are denoted by capital letters in alphabetical order, first excited is , second excited is , etc. 21Additionally, this study confirmed that YbOH has a very large spin orbit splitting in the 2state,=1350cm1, so that the 21/2and 23/2states are separated by 1350 21/2and 23/2statesareconsideredtobeseparateelectronicstatesratherthan differentspinorbitcomponentsofthesameelectronicstate. Thisoriginalstudydid containanerrorwhichresultedinanincorrectvalueforthespinrotationparameter. Thecorrectvalueofthespinrotationparameterwasdeterminedaspartofthework described in this dissertation, resulted in a reanalysis of the high-temperature study [106]. The state ordering (not to scale) of the first few rotational levels of the 2+(0,0,0)and 21/2(0,0,0)states of YbOH is presented in Fig. 2.2. YbOH is a linear triatomic molecule and will have three vibrational modes: Yb-O stretch 1, Vibra- tional states are indicated in parentheses (1,2,3)following the electronic state designations. Similar to CaOH and SrOH, the strong ionic bond between the Yb and OH provides very diagonal FCFs making YbOH amenable to laser cooling. 21Sometimes the state labeling is out of order when lower excited states are experimentally observed after =state residing higher in energy than the =+state. Similarly, the negative value of the (+2)parameter in the 21/2(0,0,0)state reverses the ordering of the parity components compared to similar alkaline earth metal fluorides and hydroxides.

The vibrational branching ratios of YbOH have been measured to high precision [107]. The vibrational branching from the 21/2(0,0,0)state (for branching ra- tios0.01%) are presented in Fig. 2.3. In addition to diagonal FCFs, the bending modeofthegroundelectronicstate, 2+(0,1,0),willhaveparitydoubletsdueto the-doubling. This parity doubling can be used for internal comagnetometry and, therefore, the 2+(0,1,0)state will act as the science state for both the NMQM and eEDM measurements.

YbOHisafreeradical(moleculewithanunpairedvalence electron) and is not chemically stable. Therefore, we must use production methods thatwillavoidthelossofYbOHthroughchemicalreactions. Furthermore,atroom temperature a sample of molecules will typically occupy thousands of different rotational and vibrational states so we must also cool the molecules to cryogenic temperatures where the thermal distribution of molecules is spread over only a few rotational levels. We accomplish the production and cooling of the molecules with cryogenic buffer gas cooling and ultimately extract the molecules to form a cryogenic buffer gas beam (CBGB). In this chapter I provide a brief review of CBGBs (more complete and thorough reviews and studies can be found in [108- 112])andadescriptionofour4KCBGBsource,includingthedesign,construction, and characterization. 3.1 Cryogenic buffer gas beams Cryogenic buffer gas cooling At the heart of any CBGB source is buffer gas cooling. Buffer gas cooling utilizes elastic collisions with a cold, inert buffer gas, typically helium or neon, to cool the molecularspeciesofinterest. Inpracticethisisaccomplishedinsideofacryogenic buffer gas cell: a small volume, typically 10-50 cm3, which is cooled to cryogenic temperatures, typically 1-10 K 1. The buffer gas cell is filled with the buffer gas, in ourcaseHelium,whichisthermalizedtothecelltemperaturethroughcollisionswith the cell walls. The molecular species of interest can be introduced into the cell via laser ablation, capillary filling, or other methods [108]. Following the introduction of the molecular species, collisions with the cold buffer gas will quickly cool the rotational, and translational degrees of freedom of the molecules to near that of the buffer gas 2. 1These temperature are typical for a helium buffer gas, neon sources run hotter 20K. 2The vibrational quenching collisional cross section for buffer gas collisions is typically much smaller than the rotational quenching cross section [71] and therefore buffer gas cooling may not efficientlycoolthevibrationaldegreesoffreedomresultinginanathermalvibrationalpopulation. It isknownthatthisathermalvibrationalpopulationalsooccursinsupersonicmolecularbeamsources.50 Buffer gas cooling relies on collisions, and therefore, is a generic method that can be applied to almost any molecule. More importantly, the buffer gas is inert which makes this technique especially attractive for free radicals such as YbOH. Buffer gas cooling will result in a molecular sample cooled to a few Kelvin where the molecules will occupy only a few tens of internal states, an ideal starting point for both spectroscopy and experiments requiring specific quantum state control (e.g. lasercoolingorparityviolationsearches). Buffergascoolinghasbeenusedtocool atoms and small [109] and large molecules [113]. Cryogenic buffer gas beam properties A cryogenic buffer gas molecular beam can be formed by putting an aperture, typically 1-5 mm, in the cell and applying an constant buffer gas flow, typically 1-100 SCCM 3. The buffer gas flow into the cell must equal the flow out of the aperture and therefore the buffer gas density in the cell is dependent on both the buffer gas flow and the size of the aperture [108]: 4 0,, (3.1) whereis the buffer gas inlet flow, is the area of the aperture, and 0,is the meanthermalvelocityofthebuffergas. Thehigherthisdensity,themorecollisions per unit time which results in quicker thermalization. Notonlywillthecollisionswiththebuffergascoolthemoleculesbutitwillentrain them into the buffer gas flow and extract them from the cell to form a molecular beam with high extraction efficiency [108, 114]. The extraction of the molecules follows an exponential decay with a time scale given by [108] =4 0,(3.2) whereis the cell volume. This extraction time needs to be slower than the thermalization time, so that the molecules can be cooled before they are extracted, but quicker than the time it takes for the molecules to diffuse to the cell walls. Buffer gas beams are often operated in an intermediate regime where the buffer gas density is high enough that there are a significant number of collisions such that the gas flow cannot be described by molecular flow (e.g. effusive beam) but not high enough (or dense enough) to be described by hydrodynamics either. The 3SCCM or standard cubic centimeters per minute is a standard unit of gas flow. 1 SCCM is equivalent to4.5\u00d71017atoms per second.51 output velocity of the CBGB is highly sensitive to how close to the effusive or hydrodynamic regimes the CBGB operates. We can quantify this using a quantity called the Reynolds number, . In the case of a CBGB it is most important to consider the Reynolds number at the aperture, where it is approximately equal to twice the number of collisions that occur within an aperture diameter away from the aperture [108]. Since is proportional to the number of collisions near the aperture,itdirectlytellsindicatesinwhichregimethebuffergassourceisoperating. In terms of the CBGB properties, the Reynolds number is given by 8 2 0,, (3.3) the aperture. this case the beam's forward velocity, (here we refer to the velocity of the species of interest not the buffer gas) is given by 1.20,, (3.4) where0,is the mean thermal velocity of the species of interest. In the low end of the intermediate regime, 110, there are now collisions with the buffer gas near the aperture. These collisions will speed up the beam. In this regime, the beam's forward velocity can be approximated by 1.20,+0.60, , (3.5) whereandare the mass of the buffer gas and molecular species of interest respectively. As gets higher there are more collisions near the aperture which will cause additional boosting of the beam velocity. At very high ,100, thebuffergasflowisalmostfullyhydrodynamicandresultsinafullyboostedbeam with a forward velocity of 1.40,. (3.6) For intermediate higher than that described by Eq. 3.5 but lower than the fully hydrodynamic regime, 10100, the CBGB forward beam velocity is better described by 1.40, 14/5. (3.7)52 Notice that the beam velocity given in Eq. 3.7 saturates to the fully hydrodynamic value. CBGBsourcesaremostoftenoperatedintheintermediateregime, 1 100where the forward beam velocity is best described by Eq. 3.5 and 3.7. It is often advantageous to produce the slowest molecular beam possible. This is especially true for laser cooling as slower beams will make slowing and stopping the molecular beam easier. Many techniques have been used to accomplish this, including second stage cells and cooling the buffer gas cell to colder temperatures [111]. These techniques were not used in this work so they will not be discussed further. 3.2 4 K cryogenic buffer gas beam source AtthecenterofwhatwillbecometheNMQMexperimentisthe4KCBGBsource. A description of this source is provided here, including the design principles and lessonslearned. Muchofthissystemwascustomdesignedandfabricated. Manyof the spectroscopic measurements detailed in this dissertation were measured using this 4 K CBGB source. TocooltocryogenictemperaturesweutilizedaCryomechPT415pulsetuberefrig- erator, referred to as the pulse tube. The pulse tube has two stages, the first stage coolingto40K,referredtoasthe50Kstage,andthesecondwhichcoolsto 3.5 K,referredtoasthe4Kstage. Thepulsetube,andallothercryogeniccomponents, are mounted in a custom aluminum 14.5 inch x 14.5 inch x 24.5 inch rectangular vacuum chamber, referred to as the 300 K chamber. This chamber has removable side,top,andbottomplates. Thevacuumsealsbetweentheplatesandthechamber are made using Viton o-rings. All o-ring seals in the 4 K CBGB source are made with Viton o-rings; Buna is avoided due to higher outgassing rates. When the pulse tube is mounted directly to the top of the 300 K chamber, the 4 K stage of the pulse tube rests near the bottom of the chamber. In order to maximize the usable space and provide a beam output near the center of the 300 K chamber, the pulse tube was mounted higher in the 300 K chamber. This was accomplished bymountingthepulsetubetoacustom2.0-inch-thickoctagon-shapedcollarwhich was in turn mounted to a custom 8.0-inch-diameter 7.315-inch-long nipple. This nipple was mounted to the top of the 300 K chamber (a drawing of the octagon- shapedcollarandcustomnipplecanbefoundinAppendixB).Theoctagon-shaped collar wasused to ofthe 300 chamber'stopplate,whichisthesamemountingpatternusedforthecustomnipple.53 All vacuum seals were made with Viton o-rings.

A three dimensional CAD drawing of the full 4 K CBGB assembly (excluding the buffer gas cell) is shown in Fig. 3.1, including the mounting of the pulse tube using the octagon collar and custom nipple.

Radiation shields Theinnerwallsofthe300Kchamberwillradiate300Kblackbodyradiation(BBR) intotheinsideofthechamber. Mountingthecryogenicbuffergascelldirectlyinside of the 300 K chamber, with no thermal shielding, will expose the cell to this large 300 K BBR heat load and prevent the cell from cooling down to 4 K. In order to reducetheheatloadonthecellitissurroundedwithnested50Kand4Kradiation shields (connected to the 50 K and 4 K stages of the pulse tube respectively). In this configuration only the 50 K shields are exposed to the 300 K BBR while the 4 K shields are exposed to 50 K BBR and the cell is exposed to 4 K BBR. The lower 4 K heat load on the cell results in a lower operating temperature. It is important54 to note that while the 4 K shields reduce the BBR heat load, their existence does not significantly lower the temperature of the cell, as the cell and the 4 K shields are cooled by the same stage of the pulse tube. The 4 K shields, however, act as a cold surface on which the cryopumping charcoal sorbs (to be discussed later) can bemounted.

The50Ktopplaterestsonapairoflockednutsthreadedontothesethreaded 4The threaded rods are screwed directly into the top plate of the 300 K chamber and are not vented. Technically, this creates trapped volumes which are typically avoided in vacuum chambers. However, since the 50 K and 4 K surfaces act as gigantic cryopumps, and we will be purposefully flowing helium into the chamber, the gas load from these trapped volumes is negligible. 5Stainlesssteelthreadedrodswereusedsincestainlesssteelhasrelativelypoorthermalconduc-55 rods,thisallowstheheightofthe50Kstagetobeadjusted. Theserodscanbeseen in Fig. 3.4 and 3.5. The 50 K bottom plate is 0.25 inches thick and has a grid of 10-32 tapped holes. A temperature diode is attached to the bottom plate for monitoring the temperature of the 50 K stage. The 50 K top and bottom plates are connected by 0.5 inch x 0.5 inch x 16.0 inch rectangular connecting bars (vertical connecting bars). The bars have tapped holes in the center of the ends, which are used to fasten to the top and bottom plates. The sides of the connecting bars have a single line of 10-32 tapped holes (thru all), separated by 1.0 inch and offset by 0.5 inches on adjacent sides to prevent the holes from intersecting. These holes are used for fastening the side plates. Additional connecting bars (horizontal connecting bars) are mounted to the innersidesofthetopandbottomplatestoprovideadditionalpointsforfasteningthe side plates. The frame of the 50 K shields, comprised of the connecting bars and thetopandbottomplates,canbeseeninFig. 3.2 a. Notethatintheoriginaldesign thenutsonwhichthetopplaterestscontacttheverticalconnectingbars. Thesides of the connecting bars had to be filed down to prevent this. The 11 inch x 16 inch side plates are too large to fit through the side of the 300 K chamber so they were separated into two separate plates. First is the larger (50 K sideflange)11inchx16inchplatewitha8.5inchx13.0inchrectangularholeoffset 0.5 inches below the center. The second plate (50 K side cover plate) is 9.5 inch x 14.0 inch plate which is attached to the 50 K side flange to cover the rectangular hole. The smaller plate fits through the side flange in the 300 K chamber allowing the inside of the 50 K stage to be accessed through the side flange of the 300 K chamber. Access to the 4 K shields with the 300 K front plate and 50 K front side cover plate removed is shown in Fig. 3.3. Both side plates are 0.25 inches thick.

Detailed description of the labeled parts is given in the text. a.)Outer silver (Aluminum 6061) and inner orange (Copper C10100) parts are the 50 K and 4 K frames respectively.

Copper 101 was chosen as it provides the best thermal conduction 6\"Copper 101\" or \"Copper C101\" is not a defined alloy, and different vendors unfortunately use this to mean either C10100 or C11000, the latter of which is more commonly known as C110. In57 at 4 K. The 4 K shields form a 8.2 inch x 8.2 inch x 11 inch box. The design of the 4Kshieldsisnearlythesameasthatofthe50Kshields. Aswiththe50Kshields, the 4 K top and bottom plates are connected with vertical connecting bars and the sideplatesarefastenedtothesidesofthesebarsaswellastohorizontalconnecting bars mounted to the inside of the top and bottom plates (shown in Fig. 3.2). The 4 K top plate is 0.5 inches thick and is oversized to 10 inches x 10 inches so that it hangs over the sides of the 4 K shields 7. This provides more room for connections withthe4Kstageofthepulsetubetobemade. Aswiththe50Kshields,thereare four 1.0 inch diameter holes for gas lines and electrical wires to be passed through. The 4 K top plate is suspended by threaded rods attached to the 50 K top plate, shown in Fig. 3.5. The 4 K top plate also has a grid of tapped holes for mounting. However, due to the soft and gummy nature of copper, all tapped holes for the 4 K stage have stainless steel helicoil inserts to prevent damage to the threads from repeated fastening and unfastening. The4Kbottomandsideplatesareall0.125inchesthick. Eachsideplatehasa4.5 inchx4.5inchsquareholeinthecenter.

As with the 50 K collimator, the0.25-inchholehasaconicalcounterboreonthefront. Inordertoimprovebeam quality, this collimater was eventually replaced by a skimmer. This is discussed in more detail in Section 3.2. The inner walls of the 4 K shields are coated with activatedcharcoal(sorb),showninFig. 3.2,3.13,and3.14. Thesesorbsdrastically increase the cryopumping capacity of the CBGB, allowing the background Helium to be efficiently pumped away. However, the sorbs eventually fill up and have to be periodically emptied by heating up the 4 K stage to 12-15 K and letting the desorbedHeliumbemechanicallypumpedaway. Asideandfrontviewofthefully assembled 4 K shields is shown in Fig. 3.3. Drawings of all of the components of the 4 K shields can be found in Appendix B. this dissertation I will use Copper 101 to refer to C10100. 7The corners of the 4 K top plate had to be filed off as they contacted the 50 K shields.58 Figure 3.3: Fully assembled 4 K shields. a.)Side view of the 4 K shields. Here the 4 K shields are in the assembled 50 K shields with the 50 K side flange and 50 Ksidecoverplateremoved. b.)Frontviewofassembled4Kshields. Herethe4K collimator can be seen. This is where the CBGB passes out of the source and into thebeamregion. Thisviewisshownwiththe300Ksideplateand50Ksidecover plate removed, illustrating how the design allows the internal portion of the CBGB source to be accessed with minimal disassembly. Thermal connections with pulse tube refrigerator While the top plate of the 4 K shields sits right below the 4 K stage of the pulse tube, allowing easy connections, the 50 K stage of the pulse tube resides inside of the custom nipple, above the top plate of the 300 K chamber. In order to thermally anchor the 50 K shields to the 50 K stage, a thermally conductive surface must extend down through the custom nipple from the 50 K stage to near the 50 K top plate. Thisisaccomplishedwithwhatwecallthe50Khexagonalextender. The50 K hexagonal extender is comprised of seven parts, all fabricated from Copper 101. Again, all tapped holes have stainless steel helicoil thread inserts installed. The first piece is the 50 K hexagonal thermal plate, which is a 0.5-inch-thick hexagonal shaped plate which attaches directly to the 50 K stage of the pulse tube. The top of six 2.0 inch x 5.86 inch x 0.5 inch bars (50 K extender bars) is attached directly to the 50 K hexagonal thermal plate so that they hang vertically down to provide thermal contact with the 50 K top plate.

Here, the mounting of the 50 K hexagonal extender to the 50 K stage of the pulse tub is shown. This was before the pulse tube was mounted with the custom nipple. In the final configuration the 50 K stage and the top of the 50 K hexagonal extender reside in the custom nipple above the 300 K top plate. Even though the 4 K stage sits just above the 4 K top plate, an adaptor plate (4 K thermal plate) to make thermal connections was used. The uses of the 4 K thermal plate were twofold: first, to provide more surface area with which thermal connections could be made and second, to prevent direct damage to the threaded holesonthe4Kstageofthepulsetube. The4Kthermalplatewasfabricatedfrom Copper101andalltappedholeshavestainlesssteelhelicoilthreadinsertsinstalled. The plate is 6.0 inches x 6.0 inches and 0.5 inches thick. A drawing of the 4 K thermal plate can be found in Appendix B. Where the 4 K thermal plate sits with respect to the 50 K and 4 K top plates is shown in Fig. 3.5 (this can also bee seen in the CAD drawing in Fig. 3.1). When thermally anchoring the shields to the pulse tube, it is important that the connectionsprovidegoodthermalcontactbutarenotmechanicallyrigid.

Whenassemblingordisassemblingtheradiation shields, torques that could damage the pulse tube can be both purposefully and inadvertently applied. Therefore, thermally conductive yet mechanically non-rigid connections between the radiation shields and the pulse tube are needed to protect the pulse tube from damage.

Allcellpartsarefabricatedfrom Copper 101 and all tapped holes have stainless steel helicoil thread inserts. The modular cell pieces are created by machining a 0.5-inch-diameter cylindrical hole through the center of at 1.5 inch x 1.5 inch copper bar of varying lengths. All cell pieceshavefour4-40clearanceholesonthecornersofa1.0inchx1.0inchsquare and parallel to the boar of the cell. These 4-40 holes are used to connect the cell62 pieces. The body of the cell is formed by two different types of modular cell pieces. First are blank cell pieces which are comprised of the 0.5-inch hole that forms the cell. All sides of the blank pieces have a grid of 4-40 tapped holes. The blank sections provide surface area with which thermal and mechanical connections can be made. The blank cell pieces vary in length from 0.25 inches to 1.0 inch in 0.25-inch increments. A 0.5-inch blank cell piece is shown in Fig. 3.7 a. a.) b.)c.)

The helium enters the cell 0.125 inches before this plate on the center line of the plate. The arc-shaped slots function to push the helium flow towards the outside of the cell so that the helium is more evenly distributed over the cell volume. The second type of cell piece is a window cell piece. Compared to the blank cell pieces,thewindowcellpieceshaveanadditionalcylindricalholecutperpendicular to the cell bore and completely through the entire piece (referred to as the window port). Window cell pieces come in three lengths, 0.5 inch, 0.75 inch, and 1.0 inch. The diameter of the window ports are 0.25 inch, 0.5 inch, and 0.75 inch for the 0.5-inch,0.75-inch,and1.0-inchwindowpiecesrespectively. Fourtappedholesare63 alsoaddedparalleltothewindowportformountingwindowstothecell. Examples of a 0.5-inch and 0.75-inch window pieces are shown in Fig. 3.7 b. A window flange is used to fasten a window to the cell. Before the window is compressed between the flange and the side of the window cell piece, both the side of the window cell and the flange are coated in several layers of kapton tape. Borosilicate glass windows were used. Mounted windows can be seen in Fig. 3.8. The window cell pieces provide optical access to the interior of the cell for laser ablation, cell diagnostics, or spectroscopy. The section of the cell used for laser ablation has the window extended from the side of the window cell piece by a snorkel. This allows the window through which theablationlaserpassestobefurtherremovedfromtheablationtargetstopreventit from becoming coated with ablation products. The snorkel is made by brazing two flangestotheendsofacoppertube. ThesnorkelisshowninFig. 3.8 d. Eventhough the snorkel helps the ablation window from becoming coated it does not prevent it completely, and the ablation window (and other windows) need to be changed periodically. Opposite the snorkel the targets are mounted to the cell in place of a window. This is accomplished by attaching the targets to a blank window flange (target plate) with stycast epoxy before attaching the flange to the cell. Initially we usedAluminum6061forthetargetplatesbuthaveswitchedtoCopper101forbetter thermal conduction. The helium is introduced into the cell through the gas inlet. The gas inlet is made by brazing a 0.125-inch Copper 101 tube to a blank 0.25-inch cell piece which has a 0.125-inch hole instead of the normal 0.5-inch cell bore. The back of a gas inlet plate is shown in Fig. 3.8 c. Though it was not initially used, a diffuser plate was added to the back of the cell. This plate has arc-shaped slots cut in it which act to disperse the helium flow more evenly throughout the cell volume. A CAD drawing the the diffuser plate is shown in Fig. 3.7 c. The diffuser plate is separated from the gas inlet by a 0.125-inch blank cell piece. Unless otherwise stated the cell aperture is a 5-mm-diameter circular hole.

The first cell assembly, shown in Fig. 3.8 a,b, andc, was comprised of (in order): gas inlet, 0.5-inch blank, 0.75-inch window piece for ablation, 0.5-inch blank, 0.5- inch window piece for diagnostics, and 0.25-inch aperture.

A piping and instrumentation diagram of the helium gas manifold is shown in Fig.66 3.10. The helium is sourced from a gas cylinder and the pressure is stepped down andregulatedwithapressureregulator. Followingthepressureregulator,isamass flow controller (MFC), with a range of 0-10 SCCM, which controls the flow of helium provided to the cell. There is a hand valve 9after the MFC which allows the helium gas manifold to be isolated from the CBGB source. After this hand valve, the helium enters the 300 K vacuum chamber through a fluid feedthrough. Before reachingthebuffergascelltheheliumpassesthrougha50Kand4Kheatexchanger which are thermally anchored to the 50 K and 4 K top plates respectively. These heat exchangers cool the helium to 50 K and then 4 K before it reaches the buffer gas cell. This reduces the heat load on the cell and makes the buffer gas cooling more efficient. The heat exchangers are made by coiling copper 101 tube around a copper 101 rod and brazing the outside of the tubing to the rod. The 50 K and 4 K heat exchangers are shown in Fig. 3.6 aand Fig. 3.6 brespectively.

TheheliumisprovidedbytheHecylinderand the pressure in the manifold is regulated by a pressure regulator. The helium flow rate is controlled by the mass flow controller. The 50 K and 4 K heat exchangers cool the helium before it reaches the buffer gas cell. The pump out port is used to pump out or leak check the gas manifold. After the pressure regulator, all connections are made using Swagelok VCR metal face seal gaskets and fittings and all of the components are \"all metal.\" Prior to the 50 K heat exchanger and between the 50 K and 4 K heat exchangers, stainless steel 9Swagelok SS4BKV31 bellows sealed valve.67 tubing is used.

After the 4 K heat exchanger only copper 101 tubing is used. Beam extension and vacuum system After the buffer gas beam is skimmed and collimated by the skimmers in the front of the 4 K and 50 K shields, it exits the CBGB source through a KF 50 port in the 300 K chamber and enters a room-temperature vacuum region called the beam extension. Except for a custom ordered 10-way KF 50 cross, the beam extension is comprised of off the shelf KF and CF vacuum components. Again, all o-ring sealsaremadeusingonlyvitono-rings. Amanuallyoperatedgatevalveisattached directlytotheKF50portofthe300Kvacuumchamber. Thisgatevalveallowsthe beam extension to be isolated from the CBGB source. The beam extension region allows optical access to the CBGB with which beam diagnostics or spectroscopic measurements can be made or state preparation or spin precession tests performed. InthefinalNMQMexperiment,thebeamextensionwillconnecttoorbereplacedby theNMQMsciencechamberinwhichtheNMQMmeasurementwillbeperformed. Originally, the custom 10-way KF 50 cross followed the gate valve and provided optical access. More recently, a 6-way KF 50 cross was inserted between the gate valve and the 10-way cross to provide a second region with optical access. AR- coated KF 40 windows (from AccuGlass) are attached to the KF crosses via KF 40 nipples and adaptors. More recently, the two windows on the 10-way cross (which provide laser access perpendicular to the CBGB) have been replaced by custom Brewster angle windows. The entire interior surface of all KF components (both crosses, all nipples, and all adaptors) is coated with air-brushed Alion MH2200 black paint to reduce laser scatter. A light pipe is attached to the top port of the 10-way cross for light collection and a metal mirror was recently mounted below thelightpipetoreflectdownwardemittedmolecularfluorescencebackintothelight pipe. A KF 50 window is mounted on the top port of the 6-way cross for light collection.

Pressure gauges are mounted directly to both the CBGB source (an Instrutech convectron) and the 10-way cross (a MKS multi-ion gague). When operating with both the CBGB source and beam extension under vacuum hand valve 1 (see Fig. 3.11) is closed so that the system is pumped through the beam extension. When this valve was not closed we observed iceformationinthesourceduetobackflowthroughtheIDP-10scrollpump. Further upgrades to the vacuum system have been made and are discussed in Section 3.2 below.69 Background gas issues and solutions WhileoptimizingtheCBGBsourcetoperformspectroscopyofweakYbOHbands, we observed that the magnitude of the laser induced fluorescence (LIF) signal decreased with increasing buffer gas flow. This indicated that we had a buildup of background gas in our system that was attenuating the molecular beam. The backgroundgasbuildupcouldbeoccurringinanyorallofthefolowingregions;in the 4 K shields, in the space between the 4 K and 50 K shields or 50 K shields and 300K chamber, or in the beam extension. We solved the issue by increasing both the mechanical and cryopumping capacity of the system. Mechanicalpumpingcapacitywasincreasedwiththeadditionoftwoturbopumps.

Inordertoincreasethepumping rateneartheCBGBoutputandnearthespacebetweentheradiationshieldsandthe 300 K chamber, an additional TwisTorr 74FS turbo pump was added to the front plateofthe300Kchamber. Thisturbopumpwasmounteddirectlyabovethebeam output. Manual valves are placed in the system so that this 74FS turbo pump can pump on the CBGB source even when the beam extension is isolated and open to atmosphere. All turbo pumps are backed by the same IDP 10 scroll pump. The cryopumping capacity of the CBGB source was increased with the addition of more activated charcoal sorbs. The additional sorbs were added in the form of vertical sorb plates, 0.125-inch-thick copper 101 plates coated with activated charcoalonbothsides. Theseverticalsorbplatesaremountedtothesidesofsquare copper bars (sorb bars) which are mounted to the inside of the 4 K bottom plate. TheverticalsorbplatesandmountingbarsareshowninFig. 3.14. Drawingsofthe vertical sorb plates and sorb bars can be found in Appendix B. When making the upgrades, we discovered that the sorb on the 4 K skimmer plate hadbecomecoatedwithdebris,showninFig. 3.13. Thispromptedthereplacement of the 4 K skimmer plate with a conical skimmer. The conical skimmer is shown in Fig. 3.14 b. The conical skimmer acts to both skim the beam and reflect any background gas away from the output of the buffer gas cell.70 CBGB source Gate valveKF 10 way crossHand valve 1 Hand valve 2Hand valve 3 Hand valve 4 IDP 10 scroll pumpTwisTorr 84FS turbo pumpPressure gauge 2Pressure gauge 6 way crossTwisTorr 74FS turbo pump TwisTorr 304FS turbo pump Hand valve 6 Figure 3.12: Diagram of upgraded vacuum system for CBGB source and beam extension.

Comparedtothevacuumsystemin Fig. 3.11, the CBGB source is now pumped both through the beam extension and directly by the 74FS turbo pump. The beam extension also has additional pumping from the 304 FS tubo pump. Closing the gate valve and hand valve 3 isolates the beam extension from the CBGB source while still pumping the CBGB source with the 74FS turbo pump. Closing hand valve 5 and opening hand valve 1 will pump the CBGB source with the IDP 10 directly, bypassing the 74 FS turbo pump. Hand valves 2 and 4 operate just as they did in Fig. 3.11. An additional vent/leak check portwasadded(notlabeled),isolatedbyhandvalve6,sothattheCBGBsourceand the beam extension can be leak checked separately. 3.3 Diagnostics: Absorption and fluorescence Allbeamdiagnosticsandspectroscopicmeasurementsareperformedviaeitherab- sorptionorlaser-inducedfluorescence(LIF).Weperformabsorptionmeasurements in and in front of the buffer gas cell and LIF measurements in the beam extension.

When a laser beam passes through a gas of molecules or atoms, the molecules or atoms will absorb photons from the laser if the laser frequency is resonant with a71 Figure 3.13: Debris in activated charcoal sorb of 4 K skimmer plate. transition in the atom or molecule. This will cause the intensity, or power, of the laser beam to be attenuated. In the limit of low intensity (e.g., saturation <1), this attenuation is given by the Beer-Lambert law [115], =0()(), (3.8) whereis the transmitted power, 0is initial power incident on the molecu- lar/atomic cloud, ()is the absorption cross section, ()is the number density of molecules/atoms per unit area, and is the interaction length of the laser with the molecular/atomic cloud. The absorption cross section, (), depends on the frequency of the laser and this frequency dependence is the absorption line shape. The number density of molecules/atoms per unit area, (), is dependent on time due to the pulsed nature of the CBGB source. By measuring 0and, we can determine the optical depth (OD) (,)=0 =()(), (3.9) and the integrated OD ()= ()=() (). (3.10) Measuring the frequency dependence of results in a measurement of the absorptionspectrumofthemolecules/atoms.

(3.11) Therefore, a measurement of the integrated OD can also be used to determine the total number of molecules/atoms interacting with the laser beam.

Thislaser-inducedfluorescence(LIF)canbedetectedusingaPMT.Themagnitude of the LIF is proportional to the number of molecules/atoms that absorb a photon initially,(), and, therefore, measuring the frequency dependence of the LIF providesameasurementofthespectrumofthemoleculeoratom. Additionally,LIF can be used to measure the Doppler shift of molecular or atomic transitions due to the velocity of the molecular/atomic CBGB. This provides accurate measurements of the CBGB velocity and velocity distribution. When dealing with molecules, the decay can occur to multiple vibrational states (see Section 2.9) and filters can be used to obtain background free detection of off-diagonal transitions.73 Photodiodes Ablation laser Target 6-way cross10-way cross Figure 3.15: Simple diagram of the optical setup (not to scale).

This is accomplished by focusing a doubled, pulsed Nd:YAG laser (532 nm) 10onto a pressed powder target (Yb foil for the case of Yb atoms). The high- intensity laser light vaporizes the surface of the target and forms a plasma. YbOH molecules are formed in the plasma and then cooled via collisions with the buffer gas. We typically ablate with pulse energies in the range of 10-50 mJ/pulse (most oftenoperatingnear30mJ/pulse)andrepetitionratesfrom4-10Hz. Alensisused to focus the ablation laser, with the focal point overlapping with the target location. We find that angling this lens can improve the molecular yield from the ablation.

The targets are madebymixingvariousratiosofYbpowderwithotherpowderedcompoundswhich containoxygenandhydrogen. Thetarget-makingprocedureisasfollows 11. Firstthe powderedcompounds(theYbpowderandothercompoundscontainingoxygenand hydrogen, such as Yb(OH) 3) are mixed and ground with a mortar and pestle until theypassthrougha230meshsieve. Thepowdermixtureisthencombinedwith4% polyethylene glycol (PEG8000, often referred to simply as PEG) by weight, which acts as a binder. Several targets containing Te(OH) 6used KF as a binder instead of PEG 12. The mixture is then pressed in an 8-mm die at 10 MPa for15 minutes. Thedyecomponentsarecoatedindry-molylubricantpriortopressing. Asummary ofthetargetsmadeandtestedduringtheworkdescribedinthisdissertationisgiven in Table 3.1. The quality of a target is assessed using two metrics: overall yield, and how fast (numberofablationshots)theYbOHproductiondecreasesordecays. Thesequan- tities are measured using in-cell OD is proportionaltothetotalnumberofmoleculescreatedineachpulse,thereforemon- itoring the OD as a function of number of ablation shots provides a measurement of the total yield and the decay. Tests comparing the integrated OD vs number of ablation shots for tested, the stoichiomet- ric Yb + Yb(OH) 3target had a significantly higher yield for the first few hundred ablation shots. However, the YbOH yield (integrated OD) from the stoichiometric Yb + Yb(OH) contrasttothestoichiometricYb+Yb(OH) 3targettheyieldfromthetwoTe(OH) 6 + Yb+ KF targets decayed at a much slower rate, essentially providing relatively constant integrated ODs over the range of ablation shot numbers tested. When operating the CBGB source decay in the YbOH signals is compensated for by adjusting the ablation laser so that it hits a fresh spot on the target, reviving the signal. The consistency and lack of decay from the Te(OH) 6+ Yb+ KF targets prompted us to use KF targets tested here in spectroscopic 11This procedure was taught to us by Elizebeth West. 12These targets were made in coordination with Richard Mawhorter and Graceson Aufderheide.75 Table 3.1: Summary of YbOH Stoichiometric mixture refers to equal ratio of Yb to O to H by num- ber. PVOH is polyvinyl alcohol. These target recipes were determined by Graceson Aufderheide. studies. Unfortunately,otherbatchesofTe(OH) 6+Yb+KFtargetsperformedmuch more poorly, and we abandoned the Te(OH) 6+ Yb+ KF targets due to this lack of reproducibility from target to target. On the other hand, the stoichiometric Yb + Yb(OH) 3targets produce large amounts of YbOH and the performance is very consistent from target to target. Additionally, when testing the other target compo- sitions and recipes listed in Table 3.1, we found that all other recipes performed, at best, equivalently but often worse than the stoichiometric Yb + Yb(OH) 3targets. ThestoichiometricYb+Yb(OH) 3targetshavebecomeourstandardaswehavenot found any targets that perform better. The parameter space of both mixture ratios and OH-containing compounds has76 only been minimally explored by the set of targets given in Table 3.1. It is very possible that a target composition and recipe which produces targets which surpass the stoichiometric Yb + Yb(OH) 3targets in performance exists. Therefore, further testing of different target compositions and recipes is warranted. Additionally, production procedures which differ or expand upon the simple grind and press procedure used here could very well produce targets with better properties. All the targets described here suffer from the fact that they are relatively soft and powdery compared to sintered or metal targets. Experimental efforts have shown that harder, denser, and more homogeneous targets tend to ablate better (higher yield, more consistent, less decay) 13. Unfortunately, sintering is not beneficial for YbOH targets, as the OH bond tends to dissociate at temperatures lower than those needed to cause the target structure to reorganize into a denser more solid form. However, other production methods besides sintering may be able to create denser, harder, and more homogeneous YbOH targets. 3.5 Testing cell with mesh aperture In addition to the initial testing of the CBGB source, we experimented with a new cell aperture made from copper mesh. This section describes the testing of this aperture. Note that, outside of this section, the data described in this dissertation was taken with a different aperture which consisted of a 5-mm-diameter hole in a solid copper plate. Though copper mesh had been used for second-stage cell apertures [111], to our knowledge, it had not been used to make an aperture for a single stage buffer gas cell. The aperture was made by punching a 3/16th-inch hole in the center of a 1.5 inch x 1.5 inch square of copper 101 size 80 mesh. 4-40 clearance holes were also punched in the mesh so that it can be mounted using the 4-40threadedrods. Infrontofthemesh,a0.25-inch-thickmeshholderwasplaced toclampdownthecoppermesh. AfrontviewofthemeshapertureisshowninFig. 3.16. The cell assembly used with the mesh aperture is as follows (in order from gas inlet to aperture); gas inlet, 0.5 inch blank, 1.0 inch window with snorkel, 0.5 inch blank, 0.5 inch window, mesh aperture, 0.25 inch mesh holder. Experimentation with the mesh aperture resulted from our hypothesis that an aper- ture of this type may be able to provide a more effusive and therefore slower beam. Thecoppermeshwouldprovideasemi-transparentendtothecellwhichhelium(and the species of interest) would be both reflected from and flow through. The partial reflection of the helium should keep the helium density in the cell high enough so 13For example, solid metals like Yb generally ablate better than the pressed powder targets.77 Figure 3.16: Mesh aperture. The aperture consists of a 3/16th-inch-diameter hole in copper 101 size 80 mesh. The darker circle surrounding the aperture hole is the cylindrical bore of the buffer gas cell. that adequate thermalization can occur while providing the helium an alternative path (other than the aperture) to flow out of the cell. With a normal aperture, all the helium must exit the cell through the aperture. This causes the helium density near the aperture to increase, causing more collision near the aperture to occur. This results in boosting. The semi-transparent nature of the mesh aperture should, in theory, allow the helium to flow out through it while still directing some out of the open aperture. The alternative flow path through the mesh should lower the heliumdensityandthenumberofcollisionsneartheaperturecomparedtoanormal aperture. Less collisions near the aperture will result in a lower and a more effusive, slower beam. Testing of the cell with the mesh aperture and the resulting CBGB properties was performed with Yb atoms. CBGB properties (see Section 3.1) depend on either the buffer gas properties (mass, thermal velocities, etc.) or the ratio of the mass of the buffer gas to that of the species of interest, /. For Yb and YbOH, //and therefore a Yb and YbOH CBGB will have essentially78 the same properties.

Thismaybeduetothefactthatthemeshprovidesalternativeflowpaths outofthecellthattheatoms(ormolecules)maymorereadilypassthroughathigher buffer gas flow rates. It is possible that this maximum in extraction was not seen at an ablation energy of 4.2 mJ/pulse as the total number of extracted molecules was always below the maximum reached at 6.2 mJ/pulse. However, this explanation is speculativeandmoreextractiondataatbothhigherflowratesandablationenergies79 Figure 3.17: Number of atoms in front of cell aperture vs buffer gas flow rate at ablationlaserpulseenergiesof4.2and6.2mJ/pulse.

Beam velocity CBGBvelocitymeasurementswereobtainedviaLIFmeasurementsoftheDoppler shift of the1011atomic Yb transition. All velocity measurements were obtained with an ablation pulse energy of 3.4 mJ/pulse and performed in the beam extension region, 43.7 cm downstream from the cell.

The two-dimensional colormap provides a more full picture of the CBGB velocity. The solid black curve in Fig. 3.19 is the time-of-flight curve, the time at which an atom/molecule leaving the buffer gas cell with velocity at time =0(the ablation time) should reach the detection region 47.3 cm downstream. Integrating Fig. 3.19 over the time axis results in the LIF vs velocity data shown in Fig. 3.18b. To understand the effect of the buffer gas flow rate on the CBGB velocity, velocity measurementsatlower(1SCCM)andhigher(6SCCM)flowrateswereperformed. A two-dimensional colormap of the longitudinal LIF as a function of time and velocity at a 6 SCCM buffer gas flow rate is shown in Fig. 3.20. A Gaussian fit to the LIF vs velocity data resulted in a measured forward velocity at 6 SCCM of 106.7\u00b11.4m/s and a forward velocity spread of 22.8\u00b11.8m/s. The transverse velocity data resulted in a measured transverse velocity spread of 13.2\u00b10.8m/s.

With the onset of our experiments, Timothy Steimle and his group at ASU remeasured these bands at high resolution using a cold sample derived from a supersonic molecular beam source [116]. The PPMODR spectroscopy of the 2+(0,0,0)state, described here, supplemented the re-characterization of these bands as the microwave mea- surements allowed the parameters of 2+(0,0,0)state to be determined to much higherprecisionthancouldbeachievedwithopticalmeasurements. ThisPPMODR study also resolved the YbOH proton hyperfine splitting for the first time. The 21/2(0,0,0)2+(0,0,0)origin band is the main cycling transition used in the laser cooling of YbOH and also often used for molecular detection when char- acterizing CBGB performance. The work described in this chapter was published in [93]. 4.1 Pump Probe Microwave Optical Double Resonance (PPMODR) spec- troscopy PPMODR spectroscopy combines the high resolution of microwave measurements with the efficiency of optical detection. Here we used PPMODR spectroscopy to record the pure rotational spectrum of the 2+(0,0,0)state of174YbOH. The measurementsdescribedherewereperformedinthelaboratoryofTimothySteimle at ASU. A simplified diagram of the PPMODR experimental setup and method is shown in Fig. 4.1. This work utilized a supersonic YbOH molecular beam, gen- erated using laser ablation as described in previous PPMODR studies [117, 118]. Following ablation, molecular originating from therotational level of the 2+(0,0,0)ground state (Fig. 4.1 b). The pump laser will optically pump population out of the rotational state. Following the pumpbeam,themoleculesareexposedtomicrowaveradiation(Fig. 4.1 c). Finally, the molecular beam is measured with a weak ( 5 mW) probe beam, resonant with the same 21/2(0,0,0)2+(0,0,0)rotational transition as the pump beam, and the resulting LIF is detected with a PMT (Fig. 4.1 d). When the microwave radiation is resonant with the rotational transition in the 2+(0,0,0) state, molecular population will be transferred from intoand there will be an increase in the monitored LIF signal. By measuring the LIF as a function of themicrowavefrequency,rotationaltransitionsterminatinginthe rotationalstate are measured. Different pump/probe transitions will allow the measurement of ro- tationaltransitionsterminatingindifferent rotationalstates. Thismethodavoids theradiativebroadeningoftheexcitedstatesasitmapspopulationfromonestateto another using narrow microwave transitions. The optical excitations are used only forstatepreparationandreadoutand,therefore,thehighresolutionprovidedbythe microwave transitions is preserved. The pump/probe laser beams were generated from the same cw-dye laser, ensuring theyareatexactlythesamefrequency. Themicrowaveradiationwasgeneratedusing a 0-20 GHz synthesizer and active harmonic multipliers. A rubidium standard was utilized as the time base for the synthesizer. Approximately 1 W of microwave radiation was introduced into the chamber with a homemade 26\"H-plane\" horn antenna. Microwavepowersabove1 Wresultedinbroadeningofthespectrallines. The frequency of the the microwave radiation was stepped in increments of 6 kHz and,theLIFfrom600ablationshotswassummedateachfrequencystep. TheLIF from excitation of the 2+(0,0,0) 21/2(0,0,0)transition was detected on resonance using photon counting techniques. In principal, PPMODR spectroscopy is a background-free technique if 100% pumping efficiency is achieved. 4.2 Microwave spectrum of the 2+(0,0,0)state Observation and analysis Rotational transitions terminating in the =+spin rotation components were detected using pump/probe light resonant with the 11branch features of the 2+(0,0,0) 21/2(0,0,0)transition while rotational transitions ter- minating in the =spin rotation component were detected with the pump/probe laser resonant with the 12or12branch features [116].

If a rotational transition in the 2+(0,0,0)state is driven by the microwave radiation it will result in an increase in the measured LIF. PPMODR technique, 12 rotational lines were measured and assigned to 18 ro- tational transition frequencies.

The measured transition frequencies and the associated quantum number assignments for the transitions can be found in Table A.1 in Appendix A. The energy levels of the 2+(0,0,0)state of YbOH were modeled using the89 Figure 4.2: PPMODR spectral feature and associated energy levels the overlapped=5,=11/2,=5=6,=13/2,=6and =5,=11/2,=6=6,=13/2,=7pure rotational tran- sitions in the 2+(0,0,0)ground state of YbOH. This figure was prepared by Timothy Steimle and is from Ref. centrifugal distortion ( and), and the Fermi contact () and dipole-dipole ( ) magnetic hyperfine interactions due to the proton in the H atom. The energy levels were calculated by constructing and diagonalizing a 4x4 Hamiltonian 1in a case (a ) basis. The matrix elements for the terms in were taken from Ref. [89, 92]. The eigenvalues and the measured transition frequencieswereinputintoanon-linearleastsquaresfittingalgorithmtodetermine the parameters ( ,,, ,,and) of the 2+(0,0,0)state. The results of the fit are presented in Table 4.1. The fit residuals (observed-calculated transition frequencies) are presented in Table A.1 in Appendix A. The standard deviation of the fit was 23 kHz which is commensurate with the measurement error. 1The effective Hamiltonian is block diagonal in and therefore can be split into 4x4 blocks.90 Results and discussion The optimal spectroscopic parameters for the 2+(0,0,0)state of YbOH deter- mined in this PPMODR study are given in Table 4.1. Also presented in Table 4.1 are the previous values from the high-temperature study [105] and the equivalent parameters for the ) parameters are similar to those determined in the previous high-temperature study but more precise. If we assume that the O-H bond length isthesameasitisinBaOH, 0.9270 ,[120]therotationalconstantmeasuredhere gives a Yb-O bond length of 2.0397 . This is extreamly similar to the Yb-F bond 2.0165 for the isoelectronic molecule174YbF 4.1: from thePPMODRmeasurements. Alsopresentedforcomparisonarethepreviousvalues from the higher-temperature study of YbOH and Ref. [119]. This table was reproduced from [93]. WhiletherotationalparametersbetweenthisPPMODRstudyandthehigh-temperature analysis are in good agreement, the determined spin rotation parameters, , have a large discrepancy ( 81.150(57)MHz vs 28.90(42)MHz). The value for de- termined from the PPMODR spectra is not only about three times larger than the91 value determined with the high-temperature sample but it is also of the opposite sign. Thislargediscrepancypromptedare-analysisofthehigh-temperaturedataby the original authors [106] in which a re-assignment of the 11and12branches of the174YbOH and172YbOH high-temperature data produced a negative value of consistentwiththevaluemeasuredinthisPPMODRstudy. Thenegativevalueof and a comparison with YbF is discussed in detail in Section 4.3 below. Finally, the high-resolution provided by the PPMODR technique allowed the mag- netic hyperfine parameters due to the hydrogen to The measured valuesof()(4.80(18)MHz)and()(2.46(48)MHz)areverysmallandsim- ilartothosemeasuredforthe 2+(0,0,0)stateofSrOH, ()=1.713(2)MHz () and()for YbOH are over an order of magnitude smaller than the equivalent values for the isoelectronic molecule YbF (here the magnetic hyperfine is due to the F instead of H). The smaller hyperfine splittings in YbOH were expected and result from the spin polarization of two bonds (as oppposed to one in YbF). This essentially results in the hydrogen residing further from the Yb-centered valence electron. ThesmallhyperfinesplittingduetotheHwasnotobservedintheoptical spectrumofYbOH[116]. Thissmallhyperfinesplittingindicatesthatthehyperfine components will not need to be individually addressed when optically cycling on the21/2(0,0,0)2+(0,0,0)transition. 4.3 Negative spin rotation parameter and perturbing states As discussed in Section 2.7, the spin rotation parameter, , is dominated by second-order effects, (2). These second-order effects arise from the mixing of the2+(0,0,0)statewithotherexcitedvibronicstatesthroughthecombinationof therotationalandspinorbitinteractions. Therefore,eventhoughweonlymeasured rotationaltransitionsinthe 2+(0,0,0)groundstate,thedeterminedspinrotation parameter can provide a significant amount of insight into the excited electronic statesofYbOH.Forthe 2+(0,0,0)groundstate=0,thereforethesecondterm in Eq. 2.56 is zero and the second-order contribution to arises solely from the mixing with excited2states. In this case, the dominate contribution to is given by [89, 122], (2)=2 2,|||22+ 1/2||21/221/2|\u00cd + |2+ 1/2 ,,,(4.2)92 where sum is taken over all excited2states and all vibrational levels, , of each excited2state. Here, is the level the2+state. the singleelectron angular momentumand spin respectively and the sum is taken over all electrons. Inthealkalineearthmono-halides(e.g.,CaF)theobservedspin-rotationparameter, , of the2+state can be quantitatively predicted using Eq. 4.2 and the known electronicstatedistribution. Specifically, (2+)forCaF(=0.0131cm1)isread- ily predicted by including only the 2+21/2interactions in Eq. 4.2 [123]. Like YbOH alkaline earth mono- halidesareatomicinnatureandcanbewellapproximatedbylinearcombinationof atomic orbitals. Therefore, if the distributions and FCFs for YbOH arereasonablywellknown, canbeestimatedusingEq. 4.2andtheknownatomic parameters of the Yb+ion. When comparing the determined value of YbOH (and YbF) with that of the alkilineearthmono-halides,themoststrikingdifferenceisthatitisofoppositesign, negative as opposed to positive. The negative value of determined in this study indicatesthatYbOHhasotherinteractingexcited2states. Wecanseethisbyfirst considering the contributions to (2)that arise from the 21/2state. The ground state of YbOH has a valence electron configuration given by 2+:[]4141 +(66). (4.3) Here we have only considered the Yb-centered electrons and neglected the valence configuration of the OHradical as it acts as a closed shell and does not contribute tomatrixelementsinEq. 4.2. The []414termindicatesthattheYb+ionhasthe samefilledelectronconfigurationasXesurroundedbyafilled 414shell.1 +(66) indicates that YbOH has a single unpaired electron in a orbital comprised of a combination of theYb+6and6hybrid atomic orbitals. Thewavefunction of the 2+state can then be approximated by 2 |2+|6+|6, (4.4) where|6=|=6,=0,=0and|6=|=6,=1,=0(is the projection of on the internuclear axis) are the Yb+6and6atomic orbitals. 2We have neglected contributions from the Yb+5and413orbitals as the contributions should be small.93 Measurements of the hyperfine parameters of the odd isotopologues (see Section 5.5) indicate that||20.54. Assuming contributions from other atomic orbitals (e.g., 5) are small,<1%, gives||20.46. The configuration for the 21/2state is given by 2:[]4141 +(65), (4.5) where here1 +(65)indicates a single unpaired electron in a orbital comprised of a combination of the Yb 6and5hybrid atomic orbitals. The wavefunction of where|6=|=6,=1,=1and|5=|=5,=2,=1are the Yb+ atomic 6and5orbitals. If as,\u00b7[124]andusetheYb+atomicionvalues, 6=2220cm1and5=549 cm1[125],aswellasthemeasuredspinorbitparameterofthe 2stateofYbOH, =1350cm1[105], we estimate||20.48and||20.52. We can use the electronic wavfunctions given in Eq. 4.4 and 4.6 and the pure precession hypothesis [89] \u00b1|,,= (+1)(\u00b11)|,,\u00b11 (4.7) to determine the matrix elements of Eq. 4.2. Note that the \u00b1operator will only connect atomic states with ==0and=1. Therefore, the =\u00cd and+ operators will only result in non-zero matrix elements between the |6 and|6components of the |2+and|21/2wavefunctions. Therefore, the matrix elements in Eq. 4.2 for the Yb-O stretching mode and94 the measured bond lengths 3of the 2+and 21/2states. We have neglected the FCFs involving the bending and O-H streching modes as they are extremely small. Usingthemeasuredvalues,theharmonicapproximationgivesthefollowing FCFs:|=0|=0|2=0.8723,|=0|=1|2=0.1123,|=0|= 2|2=0.0138,|=0|=3|2=0.0014, and|=0|=1|2=0.001. FCFs from higher vibrational states were not included as they are extremely small. In theharmonicapproximation,theenergiesofthe 21/2statearegivenby 2,= 0(21/2)+(21/2). Using these FCFs, energies, and the matrix elements given in Eq. 4.8 and 4.9 results in the following value for the contribution to the spin rotation parameter from the 21/2state (21/2)=+0.0276cm1=+828MHz. (4.10) Contributions to from the 21/2state are only positive and cannot account for the negative value of . Therefore, interactions with additional2states must be contributing to the sum in Eq. 4.2. More specifically, the additional2states +(66) orbital. It is reasonable to assume states of this nature exist in YbOH as there are similar states in the Yb+ion (e.g., the2 7/2and2 5/2states derived from the[]41362configurations [126]). the following electron configuration: []4132 +(66). (4.11) It is convenient to think about this 413configuration as a single hole (e.g. Only the2state will contribute to(2)and we will write this electron configuration in the following way: (413)2:[]1+ +(4)2 a hole in the Yb 4orbital. Since the charge of the hole is opposite of the electron, it will result in a negative value of in the spin orbit interaction 4. Therefore, states derived from the electron configuration given in Eq. 4.12 result in negative contributions to (2). Therefore, the only way to account for thenegativevalueof determinedinthisworkistheexistenceof2statesinYbOH which contain contributions from the electron configuration given in Eq. 4.12. We refer to the states resulting from a Yb 413configuration as perturbing states. Additionally, the negative value of also indicates that the negative contributions fromtheperturbingstatesoutweighthosefromthe 21/2orotherexcited2states. The isoelectronic molecule YbF also has a negative spin rotation parameter in the 2+(=0)ground state [119], and it was concluded that this is also the result of 413perturbingstates[122,124]. However,thevalueof forYbFisapproximately 6timessmallerthanthatofYbOH.Thisindicatesthattheperturbingstatesprovide a larger contribution to in do in YbF. 4ThisisobservedintheYb+atomicionenergylevels,the2 7/2stateislowerinenergythanthe 2 5/2state, e.g.,4+1<0.96 C h a pte r 5 Spectroscopy of Odd Isotopologues,171,173YbOH This chapter details both the development of enhanced YbOH production via laser-enhanced chemical reactions and the observation, assignment, and analysis of the 21/2(0,0,0)2+(0,0,0)band of171YbOH and173YbOH.

A simultaneous measurement and analysis of the171YbOH and 173YbOH spectra provided a systematic check of the analytical methods since the measured magnetic hyperfine parameters scale by the magnetic moments of each respectivenuclei. Finally,measurementsofthespectralfeaturesoftheoddisotopo- logues proved extremely difficult due to the complex, overlapping structure of all the YbOH isotopologues. In order to simplify the otherwise overlapped spectra, a novel spectroscopic technique utilizing the laser-enhanced chemical reactions was developed and utilized. The development of the increased YbOH production via laser-enhanced chemical reactions is published in Ref. [128] and the spectroscopic studies of171,173YbOH are published in Ref. [129]. Some portions of the material published in Ref. [129] are reproduced here with permission from AIP. 5.1 Laser-enhanced chemical reactions: Enhancement of YbOH production Gas-phaseYbOHcreatedbyablationofasolidprecursorisbelievedtobeproduced primarily in the high-temperature created by ablation. Collisions with the buffergascoolthisplasmaresultinginaquenchingofthechemicalreactionsasthe reactantscooltocryogenictemperatures. InadditiontoYbOH,theablationprocess also produces atomic Yb (orders of magnitude more than YbOH), indicating that unused reactants are still present in the buffer gas cell following the cooling of the ablation produced plasma. Chemical reactions of ground state (10) Yb atoms with many reactants, such as H 2O, are endothermic at cryogenic temperature and thereforedonotproceedinthebuffergascell. However,excitationoftheYbatoms to an excited electronic state can provide exothermic reaction pathways through97 which YbOH production can proceed. Studies of excited state chemistry have shown that reactants in excited states have access to additional reaction pathways and transition states [130] and can result in modified product state distributions [131]. Laser excitation of reactants has also been used to produce the molecular species of interest in spectroscopic studies [132, 133]. We find that excitation of the3110atomic Yb transition results in a factor of10increase of the number of YbOH molecules both inside the buffer gas cell and in the CBGB. Unless otherwise stated, all data was collected when driving the 3110transition of transition [116], directly of the =2 rotationallevelofthe 2+(0,0,0)state. Withtheenhancementlightblocked,there is an un-enhanced yield of 4\u00d71010molecules in the cell and 7\u00d7109molecules in front of the cell. With the enhancement light unblocked there is an enhanced yield of3\u00d71011moleculesinthecelland 8\u00d71010moleculesinfrontofthecell. Inboth cases,incellandinfrontofcell,thenumberofmoleculesisincreasedbyafactorof 10. This enhancement is dependent on the geometry in which the enhancement laser is introduced into the cell. We found that the largest enhancement in YbOH production occurs when the enhancment light is introduced thought the absorption probewindow,asopposedtodownthecellborethroughtheapertureorthroughthe ablation window attached to the snorkel. Tocharacterizetheenhancedproductionwedefineaquantitycalledtheenhancement factor,theratiooftheintegratedODwiththeenhancementlightonandoff. Thisratio oftheintegratedODsisequaltotheratioofthenumberofYbOHmoleculeswithand without the enhancement light. We observe that the frequency dependence of the enhancementfactorfollowsthatofanatomicresonance. Theenhancementfactoris maximizedwhentheenhancementlaserisonresonancewiththe3110atomic Yb transition and decreases exponentially when the enhancement laser is detuned from the atomic resonance. For large detunings from the atomic resonance, the enhancement factor reaches a value of 1 (same amount of YbOH with and without the enhancement light), indicating that the off resonant light does not increase YbOHproduction. Thepowerdependenceoftheenhancementfactoralsoindicates98 that the enhanced YbOH production is due to driving an optical resonance. The enhancement factor increases linearly for low powers and saturates at high powers, with the crossover occurring for an intensity of 10W/cm2. This saturation indicates that the enhancement is proportional to the excited31Yb population. The resonant nature of the enhancement factor allows specific selection of which YbOH isotopologue has enhanced production: driving the3110transition of one Yb only 1enhances the production of that isotopologue of YbOH 2. For the odd isotope/isotopologue173Yb/173YbOH, we investigated the effect of driving different hyperfine components of the1031173Yb transition on the enhancement factor. The enhancement factor for both the =2and=3 (=+see Section 2.6) hyperfine states of173YbOH when driving each of the three (=5/2=3/2,5/2,7/2)173Yb transitions is shown in Fig. 5.1. The enhancement factor for the =2and=3states of173YbOH were probed through absorption spectroscopy of This overlap will result in excitation of both171Yb and173Yb to the31 state which will allow production of171YbOH as well. The increased171YbOH production will deplete the available population of reactions with which173YbOH can be formed.

When detuning the Yb excitation light off of the174Yb transition and toward the172Yb transition, the cross enhancement decreases and eventually disappears. Therefore, the cross 1We see some cross enhancement between YbOH isotopologues, discussed below. 2For example driving the1031174Yb transition enhances the production of174YbOH while driving the1031172Yb transition enhances the production of172YbOH. 3Here the branch designations are given by1().

Instead the cross enhancement is proportional to the amount of excited174Yb. This perhaps suggests that excitation exchanging collisionsareoccurringinsidethebuffergascell,resultinginexited172Yb(andother isotopes) when only one isotope,174Yb, is resonantly excited. We have observed cross enhancement in other isotopologues of YbOH in addition to172YbOH. Finally,weinvestigatedtheeffectofthelaserenhancedchemicalreactionsonthein- ternalstatedistributionsoftheresultingYbOHmolecules. Theenhancementfactor as a function of rotational and vibrational state is shown in Fig. 5.2. The rotational states were probed via absorption spectroscopy of the11()transitions of the origin band [116]. The enhancement factor of the 2+(1,0,0)vibrational state were measured via absorption spectroscopy of the 21/2(1,0,0)2+(1,0,0) transitionat17378.58cm1[116],whilethe 2+(0,22,0)wasprobedviaabsorp- tion spectroscopy of a Based on initial dispersedLIF(DLIF)measurementsofYbOH[135],thelineat17345.09cm1was believedtoarotationalcomponentofthediagonal 2+(0,1,0) 21/2(0,1,0) band. However, recent high-resolution spectroscopic measurements (described in Section 6.6) indicate that this original assignment may be incorrect, and a tentative re-assignment attributes the band at 17345 cm1to the 2+(0,22,0)[ 18.00]100 transition. Here,[18.00]designates an excited state residing around 18000 cm1. The existence of an excited state at around 18000 cm1is speculative and, at the timeofwriting,directexcitationfromthe 2+(0,0,0)stateto[18.00]hasnotyet been observed. Experiments to definitively confirm the existence of the [18.00] state are underway. 0 1 2 3 4 Rotational State (N)91011Enhancement Factor a.) (000) (100) (0220)* Vibrational State (v1,v2,v3) b.)

A more thorough description of this tentative assignment is given in the text. The energy scales of the Yb excitation, and therefore the chemical reactions, are orders of magnitude larger than the rotational or vibration energies of YbOH. Due to this large energy difference, we expect the resulting YbOH population to be distributed over many rotational and vibrational states. However, following the chemical reactions, the product YbOH should collide with the background 4 K helium, quickly thermalizing the rotational and transnational degrees of freedom of the molecules. The relatively uniform enhancement factor for the lowest rota- tional states, Fig. 5.2 a, indicates that this rotational thermalization does indeed101 occur. Conversely, helium vibrational distributions in CBGB sources. There- fore, we expect this lack of vibrational thermalization to result in an enhanced non-thermal vibrational population (uniform enhancement factor across multiple vibrational states). This enhanced non-thermal vibrational population is indeed observed and shown in Fig. 5.2 b. Laser-enhanced chemical reactions are not limited to the production of YbOH and haverecentlybeenusedfortheproductionofaCaOHCBGBforthelasercoolingand trapping of CaOH [60]. Enhanced production via laser excitation of atomic metal centerscouldalsoaidintheproductionofotherYb,Ca,Sr,Ba,Ra,orAlcontaining molecules,especiallyforthecaseofrareisotopolugeswhereefficientproductionis critical. Laser-enhanced chemical reactions also prove to be a useful spectroscopic resource.

Additionally, comparing molecular spectra with and without the chemical enhancement will allow the disentangling of complex isotopologue structure and identification of the spectrum of specific molecules and molecular isotopologues. The development and implementation of a novel spectroscopic technique utilizing these laser-enhanced chemical reactions is described in Sections 5.3 and 5.4. This techique was critical for the observation of the spectrum of the odd isotopologues, 171,173YbOH, decribed in this chapter. Characterizations of the laser-enhanced chemical reactions with respect to additional laser and CBGB source parameter as well as quantum chemical calculations of these chemical reactions can be found in [128]. 5.2 Experimental setup for171,173YbOH spectroscopy Initial studies of171,173YbOH were performed using the LIF spec- trometeratASU.Thisspectrometerwasusedintheprevioushigh-resolutionoptical studiesof172,174YbOH[93,116].

Theresultingbeamisskimmedtoproduceawell-collimatedbeamwith a temporal pulse width of 40s in the detection region. The molecular beam is probed by an unfocused ( 5 mm), low power ( 5 mW), single-frequency cw-dye102 laser approximately 0.5 m downstream. It is estimated that the laser probes ap- pulses at each excitation laser frequency are summed. The absolute excitation wavelength is determined by co-recording a sub-Doppler I 2spectrum [136], and the relative wavelength is measured by co- recording the transmission of an actively stabilized etalon (free spectral range of 751.393 MHz). High-resolutionabsorptionspectroscopymeasurementsof171,173YbOHwererecorded at Caltech using the 4 K CBGB source described in Ch. 3. The cell configuration used for these measurements is as follows: gas inlet, 0.125-inch blank, diffuser plate, 0.5-inch blank, 1.0-inch window piece for ablation (with snorkel), 0.5-inch blank, 0.5-inch window piece for window), and 0.25- inch aperture plate (5-mm aperture). All measurements were performed inside the buffer-gas cell, as opposed to in the extracted beam. YbOH molecules created by ablating(532nm,30mJ/pulse,5Hz)eitherastoichiometricYb+Yb(OH) 3ora Yb + Te(OH) 6+KF The mixture ratios for the Yb + Te(OH) 6+KF were 0.17 : 3 : 1.83 and 0.25 : 3 : 1.75 (Te(OH) 6: Yb : KF). To measure the absorption spectra, three cw-laser beams are passed through the spectroscopy window: the primary tunable absorption spectroscopy beam (1 mm diameter,30W), the normalization laser (1 mm diameter, 40W) used to monitor the shot-to-shot fluctuations in YbOH production, and the chemical en- hancement laser (3 mm diameter, 300 mW), which increases the molecular yield byexcitingatomicYbtothemetastable31stateasdescribedaboveinSection5.1. The normalization laser is fixed to either the12(2)or11(2)line produc- tion. The12(2)or11(2)lineof the 21/2(0,0,0)2+(0,0,0)transition of172YbOH were used for normalization as they are unblended. The frequency of the enhancement laser is fixed to the3110transition of the resulting absorption is detected with a photodiode. The absolute frequency of the primary absorption laser is monitored by a digital wavemeter, and the relative frequency is tracked in a separate transfer cavity with respect to a stabilized HeNe laser(7MHzresolution). Theabsolutetransitionfrequenciesarecalibratedusing known172YbOH and174YbOH spectral features [116]. The light of the enhance- ment laser is switched on and off using a mechanical shutter so that both enhanced and unenhanced spectra of the desired isotopologue can be measured in successive shots. 5.3 Novelspectroscopictechniqueutilizinglaser-enhancedchemicalreactions The seven fairly abundant naturally occurring isotopes of Yb (see Section 2.11 for abundances)resultinaverycomplicatedandcongestedisotopologuespectroscopic structure in YbOH. The small isotopic spectral shifts (due to the similarity of the potential energy surfaces of 2+(0,0,0)and 21/2(0,0,0)states) result in an especially congested spectrum in the bandhead region of the 21/2(0,0,0) 2+(0,0,0)band, from 17323.50 cm1to 17323.85 cm1. Though this region of the spectrum contains many overlapped lines from all seven isotopologues, it is dominated by the two most abundent172YbOH and174YbOH isotopologues. The absorption spectrum of this bandhead region is shown in Fig. 5.3 with some of the dominate172,174YbOH spectral features indicated. Several \"strong\" isolated 173YbOH features are also indicated in in Fig.5.3. As can be seen, the173YbOH linesareseveralfactorssmallerthanthoseofthemoredominanteven172,174YbOH isotopologues. Therefore, observation and assignment of the173YbOH spectral features in this region using traditional methods is extremely challenging due to theiroverlapwiththemuchstrongereven172,174YbOHfeatures. Thesamesituation occurswith171YbOHisotopolgueaswell,thoughincontrastto173YbOH,noteven a single line is isolated enough to be observed. Inordertoobservethespectrumoftheoddisotopologuesinthebandheadandother regions, we developed a novel spectroscopic technique which utilizes the laser- enhancedchemicalreactions(chemicalenhancement). Thistechniqueisillustrated for171YbOHinFig. 5.4anddescribedbelow. Boththeenhancedandnon-enhanced spectra are recorded using in cell absorption spectroscopy. The OD is integrated over the duration of the molecular pulse and normalized by the integrated OD of the 21/2(0,0,0) 2+(0,0,0)band of YbOH. Several12and11branch features of the 172,174YbOH indicated as well as several isolated173YbOH fea- tures. The normalized signal at a single laser frequency without the enhancement light (Fig. 5.4 a) is=171+, where171is the measured integrated OD for 171YbOH, and is the background integrated OD from all other overlapping YbOHisotopologuesorothermolecules.

Finally, this technique generalizes to all other isotopologues of YbOH and other molecules that can be produced via laser-enhanced chemical reactions.105 Normalized Integrated O.D.

Thisfigurewasreproducedfrom Ref. [129] with permission from AIP.106 5.4 Observation of the171,173YbOH spectra The analysis here focuses on the 21/2(0,0,0)2+(0,0,0)band of the odd isotopologues,171,173YbOH. A description of the 21/2(0,0,0)2+(0,0,0) band for the even isotopologues,172,174YbOH, can be found in Ref. [116]. The spectrum of the odd isotopologues is much more complex than that of the even isotopologues due to the strong171Yb (=1/2,=+0.49367) and173Yb (=5/2,=0.67989) magnetic as well large nuclearelectricquadrupolehyperfineinteraction( =280.0\u00b14.0fm2)in173YbOH [138]. This strong magnetic hyperfine interaction in the odd isotopologues results in coupling of the electron spin, , to the nuclear spin of the Yb, to give the intermediate approximately good quantum number =+.then couples to the rotation to give the intermediate quantum number 1=+which in then couples to the proton nuclear spin, , to give the total angular momentum . Therefore, the low rotational energy levels of the 2+(0,0,0)state of the odd isotopologues are best described by a Hund's case (b ) coupling scheme and the corresponding coupling limit wavefunction, |(),()1,(1). On the other hand, both the Yb and H hyperfine interactions in the excited 21/2(0,0,0) state are small compared to the rotation and -doubling such that the energy levels of the 21/2(0,0,0)state of the odd isotopologues are best described by a near sequentially coupled Hund's case (a ) coupling scheme and the corresponding coupling limit wavefunction, |,|,|,,()1,(1). Besides small broadeningofthelowrotationalbranchfeaturesofthemolecularbeamLIFspectra, no evidence of the proton hyperfine splitting was observed. Here we used the same branch designations previously utilized for the description of the21/2(=0)2+(=0)band of the even and odd isotopologues of YbF [139]. even isotopologues of YbOH exhibit 6 bands,11,11, and12, which are labeled according to the , () convention appropriate for a21/2(Hund's case (a)) -2(Hund's case (b)) band. FortheoddisotopologuesofYbOH,thesesixbranchessplitandregroupintoeight branches and blue (11and1) of the band head. As discussed in the previous section, the small isotope shifts result in the even isotoplologue11, 12,11, and12, and odd isotopologue1+1, and1+1 and calculated predictions of the12(3)even isotopologue and1odd isotopologue branch features of the 21/2(0,0,0)2+(0,0,0)bandofYbOH.Theevenisotopologuespectrumwas predicted using the optimized parameters (or isotopically scaled values) given in Ref. [116]. Thepredicted171,173YbOHspectrawerecalculatedusingtheoptimized parameters determined in this study and given in Table 5.1. A temperature of 15 K and Lorentzian full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 30 MHz was used for all predictions. The lines marked with * are unidentified. This figure was reproduced from Ref. [129] with permission from AIP. The molecular beam LIF data and calculated spectrum in the region of the even 12(3)and odd1(3)lines is shown in Fig. 5.5. The calculated spectrum for the even172,174YbOH isotopologues were obtained using the optimized parameters given in Ref. [116], while for the even170,176YbOH isotopologes these parameters werescaledbytheirexpectedisotopicdependence. Thecalculatedspectrumforthe108 odd isotopologues was obtained using the optimized parameters determined in this study and given in Table 5.1. For all calculated spectra, a rotational temperature of 15KandaLorentzianlineshapewithafullwidthathalfmaximum(FWHM)of30 MHz was used. For a Hund's case (b ) state, the Fermi contact hyperfine interaction has only diagonal matrix elements which are given by [140] (),()|I\u00b7S|(),() = 2[(+1)(+1)(+1)],(5.1) where here we have neglected the effects of the proton nuclear spin as levels of different values is oppositein173YbOHcomparedto171YbOH,withthelower states(=0)lower inenergyin171YbOHwhilethehigher states(=3)lowerinenergyin173YbOH. The opposite ordering is due to the opposite sign of the nuclear magnetic moments of the171Yb and173Yb nuclei. This is reflected in the opposite ordering of the 1(3)linesinFig. 5.5(stateslowerinenergyresultinhigherenergytransitions). The splitting between the1()(and also the1()) branches remains constantfordifferentvaluesof sincetheenergysplittingfromtheFermicontact interaction remains constant over all rotational states. AsdiscussedinSection5.3andshowninFig. 5.3,thebandheadregionoftheYbOH spectrumisdominatedbythe11,11,12,and12evenisotopologuebranch features. The dominance of the even isotopologues makes the observation and as- signment of the odd isotopologue1+1and1+1branch features nearly impossible. Therefore, utilizing the chemical enhancement technique, de- scribed in Section 5.3, proved critical in the measurement of the odd isotopologue branchfeaturesinthebandheadregion. Theobservedandpredictedhigh-resolution absorptionspectrumofthecryogenicbuffergascooled(CBGC)sampleintheband- headregionispresentedinFig. 5.6. Fig. 5.6 aisthespectrumwithnoenhancement light (same as Fig. 5.3), while Fig. 5.6 bis the spectrum with the enhancement lightappliedandonresonancewiththeatomic173Ybtransition. Theenhancedpro-109 duction due to the atomic excitation provides approximately a factor of 4 increase in the173YbOH signals. The difference between the enhanced and non-enhanced spectra (b-a) is presented in Fig. 5.6 cand is the spectrum of only the173YbOH isotopologue. The prediction of the173YbOH spectrum in this region is presented in Fig. 5.6 d. The prediction was made using the optimized parameters determined in this study (Table 5.1), a rotational temperature of 5 K, and a 90 MHz FWHM lineshape. A comparison of Fig. 5.6 aandcshows that the chemical enhancement techniquedevelopedhereprovidesasignificantsimplificationoftheobservedspec- trum as well as an improvement in the signal to noise ratio. While the chemical enhancementtechniqueallowedtheisolationofthe173YbOHspectrum,thespectral features presented in Fig. 5.6 care still a blend of many lines. The feature marked \"A\" in Fig. 5.6 is primarily a blend of the12+12(1)( 1=3 1=3) and12+12(2)( 1=4 1=4)173YbOH transitions. The feature marked \"B\" in Fig. 5.6 is primarily a in the bandhead region is also presented inFig. 5.7.

The difference between the enhanced171YbOH and unenhanced spectrum ( a-b) is shown in Fig. 5.7 d. In contrast to the173YbOH spectrum (shown in Fig. 5.6 c), the171YbOH spectrum has several unblended features in the bandhead region. For example the featurelabeled\"A\"inFig. labeled the1featuresshowninFig. 5.5),recordingthechemicallyenhancedabsorption spectrum proved critical for the disentanglement and assignment of the branch features in this region as well. The disentangling of the171YbOH11(2)lines is110 demonstrated in Fig. 5.8. The left side of Fig. 5.8 presents the molecular beam LIF in the region of the even isotopologue11(2)and odd isotopologue1(2) lines. The right side of Fig. 5.8 presents the CBGC absorption spectrum in this same region.

The matrices for both states were constructed )basis. the analysis, optimizations were performed for various combinations of floated parameters. In all optimization cases, the proton magnetic hyperfine parameters of the2+(0,0,0)state were fixed to the values determined in the microwave study of174YbOH (=4.80MHz and=2.46MHz, see Ch. 4) [93]. The spin orbit parameter was fixed to the previously determined value, =1350cm1[105]. The results of the analysis are relatively insensitive to the value of , other than the general offset in the value of 00. The rotationally induced spin-uncoupling effect is negligible in the 21/2(0,0,0)state, e.g./104. It was found that floating the centrifugal distortion , for both the 2+(0,0,0)and 21/2(0,0,0)statesandthespinrotationparameter, predicted from using the expected isotopicdependence. The173YbOHdatasetwasadequatelyfitbyoptimizing10pa- rametersandthe171YbOHdatasetwasfitbyoptimizing8parameters. Thestandard deviation of the fits was 27 and 25 MHz for171YbOH and173YbOH respectively, both commensurate with the estimated weighted measurement uncertainty. The optimized parameters and associated errors for171,173YbOH are presented in Table 5.1. Also presented are the equivalent values for171YbF [142, 143] 2+(0,0,0)bands of171,173YbOH. The spectral predictions were obtained in the following manner. The electric dipole transition moment matrix was calculated in a sequentially coupled Hund's case (a ) ba- sis which was then cross multiplied by the eigenvectors to obtain the transition113 moments. The relative transition intensities were determined by the product of the square of the transition moment, a Boltzmann factor, and the relative Yb iso- topic abundance. The spectra was then predicted using the transitions frequencies, relative intensities, and a Lorentzian lineshape. The171YbOH and173YbOH pa- rameters determined in this study were used in the predictions. The parameters for174YbOH[2+(0,0,0)]were taken from the microwave analysis (Ch. 4) [93], whiletheparametersfor174YbOH[21/2(0,0,0)],172YbOH[2+(0,0,0)],and 172YbOH[21/2(0,0,0)]were taken from the previous optical analysis [116]. The parameters for170YbOH and176YbOH were determined via extrapolation of the known171YbOH,172YbOH,173YbOH, and174YbOH parameters using the ex- pected mass dependence. For all isotopologues, the 2+(0,0,0)proton magnetic hyperfineparameterswerefixedtothe174YbOHvaluesdeterminedinthemicrowave study, while the proton hyperfine parameters in the 21/2(0,0,0)state were set to zero. The parameters for the 2+(0,0,0)and 21/2(0,0,0)states of all the YbOH isotopologues of YbOH that were used in these predictions can be found in Table S3 of the supplementary material of Ref.

The odd isotopolouge parameters determined here will allow the accurate calculation of the173YbOH energy levels neededforthedesignofNMQMexperimentstatepreparationandreadoutschemes. Additionally, the spectroscopic work here provides an essential starting point for the investigation of excited electronic and vibrational states of173YbOH, such as the2+(0,1,0)science state, needed for the finial implementation of an NMQM measurement with173YbOH. The chemical enhancement spectroscopic technique demonstrated in this work will be critical in the characterization of other states in the odd isotopologues of YbOH. InadditiontothedesignandimplementationofanNMQMmeasurement,thechar- acterization of the 21/2(0,0,0)2+(0,0,0)bands isotopologues allowstheidentificationofrotationallyclosedphotoncyclingschemesfor171YbOH and173YbOH. For the even isotopologues, this is accomplished by driving the 12(1)and12(1)transitions terminating in the =1/2+ parity level of the 21/2(0,0,0)state. For the even isotopologues the =1/2+ parity state can only decay back down to the =1levels of the 2+(0,0,0)state, provid- ing rotational closure. For the odd isotopologues, the measurements performed in this study indicate that the branching ratio for the (=1/2,+)21/2(0,0,0) (=3,)2+(0,0,0)transition is approximately 1% relative to the (= the equivalent1+1(1)transitions of171YbOH and173YbOH are not rota- closed and leakage to the =3level of the 2+(0,0,0)state will occur after about 100 photon scatters. This branching to the =3state is primarily due to the hyperfine interactions mixing the =1/2and=3/2, + parity levels of 21/2(0,0,0)state. We can estimate the extent of this mixing with first-order perturbation theory. The free field the eigenstates are best described in the parity symmetrized Hund's sideredsincetheprotonhyperfineeffectsinthe 21/2(0,0,0)statearenegligible.

Additionally, the electric quadrupole interaction will also add to the mixing. This gives (omitting the functional the |= 1/2,1,+state is approximately 1-3% |=3/2,1,+. This accounts for the 1%branching to the =3level of the 2+(0,0,0)state. Even though there are strong hyperfine interactions in171,173YbOH, the mixing of the=1/2and+3/2+paritystatesisprimarilyduetothesmallenergyspacing (3GHz) between them. This results fromthe combination of the relatively small rotational constant and the large, negative -doubling parameter. The relatively large (in comparison to the rotational parameter) -doubling parameter results in an energy level pattern with pairs of same-parity rotational levels of =\u00b11/2 lying close in energy 4. This small separation of adjacent same-parity rotational levelsiswhatallowsthehyperfineinteractionstocausesignificantmixing. Eq. 5.17 provides a good estimate of the mixing of the =1/2and=3/2+ parity levels in a21/2state and can be used to estimate if this mixing will cause significant rotational losses when photon cycling in any molecule which utilizes an excited 21/2state in the cycling or repumping transitions.

As part of calculation of the NMQM coupling constant, , in YbOH [70], the ground state hyperfine parameter ||(=+2 3) and the axial electric quadrupole coupling constant 20, were predicted.

These predictions are compared to the measured values in Tables 5.2 and 5.3. There are no predictions for the 21/2(0,0,0)state hyperfine parameters. The171,173YbOH hyperfine parameters calculated via relativistic coupled cluster methods are in excellent agreement with the measured values. The magnetic hy- perfine parameters differ by only 2.5%[70] while the 20parameters differ by 5.5%[70] and 5.2%[146]. The larger discrepancy in the electric quadrupole pa- rameter may indicate that it is more difficult to calculate the core polarization than the valence electron structure. The excellent agreement between the measured and calculated hyperfine parameters suggests that the calculated value of for the 2+(0,0,0)state of173YbOH in Ref.

If we assume that is valuesof thevalues of171,173YbOH are7%smaller than the corresponding values of171,173YbF. This indicates that the OHligand more effectively polarizes (larger 6/6/6hybridization) the valence electron away from the bonding region than theFligand. Thisisconsistentwiththepointchargeelectrostaticmodelprediction which correctly predicted the ground state electric dipole moments of YbOH and YbF [116].125 In contrast to , the , (5.26) where now the sum over is over only the valence electrons and the sum over is over the core electrons. Noting that there is only a single valence electron, we can also recast Eq. 5.24 in 2+(0,0,0) state of173YbOH. The remaining 0.0646cm1is due to the core polarization.

This value is in qualitative agreement with the measured value considering the assumptions about the orbital compositions made.127 C h a pte r 6 Frequency Modulation Spectroscopy of YbOH This chapter describes the implementation of frequency modulation (FM) absorp- tion spectroscopy in the cryogenic buffer gas cell and the spectroscopy of YbOH performed using this FM technique.

Specifically,theFM absorption spectrum of the 21/2(1,0,0)2+(3,0,0),[17.68], and[17.64] the 21/2(1,0,0)2+(3,0,0)repumping transitions needed for laser coolingaswellasdeterminethemolecularparametersofthe 2+(3,0,0)statefor the first time. The [17.68]and[17.64]bands were initially assigned to originate from the 2+(0,0,0)state and terminate in excited vibronic states at 17680 cm1 and[17.64]bandsindicatedthattheseexcitedstatesshouldcontain 21/2(0,1,0) character [135], which could be useful for state preparation and readout in both the eEDM and NMQM experiments. However, the measurements described here, indicatethatthe[17.68]and[17.64]bandsdonotoriginatefromthe 2+(0,0,0) ground state. 6.1 Frequency modulation absorption spectroscopy: Theory Frequency modulation absorption spectroscopy (FM spectroscopy) allows the sen- sitive measurement of the absorption (or dispersion) signals of very weak spectral features[148-150]. Thisisaccomplishedbypushingtheabsorptionanddispersion signalsintotheradiofrequency(rf)regime. Dealingwithrfsignalsreducesthe 1/ noise in the system while additional noise rejection is provided via phase-sensitive detection of the rf signals. Working in the rf regime is especially beneficial in our CBGB source as many of the noise sources are in the Hz-kHz range (the pulse tube operates at 4 Hz and the laser locks at kHz frequencies) and FM spectroscopy enables significant suppression of these noise sources. A brief description of the theory behind FM spectroscopy is given below; more thorough descriptions can be found in Ref. [148, 151, 152]. The electric field of a128 single-frequency laser is given by [148, 151] 0()=0exp0+.., (6.1) where0is the carrier frequency of the unmodulated laser light. The laser beam is then passed through a phase modulator that is driven by a sinusoidal rf field of frequency , the modulation frequency. Following the phase modulator, the electric field of the laser is given by =0exp[(0+sin)]+.. =0exp(0) =()exp((0+))+..,(6.2) where()is the orderBessel function of argument .is the modulation depthwhichisdependentontheamplitudeoftherffielddrivingthephasemodulator. The frequency spectrum of the phase modulated laser will contain a component at the carrier frequency, 0, and sideband components located at integer multiples of \u00b1from the carrier. Now consider a sample with a frequency-dependent absorption coefficient, (), and frequency-dependent index of refraction, (). The amplitude attenuation (absorption 1) is given by ()=()/2and the phase shift is given by ()= ()/(dispersion) 2. The frequency dependence of ()and()are the absorption and dispersion lineshapes, respectively. Then the transmission function of the sample is [151] ()=exp[()()]. (6.3) If the frequency modulated laser is passed through the sample the electric field of the resulting, transmitted laser beam is =0exp(0) =(0+)()exp((0+))+..(6.4) If the transmitted laser is detected with a fast photodiode, the signal will be pro- portional to the intensity of the laser, ()= \u00af 2. The signal will then contain frequency components at dc and at integer multiples of , due to the beating of any pair of the laser frequency components separated by integer multiples of . 1If this expression is compared to Eq. 3.8 in Ch. 3, we can see that 2()=()()and therefore,()=()(). 2is the speed of light and is path length.129 If phase sensitive detection is used, the terms oscillating at a frequency of can be isolated. Expanding Eq. 6.4 in the limit of weak absorption and dispersion and only keeping the terms with a frequency of gives \u00af =2 0exp[2(0)] \u00d7\" 2 cos =0()+1()[(0(+1))(0+(+1)) +(0)(0+)] +2 sin =0()+1()[(0(+1))(0) +(0+(+1))(0+)]].

(6.10) Note in the above equations the amplitude of both andare pro- portional to , higher modulation depthswillincreasetheFMsignalsize. However,athighenoughmodulationdepths, higher-order sidebands will no longer be negligible and will need to be accounted for. Eq. 6.9and6.10provideagoodintuitiveunderstandingofhowFMabsorption works. TheFMabsorptionsignalistheresultofthedifferentialabsorptionbetween the two sidebands, while the FM dispersion signal is the difference between the average phase shift of the sidebands and twice the phase shift of the carrier. TheenhancedsensitivityprovidedbyFMabsorptionisoftenusedtomeasureweak absorptionfeatures. Inthecaseofweakabsorption,theamplitudeattenuationofthe carrier due to absorption of the sample will be negligible. In this limit (absorption of1%), the factor of exp[2()]1in Eq. 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, and 6.10. If the absorption is 1%, then the carrier will be attenuated and this effect will need to be accounted for in the lineshape. given in Eq. 6.6 is refered to as the in phase signal, the demodulated signal that is in phase with the rf reference at the mixer. Experimentally, the phase angle describing the mixing of the absorption and dispersion components in is not easily determined. Therefore, it is also convenient to measure the in-quadrature signal as well. This is accomplished with an I and Q demodulator, which is a dual outputmixer,mixingtheinputsignalwiththerfreference(Ichannel)andtheinput signal with the rf reference after a 90phase shift is applied (Q channel). The quadrature FM signal is given by [151] ()=sin()cos(). (6.11) With a simultaneous measurement of both andthe phase angle, can be determined. Examples of absorption, dispersion, in-phase and in-quadrature FM signals are shown in Section 6.2 and 6.3 below. A discussion of the lineshapes themselves is also given.131 6.2 FM lineshapes and determining optimal modulation frequency Both the()and()lineshapes have a critical dependence on the frac- tional modulation frequency, the ratio of the ) to the lineshape ( ()).()lineshapes various of /resulting from are showninFig. 6.1.

The model used to generate these lineshapes is discussed in Section 6.3 below. For thelineshapespresentedhere,andforallotherlineshapespresentedinthischapter, the weak absorption limit was applied, e.g., exp(2()) 1, and the lineshapes were modeled to second order, e.g., the effects of both the first- and second-order sidebands were included. The()lineshapes take an intuitive form due to their origin from the differ- entialabsorption betweenthe sidebands. TheFMabsorption lineshapesare always comprised of a negative and positive peak separated by twice the modulation fre- quency. The amplitude of these peaks grows with increasing /until around /0.5where the peak to peak amplitude saturates.

In our case, we are utilizing FM spectroscopy to measure the spectrumofweakbandsofYbOH.Inourmeasurements,wewanttoaimtooptimize the signal-to-noise ratio of the FM signal while preserving the ability to accurately measuretransitionfrequencies. Therefore,wewanttomaximizeboththeamplitude of the FM signal as well as the slope at . The peak to peak amplitude of both ()and()as a function of /is shown in Fig. 6.3.

Inadditiontoimprovingsensitivity,wealsowanttomeasurethetransitionfrequen-135 cies of YbOH lines at high resolution. Therefore, we want to operate in a regime where the FM signals have a non-zero, and preferably large, slope at the transition frequency,. The slope (derivative) of the ()and()lineshapes at as a function of /is shown in Fig. 6.4. When examining Fig. 6.4 it is important to note that the value at which the combined amplitudes are maximized, /=1.18,theslopeof ()isnearzero. Additionally,theslopeof () is also very small when the slope of ()is maximized ( / = 0.91). Due to the reduction of the slope of ()for/>0.39, the combined slopes of the absorption and dispersion FM signals is optimized near the point where they cross, at/0.45. While the slope of ()decreases for /0.45, the slope remains larger than half the maximum slope for /up to0.79. Ad- ditionally, the slope of ()is continually increasing, and larger than the max slope of(), over this range. Therefore, operating at a modulation frequency in the range 0.45/0.79will allow the FM signals to have a nonzero and relatively large slope at . 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 Fractional Modulation Frequency m/ 0.00.20.40.60.81.0Normalized (or as a function of the fractional modulation frequency, /, for a Gaussian absorption lineshape, ().is the full width at half maximum(FWHM)oftheabsorptionlineshape.

By considering the modulation frequencies which maximize signal size ( /> 0.5) as well as provide nonzero and relatively large slope at (0.45/136 0.79) I determined that a modulation frequency in the range 0.5/0.79 is ideal for our spectroscopic purposes. Specifically, we operate at a modulation frequency of /0.56, indicated by the vertical dashed line in Fig. 6.3 and 6.4. The specific value of /was determined partially due to the fact that we alreadyhada 2\u00d750.3MHzEOMinthelaboratory. A 2\u00d750.3MHzmodulation frequency falls in the optimal range for FM spectroscopy inside our buffer gas cell (the measured in cell linewidth is 2\u00d790MHz). 6.3 Modeling FM lineshapes Forisolatedspectrallines,ameasurementofthezerocrossingoftheFMlineshape, either(), or(), or both, provides a very accurate measurement of the transition frequency. However, for blended lines and in congested regions of the spectrum, the FM lineshapes become distorted, and zero crossing measurements may no longer provide an accurate measurement of the transition frequencies. Ad- ditionally,whentherearemultipletransitionswithinasinglespectrallinewidth,the FM signals will not have a zero crossing for each transition present and a simple zero crossing measurement will not account for all the transitions. Therefore, fit- ting the measured FM lineshapes to modeled FM lineshapes is the best method for measuring the transition frequencies of blended features and in congested regions. Here we describe our FM lineshape model and our fitting method. Experimentally, we are measuring the FM spectrum in the buffer gas cell where Dopplerbroadeningdominates. Therefore,ourabsorptionlineshapeisbestmodeled as is linecenter, and is the full widthathalfmaximum(FWHM).Thedispersionlineshapecanbecalculatedfrom the of the absorption line shape [155]. The Hilbert transform of 3This integral, to my knowledge, does not have a closed form solution for a Gaussian line- shape. However,theKramers-KronigrelationshipdoeshaveaclosedformsolutionforaLorentzian given the absorption lineshape, ()the dispersion line shape is given by the negative Hilbert transform of the absorption lineshape ()=()(). (6.15) If we the transform of ()=exp(2)is known and is related to convenient for numerical 4. absorption and dispersion lineshapes (Eq. 6.12 and 6.18) are shown in the top left and right panels of Fig. 6.5, respectively. Ultimately, we want to model a true absorption spectrum which will contain an arbitrary superposition of Gaussian lineshapes ()= ()= exp\u0012 ()2 2(/2.355)\u0013 , (6.19) 4The Dawson function is a built in special function in python, which is the language used here to model the FM lineshapes.138 wheredenotes the absorption lineshape due to the ith transition, and is the resonance frequency of the ith transition. Therefore, the total dispersion lineshape due to the combination of multiple transitions is given by ()=1 () = 2 () 2(/2.355)! .(6.20) The simulated total Gaussian absorption and dispersion lineshapes for five closely spacedandblendedtransitionsareshowninthetopleftandrightpanelsofFig. 6.6, respectively. With Eq. 6.19 and 6.20, any arbitrary absorption and dispersion line shape can be modeled. Any arbitrary FM lineshape can be modeled by using Eq. 6.19 and 6.20 in Eq. 6.7, 6.8, 6.6, and 6.11. However, Eq. 6.7 and 6.8 account for the attenuation of the carrier due to strong absorption as well as the effects of the sidebands of all orders. WhilemodelingtheFMlineshapesusingEq. 6.7and6.8wouldprovidethe most accurate models, including the aforementioned effects is excessive and could complicate the fitting by providing too large of an optimization space. We are specifically utilizing FM spectroscopy to measure weak absorption lines so operating in the weak absorption limit, discussed in Section 6.1, is justified. Therefore, in our FM linshape model we assume exp[2()] 1. Additionally, Eq. 6.9 and 6.10 indicate that at lower modulation depth ()/() andtherefore,operatingathighermodulationdepthswillresultinlargerFMsignals. Experimentally,weobservethistrendwithlargersignalsizesforlargermodulation depths. In order to maximize our FM signal sizes we operate at a modulation depth of=0.84. The modulation depth is fixed to this value for all modeled FM lineshapes shown in this chapter. At this modulation depth we find that the amplitude of the the first-order sidebands is 20%of the and ()and ()lineshapestosecondorder(then=0,1termsinEq. 6.7and6.8). Therefore,139 in the small absorption limit the FM absorption lineshape is given by [153] 2 ()=0()1()[()(+)] +1()2()[(2)(+2)+()(+)], (6.21) and the FM ()=0()1()[()+(+)2()] the()and()lineshapes are calculated using Eq. 6.6 and 6.11 respectively, where ()is given by Eq. 6.21, ()is given by Eq. 6.22, ()is given by Eq. 6.19, and ()is given by Eq. 6.20. The simulated I and Q FM lineshapes at various values of between=0and =for a single transition with a Gaussian absorption lineshape are shown in Fig. 6.5. Amodulationfrequencyof /=0.56,thesamemodulationfrequency used in our FM setup, was used when modeling the lineshapes in Fig. 6.5. The simulated I and Q FM lineshapes at various values of between=0and= for five closely spaced transitions are shown in Fig. 6.6. Here, the FWHM of all transitions was set to 90 MHz and a modulation frequency of 50.3 MHz was used (/ = 0.56). In Fig. 6.6 several of the transitions are blended to illustrate the resulting FM lineshapes when blended lines are present. In all cases, both isolated transitions in Fig. 6.5 and blended transitions in Fig. 6.6, at a phase angle of =0 ()(=0)=()and()(=0)=(). As the phase angle increases the I and Q signals become mixtures of ()and()up angles of < < 2 ()()=()(=)and()()=()(=). In all cases()(+2)=()()and()(+2)=()(). Ultimately, we want to perform a simultaneous fit of our modeled I and Q FM linshapestothemeasuredIandQFMdata.

In our case we are performing FM spectroscopy inside a cryogenic buffer gas cell. As previously mentioned, the measured spectral linewidths inside the cell are 90MHz and dominated by Doppler broadening. The tunable laser laser light usedfortheFMspectroscopyisderivedviathesum-frequencygenerationofaCW Ti:Sapph and 1550 nm fiber laser 6. This laser system can tune over much of the visable range and has a linewidth of <50kHz. Sidebands are applied to the laser with resonant electro-optic phase modulator (EOM) (Thorlabs EO-PM-R-50.3-C4). Thisrfpowercorrespondstoamodulationdepth of=0.84. The EOM was pre-calibrated the relationship between applied rf power and modulation depth. This was accomplished by measuring the amplitude of the carrier, first-, and second-order sidebands as a function of the applied rf power with a scanning Fabry-Perot cavity. The normalized amplitudes (normalized to the amplitude of the carrier when with no rf power applied) vs rf power of the carrier, first- and second-order sidebands were fit to the square of the =0,1,2Bessel functions, 2 (= ), respectively. The fits determined the proportionality coefficient, , which allows the conversion of the applied rf power to the modulation depth. Experimentally, this conversion was found to be very accurate and reproducible. The50.3rfdriveissuppliedfromaNovatech(409B)signalgenerator. Theamplitude of the Novatech output is set such that there is 69.8 mW of rf power at the EOM. The output of the Novatech is immediately split with a 50/50 splitter. One output of the 50/50 splitter feeds a 24 dB amplifier (Mini-Circuits ZHL-3A+) which in turn drives the EOM. The other output of the 50/50 splitter passes through a 25 dB low-noise amplifier (Mini-Circuits ZX60-P103LN+), phase shifter (Mini-Circuits JSPHS-51+), and into the local oscillator (LO) port of the I and Q demodulator (Pulsar Microwave Corp. IDO-03-412). The 25 dB amplifier and 1 dB attenuator set the rf power going into the phase shifter to 7.6dBm. Itwasexperimentallyfoundthatthisphaseshifterinputpoweroptimized the FM signal SNR.

However, we found that the lock-in introduced a large amount of 60 Hz and120 Hz line noise which could not be easily filtered out. Therefore, we abandoned the rf lock-in and moved to the discrete rf circuit as it provided much better SNR. 2.76 2.78 2.80 2.82 2.84 2.86 2.88 2.90 Frequency -17680 cm1 6 4 2 024Integrated IFM Signal (arb.)Nomalized FM In Phase 2.76 2.78 2.80 2.84 2.86 of YbOH.

In order to laser cool and trap YbOH, 10,000 photons need to be scattered and, therefore, higher vibrational losses must be addressed. FM spec- troscopy in a cryogenic buffer gas cell is an optimal method with which to identify repumping transitions for two major reasons. First, FM spectroscopy provides the needed sensitivity to be able to measure weak repumping transitions. Second, as discussed in Section 5.1, the laser-enhanced chemical reactions which occur in our cellincreasethepopulationofexcitedvibrationalstatesandprovidetheneededex- citedstatevibrationalpopulationsfromwhichrepumpingtransitionscanbedriven. Here,wemeasurethespectrumofthe 21/2(1,0,0)2+(3,0,0)bandofYbOH using in cell FM spectroscopy. Experiment The same experimental FM spectroscopy setup described in Section 6.4 was used to measure the 21/2(1,0,0) 2+(3,0,0)transition. The following buffer148 gas cell configuration was used (see Section 3.2): gas inlet, 0.125-inch blank, diffuser plate, 0.5-inch blank, 1.0-inch window piece for ablation (with snorkel), 0.5-inch blank, 0.5-inch window piece for spectroscopy (spectroscopy window), and 0.25-inch aperture plate. Molecule by ablating a stoichiometricYb+Yb(OH) 3+PEGtargetwithapulsedNd:YAGlaser(532nm,42 mJ/pulse). Laser-enhanced chemical reactions were driven with the enhancement laser (3 mm in diameter, 300 mW) which is fixed to the3110174Yb transition at 17992.0003 cm1[137]. The enhancement laser was introduced into the cell through the spectroscopy window and was applied for every ablation shot. Intheabsenceoftheenhancementlight,noFMsignalswerepresentand,therefore, the FM signals observed with the enhancement light present were due to only the 174YbOH isotopologue. FM spectroscopy was performed with a 3.5 mW CW laser ( 1 mm in diameter) which was derived from, as described previously, the sum-frequency generation of a CW Ti:Sapph and 1550 nm fiber laser. The FM laser is introduced into the cell through the spectroscopy window. To record the spectrum, the FM spectroscopy laser was continuously scanned and the signal from every five consecutive shots averaged, resulting in 10 MHz spacing between data points. The frequency of the FM laser is continuously recorded with a HighFinesse wavemeter (WS7-30 VIS/Standardmodel)whichisusedtotracktherelativefrequencyspacingbetween datapoints. Thesub-DopplersaturatedabsorptionspectrumofI 2isco-recordedwith the FM used for absolute frequency calibration. Absolute frequency calibration with the sub-Doppler I 2spectrum results in an absolute frequency error of6MHz. In addition to the FM spectroscopy laser, a normalization laser is also introduced into the cell through the spectroscopy window. The normalization laser is fixed to the11(0)line of the 21/2(0,0,0) 2+(0,0,0)band of YbOH [116] and is used to track the shot-to-shot fluctuations in molecular production. The measuredin-phaseandin-quadratureFMsignalsareintegratedoverthedurationof themolecularpulseandnormalizedbytheintegratedDCODfromthenormalization probe to produce the in-phase, (), and in-quadrature, (), spectrum. Observation and assignment The observed in-phase, (), and in-quadrature, (), FM spectrum of a portion of the bandhead region of the 21/2(1,0,0)2+(3,0,0)spectrum of149 174YbOH is presented in Fig. 6.10. Also presented are the predicted in-phase and in-quadrature FM spectra. The predictions were made using the optimized parameters determined in this study (Table 6.1), a phase angle of 5.90 radians, a linewidthof108MHz 9,atemperatureof5K,andtheFMlineshapemodeldescribed inSection6.3. Theutilizationofthelaser-enhancedchemicalreactionsallowedthe isolation of only the174YbOH spectrum. The chemical enhancement technique used to isolate174YbOH spectrum is similar to the approach used to isolate the odd isotopologue spectra in Section 5.3 and [129]. No evidence of H ( I=1/2)) hyperfine splittings was observed in blue degraded bandhead comprised of the low- 11,11,12, and12branches.

This discrepancy between the observed and predicted relative intensities between different branch features was also observed the 21/2(1,0,0) 2+(0,0,0)band [116]. The reduction of the intensities of the12and11branch features (or the increase in the intensity of the12and11branch features) may be due to perturbations arising from the mixing of the 2+and/or the 21/2states with other vibronic states.

These estimated parameters were then used in conjunction with the previously determined parameters for the 21/2(1,0,0)state [116] to predict the 21/2(1,0,0) 2+(3,0,0)spectrum, with which the remaining spectral assignments were made.

The line center, linewidth, and relative amplitude of the Gaussian absorption lineshape of each transition, as well as the overall phase angle between the in-phase and in-quadrature signals were floated in the fit. The line centers resulting from the fit provide a measurement of each transition frequency.153 Analysis The 35 transition frequencies of the 21/2(1,0,0) 2+(3,0,0)band, mea- sured here, were combined with the 65 previously measured transitions frequen- cies of the 21/2(1,0,0) 2+(0,0,0)band (measured via molecular beam LIF) [116] and used as inputs in a non-linear least squares fitting procedure. The two data sets share the same excited 21/2(1,0,0)state and simultaneous fit of both data sets was performed in order to obtain the optimized parameters of the 2+(3,0,0)state as well as improved parameters for the 21/2(1,0,0)state. The 21/2(1,0,0)2+(3,0,0)FMtransitionsfrequenciesweredeterminedto approximately a factor of two higher precision as compared to the molecular beam LIFdataofthe 21/2(1,0,0)2+(0,0,0)bandand,therefore,theFMdataof the21/2(1,0,0)2+(3,0,0)band was weighted twice that of the previously recorded 21/2(1,0,0) 2+(0,0,0)molecular beam LIF data in the fitting procedure. The increased precision of the FM data is due to both the high intrinsic sensitivityoftheFMabsorptionmethodformeasuringtransitionfrequencies(mea- suringsimultaneouszerocrossingofin-phaseandin-quadraturelineshapes)aswell as the isolation of the174YbOH spectrum from that of the the other isotopolouges with the laser-enhanced chemical reactions. Theenergylevelsofthe 2+(0,0,0),2+(3,0,0),andthe 21/2(1,0,0)states were modeled using an effective Hamiltonian approach. The effective Hamiltonian used to model the 2+(0,0,0)state is \u00022+(0,0,0)\u0003 =R2R2R2+N\u00b7S+\u0002 N\u00b7S,R2\u0003 the 2+(0,0,0)state were fixed to the values de- termined with PPMODR microwave spectroscopy (see Ch. 4) [93]. Hamiltonian used to model the 2+(3,0,0)state is \u00022+(3,0,0)\u0003 =0+R2R2R2+N\u00b7S.(6.25) This effective Hamiltonian is the same as that of the 2+(0,0,0)state with the addition of an origin ( 0) to account for the vibrational energy and the removal of the term accounting for the spin-rotation centrifugal distortions. The FM spectrum recorded in the cryogenic buffer gas cell only probed lower transitions and is not sensitive to spin-rotation centrifugal distortions. The effective Hamiltonian used +(6.26) electronic state ( 0), spin-orbit SincenoevidenceofhyperfinesplittingsduetotheHwere hyperfine interactions were not included in the effective Hamiltonians. Even though the 2+(0,0,0)and 2+(3,0,0)states are best described by a Hund'scase(b)basis,alleffectiveHamiltonian'swereconstructedinaHund'scase (a) basis,|,|,|,. The energy levels and eigenstates of the 2+(0,0,0) and 2+(3,0,0)states were determined by constructing and diagonalizing the 34\u00d734 (2(+1)) Hamiltonian for all =0=16rotational levels the full 66 \u00d766 (4+2) Hamiltonian for all =1=16rotational levels. The matrix elements used in the calculation of the effective Hamiltonians were taken from Ref. [89, 92]. The ),-doubling parameter(+2),and-doublingcentrifugaldistortionparameter( (+2))were floated (a total of seven parameters) in the final least-squares fit to the measured transition frequencies. The spin-orbit parameter, , of the 21/2(1,0,0)state was fixed to the value from the high temperature analysis [105]. Fits floating various parameters were performed and an f-test with a 95% confidence interval was used to determine if floating additional parameters (such as (+2) ,, or) was statistically justified. While the f-test indicated floating in both the 2+(3,0,0)and 21/2(1,0,0)states was statistically justified, the error in the resultingfitparameterswas20%ofthefittedvalue. Thisindicatedthatfloating theparameters resulted in optimized values for andthat were not well determined. Therefore, the value of in the 2+(3,0,0)state was fixed to the the value extrapolated from the values of the 2+(0,0,0)and 2+(1,0,0) states using the expected vibrational dependence [81]. The value of in the 21/2(1,0,0)state was fixed to the extrapolated value given in Ref. [116]. The155 optimizedparametersofthe 2+(3,0,0)and 21/2(1,0,0)statesresultingfrom the least-squares fit to the transition frequencies are presented in Table 6.1. Also, presentedinTable6.1aretheparametersofthe 2+(1,0,0)stateforcomparison. The fit resulted in an RMS of the residuals of 25 MHz (0.00084 cm1), which is commensurate with the measurement uncertainty of the combined data set. The differencebetweentheobservedandcalculatedtransitionfrequencies(fitresiduals) for the 21/2(1,0,0,)2+(3,0,0)and 21/2(1,0,0)2+(0,0,0)bands are given in Table A.4 and A.5, respectively, in Appendix A.

Discussion The main goals of this study were to demonstrate the utility of laser-enhancement andFMspectroscopyformeasuringtransitionsoriginatingfromexcitedvibrational states, to identify the 2+(3,0,0)repumping transitions needed to laser cool and trap YbOH, and to determine the spectroscopic parameters of the 2+(3,0,0) state. The measured FM spectrum of the 21/2(1,0,0) 2+(3,0,0)band157 demonstrates that the chemical enhancement does indeed provide enough excited vibrationalstatepopulationfortransitionsoriginatingfromexcitedvibrationalstates tobeobserved. Additionally,theinbuffergascellFMabsorptiontechniqueprovides theneededsensitivitytoobservetheweak 21/2(1,0,0)2+(3,0,0)band. This combination of chemical enhancement and in cell FM absorption spectroscopy is a promising technique with which to measure transitions originating from excited vibrational states, in both YbOH and other molecules. The majority of the interest in the 21/2(1,0,0)2+(3,0,0)band of YbOH stems from its utility as a repumping pathway through which population lost to the 2+(3,0,0)state when laser cooling can be returned to the cooling cycle. Repumpingisaccomplishedbydrivingtherotationallyclosed12(1)and11(1) transitions 11[100]. While the analysis of the data assigned the11(1)line to the transition at 16337.2431 cm1, no assignment for the12(1)line was originally made. The prediction of the 21/2(1,0,0)2+(3,0,0)spectrum using the optimized parameters from Table 6.1 places the12(1)line at 16337.2342 cm1. The in-phase and in-quadrature FM data and simulated spectra in the region of the predicted12(1)line and the measured12(2),11(2)and11(1)lines are presented in Fig. 6.12. The simulated FM spectra were calculated using the optimized parameters from Table 6.1, a Gaussian FWHM linewidth of 108 MHz, a phase angle of 5.90 radians, and a temperature of 5 K. When comparing the prediction to the data, particularly the in-phase data, the12(1)line appears to be missing. However, upon closer examination, the asymmetry in the in-phase and in-quadrature positive and negative peak heights of the11(2)line as well as the small positive peak to the red of the11(2)line in the in quadrature data indicate thatthereisasmallspectralfeaturejusttotheredofandblendedwiththe11(2) feature. When fitting the data in this region to the FM lineshape model, fits both withandwithoutalinetoaccountforthissmallfeaturewereperformed(fitsto3or 4 spectral features). Adding a line to account for this small feature did not improve the fit. Therefore, a line accounting for this small blended feature was not added to thefitandnotransitionwavenumberwasassignedtothisfeature. Whenexamining theFMdataandthepredictionmadewiththeoptimizedparameters,particularlythe in-quadrature data and prediction, this small feature is almost directly overlapped with the predicted12(1)line. Therefore, even though the observed intensity is much smaller than the predicted intensity, this small feature can be assigned to 11Toachieverotationalclosureboththe12(1)and11(1)transitionsmustbesimultaneously driven.158 the12(1)transition. The blending of this feature with the much more intense 11(2)line precludes measurement of the transition frequency via fitting to the FM lineshape or by zero-crossing measurement. Instead the transition frequency wasmeasuredbynotingthatthemaximumofthepositivepeakofthein-quadrature signal is50.3 MHz to the red of the center of the Gaussian absorption lineshape. Using this method the12(1)line was assigned to 16337.2348\u00b10.0036cm1, which disagrees with the predicted value by 18 MHz (0.0006 cm1). The generous error of one average measured linewidth is given due to the approximate method used for measuring the transition frequency. The assigned valued of the12(1) and11(1)transitions can be immediately used for the implementation of laser cooling of YbOH. The combined fit of the 21/2(1,0,0) 2+(3,0,0)and 21/2(1,0,0) 2+(0,0,0)data sets allowed the parameters of the 2+(3,0,0)state to be de- termined for the first time.

This is in fairly good agreement with the measured value of 0.240795(4)cm1, especially considering the quadratic and higher-order terms in 2+(3,0,0)statedeterminedhereisnegative,asisthecase in the 2+(0,0,0)and was discussed in Section 4.3, the valueofisdominatedbysecond-ordercontributionswhichresultfromthemixing ofthe 2+statewithexcited21/2statesthroughthecombinationoftherotational and spin orbit interactions.

The same procedure can be used to estimate the contribution of the 21/2state to the value in the 2+(1,0,0)and 2+(3,0,0)states. We can again assume that the wavefunction of the 2+state can then be approxi- mated thehyperfine the odd isotopologues (see Section 5.5) indicate that||20.54,andassumingcontributionsfromotheratomicorbitals(e.g., 5) are small,<1%, gives||20.46.

Using these wavefunctions, the The FCFs,|||2, can be reliably estimated using the measured value of the stretchingvibrationalfrequency( 1=529.3269cm1),themeasuredbondlengths ((2+(0,0,0))=2.0397 and(21/2(0,0,0))=2.0062 ), and the harmonic approximation. The bending and O-H stretching modes can be ne- glected as the FCFs between them and the stretching (or (0,0,0)) states are neg- ligible. In the harmonic approximation, the energies of the 21/2state are ,=0(21/2(0,0,0,))+11. Using the values of ||2,||2,6, and 1indicated above, the measured value of 0(21/2(0,0,0))[116], the values ofand0=,given in Table 6.1, and the FCFs calculated in would adding in additional2states as those contribu- tions would be positive as well. As was discussed in Section 4.3, the negative values ofin the 2+state are most likely the result of perturbing states derived from a Yb+[]41362electronic configuration. These states have negative spin orbit parameters (e.g., 4<0for the20 7/2and20 5/2states of the Yb+ion [126]), which will result in negative contributions to . Using the above esti- mates and assuming that only the 21/2state and 41362states to gives;1=0(1362)=0.03032cm1,1=1(41362)=0.03106cm1, and1=3(41362)=0.03261cm1, where1(41362)indicates the sum ofthecontributionsto 1fromallelectronicstatesderivedfromthe 41362Yb+ atomic electronic configuration. The three gamma values presented in Table 6.1 indicate that the vibrational depen- dence ofin the 2+state is linear with respect to the stretching vibration, 1, with a slope of /10.001cm1. Additionally, the values of increase in magnitude with increased stretching vibration. This is in contrast to the vibrational dependence of the estimated 21/2state contributions to , which decrease in magnitudewithincreasingstretchingvibrationatalinearratewhichhasaslopethat is about five times smaller than the observed rate of change of the values. This further indicates that the determined values of in the 2+state can not be ac- countedforbyinteractionssolelywiththe 21/2stateandotherexcitedelectronic states must be involved. In addition to determining the parameters for the 2+(3,0,0)state, the combined fit of the with the previously measured values [116] and are more precisely determined, with the estimated errors a factor of 2/3 to 3 smaller. Thedeterminedvalueofthe -doublingparameter, +2,notonlyagrees with the previously determined value but is an order of magnitude more precise.161 12(2)11(1) 12(1)11(2) Figure 6.12: Measured and predicted FM 11(2)and11(1)transitions of the 21/2(1,0,0) 2+(3,0,0)band of 174YbOH.a.)Themeasuredin-phaseFMspectrum, ().b.)Thepredictedin- of174YbOH DispersedLIF(DLIF)measurementsofYbOHidentifiedseveralbandsintheregion regarding state preparation and readout of the 2+(0,1,0)science state.

The state at 17680 cm1was measured to have a branching ratio of 54.1% to the 2+(0,0,0) ground state and a branching ratio of 21.8% to the 2+(0,1,0)science state. The state at 17640 cm1was measured to have a branching ratio of 8.4% to the 2+(0,0,0)ground state and a branching ratio of 73.1% to the 2+(0,1,0) science state [135]. These branching ratio measurements indicate that both these stateshavestrongbendingcharacter 12andarecoupledtoboththegroundandscience states. Therefore, these states could prove useful for state preparation and readout, especially as optical pumping pathways for initial population of the 2+(0,1,0) science state. Finally, since these states are strongly coupled to the 2+(0,1,0) state, characterization of these excited states may aid in the spectroscopy of the 2+(0,1,0)science state. Experiment Sincethe[17.68]and[17.64]bandsareweakcomparedtotheoriginbandofYbOH, 100times weaker, in-cell FM absorption spectroscopy was used to measure the spectrumofthesebands. TheexperimentalFMsetupisnearlythesameasthatused for the FM absorption spectroscopy of the 21/2(1,0,0)2+(3,0,0)band, Section 6.5. The same buffer gas cell configuration as that described in Section 6.5 was used. Just as before, molecules were produced via ablation of a pressed stoichiometric Yb + Yb(OH) 3+ only the174YbOH isotopologue. 12The initial theory is that these states were some mixture of the 21/2(0,1,0)state and a perturbing state derived from the 41362Yb+electronic configuration.163 FM spectroscopy was performed using the same CW laser described in Section 6.4 and 6.5 with100W and110W of power for the [17.68]and[17.64] bands respectively. The laser was continuously scanned, and the signal from every consecutive7shotswereaveragedresultingin 10MHzstepsbetweendatapoints. The relative (and absolute) frequency between data points was monitored with a High Finesse wavemeter (WS7-30 VIS/Standard model). For the [17.68]data the phase shifter voltage was set to maximize (minimize) the in-phase (in-quadrature) FM signal, while for the [17.64]data the phase shifter voltage was set to split the FM signal evenly between the in-phase and in-quadrature channels. A portion of the FM absorption beam was picked off after passing through the buffer gas cell and directed into a DC photodiode to allow the simultaneous recording of both the FMandDCabsorptiondata. Asbefore,anormalizationprobefixedtothe11(0) line of the 21/2(0,0,0)2+(0,0,0)band was used to monitor shot-to-shot fluctuations inmolecular production. The spectrum ofboth bandswas co-recorded with the subdoppler saturated absorption spectrum of I 2. Measurements of the observed transitions frequencies of the [17.68]and[17.64] bandsweremadebymeasuringthefrequenciesofthezerocrossingsofthein-phase FM lineshapes 13. The error in the zero-crossing measurements was limited by the step size between the data points to 10 MHz. In this case, the zero crossing measurements were made using the High Finesse wavementer as the absolute and relativefrequencyreference. Therelativefrequencybetweendatapointsprovidedby the High Finesse wavementer is accurate. For other scenarios, absolute frequency calibration with the co-recorded I 2data results in the correction of the absolute frequency measured with the wavemeter by accounting for a general offset in fre- quencyof12\u00b13MHz. SincetheabsolutefrequencyrecordedbytheHighFinesse wavemeterwasusedforthetransitionfrequencymeasurements,eachmeasurement has an absolute frequency error of 12 MHz. However, since this error is common and the same for all measured transition frequencies, measured spacings between transition frequencies, such as those used for combination differences, are accu- rate and only limited by the error in the zero-crossing measurements themselves. From zero-crossing measurements a total of 65 and 62 transition frequencies were measured for the[17.68]and[17.64]bands respectively. The measured transition frequencies are listed in Table A.6 and A.7 in Appendix A. 13The transition frequencies measured via zero-crossing measurements are consistent with the transition frequencies measured via simultaneous fitting of the in-phase and in-quadrature FM data to the [17.68]band Themeasuredin-phaseFMspectrumofthe [17.68]bandispresentedinFig. 6.13.

Another plausible explanation for the gap in the spectrum is that the red and blue halves of the spectrum result from transitions to two different Renner- Tellercomponentsofanexcitedbendingstate. Anotherplausibleexplanationforthe observed spectral pattern is that the red half of the observed spectrum is primarily comprised of the =1,0andbranches with a red degraded bandhead and the blue half of the spectrum is comprised of the =0,1andbranches. [17.68]and 2+(0,0,0)combination differences In Ref. [135], the [17.68]band was assigned to a transition originating from the 2+(0,0,0)state and terminating in an excited vibronic state at 17680 cm1. If this assignment is correct then combination differences with the energy levels of the2+(0,0,0)state should allow the measured transitions to be assigned. The parameters of the 2+(0,0,0)state are well determined (Ch. 4 and [93]) and combinationdifferencesbetweenthecalculatedgroundstateenergylevelsandmea- sured[17.68]transition frequencies were determined 15. A total of 23 combination differences were found. Almost all of the combination differences were matches of the spin rotation splittings in the ground state to line splittings in the [17.68] spectrum. Ifthe[17.68]banddoesoriginatefromthe eters of the 2+(0,0,0)state the parameters of the excited state were varied. 15A combination difference in this case is when a splitting between two measured transition frequenciesmatchesanenergysplittingbetweentwolevelsinthe 2+(0,0,0)state. Acombination difference hit indicates that the two transitions originate from the pair of 2+(0,0,0)levels and terminate in the same excited state.165 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Wavenumber -17680 cm1 0.15 0.10 0.05 0.000.050.10Integrated In Phase FM SignalIn Phase [17.68] FM spectrum 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 2.25 2.50 2.75 3.00 Wavenumber -17680 cm1 0.15 0.10 0.05 0.000.050.10Integrated In Phase FM SignalIn Phase [17.68] FM spectrum: Red Half 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 Wavenumber -17680 cm1 0.15 0.10 0.05 0.000.050.10Integrated In Phase FM Phase [17.68] FM spectrum: Blue Half Figure 6.13: In-phase FM spectrum of the [17.68]band of174YbOH.

There is a clear pattern in both the red half and blue half of the spectrum with the combination difference matches increasing in ground state rotational level going to theredandtotheblueintheredhalfandbluehalfofthespectrumrespectively. Even though there are clear patterns in the combination differences, there are multiple anomalies as well. First, there were only a few combination differences involving spacings between different rotational levels in the ground state. Second, there are manystrongpairsoflinesthatwerenotinvolvedcombinationdifferencematches,as seen in Fig. 6.14. Lastly, there were no combination differences matches involving the=0and=1levels of the 2+(0,0,0)state. differences matches of line splittings from the [17.68] band and the level,,ofthe 2+(0,0,0)spin-rotationsplittingwhichmatchesthe [17.68]line splittings are indicated.

First,theextractedmolecularbeamisexposedtoadepletion laser (300 mW, elliptical shaped and multi-passed 10 times) which is resonant with a transition in the 21/2(0,0,0)2+(0,0,0)band that originates from the|,rotational/spin-rotational level of the 2+(0,0,0)state. The depletion laser is shuttered on and off for consecutive molecular pulses using a mechanical shutter so that the depletion laser is applied for every other molecular beam pulse. When the depletion laser is unblocked, it depletes the molecular population in the167 |,level of the 2+(0,0,0)state. Downstream from the depletion region, the molecular beam is exposed to a probe laser ( 700W) resonant with a transition inthe[17.68]bandandtheresultingLIFiscollectedanddetectedbyaPMT.Ifthe [17.68]transitionprobedbytheprobelaseroriginatesfromthesame |,levelof the2+(0,0,0)state depleted by the depletion laser, there will be a reduction in thedetectedprobeLIFwhenthedepletionlaserinunblockedascomparedtowhen thedepletionlaserisblocked.

Followingthedepletion,themolecularbeam passes through a probe beam, a laser beam resonant with a transition in [17.68] band. If the transition in the [17.68]band originates from the |,level of the2+(0,0,0)state, the fluorescence from the probe will be reduced when the depletion laser is on. The spin-rotation combination difference matches with the the ground state assignment from the combination differences, which line of the 21/2(0,0,0) 2+(0,0,0)band was used for depletion, and if depletion was seen. No depletion was seen for any of the [17.68] transitionsprobed,indicatingthatthecombinationdifferencesinvolvingthosetran- sitions are just happenstance. Table 6.2: Summary of state were made using the combination differences with the 2+(0,0,0)state. The 21/2(0,0,0) 2+(0,0,0)transitions were used for depletion. Line positions from Ref. [116]. Discussion of[17.68]measurements Theabsenceofdepletionconfirmsthatthecombinationdifferencematchesinvolving the=2and=3spinrotationsplittingsinthe 2+(0,0,0)stateareincorrect. Therefore, there are no combination difference matches with any of the =0 3levels of the 2+(0,0,0)state in the[17.68]spectrum. This also puts the other spin-rotation splitting matches into question. The lack of depletion, incorrect combination differences, and a lack of combination differences involving splittings betweendifferentrotationallevelsinthe 2+(0,0,0)state,providestrongevidence169 that the[17.68]band does not originate from the 2+(0,0,0)state as previously assigned [135]. Therefore, the combination difference matches found between the[17.68]splittings and the 2+(0,0,0)state energy levels are just due to happenstance. The group of Michael Heaven confirmed that the [17.68]band does indeed belong to YbOH, as opposed to a contaminant such as YbO or YbOCH 3, with resonant enhancedmulti-photonionization(REMPI)spectroscopy 16. Therefore,the[17.68] band likely originates from an excited state in YbOH, most likely an excited vibra- tionallevelofthe 2+state. splittings in higher vibrational states will have different rotational constants. Additionally, all of the accidental spin rotation splitting matches indicate that the ground state of the [17.68]band should have a spin-rotation splitting (or other splitting) similar to that of the 2+(0,0,0)state. The spin-rotation splittings of the 2+(0,1,0)state are expected to be similar to that of the 2+(0,0,0)state. Additionally, the bending angular momentum in the 2+(0,1,0)state results in a reduced spin-rotation splitting in the =1state (there is no=0state), see Section 2.7. The spin-rotation splitting for higher asymptotically approaches the linear case with increasing . This would account forthelackofaccidental =1and=0spin-rotationmatchesinthecombination differences. All this points to the [17.68]band originating from a 2+(0,1,0) ground state. Theexperimentalmeasurementsofthe [17.68]bandpresentedheresuggestthatthe [17.68]band is actually a transition from the 2+(0,1,0)state an excited vi- bronicstateat18000cm1(herecalledthe[18.00]state),0\u00002+(0,1,0)\u0001=319 cm1[135]. This tentative re-assignment 17could be consistent with the previous DLIF measurements as the decay from [18.00] 2+(0,0,0)would be over- lapped with the decay of the strong3110atomic Yb transition at 17992.007 cm1which was excited by the amplified stimulated emission of the pulsed dye laser [135]. Experiments aimed at confirming this assignment by measuring DLIF to the blue of the excitation of the [17.68]band at 17680 cm1with a cw laser are currently underway. 16Private communication from Michel Heaven. 17Arian Jadbabaie played a significant role in determining this assignment.170 FM spectroscopy of be three distinct sections in the [17.64]spectrum: a section to the red (second panelfromtopinFig. 6.16)whichiscomprisedofthestrongestandmostcongested lines which resemble a red degraded bandhead; a middle section (third panel from top in Fig. 6.16) which is comprised of four weak doublets; and a section to the blue (bottom panel in Fig. 6.16).

There also is a weak line to the red of the red section of the spectrum that may be one on the low lines of abranch. Just as with the[17.68]state, combination differences as well, though many of them contradicted each other. Additionally, there are several strong and several weak lines which had no combination difference matches. Ultimately, no definitive assignments were made using the combination differences.

As with the [17.68]band we believe that this lack of depletion and assignments from the combination differences indicate that the [17.64]band may also originate from the 2(0,1,0)state. However, this claim is slightly more speculative than that made about the [17.68]state as a depletion measurement of only one line in the [17.64]band was taken.171 8 9 10 11 12 13 Wavenumber -17630 cm1 0.2 0.1 0.00.10.2Integrated In Phase FM SignalIn Phase [17.64] FM spectrum 8.00 8.25 8.50 8.75 9.00 9.25 9.50 9.75 10.00 Wavenumber -17630 cm1 0.2 In Phase [17.64] FM spectrum: Red In FM spectrum: Blue Section Figure6.16: In-phaseFMabsorptionspectrumofthe [17.64]band.

These experimental efforts are still a work in progress, and I will defer detailed discussions of these efforts to the future dissertations and manuscripts of my col- leagues, who will perform this work. However, to provide a larger context for the work described here, I will conclude by providing a brief overview of the current status of these experiments as well as some \"lessons learned\" which may be of benefit to future students. The NMQM apparatus The 4 K CBGB source described in this dissertation will serve as the molecular source for the NMQM experiment, providing cold, high-intensity beams of YbOH molecules. Atthetimeofwriting,initialspinprecessiontestsonthegroundstateof YbOHhavebeenperformedinthebeamextensionregionofthe4KCBGBsource 1.

The shields will soon be integrated with the 4 K CBGB source and NMQM science chamber. Ongoing and future spectroscopy As described in this dissertation, many of the prerequisite spectroscopic studies of YbOHhavealreadybeencompleted. Characterizationofthe 2+(0,1,0)science state, which is critical for future eEDM and NMQM measurements with YbOH, is currently underway. At the time of writing, this state has been observed in the 4 K CBGBsourcebydrivingtheextremelyweak,symmetry-forbidden 21/2(0,0,0) 1These tests were carried out by Arian Jadbabaie and Yuiki Takahashi. 2The selections were made in collaboration with Arian Jadbabaie and Chandler Conn. 3The magnetic shields 2+(0,1,0)band, whichis1000timesweakerthanthe 21/2(0,0,0)2+(0,0,0)originband, isenabledbyaseriesoftechnicalfeaturesofthe4KCBGBsource.

State preparation, readout, and spin precession In order to perform an eEDM or NMQM experiment, transitions which can be uti- lized for state preparation and readout must also be characterized. To be utilized for state preparation or readout, a transition must originate from the 2+(0,1,0) state. The[17.68]and[17.64]bands recorded in this work may be used for state preparation and readout. Though transition assignments and the molecular param- eters of the states involved in these transitions were not determined here, this work provides extremely compelling evidence that these states do not originate from the 2+(0,0,0)state, as previously assigned. Instead we expect these transitions to originate from the 2+(0,1,0)state. Experiments to definitively determine174 this are currently being designed. Additionally, if these transitions do originate from the 2+(0,1,0)state, then combination differences with the energy levels of the 2+(0,1,0)state will allow the assignment of the spectral features. Com- bination differences using the initial estimates of the molecular parameters of the 2+(0,1,0)state are promising, but tentative. When designing state preparation and readout schemes, the energy levels of the molecular state must be accurately modeled in magnetic and electric fields. To achievethis,themolecularparametersofthestateinquestionmustbeknowntohigh precision. The parameters of the 2(0,0,0)state of174YbOH were determined to high precision in Ch. 4 and used to design the state preparation and readout schemes in the initial spin precession tests mentioned above. The parameters of the2+(0,0,0)and 21/2(0,0,0)states of173YbOH were determined at high resolution in Ch. 5. These parameters can be used to implement initial ground state spin precession tests with173YbOH, as well as estimate the parameters of the 173YbOH bending mode for prototyping and simulating NMQM state preparation and readout. Laser cooling of YbOH In order to achieve order of magnitude improvements in future eEDM sensitivity, both high flux and long coherence times will be needed. The PolyEDM collabo- ration aims to achieve this with the direct laser cooling and trapping of polyatomic molecules. One-dimensional laser cooling of YbOH [54] has been demonstrated by our PolyEDM collaborators in the Doyle group at Harvard. Three-dimensional optical trapping and sub-doppler cooling have been demonstrated for the lighter, isoelectronic, triatomic CaOH [60]. In of YbOH, the photon budget was500,whichwasaccomplishedbydrivingthe 21/2(0,0,0)2+(0,0,0) transition, for which the PPMODR measurements of the 2+(0,0,0)state are detailed in Ch. 4, and repumping vibrational losses out of the 2+(1,0,0), 2+(2,0,0), and 2+(0,20,0)states. High resolution DLIF measurements of combination with quasi-diabatic ab initio vibronic calculations, [107] indicate that vibrational losses to the 2+(0,1,0),2+(1,1,0),2+(1,20,0), and 2+(3,0,0)states must be addressed in order to scatter 10,000photons. The FM spectroscopy of the 21/2(1,0,0)2+(3,0,0)band, recorded here (Ch. 6), identified the repumping transitions for the 2+(3,0,0)state. This FM175 study also demonstrated the utility of the FM technique for measuring repumping transitions. Additionally, this study confirmed that the laser-enhanced chemical reactionsdoindeedprovidelargepopulationsofexcitedvibrationalstatesonwhich spectroscopycanbeperformed. ThisFMtechniqueandthechemicalenhancement will allow the other repumping transitions to be identified quickly and efficiently. This technique is not exclusive to YbOH and can be utilized to identify repumping transitions for other molecules as well. The negative spin rotation parameters of the 2+(0,0,0)and 2+(3,0,0)states determinedinthisworkindicatetheexistenceofperturbingstatesinYbOHderived from a Yb+41362electronic configuration. The isoelectronic molecule YbF contains states of this nature as well [122, 124, 158], and energies involved in the laser-enhanced chemical reactions are larger than the energies of these perturbing states, the chemical enhancement may naturally provide the needed population on which the spectroscopy can be performed. Finally,whilethefirst-generationNMQMexperimentwillbeperformedinabeam, future generations may benefit from the enhanced state preparation and readout ef- feciency and longer coherence times provided by photon cycling and laser cooling. Themeasurementsofthe 21/2(0,0,0)2+(0,0,0)transitionsoftheoddiso- topologueshaveenabledrotationallyclosedphotoncyclingtransitionsin171YbOH and173YbOH to be identified. At the time writing, rotationally closed photon cycling in the171YbOH and173YbOH isotopologues has been accomplished 4. 4The work implementing photon cycling in the odd isotopologues was carried out by Yi Zeng.176 A p p e n d i x A Measured YbOH Transitions This appendix provides lists of all the YbOH transitions measured or used in this work.177 A.1 PPMODR spectroscopy.
