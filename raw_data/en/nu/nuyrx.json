Good morning.Today we are holding a hearing, the fourth in a series on the child immunization program. Today we are going to focus on the Hawkins bill, Senate 2117, the National Childhood Vaccine-InjuryCompensation Act.Out of necessity, this hearing will focus on the costs and regula- tory burden that might be imposed by this legislation. But, toremind us why this legislation is necessary, I would first like to show a short video presentation produced by Wendy Scholl of Flori-da. a witness at an earlier hearing. This tape shows pictures ofchildren in Florida who suffered injuries due to apparent adversereactions to vaccines.Would you show that, please?[Whereupon, a video tape was viewed.]Senator HAWKINS. Thank you.My intent in sponsoring this legislation and holding these hear-ings is not to frighten i.arents away from immunizing their chil-dren against childhood diseases, nor is it to assess any blame. My intent is simply to improve our Nation's immunization program so that it better achieves its original goal of safeguarding ot.:r chil- dren's health.Our previous hearings identified a number of areas that need to be addressed: the general childhood immunization program; the in- creasing costs of the vaccines; and the findings of the Federal taskforce report on pertussis, the most controversial of the seven child- hood vaccines. Testimony presented at those earlier hearings dem-onstrated the need for a better vaccine for pertussis, the need tocontinue our search for safer and more effective vaccines, the needfor a better recordkeeping system, the need for a better system ofreporting adverse reactions to vaccines as well as incidences of theactual disease, the need for better communication between parentIi) and physician. and the need for a better method of compensatingthose few childreninjured by adversereactionsto childhoodvaccines.The legislation we are considering today addresses all of theseneeds. Although compensation of toe injured children is a key com-ponent of S. 2117, the other provisions of this bill are of equal im-portance, perhaps more important, because they are designed toimprove the entire immunization program to prevent the injuriesin the first place.These provisions include mandatory recordkeeping by the healthprofessional of the date, dosage, vaccine manufacturer, and lotnumber for each immunization given; mandatory reporting of ad-verse reactions occurringwithin a specified period of time follow-ing immunization; required studies of the relationship between vac-cination and certain illnesses, injuries, and conditions; developmentof tests or procedures to determine categories of children who maybe particularly susceptible to an adverse reaction; and development of parent information hiatrials on the risks of vaccination, therisks ofthe disease's, and what reactions and signs the parentshould monitor and report to the physician.Despit,the tremendous progress that we have made in safe-guarding ot,.:..idren against deadly childhood diseases, we cannotafford to be copyiiwent. Too many children have died, and toomany have beenfrom adverse reactions to the vaccines aswell as the. diseases tilcinselves. Too many parents have lost faithin our vaccination program.I think inaction is what we should fear, not steps designed to im-prove the childhood immunization program. Without our health. and our children's healthwe have nothing, With it, we have thepotential for everything.Before we hear from the first panel of witnesses, we will receivefor the record the prepared statements of Senator Hatch, chairmanof the full committee, and Senators Kennedy, Grassley, and Thur-mond.'The statements of Senators Hatch. Kennedy, Grassley, andThurmondOPENINC STATEMENT 01\" SENATOR HATCHSenator HATCH. I am pleased to see full Labor and Human Re-source Committee hearings today to address a small but significant public health problemthe incidence of harmful and occasionallyeven fatal reactions to vaccines administered to children. As we discuss unfort.mate incidence of harm resulting from vaccines,hope we will notlose sight of the miracle which has been fromtheir usechildhood immunization is perhaps the single roost successfulpublic health effort in the history of the world. Widespread epide-mics of common childhood diseases were once fatal to tens of thou-sands of infants arid children every year. Thanks to immunizationprograms. such disasters are not history. sadly. the great success of immunization programs is not fullyappreciated by the general public and perhaps not even by re.,earchers Our public health officials must combat parental laxity in getting children immunized. On the other hand, insufficient re-search focus has been placed on the elimiLating of adverse reac-tions to vaccines. For example, we need to learn about the inci-dence of side effects and how we can prevent them happening inthe future.As we consider these very real problems, I want to make certainthat our doubts and fears about immunization not overshadow thegreat benefits that have resulted from widespread immunization ofchildren. I believe it would be a tragedy if our citizens were to losefaith in public vaccination programs which have been so importantand effective in saving lives and improving health.I want to commend my colleague, Senator Hawkins, for her in-terest and leadership in our childhood immunization program. Shehas spent many months investigating issues related to vaccine-re-lated injuries and how we might manufacture safer vaccines. Shehas also developed legislation to provide compensation for victimsof vaccine-related injury. On November 17, 1983, she introducedthe National Childhood Vaccine-Injury Compensation Act (S. 2117).This legislation was developed in conjunction with physicians andparents of vaccine-injured children, and is a first step in the devel-opment of a method of compensation for such injuries.As these hearings proceed, I welcome the opportunity to learnmore about issues related to this legislation. There is conflictingdata on the cost of S. 2117, there are differing opinions on how wemight finance compensation, and concerns about qualifications forsuch compensation. Therefore, I welcome our witnesses today andlook forward to their testimony. I hope they will provide us withimportant information we will need to thoroughly consider thisissue.OPENINC STATEMENT OF SENATOR KENNEDYSenator KENNEDY. Madam Chairman, today the Labor Commit-tee meets to consider a very important issue, the question ofwhether the Congress should enact legislation which would createa National Childhood Vaccine Compensation Program. There ap-pears to be a growing concern among professionals, parents and ad-ministrators that some type of vaccine injury compensation pro-gram is necessary. We must preserve our national policy that avaccination program is an excellent way to reduce the frequency ofa number of infectious diseases and to avoid the many ill effectsthose diseases bring upon theft victims. In =addition, to the obviousquestion of avoiding the pain and suffering that infectious diseasescause, there is the additional consideration of reducing the costs in-curred by diseases that may be preventable; clearly, given the highcost of health care in America today, any mechanism which re-duces the need for hospitalization, reduces the cost of treatmentand rehabilitation and reduces the cost and sorrow of death, is wel-c(aneIli wever. we have come to recogniw that despite the overwhelm-ing social benefits derived from our childhood immunization pro-;rram. there arc obvious and painful costs. Even when vaccines areproperly manufactured. distributed and administered, there will bea case of paralytic polio which will result from the administration 4of each r) million doses of polio vaccine; there will be a serious neu-rological injury which will result from every 300,000 doses of DTPvaccine, and in rare cases there are severe consequences from theadministration of MMR vaccines. These few but important injuriescreate doubts and fears in our National Childhood Vaccination Pro-grams, doubts and fears that erode the confidence of caring par- ents. These few, injuries also create the threat of substantial liabil- ity for the tianufacturers and distributors of our Nation's supply ofvaccine.We live in an imperfect world. There is no such thing as certain-ty in the delivery of medical treatments, and there is no such thing as certainty in the administration of our Nation's vaccination pro- grams. I do not think that we can insist on a vaccination program that guarantees no injuries and no consequences. If we requiredthat kind of assurance, we would rarely do anything to protect thehealth of the American people. I made this observation 5 years agoas the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Re- '.'arch when we considered liability issues associated with the swine influenza immunization program, and 1 repeat it here.We would sacrifice much that is good in the pursuit of the per-fect. However, we cannot ignore the pains and suffering of thosefew but inevitable victims of our national immunization program.We cannot ignore those parents who have doubts and fears.We must be able to get vaccines to children in the right time andplace, at an acceptable cost and without creating exorbitant andunpredictable legal difficulties. We must be able to assure parentsthat when their children are the victims of an appropriate and ra-tional national policy, a compassionate Government will assistthem in their hour of need. We cannot tolerate a system which dis-courages immunization, increases the risks to the very children in need of protection, and encourages litigation within a tort systemwhich awards few handsomely and sends others equally aggrievedaway penniless.On the other hand, we should not propose a system which is eco-nomically and politically unreasonable. We -:annot ignore the factsuch a proposed system would benefit no one.Today, the Labor Committee will hear the honest and candidcomments of our witnesses. I am sure that the answers they pro-vide iind the questions that they raise will help us to develop a na-tional vaccine injury compensation program that is fair, equitableand reasonable.OVENINC STATEMENT (U SENATOR GRASSI,E1'Senator GRAssi,E. I want to commend Senator Hawkins for herefforts to bring systematic and responsible attention to the issue of vaccine-related injuries. The three previous hearings she has heldon this topic have identified a number of goals we should strive toachieveFirst. We should strive to maintain public confidence in our in-munizat in programs. As a number of witnesses stated at earlierbearings. arid as I believe some of today's witnesses will also state,immuni/ation of children has been spectacularly successful. Ane mber of hh-taking children's diseases have either been eiiminat- ed or all but eliminated as a result of our immunization programs. Furthermore, knowledgeable parties agree that, for individuals. thebenefits of immunization outweigh the risks involved. It is impor-tant to make this point because many younger parents may haveno memory of the devastating effects which epidemics of childhooddiseases can have. Physicians who participate and who competentlyfollow currently accepted practice must be able to feel confidentthat they will not be censured or sued as a consequence of their part ici pat ion.Second, although the incidence of adverse effect is very low, we :should sutsify ourselves that we are doing all that it is possible to do to eliminate all adverse effects of vaccines. One important prior.ity should be to develop better, safer, vaccines. A second importantpriority should be to try to be sure that parents and physicians are well informed about the possible risks involved, and particularlyabout symptoms of adverse vaccine reaction, so that remedial steps can be taken immediately if a recipient appears to have adverse re-actions.Third, we should satisfy ourselves that we are doing all that it ispossible to do to improve our knowledge of the extent, patterns,and causes of adverse reactions to vaccines. There appears to be a concern in some quarters at the present time that we do not havereliable knowledge about the extent, patterns, and causes of such adverse reactions. Itis argued that this; is partially a problem ofinadequate recording of data about such vaccines and vaccinations,and partially a problem of inadequate reporting about adverse re- actions. The establishment of causal relationships between particu-lar vaccines and adverse reactions they might engender is very im- portant also. Apparently at present a temporal association is theusual basis for concluding that a particular child might have expe- rienced a vaccine -caused episode. Cl_early, and particularly if thiscommittee wishes to consider a Vaccine Injury Compensation Pro-gram. we should satisfy ourselves that enough is being done to helpus better understand the causal relationships between acverseevents and vaccines. A temporal association is not enough.Fourth, we have to ask ourselves whether our present system ofcompensating people who are injured by vaccines is equitable andreasonablethat it compensates in a fair and timely way in those cases where itis unambiguously dotilonstrated that a particularvaccine caused damage. In all of our States, vaccination is requitedbefore a child will be allowed to enter public school. Federal, State,and local government officials urge all parents to immunize theirchildren. For all practical purposes, immunization programs have bet.ome obligatory. Should a child sustain injury as a consequence of such an immunization program, it hardly seems fair that that child or its parents should sustain tne entire burden of.the conse- quences which may follow.Our present system may also hav( contributed, through large li-ability awards. to raising vaccine prices, and to causing Americancompanies to leave the field of vaccine production. Just how impor-tant liability awards have been in causing these effects is not clear.But in army case. ltis therefore argued that some sort of compensa-tion program is a goed idea: that creation of such a program wouldhelp relieve tIn hordes on children who sustain injury and their 6families, and help ensure that American manufacturers continueto produce vaccines.S. 2117 is an effort to achieve some of these goals. I look forwardto the testimony the committee will take today for the help it cangive us in deciding whether everything that should be done onthese problems is being done, and, if not, whether S. 2117 lays outthe best ways to proceed.OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR THURNIONDSenator THURMOND. Madam Chairman, it is a pleasure to receivetestimony today concerning S. 2117, the National Childhood Vac-cine-Injury Compensation Act.Madam Chairman, one of the most significant achievements ofscience and medicine in the last century has been the developmentof vaccines which protect our children from a number of devastat-ing diseases. While itis true that adverse reactions occasionallyoccur in vaccine recipients, it is impossible to measure the pain and suffering that has been avoided through the immunization ofchild ren.I want to commend Senator Hawkins for her recognition of theproblems experienced by those who Suffer adverse reactions to vac-cines and their families, and for her efforts to address those prob-lems through the legislation we will consider today.However, I have reviewed the prepared testimony of Dr. Brandtfor this hearing and I believe he has raised some very importantquestions and concerns about S. 2117. Dr. Brandt's most seriousconcerns relate to the broad list of compensable conditions includedin the bill and the level of payments established by the bill.So, I look forward to the discussion today of these issues and tothe testimony of pH the distinguished witnesses who will testify.Senator HAWKINS. I would like to welcome Dr. Brandt back withus today, and Dr. Mason and Dr. Hinman to the hearing today. Ibelieve this is the third time that Dr. Hinman has testified beforeour committee on this issue of childhood immunization, but I thinkwe are making progress with each hearing.Dr. Brandt, we would like to begin with you, please.STATEMENT OF EDWARD M. BRANDT, JR., M.D., ASSISTANT SEC-RETARY OF' HEALTH, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ANI; HUMANSERVICES, ACCOMPANIED BY DR. JAMES 0. MASON, DIRECTOR,('ENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL; ANI) DR. ALAN HINMAN, IM-MINIZATION DIVISION, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROLDr. BRANDT. Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.With your permission, I would like to submit my entire testimo-ny for the record, and only summarize it here.Immunization of children i3 one of the most spectacularly suc-cessful preventive health measures available. Through the appro-priate use of vaccine, smallpox has been eradicated from the earth.In this country we have also essentially eliminated diphtheria, tet-anus, and poliomyelitis as diseases of children. We are en the vergeof achieving elimination of measles as a native disease and are be-ginning to intensify our efforts in order to hasten the ultimateelimination of rubella.11 These achievements have had a dramatic impact on the morbidi- ty that used to be considered an inevitable part of growing up. 'rhousands of childrenare now alive and well who would have diedof these diseases if our modern vaccines had riot been developed. Current vaccines are both safe and effective. However, they are neither perfectly safe nor perfectly effective. Occasionally they will fail to provide the protection desired, and occasionally they cause something not desiredan adverse reaction. The challenge in vac- cine development is to maximize efficacy while minimizing the risk of adverse effects. This balancing of benefits and risks is complicat- ed by the difficulties in establishing a causal relationship between the administration ofa vaccine and the occurrence of an adverseeA wide array of conditions,many with severe or fatal conse- quences, may affect children. Many of these are of unknown cause. Since almostallinfantsreceivevaccines during these same months, it is inevitable thatsome of these conditions will occur intemporal association with receipt of a vaccine, although not caused by the vaccination. It is equally true that properly manufactured and administered vaccinescan, on occasion, cause unavoidabledamage. Despite careful study of individual circumstances, itis often impossible to state with certainty whether or not vaccine has actually played a role in the development of an aaverse event. It is appropriate, therefore, to be cautious in ascribing a causal role to the vaccine in individualcases unless studies have clearly demon-strated that an excess number of such adverse conditions occur among vaccine recipients.We are very concerned about the problem of vcncine-associated injuries and are eager to minimize their occurrence. We have es- tablished an interagency work group to monitor vaccine develop- ment. production, and usage. We have carried out or funded sever- al studies concerning vaccine reactions, and these, of course, were summarized in a report submitted to you, Madam Chairman, last year.We have established a monitoring system for adverse events fol- lowing immunization in the ublic sector at the CDC, and the FDA continues to receive reports from the private sector.Although the occurrence of adverse events following immuniza- tion can he minimized,itcannot be eliminated entirely. Thus,there will always hea small number of individuals who areharmed by the vaccines that protect our society. S. 2117 addresses an important issue--compensation for individuals who are injured as a result of receiving vaccines which are universally recommend-ed and often required by State laws. The bill has a laudable goal and in general seems to reflect recommendations that have been made to the Department over the past several years by many dif- ferent groups. However, the bill has major weaknesses which make itimpossible to support. Of special concern are the broad list of compensable conditions, the level of payment established, and the retroactivity provisions. These factors interrelate to provide a sig- nificant disincentive to childhood vaccination programs. In my pre- pared testimony I discuss all of these concerns in more detail. Our major concern about the list of compensable conditions is that the bill establishes a strong presumption that vaccine is re- 12 Ksponsible fur essentially any adverse condition that happens afterimmunization unless there is incontrovertible evidence of othercausation. This presumptiOn of guilt would undermine public confi-dence, in immunizations.Furthermore, the criteria for qualificat'nn are broad enough topermit compensation in a wide variety of circumstances includingsituations in which the relationship of the vaccine to the injury isnot clear.We also have given so:-ne examples, Madam Chairman, of '...ompu-tations of the compensation, and, in addition, would point out thatthe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the cost of thisbill to the Federal Treasury, not including the increase in the costof the vaccine doses, for the first 3 years would be approximately$4.9 billion.As to retroactivity, the bill provides that any designated eventwhich occurred before enactment would also automatically be eligi-ble for compensation. Given the lack of specificity of eligibility cri-teria, one can envision a number of situations as outlined in thetestimony.There are numerous additional problems with the program thatthis bill would establish, and I have mentioned some of them in thetestimony.Madam Chairman, this is a very complicated area. It is one thatdoes demand some sort of solution, and one in which it is obviousthat there is not a single simple solution.We are not convinced that a Federal program is needed to ac-complish this. As well-intentioned as S. 2117 is, its provisions, inour view, complicate an already complex situation rather than helpto resolve it. For these reasons, he administration opposes the bill.Wecontinue, however, to work with this committee on the im-portant policy issues addressed by this legislation.Iand my colleagues wouid be nappy, Madam Chairman, toanswer any questions.'The prepared statement of Dr. Brandt follows:] 3 9 DEPARTMENT OF HEA'-11114. HUMAN SERVICES Pubhc HS&th SIMMS STATEMENT OF EDWARD N. BRANDT, JR., M.D.ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICEU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCESUNITED STATES SENATE MAY3,1984 14Washmpton DC 20201 10 Mr.'airman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to appear before you today to discuss S. 2117, the \"National Childhood Vaccine-Injury Compensation Act.\"1 am accompanied by Di. James Mason, Director of the Centers for Disease Control, and Dr. Alan Hinman, Director of the Division of Imminisation of the Centers for Disease Control. Immunisation of children is one of thu most spectacularly successfulpreventive health measures available. Through the appropriate use of vaccine, smallpox has been eradicated from the earth. In this country we have alsoessentially eliminated diphtheria, tetanus, and poliomyelitis as diseases of children.We are on the verge of achieving elimination of measles as native dse and are beginning to intensify our efforts in order to hasten the ultimate elimination of rubella. These achievements have had a dramatic impact on the morbidity that used to be considered an inevitable part of growing up.Thousands of children arenow alive and well who would have died of these dsea if our modern vaccines had not been developed. Current vaccines are both safe and effective. However, they are neither perfectly safe nir perfectly effective. Therefore, occasionally they will fail to provide that which is desired (protection), and occasionally they will cause something that is not desired (an adverse reaction). The challenge in vaccine development is to maximize efficacy while minimizing the rink of adverse effects.Aftervaccine is licensed and put into use, it is also important to maintain surveillance to ensure that the benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh the risks. This balancing of benefits and risks is complicated by the difficulties in establishing a causal reimtionship between the administration of a vaccine end the occurrence of an adverse event. 5 11 The months at infancy and early childhood are fraught with a multitude ofdangers.An array of conditions, many with severe or fatal consequences, mayaffect children. Many of these conditions are of unknown cause. Since almostall infants receive vaccines during these same months, itis inevitable thatsome of these conditions will occur in temporal association with receipt of avaccine, although not caused by the vaccination. It is equally true thatproperly manufactured and administered vaccines Can, on occasion, causeunavoidable damage. Despite careful study of iLoividual circumstances, it isoften impossible to state with certainty whether or not vaccine has actuallyplayed a role in the development of an adverse event. Since virtually alladverse conditions associated with vaccination also occur unrelated to ye/ciliation, itis appropriate to ba cautious in ascribing a causal role tothe vaccine unless studies have clearly demonstrated that an excess number ofsuch adverse conditions occur among vaccine recipients.i Itis not clear what proportion of current vaccine prices is made up of thecurrent and anticipated future costs of vaccine injury claims and litigation.Tables 1and 2, which Iam including with the written testimony, indicate theper-dose cos: of different vaccines in the public and private sectors and gives.mr estimate of the magnitude of the childhood vaccine market in the UnitedStates atpresent.In summary, we estimate the total childhood vaccine market inStates to he arproximately $14b million per year we are very concerne0 about the problem of vaccine-associated injuries and areeagerminimize their occurrence. We have established an interagency workt' monitor vaccine development, production, and usage. We have carriedo\"t or funded several studies concerning vaccine reactions; those weresummarized in a report sohmrtted to Senator Hawkins last year. We have 12 established a monitoring system for adverse events following immunizatio, in the public sector at the Centers for Disease Control, and the Food and Drug Administration continues to receive reports from the private sector. Information from these systems is used to help us evaluate the significance of events which occur following the receipt of vaccines.Recently, the Public Health Service Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) modified its recommendations about the use of pertussis vaccine in infants and children who have previously had convulsions, based largely on data from the CDC monitoring system.Since no vaccine is totally without some risks, this continued balancing of the risks and benefits of immunizations is essential and is an integral part of our activities. To try to assure parental understanding of itsk4 and benefits of vaccines, we have developed and implemented in the public sector a series of \"Important Information Statements\" designed to present the mst important facts concerning vaccines. These forms are updated Altn..0 the occc,rrence of adverse events following immunization can be minimized,it cannot he eliminated entirely. Thus, there will always be a ,1,0,er ofindividuals who are harmed by the vaccines that protect our s., ietv.S.l.117 addresses an important issue-- compensation for individuals al, intured as a result of receiving vaccines which are universally re. .mmnded and often required by State laws. It establishes a mechanism by whirl an injured party can receive compensation without having to prove naglix.nce.It guarantees that those who experience certain designated events will r.eiv compensation for medical expenses, special education and rekailitat tun, forgone wages, and pain and suffering, The bill has a la efa!,le goal and in general seems to reflect recommendations that have been made t. the Department over the past several years by many different groups. 17 13 including national immunization work group* and the American Academy ofPediatrics.however, the bill also has major weaknesses which make itImpossible to support. Of special concern are the broad list of compensableconditions. the level of payment established, and the retroactivityprovisions.These factors interrelate to provide a significant disincentiveto childhood vaccine programs. I will discuss each of these concerns briefly. 1.The list of compensable conditions. The bill establishes a list ofacute events covered and the time period in which these must occur inrelation to vaccination in order for the vaccine recipient to qualifyfor compensation. The event must require hospitalization and incurexpenses of atleast $2,500, or must involve the death of the recip-ient.Although some of the conditions proposed in the bill have beentemporally associated with receipt of pertuasis-containing vaccine,scientific consensus does not exist that all of these conditions arecaused by the vaccine and likely to lead to permanent damage. Seriousquestions remain both about immediate causation of these conditionsand the relationship of these conditions to sequelae. !Ead.iiiin, the bill is so vague as to allow virtually any eventtoliovirit; one of the listed events to be considered as causally:elated.The bill establishes a strong presumption that the vaccine I-responsible for essentially any adverse condition that happensafter immunisation unless there is incontrovertible evidence of otherThis presumption of guilt would undermine public ;1,aInI rnmul 17at1 MIS . t,t44ii.1Iv 14 \"vaccine injury\" table occur reistivelycommonly after receipt of pertussis-contsining vaccine. Table 3 summarizes the estimated annual frequency of events listed as compensable in the bill. An unknown but substantial proportion of those events likely would meet the criterion of hospitalization with medical expenses totalling $2,500. The level of compensation that would be awarded to these individuals cannot be estimated with certainty.Given the current level of medical costs and the incentivewhiiti may be posed by the existence of the compensation system, it seems likely that a substantial proportion of persons with these conditions might be hospitalized (sometimes unnecessarily) and incur expenses in excess of $2,500. The criteria for qualification are broad enough to permit compensation in a wide variety ofcircumstances, including situations in which the relationship of the vaccine to the injury is not clear. For example, the bill could potentially allow for compensation of a child who had a simple febrile seizure before immunization if the child had a similar febrile seizure after immunization and subsequently had two further febrile seizures within the next year. Allitionally, the \"other appropriate factors\" to be taken into consideration to determine compensation include prolonged sleeping wits difficulty arousing, a condition practically impossible to define onierttvelv.A single fever of 105\u00b0F accompanied by irritability (rutfurther spyttfied) would also be viewed as compensable.Finally, trsh,old be noted that the manifestation must not necessarily have been rrcot.;ntzed or recorded within the timeframe specified but could 19 15 be inferred to have occurred. This createsgreat possibility forinaccurate recollec..ion of events. The bill also indicates that any\"significant worsening of preexisting condition will be treated thesame as ifit wire evidence of a newly arising condition.\" Thus, achild who had convulsion before vaccination as a result of someorganic brain damage, and subsequently had worsening of that conditionas a result of the natural progression of the disease, might havereceived a dose of vaccine within 7 days before having one of theconvulsions.This bill would encourage considering that the entirecondition was brought about by vaccination. An infant recognized tohave a serious progressive neurological disorder might be vaccinatedand thug hecome eligible for compensation for the expensive care andmaintenance needed by the child for a preexisting condition notaffected by vaccination. 2.Compensation levels. The levels of compensation specified in the tillinclude amount[ which are apparently designed to make the compensationsystem an attractive alternative to the tort system, Although listedas maximums, these values seem likely to become the norm. Inaddition, 3100,000 could routinely be awarded to each injured partyfor \"pain, suffering, and emotional distress\" in addition to the othercosts which are listed. The bill mandates, rather than simplypermits, award for pain and suffering. Coupling this with theallowable attorney's fees (20-25 percent depending on whether or notthere is an appeal) and the extremely broad definition of compensableevents, the costs of this bill would be enormous, far outweighing thecurrent costs of illness truly cau sed by vaccine. The surtax 20 16 (proposed as the mechanist of financing the compensation) subsequently imposed on vaccines could render t:mir price prohibitive. Table 4 lists the range of estimates in 1980 dollars of the likely direct and indirect medical costs associated with selected events. The range is quite broad, reflecting the range in possible outcomes of different conditions. For example, estimates of costs associated with convulsion following DTP vaccination range from $259 to $869,574. These values do not include pain and suffering. There is marked variation between high and low estimates, depending on severity of the condition and the sequelae; at present we cannot project the likely distribution.Some of the events listed as compensable in the bill are relatively frequent, and even though there is little evidence of permanent damage associated with them, any projectable frequency of severity and outcome would result in inordinate expendirures, given the level of compensation pryposed. As an example, Table 3 shows that the estimated annual frequency of convulsion, collapse, and high-pitched unusual cry might exceed 35,000 individual events. These events have not teen established to be associated with permanent damage.However, if 10 percent of them resulted in hospitalization with medical expenses of $2,500, thus qualifying for compensation, actual medical reimbursable expenses would total $8,:50,000. If all of these individuals were also awarded $10,000 for \"pain and suffering,\" this category would total $35,000,000.Along with the additional 20 percent for lawyers fees, this could come to an annual total of over $52 million, even though no pprmanenr damage had occurred and actual expenses were $8.7 million. 21 17 This figure is clearly far in excess of the true cost of these eventsand would require imposition of a surtax on DTP vaccine of approxi-metely $52 million (nearly $3/dose). This would sore than double thecurrent price of the vaccine in order to pay for events not havingpermanent consequences and not considered clearly related to vaccineadministration. By contrast, payment for encephalopathiea occurring within 7 days ofreceipt ofpertussia-containing vaccine and accompanied by residualdeficit 1year later (a condition which might truly represent lastingdamage potentially resulting from vaccine) would cost approximatelythe same total amount. For example, if there are 50 of theseinstances per year and all have direct and indirect costs at the upperrange of the estimate, this would total approximately $40 million.Adding to that the maximum $100,000 each for pain and suffering andheadding 20 pi-rcelit lawyor'a fees would yield a total cost ofapproximately $54 million. These are just two examples. TheCongressional Budget Office has estimated that the cost of this billto the Federal Treasury (not including the increxe in the cost ofFederally-funded vac, le doses) for the first three years would be$4.9 billion, with an expectation that the annual cost of $225 millionfor each succeeding year will be covered by the surcharge revenues. 3.Retroactiviti. Thr b.11 provides that any designated event whichoccurred before enactment would also automatically be eligible forcompensation.Given the lack of specificity of eligibility criteria,one can envision situations in which parents with disabled or retardedchildren. many now grown, might make claims boxed on their 22 18 recollection that within the appropriate time period following receipt of vaccine their child had manifested \"prolonged sleeping with difficulty arousing\" or \"high-pitched unusual screaming\" which was neither noted nor recorded at the time.The difficulty in proving or disproving such allegations would almost certainly result in a large number of individuals receiving compensation whether or not it was merited, further driving up the costs of vaccination. There are numerous additional problems with the program that.this bill would establish, and I will mention some of them.The proposed program does not represent an exclusive remedy; individuals may choose whether to pursue the tort system or the compensation system.This provision is inconsistent with one of the major stated purposes of the bill, which is to relieve the pressure of litigation on vaccine manufacturers. Also troublesome are the open-ended borrowing from the Treasury, and the procedural provisions, under which injured parties would make their claims in an ex parte proceeding, leaving it unclear as to whether the Secretary and the Fund have a role in the decision to compensate. These factors interrelate to make the coats of the bill prunibitive and far in excess of actual expenses. Hr. Chairman, this is a very complicated area and one in which it is obvious that there is not a single simple solution. However, we are not convinced that a Federal program is needed to accomplish this and are certain that S. 2117 will not do so. As well-intentioned as it is, the provisions of S. 2117 complicate /IN already complex situation, rather than help to resolve it.For the reasons I have outlined and for several others, we oppose thewe will continue to work with this committee on the imoortant policy issues addressed by this legislation.I would be happy to discuss any questions you might have. 23 19 TABU. 1 AVERAGE1VACCINE PRICES/DOSEMARCH 1984 VACCINE PUBLIC SECTOR share for all manufacturers of DTP/DT/Td and mic-pointprice for a given manufacturer if their was a range in public sector prices. 2 20 TABLE 2 ESTIMATED CURRENT ANNUAL SIZE OF U.S. VACCINE MARKET' and 1983 distribution.2Tota1 from 1982 Biologics Surveillance data, public sector usage fromImmunization Project reports; private sector usage is the remainder.3The public/private mix of these formulations is based on BiologicsSurveillance data for distribution of each formulation, and publicsector use of DTP/DT/Td as a proportion of total use.4Assumes all measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines are sold as MMR, whichis true for 85Z of the total for etch antigen. 2 5 21 TABLE 3 ESTIMATED NUMbERS OF SPECIFIED EVENTS PER YEAR\u00b0TEMPORALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF VACCINES, U.S.BASED ON ANNUAL VACCINE USE ANDBEST ESTIMATE OF RATES OF OCCURRENCE EVEN:AnaphylaxisConvu1slonEncephalopilthyor encephalitisESTIMATEDVACCINE TIME OPV variable 87 \u00b0Based on annual birth cohort of 3.5 million childrenExcept for OPV the estimated number of doaes which should be administeredi.ccording to current recommendations, assuming 90% coverage and an equal riskwith each dose of a series.

Dr. BRANDT. I think the keyword is \"fully.\" We have investigat-ed the causes and the potential implications. I am not personally satisfied that we have fullyinvestigated or thatwe have a full un- derstanding. It seems clear that there are a number ofreasons for this that vary somewhatfrom manufacturer to manufacturer as well.Senator HAWKINS. Is ityour understanding that we are down tothree manufacturers for DPT and only one for measles,mumps, and rubella?Dr. HINMAN. That iscorrect, Madam Chairman. There is alsoonly a single manufacturerof oral polio vaccine in the UnitedStates at the present time.Some of the factors involvedinclude market forces. The market is a predictableone since a finite number of children are born and a finite number of doses of vaccine will be required, but we do not, as Dr. Brandt has said, understand all of the reasons that are in- volved in the decrease in number of manufacturers. Senator HAWKINS. Areyou investigating that?Dr. HINMAN. We have hadconversations with the manufactur-ers. However, as I understand it, some of this is viewed as being, privileged business information.Senator HAWKINS. Is the Government prepared to take over the responsibility of producing the vaccines if the manufacturers do decide to stop producing vaccine?I)r. BRANDT. Weare not prepared to begin to produce the vac- cines. We certainly will beprepared to deal with the manufactur-ers to try to work out some way to keep vaccines being produced if, in fact, all of the manufacturers were to find it necessary to cease product ion.We have no evidence frommy conversations with all of the vac-cine manufacturers that there is any threat of thaton the horizon, by any stretch of the imagination. But this program is so important to +!.e health of children that we would certainly work with vac- cine manufacturers to tryto solve the problem.Senator HAWKINS. Have theprices of the individual immuniza- tions gone up as the number of manufacturers has gone down? Dr. BRANDT. The price hasgone up, and, indeed, the number ofmanufacturers has gone down. I think, Madam Chairman, in my testimony. table I shows thecurrent prices of the vaccines.SenatorHAWKINS.It is my understanding that it has gone from to $.1 a vaccine. Is that correct? For a shot? I)r. HINMAN. The price ofvaccines has risen, yes, Madam Chair-man. Itis 'possibly worth pointingout, however, that even when there was only a single manufacturer of one of the vaccines that comes to mind quici:lymeasles, mumps, and rubellathe price of that vaccine did decreaseover a period of several years in the earlyand mid-1970's, and it has been increasing lately.The current pricewe pay in the Federal contract for a dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine Correct.Senator HAWKINS. What about DPT?Dr. HINMAN. We do not presently have a Federal contract forDPT vaccine, but the average cost in the public sector under Statecontractif one takes the three manufacturers, the current pricesthey are charging, and average thoseit comes to $1.43 a dose.About a year ago it was about 68 cents.Senator HAWKINS. Sixty-eight cents a year ago, and it has goneup to what?Dr. HINMAN. $1.43.Senator HAWKINS. Has the administration considered requiring amanufacturer to develop or produce one vaccine as a condition toFederal Government purchase of another?Dr. BRANDT. We have not seriously considered that, MadamChairman, largely because we have not seen an immediate threat.by any manufacturer to withdraw from the vaccine market. I thinkour alternatives in case this were to occur would be, one, to deal with the manufacturers to see if we could work with them to re-solve this problem in some other way than to force them into thiskind of situation.Senator HAWKINS. It does not bother you that we just have onemanufacturer for MMR vaccine?I)r.BRANDT. Well,it bothers me in one way, in the sensethat-Senator HAWKINS. Would that be called a monopoly?Dr. BRANDT. Yes, that is what I would call it, I guess, but I think,on the other hand, that production of these vaccines does require a great deal of scientific and manufacturing ability. As long as thevaccines are available, I am not concerned aboutoverly concernedaboutthe fact that-Senator HAWKINS. Do you know how much stock the one manu-facturer has?I)r. BRANDT. I am sorry?Senator HAWKINS. How much stockdo they have an inventory?Dr. BRANDT. I do not know for sure, but I think they usuallymaintain a 2-year supply.Dr. HINMAN. Yes.Senator HAwkiNs. Two years?Dr. BRANDT. Yes, Ma'am.Senator HAWKINS. In the past the Federal Government has influ-enced the willingness of the private pharmaceutical companies topursue the development of vaccines. Eli Lilly was given a contract for flu vaccine, and, more recently, the Michigan Department of health and Biologics was given a contract to develop a safer per-tussis vaccine. Have you found these direct contracts successful?Dr. HINMAN. The current contract for development of improvedpertussis vaccine was not bid on by any of the current commercialman u fact urers.Senator HAWKINS. Why do you think that was?I)r. HINMAN. I cannot respond to that. You might wish to ask themanufacturers.Senator HAWKINS I will. I just wondered if you had an opinion.Dr. HINMAN. I think that Government-funded research in vac-cine development hit.i historically been of great utility.29 25Senator HAWKINS. The correlation between the Federal Govern- ment purchase of vaccines for the State vaccination programs and the reduction of diseaseseem pretty well established. Using mea- sles as an example, in 1965when Congress added measles to the community health service extension program, 6.1 million doses were distributed. But in 1969 and 1970, when no funds wereappro- priated for thisprogram, only 4.9 and 4.5 million doses were dis- tributed, and the reported incidences of measles increased from 25,826 cases in 1969 to 47,351 in 1970 and 75,290 in 1971. So the incidences of measles didnot decrease until theprogram was re- funded in 1971. So ifwe are concerned as a country about the out- breaks of pertussis, why don't you include it in your Federal immu- nization program?Dr. HINMAN. We do includepertussis immunizationas a part of the Federal immunizationprogram. We have not to date estab-lished a consolidated Federalcontract for the purchase of DPT vac- cine. I think there have been two major reasons for that.Until very recently, the price of DPT vaccine has been low enough that we did not feelwe would save enough money by estab-lishing a consolidated Federal contract to make it worth it.The second item is thatyou have been talking about the problemof decreasing numbers ofvaccine manufacturers. Thereare three manufacturers of DPT. Award of a single Government contract po- tentially would bea disincentive to the unsuccessful bidders.Now we presently havea request for proposals for the purchaseof diphtheria, tetanus, andpertussis vaccines undera consolidated Federal contract, both for the vaccine stockpile whichwe are pres- ently establishing and for continuing use in the grant program. Dr. BRANDT. I think, Madam Chairman, you have madean ex- tremely important point early on, and that is the success of the im- munization program. If I could talc( just a minute, I would like to cite just a few examples.From 1980 through 1983, the number of reported vaccine-pre- ventable diseases in thiscountry in children fell by 71 percent inthat 3-year period, from roughly 28,000 to roughly 8,000cases. That is a dramatic improvement,due in large part to the vaccines.Second, goalswere set by Surgeon General Richmond in 1979 forimmunization of this country to be achieved by the year 1990. At the end of 1983we had achieved virtually all of those. So I thinkthe immunizationprogram has been remarkably successful in re- ducing the suffering and problems of young children. It is, therefore, itseems to me, absolutely essential that this pro- gram be continued; that we continue our research on vaccines, both to develop new onesas well as to improve the ones that we have, and we certainly have thatunder way as a major activity.Senator HAWKINS. Isn't ittrue, though, that DP'I' is the only combination of vaccines which isn't purchased by the Federal Gov- ernment through consolidated contract?Dr. HINMAN. If youare talking about childhood vaccines, that iscorrect. We do not purchase influenza vaocine or pneumococcal vaccine, eithi.r. whichare other vaccines recommended for relative-ly widespread use.Ibelieve that. given the reflection of interest in Stategovern- ments in getting a consolidated Federal contract for DPT vaccine, 26that it is quite likely we will have such a contract within the nextseveral months.Senator HAWKINS. Within months?Dr. HINMAN. Within the next several months.Senator HAWKINS. I understand the FDA convened a group of ex-perts in November 1983 to review the recent efforts and progress inimproving the vaccine safety and to review studies of serious reac-tions to the DPT vaccine in children. Can you summarize the re-sults of that meeting?Dr. BRANDT. I think, Madam Chairman, that actually it was notthe FDA that convened that, but the World Health Organization.The meeting was in Geneva, and we had people from the Food andDrug Administration in attendance.We will be happy to provide you with a summary of that andother material from that meeting. We will be happy to provide it toyou for the record.[NOTE: In the interest of economy, the material referred to wasretained in the file of th': committee.]Dr. BIZANDT. Dr. Hinman wants to add something.Dr. HINMAN. There was one other meeting which may be the oneto which you are referringin which the FDA and the NIH collabo-rated in bringing together a gr )up pf people to look at the issue offollowup of studies for peophi who have been involved, childrenwho have been involved, in studies of DPT reactions, specificallythe study at the University of California, Los Angeles. I believethat may be the meeting to which you are referring. The result of that was that a letter was sent to the principal in-vestigator in Los Angeles in which the originally proposed studywas not approved, butthe statement was made that the FDA, theGovernment, would be interested in providing support for followupof the 18 children who were of particular interest. We have not re-ceived a response to that letter to my knowledge.Senator HAWKINS. You have not received a response?Dr. HINMAN. Not to my knowledge.Senator HAwKiNs. Would you check that out and get back withus?Dr. HINMAN. Yes, Ma'am.Senator HAWKINS. Thank you, Dr. Hinman.[Material supplied follows:][NOTE.

The difficulty of eval-uating AR on an international level was noted because of luconsisten-cies-in international standards and definitions; different medicalpractices (e.g., the French frequestly prescribq anticonvulsants prophy-lactically with pertussis vaccines); and differences in productsattributable to different manufacturing methods. However, the National,Childhood Encephalopathy Study in the United Kingdom was considered in -some detail in addition to U.S. data.. Serious adverse reactions to DTPas described in recent U.S. studies were reviewed (see Table 1, firstattachment).Tb FDA and CDC adverse reaction reporting systems were discussed. FDAhielogie adverse reaction reports for pertussis containing vaccines arevoluntarily provided on a monthly or quarterly basis by the major manu-facturers although some manufacturers will report adverse reactionsearlier, if, in their judgment, circumstances require this; they haveno standard format; they do not generally provide sufficient denominatorinformation.The reports are usually based on information voluntarilyprovided to the manufacturers by physicians. The CDC system does use astandard format, but all of the information which would be useful is notalways presided. The CDC system depends primarily on reports origi-nating with parents, thrcugll a health service physician, and occa-sionally, originating with a private physician. This system coverstolut 40 srcent of vaccinations that include pertussis antigens.Kffrts to strenethen both adverse reaction reporting eystems are under-a, het both systes currently provide useful information to healthcare scientists.

In addition tothe problem posed by the small number of subjects, data for some of theparameters such as neurologic and psychometric evaluations would be extremelydifficult to interpret in the strict scientific sense because of the problemcem:aon to studies of this type, the lack of comparable baseline data for studysubjects.Again, given the small number of participants in the study, therei very low probability of detecting any HLA associations. Experience withother diseases has shown that a strong familial history of a condition isusually observed if HLA typing is to demonstrate any association withdisease.Current information does not suggest a strong familial associationwith pertussis reactions. Interpretation of IfLA results would be furtherconfounded by the observation that there are two distinct subsets of adverseevents, convulsive reactions and collapse reactions (hypotonic/hyporesponsive). Because of the small number of subjects in the proposal, it was suggested thatif you still wanted to pursue HLA studies on the 18 children, you nay want toindf.pendently consider this matter with Dr. 1erasaki at UCLA to inquirewhether or not he would be willing to do the assays for you. 39 35 J.til df f , M. of' and Dr. Paul D.

HINMANThe contract with the Michigan Department of Public Health was awarded for three years with the intent of developing A new candidate acellular vaccine for per- tussis. The project consists of two phases: (t) development and testing of an acellular pertuasis vaccine; and (2) the preparation of an aluminum adsorbed DTP vaccine using the acellular pertuasis vaccine as the \"P\" component. Work officially began on the project on September 1, 1983. For the past ten months the contractor hasbeen examining various factors which might enhance cell growth and biosynthesis of twemical components of the cell walls of the pertusaW baste sum involved inthe pion of a protective immune response (i.e. production of protective anti-bodies).e efforts have now reached a point where the cell fractions have beenisolated from the culture fluid, partially purified on columns, and are now being ex- amined and characterised for purity and biological activity.The isolation and purification of the protective cell wall component is a very labor intensive and difficult task to perform requiring a great deal of skill and a certain amount of good fortune. Because this approach to pertuasis vaccine development isnew, there are a number of technical problems associated with it, which still need tobe resolved. Therefore, it would be very difficult, at this time, to predict exactly when the vaccine will be available for clinical testing. However, barring unforeseen technical difficulties and based on the current status and progress of the contractor, it is possible that clinical studies could begin as soon as the Fall of 1986.Senator HAWKINS. Once theyare available for testing, then how long does it take after that to have them available to the public? Dr. HINMAN. After that, it takes quite a while, also. In could just explain, for example, the NIH has vaccine evaluation centers at Marshall University in West Virginia and Vanderbilt Universityin Nashville which are presently ready to administer improved per- tussis vaccines to children under controlled clinical conditions. Itseems likely that improved vaccines from commercial manufactur-ers may be submitted first for testing before the contract at Michi-gan reaches fruition.But even after this limited clinical testing to establish initialseroconversion response and safety, there will be larger scale fieldtrials required to demonstrate efficacy. One problem with this isthat the incidence of pertussis is, fortunately, low enough in thiscountry that in order to have a large-scale trial to demonstrate effi-cacy, we would have to have a very large-scale trial. It is likelythat field trials to demonstrate efficacy will have to be undertakenin another country.Senator HAWKINS. Undertaken in another country?Dr. HINMAN. That is correct.Senator HAWKINS. And we will accept that data? 44 404Dr. HINMAN. Yes, Madam' if these are carried out under proto-cols approved in the United States.Senator HAWKINS. Well, then, why can't we accept the Japanesevaccine which is proven to be safe?Dr. HINMAN. We have not received data to indicate the efficacyfrom the Japanese.Senator HAWKINS. I went to Japan- after one of these hearingsand I talked to the Minister of Health and asked if we could testhis vaccine, and he said no one had ever requested to test the vac-cine; he would be more than happy to provide it. Now I understand that Wyeth Laboratories is testing it forsafety. Are those under yourprotocols, the testing they are doing?Dr. HINMAN. That is being done toward development of an inves-tigational new drug which would allow, then, clinical testing in thecenters funded by the NIH.Senator HAWKINS. Which would be shorter, for us to wait for the Michigan Department of Health vaccine, which you say may beyears and years, or for us to test the Japanese vaccine, which mayrequire testing outside of the country?Dr..So will the Wyeth product most probably.Dr. Bz.trwr. The difficulty, Madam Chairman, is that there areso few cases of pertussis inthis country that it is very difficult toefficacy of a preventative if, in fact, the disease rarelyoccurs anyway, since mostchildren are already immunized. There-fore, it would require us, under either circumstance, to go outside.Our own view is that both efforts should proceed.Senator HAWKINS. You should be testing the Japanese vaccineout of the country?Dr. BRANDT. Yes.Senator HAWKINS. Why can't we accept the Japanese data?Dr. BRANDT. It assumes that they have it. I am sure that Wyeth--Senator HAWKINS. They're very clever.Dr. BRANDT. I am well ;Aware of that, yes, Madam. I know that.I am sure that so is Wyeth, as matter of fact. [Laughter.] I am sure that if Wyeth were satisfied or otherwise, that thatwould already have been accepted and utilized.As you know, up until now we have had fairly strict regulations concerning foreign data, but we are in factwe have reexaminedthat and use it a great deal ore.Him would like, I will trto get an up-to-date status report onthe Wyeth situation and sen it to you.Senator HAWKINS. Thank you. I would appreciate that for thisrecord.[Material supplied follows:]STATUS REPORT: PRIMING OF JAPANIVIR PERTUS818 VACC1NRWyeth Laboratories and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,NIH are participating in the studies of an experimental Diphtheria and TetanusToxoid and Pertussis (DPTI vaccine.The vaccine, prepared by Wyeth, incorporates a Japanese acellular pertussis com-ponent.

Dr. Mason, we don't mean to neglect you. The CDC has funded a study to evaluate the effectiveness of a three- dose rather than the current fourdoee of pertussis vaccine. If that proves to be effective, do you think it might reduce adverse.reac-tions?Dr. MASON. That is one of the reasons we are doing the study: first of all, to make sure that the efficacy of the vaccine will not be lowered in the process of reducing the number of vaccinations that are necessary; and, secondly, to find out whether there are fewer adverse reactions. The study is not completed, but I would think we would have it in another 2years.Senator HAWKINS. Two years? But if it were successful, it may reduce the adverse reactions by as much as 20 percent? Dr. MASON. We wouid hopeso, but we don't have the data yet. That is what we are trying to determine.Senator HAWKINS. I understand that the Public Health Service Immunization Practices Advisory Committee, which is a mouthful, has reviewed the data regarding the relationship between the his- tory of febrile and nonfebrile convulsions and the risk of adversereactions following vaccination. Has this review prompted any re- consideration of the contraindications for vaccine?Dr. BRANur. Yes, Madam; for the DTP vaccination, we published on April 6, 1984, in \"the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report\"a supplementary statement on the contraindications to the receiptof pertussis. We would be pleased to submit a copy of that for the record.Senator HAWKINS. Yes; I would like that, please.

Based on available evidence, the ACIP doesnot .consider a family history of convulsion to be a contraindication to receipt of pertussisvaccine However. a personal history of a prior convulsion should be evaluated before initiatingor continuing immunization with vaccines containing a pertussis component at, diphtheriaand tetanus toroids with pertussis vaccine MTN) (Table aDEFERRAL OF DTP FOR INFANTS AND CHILDREN WITH PERSONAL HISTORIESOF CONVULSION IS)Although there are uncertainties in the reported studies, recent data suggest that infantsand young children who have previously had convulsions (whether febrile or nonfebrile) aremore likely to have seizures following pertussis vaccination than those without such histories12) Available data do not indicate that seizures temporally associated with vaccine adminis-tration predispose to permanent brain damage or exacerbate existing conditions. The inci-dence of pertussis in most areas of the United States is presently quite low. Consequently, forinfants and young children who have histories of seizures before initiation ofDTP immuniza-tion or who develop seizures before the four-dose primary series is completed. initiating orcontinuing pertussis immunization should be deferred until it can be determined that there isnot an evolving neurologic disortset present. If such disorders are found, the infants or childrenshould be given diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (DT) instead of DTP. If DT is used, three dosesat least 4 weeks apart, followed by a fourth dose 8-12 months later, arts recommenced forinfants For children 1 year of age or older, two doses of DT at least 4 weeks apart, followedby a third dose 6.12 months later, are recommended.RECOMMENDATIOPIS FOR BEGINNING OR CONTINUING DTP AFTER DEFERRALFor infants and c'tildren whose DTP immunizations are deferred because of histories ofconvulsion(s). the decision whether to proceed with DTP immunization can usually be madewithin the newt few months For infants who have received fewer than three doses of DTP,such a decision in most instances should be made no later than at 1 year of age Following in-dividual assessment, it may be decided to proceed with DTP, because infants and young chil-dren with convulsive disorders also appear to be at higher risk of adverse outcomes if theycontract oertuSSIS disease Further, if unimmunized infants attend day-care centers, specialclinics. and residential-care Settings where other children may be un.mmunized or if theyU.S DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES / PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE 47C- 4 170twit April 6.

The occurrence of single seizures (temporally unr4sociated with DTP) in infantsand youngchildren,whilenecessitatingevaluation,teed not contraindicate DTPimmunization, particularly if the seizures can be satiefactorfly explained. An example might bea febrile seizure in the course of exenthern subitum in a 14-month-old child. As with all infantsor children with one or more febrile Seizures, consideration of continuous anticonvulsantprophylaxis may be warranted.Parents should be fully informed of the benefits and risks of immunization with DTP. Par-ents of infants and children with histories of convulsions should particularly be made aware ofthe slightly increased chance of post-Immunization seizures. A minimum of three doses ofDTP given at intervals of at least 4 weeks is necessary to provide adequate protection againstpertussis. A fourth dose 8-12 months law is also recommended.CONTRAINDICATIONS TO PERTUSSIS VACCINEHyperserthaivity to vaccine components, presence of an evolving neurologic disorder, or ahistory of a severe reaction (usually within 48 hours) following a previous dose all remaindefinitive contraindications to the receipt of pertussis vaccine. Severe reactions include col-lapse or shock, persistent screaming episode, temperature 40.5 C (105 F) or greater,convulsion(s) with or without accompanying fever, seven alterations of consciousness,generalized end/or keel neurologic signs, or systemic allergic reactions. Although hemolyticanemia and thrombocytopenic purpura have previously been considered contraindications bythe ACIP, the evidence of a causal link between these conditions and pertussis vaccination isnot sufficient to retain them as contraindications.OTHER IMeAUNIZATIONS FOR INFANTS AND CHILDREN FOR WHOM PERTUSSISVACCINE IS CONTRAINDICATEDImmunization with DT and/or oral polio vaccine is not known to be associated with an in-creased risk of convulsions. Therefore, a history of prior convulsions is not a contraindicationto receipt of these toxoids end vaccine. In addition, a history of prior convulsion(s) is not acontraindication for measles-mumps-rubella PAMR) vaccine.

I have several questions that I will just submit to you at this time for the record. You may have to ,consult the Justice Departmenton some of them when you give us ananswer, because I am concerned with your final statement that you are not convinced that the Federal program is needed to resolve the situation and thatyou oppose this bill.Does that mean you are completely satisfied with what we have? Dr. BRANDT. Well,no; we're not completely satisfied with whatwe have, Madam Chairman. I think the real issue is how to go about structuring a system that is fair and that at the same time is clearly based upon good, solid, clinical; and scientific evidence of adverse effects thatare clearly associated with vaccines. I thinkthat at this point in timewe are trying to determine what is themost effective systein.The reason that statement is in there is that we have examples of no-fault-type systems thatare maintained in the private sector by insurance companies and others, and the question really in part is whether or not that system works, and do we need Federal legis- lation to accomplish itor can it be done within current authorities?Those are legal questions. Asyou point out, the Department of Jus- tice will have to speak to that.I think the concept of the bill is certainly one that I like and think is important. I think that you should be commended for rais- ing this situation because it is very, very clear that all of us are aware that every vaccine is not 100 percent safe, in the sense that there are children who still experience problems with them. It does seem reasonable that some sort of system to assist in the care of those children be setup. I guess the real question is, what is themost effective way to accomplish that?Senator HAWKINS. Is it stilltrue thaf0 to 50 percent of the vac- cines are purchased through the Federal Government? Dr. HINMAN. That is correct.Senator HAWKINS. Shouldn't the Federal Government have some responsibility in the distribution of this vaccine? Dr. BRANDT. I thinkwe do have some responsibility certainly forinforming people and for providing information, in doing the sorts of things that weare trying to do at the present time.Whether a system suchas this needs to be a Federal system orwhether it can bea private system, working through the estab-lished insurance industry and manufacturers, I guess, is more of a legal question than Iam competent to deal with.Senator HAWKINS. Butyou do support the concept?Dr. BRANDT. I personally think the concept is important, yes. Senator HAWKINS. I appreciate that you have been willing to work with us to try to develop a solution to the problems that wereraised in these four hearings. We have workedepery closely with the American Academy of Pediatrics, who really feel they have as- sumed already too much private responsibility for a mandated pro- gram. I am sure that if we all work together that we can help the children, who are the ones who are really injured by this. We appreciate your coming here today. I know you are busy, gen- tlemen. I work with youon so many other projects, and I appreci-ate your cooperativeness in working with us to solve this problem. Dr. BRANDT. Thankyou very much. 38-4')4 0 - H4 - 450 46Senator HAWKINS.

SCHWARTZ, REPRESENTINGDISSATISFIED PARENTS TOGETHERMr. SCHWARTZ. Thank you, Senator Hawkins. I appreciate theopportunity to appear before you today and to represent Dissatis-fied Parents Together [DPT]. We are a group who sees as its ri-mary responsibility the education of parents and, working with doctors, the education of physicians and public health authoritiesas to the need to be concerned about the pertussis vaccine's safetyas well as about pertussisdisease.In the testimony which follows we would like to cover four mainpoints. First, we want to review the reasons why we believe that abill like S. 2117 is needed, contrary to the HHS testimony. Second,we want to recall the 10 principles which we presented before you at the last hearing that we thought ought to be used as a guide forjudging what is a genuine and acceptable vaccine victim compensa-tion bill. Third, we would like to. assess how S. 2117 measures up tothese 10 principles. Fourth, we would like to identify some keyissues and concerns regarding the bill, briefly closing with a fewfinal remarks. ,In terms of the need for a bill like S. 1227, at the outset we par-ticularly. want to thank Senator Hawkins and Chairman Hatch andthe other cosponsors of S. 2117 for their leadership in bringing theissue of vaccine safety to national attention.This committee's hearing on May 7, 1982 and July 22, 1983helped demonstrate the need for national legislation such as S.2.117. The record developed in those hearings is an important partof the background of this bill, and any attempt to evaluate the billhas to begin with a review of the findings which emerged fromthose hearings and the materials contained in them.The hearings provided a basis for several findings:Finding No. 1is that pertussis vaccinethe \"P\" part vaccineis a relatively crude, impure, rea-Aive vac-cine of unquestioned toxicity and uncertain character. .Now it is disturbing to hear HHS say that the pertussis vaccineis safe, although notperfectly safe. It is disturbing because one ofIIIIS's own doctors who is involved in this was quoted recently inTile Washington Post saying, \"We want to eliminate 95 percent of the garbage that has nothing o do with protection but does con-tribute to adverse reactions.' Garbage in the vaccinethat is anoutspoken way of saying it, but I think when you look at the HI-IStestimony, as i hope we will have a chance to do more closely, you 51.

Mass under contrailwith four NIH doisions. the Defense Department.the Energy Department and the National ScienceVousdation.Welfg. Victor Cohn21171.4AuMr. SCHWARTZ. I think it is important to emphasize that state- ments about the pertussis vaccine being crude and of unquestioned toxicity, come from leadingproponents of the vaccine, such as Dr. Mortimer.Finding No. 2, since Madsen's 1933 study, more than 50 years ago, it has been know that whole .cell pertussis vaccines can cause highfevers;convulsion;anaphylacticshock;epilepsy;brain damage; mental retardation; paralysis; loss of hearing, sight and speech; and even death. Weare not saying that all those things arecaused only by pertussis vaccine, but those things can be caused by pertussis vaccine. That is demonstrated in 50 years of published medical literature.Finding No. 3, the vast majority of practicing physicians and public health clinics in the United States have until very recently either been uninformed of these facts or unwilling to admit them. Generally agreedupon contraindications to administration of the vaccine have been ignored all too frequently, with tragic resulting consequences. The contraindications which have been set out by the quasi-official bodies like AMP and the AAP have been far too 521st,t; 48narrow. This is particularlytroublesome as the vaccine system hasbecome more and more compulsory.Physicians have failed to keep adequate records and make ade-quate reports of severe vaccine reactions. Perhaps most damning of all, physicians have failed to inform their patients and listen tothem about vaccine dangers and reactions. Physicians have thusdeprived us parents of the information we need to protect our chil-dren and deprived themselves of critical knowledge about what is really going on with their patients, so that they can treat themwell. I don't mean to indict all physicians, but it is a sad fact thatwhat is known at the highest levels of the American Academy ofPediatrics and the American Medical Association and HHS has not made its way to the rank and file. Adequate safeguards are notbeing implemented in current practice.Finding No. 4, physicians have tended to rely on the belief thatthe Government would not license, and pharmaceutical manufac- turers would not sell, an unsafe vaccine to children. The doctorshave tended to assume that whole cell pertussis vaccine had been Hproventhoroughly safe and effective, and they have been told byHS that the vaccine is safe and effective. In testimony before youHHS has said the vaccine has been proven safe and effective, andyet we continue to have these severe reactions. Doctors have assumed that the vaccines have been adequatelytested and screened; that they have been manufactured with care-ful quality control; properly labeled, stored, and shipped according to specification; that they included adequate warnings, and weresubject to adequate postmarket surveillance.Even more important, universal legal requirements for pertussisvaccination have led most U.S. physicians to conclude that they nolonger need to exercise individual judgment in deciding on a case-by-case basis whethei, when, and under what circumstances to vac-cinate children with DPT vaccine. These legal requirements haveled to relaxation of physician vigilance, scrapping of the doctrine ofinformed consent, and incursion on a parent's first and most funda- mental freedomthe freedom to protect the health and well-beingof our children.Finding No. 5, the Health and Human Services Department hasperformed woefully and inadequately to protect the health of ourchildren in this area. It has failed for over 40 years to push for avaccine safer than the whole cell pertussis vaccine. It has not pro-vided an adequate regulatory framework to assure that whole cellvaccines are made and administered as safely as possible. HHS seesits function as licensing, not regulating vaccine; the Departmenthas not assumed responsibility for development of safer vaccines. For years HHS has studied the need for compensating childrenwho are severely injured by vaccines, yet the Department has notput forth a single proposal. They have been working on the com- pensation issue for more than 7 years, and yet HHS comes here today to say they are in favor of the concept, but they are justagainst its implementation. They say they don't think Federal leg-islation is needed, and they do not have any proposals of their ownto present after 7 years. How long do we have to wait for them tocome up with a program that meets the need and the responsibilitythat they have implicitly acknowledged here?53 49The Health and Human Services Department has stronglyen- couraged State laws mandating vaccination as a precondition for school entry, yet has failed to acknowledge the need for flexibility and sensitivity in the vaccination system. The Department has kept vaccine public policymaking in the hands of the few and out of sight of the many. It has not insisted on adequate accountability by doctors and vaccine makers and HHS has not been willing to be accountable itself. Perhaps worst of all, the Department has by and large refused to get the facts, know the facts, and share the facts with the public,or even acknowledge the facts that they have got.Finding No. 6, in the faceorthese realizations over the last 2years, parents have had to turn to the courts, to the Congress, and ultimately to ourselves, to redress these grievances. That is why Dissatisfied Parents Together came into being. That is why we de-veloped our own parent information packet: because the doctors have not done it forus, because Health and Human Services De-partment has not done it forus, because the manufacturers havenot made it available to parents. That is why increasing numbers of lawsuits are being filedon behalf of vaccine-damaged children,because there is no alternative for those children. That is why a bill like S. 2117 is needed.Finding No. 7, there isa middle ground for better protecting ourchildren's health. We need not be blind to the dangers of pertussis vaccine in order to be concerned about the dangers of whooping cough; but we need not ignore concerns about whooping cough in order to avoid vaccine-related brain damage. Parents are not going to freak out if we talk about these problems carefully and thought- fully. Parentsare not going to go nuts about this. We are con- cerned about the health ofour children, and we want to find a waythat is a middle ground. Being concerned about both the disease and the vaccine,we can work in an informed and balanced way to safeguard our children's health from both the riskof the disease and of the currentlravailable vaccine.The next section ofmy testimony talks about the 10 principlesthat we listed in previous testimony for what we thought would be a good bill. These principles were set forth before the bill was de- veloped, and I won t restate those. They are listed in my testimony from last time, andwe will put them in this record.Suffice it to say, the important .part about the principles was that DPT felt from thevery beginning we could not support a billthat simply compensated children who are injured; that did not provide a strong mandate for the creation of safer vaccines, for the use of safer vaccines, for the implementation of a safer system for using the current vaccine. We would not agree to sweep the prob- lem under the rug by paying off the families and the children who are damaged and let this process of administering a hazardous vac- cine go on without challenge.This is one of thereasons why we arP o pleased with S. 2117. S.i 2117 is not merelya compensation bill. It is a health bill and thebill sets forth specific requirements to assure that HHS assumes its proper responsibility; that doctors assume their proper responsibil- ity; that manufacturersassume their responsibility; and that weparents have the information available to assume our responsibil- ity. WeS 2117 'meets all 10 of the principles that we. havepreviously proscribed and, thus, Dissatisfied Parents Together doessupport enactment of S 2117. We do not say this without some res-ervations or concerns, however, and we want to discuss these con-cerns briefly at theend. Before doing so, however, we do want tohighlight several key points about the strengths of the bill.As I pointed out, we are very pleased about parts C and D of thebill because these provisions do create statutory mandates for de-velopment and use of safer vaccines and for strengthening the cur-rent system to preventserious vaccine reactions. These are notmere grants ofauthority. HHS has had much of the authority itneeds to properly protect the public but the Department has notused its authority adequately. Thus, the bill, S. 2117, creates a non-discretionary duty, in fact, a set of duties, that the Secretary willhave to carry out to assure that the parents get the information,that vaccine serious reactions are recorded and reported, that asafer vaccine is developed and used, and to incorporate safeguardsin the currentvaccine system to assure that children are protected.it the Secretary of HHS fails to use any authority she has underany existing law orfails to implement this law to carry out theset\u00bbandates. a citizen suit could .be filed and the courts would manda-mus the Secretary to act.The record is clear as to why this isnal.ded, the record is painfully clear.Likewise. these parts of the bill mandate certain safeguards to becarried out by the doctors and the health care providers. The newduties would become part of a physician's 'standards of practice orcare. Any failure to carry out these mandates, to make the re-quired information available to parents, to keep the records, tomake the reports, to abide by contraindications, would at leastcreate a presumption ofnegligence, perhaps even constitute negli-gence per se. A patternof refusal or failure to implement the lawcould lead to punitive damages under tort law or be considered inla-ensure rview proceedings. We are pleased to note thatand Ithink thilt is something that Senator Hawkins is entitled to takesome credit for, and Ithinkitis a wave of the futurewe arepleased to note that the State legislature of' Maryland has becomethe first State to pass legislation based on part C and part D ofthishillI third; there are many more States to follow. Again, nationalleadership is neededIn the Maryland State Legislature, interestingly, we said victimcompensation is a key element, and the State legislators said to us,We syrn pat h ize with h you. but that's a national problem. You havetatu t he Congress. That iswhat our State legislators told us inMar.land. and that is what we are finding throughout the country.,-canperis:ition is not going to he done by the private in--orance s-.trni. ithasn't beenItis not going to be doneby theState-Itis not going tohe done by MIS.

The vaccine licensure processpolicy processes have not been open to the public.Lirnt input has not onk not been solicited by the AAP or ACIP; h.-\\1/4 hen ottered. parentinput has frequently beentotal-.0 51ly ignored. The presently closed system needs to be open and ac- countable, and these provisions for procedural openness and judi- cial review will help yr'duce healthier children and a better system.Without parts C and D of the bill, DPT could not support it. We think these provisionsare critical, and we think they deserve spe-cial appreciation and attention. It is too bad that the Health De4 partment did not see fit to address those parts of the bill. I think, if they had; they would have said, as they have told.us previously in correspondence, that they could not support these other provisions, either.Compensation without prevention would sweep the problem under the rug. We think there is a serious problem and it needs to be dealt with. If there isone question in this hearing that wewould like the committee to consider, it is, Is there a problem and does it need to be dealt with?If I heard HHS right, they said either there isn't a problem, or there is but it doesn t needto be dealt with, or it does need to bedealt with but not byus, or give us 7 more years to think about it.I don't know what I heard, frankly. It is very confusing to me be- cause we have yet to hear what legislation, if any, HHS would sup- port. We know what theyare against, but we don't know what theyare for.We also want to applaud the bill's sponsors for ensuring that vaccine, compensation decisionmaking in individual cases is left to the Federal court. HHS hasan institutional conflict of interest byvirtue of its healthcare cost containment and vaccination promo-tion responsibilities that would preclude it from deciding fairly whether a claimant qualifies for compensation and, if so, how much.Their own interpretation of the medical and scientific literature on vaccine reactions demonstrates the Department's bias and its inclination to minimizeor even deny tie existence of the problem.We also commend S. 2117 because it guarantees a child's and parent's option tosue under traditional common law principles. Itwould be the final injustice to require vaccination by law, knowing that some children will be permanently brain-damaged or even die as a result, then to single out these children and their parents to take away their right tocommon law protection from negligence orunreasonably dangerous products, as the only group of children who don't have the right togo to court. That is hardly real justice.Nor would this be good social policy. The tort law system, even with the limits we pointedout in our testimony in July 1983, andthey are substantial, doesserve to deter negligence and help aug-ment regulatory incentives for safety. We ought not to simply abol- ish those incentives. UPT could not supportin fact, would have toopposeenactment of the billif it did not guaranteea child's option to sue under the traditional common law tort and contract principles.Wt. do want to mention two key issues of concern because they come up within our own group. It is important to understand that,while Dissatisfied Parents Together 1DPTI supports the bill, we do not claim to represent all the parents in the world or even all the parents who have vaccine-damaged kids. Moreover, there are par-56 52ents even in our group who have reservations about S. 2117. Theirconcerns focus around twomain points.Briefly, they fear that the compensation provisions could be usedby those who are pushing a very coercive mandatory vaccinesystem as a basis for saying, \"Look, we're going to compensate youif your child gets injured, so you don't have any gripe. Go aheadand get your kid vaccinated. If you don't, then we'll use these coer-cive methods.\".These are not just hypothetical fears; they are based on presentreal world events. Parents who are refusing to have their childrenvaccinated are beini- charged with child abuse or child neglect.Criminal prosecutions are being brought for truancy because thechildren are being excluded from school. Parents fear that theirchildren may be endangered by these shots, and with some verygood, very specific reasons in many cases. Instead of being com-mended for protecting their children, these parents are being pros-ecuted.It is interesting to know that this coercive atmosphere has beencreated by HHS. The Secretary of HHS has taken occasion to say itis child abuse for parents torefuse to have their child vaccinated.That wasn't said with qualification. It was not said that it is childabuse to do that when your child does not have a contraindication,is not a high-risk child or has not had a prior reaction. The Sec-retary merely said that it ischild abuse to refuse to have your chil-dren vaccinated regardless orthe vaccine, regardless of the specificcircumstances of the child, regardless of the risk. That is the coer-cive atmosphere that is being created.Therefore, our people are afraid that the message accompanyingenactment of S. 2117 may be, \"We'll compensate ;our child if he isinjured, so you can't object.\"We are not proposing specific solutions to this problem at thistime, but we would be willing to work with the committee ontrying to fashion a solution so that this concern can be avoided. Webelieve that the coercive tone and effect that is conveyed by state-ments such as those madeby the Secretary and resulting fromState criminal prosecutions must be eliminated.The second major parent concern which we think deserves men -tion is with the compensation part of the bill. The belief hasarisenamong some that somehowculpable physicians and drug companieswill be let off the hook if the bill were enacted, that somehow thetaxpayer will wind up paying the cost. I personally do not sharethe belief that culpable physicians and drug companies are going tohe let oft the hook, because the bill provides for, even guarantees,the parent's option to sue under common law princi' les. Thatmeans doctors arestill liable if they are guilty of negligence andpharmaceutical companies are still liable if they market an unrea-sonably dangerous product. The bill provides for subrogation andauthorizes the Justice Department to bring suit against a negligentdoctor or against the manufacturer of an unreasonably dangerousprc.du,.: if the compensation has been awarded. Nevertheless, weshare the cc,,,,ern that the bill should not act as a shield for wrong-doing by drug companies orphysicians or for the marketing of un-reasoa-nbly dangerous products. Again, we would be pleased torJ 53work with the committee to try to devise any further necessary safeguards in the bill.There are some other lesserconcerns with the bill that we think warrant some attention, and we have included them as an attach- ment to our testimony.I would like, with your indulgence, Senator Hawkins, to make a couple closing notes.The development and deepening of congressional concern about the continuing tragedy of vaccine-induced brain damage is most welcome. With your aid, we hope soon to reach the time whenmothers and fathers willnever again say, as you saw in the earlierfilm, \"They did this toour children, and then they left us alonewith the damage.\"But hope is one thing, and reality is another. Every day the status quo continues, we get more unutterably sad phone calls andletters from parents whose children have been maimed or killed. Many of them contain strong documentation. We are not saying that the health problems referred to in each and every letter can conclusively be proved to be vaccine related, but the claims ought to be looked into; they certainly suggest vaccine-induced injury,based on what we know from the available medical literature. A stop has to be put to this American tragedy as soon as it can be. The answer we propose is not to deny or ignore the dangers of whooping cough; we acknowledge those, but surely denial of these vaccine-injured children and denial of the dangers of the vaccine is not the answer, either.Yes, we are making slowprogress. Two years ago, Dr. Meyer ofthe FDA testified that withina year or a year and a half we wouldhave that safer vaccine. Well, it is 2 years, and a safer-vaccine is still some years away. Weare making some progress, but for someof us progress will not be fast enough.One year ago when I testified I noted that, even with our daugh- ter's seizure disorder, her motor problems, and her hyperactivity, with her speech impairment, and her learning difficulties, at least we were luckier than the parents of children who had died fromthe vaccine. Those who knew Julie, who met her, who worked with her, knew that we werevery blessed by having a very special child.But that was 1 year ago, and, as you know, 6 weeks ago Julie died. She died from a cardiac arrest suffered during status epilepti- cus resulting from her DPT-induced, uncontrolled seizure disorder.Now it is too late for Julie, and it is too late for so many other chil- dren; its 50 years too late, but it is not too late for tomorrow's chil-dren.So we ask you to consider this: at Julie's funeral we read a poem for her that is called \"I Carry Your Heart in My Heart.\" As the committee considers S. 2117, we ask you to do the samefor Julie,for all the injured and dead children like her, for the children who have be'n injured by the disease as well, but most of all for all oftomorrow's childrenplease,we ask the committee, \"Carry These Children in Your Hearts.\"Thank you, Senator Hawkins.[The prepared statement of Mr. Schwartz follows:]r .) 54 pc-pm-term BEFORE THE U.S. SENATECOMMITTEE ON RESOURCESON 211'(\"NATIONAL H. Schwartz,on behalf ofDissatisfied Parents Together (DPP) Members of the Committee, I thank you for the opportunity to appearbefore you today. I am here representing the views of Dissatisfied ParentsTogether (OPT).In the testimony which follows we plan to cover four main points.First, we want to review the reasons why we believe a bill like S. 2117 isneeded.Second, our testimony will recall the ten principles which we pre-viously stated for defining a genuine vaccine victim compensation bill.Third, we intend to assess how S. 2117 measures up to these ten principles.Fourth, we want to identify some key issues and concerns in the bill.Finally,we. want to present some brief closing remarks. I.The Need for a Sill Like S. 2117 At the outset, wr want to thank this Corrnittee, particularly SenatorHawkins, Chairmen Hatch, and the other co-sponsors of S. 2117, for theirleadership in bringing the issue of vaccine safety to national attention.ThiA Cannittee's hearings on may 1, 1 \u00b0R2, ane 2', 1983, have helpedderonetrate the need for national legislation such as S. 211/. The recorddeveloeed in those hearings is an important part of the background of thishill, and any attempt to evaluate the bill must begin with a review of the\"findings\" which emerge from those hearings. The hearings (and the underlying medical and scientific literature citedin those hearings) show that- FINDING 41:Pertussis vaccine (the \"P\" part of the a relatively crude, impure, vaccineof \"unquestioned toxicity\". and uncertain character. FINDING $2:Since Madsen's 1933 Study - - more than 50years aco - - it has been knew that whole cell pertussisvaccines can cause high fevers; convulsion; Anaphylacticshark; epilepsy; brain retardation; Paraly-sis; loss hearing, sight, and speech; and even death. FINDING 03!The vast majority of practicing physicians andpublic health clinics in the U.S. have until very recentlyeither been uninformed of these facts, unaware of them, orunwilling to Admit them. Agreed -upon contraindications toldministrntinn of the vaccine have been ignored all too'nxii:ently, with resulting tragic consequences. The\"- -'n'raindications\" which have been set nut by the quasi--fficial hneies like ACIP and the AAP have been far ton 5 9 55 narrow.This is particularly troubleecre as the vaccinesystem has beccee more and more ccmpulsory. Physicians have failed to keep adequate records and make adequate reports of severe vaccine reactions. Perhaps most damning of all,physicians have failed to inform their patients and listen to them about vaccine dangers and reactions. Physicians have thus deprived us parents of the information we need toprotect our children and deprived themselves of criticalknowledge about what is really going on with their patients.FINDING 04:Physicians have tended to rely on the belieftthat would not license, and pharmaceuticaltiemanufacturers 'mould not sell, an unsafe vaccine to children: The doctors have tended to assume that the vaccine had been proven thoroughly safe and effect adequately tested and screened; manufactured with careful quality control;properly labeled, stored and shipped according tospecification: included adequate warnings; and was subject to adequate post-market surveillance. Even more important,universal legal requirements for pertussis vaccination has led most U.S. physicians to conclude that they no longer need to exercise individual judgement in deciding on acase-by-case basis whether, when, and under whatcirmanstances to vaccinate children with DPT vaccine. These legal requirements have led to relaxation of physicianvigilance, screkoping of the dectrin3 of informed consent, and incursion on a, parent's first and most fundamentalfreedan - - the frefulan to protect the health and well -being of our children.FINDING 05:The Health and Human Services Departnent hasperformed woefully and inadequately to protect the health of our children in this area. It has failed for over 40 yearsto push for a vaccine safer than the whole cell pertussis vaccine.It has not provided an adequate regulatory frame- work to assure that whole cell vaccines are made and admin- istered as safely as possible. It has for years \"studied\"the need for ccmpensating children who are severely injured by vaccines, yet has not put forth a sle proposal.Tt has strongly encouraged state -lawn tvaccination asa pre-condition for school entry, yet has failed to acknowl- edge the need for flexibility and sensitivity in the system. The Department has kept vaccine policy making in the hands of the few and out of sight of the many. It has not insistedon adequate accountability by doctors and vaccine makers and 17 has not been willing to be accountable itself. Perhamworst of all, the Department has by and large refused to get the farts, know the facts, and share the facts with the public. FINDING 116:to the face of these realizations of the lasttwo yearn parents have had to turn to the courts, to the,'(-Incmc.S.9, and ultimately to ourselves to redress these Triowinces.That is why Disitisfied Parents Together (nPT1 56 came into being. That is why we developed our own parentinformagion packet on pertussis vaccine. That is whyincreatting nirdbere of lawsuits are being filed on belialkorvaceindedaloreised children. That is why a bill like S. 2117sneedeiifSFINDING 17:There is a \"Middle Ground\" for better 'OTectii---Tai our children's health. wP need not be blind tothe dangers of the vaccine in order to be concerned aboutthe dangers of the disease. We need not ignore concernsabout whooping cough in order to avoid vaccine-related braindamage.Being concerned abnut both the disease and thevaccine, we can work in an informed and balanced way tosafeguard our children's health.' Ir.DPT's Ten PrinciplesIn our July 1983 testimony before this Ccamittee, Dissatisfied ParentsTogether set forth ten principles for achieving this \"Middle Grot$\". Wecalled these principles for distinguishing genuine \"vaccine victim compen-sation\" legislation fran proposals which, in practical effect, would be\"vaccine victim condemnation\" bills. These ten principles are re-statedbelow: 1.The bill should expressly acknowledge that pertussisvaccines can, and in acme instances do, cause serousreactions, including seizures, brain damage, even death. 7.The bill must not simply be an effort to sweep theOnT-vaccine problem under the rug. Ccepensating those whoare injured by the vaccine and continuing to requirevirtually all children to take this admittedly \"dirty\"vaccine is not an acceptable solution. The bill shouldcontain positive camnitments and incentives to reduce therisks of reactions to the current vaccine and to pramntedeoalopment of safer vaccines. As a minimum theseoomnitnents and incentives should include: requirements foradequate written information to parents on the risks of thevaccine and on the contraindications to the vaccine:adequate reasodkeeping and reporting by doctors end clinicsdiving the vaccine: more stringent quality control andtesting requirements by manufacturers; and more leniency indefining categories of high risk children who should not berequired to receive the vaccine. 3.The bill must not restrict in'any way a parent's forchild's) right to 5110 under existing law.The choice as towhether to sue under existing law or to seek this new formof carpensation should belong entirely to the parents. 4.The bill must provide an opportunity for effectiveepensation for all seriously vaccine-injured individuals,regardless of how long ago the injury may have occurred. 6 1s 57 5.The bill should provide a relatively simple, speedy,inexpensive, non-adversarial mechanism for ccreeneation of vaccine-damaged children. 6.The bill should retain safeguards to assure that the award of onmpensation will not depend on proof by the claimant of who the vaccine manufacturer was: on proof of negligence by the doctor or defect in the vaccine: nr disproof of allpossible alternative explanationn for the child's injuries.The bill should guarantee a level of compensation which isadequate to enable the damaged child to realize his or hermaximum potential and enjoyment of life. Allowable eeeeensation must not be limited by any arbitrary fixed dollar ceiling or by the current availability of services for lack thereof) to meet the vaccine-injured children's needs. A.The bill must define allowable compensation as being available for the life of the injured person in the case of permanent injuries, and as covering all necessary medical, rehabilitation, special education, therapy, behavioral and emotinnal counseling, custodial care, residential placement and other necessary expenses. At a minimum compensationshould also be provided fer the victim's loss of earned income and pain and wafering: and in the case of a child's death being caused by the vaccine, a substantial death benefit payment should be provided for the parents. 4.The persons and institutions deciding vaccine-damagecompensation cleans under the new optional approach must be completely independent of any governmental or private agencyresponsible for promoting vaccines or for controlling health care coets. In.The financing mechanism of the bill should assure that thepayment of compensation awards will not be deferred or reduced because of budget deficits or government program \"rut-hacks.\"while the Tteasury should be the ultimatebeck-stop to assure timely and complete payment ofelmpeneation, those who have benefitted frnm the vaccination requirements should have primary responsibility to finance the system.The financing sys-em should he designed to recover costs from resenneible parties in any cases ofvaccine-inlury due to negligence in the manufacture oradministration of the vaccine or to defect in the vaccine itself. 58 Tr!. Assessrent of S. 2117% flow ft Measures Up to the Ten Principles we are pleased to say that we believe S. 2111 Insets all ten ofthese principles, and thus Dissatisfied Parents Toeother would supportenactment of S. 2117. We do not gay this without reservation or'concerns, however And these conferna need to be clearly noted. Butbefore we do, several key points need to be made about the strengthsof this bill.We are particularly pleased by Parts C and D of the bill.Together, these provisions will create statutory trandates..fordevelopment and use of safer vaccines and for strengthening of thecurrent system to prevent serious vaccine reactions.These mandateswill create non-discretionary duties. If the Secretary of HMS failsto use the authority she has under any law to achieve these goals, anit.--ze suit may be filed and the courts could mandamus the Secretaryto act.Likewise, these parts of the bill mandate certain safeguards tobe carried out by doctors and other health care providers.These newduties would become part of a physician's \"standards of practice orcare.\"Any failure to carrry out their mandated responsibilitieswould at least create a presumptive.% of negligence. A pattern ofrefusal or failure to implement the law could lead to punitive damagesunder tort law law or be considered in licensureereview proceedings.we are please to nate that the State Legislature of Maryland hasrecently passed legislation which is very similar to Part C ofS. al17.we else want. to point out the Unportance of the procedural andadicial reveiw provisions of S. 2117. The vaccine lioensure primesand vaccine policy process have not in the past been open to thepublic.Parent input has not only not been solicited/ when offered,it has frequently been totally ignored.The presently closed systemneeds to be open and accountable, and these provisions for proceduralnpenness and judicial review will help produce healthier children anda better system.Without Parts C and D of S. 2117, Dissatisfied Parents Togetherwould be unable to support the bill. Ccmpensation without \"prevention\"it i aafeguards would simply sweep the problem under the rug. We thinkin fact that the single greatest strength of the bill is its oiler)iknnwledgment that there is a problem and it needs tie he dealt We also want to applaud the bill's sponsors for insuring thatvaccine enmpensation decision-making in individual cases is left tothe federal court. MPS has institutional conflicts of interest byreason of its cost containment and vaccine prcvotion responsibilitiesthat weild preclude it trnm deciding fairly whether a claimantaLliifies for compensation and if 90, for how much. 'I 59 we also ccmmend S. 211/, because it guarantees a child's Lion to sue under traditional =son law principles. It would be taltreustice to require vaccination 'y law knowing that some childrenwell be permanently brain damaged as a result, then to single outthese children to take away their right to common law protection fromnegligence or unreasonably dangerous products. Nor would this be good social policy.The tort/contract system, even with the limits wepointed out in our testimony in July 1983, does serve to deter negli-gence and help augment regulatory teeentives for safety. Dissatisfied Parents Together (DPT)could not support, in fact would have to oppose,enactment of any bill which did not guarantee a child's option to sueunder the traditional eeeeeel law priniples of tort and contract.rv.Kee Issues and ConcernsThe Cammittee should know, of course, that Dissatisfied ParentsTogether (1310T) does not claim to represent all parents concerned about pertussis and pertussis vaccine. Nor are all the parents in our groupunited in their support for S. 2117. There appear to be two mainconcerns about the bill that warrant particular attention.First, some parents feel that the \"onmpensation\" provisions ofthe bill will he used by HHS and state health agencies to continue(and even strengthen) certain deplorable coercive practices. Theyhear Secretary Hecker say, without qualification, that it is \"childabuse\" to fail to vaccinate children. They see state school andhealth officials suing parents for \"child neglect,\" \"child abuse,\" and \"truancy,\" when the parents, in fear for their children's health,refuse to have their musceptible children inoculated. They see stateAttorneys general suing to take guardianship of children to forcibly eace.nate them when parents refuse. These parents fear that the\"ecreensation\" part of S. 2117 will be used as a justification for theindiscriminate use of the current pertussis vaccine, even in the faceof principled objection by parents. They fear health officials will brush aside their concerns by saying, \"we'll ccueensate your child ifhe's ireured -- so you can't ob:)ect.\"ee are not proposing specific solutions or amendments to meetthis set of concerns at this time. But we think these concernsAP%Prir to be addressed, and we would be pleased to work with theCnrmattee and those parents who have most strongly voiced theseeeneerns to assure that the compensation provisions will not be used13green light for gOverhennt coercion.The second ma-or parent concern with the compensation part of thehillis theof that it may somehow let \"culpable physicians anddrug the hook\" and put 'ke taxpayer \"on the hookinstead.\"we do not share this belief. That, is because the billpreeer/es, seen guarantees, the parent's option to sue under ceannon,w end it pee'e!es for edbrngatinn and authorizes erug nompanins or physicians in appropriates cases.Neenrehelees, we share the concern that this bill not act as a ehielef-'r r:e enmpane arm) physician wrongdoing or unreasonably dangerous so products.Again, we would be pleased to work tieand the Committee to provide necessary and appropriate safeguards inthe bill.Other parent concerns appear to us to warrant sand furtherdiscussion.See, for example, attachment 61 (Letter from Daniel E.Pesciniti to Jeff Schwartz, 12/17183, re S. 21171. Bearing theseconcerns in mind, Dissatisfied Parents Tegethem favors CempensationAct.' v.A Closing MoteThe development and deepening of congressional concern about thecontinuing tragedy of vaccine-induced damage is most welcome. Withyour aid, we hope Anon to reach the time when mothers and fathers willnever again say: \"They did this to our child, then they left us aloneto deal with the damage.\"But hope is one thing, and reality is another. Every day thestatus quo continues, we get more unutterably sad phone calls andletters from parents whose children have been maimed or killed. Astop must L. put to this American tragedy as soon as we can. Theam we prnpnee is not to deny or ignore the dangers of whoopingcough.Rut surely denial of these children is rot the answer either.Yea, we are making slow orogress. But for same of us progressry* he fast enough. One year ago when I testified, I noted thateven with nur dew:1liter.s seizure disorder, motor problems, hyper-activity and speech ispairTtrnt, at least we were luckier than theparents whose children had died from the vaccine.That was one year ago. Six weeks ago, JUlie died from a cardiacarrest, suffered during status epilepticus reediting from her Der-induced uncontrolled seizure disorder. Now it is too late for Julie.And it is too late for so man other children -- fifty years too late.Rut it is not too late or tomorrow's children.At Tulip's funeral, we read a poem for her: \"I Carry Your Heartin my !Team.\"As you consider S. '117, we ask you to do the sameplease, for Julie, for all the injured and dead alildren like her, and!rest of all for tomorrow's children, please \"Carry These Children inY,ur Rear's.\" 6 61 Attachment 1 DANIEL E. RESCINITI3 Goethe Street, Binghamton, New York13905607-729-3934 December 12, 1983 Jeff Schwartzc/o OPT Box 5631377 K Street NWWashington, DC 20005Dear Jeff: RE: S-2117I want to thank you for the courtesy you extended to me in our phone conversa- tion on December 3, 1983, and again express my gratitude to the DPT group for the efforts put forth in negotiating the needs of vacc,ie- injured children. Senators Paula Hawkins and Orrin Hatch, having introduced S-2117, confirm that side-effects do occur following routine vaccine immunization and that victim compensation is necessary.Having gone through the past twenty years with two of my sons injured by OPT, the hardships, both emotional and financial, cause me to ask questions and offer a few suggestions: 1.A form and pre-addressed envelope to the CDC should be given to parents to report any adverse reaction fcllowing immunizations. The CDC should acknow- ledge receipt of such a notice within ten (10) days to the parent(s). The CDC should monitor and report, at ten (10) day intervals, all reported vac- cine \"eactions to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.Accordingly, this should not be a burden if, in fact, the statistics, as published to date, are correct.The insurability for unrelated health care should be guaranteed for life. \"his should be broad coverage and should include all dental as well as all .nedications for conditions from acne to ingrown toe nails. My experience with Medicare, Medicaid, and insurance companies -- \"This is covered, this is not,\" is an unnecessary hardship.:n my particular case, medication has not and does not control the convul- ,ive seizures or spacicity my sons experience. I find this unacceptable and therefore 1 look to the medical pioneers.Pres.ntly, and for the past two and one-half years, a prominent research neurosurgeon is precluded from implanting cerebellum stimulators as a means of controlling seizures by the ipA.the stimulator is permitted under investigation (experimentally) for Lrrebal oalsy patients. Of these CP patients, many also have seizures. :mvlantation of the stimulator has proven successful it reducing the spaci- :t, an have diminished or have entirely abated.It seems that :4t166 62 tne FDA's interest in the public at large eclipses the need of orphan drugsand medical devises due to the rigid protocol it has established. The FDAwill allow the use of the obsolete devise that is worn externally (Grand-father Rule), however, the newer implantable devise remains under review.Essentially, my suggestion is that a research doctor be permitted to use.,by prescription, medical devises to improve the quality of life in his/herPatient once accepted by the patient or the patient's guardian and that theFDA 4alve its strict protocol under specified circumstances. 4.A child who becomes damaged and who is eligible ur,der the bill may liveforty years, plus or minus. Does the death benefit of $300,000-700,000remain or is indexing incorporated due to inflation or deflation? 5.Hypothetically, the 10-year option is selected, $250,000 is placed in theinitial trust. The child dies one year later. Expenses were $25,000.happens tohe $225,000 remaining In the trust? Is the death benefitsirate from this balance? 6.I have begun legal action concerning OPT-related injury. 1 now elect tocome under the Compensation Act. Who would pay the already incurred legalexpenses?The provision to appeal is unclear to me and does not address a time limitfor a decision once an appeal is made. 8.If an appealis made through an attorney, who pays the attorney, win orlose? 9.false claims and possible corruption are always a possibility. Will theJustice Department police this bill and apply mechanisms to ensure theprimary intent of he bill? 11.Is tne panel or Fedfr..:1 Magistrate subject to income di_closure? II.AII,;w4nces for developme:t of safer vaccines is mentioned. Canfor possibler;i!netic research\" be included?If the 10-year option is selected, say $250,000, and the trust is exhaustedwer eight years due to unforeseen expenses with the next two years becomingevPn more expensive, who subsidizes these unforeseen and unexpected costs? 13.Paront transpJrtatimi and lodging to various medical centers for treatmentraiould be separate from trust options and be paid as needed. 14.The costs to administer this Compensation bill should be budgeted and moni-tored by Congress.-y intPritions are not to discredit the hill as submitted, however, my sug-iPsfl:m%,iuPstions. and ccrcerns are being made available to you for comparisonwith ,..i.;.orns otter parents to adequately meet the needs of injured vaccine.1,1.'1! jou !osire pf any of 74.-.n!!;A 4 vo' 63Senator HAWKINS. Thankyou, Jeff. You are to be commended forbeing such a leader in this whole movement, and possibly because of your keen interest and leadership we will be able to solve this problem for other children, and little Julie would not have died in vain.Mrs. Gary, grandmother ofa child who had problems with this vaccine, would you like to tell us about it?STATEMENT OF DONNA GARY, WAYLAND, MAMrs. GARY. Thankyou, and good morning, Senator Hawkins.My name is Donna Gary. Iam a constituent of Senator Kenne- dy's from Massachusetts.Our family should have celebrated our very first granddaughter's first birthday last month. Instead, we will commemorate the anni- versary of her death the end of this month.Our granddaughter, Lee Ann, was just 8 weeks old when her mother took her to the doctor for her routine checkup. That includ- ed, of course, her first DPT inoculation and oral polio vaccine. In all her entire 8 weeks of life this lovable, extremely alert baby had never produced sucha blood-curdling scream as she did at themoment the shot was given. Neither had her mother ever before seen her back arch as it did while she screamed. She was inconsol- able. It was even difficult for her mother to drive them home for daddy's consolations while she went to the pharmacy. She needed to purchase the infant Tylenol the doctor suggested for the baby if she developed a possible slight fever. Even her daddy could notun- der.stand Lee Ann's uncharacteristic screaming and crying. Four hours later Lee Annwas dead. \"Crib death,\" the doctor said. \"SIDS.\" \"Could it shot?\" plored. \"No.\" \"She just hadher first DPV shot possibly beany connection to it?\" \"No, no connectionat all,\" the emergency room doctor said definitely.My husband and I hurriedto the hospital the following morningafter Lee Ann's death to talk with the pathologist before the autop- sy. We wanted to make sure he was alerted to her DPT inoculation such a short time before her deathjust in case, just in case there was something else he could look for to make the connection. He was unavailable to talk with us. We waited, waited 21/2 hours. We never even had any confirmation that the pathologist even knew we were there. Finally, we got to talk to another doctor after the autopsy had been completed. He said, \"It was SIDS.\" In the months before Lee Ann was horn I regularly checked with a friend as to the state of her grandchild's condition. He is nearly a year and a half older than Lee Ann. On his first DPT shot he passed out cold for 15 minutes, right in the pediatrician's office. \"Norma: reaction forsome children,\" the pediatrician reassured.The parent:, were scared, but they knew what a fine d,:ctor they had. They trusted his judgment.When it was time for the second shot they asked, \"Are yousure its all right? Isit really necessary? Was the last time that Jona- than was unconscious for 15 minutes really nothing toworry about? He's only 4 months old.\" 6S Ii4Thcir pediatrician againreassi red them. lie told them howawful it was to experience, as he had, one of his infant patient'sbout with whooping cough. That baby had died from whoopingcough.Jonathan had his second DINT shot that day. Jonathan becamebrain-damaged.The parents learned from their own research later that thedoctor should have checked the family's neurological history. Jona-than's mother has a form of epilepsy. A history in the family ofthis should be a contraindication' for a baby to receive pertussisvaccine A brain damaged childno connection to the shot, Doctor?Death :s hard for the survivors to live with. Death of a child iseven harder to live with. But death is final and we do somehowmanage to go on living.There is also a living death. Having to be or to be the one to carefor a brain-damaged child, teenager, adult day alter day, monthafter month, year after year, has to be the absolutely most phys-ically straining, emotionally as well as financially draining situa-tion that any human or humans can bear.I understand this hearing is to address the compensation neededto ease at least the financial burden of those who are afflicted withvaccine-related problems. I am in full agreement with the Dissatis-fied Parents Together presentation of that part of the issue andwill List this time temphasize those points that are as equally im-portant in this bilSo many qons came to mind thiough the loss of our preciousgrandchild.

No connec- tion, really'? No connection'?No wonder doctorscan believe no connection, if this is the typeof conclusion drawn in a scientific study.If my comprehension level isaccurate in what I read, I believe the .Japanese people refused the pertussis vaccine their Govern- ment provided because of only two deaths in 1975. How were they able to research so quicklya safer and, apparently, effective vac-cine that they are now using? Where is our \"esearch at this point? When will we have a safer pertussis vaccine?At this same 1982 hearing Dr. Vincent Fulginiti of the American Academy of Pediatrics criticizes the television program, \"DPT, Vac- cine Roulette,\" aired here in the Washington area. He says, on page 111, \"We at the American Academy of Pediatrics believe itimperative that such sensationalism not go unchallenged.\" He then goes on to enumerate statistics including, unchallenged.\"can cause brain damage in as many as one child in 8,000.\"'low accurate are our statistics on adverse reactions to vaccine, Dr. Fulginiti, when parents have been told, are still being told, \"No connection to the shot, no connection at all.\"What about the mother I have recently talked with who has a 4- year -old brain-damaged son? On all three of his DPT shots he hada convulsion in the presence of the pediatrician. \"No connection,\"the pediatrician assured.This mother believed the doctor, wondered what had caused her son to lose all motor control. She lived with this situation for a year and a half. Then she saw the Phil Donahue television pro- gram on vaccine reactions which I assume was a result of the local show in Washington that Dr. Fulginiti called sensationalism. This mother needed help. The doctor had told her, \"No connection to t he shot.- She finally calledan acquaintance who is a lawyer.Who else is in a similar condition and has not had the opportuni- ty to see the sensationalism of a TV program and still believes t here is no connection to their own child's problem from a vaccine'? Another acquaintance heardon a +21evision program that it is important to record the manufacturer's name and lot number of the vaccine's being administered to children; for one of the reasons, n case it might he necessary to recall a lot considered a \"hot lot.\" Why did she have to tolerate almost a sneer as well as a sarcastic remark from her doctor while he reluctantly followed her request? Apparently. it does take a Federal law for some doctors to do the .)nviousItis hard to imagine that doctors do not automatically record ad-' erse reactions to vaccines on the patients' charts, but, again, itnee(o be spelled out in law to make it happen. These reactionsmu-4 also he reported to a central agency in order to accumulatemore accurate figuresI find it hard to believe that in this comput- I111.01 fifiear age a system of accurate statistics cannot be effected in a simpli-fied manner.I talked with a father in a town adjoining ours whose son died atthe age of 9 weeks, several months before our own granddaugh'er'sdeath. It was the day after his DPT inoculation. \"SIDS\" is thestatement on the death certificate.Their pediatrician is a teaching professor at Harvard MedicalSchool. These parents had another baby this past winter. It was ontheir own insistence that the baby be given only the DT and notthe \"P\" in her routine inoculations. The doctor saw absolutely noconnection between their other child's shot and death. The parentsare not that positive. The doctor teaches our coming generation ofdoctors.Are the statistics that the medical world loves to quote to say,\"There is no connection,\" really accurate, ur are they based onpoor diagnoses, poorrecordkeeping'?Ifitis true that adverse reactions to pertussis vaccine are sovery rare, how can one ordinary person like me know about:No. 1, a personal friend whose grandchild is brain-damaged dueto pertussis.No. 2, our own daughter's child, dead within 4 hours of her firstDrr shot.I have learned within the past few months that the sig-nificant type of scream, arching of the back, and unnatural limp-ness Lee Ann experienced are called encephalopathic manifesta-tions.No. 3, an acquaintance in an adjoining town whose baby diedwithin 24 hours of DIYI' inoculation.No. 4, the 4-year-old brain-damaged child in Canton, MA, whoconvulsed on all three DPT shots in the doctor's presence.No 5,I have not previously mentioned Debbie and Steve, whoare at this hearing now.

The medi- cal associationsseem so quick to squelch even their own doctors when these doctors tryto point out their own research and discov- eris of the problems that exist.I admire those doctors whoquestion what has been and still is happening. I would liketo include with my testimony a report from the Physicians for Study of Pertussis Vaccines,a group of physicians in California whoare much concerned with this prob-lem of pertussis vaccine. The report is wi itten by Kevin C. Ger-aghty, M.D., and is entitled, \"Death Events Following DPT in Northern California.\"Today is the National Day ofPrayer. My prayer is that this com- mittee be instrumental in doing what needs to be doneand soon. May there not be yet another year pass by with more children af- flicted and some dead because those who can doso refuse to \"make the right connection.\"Thank you for the privilegeof speaking to thisgroup.

Senator Hawkins and members of the Committeeon Labor and Human Resources, unlike the other two parents on this panel who have had their children either killed or damaged by complying with the mandatory vaccination program of their States, I don't yet have a vaccine-damaged child and I don't want one. My name is Stephen Kudabeck. I reside in Hot Springs, AR.My wife and I have six healthy, beautiful children who havenever been vaccinated for anything, although it is the law in Ar-kansas that all parentshe are not officially recognized as mem- bers of she Christian Science Church must have their children vac- cinated for seven childhood diseases. My wife and I are not Chris- tian Scientists. We do not intend to change our religion just to escape the penalties of this heinous law.I view this battle not just as a man-to-man-type combat. Thereare two forces involvedthe forces of good and evil. We have theGod I worship versus the god of pseudoscience; the god of compul-sion versus my God who gave me inalienable rights and responsi-bilities to protect my children.We have been asked to voluntarily offer our healthy children as living sacrifices to a false god. The God I worship demands obedi-ence rather than sacrifice.I respectfully submit that there are many scientists and physi- cians who feel as I do. For some reason unknown to me, not a single one of these scientists or doctors has been invited or allowed to testify today in opposition to 2117. A partial list of these cou- rageous scientists and medical doctors follows:No. 1, Dr. Richard de Long, professor of biology at Del Mar Col-lege, Corpus Christi, TX.

Followingare just a few of the many quotes regarding vaccines that should beacknowledped and perhaps pondered upon, for these findings, too, cangroatly affect the lives of our children and those of future gencationa.GENETIC MANIPULATIONBut an even greater threat exist, tomankind horn the used vaccines...athreat that dwarfs even such problemsasbraindamage and ctipplingparalystsIt Y the potential geneticdamage and harm to the future ofmankind that could result horn the useof vaccines Dr Richard De Long, Pro-fessor ofBiologyat Del Mat College inCorpus Chnsu, Texas summarized hisrsearch in a letter which appeared InScience News.

Both have produced some undesired effects.MEDICINE Live virus vaccinesbenefactors withacatchNo one deniesthat live viral vaccines have saved millions of livesand prevented other millions of people from being crippled for life.For public health, they have provided a control of disease unattain-able otherwise.But there it another side of the story. Medicalscientists do not know, in many instances, the long rangeandsometimes immediateeffects that immunizing live viral vaccineswill have on human cells.In a few crises, unusual effects areheginningto show up and suspicions are growing. Most distressingis-lirepossibility that live viral vaccines maychange the structureof living cells, including the hereditary material that is the fountain-head of life.Thr author of this article, Dr. Richard Detong, is an associatepro/cm)r of biology at the University of Trued\u00b0. His research inthe viral approach to human leukemia has revealed to him cluesthat impel him to sound an alarm. The views expressed in thisarti(Ir are his, based on his awn studies, and represent one side ofa subject vital to all.

Viruses are so intimatelyassociated with the cells they infectthat many times they incorporatetheir hereditary materialinto thehereditary themselvesindit(erent ways, depending on en-vironmental and cellular conditions.Viruses have the ability to infectcells is called active; active infection.viruses enter a cell and begin re-producing almost immediately. Thenew viruses are released from thecell and can infect others.In latent infection, viruses entera cell but do not begin they manner, cellformed from a virally-infected cellcontains the hereditary material ofthe infecting virus. An appropriatestimulation from the environmentcauses the latent virus in the cell tobecome active, and it starts repro-ducing newly-formed viruses whichare eliminated from the cell. Allthe stimuli which might induce alatent virus to become active are'hot known: some thatare: radia-tion, heat, cold, certain chemicals.Both active and latent virusescan act upon cells in different ways.There are atleast three possibleresults when cells become infectedwith reproduction of the cellsor no apparent no apparent effect may heaffected, however.There may hechromosomal defects or even moresubtle defects which could be in-herited by succeeding generationsofcells.Chromosomes carry thegenes or hereditary units. and anychange in one or more of these unitsis inherited by the cell's offspring.Viruses can be transmitted fromgenerationtogenerationthroughthe sperm or egg, the placenta andmaternal milk.Viruses used in live vaccines areno exception in all this.Vaccines may be classified as oftwo typeslive or killed.A livevaccine contains infectious viruses.though most of them are \"attenu-ated,\"which means they have been4changed to weaken or abolish theirvirulencefor a particulardisease.Science DigestJanuary. 1960 9'1 A killed viral vaccine contains non-infectious viruses. Both confer pro-tection on a vaccinated individual.However,theliveviralvaccinestimulates the production of anti-bodies in humans causing a genuineviralinfectionintheindividual.The killed vaccine stimulates anti-body production without infection.Some of the more important po-tential hazards of using live viralvaccines include the following: (1)damage or death to developing em-bryos, (2) possible cancer produc-tion, (3) possible initiation of newdiseases.(4)possible genetic de-fects, (5) presence in the vaccinesof \"passenger\" viruses which maybe harmful.Itis well-known that some vi-ruses can caw.... death or damageto developing human embryos ifthe mother becomes infected duringpregnancy.

Dr. Wilbur Downs, saying, \"Nothinglike (the disease)has ever beenwen before. It appears to be amongthe most dangerous agents knownto man\"Investigators are trying to tracethe whereabouts of 2,000 green mon-keys used in making the U.S. em-bargoed lots of oral polio vaccine.Green monkeys from Uganda wereidentified as the source of the mys-terious illness that struck 30 per-sons in West Germany. killing sevenof them. Most of the Germans af-flicted were laboratorytet hnicansinvolved in obtaining monkey kid-ney tissue for culturing the poliovaccine viruses.A spokesman for the division ofbiological standards of the Nation-alInstitutes- of Health. Bethesda,Md., confirmedreportsthattheembargo had been placed on theSabin vaccine produced since lastJuly. The agency added that sup-plies of the vaccine produced priorto July were in sufficient supply tomeet all demands. The agency add-ed that none of the green monkeysbrought into the U.S. were fromUganda and the animals were inquarantineseveralweekslongerthan the four-to-nine day incuba-tion for the so-called greenmonkey fever.

Vac-cinia virus, the live virus used invaccinating for smallpox, has beenknown to cause abnormalities ordeath in human embryos when themother had been2vaccinated duringpregnancy.Recently, it has beenfound that the attenuated 11poliovirus (used in the Sabin livepoliomyelitis vaccine) causes injuryand death to cultured human em-byronic cells.\" The possibility ex-ists then that viruses used in liveviral vacci:tes could infect and af-fect embryos.Cancer in animalsIt is now established that certainviruses have the ability to causecancer in some animals. Ac yet, noabsolute proof has been found thatviruses can cause human cancer.but evidence is accumulating thatsome viruses may.If this shouldbe found to be true, then infectiousviruses used in vaccines might alsopossess cancer-inducing propertiesLive adenovirus vaccines are beingdevelopedfor human vaccinationAdenovirus, type 12, a human respiratory virus now being used ex-perimentally in vaccines for somerespiratory ills (not flu), is knownto cause cancer when injected intolaboratory animals.Viruses in live vaccines often arechanged so that they will no longercause the particular disease againstwhich they are being used. Duringthis changing process. however, theviruses may be changed in other36103EXHIBIT4p.4 ways.Itispossiblethatthesechanges might,insome viruses,cause entirely new diseases in hu-mans.Perhaps the most insidiousunknown factor inthe live viralvaccine picture, however, lies in thefield genetics.Genetic defects are inherited.Viral infection can causemany genicand changes in cells.If the germinal cells of humans be-came infected by viruses, they couldcause genetic abnormalities in thesex cells of humans. Any defectivesperm or egg would transfer itsdefects to the offspring. Virusesare known to cause chromosomalbreaks, deletions, pulverizations. in-%Tr-ions and abnormal chromosomalnumbers in cells. Any of these oc-curring ina sperm or egg couldcause abnormalities in succeedinggenerations. The viruses used in livemeasles viral vaccine cause manychromosomal abnormalities in hu-man cells.These have been foundboth in cells taken from vaccinatedhumans and from human cells inculture which were infected withthe measles viruses used in the in to causechromosomal abnormalities in cul-tured human cells.The effects of live viral vaccinesfor any of the above mentioned po-tentialhazardsareseldom thor-oughly tested. The United StatesPublic Health Service does not re-quire testing for any of these pos-sible dangers.'Science NestJanuary. 1968 99\"Passenger viruses\" are sometimes found in cells .being used to cultivate viruses for vaccines. The production oftjive viral vac-cines requires a living cell system.It is possible that the cells used tocultivate viruses for vaccines maybeinfected already with viruses.These viruses are called \"passengerviruses.\"Passenger viruses mightbe harmful to humans. The livepoliomyelitis vaccine had .been ad-ministered to many millions of peo-ple before it was discovered thatthe vaccine also contained a viruswhich was present in the monkeykidney cells that were used to cul-tivate the polio viruses for the vac-cine. Since then, this virus, calledSimian virus 40, has been found toproduce cancer in laboratory ani-mals, cause chromosomal abnormal-ities in cultured human cells andcause cultured human cells to betransformed to malignant cells.` Sofar such phenomena have not beenobserved in the human bodybutthat doesn't mean it can't happen.A live mumps vaccine, which isin the experimental stage now butwill be introduced on the marketshould human trials proveitef-fectiveinpreventing mumps,ismade by using live chicken cells..Chicken cell3 serve as hosts for theleukosis viruses. These viruses causevarious forms of malignant diseasesin chickens such as sarcoma, leu-kemia and osteopetrosis.So far,no proof exists that the same vi-ruses can cause the same diseases inhumans, but they are beginning toScissroto Digest January. 1966be suspected. The leukosis virusesare extremely common inhabitantsof chicken cells and may be carriedin chicken cells in the latent state.Recently, Dr. Philip A. Brunel!of New York University School ofMedicine said there was some dif-ference of opinion over duration ofprotection of the live virus mumpsvaccine developed by a researchteam led by Dr. Maurice R. Hille-man of Merck Institute of Thera-peutic Research. Dr. Brunel! point;ed out that natural mumps infec-tion is believed to give nearly lifelong protection. If children receivea vaccine giving immunity for onlyseveral years, they might be sus-ceptible again in young adulth6od,when the illness can be most severeThe vaccine is expected to be on themarket shortly after the first of theyear.It would be very difficult, if notimpossible, to detect with certaintythe presence of all latent viruses incells. The live measles vaccine wasmade by cultivatingthe measlesvirus in chicken and dog kidneycells.It is known that many ani-mal viruses can be transmitted tohumans and cause diseases in humans.It behooves us then not totake chances concerning the possi-bility of transferring passenger viruses to humans through vaccination.Before the discovery of passenger viruses in the live poliormelitisvaccine,notestshadbeen 10437 100 made for these viruses in the pro-duction of live viral vaccines.None of these dangers exist inkilled viral vaccines. The rush toproduce human vaccines containinglive viruses is distressing to manyvirologists(there are many liveviral vaccines in the experimentalstage at the present time). A liveviral vaccine should be used onlyif no effective killed viral vaccinecan be developed.However, thishas not been the case. Rather, liveviral vaccines are being publicizedand advocated for use over that ofproveneffectivekilledviralvac-cines. Examples are the live Sabinpoliomyelitis vaccine over that ofthe killed Salk poliomyelitis vaccineand the live measles vaccine the killed measles vaccine.Insteadof developing moreliveviralvaccines,efforts could andshould in the opinion of appliedto developing effective killed viralvaccines and administering thesefor vaccination.It takes no genius to realiLe thefar-reaching effect\"; that these potential hazard; could have on mankindshould they exist, andithas notbeen shown that they do not exist.Perhaps mankind has been lucky,and the live vaccines administeredalready will not...produce any ill ef-fects human population.hope so Vet, this cannotbe a...sumo!

The course that shouldbe taken now is to stop introducingnew live viral vaccines without ade-quate testing.I am not against vaccination. Infact, I am one of the strongest ad-vocates of vaccination and preven-tive medicine. My plea is simpledo not use live viral vaccines wheneffective killed vaccines are avail-able.The scientific and medical com-munity, as a whole, and especiallyvirologists,immunologists,geneti-cists, embryologists, cancer research-ers, physicians and public healthworkers should be greatly concernedabout live viral vaccination.The publiclargely uninformedon subject to datemust beprotected against appealisto scientists and the medical pro-fessionto questionthe safety oflive viral vaccination until they areutterly 3atisfied that no harm cancome to mankind through its use.1Bablanian, R., Eggers, IL, Tamm,I.Virology; 1965, 26, 100-113.2Bablanian, R., Eggers, H., Tamm,I.Virology, 1965, 26, 114-121.'Nichols, W.

No foreign substancesshould be introduced to a human's body without that human's consent. Vaccinesare foreign substances to a human body and, thus they should not be made man- datory.To do so is wrong.All vaccines are inherent with a certain amount of danger and the risksinvolved on whether to take a vaccine -or not should be the decision of theintended recipient and no one else. Some vaccines bre more dangerous thanothers and the most dangerous type of vaccine is the attenuated (live) viralvaccine.Attenuated viral vaccines are inherent with many very serious dangers.I will list some of these dangers for you: (1) the vaccine viruses mayrevert to virulence and cause the very disease for which the vaccine had beenmeant to prevent, (2) the vaccines may be contaminated with other viruses andthese viruses could cause disease, (3) the vaccine viruses could cause cancer,(4) the vaccine viruses could cause mutations, (5) the vaccine viruses couldcause chromosomal aberrations, (6) the vaccine viruses could cause birthdefects, (7) the vaccine viruses could cause new diseases.Attenuated, or live, viral vaccines contain live, infectious viruses.These viruses infect the body's cells. They can infect cells in three dif- ferent ways:(1) active infection, (2) masked infection and (3) latent infection.So, in reality, mandatory vaccination is forcing people to becomeinfected with viruses without any choice on their wt. These viruses can betransmitted from generation to generation in human; by a variety of ways:(1) through the human egg. (2) through the human sperm, (3) through the 106 102 EXHIBIT 4p.7 human placenta and (4) through human maternal milk. In effect, we areperforming biological pollution of humans,On purpose whin we make people re-ceive these vaccines. We are seeding not only the present generations but ,'future generations, as well, with viruses of known and unknown potential harm.This may be unbelievable but it is true! Our knowledge of viruses andviral infection is so meager, at present, that we should proceed with greatcaution about anything involving viruses. Yet, we are blindly administeringthese viruses en masse to humans mandatorily. Any virologist, worthy ofbearing that name, should know that infectious vaccine viruses are inherentwith many dangers to a recipient. Such mandatory vaccination should be stoppedimmediately! Ihave been critical of attenuated viral vaccination for the last twenty-four years and in those twenty-four years the knowledge and experience gained,during that time, has confirmed all of my fears about these vaccines.At present, there are four attenuated viral vacines which are mandatoryin most states of this country. They are required before Children may enterpublic school. These vaccines are the attenuated poliomyelitis vaccine (Sabin),the measles (rubella) vaccine. Iwill list for you some of the dangers in these vaccines. These arefacts which we know now about 'these vaccines: I.Sabin Vaccine (live polio vaccine) 1.It causes many mutations. 2.It causes many chromosomal aberrations. 3.It causes cancer in laboratory animals. 4.it causes cancer in cultured human cells. 5.It reverts to virulence. 1.07 *103 EXi !IT 4p. 8 6.It contained, at first, a contaminating virus called the SV40.Many millions were infected with SV40. 7.It kills human embryonic cells.This is what is known now about SV40. 1.It causes many mutations. 2.It causes many chromosomal aberrations. 3.It causes cancer tn laboratory animals. 4.It Causes cancer in cultured human cells. 5.It kills human embryonic cells.

'let the very purpose ofthis vaccine is to prevent birth defects, Thee is the poosibility, also, that mandatory attenuated viral vaccinationmay be the cause of the surge in new diseases arising in the world. In thelast twenty years about a dozen new diseases hpve arisen on this planetwhich never existed before in this world, The time of onset of them. new .diseases correlates well with` the time of initiation of nandatory attenuatedviral vaccination en masse to the public. .The fad of administering attenuated viral vaccines began in 1961 with theSat,in poliomyelitis vaccine and has continued unabated with many moresattenu-ated viral vaccines being given since that time. The first new disease, calledReyes' vndrome, appeared in 1963. By this time, millions of humans had beenvaccinated with the Sabin vaccine.These new diseases may be the result of new viruses being produced inrecipients' cells because of viral gene recombination occurring between two,or more, different viruses infecting the same cell. When this happens adifferent virus is created which will ive different characteristics and,the'efore, could have the ability to cause new disease. Some of the newdiseases which have arisen within the last twenty years, in addition to Reyes'syndrome, are lassa fever, non A-non disease and acc!uired immune deficiency Syndrome (Allis).Millions of humans are now harboring different vaccine viruses withintheir cells making it very probable that v...ral gene recombination can occuramung these vaccine viruses and other infective viruses.Onlyone of these dangers shou'd he enough reason to ban attenuated viral thes.However,wehave made these types of vaccines mandatory and are / a 105 - Introducing them into the bodies of our children. It is appalling andincrediblelThe damage that has been done to humanity already through the massadministration of attenuated '4iral vaccines is incalculable. This damagecould result in genetic defects, malignancies, birth defects, new diseasesand other, as. yet, unknown damage.it is imperative that mandatory attenuated viral vaccination be abolished.The answer, to damages caused by vaccination, is not to be found in insuringrecipients of vaccines, because no amount of money can reimburse for illnessor death, but by abolishing mandatory vaccination. The legislative bodies ofthis country should strive vigorously to enact a law abolishing the administra-tion of all attenuated viral vaccines as soon as possible.Thank you for giving me this opportunity inform you of the dangers ofvaccination.I am must grateful..dc:4)e 4%42 Professor of MicrobiologyRichard de Long, Ph.D. Del Mar CollegeCorpus Christi, Texas 106 SUMMARY DP SERIOUS ADVER iE REACTIONS TO DTPAS REPOUED IN FIR RE:ENT U.S. STUDIES Study HoReactionCry):15/St..-eaming SeizureHiPotoniclty/iworesponLlveness 1 0 0 5505/15752(3%)9/1576210.06 Manufacturer:Results of aSurvey in Montana.

It is dangerously misleading and, indeed, the 'exact opposite of thetruth to claim that a vaccine makes us \"immune\" or protects usagainst an acute disease, if in fact it only drives the disease deeper intothe interior and causes us to harbor it chronically, with the result thatour responses to It become progressively weaker, and show less andless tendency to heal or resolve themselves spontaneously.By RIClised Moskowitz, M.D. WhatIpropose Is simply toinvestigate as thoroughly andobjectively as we can how the vaccinesactually work inside the human body,and to begin by paying attention to theimplications of what we already know.In paniculet,I would like to con-sider in detail the process of 141114with, and recovering from, a typicalacute disease, such as measles, in con-trast with what we can observe follow-ins the administration of the measlesvaccine.We all know that measles is primari-ly a virus of the respiratory tract, bothbecause it a inhaled by susceptible per-sonsunoncontactwithinfecteddroplets in the air, and because thesedroplets are produced by the coughingand sneering of a person with thediseaseOnce inhaled by a susceptible per.son. the measles virus then undergoes along period of silent multiplication,tint in the tonsils, adenoids, and ac-cessory lymphoid tissues or the nasopharynx: later in the regional lymphnodes of the head any neck; andeventually. several days later. it passesinto the blood and enters the spleen,the burr, the thymus. and the honemallow. the \"%nectar organs of thetmmune systemThroughout this -Incubatlon\" period, which lasts from 10to 14 days, the patient usually feelsqu. ;e well, and experiences few or nosymptoms.'By the tints that the first symptomsof measles appear, circulating Intl-bodies are already detectable In bodyin this we haveaccomplished evolvedIn to prevent; wehave the into access tothe major immuneorgans and tissues,without any obviousway of getting rid of it.blood, and the height of the Imptomatoloey coincides with the peak oftheantibodyvsponseInotherwords,the''illness\"issimply thedefinitive effort of the immune systemto clear the virus from the blood.Equally noteworthy Is the fact that thevirusIs eliminated by sneezing andi.e..via the same routekb it entered in the firstNue.ItIs *Admit that the process ofmounting an acute iUneaslike themeasles. no less than recovering fromit, involves a general mobilization ofthe entire Immune systemSuch Illnesses are In fact the decisiveexperiences In the normal physiologicmaturation of the Immune system aswhole in the life of a healthy child. Fornot only will the child who recoversfromthe measlesneveragain besusceptible to It,' such an experiencealso cannot fall to prepare the individual to respond even more prompt-ly and effectively to any infections hemay acquire in the future. The abilityto mount a riotous acute response toorganisms of this type must thereforebe reckoned among the most fun-damentalrequirements ofgeneralhealth and well-being.In contrast, when ar, artificially at-tenuated virus such as measles is in-jecteddirectly Intothe blood, bypassing the normal portal of entry. atmost a brief inflammatory reactionmay be noted at the injection site. or inthe regional lymph nodes; but there isContinued on pose Id 10 HEALTH FREEDOM NEWS 112 _1 108 VACCINECONTINUED FROM PAGE 10no \"incubation period\" or local con-tact at the normal portal of entry and,conrequently, very little possibility oreliminating the virus via the sameroute.Even more important is the Mt thatthe virus has been artificially \"at.tenuated,\" so that It will no loftier in.diate a sperserahrod infirm/story re-sponse, or indeed that helpus to reamed fasikos, wehave acoornpilshed what the entire im-mune system seems to have evolved Inorder to prevent; we have placed thevirus directly into the blood and givenitfree and immediate access to themajor immune organs and tiuues,without any obvious way or getting ridof itThe result is. indeed. the productionof circulating antibodies against thevirus, which can be measured in theblood. but the antibody reseorise nowoccurs as an isolated technical rest,without any generalised Inflammatoryresponse of any noticeable improve-ment inthe general health or theorganism.Exactly the opposite. infact; the price that we have to pay foethose antibodies if the persistence orstrut elements in the blood for pro-longed periods or time, perhaps per.manently, which in turn presupposes asystematic weakening or our ability tomount an effective response not onlyto measles, but also to other acute in.lections as will.I ar from producing a genuine im.mussy. then. the vaccines may act byactually interfering with or Suppressingthe immune response as a whole. inmuih the UMe way that radiation,For from producing agenuine Immunity, thevaccines may act byactually as inflammatory drugs do Aredwal immumiation focuses on atmno.ir production. a single aspect of theimmune process, and dtsarticulates itand allows it to stand for the whole, inmuch the same way as chemical sup-pression of an elevated blood pressureis accepted as a valid substitute foe ag enuine rum of the patient whoseblood pressure has visa.

Because thevirus is now permanently Incorporatedwithin the genetic material of the cell,these antibodies will now have to bedirected against the all itself.The persistence of live viruses orother foreign antigens within the ailsof the host therefore cannot rail to pro-voke auto-immune phenomena. because destroying the infected cells isnow the only possible way that thisconstant antigenic chalien;,e can brremoved from the body.

The issueof compulsory vaccinations and the proposed compensation bill, S.2117, are of great concern to me.It has been said throughout the transcripts of the previous hear-ings and in the proposed bill, S. 2117, that Congress has found thatthere has been a longstanding effort to promote childhood vaccina-tion by the Federal Government and to encourage States to adoptand enforce mandatory preschool vaccination laws. In the openingstatements of the July 22, 1983, hearing you, Senator Hawkins,said that all 50 States have implemented legislation making immu-nization mandatory for school attendance. Because school attend-ance is required by law, parents must have their children immu-nized or face criminal prosecution. Refusing vaccination is difficult,if not impossible.I am the father of six beautiful children. I well know the situa-tion. I am addressing this committee not as a parent of a damagedchild, but as a parent who is at this time being criminally prosecut-ed for not having my three school-age children vaccinated forschool attendance. After attending school for 30 days last fall, theywere barred from school and I was charged with truancy. See ex-hibits A and Al, \"Opposing Compulsory Immunization.\"My wife and I object to vaccines for reasons of personal beliefs,scriptural beliefs, and conviction of conscience. These beliefs havebeen longstanding, over 15 years. Our scriptural beliefs are ourown, not that of a tenet of an organized religion.When damages occur from vaccines, it is a most traumatic expe- rience for a parentheart rendering, to say the least. We have per-sovally wept with parents who once had healthy, active children.Suddenly after their child was immunized, they were faced with achild that had seizures, limpness, and once even death. As all toooften happens, the doctors' reports did not link the child's injuriesor death with the vaccines.There are tnose whose children are not immediately disabled byvaccines. However, these parents have little chance of seeking com- pensation when the vaccine-related injury results in some degree oflearning disability, arthritis, or other maladies that decrease thequality of life. The parentsvmust accept the burden of special tutors41154!I.0 111or therapy. It becomes very difficult to link the causes of these in-juries to vaccines.Are these perhaps the frivolous lawsuits mentioned in the 1980Office of Technology Assessment Report? See exhibit 1, \"Compensa-tion for Vaccine and Related Injuries,\" page 16, paragraph 2. T donot think any parent would call these lawsuits frivolous.A compensation program has been discussed by the Governmentand drug companies since 1979. It was said that, because of thelawsuits brought against drug companies and other parties, whereplaintiffs won large judgments against the drug manufacturers, theOffice of Technical Assessment suggested that it may be desirable to establish a federally operated program to compensate vaccinees..,,,.red as a result of the public immunization program. In the 1980 OTA technical memorandum, the informed consentformssee exhibits 2, 2A, and 2Bwere discussed. The assumptionof the duty to warn was done at the insistence of the vaccine man- ufacturers who would not continue to produce for fear of liability.S. 2117 addresses the need for better information to be dissemi-nated to the parents and to encourage full discussion between thehealth provider, the one who administers the vaccine, and the par- ents.On the \"Important Information Forms\" it states that one has had the opportunity to read the forms and ask questions to theirsatisfaction. It then states that you believe you understand the ben-efits and risks of the vaccines and that you requestI repeat re- questthat these shots be administered to your child. To requestsomething means that you desire it.What is the purpose of wording the form in this manner when a parent has no choice short of vaccination or prosecution? See ex-hibit 3.Request implies that you have been able to make a decision.Duty to warn and informed consent imply that the recipient has aright to refuse. This is not the case, though. The OTA study of 1980reports that getting the parents to take the time to read all the in-formation on the forms has been a problem.From our own experience, we have found that most parents donot read the forms because there is no choice. They have told usthat, even though they question the safety of the shots and wouldrather not have their children get them, if they choose not to havethe shots, they would \"nd up in court, being publicized, ridiculed,or called a radical.If any of you saw the documentary, \"China's Only Child,\" on PBS networks, the same situation will ring a bell. A mother, 6months pregnant with her second child, dearly wanted to keep herbaby. However, without special permission, that becomes almostimpossible. She and her husband were hassled and put before theblock committee, and, finally, under duress, gave in to having anabortion. The mother, with tears in her eyes, letting us know fullwell that she did not want the abortion, was forced into signing aform saying that she requested that the abortion be performed.This story takes place in Communist China.Our story takes place in a democratic society. Is there an urgen-cy to provide better health forms and information sheets because116 112the only way that an injured party can legitimately sue is if they can prove that the Government'd warnings are inadequate?This is what the OTA recart states, page 2, paragraph 1. In- formed consent and duty towarn imply that the potential vaccin-ees can refuse the vaccination. On page 17 of the 1980 OTA reportit states:What is a more serious weakness in the.Government's defense strategy is the con- tention that a properly warned vaccine r^cipient has assumed all risks of injury.Such an argument does not make sense, howeve., unless the vaccinee can refuse the vaccine. But vaccination is mandatory in many states for school entry [which itselfis mandatory] and refusing vaccination in these cases is very difficult.Are parents ever going to be given the right of a true, informed decision? Or, are we going to continue to sign those consent formsunder coercion and duress to help the Government's defense strate- gy and perhaps our Nation's economy? Are we to continue to signthe consent form requesting the drugs under threat of criminalprosecution?At this point the vaccination is not an issue of whether the vac- cines are good off' bad, not an issue of efficacy or safety, but it be- comes an issue of basic human rights.The fact that there is a compensation program being discussed shows that injuries are not that rare. The Comptroller General'sreport of June 1980 states that adverse reactions have been basedon estimates and ball park figures. Clinical studies have been doneon limited numbers.Vaccines, in legal parlance, are known as unavoidably dangerous products. The FDA categorizes them as drugs. Yet, even though they are drugs, there is no personal prescription given to each andevery child vaccinated. Instead, this medical belief is administeredthrough legislative enactment and enforced through police power. I am opposed to S. 2117. It, as well as any other compensation bill, no matter how it is stated, would have the same detrimental effect on people like myself. If the bill passes, the State has a remedy at law for the damage created by the vaccine, therebystrengthening the State's position for mandatory vaccination.To save time of this committee, may I have my written testimony and exhibits made a part of the record?Senator HAWKINS. Surely.Mr. KUDABECK. Thank you, Senator Hawkins.Senator HAWKINS. Thank you very much for helping us.

It may have some spillover into handicapped.Mr. SchwartzJeff, you have really been fantastic in helping us with solving this problem. I really believe that you are another John Walsh in another problem. The cooperation of you and of themediaLee Thompson took an active role in making this known toeveryone, not just the people in this room, and I think that is what117 113it takes to get the message out to the grassroots, so to speak, so the parents have the right to make that decision.You stated in your testimony today that physicians are still not telling the contraindications to the proper authorities or to the par- ents of the pertussis vaccine. What proof do you have that this is true?Mr. SCHWARTZ. Senator Hawkins, you have already heard some proof today from Donna Gary. I really want to commend her on her testimony. About two weeks ago we spoke about the possibility of my reviewing her draft testimony, since I am used to the way Washington operates and she isn't. I'm just very grateful that I didn't do that. I never saw her testimony or heard her testimony before today. I think her testimony could not be improved. More-over, it sets forth several cases of failure to observe containdica-tions.Unfortunately, as I told you, we get lots of letters from parents whose children have been injured or even killed by the pertussis vaccine. These letters indicate and a number of court cases con- firm, that there have been and continue to be, numerous cases of malpractice resulting from failure to observe the contraindicationsagainst administering pertussis vaccine.With the Senator's permission, instead of going over the terrible details, I will simply submit for the record a letter which we sub mitted to the Academy of Pediatrics on December 5, 1983, docu- menting three court cases, decided cases or settled cases, and four letters, because we didn't want to overwhelm the AAP we could have sent many, manymore than thatdocumenting instances inwhich contraindications that everybody agrees on were violated. We asked the Academy of Pediatrics to please notify their mem- bers, take the leadership in getting the message out that these con- traindications must be observed; otherwise, potentially catastrophicresults can occur. We would like to make this part of the record.Senator HAWKINS. StP.ely.[The letters referred to follow:] or.

Thank you.Senator HAWKINS. I believe you were here at previous hearingswhen vice heard testimony from the administration, as well as thePediatrics Association, that they were now. printing a warning anddistributing that warning, signs to look for, and giving it to theparents prior to having the child inoculated. Obviously, that is notworking universally.Mr. SCHWARTZ. No, Senator Hawkins, it is not. The letters we re-ceive continue to say, \"Our doctor never told us that there was anyrisk.\" Even the stories at the public health clinics, where supposed-ly authorities are to distribute these totally inadequate informationforms, parents sometimes don't get them. They are rushed into thething. They don't get a chance to read them. They have no opportu-nity to discuss the information. Their children aren't even givenexams of their ears and throats in many cases, I m an a simplephysical exam to ascertain whether they are currentl ill. This system really can be mar'e a lot safer just wit the existing vaccine if we honor the contraindications that are there, if we ex-amine our children, if we ask some questions. These simple safe-guards have been and continue to be ignored all too frequently andeverything has been assumed to be fine.Senator HAWKINS. Could you discuss the vaccine injury table inS. 2117?Mr. SCHWARTZ. Yes, Senator Hawkins. The vaccine injury tableis a concept that either HHS has misunderstood or deliberately dis-torted. Now I know that they have high quality lawyers there andthey are able to read legislation. So that raises an interesting ques-tion.It is very clear that the vaccine injury table creates a presump-tion. If a parent can demonstratethe parent has the burden ofproofthat a child fits into the conditions Jf the vaccine injurytable, then they would be entitled to compensation unless, by a pre-ponderance of the evidence, the record demonstrates that there isanother better explanation for the child's illness or disability.When HHS says \"incontrovertible evidence\" would be requiredto show an alternative causation once a child fits within the condi-tions of the table, that is simply wrong. That is not what the billsays. I don't know where they got that. but that is not what the billsays. If they would read page 20 of the bill, they would see whatthe standard is in order to disprove a vaccine relationshipAlso, if they want to know where we got this, the Academy ofPediatrics came up with the idea for a vaccine injury table initial-ly We met with them, and we said we like the concept of a pe-sumptive table, so parents will know if they if their children willbe eligible for compensation or not. We has some problems withthe table that the AAP had initially devised because we didn'tthink it correctly refleict the medical literature. So we looked at theNational Childhood Ehcephalopathy Study in England. I commenditto the Health and Human Services Department because theycommended it to us. If they would read it again, they would findthat. it shows that statistically significant excess levels of convul-sions with long-term consequences are occurring up to a week afterthe DPI' immunization. That is what the study says.123 119Their own study, the UCLA study, funded by the FDA, shows a strong correlation with these kinds of reactions. Of course, the UCLA study didn't look at reactions occurring more than 48 hours after vaccination.So when HHS says, \"We don't know where we got this table,\" we got them from the. places that HHS told us to consider. In fact, we got a lot of the data from an HHS report from the National Center for Health Statistics,, called \"Estimated Cost of Selected Medical Events Known or Suspected to be Related to the Administration of Common Vaccines,\" April 1981. This is an HHS report. Why were they doing studies on the cost of compensation for events which don't occur?Senator HAWKINS. Good question.Mr. SCHWARTZ. Why haven't they read their own report? We didn't make this up out of thin air.There would be no compensation if a child has not suffered per- manent damage lasting longer than a year or hospital expenses of at least $2,500. That would have to be a pretty significant event, in light of what is found in the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study and their own study, the UCLA studynamely, a lot of par- ents don't even hospitalize their kids or bring their kids to a doctor when the children havea seizure. The parents may not even knowwhat a seizure is because the doctors haven't informed them of what subtle neurological signs mean. So we are talking here of compensation only for pretty major events.. HHS poses a worst-case notion here. I mean, they really createa strawman in their testimony when they say, if all these children could come in, they could all get scads of money, lawyers' fees could added up, children could all get compensation for pain and suffering, and that is whywe shouldn't pass the bill.Well, if they would look at the safeguards of the bill, I think the safeguards are there toprevent the Treasury be looted. I thinktheir real fear is that they know the truth. In their hearts they know the truththereare many hundreds of children out therewho will be entitled to compensation because they have been se- ..verely injured by these vaccines, and HHS doesn't want to admitSenator Hawkins, if you will bear with me, I just want to read to you something from Science magazine that goes to the issue of fillS's willingness to admit the truth.The article from Sciencesays:Federal responsibility for the development of new vaccines is notably imprecise. Besides diffuseness of responsibility, the picture is also blurred by reluctance among vaccine workers to discuss problems openly when they arise. This is because of the understandable fear that public confidence in vaccines and vaccine authorities will be erodedNone of this implies that faults have been covered up or that the public has been conspired against in some kind of way but there are dangers that problems will be do-emphasized in any system that discourages the fullest possible discussions, as some believe has been the caseFor instance. a recent article on -Reactions with Viral Vaccines- says. \"There has been a tendency on the part of certain higher government circles to play down an open discussion of problems associated with vaccines Perhaps this has been overdone Scientists now find themselves in the position of balancing benefits of a %accine against the risk. yet are in no position to judge what the long-term risks are124. 120Then the article goes on to say thatThe agency is failing in improving the quality of vaccines and assessing thelonger-term risks and benefits associated with vaccine use.It says:There has been curious inertia in seeking out or pursuing research data with im-plications for a regulatory decision. Specific research areas in which the coverage ismoat commonly faulted are the improvement of existing vaccines, particularly,among others, pertussis.Now the thing that is most upsetting about this article in Sci-ence, Senator Hawkins, is that it was written in 1972. We are in1984. Will we be here again, reading that we need a safer pertuasisvaccine in 1996?Senator HAWKINS. Not if it's up to me.I have three cosponsors for this bill. Senator Hatch bravely co-sponsored it, Senator Slade Gorton from Washington, and SenatorMatsunagaso that is 3 of all of the 100 Senators. A lot of themare waiting for the outcome, they tell me, of this hearing today, be-cause there is some concern that, if we have compensation, weshould not allow the parents to sue, also. They want that removed.If this bill were enacted, in your opinion, Jeff, do you think someparents might switch to the compensation bill in lieu of the tortsuit?Mr. SCHWARTZ. I truly believe, Senator Hawkins, that therewould be a number of parents who, if given the option, wouldchoose to go the route of the compensation option. Parents whohave children who are severely handivpped don't need the hassleof a lawsuit too. They don't need all the pain and delays and ex-pense, et cetera. All that parents want to do is protect their kids. Ifthey had a reasonably sure, reasonably simple, reasonably equita-ble, and reasonably inexpensive,way to get compensation for theirchildren, I think lots of parents would choose that, even thoughthey might get less under that system than they might under thetort system. But parents will insist on their right to choose what isbest for their children.That is why we support the bill, even though it does not author-ize punitive damages under the compensation system, even thoughit authorizes no pain and suffering for the parents, because theconcern is for the children. Yes, I think many would switch. Yes, Ithink that would save money. Yes, I think that would in the longrun be more just. But, again, the option to sue must be preserved.Senator HAWKINS. Thank you.You indicated in previous testimony before the committee thatyou had some correspondence written, answers to some questionsthat you submitted to HHS. I wonder if you could submit them forthis record.Mr. SCHWARTZ. We would be pleased to do so.Senator HAWKINS.

It should be noted at the time of licensure of these DTP vaccines, some manufacturers obtained a license foreach individual component of a combined vaccine, prior to filing a license 128 124 application for the combined product. Therefore, we have enclosed a copy ofthe appropriate component's approval documentation to supplement the .manufacturer's initial license approval for DTP. (b)PLEASE SUBMIT ALL ADVERSE REACTION DATA SUBMITTED BY THE VACCINEMANUFACTURER (WHICH WAS REQUESTED TO PROVIDE SUCH OATA BY THEFDA) IN RESPONSE TO THE FINAL REPORT OF THE PANEL ON REVIEW OFBACTERIAL VACCINES AND TOXOIDS (AUG. 1979).Attachment 8 responds to this request. 4.(a)PLEASE PROVIDE ALL INFORMATION WHICH TENDS TO SHOW WHETHER THEELI LILLY COMPANY'S TRISOLGEN PRODUCT WAS MOREREACTOGENIC/NEUROTOYIC, LESS REACTOGENIC/NEUROTOXIC, OR ABOUTTHE SAME AS WHOLE Cat PERTUSSIS-CONTAINING VACCINES.Trisolgen is the trade name of a DTP adsorbed vaccine manufactured by EliLilly.The pertussis component of this product is an extracted, rather than awhole-cell, antigen. This vaccine was distributed from the early 1960's untilthe mid 1970's, at which time Eli Lilly ceased the manufacture of mostbiologics.There are few published studies of which we are aware in whichthis vaccine was compared to whole cell vaccines. In the report of Weihl ctal., (Am. J. Dis. of Children 106: 124, 1963) there are data which indicatethat children who received the extracted vaccine (Trisolgen) had fewer febrilereactions (defined by these investigators, as febrile responses greater than0.5 degrees above normal) and fewer local reactions at the site of injectionthan did children given any of four different whole-cell vaccines. Seriousneurological reactions were not described.This product was reviewed by the Panel on Review of Bacterial Vaccines andToxoids (see Final Report, Volume 1. August 1979, pp. 293-297). In theirreport, they state \"in the matter of safety, the data give the generalimpression that the vaccine containing extracted pertussis antigen is somewhatless reactive than whole-cell pertussis vaccine in terms of local and minorsystemic reactions. There is not sufficient basis to assume that this vaccineis any more or less safe than whole-cell vaccines in terms of the very lowrisk of serious encephalopathic reactions which accompanies the use ofpertussis vaccines.\" (b)PLEASE PROVIDE ALL INFORMATION ON THEREACTOGENICITY/NEUROTOXICITv OF THE WYETH LABORATORIES'EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCT USING THE LILLY PRODUCTION-EXTRACTIONMETHOD OBTAINED IN THE CLINICAL TRIALS OR OTHER STUDIES OF THISPRODUCT.Recently, experimental extract vaccines, simulating this type of acellularpertussis vaccine, were manufactured by Wyeth Laboratories. Clinical studiesfrom two centers comparing two types of the DTP products containing whole cellvaccines were described by Brunell at a workshop on new pertussis vaccines(Brunei! 1982) (Attachment 9). Data from one of these centers in 105 129 125 children were recently published by Murphy et al. (1983). The authors describe four \"notable\" reactions. Two children who received extract vaccinesexperienced episodes of irritability and screaming following the firstimmunization.These children were given subsequent injections and werereported to be developing normally one year after immunization. A third childreceiving an extract vaccine had a temperature of 40\u00b0C (1040 F) after the third injection. One child given whole-cell vaccine also experienced atemperature of 40\u00b0C and was found to have otitis media when examined the dayafter immunization. These workers reported that no child had a convulsion or shock-like episode. The results of studies with this vaccine performed at thesecond center and also presented at the workshop have not yet been qublished.These clinical trials have not demonstrated that the extracted vaccineproducts are clearly superio- to the existing whole-cell vaccines. (c)IN THE RONNEBFRGER AND ZWISLER ARTICLE REFERRED TO BELOW(QUESTION 7a), THE AUTHORS STATE, \"DPT-VACCINES WITH WHOLEBACTERIA AS THE ANTIGEN PRODUCED ENCEPHALOMYELITIS IN E7.9% OFTHE LEWIS RATS AND 37.0% OF THE WISTAR RATS. AFTER INOCULATIONOF EXTRACTED PERTUSSIS ANTIGENS, ONLY 16.4% OF LEWIS RATS AND5.7% OF WISTAR RATS SHOWED NEUROTOXIC REACTIONS.\" (P. 182) THISSEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT EXTRACTED PERTUSSIS VACCINES CAN BE LESSNEUROTOXIC TO MAN THAN WHOLE CELL VACCINES. IN LIGHT OF THISINFORMATION, PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY YOU THINK THE WYETH EXPERIMENTALPRODUCT CLINICAL TRIAL DATA DID NOT DEMONSTRATE THAT THISEXTRACTED VACCINE WAS \"SUPERIOR TO THE EXISTING WHOLE CELLVACCINE\" FROM TEW STANDPOINT OF POTENTIALREACTOGENICITY/NEUROTOXICITY (ACCORDING TO DR. BRANDT'S JULY 21,1982, LETTER TO REP. DAN MICA, QUESTION 15)?Ronneberger and Zwisler reported on the ability of pertussis vaccines toenhance the antigenicity of guinea pig spinal cord, a foreign central nervous system (CNS) tissue, when injected into rats. Reaction against the injectedCNS tissue resulted in an experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Thisway of inducing CNS disease experimentally is not a new idea. Use ofadjuvants along with neural tissues from a foreign species has been commonlyused for many years to study EAE. The Ronneberger and Zwisler article did notdeal with direct toxicity of a component of pertussis vaccine on the CNS. TfilEAE enhancing activity may or may not be related to other biological activitysuch as potential neurotoxicity. The reduced rate of late weight gain in themouse weight gain test is the laboratory procedure which correlates with theclinical reactogenicity of pertussis vaccine [for further discussion, see response to question 5(a)]. In the discussion of their publication,Ronneberger and Zwisler state that \"The recommended bioassay showed goodcorrelation with the common toxicity tests performed with pertussis vaccines,such as the mouse weight gain test or the leukocytosis tests, and the increaseof histamine sensitivity of mice.\" It is not clear that the procedure theyhave used has any advantage over the types of tests currently used world widefor this purpose. In addition, we should also note that the extractionprocedure used by lonneberger and Zwisler was not described in their articleand it is therefore difficult to make a meaningful comparison between theirextract vaccine and that produced by Wyeth. 1. 30 38-4`,4 ()-ii4- 9 126 Finally, as stated in our answer to question 4(b) above, the availableclinical data do not support the suggestion that the Wyeth experimentalpertussis vaccine was less reactogenic/neurotoxic than whole cell vaccine.. (d)HAS FDA DONE (OR IS FDA AWARE OF) ANY COMPARATIVE RISK-BENEFITANALYSIS OF WHOLE CELL PERTUSSIS VACCINES AGAINST EXTRACTEDVACCINES?(IF NOT, WHY NOT? IS SUCH A .COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENTPLANNED?IF SO, WHAT DID THE ASSESSMENT SHOW?) See response to questions 4(a) and 4(b) above. 5.IN DR. PETRICCIANI'S NOVEMBER 17, 1982, LETTER TO BARBARA FISHER, VICEPRESIDENT OF DISSATISFIED PARENTS TOGETHER, THE STATEMENT IS MADE THAT,\"THERE IS NO LABORATORY PROCEDURE WHICH IS ABLE TO EVALUATE A VACCINE'STENDENCY TO PRODUCE ABNORMALLY HIGH FEVER, CONVULSIONS, COLLAPSE,EXCESSIVE SCREAMING OR POSSIBLE BRAIN DAMAGE.\" (PAGE 4) a.PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW THIS STATEMENT CAN BE RECONCILED WITH (i) THEEXISTENCE OF THE PROPOSED ANIMAL ASSAY PROCEDURE RECOMMENDED FORPRECLINICAL TESTING OF PERTUSSIS RATS--TOXICITY 4, 179-183 (1980); (ii) THEEXISTENCEWrPA'S NEURbTOXICITY GUIDELINES UNDERSECTION 4 OF THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT; (iii) THE ANIMALTESTING MODEL/PROCEDURES USED BY STEINMAN, ET.

FISHER, ARE REQUIRED BY THEJAPANESE GOVERNMENT: AND (v) THE NUMEROUS ANIMAL STUDIES OFFEBRILE SEIZURES, ETC. REFERENCED IN NELSON AND ELLENBERG,FEBRILE SEIZURES, NEW YORK: RAVEN PRESS (1981). Th,statement was made because we are still unaware of any tests which arecapable of predicting the ability of a vaccine to produce abnormally highfever, convulsions, collapse, excessive screaming, or possible brain damage.any investigators have tried to define the components of vaccines which mightbe involved in eliciting such effects. It is known that the vaccine maycontain a variety of biologically active substances, such as endotoxin (as doother vaccines derived from gram negative bacteria) and LPF.A variety ofprocedures have been utilized in Many laboratories in an attempt to evaluatethe \"toxicity\" of pertussis vaccines. Several of these tests were used in arecent report by Hooker (J. Biol. Stand. 9: 493-506, 1981). She concludedthat based on her evaluation the \"seven day weight gain test and thehyperinsulinemia test appeared to be the most sensitive to differences betweenvaccines.\"As you know, a mouse weight gain test has beer used for measuringthe \"toxicity\" of vaccines in some laboratories for many years. This type of 131 127 assay isin usein the U.S.Some workers have shown that vaccines woich aremore reactive in this assay are associated with more reactions in children,but others have found no such relationship (reviewed by Hooker). This assayis often considered to be measuring the mixtures of toxic materials which maybe produced by B. pertussis, including endotoxin and LPF, and it is assays ofthis type that are usenVoughout the world by biologics control agencies. (i).The paper by Ronneberger and Zwisler (1980), as stated in ourresponse to question 4(c), extends the observations previously made by manyworkers to show that pertussis vaccines when injected along with foreiceicentral nervous system tissue, such as spinal cord, elicit an allergiencephalomyeliti!. (EAE). As indicated above, these workers have reported thatwhen the neurotoxic activity, as defined by EAE, was compared to the toxicityof a vaccine as evaluated by a mouse weight gain or histamine sensitizing,assay, good correlation between tests was obtained. Although this type ofassay has been proposed as a tool for assessing the toxicity of per1wAlsvaccines, we are unaware that any data are available to correlate the resultsof such a bioassay with the ability to predict the ability of a vaccine tcinduce neurologic reactions in infan's. The correlation of such an assay withneurological events considered to be rare in number would be very difficult toestablish.The CPA neurotoxicity testing guidelines relate to techniques fordeveloping data on morphologic changes in the nervous system for chemicalsubstances and mixtures subject to such testing under the Toxic SubstanceControl Act (TOSCA). The types of tests included in these guidelines werespecifically tailored to the assessment of toxic substances defined in the Actand are not directly transferable for the purpose of testing pertussisvaccines for their \". ..tendency to produce abnormally high fever,convulsions, collapse, excessive screaming or possible brain damage\".On the other hand, recent research with biological toxins has utilized morespecific and sensitive studies at the cellular, subcellular, and molecularlevels.Such studies may permit a better understanding of the physical andchemical nature of a toxin, its interaction and effect on host target tissuesand eventually may allow the design of specific tests for such toxins.However, it would be necessary to show that such tests correlate with clinicalreactions before they would be considered for routine use in control testingof pertussis vaccines. (iii).The paper by Steinman et al is of course of great interest. However,as indicated in our comments above, we are not aware that any cbrrelation hasyet been made between the observations, and the ability of a vaccine to inducesevere reactions in children. These authors suggest that their model mayprc.ide insight into the pathogenesis of immunization-induced neurologicalcorrplications. We will be following this work with great interest. However,it should be pointed out that the most effective method for solving theproblem of serious adverse reactions probably lies in the development ofimproved vaccines. (See also our response to Question 5(b) below). 132 128 (iv).As discussed above, many different laboratory assays have beenproposed for evaluating toxicity of vaccines, and different controllaboratories in different countries may use different procedures.WHO hasrecopized (see Requirements for Pertussis Vaccine, Thirtieth Report WHOExpert Committee on Biological Standardization. A.3.4.5. Toxicity Test.1979) that no single test has been developed which can predict untowardreactions.The mouse weight gain test is a procedure that assesses the overall effects ofendotoxin, LPF, and dermonecrotic toxin. The Japanese government does requireother assays for pertussis vaccines which are not required in theUnited States and we are not aware these are a routine requirement of anyother national control authorities testing of pertussis vaccine.Thoseadditional tests done in Japan include a test for mouse-leukocyte increasingtoxicity and a test for dermonecrotic (heat labile) toxin. At the time aproduct license is approved in the United States, evidence is presented toshow that the method for inactivation employed by the manufacturer inactivatesthe dermonecrotic 'axin of pertussis vaccine. Pertussis vaccines marketedunder U.S. license do not contain biologicallyactive dermonecrotic toxin endthis is checked by the absence of early deaths in the mouse weight gain testsdone on each vaccine lot. The mouse leucocyte-increasing toxicity test doneby the Japanese measures the biological activity of LPF. This activity ismeasured by the reduced rate of late weight gain in the mouse weight gaintest. (v).The experimental systems described in Febrile Seizures relate to theartificial induction of hyperthermia in animals, and the assessment ofsubsequent seizures and pathologicalllesions. We are not aware of informationto suggest that if pertussis vaccines were used in those or other animaltests, that any of themtould predict the ability of a vaccine to produceabnormally high fever and seizures in humans. As pointed out by Dr. Vannucciin Febrile Seizures,\"In addition, it is clear that what we do by inducingseizures with fever in animals is vastly different from thesituation in human beings, simply because many childrenmanifest their seizures with fever at temperatures muchlower than those at which we are able to obtain seizuresanimals.Even in the youngest and most susceptibleanimals, one must induce temperatures well above those seenin the clinical setting.\"Unfortunately, animals do not usually show us a gradedrange of biological variation in response to differentlevels of heat. Each species and age seems to developseizures at a specific level of temperature. Further,seizure - susceptible, inbred strains are vulnerable only tospecific stimuli: audiogenic, seizure-susceptible animalsdo not have seizures easily with fever.So as yet, we donot have a good experimental model of febrile seizures inthe animal situation.\" 133 129 The use of limited resources for the development and clinical testing ofimproved vaccines would seem to be a more productive approach than to divert those resources into research on an animal model for febrile seizures. However, if a test is developed for febrile seizures which does provide goodcorrelations with the human clinical situation, it would be evaluated with respect to its usefulness in testing current or new pertussis vaccines (b)WHAT RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, OR OTHER STUDIES ARE CURRENTLY BEINGCONDUCTED BY, SUPPORTED BY, OR PLANNED BY HHS (FDA?, CDC? NIH?OTHER?) TO DEVELOP AN ANIMAL TEST PROCEDURE WHICH CAN BE USEDEFFECTIVELY AS A PRELINICAL SCREENING MECHANISM TO DETECTVACCINE LOTS WHICH TEND TO BE MORE NEUROTOXIC/POTENTIALLYREACTOGENIC?The agency uses animal models such as lymphocytosis in mice and histamine sensitization in its evaluation of purified antigens and in its experimentalprograms of evaluation of LPF antigen content of vaccines (see transcript of Workshop 1982). These assays are being used to evaluate the bioactivity ofantigens which might be considered protective antigens.The work of Steinman et al., was supported in part by an NIH grant (NS 18235-01).Researchers from England have begun studies of children who develop complications from pertussis vaccine. They hope to identify a genetic marker in humans which may help to identify a subpopulation of children whoare atigreater risk to reactions to the vaccine. The feasibility ofconducting retrospective or prospective HLA studies in humans in the United States is under review by NIAID. (c)WHAT CURRENT PLANS DOES HHS HAVE TO REQUIRE LICENSEDMANUFACTURERS TO UTILIZE ONE OR MORE LABORATORY TEST PROCEDURESFOR EVALUATING A PERTUSSIS VACCINE'S POTENTIALNEUROTOXICITY/REACTOGENICITY (OTHER THAN THE MOUSE WEIGHT GAINPROCEDURE WHICH ADMITTEDLY IS INADEQUATE FOR THE ABOVEPURPOSE)?WHAT CURRENT PLANS DOES HHS HAVE TO CONDUCT SUCHTESTING ITSELF?See comments under (a)(iv) above. At the present time, HHS has no plans torequire licensed manufacturers to include additional tests for licensed whole cell vaccines. As new scientific information is developed, FDA would consider performingadditional ast:tys on licensed products, and if there were a consensus thatthey were meaningful, they would be proposed as new requirements.6.IN DR. PETRICCIANI\"S LETTER TO MS. FISHER REFERRED TO ABOVE, THE ANSWER TO QUESTION 21 WAS AS FOLLOWS: TITLE 21 OF THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS,SECTION 211.198 REQUIRES THAT MANUFACTURERS HAVE WRITTEN PROCEDURESDESCRIBING THE HANDLING OF WRITTEN AND ORAL COMPLAINTS.BOTH THE 08 AND THE CLNTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL RECEIVE REPORTS OF ADVERSE REACTIONS.THE NATURE OF THEIR RESPONSE IS BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF THE REPORTED REACTIONS.\" 134 k 130 (a)PLEASE PROVIDE A COPY OF EACH OF THE WRITTEN PROCEDURES ADOPTEDBY WYETH, LEDERLE, AND CONNAUGHT IN CONFORMANCE WITH 21 CFR211.198.The provisions of 21 CFR 211.198 are part of the Good Manufacturing Practicesfor Human and Veterinary Drugs with which manufacturers of licensed biologicalproducts must comply. It was the intent of the agency when these regulationswere promulgated to provide manufacturers with as much latitude as possiblefor efficient review of the drug product complaints. Thus, the manufacturersare responsible for the development of their own internal written standardoperating.procedures in conformance with the requirements of 21 CFR 211.198.Manufacturers are not required to submit copies of their written proceduresfor handling oral and written complaints. (b)WERE THESE PROCEDURES REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY FDA? (IF SO,WHEN?IF NOT, WHY NOT?);The written procedures are reviewed as part of the FDA inspection of licensedmanufacturers. Inspectors examine the procedures for adequacy in terms ofcompleteness, timeliness and follow-up action on all oral and writtencomplaints received. Any significant deficiencies are brought to theattention of the responsible head of the establishment. (c)WHAT SYSTEMS, TECHNIQUES, OR APPROACHES DOES FDA USE TO ASSURETHAT THE COPANY'S PROCEDURES FOR RESPONDING TO COMPLAINTS ANDADVERSE REACTION REPORTS ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED AS WRITTEN?As indicated in accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations,section 211.198, the manufacturer must establish and follow written proceduresdescribing the handling of all written and oral complaints regarding a drugproduct.A written record of each complaint is maintained in a filedesignated for drug product complaint. The file should include the followinginformation, where known: the name and strength of the product; lot number;name of complainant; nature of complaint; and reply to complainant. When aninvestigation of the product records is conducted, the written record shouldinclude the findings of the investigation and follow-up. When aninvestigation of the production records is not conducted, the written recordshould include the reason that an investigation was found not to be necessaryand the name of the responsible person making the determination. Themanufacturers are inspected on a routine basis and the complaint files arerequired to be readily available for inspection. The inspector can observethe implementation of the manufacturer's written procedures for handlingcomplaints. (d)IS TPE FDA AWARE OF ANY INFORMATION THAT THESE PROCEDURES AREt.OT BE:NG/OR HAVE NOT BEEN FOLLOtiED IN ANY CASE? IF SG, PLEASEPROVIDE THAT INFORMATION?An extensive search of the inspection files for each biologic productmanufacturer would be necessary to determine whether or not firms were everfound to be deficient in a particular area of the regulations. 135 131 A search of the inspection files for the last 5 years (1978=present) for thethree companies listed in question 6(a) failed to reveal any reporteddeficiencies in the manner in which they handle complaints. (e)IS THE FDA CONSIDERING EITHER REVISING SECTION 211.198 TOREQUIRE MORE EXTENSIVE FOLLOW-UP BY MANUFACTURERS IN CASESINVOLVING REPORTS OF ANY OF THE REACTIONS LISTED IN QUESTION 1(ABOVE) OR REQUIRING REVISION OF THE WRITTEN PROCEDURES WITHOUTANY CHANGE IN THE REGULATIONS TO ASSURE MANUFACTURER TRACKINGAND RECORDKEEPING OF SIGNIFICANT POST-REACTION SEQUELLAE?At this time, FDA is not planning to revise section 211.198, nor are weconsidering requiring revisions without a change in the regulations. 7.IS THE HHS DEPARTMENT CONSIDERING ATTEMPTING TO DEFINE CATEGORIES OFPOTENTIALLY HIGH RISK CHILDREN (I.E., POTENTIALLY AT HIGHER RISK OFSIGNIFICANT ADVERSE REACTION TO PERTUSSIS VACCINATION THAN CHILORtI IN THENORMAL POPULATION) FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ANDGUIDANCE TO PHYSICIANS, STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, PUBLIC HEALTHCLINICS, ETC.?. .. HHSis interested in identifying factors which might predict significantadverse reactions to pertussis vaccination. As indicated in Section 3 of thereport to Senat5 Hawkins, we are currently reviewing policies andrecommendations rom other countries and consulting the medical literaturewith regard to current contra-indications. Individual reaction reoorts in HHSor manufacturer files have been considered in determining contraindications inthe past; use of this source of information will be continued. TheMSIFIsystem in particular is just now getting systematized. Such reports will be apart of further considerations. Followup of all reports of neurologicalevents reported following vaccination will provide additional informationabout pre-existing conditions which is not present on the current reportforms.We would be pleased to receive reports of reactions discovered inletters from parents and include these in the considerations. TheDepartment's approach to arriving at definitions of contraindications andprecautions is through consultation with a variety of groups, including butnot limited to the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)and FDA'sVaccine Advisory Committee. Meetings of these committees are open to thepublic and announced in the Federal Register. The basis for the currentrecommendations of the Department of Health and Social Security, UnitedKingdom, and those of the ACIP and the AAP are under review by CDC. Theresults of this review are to be presented to the ACIP at its meeting onOctober 18-19, 1983. 9.IN DR. BRANDT\"S LETTER TO REP. MICA (REFERRED TO ABOVE), THE FOLLOWINGQUESTION AND ANSWER WAS INCLUDED:\"SHOULD PARENTS HAVE A CHOICE AS TO WHETHER TO GIVE THE [PERTUSSIS] SHOT?\"WE URGE THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS DISCUSS THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF ALLVACCINATIONS WITH PARENTS.\" 136 132 (a)SPECIFICALLY, WHAT STEPS HAS HHS TAKEN TO \"URGE\" HEALTH CAREPROVIDERS TO DISCUSS RISKS AND BENEFITS OF PERTUSSIS VACCINATIONWITH PARENTS?DOES THE DEPARTMENT HAVE ANY EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE,STUDIES, OR OTHER PROOF THAT THESE STEPS TO URGE DOCTOR-PARENTDISCUSSION OF RISKS AND BENEFITS PRIOR TO VACCINATION IS WORKINGIN FACT, I.E., THAT. HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE ENGAGING INDETAILED DISCUSSIONS OF VACCINE RISKS AND BENEFITS WITH PARENTSBEFORE CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATIONS?HHS sponsored a survey of public attituoes and practices towards immunizationsin 1979.This indicated that, of families in which children had received DTPvaccination in the preceding 12 months, 43 percent had had informationpresented to them about risks and benefits and 33 percent had signed a form.This survey also indicated that 3 percent of children who had received DTPinthe past year had a reaction that required a visit to a doctor, hospital, orclinic.HHS through its publications and preseAtations, and recommendations of theACIP, urges all nealtn-care providers to discuss risks and benefits of allvaccinations with the recipients or their parents. The \"GeneralRecommendations on Immunization\" of the ACIP state: \"Parents and patientsshould be informed about the benefits and risks of vaccines. It is essentialthat the patient or the responsible person Le given information concerning therisks of vaccines as well as the major benefits from vaccines in preventingdisease in both individuals and the community.

PLEASE STATE WHETHER OR NOT HHS FAVORS OR OPPOSES STATE LAWS WHICHAUTHORIZE AN EXEMPTION FROM MANDATORY VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE or\"Pli110e,OPHICAL OBJECTION\" OR \"PERSONAL CONVICTION\"?

The model schoolimmu_ization law drafted by the Centers for Disease Control and distributed inFebruary MI ;.rov!.!ed for religious and medical exemptions but not forpersonal or philosophical exemptions. Religious exemptions have beentradit;undl part et iwrunization requirements. However, courts in at :easttho States (Arkansas, Nryland) have struck down religious exemptions inreceht :fears.An important reason for not vigorously suppert;ng0,rsonal'pvilosophical exemptions h,a5 heen a feeling that it is likely ran,parents wGulA choose to claim such exemptions rather than go to the trouble oflocatint; imiewitation records ur LID THE DISEASE IN,REASY 13S 134 Data are not available which would permit analysis of incidence of pertussisbefore and after adoption of personal/philosophical exemptions from mandatoryimmunization.It should be noted that States which allowpersonal/Oilosophical exemptions do so generically, rather than for anyspecific immunization alone. (a)IS THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE GI: A PER CAPITA BASIS IN THEWHOOPING COUGH INCIDENCE RATE (REPORTa AND CONFIRMED) BETWEENSTATES WHICH PERMIT SUCH EXEMPTIONS AND STATES WHICH DO NOT?There are six States which do not require pertussis immunization for schoolentrance (Arizona, Kentucky, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island).In 1982 the provisional pertussis incidence rate in those States was 1.394cases per 100,000. Sixteen States which require pertussis vaccination allowpersonal or philosophical exemptions for immunizations (California, Colorado,Delaware, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota,Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin). The provisionalpertussis rate in those States in 1982 was 0.63 cases per 100,000. Theremainder of States require pertussis immunization arid do not permitpersonal/philosophical exemptions. The proiisional pertussis rater. in thoseStates is 0.66. The difference in incidence tee between States which do notregre pertussis at all and those which do is significant. There is nosignificant difference in the reported pertussis incidence rate in Stateswhich require pertussis immunization and allow personal/philosophicalexemptions as compared with those which require pertussis immunization and donot allow such exemptions. (b)ON A STATE-BY-STATE BASIS, HOW MANY EXEMPTIONS HAVE BEENREQUESTED ON THE \"PERSONAL CONVICTION\" OR \"PHILOSOPHICOCJECTION\" GROUNDS SINCE 1970?Nta are not available to permit a response to this question since thisinformation is not systematically reported to CDC. However, data from theStates which do report such information to CDC indicate that less than 1percent of students have personal or philosophical exemptions.

Development, Production and Usage 140 1364 8.IN DR. BRANDT'S LETTER TO REPRESENTATIVE MICA (REFERRED TO ABOVE), THEFOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWER WAS INCLUDED:\"20. DO YOU THINK THAT REACTIONS TO PERTUSSIS VACCINE SHOULD BE AMANDATORY REPORTING ELEMENT FOR DOCTORS?\" ' \"WE BELIEVE THAT SEVERE OR UNEXPECTED REACTIONS TO ANY VACCINE SHOULD BEREPORTED BY PHYSICIANS. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT EVEN IF MANDATED, THIS COULD,SATISFACTORILY BE IMPLEMENTED.\" (a)DOES FDA/HHS/CDC HAVE THE AUTHORITY EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLYUNDER EXISTING LEGISLATION TO MANDATE SUCH REPORTING BY PRIVATEPHYSICIANS? IF NOT, WOULD FDA/HHS FAVOR LEGISLATION TO CONFER UPON ITSUCH AUTHORITY OR TO DIRECTLY REQUIRE SUCH REPORTING? (IF NOT, WHYNOT?)The types of recordkeeping and adverse reaction reporting requirements thatyou have inquired about are the type of requirements that would normally be*.aposed under the current good manufacturing practices (CGMP's) provisions ofthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\"FDC Act\"). Biological products aredrugs and as such are required to be manufactured in accordance with CGMP's.However, the CGMP requirements do not apply co the practice of medicine. We,an and do impose these types of recordkeeping requirements on manufacturers,processors, and packers of drug products, but do not have authority to imposesimilar requirements on physicianA. Nor would it appear that other provisionsof the FDC Act or the Public Health 'Service Act would provide such authority. :n regard to the second part of your question, FDA /NHS believes that requiringmandatory reporting of adverse reactions by physicians would be a significantlditional burden, would be difficult to enforce, and thus would be regardedas controversial. In view of the current efforts to address the problem ofaverse reaction reporting alluded to elsewhere in our response, we believethatit would be premature to foster such legislation without further carefuldeliberation and discussion of the matter with outside advisory groups. Itshould also be noted that such a requirement would likely incur significantcosts for providing for the review of this additional information and forenforcement.\"0-,t current redortrw., systews concern( with the occurrence of diseases or ofa:ver, reactions are voluntary.

SUBSEQUENT SALES OF EHE 141 137 VACCINE?IF SO, IS FDA CONSIDERING IMPLEMENTING THIS AUTHORITY?(IF NOT, WHY NOT?) IF FDA /HITS /CDC DOES NOT HAVE THE ABOVE AUTHORITYUNDER EXISTING LAW, WOULD FDA /NHS /CDC FAVOR LEGISLATION TO CONFERUPON IT SUCH AUTHORITY?As noted above, FDA does not have authority to directly require physicians toreport adverse reactions. It is therefore doubtful that FDA could doindirectly, i.e., by requiring manufacturers to contractually impose reportingrequirements upon physicians, what it cannot do directly.. Moreover, even ifFDA could require such a contractual provision, enforcement of the provisionwould be very difficult. FDA could not inspect physicians' offices, nor couldFDA take any action against a physician who failed to make Such reports. ASdiscussed above, FDA believes that a voluntary physician-adverse reactionreporting system is appropriate. (c)HOW SHOULD \"SEVERE OR UNEXPECTED\" REACTIONS BE DEFINED FORREPORTING PURPOSES ONLY? 11.1.Severe or unexpected reactions could be defined to include an event which iseither: 1.not reported in the for treatment; and/or 6.takes longer than 15 days for recovery. (d)SAME QUESTIONS AS (a) AND ;1)1 ONLY WITH RESPECT TO THE AUTHORITYTO REQUIRE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY WRITTEN RECORDKEEPING BY THEADMINISTERING PERSON OF THE MANUFACTURER'S NAPE AND LOT NUMBEROF DATE OF ADMINISTRATION FOR EACH VACCINATION CONTAININGPERTUSSIS?FDA probably could not require manufacturers td. make physicians keep records. (e)WOULD HHS/FDA/CDC FAVOR GIVING DIRECT INFORMATION TO PARENTS ONTHEIR RIGHT TO FILE ADVERSE REACTION REPORTS DIRECTLY WITH CDC?WOULD HMS/FDA/CDC FAVOR REQUIRING PHYSICIANS TO NOTIFY PARENTSOF THIS RIGHT IN WRITING. WHY OR WHY NOT? Parents of children gives. DTP, measles-mumps-rubella and poliovirus vaccinesin public programs already receive an \"information form which solicits reportsof reactions occurring within four weeks of immunization to a responsibleindividual.\"This information regarding significant reactions is then rela1cdto CDC.The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases(the \"Redbook\" (.ommittee) has reprinted these forms in their latest Report 142 138 (1982) and has indicated that, \"...practitioners should consider the use ofthese o:similar materials for parents and patients....\" The physician mayreport reactions to either the manufacturer, the USP, or to FDA directly. Although encouraging physicians to notify parents of their rig.t to reportadverse reactions might result in more reported adverse reactions, FDA doesnot have authority to require that they distribute the information. (f)WHAT IS IiHS/FDA/CDC DOING AND PLANNING TO DO TO ENCOURAGEPRIVATE PHYSICIAN REPORTING OF SEVERE ADVERSE REA:TIONS? The FDA encourages private physicians to report severe adverse reactions asfollows: i.A Drug Experience Report Form (FDA 1639) is provided to approximatelyone and one-half million health professionals with the FDA Bulletin, ii.The FDA sponsors an exhibit featuring adverse reaction reporting atvarious health professional meetings. Individuals are encouraged toreport reactions and the procedures for submitting reports areexplained.The majority of reports from individuals are acknowledged by FDA inthe form of a phone call or letter. Reporters are thanked forsubmitting the report and are encouraged to report further reactions. iv.The Drug Experience Report Form is provided in tear-out form in theAMA Crus Evaluations, published by the American Medical Associationin 1903-.PhysiairTi are encouraged to report reactions in thesection on adverse reactions. This form is also includedperiodically in the \"FDA Drug Bulletin\". 9.IN DR. BRANDT'S LETTER TO REPRESENTATIVE MICA (REFERRED TO ABOVE) THEFOLLOWING QUESTION AND ANSWER WAS INCLUDED:\"SHOULD PARENTS HAVE A CHOICE AL TO WHETHER TO GIVE THE (PERTUSSIS) SHOT?\" \"hE URGE THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS DISCUSS THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF ALLVACCINATIONS WITH PARENTS.\" (b)SHOULD VACCINE MANUFACTURERS BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE hRITTtN RISKAND BENEFIT INFORMATION DIRECTLY TO PARENTS PRIOR TOVACCINATION?WHY OR WHY NOT? DOES THE DEPARTMENT HAVE THELEGAL AUTH.ORITY UNDER' EXISTING LAW TO PRESCRIBE AND ENFORCE SUCHA REQUIREMENT?Biol:)gical products, such as vaccines, are drugs and are subject to thelabeling requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDA Act).;ectior 502 (a) of the Fif. Act prohibits false or mIsteading labeling. FDAhas determined that, without a patient package insert, the labels of certainprescription drugs are misleading ti:Kause they fail to reveal facts about theconsequences that may result from the use of the drugs.This position was 143 139 upheld in Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Ass'n v. FDA, 634 F. 2d 106 (3rd Cir.,;1980).Although FDA could require manufacturers tiTprovide to physicians apatient package insert with each dose of vaccine, FDA could not compelphysicians to provide this infdrmation to their patients. The informationprovided to a patient about the risks and benefits of a drug is cons4dered tobe the practice of medicine and is not an area that FDA regulates. (c)SHOULD PERTUSSIS VACLINE MANUFACTURERS BE REQUIRED TO 1 'UDE INITS SALE CONTRACT A PROVISION SUCH AS THAT STATED IN QUL..:ON8(b), EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE PROVISION TO EACH PURCHASER OFTHE VACCINE (INCLUDING THE ULTIMATE USER--THE PARENT OF THEVACCINEE) OF ADEQUATE WRITTEN INFORMATION ON THE BENEFITS ANDRISKS OF THE VACCINE? WHY OR WHY NOT? DOES FDA/HHS HAVE THEAUTHORITY UNDER EXISTING LAW TO IMPOSE SUCH A REQUIREMENT AS ACONDITION OF LICENSURE OR OTHERWISE?See answer to question 8(b). Although FDA does not have authority to mandatesuch a requirement, the committee believes that benefit and risk informationshould be presented to patients and parents. See answer to question 9(a). 12IN DR. BRANDT'S ANSWER TAKE SEVERAL YEARS.\" (a)WrY IS THIS SO? SPECIFICALLY, WHAT STEPS HAVE TO BE TAKEN (ANDWHAT SPECIFIC CRITERIA MET) FOR THIS NEW VACCINE TO QUALIFY FORLICENSURE?The requirements for filing and obtaining approval to market a new vaccine inthis country are the same for all manufacturers. Each manufacturer isrequired to file an establishment license application describing thefacilities used to manufacture the vaccine and a product license describingthe method of production as well as the tests and data to demonstrate thesafety, purity, potency and effectiveness of the product. In addition, eachmanufacturer must develop standardized laboratory tests in order to assurebatch-to-batch consistency and to provide a basis for establishing the datingperiod for the product. (b)HOW LONG APPROXIMATELY SHOULD EACH STEP TAKE?It should be noted that as of this response, no license application for aJapanese or Japanese-type pertussis vaccine has been received by the Office ofBiologics.Until an application has been received and reviewed, it is verydifficult to predict with any accuracy the time required for licensing.However, as an example, the development and initiation of a clinical fieldtrial followed by the review and analysis of the data collected may take twoto three years depending upon the availability of a suitable population tocOnduCt the trials and the criteria (protocol) for establishing the safety andefficacy parameters. ic)ARE THESE REQUIREMENTS AND CRITERIA MORE STRINGENT THAN THELICENSURE REQUIREMENTS AND CRITERIA WHICH HAVE BEEN APPLIED TOTHE WHOLE CELL PERTUSSIS VACCINES NOW IN USE IN THE UNITED 144 140 SIAIL2 'Ai,14 WHAT RESPECTS? ARE THESE REQUIIREMENTS ANL,CRITERIA MORE SikINGENT THAN THOSE APPLIED TO ELI LILLY'STRISOLOGEN PRODUCT? IF SO, IN WHAT RESPECTS?Since the initial licensure of some of the whole cell pertussis vaccines wasover thirty years ago, it is reasonable to expect that the requirements andcriteria for licensure are more stringent today for any new vaccine intendedto be introduced for marketing in the United States. Today we would requiresubstantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine,additional laboratory testing to characterize the vaccine, and greatermanufacturing controls over the production of the vaccine. Since Lilly'sTrisologen/TM was approved for marketing in the 1960's, today's requirementsand criteria would be more stringent as explained.above. (d)IN THE DEPARTMENT'S VIEW IS IT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO APPLYMORE STRINGENT STANDARDS AND TESTS FOn LICENSURE OF NEW VACCINESTHAT HAVE SHOWN THEY CAN MEET STANDARDS AND TESTS WHICH APPLIEDAT THE TIME OF LICENSURE (AND LICENSE REVIEW) OF CURRENTVACCINES, IF SUCH TEST.3 SHOW THE NEW VACCINES TO BESUBSTANTIALLY LESS REACTOGENIC/NEUROTOXIC THAN THE CURRENTLYLICENSED 'ACCJNES?Mary ot t.f.,!standards and tests which would apply to a new pertussis vaccineare already established in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Thedecision on whether or not to license a new pertussis vaccine depends not onlyon its degree of reactogenicity and neurotoxicity, but on other key factorssuch asits efficacy.A new vaccine submitted for licensure might wellremonstrate a very low level of reactogenicity, for example, but fail to beefficacious.We would therfore expect a new pertussis vaccine, as a minimum,to meet the current standards for safety, purity, potency, and efficacy. If,nowever, oata were developed to show that the safety and efficacy standardsalready established in the CFR were not appropriate for a particular newvaccine, FOA would establish a standard for that vaccine.

However, FDA has indicatedits interest in the evaluation of the current Japanese vaccine or aJapanese-like vaccine. Discussions have been held with each of the threemajor manufacturers to encourage them to pursue an acellular pertussisvaccine. In addition, FDA has been in contact with the Japan NationalInstitute of Health (NIH) regarding samples of the Japanese vaccine for bothclinical and labor'atory testing. Because of liability concerns, the Japanesehave restricted our use of any samples which they might supply to us forlaboratory evaluation only. Each of the U.S. commercial manufacturers ofpertussis vaccine has stated that they have ongoing efforts to develop animproved vaccine. In anticipation of the submission of a Japanese-likeacellular vaccine for licensure, as noted above, FDA has done some laboratorytests with samples supplied by the Japan NIH. As a followup, the Japanesehave sent FDA 300 samples from each of five additional lots of pertussisvaccine for laboratory testing; these tests are in progress. FDA is preparedto conduct laboratory testing of experimental lots of new pertussis vaccinecandidates as soon as they are developed.Senator HAWKINS. Mrs. Gary, have you considered litigation?Mrs. GARY. No, that has never been a consideration in ourfamily. We really felt that it was more important tonothing isgoing to bring that babj back. I don't thiuk the doctor was mali-cious in giving the routine shot. I am sorry that he apparently wasso ill-informed, but we really want to do something with ourenergy to change this condition going on as it is.If I may just refer to what you were asking of Jeff as far as theGovernment compensation, the one thing I would be concernedabout personally in thatand since we are not in any kind of liti-gation, maybe I can say it rather objectivelyhow would the man-ufacturers of vaccine and how would the doctors be held accounta-ble if the Government were financially supporting those vaccine-in-jured children? I just would be afraid that perhaps the situationwould continue without the accountability. How would that bebuilt into the bill?Senator H \"imams. What was the cause of death listed on thedeath certificate of your granddaughter?Mrs. GARY. SIDS. Sudden infant death syndrome.I have since talked with a doctor who went over the autopsyreport, and he feels that it should be listed as atypical SIDS and tomake sure that it is listed on there that the DPT inoculation waswithin 4 hours, because that is not on there. It is just SIDS.Senator HAWKINS. Are they going to add the other?Mrs. GARY. I haven't learned how to do that yet. I don't know todo that, and I am in the process of learning how that has to bedone. 18-4'.4 0 - 84 --10146ISP 142SenatorHAWKINS.We will be glad to work with you.Do you have any other grandchildren?Mrs.GARY.Yes, we had one that was born just 5 weeks beforeLee Ann, and we have had one in January of this year. SenatorHAWKINS.Have any of them been vaccinated since yourother granddaughter's death?Mrs.GARY.Our first one has had his three shots. His mother isnow very much concerned that the time is approaching for hisfourth. She really is hesitating about having that, having learnedthrough my research that just because you have gotten through each shot doesn't necessarily. mean that there won't be damage on subsequent ones.My youngest daughter's baby was born in January. She ada-mantly refuses. I forgot to include that she also mentioned at thetime the baby diedshe happened to be visiting with us; she lives in California. She absolutely shrieked, \"It's just like Rhonda'sbaby. I know it was that shot.\" Everybody was in agreement except the doctors don't think there is any connection to it, except for some doctors.SenatorHAWKINS. Ibelieve you said in your testimony that youare working with someone to form a Massachuietts DPT group.Mrs.GARY.Yes, I have just recently been in contact with onewoman because I have been concerned about those numbers whodon't know; they have this child and they just don't know thatthere could be a relationship.I had an opportunity to talk on the phone with this one woman who has the 4-year-old, and I was the first person who had called her that had any awareness outside of her having seen the Phil Donahue program and having talked to a lawyer who is a mutual acquaintance of ours. My heart went out to that young woman be-cause she was living with this situation for 4 years. When shewould even mention her own suspicions, people raised their eye- brows at her.I think there are a lot of people out there, and I want to findthem in our State to see what kind of help we can be in a mutual support system.SenatorHAWKINS.We laud your efforts. You have been veryhelpful.Mr.SCHWARTZ.Senator Hawkins, if I may, I would just say thatwe have been spontaneously contacted by parents all over thecountry who have said, \"How do we set up local State chapters ofDPT?\" Our group hasn't gone out soliciting. They have flooded intous. So we are offering to coordinate and help put people in touchwith each other to assist, as Donna Gary has done on her own in Massachusetts. If people want to start or join State chapters of Dis-satisfied Parents Together [D131] they can write us at DPT, .Box 563, 1377 K Street NW., Washington, bc 20005, or they can call us at our answering service(202) 543-4211. We will help them formor join State chapters.Senator IlAwKINs. We appreciate that.Mr. Kudabeck, I know you are opposed to the legislation. It is my understanding that originally the State you lived in allowed a phil-osophical exemption from the shot, and then you moved to Arkan-sas where they mandate it?147 143Mr. KUDABECK. In Illinois our children were allowed exemptionsbased on our personal beliefs. In some areas, however, there is stilla bit of a problem.Senator HAWKINS. Where?Mr. KUDABECK. In some schools you can go in and sign that youwill take your children out of school for a couple of weeks if thereis an epidemic and in other schools they are adamant. It often de-pends on how high the immunization rate is in the school. If it is80 percent or better, the parents have usually had no problemswith it in the past.Senator HAWKINS. This is in Arkansas?Mr. KUDABECK. No, that is in Illinois.Senator HAWKINS. Illinois?Mr. KUDABECK. Right.Senator HAWKINS. What about Arkansas?Mr. KUDABECK. Arkansas is strictly a police state.Senator HAWKINS. It is a police state?Mr. KUDABECK. Strictly.Might I add, not to interrupt your question, but on the importantinformation forms, on the back it talks about reactions. It says, \"Ifthe person who received the vaccine gets sick and vi',4ts a doctor,hospital, or clinic in the 4 weeks after the vaccination, pleasereport it tc\"and it is left blank.Senator HAWKINS. It does not say whom to report it to?Mr. KUDABECK. No, it doesn't do that. They are supposed to havea rubberstamp.Then a little below that it saysand they went to a small cardon this\"I have read the information on this form about polio andthe oral vaccine. I have had a chance to ask questions which wereanswered to my satisfaction.\" I might add here that most parents,we have found, do not know what questions to ask and feel that to do so would be an exercise in futility since there is no choiceanyway. From our own personal experience, we have found those administering vaccines to be provaccine and minimize the risks.Direct answers to questions are often very difficult to obtain. Theform then states, \"I believe I understand the benefits\"not \"I un-derstand,\" but I believe I understand the benefits\"and risks oforal polio vaccine and request that it be given to me or to theperson named below, for whom I am authorized to make this re-quest.\"Which one of my children should I offer first as an experiment tofind out if they may be damaged? There isn't enough money in theTreasury of the United States that would replace any one of mychildren or any pp.it of them.Senator HAWKINS. Do you agree that we need to mandate theFederal Government conduct more tests on adverse reactions?Mr. KUDABECK. It would be a good idea.I think that the problem, Senator, is the fact that compensationwithout the right, without the basic, inalienable right, to say no tothat shot, will only preclude problems in the courts such as in Ar-kansas where their State epidemiologist said that he could hn.rdlywait until a compensation bill was passed because it would elimi-nate a lot of his problems.148, 144There is a mother, Joanne Cook, who had five doctors who said,\"No, you should not give your child another immunization. Don'tdo it because there could be damage.\" He will not accept that. Hesaid if they don't do it, just bring him over to the health depart- ment and \"We'll give him a shot.'Senator HAWKINS. Would you agree that the body determiningcompensation should be separate from the Federal Government?Mr. KUDABECK. Well, if they took away the mandatory vaccina-tion itself, then I think that the problem would not be there. Ithink that the normal tort system would be sufficient.Senator HAWKINS. Should parents have the right to choose to pursue their case through the tort system?Mr. KUDABECK. Yes. I think they should, yes. Senator HAWKINS. Would you support making this administra-tive remedy exclusive; that is, removing the parents' right to sue for damages through the courts, which is preventing a lot of Sena- tors from cosponsoring this bill?Mr. KUDABECK. I don't believe I understand.Senator HAWKINS. A lot of Senators want an exclusive remedy. If you are going to get compensation through the injury table, theywant to eliminate your right to choose a tort recovery.Mr. KUDABECK. The tort system altogether?Senator HAWKINS. Eliminate the tort system altogether.Mr. KUDABECK. I don't think that would be a very good idea. Senator HAWKINS. You understand a lot of these are lawyers? Mr. KUDABECK. Yes.Senator HAWKINS. Wouldyou oppose establishment At law?Senator HAWKINS. Administrative body.Mr. KUDABECK. If that were the case, Senator Hawkins, again we go back to the basic human right of saying \"no.\" If you can'tinthe OTA statement it says, \"What is a more serious weakness in the Government's defense strategy is the contention that a proper- ly warned vaccine recipient has assumed all risk of injury.\"We are coerced into signing these forms saying we request it, and then we have no option to say no. What difference does it make which way you are going to seek a remedy? I am being forcedI have been in the court for the past 8 months. I go again for a trial jury. I was found guilty of truancy because I enrolled my children in school;I did not take them out; they suspended them; theykicked them out and charged me with truancy. We enrolled themin another school. I asked the school principal at court, if I broughtthem back tk, school today, would he enroll them. He said, \"No.\"The judge, without deliberation, found me guilty, and charged me a $750 fine. He said, \"If you want a trial by jury, you have to go through this method.\" I asked for a trial by jury in the beginningand was refused that.I stood on my constitutional rights. He said, \"If you maintain your stature before me demanding those constitutional rights,you'll be in contempt of court.\"Senator HAWKINS. Do you have a lawyer?Mr. KUDABF:CK. Myself.Senator HAWKINS. Yourself.,149 145Do you know how many States have exemptions for religious orphilosophical objections? Have you made that a study?Mr. KUDABECK. If I remember correctly, it is 22 States. It is either 21 or 22; I am not sure exactly. Some of them are writtenloosely, and some are very tight.Senator HAWKINS. Thank you so much.Thank you so much for your participation here. I have a hardtime questioning you because I am on your side.Mr. KUDABECK. Thank you, Senator Hawkins.Senator HAWKINS. Our next panel of witnesses, the third panel,is a professional panel which is composed of Dr. Martin Smith, Dr.Stephen King, Dr. Jonas Salk, Mr. Andrew Dodd, and Dr. AlanNelson.I would like to state, while we are changing the name signs foryou, that Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy have a conflict.They are in a Judiciary Committee hearing at this time, but theywill read the record. They have expressed their interest in ourholding this hearing.I am interested in all the testimony given today, but I hope tohave an opportunity to question all the witnesses. Therefore, wewill submit your entire statement for the record, and we would likea summary not over 5 minutes, please, so that we can expedite thequestioning of all the witnesses.Dr. Smith, since you so ably represented the American Academyof Pediatrics in developing this legislation, we will give you theedge and let you start off.STATEMENT OF MARTIN H. SMITH, M.D., PRESIDENT-ELECT,AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICSDr. SMITH. Thank you, Madam Chairman.I am Dr. Martin H. Smith, representing the American Academyof Pediatrics, an organization of 27,000 boat ,l-certified pediatri-cians.I am here to speak in strong advocacy of the National ChildhoodVaccine Injury Compensation Act. In dealing with this particularissue, it would be well to remind the committee that the AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics has a 54-year history of existence primarilyas an advocate for children, not solely for our membership. Our ap-proach to this problem is in conformity with our purpose of advo-cating for children.We feel that this is unique legislation. Compensation legislationis not a new consideration for the Congress, but compensation leg-islation in this instance is unique. We are dealing with a productthat is required by law for the public good in all States beforeentry into school or, in some instances, before entry into any child-hood situation at any age.For over 7 years the academy has advocated as simple justice forchildren that if injury occurs, as iP 'nevitable in a very small per-centage of cases, the public owes to the victim a simple, direct, andprompt compensation, rather than an uncertain pursuit of justicethrough the prolonged and uncertain tort process.In support of this philosophic approach it is appropriate to quotehere from a 191 verdict handed down by Judge Finesilver, a Fed- 15Q 146eral district ,fudge in Colorado. lie was dealing with the settlementof a vaccine injury case when he said:So long as immunization plays a key role in our national health policy, unavoid-able adverse reactions to vaccines will remain. Only an adequate no-fault compensa-tion system can provide the necessary incentives to drug manufacturers, State andlocal health facilities, and critically, the American public, to continue to activelyparticipate in emergency immunization programs.Further on he said:National legislationis necessary to achieve this objective lest a patchwork ap-proach be taken by the individual States in their salutary efforts in providing essen-tial immunization programs.This country has never enjoyed such freedom from preventablechildhood diseases as is true at the present moment. Of all medicalprocedures, the full utilization of a complete immunization pro-gram is the easiest to document as to cost effectiveness. Yet, I mustwarn that we could be at a crisis point at any time, with either lossof supply of vaccine or such escalation of cost that it could result ina shattering of our present excellent program.Other than providing a better form of justice for children, theseconcerns for supply and cost of vaccine, and the ability to continuea full immunization program, have been the greatest reasons forthe tremendous interest of the academy in this subject.With the doses administered each year of these products, therewill be approximately two cases of paralytic polio or polio-like in-stances and at least 50 permanent neurological injuries that result.These occur without fault being involved in the part of the provid-er or the producer of the vaccine. This is the annual, year-in, year-out toll that is inevitable in maintaining an immunized population.When serious injuries occur from any one of the vaccines, theemotional and financial toll for the families involved is severe. Thefinancial stress begins immediately and it is difficult for any familyto manage these costs. These costs are continual and often willextend over the lifetime of the victim. If a financial settlement isreached under the tort process, it is usually 6 to 8 years after thesecosts have begun compounding. From the beginning, the interest ofthe Academy of Pediatrics in this legislation has been to try tobring about real justice that -is prompt and equitable for those chil-dren and their families who are the innocent victims of this diffi-cult situation.At the presere time there is no avenue for compensation for vac-cine injuries that can be sought except in the tort process. In someinstances these have resulted in huge windfall settlements, whilein other instances the victim may be unable to cope with the tedi-ous tort process and no settlement is reached. In some instancesthere has been injury and significant expense, but there may notbe enough prospect for a large enough settlement to justify thegreat deal of work needed by a thorough lawyer to bring action.Nevertheless, the constantly increasing but den of large vaccineireory settlements has had a number of serious adverse effects onvaccine supply. The number of vaccine producers has been sharplyreduced in recent years and the cost of vaccine has increased dra-matically Both of these effects have to be related to the burden ofliability the vaccine producers are carrying at the present time.The resultisthat we now have only one source of si:pply for polio.151 147measles, German measles, and mumps vaccine and only two, forpractical purposes, sources of supply for DPT vaccine. This is cer-tainly not a competit;ve situation which should be typical of theAmerican way, and it is not a comfortable, secure supply situation.We know that a real concern of the Congress will be the cost of acompensation program. We have seen the estimate of the Congres-sional Budget Office. We have not seen the details of their calcula-tions, but we believe that the program can be put in place formuch less than the Congressional Budget Office estimates. TheAcademy has commissioned an estimate by a respected Washingtoncost accour.ting firm, whose estifnates are about one-fourth the esti-mate of the Congressional Budget Office. Even these estimates areprobably high.Our report calls attention to the fact that their estimates arebased on the total cos. of the program on'the assumption that 100percent of the claimants will opt for pursuit in the compensationsystem. While this may be the best method for calculating an esti-mate, it is certainly not the realistic appraisal of what may happenin an optional system.The report calls attention to the fact that there is a considerablereal cost in operation at the present time that we have not beenable to calculate. The present liability cost under the tort process isincorporated into the present-day cost of the vaccines. That cost in-volved in the vaccines could be reduced in proportion to the accept-ance of a compensation system.A small indication of that cost is in the fact that the budget forthe Government's immunization program had to be increased $7million for the next year simply to do the same job in immuniza-tion that is given in the public sector alone. There are other coststhat are hidden in the medicaid program, crippled children's pro-gram, and other Government programs in providing care for dis-abled children.Let me again emphasize that the costs that are provided in thisreport are for total cost and not all of these costs are new costs.While this could be, looked upon as simple compensation legisla-tion to take care of another instance of product liability, let meagain stress that the justification lies in the fact that this is theonly product, to my knowledge, whose use is required by law. Thisis a unique situation that is deserving of special remedies.We are asking the Congress to assume a new responsibility inproviding a system for compensation in these special instances, butit is not an untested idea. I call your attention to the fact that vari-ations on this idea have functioned for several years in most of thewestern European nations and in Japan. Many of these nations areless capable of extending these benefits to their citizens than is thisgreat country.We have spent many hours debating some of the features thathave gone into the writing of this legislation. It would be well tomention here some of the features that require particular consider-ation and give some explanation for them.First. the legislation provides for an optional system. It certainlycould be argued that a mandatory system could be more easily administered and the cost estimates could be developed more precise-ly However, we have a great concern that the enactment of such a15,2 148mandatory system would hold up under the test of constitutional-ity. It would be certain that it would be argued that a mandatory system deprives some individuals of their access to court.Second, the legislation requires a prompt settlement of claims. This is fundamental to any improved system that is devised.Third, the law mandates an obligation to pursue improved vac- cines. This obligation now arises only through competition in themarketplace, when there is competition.Fourth, the legislation requires the reporting of reactions ratherthan the present voluntary reporting. It is hoped that mandatoryreporting will develop more exact data of the actual occurrence of reactions.Fifth, the legislation makes provision for realistic awards. It isexpected that with the awards being realistic, and with the systemgiving prompt settlements, there will be an incentive to accept the option of going into this system for settlement.This should create a moreeven form of justice as opposed to thechances in the court of finding a possible involved settlement.The academy appreciates this opportunity to present to this com- mittee and to the Congress our interests and our concerns on the entire question of vaccine injury. We recognize that the problemsinvolved here are not simple and that the answers, likewise, cannot be simple and direct answers. Yet, we are convinced that Congress can provide an answer for most of these problems. We would liketo work with the Congress in doing that. We are convinced that thetime is at hand when we must reach a direct and equitable resolu- tion of a problem that has been building for a number of years. The problem is real. The costs of a resolution are not exorbitant. The cost of continued neglect can be much greater.Thank you, anc I will be glad to answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Dr. smith follows:1 ti 149 American Academy of Pediatrics TESTIMONY BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SENATE COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCES ON THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION ACTS. 2117 PRESENTED BY MARTIN H. SMITH, M.D., F.A.A.P. MAY Mr. Chairman, Iam Dr. Martin M. smith, pediatrician in private practice fromGainesville, Georgia and president-elect of the American Academy of Pediatrics. I am here to speak in strong support of \"The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act.\" In dealing with this particular issue, it would be well toremind the committee that theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics has a fifty-four(54) year history of existence primarily as an advocate for children and our approach to this problem is consistent with that purpose.We feel that this is unique legislation. Compensation legislation 13 not a newconsideration ror the Congress, but compensation legislation in this inetanoe is unique.We are dealing with a product that is requkred by law for the publicgood in all states before entry into school or, in some instances, before entryinto any childhood group situation at any age. Forover seven years the Academyhas advoLated as simple justice for children that when an injury occurs, as isinevitable iu a very small percentage of cases, the public owes to the victim asimple, direct, and prompt compensation, rather than the uncertain pursuit ofjustice through the prolonged and uncertain tort process. In support of this philosophic approach, it is appropriate to quote from a 1981verdict handed down by Judge Sherman G. Finesilver, a federal district judge in Cslorado.In dealing with the settlement of a vaccine injury case, he stated:\"So long as immunization plays a key role in ournational health policy, unavoidable adverse reactions tovaccines will remain. Only an adequate no-fault compen-sation system can provide the necessary incentives todrug manufacturers, state and local health facilities,and critically, the American public, to continue toactively participate in emergency immunization programs.Preventive public health programs are of vital impor-tance to the nation's population. Immunization programsare lesm pxpensivn in terms of money and illness thantus unnenessary toll of human lives and well-beingbrought about by the lack of such programs. However,persons who incur illness directly related to the immu-nizati31 itself are entitled to recover compensationwithout the need to establish liability based on anillusive tort theory.\"This fieldnational immunology cries out for a moreexpeditious and fairer way of determining legitimateclaims and compensating victims of the vaccinaticn.National legislation is necessary to achieve thin objec-tive lest a patchwork approach be taken by the indivi-dual states in their salutatory efforts in providingessential immunization programs.\" (Civil Action No.78-F-452.)This ountry has nnver enjoyed such freedom from preventable childhood diseases.Of all medical procedures, the full utilization of a complete immunizationprogram in the easiest to document. im 4 cont.-effectiveness basis. Yet,I must express grave concern that we could be at a crisis point at any time, witheither loss of supply of vaccine, or .luh an escalation in oost that it could 155 151 result in a shattiving of our excellent program. Outside of developing a com-pensation program for children, our concerns for supply and cost of vaccine andthe ability to oontinue a full immunization program have been the major reasonsfor the tremendous interest of the Academy in this subject.Every year approximately 3,000,000 ohildren are born in this oountry. For theirbaste immunizing, those 3,000,000 will each require three doses of DPT and twodoses of oral polio vacoine. At eighteen months they require a booater dose ofea.:h of these vaccines and again, at school entry, a booster dose of DPT andoral polio.This results in a minimum of 15,000,000 closet' of DPT and 8,000,000doses of polio that are given each year. Even with proper administration andtile of the best vaccine products available today, we can expect a muse of polio-like disease to result out of eaoh 5,000,000 doses of polio vaccine and aserious, permanent neurological disorder to result from every 300,000 does!' ofDPT.Thus, with the annual doseS administered, there will be approximately twocases of paralytic disease and at least fifty (50) permanent neurologiclinjuries that follow. These occur at no fault on the part of the provider orthe producer of the vaccine. This is an annual year-in and year-out toll thatis inevitable if we are to maintain an immunized population.When serious injuries occur from any one of the vacoines, the emotional andfinancial toll for the families involved is severe. The financial stress beginsimmediately and it in difficult for any family to manage these costs. Thesecosts are continual and often will extend over the lifetime of the victim. If afinanoial settlement is reached under the tort process, it is usually six toeight years after these costs have begun compounding. Such a tedious legalrecourse prolongs this streas roll those children and their families who are theinnocent victims of the system.The Academy has spent a number of months negotiating with the parents' group,Dissatisfied Parents Together, to reaoh agreement on the provisiona of thisbill.We found that they had many strong oonoerns that went beyond our originalconcept of the legislation. We came to realize that their concerns were realand based on their difficult experiences and they similarly oame to appreciatethe validity of some of our concerns. We know that there are other interestedparties that will speak out on this subject and they should be heard. We areconfident that ouL of these hearings can ooms an excellent piece of legislationthat can improve our management of vaccine injuries. The time may come whenrenearch wilt be able to provide us with clean, perfect, and reaction -free vac-,7inen.However, we should not have to wait for that day to give us relief fromthree sad inItanoel.At the present time, there i3 no avenue for compensation for vaccine injuriesexcept in the tort process. In some instances these have resulted in hugewindfall settlements while in ethers the victim may be unable to cope with thetedious tort process and no settlement is reached. In other instances th..re hasbeen injury and signifieant expense, but there may not be prospect for a settle-ment large enough to iuntify the great deal of work needed by a lawyer to bring4ction.Neverthlens, the -onntintly inereaning burden of large vaccine injury settle-ments has had serious adverse effects on vaccine supply. The number of vaccine .156 152 producers has been sharply reduced in recent years and the cost of vaccine has increased dramatically. Both of these effects can be relatnd in part to theburden of liability the vaccine producers are carrying at the present time. The result is that we now have only one source of supply for polio, Measles, germanmeasles, and mumps vaccine and only three sources of supply for DPI vaccine. This is certainly not a competitive situation, which is typical or,the American way, and it dons not give one a sense of a secure supply. \\,We know that a real concern of the Congress will be in the ooat of a cempen- sation program. We have seen the estimate of the Congressional Budget Office(C80).We have not seen the detail!' of their calculations, but we believe that the program can be put in place for much leas than CB0 estimates. The Academy .commissioned a cost study by a respected Washington firm which found the pro- jected costs to be less than one-fourth the CB0 estimates and these are probably high.I would like to call attention to four variables in our study.Our study reflects the cost of institutionalization of victims that are completely and totally disabled for a normal lifespan 1p to seventy-three (73) years as well as figures for a reduced lifespan of forty (40) years.While conclusive data is not available on longevity for these individuals, I suspect that the lower lifespan is more nearly correct. If this is true, our estimates can be reduced accordingly.Secondly, the large cost of the compensation program for the first two years is based on a \"grandfather\" provision which extends retroactivity back sow, twenty years. We feel that the animate for actual cases under this provi- sion is high.It is based on each of the past twenty (20) years having producedthe same calculated number or injuries each year and each of these oases beingable to document the source of the injury and being capable of proper adjudica- tion after this period of time. If this is true, and we have reason to believeso, our estimate nan he furth.r reduced by a considerable amount.Third, our report calls attention to the fact that the estimates are based on the total cost of the program on the assumption that 221 of the claimants will opt for pursuit under the \"new\" compensation system. While this may be the best method for calculating an estimate, it is certainly not a realistic appraisal of what may happen under an optional system. And finally, the report calls atten-tion to the Net that there is a considerable real cost in operation at the pre- sent time that we have not been able to calculate. The present liability costsunder the tort process is incorporated into the present day costs of the vac- cines.That cost involved in the vaccine could be reduced in proportion to theacceptance of a compensation system. A small indication of that coat is in thefact that the budget for the federal immunization program had to be increased $7,00,000 for the r.ext year simply to maintain the immunization level in the public sector alone.

Thank you, Dr. Smith.Dr. King, could we hear from you now, from the Association ofState and Territorial Health Officers?STATEMENT OF STEPHEN H. KING, M.D., STAFF DIRECTOR,HEALTH PROGRAM OFFICE. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ANDREHABILITATIVE SERVICES, STATE HEALTH OFFICER FORTHE STATE OF FLORIDA, AND SECRETARY-TREASURER, ASSO-CIATION OF STATE AND TERRITORIAL HEALTH OFFICIALSDr. KING. Madam Chairman, my name is Stephen King. I am aphysician, State health officer for Florida, and secretary-treasurerof the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.I am pleased to appear before you today to discuss Senate bill2117. There are really two reasons for my being here. The first isthat in the last 6 months this bill has been carefully reviewed bypublic health staff in the Florida Department of Health and Reha-bilitative Services. It has kept our attention for a number of rea-sons. One, of course, is our responsibility for the large number ofinfants and children who receive vaccines and the vital human po-tential they represent for our State. In the public sector alone,Florida administers more than 855,000 doses of vaccine that arepurchased with public funds, primarily to children under 7 years ofage. The tots'. number of doses for the combined public and privatesector service delivery exceeds 1.7 million. That is 1.7 million po-tential situations which could come under the provisions of thisbill. Florida, indeed, has a tremendous stake in both the contentand the ultimate effect of this hill.The second reason for my being here today is to represent theAssociation of State and Territorial Health Officials. Members ofthe association hold the ultimate responsibility for prevention andcontrol of all vaccine-preventable diseases in their States. It wouldbe difficult tc find a group in this country, I believe, who placesgreater importance on the value of immunization in protecting thehealth of children. This point is a part of my prepared comments,Madam Chairman. I ha,e attached at the back a resolution passedby the association in 1978, and I would like to have it included forthe record, if I could.Senator HAWKINS. Without objection.Dr. KING. It is certainly in support of what this bill is attemptingto do.Progress in immunization is, by nature, a slow and gradual proc-ess. The gains which this country has made since 1977 in raisingimmunization levels to their current high points are the results ofexpanded State legislation, intensified efforts by State health de-partments, and increased Federal funding and support.Incidentally, in Florida, Federal support for the imported casesof measles and the resultant outbreaks has been essential in ourefforts to control it.It has not happened easily or quickly. This national success ismirrored in Florida. In 1977, Florida reported 308 cases of measlesto the Centers for Disease Control. In 1981, Florida passed the com-prehensive immunization law requiring immunization coverage for159 155all children in all grades. Due in large part to this law and its en-forcement, we have one confirmed case this year so far.Recent surveys of school records in Florida revealed that 97 per-cent of all children entering public and private schools in kinder-garten and first grade were adequately immunized against thechildhood diseases. Immunization levels for children in highergrades are nearly as high, though they do remain a problem for us.Our levels for all schoolchildren are believed to be the highest ofany point in the State's history.Yet, even as we congratulate ourselves on our successes, we mustremember that these levels are fragile and these levels are tran-sient. Many factors could influence our ability to maintain theselevels, and there are a number of factors. Among them are vaccineprice, parental support of our programs, and the participation ofthe private medical community.We are aware that there are rare occurrences of adverse reac-tions to these immunizations. Since our Nation is so large, theseoccurrences are also numerous. These reactions may lead to tragicand disabling medical conditions. Even as technology improves thequality of the immunizing material and the numbers of adverse re-actions hopefully drops, there may remain some level of reactionwhich is unavoidable if society continues to realize the very greatbenefits that I believe immunization programs offer.In our current legal environment, it appears that victim compen-sation for these adverse medical outcomes is difficult. Expenses forthe cost of litigation for both plaintiff and defendant are enormous.Deserving victims may not be adequately compensated. Occasional-ly, as a result, parental concerns may lead to questions of the con-tinuation of our programs, as we heard this morningprogramswhich I personally feel are among our society's most valuable andmost important.This proposed bill, therefore, is a response to an evident need fora more efficient and fair system of compensation for victims ofchildhood vaccine injury. We vaccinate all children to protect notonly themselves, but we also do it to protect the community fromdisease. I believe we owe compensation to those persons medicallyinjured for +'.,mblic good.Health prkssionals in StateFederal arenas, as well as in the private sector, have been searching for an answer to the ques-tion of compensation for vaccination injuries for over a decade. Re-member. this resolution was passed in 1978. This bill is the first na-tional effort toward a comprehensive solution to the permanetproblem posed by risks inherent in the administration of all child-hood vaccines.The association and the State of Florida laud this effort as a posi-tive public health measure with potential benefits for both individ-uals, health agencies, and the general public.I need to say there are some portions of the bill that my associa-tion and the State feel need some attention. I would like to see amore exact definition, for instance, of the medical events followingvaccinations which qualify for compensation. It is, after all, thosemedical injuries relating directly to the effects of the vaccine whichled originally to this proposed legislation. Also, there is the issue oftrue negligence. lost wages, and pain and suffering and we have1 0 156heard already a good deal about that, I think, as to the questions that have come up.Of course, the finalconcern that I would like to discuss todayvery, very briefly is the potential effect on the cost of vaccine and what impact this bill will have not only in cost of the administra- tion of the program, but the difficulties on program administration itself. I think all of these problems can be dealt with, but they are there and need to be acknowledged.I stand ready to offer the services of members of the association and of the State of Floridato assist you in dealing with these ques- tions. Our support for theconcept of compensation for inadvertentvaccine injury is unquestioned. Our support of you, Senator Haw- kins, is great in your interest on this bill. Our desire now is to fullyanswer the questions raised as they will affect millions of Ameri- can children yet to be immunized.Every year more than 3.1 million children are born in thiscoun- try. Each one of them needs the protection offered by vaccination. For the vast majority of infants, this means a series of vaccines, and I won't ginto that. However, it addsup to 25 million doses of vaccine administered annually in the United States to small chil- dren alone. Immunization of older children and adults adds an- other 10 million doses.In closing, I believe this bill is an excellent beginning to the cen- tury-old problem of vaccine injury compensation. There arepres- sures which surround this issue. They are longstanding; they are powerful; and theyare conflicting. For the sake of the greatnumber of potentially affected children in this teneration and the next and the next, we must give this bill both our support and also very careful, very reasoned attention during its legislative process.

It would be difficult to find a group in this country who places greater importance on the value of immunization in protecting the health of children, (See Attachment I) Progress in immunization is, by nature, a slow and gradual Process. .he gains which this country has made since 1977 in raising immunization levels to their current high points are the results of expanded state legis- lation, intensified efforts by stote health departments, and increased Federal funding. It did not happen easily oi Quickly. This national suc- cess is mirrored in Florida. In 1977, Florida reported 308 cases of measles to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In 1981, Florida Passed o stringent and cmorehensIve immunization law, reciviring immunization coverage for children 'n all grades. Due in large Part to the enforcement of this lcw, Florida hos reported only one confirmed measles case to CDC In 1984, Recent Kirvevs of school records in Florida revealed that 97% of all 163 159 children entering Public and Private schools in kindergarterl,and first grade were adequately immunized agoinst the childhood diseases. Immuni- zation levels for children in higher grades were nearly as high. Our levels for all school children are believed to be the highest of any Point in theAPState's history. Yet even as we congratulate ourselves on our successes, we must re- member that these levels are fragile and transient. Many factors could in- fluence our ability to maintain these levels -- factors such as vaccine Price, Parental support, and the participation of private meciteal Practi- tioners. We are aware that there are rare occurrences of adverse reactions to immunizations. Since our nation is so large these occurrences might be considered to be numerous. These reactions may lead to tragic and dis- abling medical conditions.

You are a famousdoctor.STATEMENT OF JONAS SALK, M.D., THE SALK INSTITUTE FORBIOLOGICAL STUDIES. SAN DIEGO, CADr. SALK. Madam Chairman, I have been listening very carefullyto testimony that has been given thus far, and I wish to offer forthe record what I have prepared in writing. I would like to empha-size the point that one of the available poliomyelitis vaccines [orallive virus vaccine] causes paralysis in a small number of instancesand that an alternative vaccine exists [injected killed virus vaccine]that does not cause such injury. Another vaccine that is the causeof injury is the pertussis component of Dvr. To make my point Iwould like to put the following question to the committee: If twopertussis vaccines existed, one of which causes injury and the otherdoes not, would the latter not be the one that would be used toavoid such injury? I want, therefore, to bring to your attention thefact that the live poliovirus vaccine now in general use, causesmore than the two cases per year of vaccine-associated paralysis, ashas just been stated by Dr. Smith. Such cases occur to the extent ofabout 6 to 1() cases per year and not only in children who are vacci-nated but in adults who are contacts of vaccinated children andalso in community contacts. Accumulated over the period of timesince the live poliovirus vaccine has been in use, more than 200cases have accumulated over the period of the last 20 years.In view of the fact that a killed poliovirus vaccine exists whichdoes not cause vaccine-associated paralysis, I would suggest thatthe way to deal with polio-vaccine-associated injuries would be.toexclude indemnification for polio-vaccine-associated injuries fromthe legislation so as to create an incentive to avoid such injurysince the killed virus vaccine is equally effective in protecting thevaccinated individual and the community from the development ofoutbreaks of poliomyelitis.This issue has been a subject of considerable discussion for quitescme time. These facts were brought prominently to attentionmore than a decade ago. The conditions that have prevailed in theptst as far as questions of equivalence of effectiveness of the killedvirus vaccine which is safe as compared with the live virus vaccinethat does cause injury, have now, in 1984, been resolved because ofadvances in the science and the technology of killed virus vaccinemanufacture. If the science and the technology of pertussis vaccinemanufacture was similarly advanced then the use of an improvedvaccine would he introduced rather than indem ttication. Mysimple plea is that indemnification is not necessary for solving theproblem of polio-vaccine-associated injuries.The prepared statement of Dr. Salk follows:] 169 165 StatementonNATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION ACT byJonas Salk, M.D.The Salk Institute for Biological StudiesPost Office Box 85800San Diego, California 92133 .Prepared ForThe Committee cn Labor and Human ResourcesThe United States SenateWashington, L.C.3 May 1934 170 166 I an here to offer my views on legislation now being considered to provide compensation by the United States government to victims of vaccine-related injuries. I believe that such victims shouldreceive fair and adequate compensation without the necessity toengage in uncertain lawsuits with producers of biologics, and their insurers, who understandably will use their power to defend theirinterests which differ from that of the victim. I have two serious concerns with regard to such legislation:- One is the removal of the incentive for manufacturersand the scientific community to improve existing vaccines--for example, the pertuasis component of the DPT vaccine.- The other is the removal of the incentive to change policy when equally effective but safer vaccines already exist- -for example, poliomyelitis vaccine. Therefore, such legislation should provide for:- Encouragement of research and development of vaccines freeof the untoward side effects for which indemnification is to be provided. With regard to pertussis, further research and development is underway. However, in the case of poliomyelitis two vaccines exist, one of whichhas the property of causing a small but definite number of cases of 171 167 paralytic poliomyelitis each year and the other of which is free of this property. Figure 1 shows the effect of vaccination onincidence of poliomyelitis in the United States, and Figure 2 showsthat since 1973 more polio cases have been caused by the live virus vaccine as compared to the number caused by the naturally occurring wild virus.The issue surrounding these observations has been dis-cussed many times and will, in due course, be resolved by appropriate changes in policy or by legislation. In summary:I am of the opinion that such legislation as is beingproposed is necessary but should be written in such away as to provide the kinds of safeguards that wouldavoid the need for indemnification as a remedy for vaccine-associated injuries. 172 /41.0.00....1111 100168 Figure 1 Incidence of total reported poliomyelitis in the United States, 1920-1971.

Although I support no-fault compensa- tion for vaccine Injury that cannot avoided, one must carefully consider the wisdom of legislating compensatio or injuries that are unnecessary. Use of oral, live poliovirus vaccine car es the inherent risk of inducing '\\ paralytic disease, whereas an alternative ccine is available that is equally effective but carries no Such risk. It is my opinion that livepoliovirus vaccine should not be icluded in gislation concerningcompensation of vaccine injuries until careful consideration has been made of the legal, etnical, and economic implications of such action.Oral, live poliovirus vaccine is also called OPV or Sabin-type poliovirus vaccine.Every year, the Centers for Disease Control receive an average of nine reports of permanent paralysis caused by the live poliovirus vaccine. It is likely that additional cases occur but are not reported. Approximately one-third of the cases are infants who received live poliovirus vaccine, one-third are young adults (primarily parents) who come in contact withvaccinated infants, and one-third are in other children or adults who come in contact with vaccinated persons. Those people who are paralyzed aftercoming in contact with a vaccinated person have never consented to bevaccinated and are usually unaware they are at risk of contracting paralyticdisease.Nine cases annually seems like a small number, but it must be examined in context.In the first place, these cases involve permanent paralysis or loss of life, injuries that are particularly tragic and costly to society when .hey occur in infants or young parents. Secondly, disease due tooLairring polioviruses has essentially been eliminated from theunited ',fat's: except for imported cases and one outbreak of poliomyelitisorten into.the unvaccinated Amish community in 1Q79, virtually all cases of oar-II/tic wliomyelitis since 1974 have been caused by the live poliovirus vAc:Inc.Live poliovirus vaccine now causes more disease than the virus 3111ur,t 4/11-h ;I.15 .Jsi-m. 174 170 The occurrance of vaccine-associated a result of instabilityinherent in the live poliovirus vaccine; such cases will continue to occuras long as the vaccine is used. This situation would be tolerable, and no-fault compensation might be reasonable, if there were no alternative vaccine.Another vaccine is available, however, that is equally effective in preventingparalytic poliomyelitis in individuals and in controlling the disease in thecommunity.Killed poliovirus vaccine is prepared from viruses that are deadand cannot cause disease; this vaccine, given by injection, is also referredto as inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) or Salk-type brought poliomyelitis under control in the UnitedStates in the 1950s and early 1960s. Live poliovirus vaccine was then intro-duced and became the vaccine of choice for a variety of reasons; use of killedpoliovirus vaccine gradually declined. After hearings in the Health Subcom-mittee of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee in September, 1976,when testimony was given by Dr. Jonas Salk, poliomyelitis vaccination policywas reviewed by a special committee of The Institute pf Medicine in March, 1977.The committee included physicians, lawyers, manufacturers, clergy, politicians,and consumer representatives. The committee recommended (1) continued use oflive poliovirus vaccine for primary immunization of infants, (2) use of killedpoliovirus vaccine for certain specific circumstances, and (3) a review ofpoliomyelitis vaccination policy in 5 years (March, 1982). No such reviewby 4 broadly representative body has yet been undertaken, although many of thecircumstances considered by The Institute of Medicine committee in 1977 nolonger apply in 1983.As you might expect, many lawsuits have been filed against individualphysicians and vaccine manufacturers as a result of live virus vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. In addition, however, cases are nowpending against the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Governmentfor their actions regarding live poliovirus vaccine.

We're glad you came,also.Mr. Dodd, an attorney from Torrance, CA?STATEMENT OF ANDREW DODD, ATTORNEY, WARD, DODD &GRANT, TORRANCE, CAMr. Dom. Yes, Senator. I am briefly going to summarize what Ihave already submitted to the committee.That is that there are candidates in our society today allegedlysuffering froth pertussis injury, pertussis vaccine-related injury,who are not candidates for litigation. This bill presents an alterna- tive for those children.I, myself, over ,the past 4 years have seen three of these children,and I think it is very important that the committee understandthat, in that sense, I am not biased, because this bill will, in my opinion, benefit at least three children who have undoubtedly meri-torious claims but are not appropriate candidates for litigation.Any litigator in the United States today who is presented withan allegedly vaccine-related injury must face two issues. The firstissue is who manufactured the vaccine. One of the issues that hasdealt with this bill, of course, requires mandatory reporting by theadministering physician of vaccine manufacturer identity. Howev-er, that has not been true over the past 40 to 50 years. Consequent-ly, there is a serious problem in the legal profession in attemptingto obtain identification of manufacturers rnvolved. If you do nothave manufacturer identification, you then in most States in theUnited States have no lawsuit.Now the people who fall into that category would benefit greatly,in my opinion, by this bill, because they would have an opportunityto seek compensation for what is an extremely devastating injuryto a family unit in terms of finances.With regard to the pertussis vaccine-injured children, that injurypresents in many ways. One of the ways that it presents in is achild with a mental capability which never exceeds 18 to 24months, no matter what the chronological age is. You have a childin that instance who is basically uncontrolled; who may be partial-ly controlled by medication, although not necessarily; a child whowill require a sheltered environment for the rest cf that child's life;a child whose quality of life may, we hope, be somewhat improvedby the application of rather substantial sums of money.The other issue faced by any litigator with a vaccine-injuredchild is the question of medical causation. Dr. Brandt from HHShas briefly discussed that, and he was talking about the difficultyof establishing a causal relationship between vaccination andinjury. This, of course, is an issue which litigators must face everyday.With regard to pertussis vaccine-injured children, who are thatgroup that I am most familiar with, there are cases which, recauseof other possible causes, while they are very meritorious and whilethey certainly meet the ethical constraints that are pertinent toany attorney practicing in this area insofar as being legitimateclaims. they may be in the position of being weak medically, on themedical causation side, and, consequently, parents of those types of176 172children do not haveaccess to our court system. I believe thatthese children would also benefit very greatly by the compensation aspect of this bill.The balance of this bill, relating to the questions of reporting and data collection, relating to the mandates to the Secretary to make investigations, these thingsare utterly unique. These are not paral-lel enactments that pattern after something that we could now do in the law. These are very important because they relate to culpa- bility.In order to show, ifwe can, that vaccine manufacturers havebeen negligent in the manufacture of pertussis vaccine, we must have records and we must have the ability to identify manufactur- er~.Dr. Smith, who I know has worked many hours on the bill, one of the things that he prepared in his statement today was that pos- sibly 15 to 50 vaccine-related injuries occur a year without fault on the part of the manufacturer. Now that, of course, is something that I would respectfully take exception with the good Dr. Smith on.In any event, the question of whether or not manufacturers are liable for these injuries is not something that we could say that a very distinct trend has developed in the courts to determine. It stillremains to be seen to what extent, for instance, the manufacturers of pertussis vaccine are culpable. As several of the defense attor- neys who are seated in this room in back of me will confirm, therehas never been a concession by a drug manufacturer that pertussis vaccine is particularly dangerous or that they bear any culpability under the law.Each one of these cases, Iassure the Senator, is competently de-fended. There are competent expert witnesses on each side. When you face litigation, it is very important that the public understandthat we don t necessarily always have these wonderful results that we all learn from Perry Mason. It is a rigorous kind of thing to do, and there are neople who don't fit into that category. Now to speak tosome of the questions, to take the remainder ofmy time to speak to soine of the questions the Senator has raised,would parents choose this system? I think there areI know of three sets of parents myself who would. I think the answer is clear- ly yes, people would choose this system.If this bill were to become mandatory to require this kind of mandatory administrative procedure for adjudication of claims, which I understand the Senator to have indicated that some of the potentiftl cosponsors of the bill have expressed an interest in,I must, unfortunately, indicate that I would do all in my power at that point to oppose the legislation, and I believe that the parents thatI represent throughout the United States would feel likewise. The net effect of that proposal, although it may be quite uninten- tional. is going to sweep what we believe to be the activities of the drug manufacturers with regard to pertussis vaccine under the rug. Itis going, in effect. although again it may not be intended, to act :is a bailout for the drug manufacturers in regard to pertussis im-inuni/at ionThere are estimated to hesome :i11 to 40 cases presently pendingin the trnited States on the question of pertussis immunization. To177 173destroy those cases by passing a mandatory legislation, I thinkwould be entirely inappropriate, I would submit.I was very ,pleased to hear Dr. Smith mention a As the acade- my has identified, there are serious constitutio,,a1 questions to doing that. You are talking about taking away from a child theright to a jury trial. In the case of a pertussis-injured child, you aretalking about taking the right of a minor who is also a retardedperson, taking away the right for a jury trial. I submit that thatwould not he acceptable to many people that I know.One last point that Dr. Brandt raisedand, of course, the com-munication of ideas by the use of word of mouth is not an exactscience, and I may have thought that I understood Dr. Brandt tosay things that he did not say, but I thought he said that the ad- ministration is concerned that the passage of this bill could lead toa lack of public confidence in immunization policy.I think the truth of the matter, Senator Hawkins, is that this coymittee pres-ently is the sole and leading safety valve for what many counselfeel is an incredible scandal of incredible proportion. This commit-tee provides a forum for people of opposing views to come together and talk about these problems. The transcripts of this committeehave indicated opinions of a wildly divergent nature.We have an accusation, I believe, in the records of this commit-tee that even for a television station to put this issue on the air is journalistic malpractice. The point of it is, and what drives peopleto make those kinds of statements is, that this whole. issue has become polarized. There are people on one side and people on theother. This committee, I believe, has provided the safety valve forthis issue. It is very much to the credit of this committee.The real, clear, and present danger in this issue is that debatewill be silenced; that there will be no discussion in the press aboutthis issue; and that ultimately, the information that is comingslowly but surely in the court system in the United States aboutspecifically pertussis manufacture will break, the public will beenormously upset, in my humble opinion, and we run the dangerthere that you are going to have a lack of acceptance of immuniza-tions that are appropriate.For instance, people may, if they learn about pertussis vaccine, ifthey determine in their own mind that it is an outmoded prOduct,that the design of the product is some 53 years of age, if they deter-mine they don't want their children to have that, and if that is per-mitted in their State by law, we run the risk that those parentsmay become confused and also try to deny diphtheria and tetanus vaccination. Diphtheria and tetanus, as I am sure the members ofthis panel know better than I do, are not something to fool aroundwith. They are an extremely dangerous series of childhood illness-es.If we stop this debate, if legislation is not passed, then we aregoing to leave it again in the laps of the litigators. The litigatorsare doing their best, Senator Hawkins, but our access to informa- tion is certainly short of CDC; it is short of DOB; it is short of FDA.Why those people have not chosen to exercise access into all of the information available, I don't know, but the suggestion that thiscommittee is somehow going to contribute to the lack of public con- -1178 174fidence,Ireally respectfully submit is a complete reverse of thetruth.Thank you.[The prepared statement of Mr. Dodd SenateCommittee on Labor and Human ResourcesWashington, D.C. 20510In re:S.2117, The National Childhood Vaccine InjuryCompensation ActTestimony of Andrew W. Dodd, EsquireDear Senator Hatch:Thank you for your kind letter of April 24, 1984.I have been asked to comment upon the appropri-ateness of S.2117 from the perspective of a litigator withsome experience in casIs of post vaccine pertussis encepha-lopathy.In this regard I should note at the outsetthat7very much favor the legislation, under considerationby your Committee, both from a orofessional perspective andon a phii.Jsophical basis as a m,ilber of this society andas the parent of pediatric immunization age children.On this latter point, the philosophical per-spective, it is my feeling that the recognition implicit 0in the legislation, that there exists a serious problem withpertussis immunization, is an appropriate legislative finding,one which has been much too long in coming.There was a time, not too long ago, when Iwas of the opinion that the mere recital to appropriateauthorit'.es in the health care delivery system of the bold-faced facts with regard to pertussis vaccine would, .urely,be sufficient to bring about change in the manner in whichthis product is in daily use.After three years of letter writing I no longerLllve In this approach.Therefore,I applaud the efforts of this Com-mittee with reward to the preliminary fact finding process,espeoially the efforts of The Honorable Paula Hawkins. 176 On my first.point, a litigator's perspective,my view is perhaps best explained by a brief summary ofthe manner in which a typical suspected case of pertussisvaccine damage is handled by this firm.Typically initial investigation of these cases involves, in part, the following steps, 1)In most states the United States, withthe possible exception of California, it is an absolutecondition precedent to litigation that the identity of themanufacturer of the pertussis vaccine in question be estab-lished.This \"manufacturer identification\" has proved to be a most difiicult aspect of these cases inasmuch as it is clearly not the practice of the physicians in this country to note in a child's medical chart, or elsewhere, such iden-tification.Indeed, one landmark case in the 60's on this product was reportedly lost, in part, because no such man.iacturer identification was forthcoming. 2)Assuming that manufacturer identification is forthcoming, which is not always the case, the next step is that of establishing medical causation.In this regard it is important to note that thte is no single \"test\" to determine whether or not a child has been damaged by pertussis immunization.Rather, the process by which such a diagnosis is rendered involves, in part, a qui,e complicated and la-borious process of examination of each and every meuical record ever generated with respect to a patient plus a battery ofvarious diagnostic tests.Inherent in this process is the fact, whichIfrequently ,ee, that inadvertent errors often creep into A patient's .Ards. 1 SI 177 Once these two steps are aaccomplished it thenbecomes necessary to makd a determination as to whether ornot a particular child's claim is a proper candidate forlitigation.This is not an easy decision to make, especiallyin view of the fact that attorneys involved in this field,most certainly the ones that I am acquainted with, are quitecognizant of the fact they are operating as a \"Court oflast resort\", ie., there is nowhere else,under the presenttort system, for parents of portussis vaccine effectedchildren to go.As against this judicial fact of life counselmust balance the faits inherent in his own professional prac-tice, tnc expense and rigors of litigation and the variousethical constraints inherent in the practice of law, mostespecially the mandate that counsel shall not accept morecases than he has the time and resources to prosecute.This balancing of various considerations haslead to, at least in my own practice, a kind of legal\"triage\" wherein cases without extremely solid and con-vincing drug manufacturer identification, and medicalcausation, mist, be turoed down ia favor of cases that are\"stronger\" in the evidentary sense.The net effect, theref:ae, of this \"triage\"process in that cases which undoubtedly are meritorious,and which meet ethical cnstrainte regarding valid andappropriate claims must, regrettably, be turned aside, orat least delayed, in favor of \"stronger\" aaims.As against this process of screening the legis-latin under, consideration would, in my view, greatly assistin the resclutioa of the problems I have briefly outlinedtirinaboi.e 'mhetent in the traditional tort system.That is, asI perceive the effect of this legis-lation, counsel involved in the area of pertussis immunizationlitlAattoe would be provided with a choice, either to pursaettadItional litlqation or to proceed by the alternativeme hoot1, ovi Jed for in the hill. I 5 2 OP.178 Inasmuch as the bill under consideration doesnot require drug manufacturer identifica:ion, ncr Aloes the same require the claimant to meet rigolk.us evidentiarystandards with regard to medical causation, the proposedlegislated alternative thereforepresents a \"real' choice to parents faced with pertussis vaccine effected children.It is the provision for such a \"real* choicewhich persuades me, from a litigator's perspective, thatthe subject bill in both appropriate, and necessary.Indeed, on a very personal level, I should be remiss ifI did not disclose to this Honorable Committeethat it is my intention, should the bill under consideration be enacted, to file claims on behalf of three children whose claims, in my opinion, are not appropriate candidates for traditional litigation. espIly submitted, drew W. DoddAWb/de.eg,0 Senator HAWKINS. Thank you, Mr. Dodd. I personally appreciatethose remarks, having been accused of the very things you are talking about.Dr. Alan Nelson of the American Medical Association?STATEMENT OF ALAN R. NELSON, M.D., AMERICAN MEDICALASSOCIATIONDr. NELSON. Thank you, Madam Chairman.My name is Alan Nelson. Iam a practitioner of internal medi- cine in Salt Lake City, UT, and I am also a member of the AMA board of trustees.Madam Chairman, the AMA has over the years strongly urged immunization of children and has long supported public healthgrants to States to assist in immunization programs. The AMA en- courages and supports State-mandated childhood vaccination re- quirements and continued research into the development of new and approved vaccines. The AMA Auxiliary has also developed and implemented major public education programs encouraging appro- priate immunizations.The beneficial results of this Nation's immunization activity are clear. For example, through the development and widespread avail-ability of vaccines, polio has been virtually eliminated.We are fully aware, Madam Chairman, of the injuries and ill- nesses that can result from the administration of vaccines. Evenwhen there is no negligence in the manufacture or administration of a vaccine, scientific evidence indicates that there is a predictable incidence of serious injuries that will inevitably occur in a certain small number of cases.Such cases are, indeed, small in relation to the total number of doses administered. But, regardless of the rarity of these tragicevents, a.ny serious adverse reaction is a matter of crucial concern to one who is din ly affected.1S3 179Our tort system provides a remedy for persons injured by negli-gent conduct of another. The problem confronted in the context ofvaccine administration is that an injury may result even when noone has committed a negligent act.The moral problem for society arising from such injuries is thatmost States require pediatric vaccinations as a condition to schoolentry. Isitfair to require children to undergo vaccinations andthen deny compensation in those rare instances of injury? Is it fairto leave compensation for children to innovations in tort theorythat find liability even when there was no negligence? This is thedilemma that has faced and continues to face our society concern-ing vaccine injury cases.The AMA has actively participated in the pursuit of fairness forchildren injured seriously as a result of mandated pediatric vacci-nations. We have also been concerned about liability problems forvaccine manufacturers and for those who administer vaccines. Inseeking this fairness, we advocate solutions that will continue toencourage parents to have their children immunized. We also seeka course of action that will preserve a ready supply of reasonablyprict..; vaccinesa goal that has moved farther from reach as thenumber of vaccine suppliers declines and vaccine prices increase asa result of product liability litigation.We must, also assure continued research not only into improve-ments in vaccines that are currently available, but we must assurecontinued research into new vaccines for diseases for which thereis no prevention now, or perhaps even for diseases for which thecause has not yet been determined.The AMA in 1983 convened a special Ad Hoc Commission onVaccine Compensation, on which I had the privilege to serve aschairman, as a forum to examine all aspects of the vaccine injurycompensation and to provide recommendations for appropriate leg-islative remedy. In addition to the AMA, nine other organizationswere represented on the commission. These organizations includedthe American Academy of Pediatrics, the Pharmaceutical Manufac-tures Association, the Institute of Medicine of the National Acade-my of Sciences, Centers for Disease Control, and the National Con-ference of State Legislatures. All of these organizations designateda member of our commission.Madam Chairman, the commission has recently completed itsreport, and this report is appended to our full statement. Thereport of the commission is now being circulated to the organiza-tions that were represented on the commission, so that each orga-nization can react to the policy positions embraced in the commis-sion's recommendations. Last week the board of trustees of theAmerican Medical Association adopted the report of the commis-sionThe commission's goals were four:To identify and equitably compensate persons injured by severereactions to pediatric vaccines;Second, to assure the appropriate vaccination of all children;Third, assure the continued development and availability of pedi-atric vaccines; andFourth. assure the continued participation of physicians eadother qualified persons in the administration of pediatric vaccine. 180The report presents 13 major recommendations, including a rec-ommendation calling for a Federal legislative program for the ap-propriate compensation of persons seriously injured as a result ofState-mandated vaccinations a.id a recommendation that such acompensation system must be the exclusive remedy of claimantsand not merely an alternative to remedies currently available.The program envisioned by the commission report would involvea no-fault claims review process and would permit the Federal Gov-ernment to recover from a negligent party amounts it pays onclaims.At this time I would like to present the views of' the AMA onmajor features of Senate bill 2117.first, the Government program is an optional remedy. A majorfeature of S. 2117 is the establishment of a Federal compensationprogram as an alternative to the traditional tort remedy ratherthan being the sole source of compensation for vaccine-related inju-ries. Permitting claimants to continue to bring tort actions againstmanufacturers and providers will not achieve desired goals in ourview, since sufficient protection is not provided from the increas-ingly high expense of litigation that is driving manufacturers' costsup, costs that have been asserted as forcing companies out of vac-cine production.Beneficial legislation should strike a fair balance between the de-sirable goal of compensating the victims of serious injuries and theneed for vaccine-producing companies to operate in an environ-ment with some measure of protection from the extremely highlegal costs in this complicated and threatening area of law.Madam Chairman, the commission tried very diligently to get ahandle on the degree of current legal activity against those who ad-minister and produce vaccines. It was very difficult to do so. As amatter of fact, we were unable to come up with any kind of hardnumbers.However, an attorney who deals extensively with this kind ofproblem estimated in his report to the commission that in the Chi-cago area alone 4 to 50 suits are estimated to be filed chargingvaccine-related injury.Private tort remedy as an option, however, would not promotethe desired goal of removing exis.ing barriers to achieving the nee.essary goals of providing for continued availability of vaccines atreasonable cost and maximum immunization coverage of our popu-lationThe vaccine injury table: the bill contains a vaccine injury tablethat lists in great specificity a large number of compensable eventsand time periods for onset of those events. Many are too nonspeci-fic and do nut constitute a reliable clinical indication. The systemcm:Id be floodedThe American Medical Association strongly recommends againsthaving compensable injuries listed in the legislation. Identificationof compensabie events through administrative procedures may be anwre desirable alternativeSurcharges on vaccine ma n 11 fact ti re rs: We 'are ,'oncerned that the;urcharge method of financing called for in Senate bill 2117 willHilly accelerate the already high cost of vaccine since it adds to cur-rent costs by virtue of adoption Of a new system of compensation. L 181Because the ent ire population benefits from immunization, not justthose unmunized, a more appropriate financing system might beone that ultimately relies on general revenue funding. Other concerns: In addition to these major concerns, questionsare also raised relating tothe immunizations covered, statute oflimitations, provisions as set forth in the bill relating to compensa-tion for toss of earnings, and definition of maximum feasible poten-tial.We commend you, Senator Hawkins, for seeking development ofa means to assist childrenwho are seriously injured through theadministration of mandated vaccines. We urge the committee toconsider the recommendations of the commission on vaccine com-pnsation submitted with our testimony. We believe these recom-mendations could provide a framework for a beneficial solution totF'vaccine injury compensation problem. We would be happy towork with this committee in developing a program accomplishingour mutual goals.While S.2117 also addresses these issues, itcontinues thepresent tort system that has resulted in serious problems in thisfield. For this and other reasons contained in our statement, weare opposed to enactmentof Senate bill 2117 as it is currently writ-ten.Madam Chairman. I would be happy to answer any questions.(The prepared statement of Dr. Nelson follows:i 182 STATEMENTof theAMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONto the Committee on Labor and Human ResourcesUnited States Senate Presented byAlan R. Nelson, N.D. RE:S. 2117 - the Rational ChildhoodVaccine-Injury Compensation Act MAY 3, 198 Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:My name is Alan R. Nelson, M.D. I am a physician in the practice ofinternal medicine in Salt Lake City, Utah. I am a member of the AMA'sBoard of Trustees. With me today is Harry Peterson, Director of theAMA's Division of Legislative Activities.The American Medical Association is pleased to be at this hearing topresent its views on vaccine compensation issues and on S. 2117, a billthat would establish a new federal program to provide compensation topersons injured as a result of receiving vaccine immunizations.AMA and ImmunizationMrChairman, the AMA has over the ylars strongly urged immunizationof children and has long supported federal public health grants to 9S7 183 states to assist in immunization programs. The AMA encourages and supports state mandated childhood vaccination requirements and continued research into the development of new and improved vaccines. The AMA Auxiliary has also developed and implemented major public educationprograms encouraging appropriate immunizations.The beneficial results of this nation's immunization activity are clear.Today, through the development and witispread availability ofvc,.nes, polio has been virtually eliminated. According to the Centersfor Disease Control, the incidence of mumps has fallen from 121,550 casesas recently as 1971 to 3,285 last year, and cases of measles havedeclined from 75,007 in 1971 to 1,436 in 1983.We are fully aware, Mr. Chairman, of the injuries and illness thatcan result from the administration of vaccines. Even when there is no negligence in the manufacture or administration of vaccine, scientificevidence indicates that there is a predictable incidence of serious injuries that will inevitably occur in a certain small number of cases. Such cases aro indeed small in number in relation to the total number of doses administered. For example, polio contracted from oral poliovaccine is estimated to occur once in 3.2 million doses, leading to an estimated 5 cases in a year. Encephalitis following DTP vaccineadministration is estimated to occur 3.2 times per million doses leading to an estimated 43.2 cases per year. Encephalitis following measlesvaccination is estimated to result in about 10 cases per year. Deaths due to anaphylactic shock from all vaccines is estimated to be one in tenmillion do =es i4r a total of five to six cases per year. Other adverseevents. such as peripheral mononeuropathy following DTP vaccine, occurvery rat-ely, probably too rarely for even one case annually. 1 S\\ 184 Regardless of the comparative rarity of these tragic events, anyserious adverse reaction is a matter of critical concern to one who isdirectly affected.Our tort system peovides a remedy for persons injured by thenegligent conduct of another. The 2oblem confronted in the context ofvaccine ancommitted a negligent act.The moral problem for society arising from such injuries is that moststates require certain pediatric vaccinations as a condition to schoolentry.States mandate such immunization because of the epidemiologicfact of -herd immunity,\" i.e.. all of society benefits from vaccinationagainst communicable diseases--not just the vaccine recipient. Is itfair to require children to undergo vaccinations, and then denycompensation in those rare instances of severe injury? Is it fair toleave compensation for children to innovations in tort theory that findliability even when there was no negligence? This is the dilensea thathas faced and continues to face our society concerning vaccine injury(asegThe American Medical Association has actively participated in thepursuit for fairness for children injured seriously as a result ofmandated pediatric vaccines, for vaccine administrators, and for vaccinemanufacturers. In seeking this fairness, we advocate solutions that willcontinuo to encourage parents to have their children immunized. We alsoseek a course of action that will preserve a ready supply of reasonablypriced vaccines--a goal that has moved farther from reach as the numberof vaccino suppliers declines and vaccine prices increase as a result ofproduct liability litigation. 1 S 185 In the process of working towards a solution, the AMA in previousyears endorsed the concept of vaccine compensation programs at the state Devil.The Association developed model state legislation and encouragedsupport by state medical associations. The Association also supportsstate or federal legislation that will hold physicians and manufacturersharmless for any vaccine-related injury not caused by physician ormanufacturer negligence.Most significantly, the AMA in 1983 convened a special Ad HocCommission on Vaccine Compensation, on which I had the privilege to serveas Chairman, as a forum to examine all aspects of the vaccine injurycompensation problem and to provide recommendations for any appropriatelegislative remedy. In addition to the AMA, the following organizationswere represented on the Commission: oAmerican Academy of Family PhysiciansoAmerican Academy of PediatricsoAmerican Society of Internal MedicineoNational Medical AssociationoAmerican Association of Public Health PhysiciansoInstitute of MedicineoNational Conference of State LegislaturesoPharmaceutical Manufacturers AssociationCenters for Disease Control (HHS) MrChairman, the Commission has recently completed its report, and thereport is appended to our testimony. The report of the Commission is nowbeing circulated to the organizations represented on the Commission sothat each organization can react to the policy position embraced in theCommission's recommendations. Last week, the Board of Trustees of theAmerican Medical Association adopted the Report of the Commission, andthis Report will now be transmitted to the AMA House of Delegates for itsrnnsideratinn next month. 186 The Report of the ComMission on Vaccine Injury, Compensation containsthe following recommendations: 1.All children should receive the childhood immunizationsrecommended by the American Academy.of Pediatrics and theAmerican Medical Association. 2.A federal legislative program should be pursued for theappropriate compensation of persons seriously injured as aresult of state mandated pediatric immunizations. 3.The proposed compensation system must be the exclusiveremedy of claimants and not merely an alternative toremedies currently available. 6.Legislation should create a no-fault claims review process. 5.The federal government should recover amounts it pays onclaims from any negligent party. 6.All persons seriously injured as the direct result ofrequired pediatric immunizations should be compensated. 7.The Secretary of RHS should be directed by the implementinglegislation to constitute an expert advisory group todefinthe injuries that would be presumptively compensableunder the program. 8.Compensable events should not be defined in thelegislation, but should be defined wholly by the expertadvisory group and promulgated as an administrative rule.with usual notice and comment period. 9.Awards should include medical and other needed care,rehabilitation, special education. and other strictlycompensatory elements not covered by other programs. Anypain and suffering compensation should be limited with theaward going only to the injured party. 10.The dollar amount of awards would be hazed on a formuladeveloped by a second expert advisory committee formed ofexperts in this kind of economic analysis. These formulaswould also be promulgated as administrative rules. 11.The formula referred to above should encourage structuredsettlements, limit fees going to legal counsel, givepreference to regional formulas that give cognizance tosocioeconomic differences between regions, and focus onlocal agencies as the locus for making judgments within theformula as to needs in individual cases. 191 .187 12.Determinations made ty the Secretary regarding a persoL\"seligibility for compensation and the amount of awardsshould carry a presumption of substantial evidence withrespect to any judicial review. Judicial review would beappellate, not leja944, 13.Funding options were considered but no one formulaembraced.However, the Commission was concerned about acharge added to vaccines. S. 2117At this time, I would like to present the views of the AMA onS. 2117, a bill before this Committee on the subject of vaccinecompensation.eisap1-.191Lof S. 2117. S. 2111 would establish a federalvaccine-injury compensation program. It would be a no-fault, electiveavenue to compensation on the part of persons suffering from certaininjuries caused by designated vaccines who meet eligibility requirementsset out in the bill. It is no-fault in that there would to no need for aclaimant to demonstrate negligence in order to receive an award, and itis elective in that a person may choose to pursue either the traditionaltort remedy in the courts or the new comeensatimjuggEgm. Payments toclaimants under the latter program would come from a trust fundconstituted from surcharges levied on manufacturers of childhood vaccines.The bill thus provides that any person who has sustained avaccine-related injury (as id...cified in the bill) may elect to seekcompensation under the program established by the bill as an alternativeto filing a tort action for damages in state or federal court.Petitions for compensation under the program would be submitted tothe U.S. District Court for the District of Colwabia. Upon the entry ofproposed findings of fact and conclusions of law by the special master or 991 188 magistrate appointed by the Court, or upon entry of a final judgment bythe court on the pet ionthere would be a permanent bar against thefiling, or furtheronsideration, of any tort action in any state orfederal court arising from the same incident of vaccine administration.Compensation would be awarded to a petitioner when the following fourcriteria are met: (1)The petitioner received any of the vaccines listed in theVaccine-Injury Table set forth in the bill (whether the vaccinewas admin%stered before or after the date of enactment of the bill). (2)The petitioner sustained or had aggravated any of the illnesses,disabilities, injuries or conditions listed in theVaccine -Injury Table (whether the illness, disability, etc.,occurred or was discovered before or after the date of thebill's enactment). (3)The first symptom or manifestation of the onset or significantaggravation of any such illness, disability, etc., occurredwithin the requisite time period after vaccine administration,as set forth in the Vaccine-Injury Table. (A)The petitioner has not previously collected an award crsettlement of a civil action in tort for damages for suchvaccine-elated injury.The bill provides that a petitioner contracting polio need not havereceived polio vaccine to be eligible if the petitioner contracted poliofrom some other person as a result of oral polio vaccine. 193 189 Comments on S. 2117In these comments we will discus certain of our principal concernswith S. 2117.GovarligaMaJUMENLJULJU1kWALLEMtiX. A major feature of S. 2117 isthe establishment of the federal compensation program as an alternativeto the traditional tort remedy, rather than being the sole source ofcompensation for vaccine-related injuries. Given the important goals ofpromoting the vaccination of children and assuring the ready availabilityof vaccine to meet that objective, legislation should be fashioaed tohelp achieve those goals. Permitting claimants to continue to bring tortactions against manufacturers and providers will not achieve desiredgoals, in our view, since sufficient protection is not provided from theincreasingly high expense of litigation that is driving manufacuturercosts up--costa that have been asserted as forcing companies out ofvaccine production.Beneficial legislation should strike a fair balance between thedesirable goal of compensating victims of serious vaccine injuries andthe need for vaccine producing companies to operahe in an environmentwith some measure of protection from the extremely high legal costs inthis complicated and threatening area of law. S. 2117 seeks to meet thedesirable goal of affording relief to individuals suffering injuries andwho otherwise would have no remedy for compensation. By preserving theprivate tort remedy a'. 2\" on, however, S. 2117 would not promote thedesirable goal of .dating barriers to achieving the necessarygoals of providing for continued availability of vaccines at reasonablecosts and maximu:s immunization coverage of our population. a19418-454 0 - 84 - 13 rp.190 Vaccine Indury Table. S. 2117 contains a Vaccine-Injury Table that lists in great specificity a large number of compensable events and time periods for onset of those events; the Table-404n integral part of the legislation and would be used to determine eligibility for compensation. The American Medical Association strongly recommends against having compensable injuries listed in legislation. The nature of vaccineinjuries militate against listing specific events and time periods for onset in statute; there are too many variables. Identification of compensable events through administrative regulations may be a more desirable alternative. Regulations are more flexible and amenable tochanges reflecting new developments in the immunization field and permit the on-going input and advice of scientific experts. In addition to the overall objection to inclusion of any specific Table in legislation, we have reviewed the Table and question the appropriateness of medical events listed and the terminology employed. The legislative format precludes necessary flexibility and application of individualized medical judgment.The rigidity of the legislative approach should be avoided. Surcharges on Vaccine Manufacturers. The bill does not address the increasing costs of vaccines.;' We are concerned thi ,.he surcharge method of financing will only accelerate the already high costs of vaccine since it adds to current costs by virtue of adoption of the new system of compensationBecause the entire population benefits from immunization, not just those immunized, a more appropriate financing system might be one that ultimately relies on general revenue funding. 1 fi 5 191 hedical Tracticnondards. S. 2117 would require the HMS Secretaryto issue regulations defining the circumstances under which coveredvaccines should not be administered, the circumstanceeender whichadministration of vaccine should be delayed beyond its usual time, andthe groups, categories, or characteristics of potential recipients ofsuch vaccine who may be at higher risk of major adverse reaction than thegeneral population.The required HHS regulations would strongly impact on medicalpractice and questions of professional judgment and liability. We objectto such standards being laid down by the Secretary of HHS.other concerns. In addition to these major concerns, questions arealso raised relating to the immunisations covered, statute oflimitations, provisions as set forth in the bill relating to compensationfor loss of earnings, and definition of \"maximum feasible potential.\"Conc;usionWe commend Senator Hawkins and yourself, Mr. Chairman, for seekingdevelopment of a means to assist children seriously injured through theadministration of mandated vaccines. While the bill would establish anew compensation system and provide coverage for injuries for which noremedy exists today, it also continues the present tort system that hasresulted in serious problems in this field. In this respect, the billwould be very costly and should be changed. Other modifications are alsodesirable in the new compensation program. For reasons contained in ourstatement we do not favor enactment of S. 2'17 without changes from itspresent form. 196 192 We urse thisCommittee to consider the recommendations of theCommission onVaccine Compensation submitted withour testimony. We believe theserecommendations could provide a framework for a beneficialsolution to the vaccine-injurycompensation problem. We would be happyto work with this Committee in developing a program accomplishing our mutual goals.Mr. Chairman,at this time Iwould be happyto answer anyquestions from the Committee. 0609p 197Tit4 193 REPORT OF AD HOC COMMISSION ON VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION* Introduction During the June 1983 Meeting of the AMA Rouse of Delegates, Board ofTrustees Report 00, 'National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program(Substitute Resolution 9, I-82),\" was adopted. In this report, the Boardrecommended the convening of a special Ad Hoc Commission \"to serve as aforum to examine all aspects of the vaccine injury compensation problemand provide recommendations for any appropriate legislative remedy.'Such a Commission vas established and members net on two separateoccasions:September 12 and November 10, 1983. Commission membershipincluded representatives from the AMA's Board of Trustees, and Councilson Legislation, Medical Service, and Scientific Affairs. Additionally,the following national organizations were represented:American Academy of Family PhysiciansAmerican Academy of PediatricsAmerican Society of Internal MedicineNational Medical AssociationAmerican Association of Public Health PhysiciansInstitute of MedicineNational Conference of State LegislaturesPharmaceutical Manufacturers AssociationUnited States Department of Health snd Human.Services' Centers for Disease ControlFour vaccine producers also were invited and sent representatives tothe Commission's meetings. These included observers as wall as expertsin pharmaceutical products liability.At its first meeting, the Commission received data and presentationson the scientific and legal environment in which vaccine producers andimmunization programs now must operate. To address the paramountconcerns in the most pressing area, Commissioners agreed to focus onstate mandated pediatric immunizations. Out of these deliberationsemerged the strong recommendation that all children receive the childhoodimmunizations recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and theAMA, with special attention to the timely administration of DTP(diphtheria, tetanus and pertuasis).The Commissioners also agreed that the societal benefits accruingfrom widespread availability of vaccines and full participation byfamilies in pediatric immunization programs warranted a reassessment ofthe issues surrounding compensation for vaccine-related injuries. Insummary, the Commission defined as its goals the following objectives: *The recommendations contained in this report represent the views ofthe Commission. The participating organizations will each make their oundeterminations with respect to official endorsement of the Commission'srecommendations. 198 194 assurance of the continued development and availability ofpediatric vaccines;assurance of continued participation of physicians andother qualified persons in administration of pediatricvaccines;assurance of appropriate vaccination of all children; andpromotion of the identification and equitable compensationof persons injured by severe reactions to pediatricvaccines.The Commission believes that these objectives will be promoted withadoption of the recommendations in this report.Scientific BackgroundThe Commission agreed that the following table fairly represents themost serious vaccine-related injuries that may arise in vaccinatedchildren or adults cantracting the disease by contact with thlge children:VACCINE RELATED INJURIESin the U.S. Permanent DamageEstimatedEstimated Annual DosesEstimatedIncidence Annual Cases Brain damage fromthe P in DTP3.2 permillion*13.5 million 43.2 Brain damage from 1 per million 3.2 18.0 million S (Known) * * **from TOPV million nearly all inunprotectedadults exposedto childrengiven (all agemedical care only)from any J 282:15b3, 1981**Current -Catch-up\" rate; projected to reduce an annual of 4million***Modern Meeicine 50:122-142 (January 1982)***1980 Annual. Summary MMwR 29 No. 54 September 1981 199 195 In the Commission's deliberations it was readily apparent that braindamage and related severe neuropathy arising from adverse reactions topertussis vaccine are now the most press..ng concern. Therefore,deliberation on various compensation alternatives revolved around ananalytical model based on the recent pertussis vaccine experience, withprojections into future years being made thereon. The Commission did notethat clinical investigations of an alterrative pertussis vaccine are inprogress, but felt the exercise would be more valid if it reflected thenature, number, and extent of injuries reported with the current vaccine. Abrief discussion about the pertussis disease and vaccine injury waspresented to the Commission and this is included in Appendix A.Public Policy ConsiderationsThe Commission received information from legal counsel regarding thehistorical development of pharmaceutical products liability standards in5oth common and statutory law. In assessing the adequacy of existing legalremedies and describing possible new ones, legislative and court imposedmodifications (fault and nofault) were evaluated. In analyzing thealternative vaccine compensation models that might be devised, theCommission noted several decision-making benchmarks: 1.whether eligibility for compensation is carefully,:lousily narrowly, defined in both clinical and legalterms; ..whether there Is a reliable and easy system todetermine whether negligence may have given rise toan injury; 3.whether the introduction of no fault\" or strictliability elements in any compensation program thatwould run counter to longestablished standards forpharmaceutical product, and services liability inthis country would reduce the likelihood ofacceptance;whether the compensation system is able to identifyand compensate injured persons without either undulypenalizing vaccine manufacturers and providers orwithout removing incentives for safe performance bythe same parties; 5.whether costs of a compensation mechanism include:payor administration, payor and claimant advocacyand adjudicatioi (including costs attributable tohandling spurious claims), medical and related.ompensatory\" care; 20 0 196 6.whether consideration is given tooffsetting expenses already covered by third partypayors;7.whether annualized costs of care and maintenance are very substantial lump 'um awards (as with manycivil judgments now)or additiveyear to year to potentially large sums.With these keyelements in mind, the Commissionproceeded in a careful examination of the theories and mechanismsby which some improvement in the existing system of vaccine injurycompensation might be undertaken,particularly as it related to mandated pediatric immunisation.Common Law Pharmaceuticals, including vaccines, are \"'inherently dangerous products\" in the lexicon of modern theories of tort liability.Such products areevaluated under a \"negligencestandard\" whenproduct related injury arises. If no negligence in productdesign, or production, handling, labeling and administration is litigation meynot prevail.Our societyhas the tremendous benefit flowing to asociety free of those diseases for which vaccines are available. Maintenance of this standard recognizes that (1) vaccines cannot be made absolutely safe for allpersons, and (2) some persons who are, in fact, injured by a vaccine withno attributable negligence maynot have a civil remedy.A description of the principlesand legal standards applicable to vaccine liability cases is set out in the Restatement, Torts 2d (1965) section 402A,comments j and k; comment It provides:Unavoidably Unsafe Products.There are someproducts which, in the presentstate of human knowledge, arequite incapable of being made safe for their intended and ordinary use.These are especially common in the field of drugs. An outstandingexample is thevaccine for the Pasteur treatment of rabies, which not uncommonlyleads to very serious and damaging consequences when it is injected.Since the disease itself invariably leads to a dreadfuldeath, both the marketingand the use ofthe vaccinmare fully justified, not withstanding the unavoidable high ,Agree ofrisk which they involve.Such a product, properly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions and warning,is not defective, nor is it unreasonablydangerous. 201I Ma. 197 ...The seller of such products, again with the qualificationthat they are properly prepared and marketed, and proper warningis given, where the situation calls for it, is not to be held tostrict liability for unfortunate consequences attending theiruse, merely because he has undertaken to supply the public withan apparently useful and desirable product, attended with aknown but apparently reasonable risk.Current Legal EnvironmentCommission representatives noted the following problems attendant oncivil litigation, above and beyond the concern that non-negligentlyinjured persons might go without remedies: (1) new theories of liability(e.g., failure to provide adequate information to obtain a valid informedconsent) are providing new avenues of recovery, thereby destabilizing thelitigation (and risk management) environment; (2) there is widespreadunhapp_ness over the extent of fees going to legal counsel, bothplaintiffs' and defendants', with the perception that the funds might bebetter directed to properly compensating claimants; (3) log jams in thecourts and delay in legal process, and damages awarded out of proportionto injury, are destabilizing the tort litigation system and detractinggenerally from its public credibility and acceptance.The Commission considered two alternative proposals for improving theexisting tort remedies:There was some agreement that consensus state-of-the-artstatements by an expert group could be influential in assistingpotential litigants both in evaluating cases and in reachingequitable settlements early, in the legal process. TheCommission considered recommending that an 'axper.. panel beconvened by the AHA and others in the private and public sectorto describe (1) the clinical parameters for identifyingvaccine-related injury, and (2) the projected care needs of theperson and his or her family based on the nature and extent ofeach injury.These recommendations were carried over into therecommendations adopted as part of a comprehensive legislativeproposal.The Commission considered recommending imposition by the courtsor by state legislatures, of strict product liability on vaccineproducers.This would, in effect, move tort remedies forvaccine-related injuries to a \"no-fault\" bare --any injvrytemporally and clinically among those known to be at%ribi:tableto the vaccine could be compensable, no shoving of negligence byplaintiffs would be required and freedom from negligence wouldnot remove liability from producers. It was noted that theultimate costs of extending plaintiffs' remedies would be borneby society through increased unit dose costs or vaccines and,quite possibly, by the further flight of marufacturers from 02 198 vaccine production. This alternative was rejected by theCommission because of questions as to whether the costpass-through could realistically accommodate the anticipatedsignificant producer cost increases that would arise fromincreased litigation and an increase in the pool of compensablepersons.It also noted that this 4ourse of action would notremove the manufacturer's liability and would not smart the goalof assuring continued vaccine availability.Legislative OptionsThe Commission considered legislative programa of vaccinecompensation that could be pursued: federal law (fault or no-fault),state law (fault or no-fault), and federal law that places affirmativeduties on the states (fault or no-fault). In addition, the Commissionconsidered the issues of whether the proposed remedy would be optional,added to the tort remedies now available through the courts, orexclusive, whereby a legislatively imposed administrative remedy wouldpreclude the customary civil litigation. Finally, the Commission focusedon the possibility of moving pediatric vaccine injury cases entirely outof the tort system by statute and moving them into a comprehensivestatutory program.Recommendations8y consensus, the Commissioners agreed that a federal legislativeprogram should be pursued for the appropriate compeniation of personsin;ured as a result of state mandated pediatric immunizations. Asterextensive debate, the following key elements were agreed upon:Exclusive vs. Optional Remedy. There is unanimous agreementthat an effective way to assure continued innovation andsupply of vaccines, their proper and timely administrationand to promote public participation, is to remove thevaccine injury cases from the existing tort system. Theproposed compensation system must be the exclusive remedy ofclaimants and not merely an alternative to remediescurrently available. The Commission recommend that thefederal government become the substituted defendant for thevaccine producers and providers in all claims allegingvaccine-related injury from pediatric immunizations (DTP.measles, mumps, polio.) 2.Fault vs. No-Fault. The Commission recommends thelegislation provide a no-fault entry to the clime reviewprocess.Should negligence on the part of the vaccineproducer or provider be discovered in the course ofadministrative or legal review, the legislation shouldprovide that the federal government can recsiver any awardgranted under the program from the negligent party. 203r_ 199 3.Scope of Cover_ age. The Commission recommends that allpersons eeriously injured as a result of required pediatricimmunizations be compensated. The proposed legislationwould cover only those pediatric immunizations required bystate lam. 4.Compensable Events. The Commission recommends that thelegislation direst the Secretary of the Department of Healthand Human Services to constitute an expert advisory.group todefine those injuries and advetsities that would bepresumptively compensable under this ptogram. TheCommission recommends that the compensable events not bedefined in the legislation, but be defined wholly by expertadvisors and be subjected to notice and comment throughFederal Register, publication before final adoption. 5.Extent of Com ensation.\u00b0 The Commission recommends thatawards include the medical and mper needed care,rehabilitation, special education sqd other strictly\"compensatory\" elements not covered nder other programs.While most Commissioners sre oppooed to inclusion of \"painand suffering\" awards, some agree that this may be anecessary element to enhance the political viability of thelegislation.All agree that any \"pain and suffering\"compensation should be strictly limited and the award shouldrun only to the injuted parry. 6.Amount of Compensation. The Commission recommends that thespecific dollar amounts to be awarded bi the Secretary bebased upon a formula or formulas developed by an advisorycommittee to the Secretary comprised of experts withexperience in this type of economic analysis. As with theadvisory recommendations on the definition of compensableevents, the Commission recommends that these formulas bepublished for review and comment before final adoption.Thera was strong sentiment in favor of the followingelements being included in the legislative language thataddresses development of formulas for damage awards:(1) structured .tettlements;(2) a .Near statement of the linits of fees going to legalcounsel;:3) a preference for regional formulas that give duecredence to appropriate socioeconomic differencesAmong regions: and 2O4, 200 (4) administrative information gathering that focusos onlocal agencies as the locus for making judgebentswithin the formulas as to the needs in individual .Cases. 7.Nature of Judic1,1 Review. The Commission recommends thatthe legislation provide that the Secretary's determinationas to eligibility for compersation and the amount of.damages shall enjoy a presi:aptioh that \"substantialevidence\" supports the fiatl judgemeut. Therefore,judicial review should be appellate in nature and notinvolve retrial of the facts.eFundingA variety of proposals have been made as to the manner for fundingfederal legislation to provide new avenues of compensation :o personsLnlured by participation in the national immunization programa.* TheCommission does not have at its disposal the extensive information andresources necessary to adequately.evaluate alternatives. It notes that aproposal to place a surcharge on each dose of vaccine administered inthis country may not be the wisest, given the Commission's goal of fullparticipation in pediatric immunization programs. The most desirablealternative might chew on trust funds coming from.general revenues,thereby giving Credence tg the societal interest in and benefits fromimmunization programy without in any way burdening the programs orbeneficiaries themse:ves.ConclusionThe Cammiasion finds tat the medical community believes it can, infact, Identify those persons who have had severe reactions to the statemandated pediatric vaccines. With less then severe, irreversiblein;uries, the causal connection that medicine can state may be lessprecise.The Commission also finds great dissatisfaction with existinglegal remedies as they pertain to injuries arising from mandated vaccines.Of all of the firmaments of medicine, vaccines offer the greatestpotential benefit co the greatest number of persons. They also, however,continue to have statistically .redictable incidence of very seriousin:ury for 1 very few persons.

The Imposednonimmunized neonate and young infant are nearly always ausceqtible, theattack rate approaching 1002.Despite prompt intervention with antibiotics, neither the coarse normorbidity of the disease is altered. (The prima value of antibiotictreatment is to reduce infectibility of the affected individual.) Themost frequent, serious complication Of pertussis is pneumonia. Thiscomplication is responsible for more than 902 of deaths in pertussisvictims under three years of age. Neurologic complications includeconvulsions and coma, sometimes with residual brain damage, due toanoxia.Rare neurologic complications may include subarachnoid orintraventricular hemorrhage, meningoencephalitis, unexplaineddegeneration of the brain cortex. Specific complications arenonreportable, so their incidence is based on small samples. The Officeof Technology Assessment of the United States Congress predicts apertussis diseaserelated risk of encephalopathy as 8-140 par 1,000(Compensation for VaccineRelated Injuries, November 1980). A shortreview of this subject is given by Prensky (Dan Med Child Neurol16:539-543. 19%),The mortality rate with today's care has been reduced to about 5 per1,300 cases of pertussis. (In 1926-1930, the fatality rate was 39.1 per1,000.)The reduction in mortali' may be attributed to various factors,including more effective management of secondary infectious and greateraccessibility to acute medical care. As recently as 1948, pertussis wasa leading cause of death in children under 14 years of age. Themortality in the most susceptible group, infants, remains very high; 722of pertussis deaths occur in children under one year of age.Pertussis -- the VaccineImmunization against pertussis uses a concentrated suspension ofkilled whole Bordetella pertussis organisms in a vehicle combined withdiphtheria and tetanus toxoids (DTP). Moderately severe reactions to thevaccine occur which may be attributed to the pertussis component. Theseinclude convulsions and hypotonic hyporesponsive episodes, each of whichoccurs with a frequency of'). per 1,750 vaccinations (Pediatrics 68:650,1981).acute encephalopathy following pertussis vaccination occurs withan estimated frequency of 1 per L10,000 vaccinations and residual damageis present 1 year later in approximately onethird of these individuals(MI 282:1595, 1981). It is estimated that approximately 30 cases ofpermanent brain damage might occur each year in the United States if therisk of encephalopathy is the same fot, each of the five doses in a DTPseries. 207 203 APPENDIX B Elements of Vaccine Compensation. Program'Endorsed by the Commission 1.There would ha established within the U.S. Department,of Health andHuman Services (HHS) en expert vaccine compensation advisory panel.ti 2.HHS, after mgndated consultation with the expert panel, would berequired to establish administratively a list of compensable vaccineinjuring and clinical criteria for their documentation asvaccine-associated.3. 'Eligible parties .(a defined in the statute) would file a claim withthe Department of HHS.HHS professional staff would review claims pursuant to standardsestablished and determine whether the claimant vas injured, whetherthe injury or disability is within the class of designatedcompensable,injuries, and whether it is vaccine-associated. HHSwould have the power of subpoena, examination of the claimant, etc.,at its discretion. Claimant would have the right to usualadministrative appeal from denial of a claim. 5.Recovery would be limited to economic losses including medicalexpenses, costs of medical and vocational rehabilitationage loss,and any other out-of-pocket losse not compensated by other programs. 6.Once HHS staff had determined that a claimant had a compensableinjury, the amount of the award would be determined pursuant to acompensation plan established administratively by HHS on advice ofan expert advisory panel. Amounts in dispute would be dealt withwithin the appeal process. ..Structured settlements (i.e., payments to be paid over time on aschedule) would be utilized in cases of injury / disability expectedto last more than two years. 8.The vaccine compensation program would be an exclusive remedy: allclaims for vaccine - associated injury or disability would be madeonly under the program. 9.When filing a claim for compensation by the government, there wouldbe no need for the claimant to allege or prove fault. Furthermore,the climant would not be permitted to pursue a tort action. 208 204 10.The federal government would have the right to bring an actionagainst a program participant (i.e., vaccine manufacturer or healthprofessional administering the vaccine) to recover amounts paid toclaimants and associated expenses resulting from negligent acts oromissions. 11.Except for being subject to suit by the government (f10 above), allindividuals involved in the manufacture, distribution, andadministration of government designated vaccines would be immunefrom any legal action by vaccinaes or their representatives forinjuries and diaabilities covered by the RHS program. 12.If a claimant's claim is denied, or the amount awarded is disputed,the claimant may appeal the decision to a federal court afterexhausting administrative remedies. The Secretary would enjoy apresumption that substantial evidence supported her decision lreview would not be de novo but limited to a review as to whetherHHS had properly interpreted and fulfilled its statutoryobligations. 209 205 VACCINE COMPENSATION WESTIN Vaccine Injury Claim 1BEE AdmielstrativeReview of Claim Approved Clain Determination of Area',by EBB Panel Award Accepted Award inDisput:j yDenied Claia Administrative Appeal Recovery 18 454 08414Judicial Appeal 1 Denial of Appeal 2 I 206Senator HAWKINS.

INC. 2.12 208 I.INTRODUC1 ION AND SUMMARY Millions of children are immunized each year against such dia,7.anes astetanus,diphtheria.pertusais.pol.) and others.These immunisationprograms protectsocietyfrom disease epidemics and thus save manychildren and adults from death and disability. However, these mandatoryimmunization programs are not without costs. Each year a small fractionof children have severe reactions to vaccines that result in permanentdisability and in some cases even death. Supported by the efforts of the American Academy of Pediatrics andDissatisfiedParents Together, agroup of parents ofvaccine injuredchildren,Senator Hawkins has submitted abillto Congress (S.2117)whichwouldcompensalevictimsofadversevaccinereactions.Thepurpose of this report is to estimate the potential costs of this bill. To eveliteulthepotentialcostsof thelegislation,this analysisexamines the following: Cost of compensation per case,Total cost of compensation over time,Awards in the tort system, andPotential impact on the Federal budget.(qualitatively)Inadditiontocompensating victims of vaccine injuries,the proposedlegislation would provide funds for research. However, this report duesnot attempt to analyze tho;-,e costs. 213 209 There la some uncertainty regarding the life expectancy of thesevictims.Since life expectancy has a large impact on the expected cost ofcompensation,wehaveestimatedcostsundertwolifeexpectancySee73 years (base case), ando40 years. Thisaralys4sestimatesthatthebasecaseaveragecostofcompensation per casewill be about $230,000 and the 40 year scenariocost per case will be about $166,000. These estimates include legal feesof 20 percent but excludes administrative overhead which would probablyadd an additional 5 percent to the cost of the bill. Reimbursement forforegorn earnings is by far the largest component of cost, comprising 62percent of the base case average cost per case and 54 percent of the40 year scenario cost per case.The total cost of the program in future years will depend on theform of payment.The bill allows the claimant to choose from among threepayment forms:two lump sum payment options and an option whichreimburses expenses as they are incurred. Victims will also have theoption of choosing either the tort system or the legislativeprogram.However, for the purposes of this analysis, we assume that all victimschoose thelegislative system.Assuming a 73 year life expectancy, ifpatients are reimbursed for actual expenses as they are incurred, thepayments for the entire program will be close to $86 million per year thethe first two years, then drop to $31 million per year in the third yearand increase toa steadystatecostof $64million per year bythoseventy-third year of the program. if patients opt for either of the twolumpsumtypepayment options,initialcostswill be significantlyhigher -- over $200 million ineachofthe first years.However, 214 210 steadystate costs would be $45 million,lower than under an actualreimbursement scenario.Therefore, decision makers looking only at thefirst thirty years of the program would prefer to compensate victims ascosts are incurred because it is cheaper than lump sum compensationin the beginning.However, from a steady state annual cost perspective,either of the lump sum options would be preferred.If life expectancy is 40 years, annual costs will not only be lowerunder allcubes, but the differences between the options will, be less.Costs for both cases in the first three years and at steady 'state areshown in Exhibit 1,The steady state costs assume that incidence will beconstant over time.Actually research in this area is likely to reduce therisk of the vaccine thereby reducing incidence and annual compensationcosts.The cost of the program in the first two years is quite large relativeto estimated revenues from the sale of ves.eines. Using the base caseassumptions the cost could range from two-and-a-half times annual salesrevenues in the actual reimbursement scenario to almost six 'times annualrevenues in the lump sum scenario. This could put a substantial initialburden on manufacturers and the Federal government.As the major purchaser of vaccine, the Federal government would beaffected by any changes in the price of the vaccine. itis diffilult toestimate how the legislation willaffect vaccine prices and therefore theFederal budget because itisuncertain how the costs of compensationunder the legislationwill differ from the costs of compensation throughtort awards.flelative ousts under the two systems depends on a variety of factorsincludinv,thepropen,.ity of people to 111e claims under each system, the 215 211 Exhibit 1 TOTAL COST OF PROGRAM$) Pant 0 tionYear 1Year 2Year 3Steady 39,6Lump Sum 165.9165.9 34.2 34.2Ten Year 140.4149.4 17.8 34.2 216 212 average compensation awl range of compensation under each system, andthe number of people whu would still choose the tort system if a legisla-tive alternative were available.

To simplify the task of estimating thepotentialcostofthisbill,P1113developedthe framework showninExhibit 2.Reactions to childhood vaccines can range from mild -- a sorearm or one or two days of fever, to severe -- ending in permanentdisability or death.The billwould notcompensate mostmildcasesbecause the minimum compensation limit is $2,500. AAP has estimated that.03 percent of vaccinated children would have a mild reaction that wouldrequire short term hospitalization costing roughly $2,500. We use theseestimates, and In addition, we rely on three illness categories -- Acute,Chronic, and Death -- torepresent the wide rangs of more seriouspossible reactions.Cases in each illness category will receive differentcompensation components.The compensation components are listed foreach illness categoryinExhibit 2.Compensation canbeclaimed in anyone of three forms, as depicted by the diagram in Exhibit 2. Indefiningillnesscategoriesandestimatingthemedicalandrehabilitation costs associated with them, P1113 relied on work done by theOffice ofTechnology Assessment (OTA) and the National Center forHealthServicesResearch (NCHSR) of NHS.

Six separate compensation components can be identified from theproposed legislation: Medical Expenses - Reimbursement of all past and actualor anticipated future out of pocket medical costs.Rehabilitation, Special Education, /tome Care and OtherContinuingServices-Reimbursementofanyother necessary facilities or care.PainandSuffering-Compensationnottoexceed $100,000 for the victim only not the family.Earnings Loss-Compensation for anticipated loss of earnings due to disability.Survivor BenefitsCompensation to the parents of avictim in the event of vaccine related death,Legal Feestip to 20-25 percent of total compensation. As Exhibit2shows,notallvictimswillreceive compensation for allcomponents. Cases in the Acute category ^.re characterized by collapse requiringshout a week of hospitalization but resulting in complete recovery. Thus,medical expenses are assumed to occur only in thefirst year and norehabilitation or special care costs would be incurred. Medical costs are'.!.sed on the NCliSR profile \"moderate encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, characterized by collapse andresulting in complete recovery.\" Compensation for pain and suffering is X20 216 limited in the bill. to $100,000. Since this component would probaby bemuch less for patients in the Acute category, our analysis assumes anaverage pain and suffering benefit of $10,000 per case although this mayeven be high,Earnings loss compensation is not applicable in the Acutescenario becausethevictim'seventualabilitytoworkwillnotbeimpaired.Survivor benefits also are not applicable because the vaccinedoes not result in death.Legal fees up to 20 percent of total compensa-tion are allowed by the hill if the claim is granted initially, and fees upto 25 percent are allowed if the case is appealed or reviewed.Thisanalysis assumes compensable legal fees are an additional 20 percent sfcompensation.* IllnessesintheChroniccategorywouldresultinlongtermdisability, such as brain damage, which would require long term medicaland therapeutic care and could prevent or limit ..the victim from enteringthe work force.Compensation for victims in this category could includereimbursement for long term medical care as well as special education,therapy, and domiciliary care throughout adult life.Cost estimates forthese components are based on the NCIISR profile of \"severe encephalitisand encephalomyelitis due to the DTP vaccine resulting in psychomotorretardation.\"Compensationfor pain and suffering is assumed to be$25,000 per case in this analysis although this may be low.In additionto these costs, victims in the Chronic 'category would be compensated forforegone earnings.This analysis assumes that the patient would receivethe equivalent $18,200** annually between the ages of 18 and 65.Legalcosts are assumed to be 20 percent of total compensation. Soule interested parties expect legal fees to be close to 10 or 15percent.$18,200 was the average manufacturing wage; in 1983. 217 Rarely,reactiontoan immunization can end in death. In thesecases, we assume the child dies within 24 hours of the immunization, andthus assume no medical expenses are incurred. The bill does provide abenefittotheparentsofthe deceased child of between $300,000 and$700,000.This analysis assumes $500,000 per case. Legal costs areagain assumed to be an additional 20 percent. The estimates for each coat component as described Above permit usto 4Ievelop a cost per case for each illness category. in addition, weassume that the very short hospitalization cases are compensated $2,500per case.In order to estimate the total cost of the bill in its first yearand over time, assumptions in the following areas are also necessary: Payment schedule.Annual incidence by illness category.Number of claims for cases that occurred prior to theenactment of the bill.The Hill offers the three payment options listed in Exhibit 2: \"Lump Sum Option\" - A lump sum payment to cover ell past and future projected expenses.\"Actual Reimbursement Option\" - An initial lump sum payment to cover all prior expenses plus reimbursementof future expenses as they are incurred.\"Ten Year Option\"An'.nitial lump sum payment tocover prior expenses plus projected expenses for fivetotestears with the right to a final determination asto remaining lifetime payments at the end of that five toten year period.(This analysis assumes a ten yearperiod. ) By definition, the expected net present value (NM/ ) per case will bethesameunder each4eettario.Thisisbecausecosts in the Actual 222 218 Reimbursement Option are equal to expectedcostsinthe other twooptions.Annual payments over limo, however, can differ significantly asthe results in Section 3 show.Annual incidence by illness category ace based on incidence ratesfrom OTA (and AAP for the short term category) and estimates of 1984dosages from the Congressional Budget Office (C110).These are showninExhibit3A.The billalso allows Any existing cases to file claimsduring the first two years of the program. The number of retroactiveclaims is baseu on estimates of average annual incidence over the lasttwenty yours.We use CBO's estimates of past incidence and assume that50 percent of cases in the Chronic and Death categories will file claimsduring the first two years of the program. It has been argued thatpropensity to claim will be even loss than 50 percent due to lack ofawareness of the disease's causation and lack of proof.Since Acute casesare limited in no severe long-term effects, we assumethatnopastAcuteclaimswillbefiled.Exhibit 3Rshows thoseassumptions.

As would beexpected, cost per case is highest in the Chronic category: $722,000 inpresent value terms.Total compensation costs for parents of childrenwho die from the vaccine is $600,000.Compensating Acute cases issignificantly less expensive, costing $16,000 per case. Since the majorityof cases fall into the Acute category (almost 70%), the weighted averagecoat per case excluding the short stay cases (shown in the last column ofExhibit 3)is$231,000,significantlylessthantheChronic or Deathcategory costs.If we were to include the mild short stay cases costing$2,500 per case,the weighted average cost per case would only be$16,000.The last column in Exhibit 4 and the bar chart in Exhibit 5 show therelative magnitude of each cost component in the bill.

Itis difficult to draw any conclusions regarding average tort awards fromsuch a small sample of oases, particularly tlinee the range is so large.However, if these crises are representative, compensation costs under thetort system are likely to be higher than our estimated average $231,000per case under the bill.With the exception perhaps of the Larson v. EliLillycase ($150,000), however,all of these cases would fitinto ourChronic category.Thus, the more appropriate comparison would be withchronic cases which would, using our assumptions, receive compensationof about $000,000 before legal fees under 5.2117. Since attorney fees arelikelytobe greater and more variable under the tort system, itisdifficultto predict whether average cost per case for chronically illpatients will be higher under the tort or legislative system. Ncverthe-less,itis safe to saythat individual compensation could reach muchhigher levels in a tort award or settlement than through legislation. IVCONCLUSIONSThis section reviews and discusses the results of the analysis and.briefly outlines possible implications of the bill in four areas: cost percase,total cost over time under each payment scenario, cost relative tothe tort system, and potential impact on the Federal budget. This would particularly be the case if litigation were to result/ inpunitive damages, which would not be allowed under the legislativecompensation option.A recent case suggests that punitive damagesmaybeavailablefor DPT (Morris v.Parke, 10 yrs$413,000/ life 301:Rel-..Juff rev Esquire, Verdict CashSettlement 8TORT COMPENSATION(Continued) Award Case Comment5,Anon.

Replacement of lost earnings is the largest component of this coat.We have assumed thatallvictims of Chronic diseases will receive 100percent of the average manufacturing wage throughout their wage-earningyears (18 to 65) and that this wage stays constant In real terms. Othervictimcompensationbillsthatcompensateclaimantsforlostincome*provide only a fraction of lost wages: usually 67 to 80 percent of eitheractual lostincome or an av rage wuge. The expected cost of SenatorHawkins'billwould he reducedif\"thegenerally recognized actuarialprinciples and projections\"referred to in thebillwere interpreted toinclude. n wage recovery factor of leas than 100 percent. In addition toreducing the earnings component of the bill, this would reduce allowableattorney's fees, which are a flat percentage of total compensation and arethe second largest single cost component. Survivor benefits are large relative to other costs on an actual easebasis; (compare $500,000 for those in the Death eutegory to lost earningsbenefits for Chrcnic patients of $505,000). Survivor benefits do not haveas large an impact on the weighted average cost per case or on the totalcost of the bill, however,because the number of people receiving thosebenefits hi 236 232 Total Cost Over TimeThis analysis focuses on the cost of compensating victims.Hence,weignoreothercostsoftheNationalChildhoodVaccine- InjuryCompensation Act such as the broad -based study of risks associated withthevaccines covered by the bill. Exhibit 6shows the estimated pattern ofcashflows over time.Assuming incidence remains constant over time, costs will reach a steadystate bytheseventy-thirdyear of the program for the actual costscenario end much earlier for the other two scenarios. -Annual costsunder the lump-sum scenario start off very high in the first two yearswhen retroactive cases are allowed to file claims. The annual cost of5231 millioninthefirsttwoyearsisfivetimesgreaterthanthesteady-state annual cost of $45 million. Under this scenario, steady stateis reached in the third year of the program assuming incidence remainsconstant over time.Under the ten-year option, annual costs in the first two years arefour an a half times greater than steady-state annual costs. In the thirdyear, new cases receive compensation for the expected present value ofCosts for the next ten years only, so annual costs are at less than stead)state.In the tenth year, the initial claimants receive compensation for allfuture expenses and the cost remains constant at 345 millionper year aslong asthe incidence rate remains the same.The pattern of actualreimbursement optioncashflow startsoffhighinthe first two years, although not as high as the lump-sum or ten-yearoptions, then drops significantly in year three when the retroactive casescan no longerfile.Annual costs increase gradually through year 18. 237 233 During this period, new claimants are tickled to the compensation pooleach year, yet none receive earnings reimbursement (although, we assumethat all retroactive cases do). in year 19, we assume that all claimantswho filed in the first year begin receiving earnings loss compensation andthe growth rate in annual cost increases. By the thirty-second year,annualcostsfortheactualcost option are greater than annual costsunder the other two options.In the sixty-third year, we assume thatthe pool of retroactive claimants dies, reducing annual costs.This is asi4144+11.r assumption;in actuality, deaths of these patients would bespread over A longer period and the drop in annual cost would not be asdramatic.The rate of increase in annual cost is slower from year 65 toyear 73 as the first claimants reach retirement ago and stop receivingearnings loss compensation. We nssume that all claimants have a normal73-year life expectancy, so at year 73, when the first group of claimantsincidence equals death rate and the cost of the bill reaches steadystate. Clearly, while the present value cost per case of each option is thesame, the annual cash flows over time are very different. Under thelump-sum and ten-year options, the initial costs are extremely high butthe steady state annual costs are only 70 percent of the steady statecosts under the actual cost scenario. A decision-maker looking at costsfor the first 30 years of the program would clearly opt for the actual costoption.On the other hand, decision-makers reevaluating the system 30years later would wish the initial decision- maker had selected either thelump-sum or ten-year option. Focusing on the impact of the bill's coat today, the lump-sum optionwould impose a substantial burden on manufacturers and purchasers ofthe vaccine if a surcharge were imposed to fund the entire $231 million.Who bears the largest part of this cost depends on how the costs can be X38 234 passed from manufacturers to purchasers through priceincreases. Thiscost h the find two yearsis almost six tines the annual revenues ofvaccinenumufacturerfs.The annual cost of $205million in the nest twoyears under the ten-yearoption is over five timesannual revenues.Theburden of these non-recurring costs could he softened byspreading thecost out over time with a financing mechanism.Por example, the billpermits the fund to borrowagainst the Federal treasuryand to repay thedebt with interest.An additional problem withthe high initial cost isthat assessing; an appropriate surcharge rate will be difficult. Initialcostsundertheactualcostalternative imposeasmallerburden on the fund.The annual costof $86 millioninthefirsttwoyears is lust over twotimes annual vaccine revenues. The steady stateiinnuttlcost under the actual costoption, however, is 1.6 times currentannual revenues compared tothe steady state costunder the other twooptions, which is just slightly more than current annual revenues. Comparison With Tort CostsIt is difficult to compare coats of legislative compensation to costs inthe tort system for two reasons:First. the limited availahle data on tort awards and thewide range of compensation reportedinthefewcasesavailable make cost-per-case comparisons speculative. Actually, we do not have precise information on annual revenuesfrom vaccine sales.However, knowing that theCenter for DiseaseControl went approximately $13 million in 1982 and comprised about(me third of the market, we estimate thattotalsales were about$39 million.Th; does not include[)'CI'. 239 235 Second,the number of victims who might make claimsis unknown but probably will not be the same under eachalternative.Littleempiricaldataisavailableto make assumptions regardingpropensity to claim under a legislative versus legal system. However, itis interesting to note that claims for automobile accident in ,ies increased60 percent when no-faultautomobile insurance wentinto effect.Thisstatisticseemsusefulifwe viewalegislative system as a no-faultalternative to the tort. system. Therefore, even ifthe average cost percase in the legislative system is less than in the tort system, total costsof the legislative system could exceed the tort system because propensityto claim is higher. Anadditionalpointtonote isthatthebillasitIscurrentlyproposedisnotanexclusive remedy for victimsof vaccine injury.Victims may choose either the administrative route orlitigation.Thus,those potential claimants who expect an award in the tort system that ishigher than the hill's compensation (after subtracting transaction costs)could still resort to the tort system. Of course. 'actors other than the expected value of an award affecta clnimants' decision-making, such as the higher probability of receivingbenefits,the speed at which compensation occurs and the magnitude oflegal expenses (particularly iffeesmust be paid up front).Clearly,under a legislative system compensation is more certain, the process isnot es lengthy and involvedas litigation and legal fees are likely tobelower. Impact on the Federal Budget Theinformationcurrentlyavailabledoesnotallowprecisequantificationofthe impact ofthe proposed legislation onthe Federal 2 4 236 budget.However, we can qualitatively evaluate the potential costs of thebill by examining the costa the Federal government currently bearsRSaresult of vaccine-related injuries and estimating how these costs mightchange as a result of legislation. Costa Currently Borne TheFederalgovernment currentlyincurscompensationcosts in two ways:As a purchaser of vaccines, andAs a provider of social programs.As a major purchaser of vaccines, it bears some indeterminate portion ofthe tort rind liability insurance costs manufacturers 'pay and pass on topurchasers through increased product prices. Over the past five years,Federal agencicb have bought more than 311 percent of the net doses ofmanyofthemostcommonly usedimmunizationvaccinesthatweredistributed.No data isavailable on what portion of the price theFederal government. paidfor vaccines covers compensation claim costs.Moreover, itis not clear how the recent high tort settlements, verdictsslid expected future claims will affect insurance costa andvaccine prices. Includes onlymeasles,rubella,measles/rubella,RUH. oralPolio,mumps, and inactive polio vaccines. 2.11 237 One small manufacturer of DTP vaccine claims the reason itraised its wholesale price in May 1983 from $3.89 to $35.00 per 7.5 ml vialwas to cover increased liability exposure. This would suggest that atleast 89 percent of its current selling price resulted from compensationcosts.However, this could be an isolated case as other manufacturershave not followed suit with similar price increases. In fact, over thepast too years, prices for major vaccines paid by Federal agencies haveIncreased, on average, between 6.9 and 25.0 percent per year, with atypical increase in the 8.7 to 13.5 percent range. these increases arenotsubstantially higher than the rate of inflation, indicating that therecent costlytortsettlements haveyettoradicallyincrease productprices for most manufacturers. The second way in which the Federal government currentlypays vaccine-injury related costs is through various entitlement and socialprograms such as Medicaid, .SSI, maternal and child health block grants,andtheF:dueattonFor AllHandicapped ChildrenAct.The primarybeneficiariesarechildrenof disadvantagedfamilies.No figuresareavailable to determine how much these programs pay to cover expensesfor immunization victims. Potentia' Costs ifLegislation is PassedIfthe proposedbillispassed,the Federal governmentwould see its eurrent obligations for compensating immunization victimschange in three ways: The cost of the vaccine is likely to change.The burden on social programs will probably fall, and 38-454 0 - 84 - 16 2 .4 2 238 A new liability will probably be incurred to underwritedeficits of the fund. The costimpact on the government as a purchaser ofvaccineswill depend on how the legislation affects the price of theproduct.tinder the legislation, compensation costs will be funded by nsurchargeonmanufacturersofvaccines.Totheextentthatmanufacturers increase or decreer the price of the vaccine in responseto this surcharge relative to the price under the tort system, the Federalgovernmentwillhe affected indirectly because, for many vaccines,itbuys almostone-thirdof the net mount thatisdistributed.Itindifficult to predict which direction product prices will move, particularlysince minimal informationisavailable regarding vaccine manufacturers'expectations ono actions on tort costs. The variables that will have themajor impact on prices are: The propensity of people to claim under each systemThe average compensation cost and the range of costaunder each system, andThe numberofpeople who ,youldchoosethetort alternative if the bill were passed. As mentioned earlier, more people are likely to claim undertilegislative system because the harriers to making claims, such as highup front costs and long legal preemies, are reduced or eliminated. Thisisparticularlytrueforvictimsinthe shorthospitalizationorAcutecategories who would probably not file tort suits due to high transactioncosts and low expected awards but would be qualified to make a claimunderthehill.Thisfactorwouldtendtomake costsunder thelegislation greater than cost.; under a tort system. 213 239 The average compensation per ease under the fund islikely to he less than the average tort award. This factor would tend tomake costs under the bill less than under a tort system, all other thingsbeing equal.Since the bill does not remove a victim's light to sue, hightortawardswouldnotbeeliminatedunderthelegislativescheme.However, the number of people who would file tort suits would probablydecline iflegislative alternative were available, Clearly,these factors can have different effects on thecostof the legislative system relative to the tort system.If the netresultisthat the surcharge plus the cost of residual litigation is lessthan the cost manufacturers would expect from litigation in the absence ofproduct prices would decline with the enactment of the bill.However, since propensityto claim islikely to increase andsince thelegislation preserves the option of victims to sue, it is more likely thatproduct costs and, therefore, Federal expenditures would increase withthe enactment of legislation.The second way thattheFederal government might befifferentially impneti'd is through its social programs. To the extent thatvictims choose the legislative route, the vuceine- injury costs, suet, asint:diva!,education, and training expenses for immunization victims, thatpref.cntly are p:dd by entitlement and social programs, will be shifted tothe compensation fund, reducing the burden on Feder/11 programs. Inaddition, the incentive to enter the welfare roles because of high medicalcosts would be eliminated for victims who choose that fund. !fence, suchincome supportstofamilieswould no longer he paid by theFederalgovernment. 4 ,1 240 The third way inwhich the Federal budget would beaffected by thelegislationin through loansto the fund.Thebillauthorizes the fund to borrow, with interest, from the Federal Treasuryifitruns out of money.Therefore, there could be a short-term cashdrain on the Treasury that would be paid back in future years, If largenumbers of parents elect to take lump-sum payments, the cash deficit thatwould need to he covered by the Treasury is potentially quite large: atotal of $462 million inthe/ first two years,This would be leas ($171million in the first two years) if people tended to choose the actual costreimbursement option. 215 0 C.FstimntectCosts of Selected Medical Events Knownotted to he Related ko the_ Administration of Common Vaccines,DepartmentofHealthNitication and Welfare,PublicHealthService.Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, National Center for HealthServices Research.

Exhibit C.1 tabulates the cost per case bydisease category,These costs can be compared to those for a 73 yearlife in Exhibit 4in the text.If patients actually live en average of 40years, the net present value cost of compensation for chronic patients is$494,000, about two-thirds of the base case costs. Exhibit C.2 shows thecost components per Case. As Exhibit C.3 shows, costs over time would also be lower and thedifference between steadystate costsinthe three options would behmaller.Steady state costs are more similar because the costs for mild,acute and death cases which are common among all options, are a largerproportion of total annual cost. This graph can be compared to Exhibit 6in the text for a 73 year life expectancy. 2 5 Exhibit C.1COSTS PER CASE BY ILLNESS CATEGORY (40 YEAR LIFE)(Constant Calculated by annualizing the NCHSR's present value of coats excluding year 1.

I believe you said that your study shows thecost would be about one quarter or maybe even less than that, be-cause CBO's figures are costed on 100 percent of every case?Dr. SMITH. We are not sure how CBO's figures were developed.We have no information of the details of their development.Ours are based on 100 percent of the cases being covered by thesystem. Nevertheless, there is a tremendous difference in the costestimate. Ours runs really less than one-fourth.We estimate that in the first 2 years the program can be admin-stered for about $150 million. After the first 2 years, that you reach a steady state of annual cost of approximately $50 million.These figures can be changed to some extent up or down depend-. ink; on the variables that exist in the entire programsuch thingsas how the payment options are designed, whether or not they aresettled in a lump sum fashion or whether it is spaced over theyears. It depends on the life span, the best estimate that you canarrive at of the life span of a seriously injured individual. The esti-mate bases the cost for that seriously injured individual at 73years, a full, normal life span. We doubt that this occurs. We thinkit is more likely on the order of 40 years.It depends on the number of cases grandfathered in at the outsetof the program, and it depends, further, of course, on the numberof people who finally choose the compensation system. All of theseare variables that can determine a great deal of the differences incost.Senator HAWKINS. We appreciate your working with us on thebill, Dr. Smith. Itis my understanding that when we received acopy of your estimate of the cost from your experts and provided itto CBO, CBO wanted to go back to the drawing board and lookagain at their costs. Hopefully, your study will lower those costs.Do you feel it is necessary to provide a table of injuries in thebill?Dr. SMITH. We feel that, in one way or another, one place or an-other, there has to be finally and ultimately a table of injuries.One of the concerns that we have always had expressed aboutthis concept from the beginning has been the numbers of instancesthat could be classed as temporally associated eventsevents thatthey might occur around the time of an immunization and theymight not be possible to distinguish from a reaction to the immuni-zation either clinically or pathologically.This table of events, the table of injuries, with associated timesconnected with them, is an effort to sift out those instances or tem-porally associated events, as many as possible. It will not be per-fect, butitwill sift out the majority of the temporally associatedevents.The advantage of incorporating it into the legislation is that itdoes put it in place immediately and allows the program to startsooner. rather than going through the process of rulemaking, regu-lation formation, and so on. which would take a couple of years.We feel teat there is stmw advantage in having it in the legisla-tion. There is incorporated in the legislation opportunity for alter-ations of the table with additional time and experience.Senator HAWKINS. Are you concerned with the supply of vaccine?2d0 236Dr. SMITH_ Terribly concerned. That has been one of our greatestconcerns from the very beginning, as we have seen the number of vaccine producers shrink and, of course, as we have seen the costsmore recently escalate.I have heard various descriptions of the stockpile. One that Ihave heard has been fi weeks. Now that is not a very adequate safe-guard for our supply if someone suddenly decides to leave the mar-ketplace.Senator HAwKiNs. Thank you so much, Dr. Smith.Dr. King, we appreciate your joining us today. I know the FloridaLegislature is in session, considering a number of imirtant healthbills, and that you should be there to help them.Dr. KING. That is correct.Senator HAWKINS. I appreciate your taking the time.You mentioned ASTHO's concern about the cost of the bill andits relationship to a State's ability to purchase vaccines for distri-bution among its public health clinics.Dr. KING. That is correct. I think that one of the difficulties forthe States, those folks in the public health agencies in the States,in dealing with this issue is to sort out what we are trying to dowith the bill and the impact that is going to have on the day-to-dayadministration of the program. I think that is where a lot of theconcern that you hear is coming from.Inevitably, what we are trying to do here today is going to meanthat the immunization program in this country is going to be muchmore expensive. We have heard dollars and, even within the margin of error of the dollars that you are talking about, you aretalking about a great expense. It will not be just a Federal expense,a U.S. expense; it will be a State expense. too.Even without that, the cost of vaccines is rising so rapidly thatboth those that we purchase through the centers and those that wepurchast,hrough our own State purchasing contracts are gettingquite a bit higher.I am not mistaken, I appeared before you on a committee hear-ing last fall in which we discussed the same issue then, and it is avery real problem and we are all quite concerned about it. The cost of the administration of the program I think is some-thing that can be dealt with, and I think that is something the ad- ministration people who are in the administration can concernthemselves about with any new idea.However, one of the things which has been barely touched on,which is critically important to this bill and to what it is trying todo, is the information it generates. The real progress is made in theelimination of the disease in our society with technically valid in-formation. It has happened throughout the years, and it continuesto he the case now.We do nut haveat least in car State- -the kind of informationthat wt' would like to have that tells us really what do we have outthere in the way of vaccine-related injuries. We have some idea in 'et tors Some utilities are better than others in reporting.11w private medical community is Unproving daily. However, if youwere to ask nw today exactly how nniny vaccine-related injuries have there been and will there be in the State of Florida. I couldnot tell you that. and I need to know that I need to know that, and 257 Ithink every State health office in the country needs to Itaow. Ithink the Center desperately needs to know that. We are workingvery hard on getting in that direction now. We are improvingdaily.That is why when the two concepts come togetherthe conceptitnd need for compensation, which is real; we have a societal obliga-tionon the other hand, what is the nature of the problem really?It is hard to know how big the problem is, exactly what the rela-tionship is to what we are doing on a day-to-day basis. Hopefully,we can help iron that out.Senator HAWKINS. Florida is a gateway State because of our geo-graphic location.Dr.KING.That is correct.SenatorHAWKINS.We are the entry point for refugees, immi-gants, visitors from nations--Dr. KING. And college students from the North, too. [Laughter.]SenatorHAWKINS. Iwas getting to that. [Laughter.]And from other countries that do not have active immunizationprogramsDr.KING.That is correct.SenatorHAWKINS.Does this make Florida at risk of epidemics?Dr.KING.Yes, Madam Chairman, it does.We had in 1982, although our total numbers of cases for the yearwere down from the year before, we still had far too many cases inthe State, and they were almost all,. as far as I can tell, directlyrelated to the importation from South America and the rest of theworld of a new case of measles. It proved particularly difficult be-cause the population at. risk at that point in time, at greatest risk,was the middle school population, although we did have some sec-ondary spread to the younger children. We are constantly on ourguard. and we have had a number of counties which have had to gothroughtrfairly major school exclusion process in which everychild in a school or in an entire school system, if it is already intothe secondary generation of cases and spread beyond the firstschools. had to be removed from school for a period of several daysto a couple of weeks to get the immunization status up to tha point.that we can afford to let the children back in to keep the spread oftlw disease down. That continues to be a very real problem.The encouraging thing, I believe, however, is that measles is oneof these diseases like smallpox in which the only reservoir, as faras we know. is the human reservoir and potentially it is eradicable.Ithink itis so important at 0 is point in time that we do nothesitate (m the brink of our success. I think within our lifetimes wemay well see what we have seen with smallpox, and what we needter do is to push ahead if we can.Rut. yes, we do have a problem in Florida because of that.Senator } lAWKINS Is the Florida Legislature proposing any man-:Lour', reporting tor reaction to pert ussis?DrKiNi;No.I am not aware of any legislation in the Stateor the house at the present time for reporting.

I am not aware of a specific bill in the Florida Legislature atthis point on that issue.Senator HAWKINS. Can States do it administratively without leg-islation?Dr. KING. Yes. Oh, yes, and we intend to.Senator HAWKINS. Do you know how many States have donethis?I)r. KING. No, I am not aware. I am sorry.Senator HAWKINS. We appreciate your cooperation. We look for-ward to working with you on this legislation as it develops.Dr. Nelson, AMA, one of the proposals that you considered wasto convene an expert panel that would define the clinical param-eters for identifying vaccine-related injuries and the projected care,needs, of the injured individual. How do.you view the use of suchan expert panel?Dr. NELSON. This was also one of the recommendations in thereport of the National Immunization Work Group that was com-missioned by HEW in 1977. We felt that, given the alternatives for.defining eligibility and compensable events, having an expert panelconvened and identify the compensable events for proposed rule-making was a more desirable alternative than to have some listingof adverse reactions and eligibility criteria as part of the bill itself.I think:it should not be difficult for the Secretary to identify agroup of experts that are recognized nationally in their field anduse them as a resource in developing proposed rules.Senator HAWKINS. The Department of HHS has a very strong po-sition regarding immunizations, however. I understand the Secre-tary has termed failure to immunize a child a form of child abuse.In your mind, doesn't that impose a conflict of interest for the Sec-retary to say that if a child is not immunized, that is child abuseand at the same time having to be involved in the appointment ofa panel and also be involved in compensation?Dr. NELSON. Well, I think you would have to ask the Secretarywhether that represented some inconsistency. I have confidence inthe ability of the Secretary to carry out the mandates of a bill thatwould call for him convening a special panel to assist in definingeligibility.Senator HAWKINS. Should the Secretary be involved in determin-ing eligibility compensation?Dr. Nisox. I suppose that he would insofar asSenator HAWKINS. It is a \"she\" right now.Dr. NELSON. Pardon me, he or she would insofar as being respon-sible for the publication of the proposed rules.Senator HAWKINS. Thank you.I)r. Salk, itis a pleasure to have you with us. Your work hasearned you justifiable renown and saved countless lives. I remem-ber as a young girl the panic of the polio epidemicclosed swim -ruing pools, closed theaters, and the fear we lived in, especially in263 259the South. I can remember the relief, also, when a vaccine for polio was developed.Your testimony poses a very interesting question. How can we structure a compensation program which encourages the use of thesafest of all available vaccines?Dr. SALK. I think it is a n'ter of incentive and it is a matter ofpenalty. The question is, Vi:.0 it to provide the incentive and whois to provide the penalty? In the case of vaccine-associated injuries,itis clear that it would be far more desirable to avoid them, farmore desirable to have vaccines that do not require the use of com-pensation as remedy. In the event that compensation is necessary. it seems to me that the kind of legislation that you are proposing would be desirable. A careful distinction must be made betweenthose instances in which there is no other remedy and those inwhich there is.It seems to me that in this instance, where alternative vaccinesexist as is the case of poliovirus vaccine, that the indemnificationfor such damages should not he included in the bill inasmuch as the evidence is now clear that there is a polio vaccine that can be administered effectively without inducing injury, and there is one that does induce injury in a small number of instances. My sugges- tion would he that for instances in which there is no such an alter- nativethatindemnification measures are required. However, where a safe alternative exists then indemnification as a solution should not be available.Senator HAWKINS. Do you think the Federal Government needsto take a larger role in vaccine development, production, andusage?Dr. SAI.K. Yes: I do. I think that this is a major' and important public health measure. With more attention in this regard on the part of Gbkernment authorities, encouragement for the necessaryresearch wotIld be available. This would be true, as has alreadybeen mentioned, not only in improving vaccines that already existto make them risk free, but also in making vaccines available fordiseases that still are prevalent and for which preventatives are clearly required.Senator HAWKINS As you reflect back on your successes, did ittake the polio epidemic of the riffle, to bring about the solution?Dr SALK. No. Research on polio had been going on foi quitesome time.Senator HAWKINS. HOW long?Dr. SAI.K. You may recatl that Franklin Roosevelt had been para-lyzed. During his Presidency, in the year 1938, the organizationcalled the March of Dimes was created. About a decade later it became possible to say that polio was caused by three viruses. Thepolio virus could be produced in tissue culture, and soon thereafter it was possible to develop a vaccine. Polio, as an epidemic disease,had been mounting steadily for several decades. It is fortunate thata vaccine did become available when it did or else cases would havecontinued to accumulate in excess of the average of 25,000 cases ofpk)11() annuallyScrliit(lt* I IAI.VKINS Thank you, Dr. Salk.26,1 260Mr. Dodd, is it just as difficult to ascertain the identification ofthe manufacturer of a vaccine administered by a private pediatri-cian as a vaccine administered by a public clinic, in your opinion?Mr. DODD. There seems to be a dispute in the profession aboutthat issue. In California, I think we are generally blessed with avery high level of care, of health-care providers. It has not been theexperience throughout the country that that standard is necessari-ly even with regard to pertussis immunization, which is what I amfamiliar with.It appears that in some areas of the country there is a failuregenerally to follow medical contraindications. So, the exposure of aphysician in these kinds of lawsuits seems to vary a lot. There is nocommon feeling about what that exposure is. My pe:Jonal feeling isthe exposure in the situation that I am familiar with is small.However, on the other hand, that may not be the experience inother parts of the country. That is a very difficult question toanswer.Senator HAWKINS. Will the provision of the compensation optioneffectively allow negligent vaccine manufacturers and doctors toavoid liability?Mr. DODD. Well, that depends on two things. Obviously, if the billwere mandatory, there would be that risk. As tho bill presentlystands, there is authority, as I understand it, for the Governmentto pursue those individuals who the Government determines maybe culpable in some sense. Depending on how that was actually im-plemented, which I do not think is something that one could writeevery step into the billit would not be possible depending onthe manner in which the bill is implemented, that may or may notbe true. If the Government was vigorous, if the Government wasexamining records, if the Government was out there really tryingto determine culpability, I do not think it would permit the manu-facturer or health care provider who might be involved to escape.Senator HAWKINS. In your opinion, is the Government vigorousin enforcing the vaccination?Mr. Doom Enforcing the- -Senator HAWKINS. Of children before they go to school?Mr. DODD. Quite, yes. The Government is quite vigorous. Wehave heard from one gentleman about Arkansas, which I am notfamiliar with.All levels of government that I am aware of, all the way down tothe county health officials, are extremely vigorous in implementingthis policy because they know in general that immunization in thiscountry has been an enormous boon to this society, but they painteverything with a very broad brush, and it is very difficult forthem to recognize where there may be problems in our immuniza-tion policy, where immunization with certain products may bebased on faulty assumptions or false epidemiological ntlidies, falseassumptions about the vaccine. However, ge. th,.: people who implement this program from all levels are ,ni'ted to immuni- zation, and for good reason in general.SenatorHAWKINS.You heard Dr. King speak of the iesolutionthey passed in 1974.Dr. KING. I'm sorry; 1978.235 261SenatorHAWKINS.In 1978. Obviously, itwas of concern to the State health officials back in 1978. In your experience as an attor- ney, why do you feel that the same officials that are concerned don't show the same interest in reporting adverse reactions? Mr.DODD.Senator Hawkins, it has been stated by several ex- perts who routinely appear for the defense in lawsuits involving pertussis immunization that it has been known in our society for a long time that reactionsare notoriously underreported. Why thatmight be? It is very difficult to say.It may be that there is inad- equate information disseminated by the Federal Government, the local government, and the manufacturer, specifically again related to DPT, which is what I am familiar with, as to what to watch for. It may be that physiciansassume that all vaccines have the samerelative level of risk, and itmay be that physicians assume thatinjury with regard, for instance, to pertussis immunization is very rare, is very idiosyncratic, as is generally trui. with other vaccinesDr. Salk has talked about the rate of injury with regard to the polio vaccine. That is a relatively small number.It is the opinion ofmany experts that the risk related to pertus-sis immunization is not in the same ball park with these other vac-cines; that there is an order of magnitude that is incredibly multi- plied with pertussis immunization.Again, physicians familiar with the polio vaccines, with the other modern vaccines thatwe have, know in their hearts that there arepossible reactionsmaybeone or two. The common wisdom goesthat you can have a reaction to aspirin, and there have been such things reported, but these are rare; these are very rare events.Pertussis immunization,we feel. peesents a wholly different pic-ture. Of course, again, we are certainly not talking about thou- sands of children a year. Ifwe were, I don't think there would beanybody here to oppose the bill, Senator Hawkins, but we are talk- ing about a significant number of children and we are talking about young attorneys inmy position who are now losing clients todeath. Now that is a unique experience for me. I am not old enough to have a lot of clients with wills and trusts who, so the saying goes, the wills and trusts mature; the people die. But now, I am losing young clients, and these are existing clients, and theseare clients who did not come to me in time for me to help them.As I have stated inray written testimony; right now attorneysare the last resort for these children. These children all presentmassive medical records-300 or 400 pages long. They have been to the Mayo Clinic. They have been to every clinic that has a pediat- ric neurologist. Again, there is only so much that any physician can do with the kind of seizure disorder that these children are fre- quently presented with. There is only a limited amount one can do. It is unfortunately true that in order to improve the quality of life of these kids as bestwe can, it takes a great deal of money. Ittakes a great deal of professional assistance from physicians. It takes therapists. It takes paraprofessionals. There are all kinds of different things that can be done, but they are expensive. SenatorHAWKINS.But it is also expensive not to do?Mr.DODD. Ithink the secret, really, to the response to the people in regard to this hill who suggest it is going to be very expensive isand I think this has been mentioned by several physicians on266 262this paneltill se children have a built-in, fixed cost, anyway. Theyare getting supplemental social security disability. They are gettingaid from private charities. They may be getting State aid.What middle class family in this country can afford the actuarilyprojected expense to take care of one of these children? I don'tknow of any.These children have a fixed cost that our society is paying. Whatwe are talking about in this bill, I think, is focusing the cost intoone central area, but I don't see that we are increasing the cost. Icannot accept that.Senator HAwmrs. Thank you all very much for appearing withus today and helping to resolve this very significant problem forchildren and parents.Now we would like tk, call our final panel, represertatives of verybrave U.S. vaccine manufacturers: the Michigan Department ofPublic Health and Biologics, one of the two States involved in theproduction of vaccine, which was quite a surprise to methatStates are now involved in production rather than chemical manu-facturers, and they will be represented by Kenneth Eaton andVince Leone, who is assistant attorney general for the State ofMichigan.We also are privileged to have Mr. John Lyons, who is presidentof Merck Sharpe & Dohme, who is the sole producer of the vaccinefor MMRmeasles, mumps, and rubella. He will be here accompa-nied by counsel.In addition, we would like to say that Wyeth Laboratories andLederle Laboratories have submitted testimony for the record.[The prepared statements of Wyeth States SenatEWashington, D. C. 20510Dear Senator Hawkins:I wish to respond on behalf of Wyeth Laboratories, a divisionof American Home Products Corporation, a manufacturer ifvaccine products, to your invitation to comment on SenateBill S.2117, the National Childhood Vaccine-Injury Compensa-tion Act.we submit this written statement for the recordof the hearing schedule,: cm May 3, 1984 before the SenateLabor and Human Resources Committee.Let me first compliment yod on your efforts on behalf ofchildhood immunization in the United States. This program,so fundamental to our nation's public health objectives,is certain to benefit from your personal interest.The purpose of ;1.2117 to establish \"a simple, no-fault,expedited, to+ transaction cost, nonadversarial, andeffective national program for assuring the provizinn of%)mper.sation to children and others who have suu%ainedva-:cile-related injury\" is certainly a rational, societaljudgmlnt and one with which would not quarrel. We must,however, respectfully disagree with limiting the program toa \"non-mandatory alternative to the current tort system\".wp feel the program shot'ld be mandatory.To provide compensation for the injured recipients ofchildhood vaccine is to remove but one of the threats to 268 264 national immunization objectives. The manufacturers whoassure continued development and availability of vabcinesare also threatened. We, as well as vaccine recipients,can be victims of the excesses and vt_aries of the currenttort system.As an example, time periods for claim. ,ndsuits by minors can exist until such minor reaches a m, rarityMtge, placing a burden on all parties, a burden of unknownrisk that may be as long as 20 years. Health care personnelare equally burdened. Removing, or denying recipients, thepertussis component of the vaccine may resolve the liabiltypotential but obviously this is not a satisfactory publ.,health solution. To preserve the immunization system ?nuto extend it to other disease states, a singular legislativeremedy is now required, one whic!. covers all participants --including manufacturers, distributors, and the people re-sponsible for the administration of the vaccine.The proponents of the current tort system speak of the needn)t to abqolve manufacturers from liability for negligence.We support the continuation of manufacturer liability forany vaccine not meeting government standards.We feel very strongly that the legislative remedy finallychosen must cover all participants of what is now a veryeffective immunization chain. Otherwise this chain couldhe broken at any point from the d.elopment of new vaccinesthrough continuing availability of current vaccines, to thevery point of advice, counsel and administration of thevaccine.Fur these reasons we submit that to be effectiveany Federal compensation program for vaccine injury musthe an exclusive, mandatory remedy.This is such a fundamental, overriding consideration, we(icter detailed comments on S.2i17 to focus solelyon thiA issue. We hope you will appreciate our concern.very truly yours, Richard [lowish, Ph.D.President 265 Statement by Lederle Laboratories,Division of American Cyanamid Company forsubmission to the Senate Committee onLabor and Human Resources in response tothe Committee's May 9, 1984request for comments upon 5.2117,tLe N.itional Childhood Vaccine-Injury Compensation Act. May 15, 1984 270 / 266 Vaccine InjurirSempensstion LegislationLederle Statement Lederle appreciates the opportunity offered by the committee to comment upon S2I17, The Motional Childhood Vaccine-Injury Compensation Act. Senator Hawkins' sensitive concern about the problem of no-fault vaccine injury has served to focus Congressional attention upon a complex and trodhlesome situation.It adversely affects both those udfortunately injured and the manufacturers who develop snd produce the vaccines responsible for disease prevention. the problem of deviling a system for no-fault vaccine-injury compensation which is fair th the injured party, does not discourage private sector manufacturing and distribution or, research and development of new and approved vaccines and whose costs can be held within reasonable and predictable limits has thus far resisted solution. while the problem exists in most developed nations, it appears that a greater meaxere of control is exercised in those countries than in the United States 1.1r three major reasons. One, existing systems of relatively comprehensive nartonal halth insurance; two,, direct government ownership or indirect suhitdization and/or protection from foreign competition of vaccine manulakturers; three, significantly lower rate of recourse to litigAtion in v,.. to- iniory ,as.x si more effe,tive limitation of award amounts. 271 0 267 Historically, normal United States market forces have served this country wellin maintaining a vigorous and effective domestic vaccine industry.TheUnited States has long been the world leader in the development of newyd.:clops.There is every reason to believe such leadership can be maintainedif actions are taken to balance certain negative conditions which have arisenwithin the past decade or so. Insr negative conditions include increased costs, limitations on adequatepricing, extensive regulatory requirements, excessive litigation and awards,increased United States competition from relatively protected foreignmanifaetners, a static or decreasing market for the basic vaccines andtn.oeip,ato patent protection for research and development of new and improvedva,:cinos. If one of the ubiectives of 52111 is to assure a vigorous domestic vaccineresource, itis important to recognize that the problem is larger than vaccineinjury ..minsation and perhaps more importantly, that actions taken relativeto compensation will almost certainly affect other significant problem areas. At. has been pointed out in a study proposal by W. K. Mariner to the Department tH41th and Hoehn Services, \"There is still surprisingly little analysis of!t,t in the United States of possible alternatives [invaccine injury celpensation], whether they would be consistent with legalit elifii.111.11,10role of government in this country, whether they would be,stly th.01 th primate or1,',11. he I:tr.\". 272 268 Lederle believes it is in the public interest that proposed reforms, whether legislative or regulatory, should be subject to such snalysis before they are considered for passage or adoption. The Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences is presently engaged in a fact-finding study which should contribute valuable data for such analysis. ( Lederle, among others, has made a major financial contribution to support the ION study.) While all vaccines may be considered preventive, the field is divided among several sub-categories such as: vaccines against communicable diseases (childhood and/or adult); vaccines against non-communicable diseases (such as tetanus); vaccines required by statute; vaccines which are optional. Although the problems stated above affect all vaccines to one degree or another, 82117 is largely restricted to those which are mandated for children and deals specifically with only one of the inter-related problems -- that of compensation for vaccine-related injuries. The following general comments concern selected provisions of 52117 and clearly indicate the need for further study to assure that the apparent solution of one vaccine problem does not exacerbate other related serious problems. Non:-Fx0ysive_Remedy lb, hilt provides a person who allegedly receives a vaccine-related injury with the option of bringing a lawsuit in the courts or to elect compensation. however, during the process of initiating the compensation option, it is 273 269 possible under the Bill for 4 person to resort to tort law if that seems thesurer way to a more favorable award. In addition, civil tons may bebrought against the Secretary of H.H.S. where there is an alleged failureonhta part. InasmUch as the existence of a compensation system will almost.surely increasethe number of claims and the unpredictability of tort law awards will not berelteved under these provisions, it is more than likely that the costs forno-faultcases will increase rather than be reduced. Since the probability ofreforming state and federal liability law affecting these cases is ratherremote, the non-exclusive remedy provisions of 52117 must be consideredunacceptable to the public a: well as manufacturers. Surcharge The \"National Vaccine-Injury Compensation Trust Fund\" which would beestablished under 52117 to pay claims under the Act would, in effect, merelycreate a middleman entity between the manufacturer and its insurance resource.All costs would still be .,aid by the manufacturer through the surcharge levy. The surcharge would cover only that part.ibf the claimsagainst the manufacturer brought through the compensation scheme. Claimsawarded under the allowed tort option would be handled under a second system -- the present one. As statA anove, since lt is highly probable that the existence of a14,veiument tuten4tion source wilt increase the number of claims withoutooterriog any higher level of costs predictability, it is by no means clear 274 b: ;.0that the surcharge system offers any advantage for the manufacturer or thevo publtc.In addition, the added Losts for administering the middleman \"Trusttund\".could be substantial. On a more fund4mental level, the practice of holding manufacturers responsiblefor non-fault vaccine injuries is based upon the \"deep pocket\" assumption.The -ecordofthesubstantial decrease in the nuber of United States vaccinemanufacturers, whicb includes the loss of vaccine research resources, whilenotentirely attributable to claim.), is compelling evidence that this approach to tnappropitilte for vaccines.

Ho, suchexplanation and documentation would rarely be available in cases of SIDS,idiopathic epilepsy, mental retardatiol and other diseases which have anatural occurrence rate. It seems clear that the injury assessment problems which have proven sotroublesome and costly under tort law claims will be little or no lest sounder the proposed compensation system. Indeed, to the extent that thecompensation court establishes record of relative strictness in assessment,i/the avail.sie tort option will no doubt prove increasingly popular forclaimants.

We. believe that the present tort actions against against the manufacturer in such cases anc the manufacturer surcharge system under 82117 are entirely inappropriate. Itis generally recognized that the existence of this-Anomaly has contributec significantly to the decline in the.number of United States vaccine manufacturers. 0 Whether theosts are borne by the manufaci.urer, the medical professional involved or the government, it is in the public interest that adequate and timely ,,:overage iavailable for no-fault injuries with a minimum of sextraneous cost. l'h compen.ition benefits offered by 52117 go beyond providing the expeditious ovr4g of medr al expenses 'for families when they need it most.

These include state and fegeraily-agsisted programs for disabled and crippled children, special education, vocational rehabilitation, mental health centers ;Ind others.An of ouch redund4ncy :wars worthwhile since the administrative ,ofiry rloird by the Rill's provisions would constitute a new cost center. X77 -273 A significant cost problem in tort cases is that oflegsl fees. It has beenestimated by Senator Kasten, Chairman of Commerceel Consumer Subcommittee,the. for every six cents awarded to an injured person in product liabilitycases. seven cents is paid for legal expense. The dual-remedy provision ofS2117 serves to perpetuate such inequity. Similarly, it appears inappropriatefor the Sill to provide mandatory coverage of attorney', fees forrepresentation in no-fault compensation proceedings. Certainly, theadditional attorney compensation of 252 of the entire award provided for inthe Bill must be considered excessive. Adviso ry Commission The composition of the proposed Aivisory Commission does not include memberswith the qualifications necessary-to :srrs Jut or oversee the broad range ofspecialized responsibilities autnorixed by the Bill. These responsibilitiesinclude supplies of safe and effective vaccines, implementation of theprogram.. vaccine surcharges and research. However, sut.icient experts and advisory committees already exist and theSecretary of HES has the authority to assign employees, hire additionalwitsid experts, establish informal committees and obtain public COMMISOLTIeV.iiit to the nee:. Of 5.117.4 The provisions which subordinate the authority of the Secretary to that of the,\"MMI4clon in areas specifically included in the Secretary's responsibilitiesis 4tyll instance of the unnecessary and costly redundancy imposed bythe Bill.We believe these provisions should be amended to correct suchtettencies.

ConnaughtLabr:)raturies,Inc. agrees with and embraces the past and presentefforts of the federal government and supports the concept ofcompensation for childhood vaccine-related injuries. Given thepublic health need for continued vaccine availability at areasonable price, a national childhood vaccine injury compensationAct providing compensation for present and prospective lossesincurred or to be incurred as a result of suffering vaccine-rQlated injuries is most desirable. Such a federal system ofcompensation should recognize the national scope of the publichealth issue and the interests nerved by continuing vaccinationswhile providing for a unified disposition of bona fide injuriesresulting from receipt of certain childhood vaccines. It is the position of Connaught Laboratories, Inc. that at.,childhood vaccine injury compensation legislation should provide:or an exclusive remedy available to individuals injured as atesult of receiving certain childhood vaccines. Legislationproviding for compensation on an elective basis, that is,legislation permitting a choice be,:ween proceeding through thecurrent tore system, or accepting compensation under thelegislation, while providing recognition of the responsibilityto establish a national vaccine injury compensation program, willnor avoid the current adverse impact upon the continued availabilityof desirable childhood vaccines at a reasonable price. AsLe!rently written, S.2111 by its terms permits an election by apt:rson assumed to have suffered a vaccine-related injury to pursue 279 275 compensation under the program up to (but prior) to the entryof proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, or a finaljudgment on a petition for compensation under the program, andto thereafter terminate the proceedings under the program_, infavor of prosecution of a civil action under our current tortsystem.Thus, irrespective of the neriousness of the injury,a claimant might weigh the value of the claim under the FederalCompensation Act against the potential value of a civil actionarlising out of the game Incident. Requiring a manufacturer tocontribute to a trust fund designed to provide compensation foruurtain childhood vaccine-related injuries while continuing topermit such manufacturer to be exposed to liability, in perhapsan amount greater than that which the federal legislationwould provide, would have the result of continuous jeopardy tothe supply of existing vaccines at a reasonable price, as wellas providing for a chilling effect on the development of newva,eincs. In addition. any legislation providing for compensation ofcertain childhood vaccine-related injuries should be administeredfruc from applicable regulation and influence by those unfamiliarwith the nature of the significant public he-Hr.h interestsNerved by vaecinCs and those who might he biased or prejudicedin view of some personal or financial circumstances. Legislation providing for compensation of certain childhoodvaccine- related injuries should be designed to provide compen-,ation for losses presently and prospectively incurred whileavoiding non-inert Lorious claims and continued potential catas-traphiL liability of health care providers and manufacturers.Neither health care provialers nor the vaccine manufacturinglndustry would realistically expect absolute immunity from anyand 411 dC: ion taken with respect to vaccines, however, LO providefor federal legislation without due repard for the interests ofiii parties involved would not he in the hest interest of society's 2 6 0 276SenatorilAWKINS.We really do appreciate your ceming end rep-resenting your company, Mr. Lyons.STATEMENT OF JOHN E. LYONS, PRESIDENT, MERCK SHARP &DOIIME, DIVISION OF MERCK & CO., INC., ACCOMPANIED BYWILLIAM B. FREILICH, COUNSELMr. LYONS. Thank you, Senator Hawkins.My name is John Lyons, and I am president of Merck Sharp &I)ohme, which is the U.S. prescription drug division of Merck & Co.I am honored to offer testimony before this committee today.Merck appreciates your strong interest in our Nation's childhoodimmunization program and welcomes the opportunity to present anindustrial point of view concerning one very important aspect of it:The need for a fair and adequate compensation system for personsadversely affected by vaccinations in publicly funded programs.We have high praise for the attention being given to this issue.However, we believe that S. 2117, as written, does not meet theneeds Jim which it is intended. Specifically, we urge that the pro-posed legislation be modified to provide an exclusive remedy to theproblem it addresses.Merck's commitment to the development of vaccines and theiruse is a longstanding and well-recognized one. The returns to socie- ty on that commitment have been enormously gratifying, as vacci-nation has drastically lowered the toll of infectious diseases.During the past four decades, Merck has been fortunate to haveparticipated in the development of vaccines to prevent life-threat-ening and debilitating diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella,meningitis, pneumococcal pneumonia, and hepatitis B. Currently,with the largest private investment hi vaccine research in theUnited States, scientists in our laboratories are now working onvaccines against a wide range of diseases, including hepatitis A,chickenpox, herpes simplex 1 and 2, neonatal meningitissepticemia,and toward disease prevention through vaccina -'tion has been meritorious, it has not been as productive as mighthave been hoped. There are several :easons for this, including theproblems associated with liability in public health immunizationprograms.It is obvious that the vaccine industry in the United States is notas strong a resource today as it once was. Yet, the future of domes- tic vaccine supply depends on the continued willingness and abilityof the pharmaceutical industry to produce adequate quantities ofvaccine and to develop the vaccines of tomorrow. Clearly, a majorimpediment to commercial initiatives in this field is the unresolvedpublic policy problem of liability in mass vaccination programs.As we have seen today, although most vaccines are extraordinar-ily safe, they can be associated with adverse reactions in a smallpercentage of the people who use them. Most of these reactions areminor anself-limiting, but some very rare reactions car: be harm-ful, even fatal.Seldom, if ever, is anyone at fault when these unfortunate inci-dents occur. Yet, still, when millions of persons are vaccinated,some will experience adverse reaction:;. 2Si. 277The courts have understandably sought to compensate injured persons. It is true that the past experience of manufacturers withregard to court decisions cannot justify changing the present tort system of compensation. However, the unpredictability of the future is clearly a disincentive for vaccine innovation in the United States. It is a majorreason several manufacturers have abandonedthe vaccine business in recent years.A workable vaccine compensation system should serve three ob- jectives beyond its primarypurpose of helping the victims of ad-verse reactions: first,it should increase the willingness of thepublic to participate in immunization programs; second, it should help assure the continued willingness of physicians and other health care professionals to conduct immunization programs; and third, it should encourage manufacturers to provide vaccine not only for existing programs, but also to devote substantial resources '.o the discovery and development of new vaccines. To reach the first objective,a compensation system must providea fair, easily accessible, and prompt remedy. The present tort system amounts to a lottery. It has not worked well and has result- ed in many ppablems. Ifa compensation system promply and fairlycompensates all injured persons for their actual losses, there is no need to continue the tort system alternative. A fair compensation system will accomplish this objective and help provide for the other two. But truly assuring the availability of vaccines and immuniza- tion programs underour current system can only be accomplishedby creating an exclusive remedy for injured vaccines. The existing tort systemposes a number of problems, the mostsignificant of which is its unpredictability. Courts in each of the 50 States are free tc, developnew rules of liability at any time andwithout prior notice. Even when the basic rules are not changed, the strong and understandable desire of juries and courts to com- pensate injured persons can lead to determinations of liability that are against the weight of medical evidence. Both health care pro- fessionals and manufacturers have, on occasion, found themselves liable for circumstancesover which they could exercise little or nocontrol.For example, manufacturers have been held responsible for not warning vaccinees or their parents or guardians of all risks in- volved in receivinga vaccine, even though the vaccination programwas controlled and run by public health officials. Confronted withthisunpredictability,manufacturers and health professionals cannot accurately estimate their risks nor plan their insurance re- quirements.The tort system also offers little protection against gtoundless or trivial claims filed for their nuisance or settlement value. Such cases often generate substantial legal costs that can multiply to sig- nificant proportions if the program is highly publicized such as oc- curred with swine flu in 19'76.In conclusion, we would like to leave you with two principal thoughts. First, a dual compensation system that offers a choice of either going to the tort or to the no-fault concept does not alleviate the problems I have cited. There is, however, a place for the tort system in a compensation program. 1-.;t41,282 278For example, when a manufacturer .fails to produce a vaccine inaccordance with Government standards or a health care providerfails to administer the vaccine in accordance with medical stand-ards, the tort system should be open for an injured party to recov-er. But; to accomplishthe objectives of fair compensation, the tortsystem should be eliminated from any other type of action. There-fore, our second conclusion is that only a compensation system em-bracing the concepts of no-fault and exclusive remedy can providethe basis for truly fair and workable legislation.There is no easy solution to the vaccine liability problem, but webelieve some action must be taken by the Government to avert im-pediments to future immunization efforts. With the changes wehave suggested, S. 2117 could be a very productive step in the di-rection of disease prevention.Thank you, Senator.Senator HAWKINS. Thank you very much, Mr. Lyons.Mr. Eaton, may we hear from you?STATEMENT OF KENNETH L. EATON, INTERGOVERNMENTAL OF-FICER, MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, ACCOM-PANIED BY VINCENT J. LEONE, ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENER-AL, STATE OF MICHIGANMr. EATON. Thank you, Senator Hawkins.May we add to the very justifiable commendations you have beenreceiving for ycur excellent leadership in this issue. It is one thathas been neglected for far too long, and we wish to offer our contin-ued interest and cooperation.The Michigan Department of Public Health is involved in thisfrom several different points of view, some of them potentially con-flicting. On the one hand, we are involved as a manufacturer ofvaccines. We are also involved in protecting the public health. Asyou have heard today, there are different sets of problems on bothsides of that issue.We are also involved in intensive research and developmentabout vaccine improvements and have been involved in biologicsand the development of vaccines for several years.Rather than to add to the already excellent testimony you havereceived from scientific experts and others about the medical andscientific issues, we have chosen to emphasize our point of view aspublic policy entities and to discuss with you some of the problemswe have faced and how we feel your legislation can benefit us.We are, as you mentioned, one of only two Government agenciesdirectly involved in the production of vaccines. This makes us per-haps more acutely aware than many health departments might beof the need for a publicly coorainated compensation system whichwill encourage the production of vaccines by providing for the careof those few who are unavoidably injured by adverse reactions.It is our concern for vaccine-injured children as well as for chil-dren who may suffer a communicable disease due to the potential unavailability of vaccine which leads us to support your proposedlegislation in Senate bill 2117.We are currently involved, unavoidably, in a number of lawsuitsbecause of our production of vaccines. Frankly, a tempting solution 253 279to this potential liability on the part of the Government whichdeals not only with the economic pressures it brings, but with thepolitical implications it brings, is to consider joining the ranks ofother former vaccine producers and cease production of vaccines toprotect ourselves. We resist and dislike this solution becauseof ourdedication to protecting children against communicable disease,but we must .acknowledge that the increasing pressure of escalat-ing costs and a heavy volume of litigation may force us in the fore-seeable future to discontinue this operation or seriously considersuch action.However, in the meantime, and still as public health advocates,we continue to produce over a million doses If DPT vaccine a year,despite the increasing complications related to several lawsuits.As the committee has heard and reported on several different oc- casions, we all acknowledge the very important role that vaccinesplay in controlling and eradicating many diseases, and yet, on the other hand, we also understand that there seems to be a predict-able small numberof adverse reactions which can be very serious.We are involved in research and development activities and doanticipate in the future some improvements in these vaccines, butitis important to know that unavoidable injury to children willremain with us for some time. Advances do not seem on the offingin the extremely near future. I won't go into details. If we can be helpful to the committee in providing any information about theresearch that we are conducting or other activities, please be as-sured that we will be happy to provide that, but have not chosen totake your time today; I know you are running short.We do have some reservations and some concerns about the legis-lation which Mr. Leone and I would like to mention to you Howev-er, I would like to make the point that as a new framework for asystem of restitution to vaccine-injured children, this bill is far, farsuperior to the only other avenue currently available, and that islawsuits and this court system which you have heard so muchabout.I would like to ask Mr. Leone to make some brief remarks aboutwhat we face in that respect, and then I have a few concluding sug-gest ions.Senator HAWKINS. Thank you, Mr. Eaton.Mr. Leone?Mr. LEONE. Senator, my name is Vincent Leone. I am assistantattorney general for the State of Michigan.I think Mr. Eaton has indicated that the Michigan Departmentof Public Health is a unique position on this issue, both as public health administrators and as producer of vaccines for over 50years.I am here today not only as a public health advocate and as alawyer defending the Michigan Department of Public Health in anumber of lawsuits, but as the father of' two boys. I think the mostsaddening aspect of my work is listening to a mother's anguishwhen her child's condition, her second-grader's condition, preventshim from even finding the bathroom in the school and even know-ing where he is once he searches for it. 2S1 280In all candor, in the cases that I have been involved in and incase studies that I have read about, I firmly believe that very, veryfew children have been injured by vaccine.I even think under this no-fault system, which would eliminatethe issue of negligence and perhaps lessen the burden of causation,that very few children would qualify under the system.I still support the bill, and the department of public health sup-ports the bill, because I think it would promote the reliable vaccine supply, which is the greatest concern to health officials. It wouldalso provide a quicker and more straightforward way for parentswith injured children to learn whether their children are hurt byan act of man or an act of God.I think the written comments that have been submitted to yourcommittee outline the problems that the department has with thetort liability system and what the department's role and rights should be under a no-fault system, so I won't reiterate those at thistime.However, I think it should be said that the specter of lawsuits,and even the existence of a no-fault system, may suggest to mil-lions of parents out there that there are problems with the vaccine.I think perhaps we have greater problems with the tort liabilitysystem. We have such problems with that that we developed a workmen's compensation system decades ago. Many States haveno-fault car insurance statutes.Frankly, I believe that the health of our children, the health ofthe public in general, is too important to be left solely to attorneys.With the few reservations that we have indicated in our writtencomments and any that you care to address to me today, the Michi-gan Department of Public Health supports the bill.Thank you.Mr. EATON. We would like to make one or two suggestions, Sena,tor. Mr. Leone indicated a few of his reservations.We do have some concerns about some of the recordkeeping re-quirements, not in opposition to the need for information, but, forexample, in mass immunization settings meeting the requirementor assuring that requirements are met to place information in each individual's permanent medical record will be very difficult. Insome occasions in mass immunization settings it may even be im- possible to insure. Sometimes there are to permanent recordsavailable to us.We would like, also, to raise a question about the wisdom of im-posing a surcharge of any amount on vaccines to finance the com-pensation program. Since many of the vaccines encompassed bythis bill are going to be obtained by the States with public funds,much of that Federal grant funds, a surcharge on the vaccines will simply raise the price which the Federal Government must paythrough grants to the States in order to meet the public need. For those who privately pay for their vaccines, there reaily is little op-portunity to shop for less expensive vaccine, and perhaps there is no equity in being required to pay a higher price for a vaccinewhich has caused a no-fault injury in the past.With the precipitous decline in private manufacturers of vac-cines, one might even wonder whether some of the manufacturers 2Sti 281would even object to its product being priced out of the market. Wehave seen many leave the market for a similar reason.As for a department such as ours, we have a question as to how asurcharge would be imposed on its vaccine which is produced atthe expense already of the Michigan treasury and distributed to its citizens free of charge. It is difficult for us to conceptualize anequity in paying a surcharge again to the national compensationtund with that respect.We will be happy to work with you in terms of alternatives. Youhave received several suggestions in other testimony:With these few reservations, we support S. 2117. It clearly is aninnovative effort to provide just compensation for vaccine-injuredindividuals. We hope it will be at least one good step in encourag-ing the production of vaccines to control communicable disease and thereby promote public health, which is a big, big priority to us.We offer our continued cooperation and assistance, and againwish to thank you for your leadership,[The joint prepared statement of Mr. Eaton and Mr. Leone fol-lows, I 21: 282 STATEMENT OFKENNETH L. EATONINTER-GOVERNMENTAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH andVINCENT J. LEONEASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERALSTATE OF MICHIGAN before the COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCES .UNITED STATES SENATE on S.2117THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURYCOMPENSATION ACT MAY 3, 1984 257 28.3Or. The Michigan Department of Public Health (MDPH) is theagency in the State of Michigan responsible for the protectionand promotion of the public health of the citizens of Michigan.MDPH has been a recognized leadein the identification anderadication of communicable diseases due principally to itsongoing commitment to a state laboratory for. the development ofvaccines and other biologics for distribution within Michigan.With over 100 years of public health experience, and as one ofonly two government agencies directly involved in the productionof vaccines, MDPH is uniquely aware of the need for a publiclycoordinated compensation system which will encourage the produc-tion of vaccines by providing for the care of those few who areunavoidably injured by these vaccines. It' is this concern forvaccine-inlured children, as well as any ohildren who may suffera communicable disease due to the unavailability of a vaccine,%which leads MDPH to support Senate Bill 2113, entitled \"TheNational Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act\".MDPH is currently involved in a number of lawsuitsbecause of its production of vaccines. An easy, but shortsightedsolution to this potential liability is to join the ranks ofother tomer vaccine producers and cease production. However,MDPH felts that such an action will jeopardize its ability toensure that hundreds of thousands of children are provided withprotection against communicable diseases each year.Thus, aspublic h0,11th to produce over a rrfP vae;:Lne a year, despite this ever incteasing expobureto lawsuits. t.+ 288 284 Unfortunately, as all recognize, the protection pro-vided by these vaccines, has its drawbacks. Some children areinjured by the vaccine itself. Despite anticipated improvementsin these vaccines, the potential for unavoidable injury to childrenwill remain for some time. Senate Bill 2117 will provide anequitable system for identifying and.providing for the care ofchildren injured by vaccines. This is not to say that MDPHsupports this bill without reservations. However, as a newframework for a system of restitution to vaccine-injured children,this bill.s far superior to the only other avenue currentlyavailable -- a lawsuit.%The current method for seeking redress of injuriesbythe institution of a tort action in the courts is unworkable forboth the producer and ultimate user of these vaccines. First,since virtually all recipients of the vaccine are children, thetime period for bringing an action in the courts is often as longas two decades. This prevents the vaccine producer from havingany realistic estimate of its potential liability or enable it tomodify its activity in a timely fashion to improve its operations.For the child, this may mean that his/her lawsuit is not pursuedexpeditiously; and as the facts surrounding the inoculationbecome more remote with time, the costs of litigation increase.Secondly, the traditional principals for maintaining atort actin may be subordinated to the greater social issue ofthe protection of the public against the spread of communicablediseases.Under this country's jurisprudence, a maker of aproduct generally has a duty to provide a safe reliable productto the ultimate user. If the producer does not believe it can 2S9 285 clearly meet this duty, it will often cease production. However,these vaccines must be produced in order to control communicablediseases notwithstanding the recognized risk involved in theiruse.Thus, in the face of this higher social goal, the courtsmay be more willing to require that compensation be paid by avaccine producer, who is not negligent, for a vaccine whichnonetheless unavoidably injured a child.A private manufacturer theoretically absolves itselffrom responsibility for a vaccine-injured child if it did notnegligently manufacture the vaccine, and it provided the acceptedwarnings against contraindications or the potential for adversereactions.To the injured child needing compensation in order toeffectively operate in society, this is of little consolation.Yet, the further the court system strays from traditional notionsof liability of a producer to its customers for the sake of ahigher social goal, the greater the risk that the few remainingprivate manufacturers of vaccines will abandon this alreadyunattractive endeavor.Finally, it shotld not be forgotten that the traditionaltort system is an adversarial process. Opposing sides argued themerits of their case with the hoped for result that the truthwill prevail.In vaccine suits, external factors may tilt thisbalance to the advantage of one party. For example, since childrenare often less than a year old when they receive their inoculation,almost any malady that the child experiences throughout his/herlife can be arguably attributed to the vaccine. Yet, manygenetic or idiopathic conditions do not become apparent until achili 1% older. 290 286 On the other hand, few of the reactions to these vaccinesare easily identifiable or can be shown to be exclusively caused 4114`,by the vaccines. Thus, childtekwho cannot produce a docuMentedhistory of inoculations, immediate identifiable reactions: andmajor injuries may be unable to seek recourse through the tort system.MDPH's involvement in vaccine lawsuits places it in theuncomfortable position of pursuing both its constitutional mandateto promote the public health by identifying those suffering from health-related problems while concurrently protecting the publictreasury from meritless claims. Yet, the position of privatemanufacturers is no less comforting as they are expected to meetthe nation's demand for improved vaccines with fewer and feweradverse reactions under an adversary legal system which by rightchallenges every initiative taken by them.Can a meaningfuldialogue take place between all concerned parties on the relativebenefits and risks of altering vaccine immunization policy whenthis public health issue has serious ramifications on the finan- cial liability of the participants?The adverse impact of the -t system on these publichealth issues has convinced MDPH that the better route for all parties istheleo-fault compensation system proposed by NB 2117. Public health concerns would be best served if the new system was the exclusive remedy. However, MDFH believes that those truly injured by vaccines are not seeking a windfall from their tragedy and will opt for the certainty and timeliness of relief underthis equitable compensation system over the vagaries of the tort 11.01111ty route. 291 287 MDPH does have reservations about certain aspects ofthe bill as now written, which it believes should be revised orzlarified.One concern is over the costs and responsibility ofthe extensive recording requirements provided for by the bill.though such requirements are helpful in processing the claims ofthose few who are Injured, the responsibility for ensuring thatthe required information is placed in each individual's permanentmedical record will be burdensome, if riot impossible, especiallyin the mass immunization setting.A second concern is for the rights of the producers ofvaccines in the compensation process. Though MDPH does notpropose an adversary system, ..t suggests that a vaccine producershould have the right to submit information which, in the wordsof the bill, better explains the cause of the illness or eventunrelated to the administration of the vaccine. A vaccineproducer is an interested party in this process since the federalgovernment obtains a subrogated right to sue it for negligenceand raise its vaccine surcharge upon an award of compensationunder a no-fault system. Furthermore, if vaccine production isto be encouraged as envisioned by this bill, the subrogation ofa public plaintiff, the federal government, for a private one,the injued party, should not. occur except where it appears thatthere has been a clear case of negligence on the part of theproducer.MDPH questions the propriety of imposing a surcharge ofany amount on vaccines. Since many of the vaccines encompassedby this bill will be obtained by states through federal grants, asurcharw on the vaccines will simply raise the price which the 292 I 288 federal government must pay in order to meet public need. Forthose who pay privately for their vaccine, there is little oppor-tunity to shop for a less expensive vaccine or any equity inbeing required to pay a higher price for a vaccine which hascaused \"no-fault\" injuries in the past. With the precipitousdecline in private manufacturers of vaccines, it //dSbatablewhether a manufacturer would even object to its product beingpriced out of the market. As for MDPH itself, the questionremains as to how a surcharge would be imposed on its vaccinewhich is produced at the expense of the Michigan Treasury anddistributed to its citizens free of charge.Finally, MDPH cannot entirely accept the vaccine injurytable as written, and would like the opportunity to provide imputon the determination of recognized reactions and the time periodwithin which' the reactions are to occur for compensation to beprovided to a petitioner.In conclusion, with these few reservations, MDPH supportsHouse Bill 2117, the National Childhood Vaccine rnjury CompensationAct, as an innovative effort to provide just compensation tovaccine-injured individuals, to encourage the production ofvaccines to control comrlunicablgt diseases, and to thereby promotepublic health. 4 293 289Senator HAWKINS. Thank you for your being so helpful. I like to tell everyone that I brought my attorney and my doctor with me, too. Robin Rushton and Dr. David Sundwall are watching over me with great care.Your department, Mr. Eaton, of health and biologics is only one of two State governmental agencies, as I understand it, that is in-volved in the production of vaccines. What prompted your agency to get in this area?Mr. EATON. It is historic, Madam Chairman. It was basically theessence of our health department's efforts when it began. As Mr.Leone said, I think it has been about 40 years since we have been in this.Our initiative was spurred by a need to be directly responsivetothe immunization needs of our own population. We had a setting within our legislature that was conducive to our responding imme- diately to it, and from that point it has been somewhat of a tradi- tion of our department.Mr. Leone has also been digging deeply into the history becauseof his involvement with our lawsuits and may wish to add some- thing to that.Mr. LEONE. I catr just say, Senator, that Dr. Prokindrick and Dr.Elder ling from the Michigan Department of Public Health devel-oped the first effective pertussis vaccine back in the 1930's andtested it in Grand Rapids, where it had the highest incidence ofpertussis in the world at the time.That is a problem that I think some of the other participants inthis meeting have touched upon. When you have something that isso highly successful, the ability to improve it, especially under atort liability system that challenges every change you make, be-comes very difficult.Senator HAWKINS. Are you aware of the Japanese vaccine forpertussis?Mr. EATON. I am not personally familiar with it, Ma'am, no. Senator HAWKINS. I believe you recently received an NIH grantto enter research for a safer vaccine. Is that correct?Mr. EATON. Yes, Ma'am, we did.Senator HAWKINS. Was the grant adequate to cover your costs?Mr. EATON. Probably not. Most of them don't.We are just beginning that work. The grant was awarded withinthe past few months. We do hope that it can make a contributionto improved vaccines and are optimistic that it can, but I wouldagain point out that that is slow work. It is difficult and tediouswork to do.We would be more than pleased to keep the committee informedabout our progress and provide you with information as to whatspecifically we are attempting to accomplish.Senator HAWKINS. Thank you.Does the department of health and biologics charge for DPTdosage?Mr. LEONE. Nothing.Mr. EATON. We don't. We don't charge unless, for some reason,an out-of-State agency finds itself short of the vaccine and asks usto provide it. We don't make an effort to do that, but we do try, tokeep a sufficient stock so that we can occasionally respond to that.294 ,290Then we do ask them topay what we call costs. I am not reallysure what it is. We are not even sure what it costs us to produce a dose of that vaccine, butwe distribute it within the State free ofcharge.Senator HAWKINS. Outside of the State do you make a profit? Mr. EATON. No, we wouldn't make a profit. We would try to esti- mate what it costs us to produce it and ask them to meet that cost as reimbursement.Senator HAWKINS. I know that Michigan, like every other State, must be trying to reduce its cost of government. Is your vaccine program in any danger?Mr. EATON. I wouldsay so. We have not entered into highlyformal discussions with the legislature about the prospect of discon- tinuing or cutting backon the operation, but it is becoming in-creasingly difficult for us to face the prospect of the added cost for continued improvements and updating of our laboratory, and there are, as you might understand, several who would question the need for the use of public funds in the State of Michigan to produce vac- cines which many people think are commonly produced and will dependably be produced in the future by private manufacturers. So it is an annual discussion that we have incessantly, and each year we feel a greater vulnerability to our capacity to defend the propri-ety of continued public expenditures for this purpose. It is going to become a more difficult problem, we predict. Senator HAWKINS. Thank you.Mr. Lyons, what is the status of future vaccines being developed by Merck?Mr. LYONS. As I pointed out in my testimony, 'we are currently working now on hepatitis A vaccine, herpes simplex 1 and 2-- Senator HAWKINS. Chickenpox?Mr. LYONS. Chickenpox, the varicella vaccine. There is a vaccine that we have been workingon since about 1962, and we have justcompleted its first use ina large clinical trial. It probably won't beavailable for another 2or 3 years. That additional developmenttime could be rather long.Senator HAWKINS. Do you have a history of upgrading your mea- sles vaccine?Mr. LYONS. Yes, we do. Our vaccine research and development is directed not only toward vaccines to protect against diseases for which no other vaccine is available, but also current vaccines. The first measles vaccine thatwe produced was in 1963. That was aproduct that required the coadministratior. of gamma globulin be- cause of a high incidence of reactogenicity. We improved that andcane out with another vaccine in 1969. Since that time, we have improved it further. We also just came out with a new pneumocco- cal vaccine. The original vaccine was a 14-valent vaccine, and we just came out with a 23-valent vaccine. Vaccine R&D is an ongoing process.Senator HAWKINS. We really want to praise you as a committee for coming today and helping us with this record. We may not agree on every point and paragraph of S. 2117, but I believe we all agree on the need to modify the current method of compensatingchildren for injuries. I think these children have an urgent need 295 291and deserve simple justice quickly. That is not always the role ofGovernment, to move very rapidlyWe really appreciate your willingness to be with us today, all of the witnesses who participated in the development of the record. Iwould like to praise the two vaccine manufacturers who came heretoday. I urge you to continue to upgrade your vaccines and contin-ue research on safer vaccines. I think that is probably the bottomline that we have here as a mission for the future and as we look at the past. We have to resolve how we address the solutior tothose problems of the past.[Additional material supplied for the record follows:] 296 292 U.S. Department of Justice Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs Vince of the Attiltant Attorney General Werhingron. D.C. 2053014JV10Honorable Orrin G. HatchChairmanLabor and Human Resources CommitteeUnited States SenateWashington, D.C. 20510Dear Mr. Chairman:This letter is in response to your request for the views ofthe Department of Justice on S. 2117, the. National ChildhoodVaccine-Injury Compensation Act.\" For the reasons set forthbelow, the Department of Justice recommends against enactment ofthis legislation.S. 2117 would create a federal program to compensate personasuffering certain injuries occurring after the administration ofspecified childhood vaccines. We oppose the bill because, atbottom, no special justification has been proffered necessitatingan entirely new set of judicial procedures supplementing existingremedies provided by law. In addition, specific provisions ofthe bill, summarized below, are objectionable.The bill would supplement, but not replace, the existingtort system of determining liability. Under Section 2111(b), anindividual would have a choice of suing in tort or seeking compen-sation under the statutory program but could not seek recovery intort after a decision under the program. The extraordinary provi-sion of a choice of remedies with respect to injuries allegedlyincident to childhood vaccines but not other inuries compensablethrough tort litigation can only lead to confusion and duplicativelitigation.Since existing tort remedies remain available, untila decision is made or judgment is entered und9r the program, seeSection 2111(c), the bill could \"'emit resuLta inconestent withthose achieved after a full trial on the issues. We do not per-ceive any reason for giving litigants \"two bites at the apple.\"Also, while the very detailed provisions of the bill may beviewed as an attempt to narrow the issues in dispute, our exper-ience in the courts, including experience gained under the SwineFlu Program of 1976 (P.L. 94-380), indicates that the nature ofillnesses and the date of first onset of symptoms of the illnesseswould be hotly contested in many instances. The bill would deter-mine compensation based on the nature of the illnesses and dateof onset of symptoms. Thus, the detailed provisions of the billare not likely to achieve their apparent purpose of limitingdisputes before the courts. 297 293 It the bill were acceptable in principle, many of thespecific provisions would require amendment. For 4nstanceo 1.section 2113(d)(1) contemplates proceedings beforemagistrates or special masters. There is no.reason why judgesshould not exercise their judicial function in these proceedingsas in any other judicial proceedings seeking recoveries forpersonal injuries.The bill does pruvide that special masters or magistratesshall not \"exercise the ultimate judicial responsibility, whichshall be retained by the court, Section 2113(d)(1), and that apetitioner can seek a de novo determination by the court it heis dissatisfied with the magistrate or special master's findingsor conclusions and that the court may review the rulings on itsown motion.The duplicative proceedings permitted by the billare quite unlike magistrates' proceedings authorized under 28U.S.C. S 636(c), because the petitioner is compelled to consentto trial before a magistrate in the first instance and becausethe magistrate's determination is not binding on the petitioneror the court.Further, the responderit should have the sameright to appeal an arguably erroneous magistrate's determinationto a district court as does the petitioner.a 2.The bill contemplates ex parte proceedings. Section2113(b)(1).In the context of this legislation, the nature ofthose proceedings is vague. As drafted, the bill may turn outto bei unworkable administratively; in any event, a full hearingwoulu be important to permit fair determinations of the factualissues in those proceedings. 3.Section 2113(f)(1) states that a decision to providecompensation shall constitute an obligation of the United Statesand shall be backed by the full faith and credit of the UnitedStates.This obviously is intended to permit the general treasuryto be reached rather than merely limit recoveries to the trustfund created by the bill. If this were otherwise deemed desirable,it is not clear what effect the chosen language would have onpayments. 38-454 0 - 84 - 19298 294 4,Section 2111(e)(2) provides that an appellate court shall review the district court's decision to determine whether the findings are \"unsupported by substantial evidence.\" This is usually the standard applied to review of an administrative agency's findings rather than ro a courts findings. We doubt whether this standard should be utilized in thip legislation if district courts are to make the initial decisions.5.Section 2117 provides for affirmative suits. We assume that suits on behalf of the Secretary would be filed only if authorized by the Attorney General or his designee and that the Justice Department would represent the Secretary in all litiga- tion.It might be desirable to make this requirement explicit.6.Section 2117(a)(2) authorizes the district courts to refer the records of aertain proOeedings to the Secretary and to the Justice Department with recommendations with respect to investigations and/or commencement` of civil actions. This provi- sion is apparently unique. We are unaware of any other circum- stances where a court is permitted to interfere with the Exec- utive's prosecutorial and investigative prerogatives in such a manner, and see no reason why a court should be given 4is authority here.The Department of Justice recommends against enactment of this legislation for the reasons set forth above.The Office of Management and Budget has advised this Depart- ment that there is no objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of the Administration's program.

Nearing held: May 3, 1984 3 0 0 SENATOR HAWKINS', SENATOR HATCH, COMMITTEE.MEMBERS1 I am pleased o honor your request to contribute to the diverse. collection of.views'on S. 2117,'The National Childhood Vaccine InjuryAct, with this written teatime..1J or the hea-ing record.As the mother of Scott Grant who will have his 23rd. birthdayone month fro% tomorrow, the statements that follow are a reflectionof my husband Jim and my.views as we perceive S. 2117, based upon ourplait 23 years of personal experience. Not only from providing Scottwith round the clock care ever since he became incapacitated fromthe severe brain damage inflicted upon him by Parke Davis' DPT vaccineat Y3 months of age ... but from at least 10 years of litigation, whichinvolved more encounters with unscrupulous maneuvering by top vaccineofficials within 'the'govenmental vaccine regulatory agency and thispharmaceutical company than anything else.As desperately as we need compensation for Scott's permanentlydisabled condition, we cannot permit this to eliminate our moralobligations and commitment to continue to expose the whole truthabout DPT and exercise everything 'within our power to prevent anymore children from being maimed and killed from its use. And it isfor this pr.-ciae reason ... as well intended as q. 2..117 mey be ..we find it impossible to support it in its present state. This isof great disappointment and we deeply regret after waiting 2 longyears fbr the creation cf this crucially needed legislation, thatit is neces'ary for us to take this stand. What is most heartbreakingis the hundreds, perhaps thousands of additional vaccine damagedchildren that may have resulted by the continued use of thisadmittedly dirty-imperfect vaccine over the additional 2 year period. 301 297 Not to mention how may more years it will be forced upon ourinnocent children while the political game-playing continues.Because of S. 2117's' extreme length and ambiguous language,time nor apace will permit comment on its entirety ... and thefollowing reflects 'Nit a Tewof the flaws in this bill as weperceive it.f We cannot accept the repeated term that this bill has provisionsthat willcreate mandates for development of a asf er vaccine.With the past well established deceptive reputat-qon, thit permits them to continue to hurt children right and',left.One might say, instead of the. present vaccine hurting .fe5,000 ehildren each year ... it will be acceptable if 4,999get hurt with a different but not truly SAFE vaccine. It isour firm position that unless manufacturers iiiibsolutely /11forced to full accountability, they will never substantiallyimprove this vaccine. Full accountability, includes an obligationto carry adequate mal-practice insurance with the_p:amiums paid'fully out of their own pockets not the taxpayers'. Then, andonly then, will they, rapidly find a way to produce a SA l vaccine.With the assumption this bill adequately provides a mandate forall health care providers to report all adverse reactions; Again,with their past reputation in this regard we are NOT convincedthey will carry through with this responsibility, unless, a heavyand firm legal penalty for their noncompliance is enforced. At the very least, the title of a \"NO-FAULT\" compensation systemis an insult and painfully offending to the vaccine victims andtheir families, who certainly do not need salt poured into theiropen wounds, by a title, that absolves the very ones who hurt them. The special master or magistrate Shall be an attorney he willhave the powex to accept or reject any pe-ition ... there isnothing that qualifies him to make such determination by himselfand he could conceivably deny most claims ... the impact of whichwould permit the same 50 year old lies ... that severe reaction\"'are indeed very rare. 302 298 Wilma Oundy5923 Urban CourtArvada, Colorado 80004303-422-0598April 18, 1984Senator Paula Hawkins and Committee Members:As a victim of the swine flu vaccine, I welcome thif. opportunity.to share written testimony with you on S. 2117, the NationalChildhood Vaccine-Injury Comrensatioh Act of 1984.I am one of 46,000,000 Americana who heeded the government'spromotional program to stop the chain of contagion a \"killer\" disease in 1976 and was vaccinated for swine flu on November 26,1976.Three weeks later, my feet, legs, arms, hands and the leftside of my f1ce and tongue began .a3 turn numb, I felt as if I had been injected with povocaine. Besides the numbness, I felt extremely exhausted and weak.I spent the next three and one-half years going..frcm doctor todoctor and submitting to test after test before my illness was diacnosed in 1980 by Dr. Charles Poser as \"sensory\" Guillain-Barre'syndrome (GBS). There are, I've since learned, two types of GBS: the acute form in which the victim becomes paralyzed and, thesensory form in which the victim suffers sensory loss, weakness,fatigability and shakiness. A large percentage of victims withparalytic GBS recover; many victims of sensory GBS do not. The damage to the peripheral nervous system does not heal. It is the opinion of Dr. Poser that the damage I have suffered is permanentand thatI will not recover.Although Ian able to do only one-half of what I did prior totaking the vaccination, I feel I am among the \"fortunate\" victimsof swine flu vaccine. Many others are paralyzed, have lost the use of their hands, or suffer some other severe disability. My life philosophy embraces a commitment to helping others. Not 'just for my own sake, but in the hope I might be able to helpthese other victims who are severely handicapped, I have devotedmany hours over a period of several years to researching exhibitsdeveloped by the National Steering Committee for Swine Flu Plaintiffs,medical articles, and the claims and lawsuits of other swine fluvictims.It is with this background of personal experience,research, and commitment that I volunteered to testify beforeyour committee.Foremost,I want to commend you, Senator Hawkins and members of theLabor and Human Resources Committee, for swnsoring this legislation,and for the hours and hours elf study, writing, and discussion whichhave resulted in S. 2117. A national compensation bill for vaccine victims is acutely needed. There are several commendable features of S.2117, but space does not permit me to talk about them.Rather,I shall direct my comments on several points which Ibelieve should be elaborated or changed. 3r3 299 First,I shall elaborate on why I agree that pursing compensationfor vaccine injury through the courts is unsatisfactory. In1978, under provisions of the Swine Flu Act, I filed a routineclaim requesting compensation for my medical expenses and forthe hundredi of days of work I'd lost. After my claim wastechnically uenied because the Justice Department ignored it,I filed a lawsuit.At my trial in June, 1980, two neurologists testified I haveGuillain-Barre syndrome; five doctors testified my illness isdue to the swine flu vaccination, and four different objectivetests supported that opinion. The Justice Department calledone witness:Dr. James Austin of the Department of Neurologyat the University of Colorado Medical Center who testified he\"did not know what Mrs. Gundy's disease is, but whatever it is,it is not due to the swine flu shot.\" My suit, heard in the 10thJudicial District before Judge Sherman Finesilver, was denied.I appealed the decisions, and after three yeWrs of waiting, theappeal was also denied.Judge Finosilver's opinion in my suit set a nationwide precedentto deny liability unless the victim developed paralytic GBSwithin ten weeks of taking the inoculation. I have heard fromother victims who, like me, had a \"preponderance of the evidence\"on their side in their trial, but whose suit was denied.In the introduction to S. 2117, Senator Hawkinscomments that\"Our legal claims system is a slow, expensive, and uncertainprocess.\"Slow?Indeed.It has now been 7-1/2 years since Ifirst became ill. Not only have I received no compensation todate, but through the judicial Torts process, Iftever shall.Expensive?Yes.To date, expenses incurred in gy lawsuit againstthe Government is slightly over 517,000.Uncertain?No.I saynot uncertain, because the pursuit cf justice for swine flu vaccinevictims has proved quite certain: any claim or lawsuit that doesnot fall within the Government's established guidelines ofparalytic GAS develooed'within ten weeks, or prior to January 31,1977, will not be compensated.According to the latest statistics I've been able to get from theTorts office of the Justice Department, 4,075 Americans have filedclaims against the Government. Two-thirds of the claims filed,2,710, have been denied. Under the provisions of the Swine FluAct, 1,536 of those whose claims were denied have chosen to filelawsuits.Of the suits filed, many have been droo#ed or settledout of court for a small percentage of damages asked. Nationwide,of suits which have gone to trial to date, plaintiffs have won21, the Government 110 - a ratio of 1 in 5.5.The Government hasappealed almost all of the suits it lost add has won on appeal. 304 a 300 The 10-week cutoff date after which liability is denied was established by a study conducted by Dr. Lawrence Sdhonberger for CDC.This cutoff period has been the issue of numerous lawsuits. The \"smoldering\" theory of the etiology of GBS is held by many neurologists.They theorize that either the victim develops a \"smoldering\" case of GBS from the vaccine which is then precipi- tated by a virus or infection, or the vaccination affects the immune s,stem, .making the victim susceptible to catching the disease.Thus, a vaccine\u00b0 may develop GBS weeks or months after the vaccination.For medical dot .mentation on tnis poiht, I refer by Charles M.Poser and PetLr 0. Behan in Journal of Veuroimmoologi, 3, (1982) 27-41.Hence, the timeline gnia Tor occurrences of a reaction to a vaccine is NOT long enough.I call this to your attention because GBS may result from other types of vaccines, not just influenza. Moreover, some doctors speculate that other types of autoimmune diseases, evolving over a long period of time and in a manner similar to that describedfor GBD in the proceeding paragraph, may result from vaccinations.A second item in S. 2117 which concerns me is that I read time after tiridTrithe list of covered injuries the word \"acute.\" In my own experience, injury from a vaccine may be insidious, and greater recognition needs to be given to this point. I Was never \"acutely\" 'ill.At no time was I paralyzed, unconscious, suffering fromseizures, high fever, or pain. Yet,I suffer considerable disabili- ty because of the residual damage to my nervous system, whichcauses me to tire very easily to the point where I cannot function.I urge greater emphasis on chronic illness, and on sensory impair- ment or loss which may rosuaWEE inoculations.A third area in which I am uneasy about the provisions of S. 2117 is to absolve drug manufacturers of liability for the vaccine they produce.I understand your concern about the dramatic increase inthe cost of vaccine, but I question enacting a law that allows drug manufacturers to make and distribute a vaccine without any liability for its safety. That, in my opinion, is one reason why so much-of the swine flu vaccine was shot into people's arms with-out adequate testing and without proper safeguards for its purity. IfI.recall correctly, one provision of the Swine Flu Act wasthat the Government could sue the vaccine manufacturer if theybelieved the vaccine was defective. Proof that swine flu vaccine caused GBS was provided by experiments conducted in 1979-80 byDr. T. M. Phillips anDr. Edward Eyler. Monkeys inoculated with P-2 protein from the vaccine developed Experimental Allergic I., (FAN), the animal equivalent of GBS. Yet, to my knowledge, the government has sued no drug manufacturer. 301 Fourth,I am concerned that claims by petitioners will be decidedL7 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.This arrangement, it seems to me, has the same potential forpoliticalization as having a federal judge be the sole decisionmaker in suits against the government under provisions of theFederal Tort Claims Act. In my'opinion, the decision should bemade by a panel from the public sector, of doctors, lawyers andvaccine victims.Fifthly.,I am concerned there is no provision to compensatevictims of swine flu and other vaccines.I realize that the premise of S. 2117 is to compensate victimsof mandatory vaccines. However, a case can be made for those ofun who took the vaccine in the belief it was our civic duty tohelp break the chain of contagion of a killer disease. %So called\"herd immunity\" is the objective of any National immunbeationcampaign.Rut a majority of the public must be willing to takethe vaccine for this objective to be realized. As Robert Levine,chairman of Yale University's institutional review board and aprofessor of medicine states, \"Even though it's voluntary, itstill is in the interest of public health and the government.\"(Quoted from \"Compensation for Victims of Viccinee,\" by MarjorieHall, Science, Vol. 211, Feb, 1981).Quoting from the hill (Section 2101, a, 4) \"(4) because communi-cable disease is a national problem, because the primary thrustfor vaccination has come from the Federal GoVernment, and becausevaccine-related injuries which may tend to undermine the public'sconfidence in vaccination programs are a national concern, thereis a national need for, and responsibility to establish, anational vaccine-injury compensation program as a non-mandatoryalternative to the current tort system.\"Certainly the public's faith in government-sponsored vaccinationprograms has been tarnished. This lessening of confidence isunfortunate for we are always in eminent danger of a flu epidemicbecause of the antigenic shift in flu genes. Stephen H. Hall,writing in the November, 1983, issue of Science, comments:'Me shuffling of flu genes can give the-VITus-the genetic equiva-lent of five aces, creating a virulent hybrid.\"I envision the scenario when the next flu epidemic threatens:the Government will give a vaccination program, and nobody willcome.A bill to justly compensate all vaccine victims would ignite thespark to rekindle Americans' confidence in the government'sability to provide for the public health. 306 4 802 VAN'DE.RB I LT UNIVERSITYNASHVILLE.

Truly yours,74444442\"6\"\"4\"4Richard IMMUNIZATIONSBy Richard Moskowitz, M.D. For the past ten years or so, I have felt a deep and growing compunction againstgiving routine immunizations to children. It began with the fundamental belief thatpeople have the-right to make that choice for themselves, Soon I discovered that Icould no longer bring myself to give the inlections even when the parents wishedme to.At bottom, I have always felt that the attempt to eradicate entire microbialspecies from the biosphere must inevitably upset the balance of nature in fundamentalways that we Gal as yet scarcely imagine. Such concerns loom ever larger as newvaccines continue to be developed, seemingly for no better reason than that we havethe technical capacity to make them, and thereby to demonstrate our power, as acivilization, io manipulate the evolutionary process itself.Purely from the viewpoint of our own species, even if we could be sure thatthe vaccines were harmless, the fact remains that they are compulsory,that all childrenarc required to undergo them, without any sensitive regard for basic differences inindividual susceptibility, to say nothing of the wishes of the parents or the childrenthemselves.Most people can readily accept the fact that, from time to time, certain lawsmay be necessary for the public good that some of us strongly disagree with. But tieissue in this case involves nothing less than the introduction of foreign proteins oreven live viruses into the bloodstream of entire populations.For that reason alone, the public Is surely entitled to convincing proof, beyondany reasonable doubt. that artificial immunization is in fact a- safe and effectiveprOcedure. in no way injurious to health, and that the threat of the correspondingnatural diseases remains sufficiently dear and urgent to warrant mass inoculation ofeveryone, even against their will if necessary.Unfortunately, such proof has never been given; and, even if it could be,continuing to employ vaccines against diseases that are no longer prevalent or nolonger dangerous hardly qualifies as an emergency.Finally, even if such an emergency did exist, and artificial immunization couldbe shown to be an appropriate response to it, the decision would remain essentiallyapoliticalone, involving issues of public health and safety that are far too importantto be settled by any pure!y scientific or technical criteria. or indeed by anycriterialess authoritative than the clearly articulated sense of the community about to besubjected to it.For all of these reasons. I want to present the case against routine immunizationas dearly and forcefully as I can. What I have to say is not quite a formal theorycapable of rigorous proof or disproof. It is simply an attehipt to explain my ownexperience. a nexus of interrelated facts, observations. reflections, and hypotheseswhich, taken together, are more or less coherent and plausible and make intuitivesense to me.309 305 I offer them to the public in part because the growing refusal of parents tovaccinate their children is so seldom articulated or taken seriously. The fact Is thatwe have been taught to accept' vaccination as a sort of involuntary communion, asacrament of our own participation in the unrestricted growth of scientifi9 andindustrial technology, utterly heedless of the long-term consequences to the healthof our own species, let alone to the balance of nature as a whole. For that reasonalone, the other side of the case urgently needs to be heard. 1. ARE THE VACCINES EFFECTIVE?There is widespread agreement that the time period since the common vaccineswere introduced has seen a remarkable decline in the incidence and severity of thecorresponding natural infections. But the customary assumption that the decline isattribulable to the vaccines remains unproven, and continues to be seriously questionedby eminent authorities in the field. The incidence and severity of whooping cough,for example. had already begun to decline precipitously long before the pertussisvaccine was introduced 0), a fact which led the epidemiologist C. C. Dauer to remark,as far backas i943: If mortality from pertussis) continues to decline at the same rateduring the next is years, it will be extremely difficult to show statis.tically that [pertussis immuniation] had any effectin reducing mortalityfrom whooping cough (a).Much the same is true not only of diphtheria and tetanus, but also of TB,cholera,typhoid, and other common scourges of a bygone era, which bt-t-,an to disappeartoward the end of the nineteenth century, perhaps partly in response to improve-ments in public health and sanitation, but in any ase long before antibiotics, vaccines,or any specific medical measures designed to eradicate them (3).Reflectionssuch as these led the great microbiologist ReneDubos to observethat microbial diseases have their own natural history, indepe.1dent of drugs andvaccines, in whichasymptomatic infection and symbiosis arc far more common thanovertdisease: Itis barely recognized. but nevertheless true, that animals andplants, as well as men. can live peacefully with their most notoriousmicrobial enemies. The world is obsessed by the fact that poliomyelitiscan kill and maim several thousand unfortunate victims every year. Butmore extraordinarris the fact that millions upon millions of youngpeople become infected by polio viruses, yet suffer no harm from theinfection. The dramatic episodes of conflict between men and microbesare what strike the mind. What Is less readily apprehended is the morecommon fact that infection can occur without producing disease (4). Theprincipal evidence that the vaccines are effective actually datei from themore recent period, during which time the dreaded polio epidemics of the i94o'sand iuso's have never reappeared in the developed countries, and measles, mumps. 310 306 r.and rubella. which even a generation ago were among the commonest diseases ofchildhood, have become far less prevalent, at least in their dasic acute forms, sincethe triple MMR vacdne was introduced into common use.Yet how the vaccines actually accomplish these changes is not nearly as wellunderstood as most people like to think it is. The disturbing possibility that they actin some other way than by producing a genuine immunity is suggeste0y the factthat the diseases in question have continued to break out even in highly Iinmunizedpopulations. and that In such cases the observed differences in incidence and severitybetween immunized and unimmunized persons have tended to,be far less dramaticthan expected, and in some cases not measurably significant at airin a recent British outbreak of whooping cough, for example, even fully immu-nized children contracted the disease in fairly large numbers, and `the rates of seriouscomplications and death were reduced only slightly (5). In another recent outbreakof pertussis, 46 of the 85 fully Immunized children studied eventually contracted thedisease (6).In 1977, 34 new cases of measles were reported on the campus of UCLA, in apopulation that was supposedly 91 percent Immune. according to careful serologicaltesting (7). Another 20 cases of measles were reported in the Pecos, New Mexico areawithin a period of a few months In 1981, and 75 percent of them had been fullyimmunized, some of them quite recently (8). A surveyobf sixthgraders in a wellimmunized urban community revealed that about 15 percent of this age group arestill susceptible to rubelji, a figure essentially identical with that of the prevacdneera 1/49).Finally, although the overall incidence of typical acute measles in the U.S. hasdropped sharply from about 490,000 cases annually in the early 1969's to about ;o,000cases by 1974-76, the death rate remained exactly the same (in): and, with the peakincidence now occurring in adolescents and young adults, the risk of pneumonia anddemonstrable liver abnormalities has actually increased substantially, according to onerecent study, to well over 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively (11).The simplest way to explain these discrepancies would be to postulate that thevaccines confer only partial or temporary immunity, which sounds reasonable enough.given the fact that they are either live viruses rendered less virulent by serial passagein tissue culture, or bacteria or bacterial proteins that have been killed or denaturedby heat. such that they can still elicit an antibody response but no longer initiate thefull blown disease.Because the vaccine Is a \"trick,\" in the sense that it simulata the true or naturalimmune response developed in the course of recovering from the actual disease. it iscertainly realistic to expect that such artificial immunity will in fact \"wear off\" quiteeasily. and even require additional \"booster\" doss at regular intervals throughoutlife to maintain peak effectiveness.Such an explanation would be disturbing enough for most people. Indeed, thebasic fallacy inherent in it is painfully evident in the fact that there is no way to knowhow long this partial or temporary immunity will last in my given individual, or howoften it willkneed to be restimulated. because the answers to these questions dearlydepend oniprecisely the same individual variables that would have determined 311 307 whether or how severely the same person, unvaccinated, would have cons cted thedisease in the first place.In any case, a number of other observations suggest equally strongly that thissimple explanation cannot be the correct one. In the first place. a number ofinvestigators have shown that when a person vaccinated against the measles. forexample, again becomes susccntible to it, even repeated booster doses will have littleor no effect (12).In the second place. the vaccines do not act merely by producing pale or mildcopies of the original disease: all of them also commonly produce a variety of symptomsof their own. Moreover. in some cases. these illnesses may be considerably moreserious than the original disease. involving deeper structures. more vital organs. andless of a tendency to resolve spontaneously. Even more worrisome is the fact thatthey are almost always more difficult to recognize.Thus. in a recent outbreak of mumps in supposedly immune 'school-children.several developed atypical symptoms. such as anorexia, vomiting, and erythematousrashes. without any parotid involvement, and the diagnosis required extensive serol-ogical testing to rule out other concurrent diseases (1)). The snydrome of \"atypicalmeasles\" can be equally difficult to diagnose, even when it is thought of (14). whichsuggests that itis often overlooked entirely. In some cases, atypical measles can bemuch more severe than the regular kind, with pneumonia. petechiae, edema, andsevere pain jis). and likewise often goes unsuspected.In ally case, it seems virtually certain that other vaccinerelated syndromes willbe described and identified. if only we take the trouble to look for them. and thatthe ones we are aware of so far represent only a very small part of the problem. Buteven these few make it iess and less plausible to assume that the vaccines produce anormal. healthy immunity that 1.-ts for some time but then wears off, leaving thepatient miraculously unharmed and unaffected by the experience. 2. SOME PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH VACCINE-RELATEDILLNESS.would like now to present a few of my own vaccine cases, both to give a senseof theirti mety and chronicity, and to show how difficult it can be to trace them,and also to begin to address the crucial question that is too seldom even asked.namely. how the vaccines actually work, i.e. what effects they do in fact produce inthe human body.My first case was that of an 8-month old girl with recurrent feversn1 unknown origin. Ifirst saw here in January of 1917, a few weeksafter hor third such episode. These were brief. lasting 48 hours athut very intense. with the fever typically reaching los\u00b0 F. During these,ond epicxie. she was hospitalized for diagnostic evaluation. but herpediatrician found nothing out of the ordinary. Apart from these'pi odr% the child felt quite well. and appeared to be growing and1/41rkelo-ling normallyI could get no further information from the mother. except forthe fakt that the episodes had occurred almost exactly one month 312 308 apart; and, upon consulting-hercalendar, we learned that the firstepisode had come exactly one month after the last of her DPI injecLions, which had also been given at monthly Intervals. At thisoint,the mother remembered that the child had had similar febrile episodesimmediately after each injection, but that she had been instructed toignore them, inasmuch as they are \"common reactions\" to the vaccine.therefore gave the child a single oral dose of dilute homoeopathicDPT vaccine: and I am happy to report that the child has remainedwell since. with no further episodes of any kind.This case illustrates how homoeopithic remedies prepared from vaccines canused for dicionosis as well as treatment of vaccinerelated illnesses, which, no matterhow strongly they are suspected, might otherwise be almost impossible to substantiate.Secondly, because fever is the commonest known complication of the pertussisvaccine, and inasmuch as the child seemed quite well between the attacks, herresponse to the vaccine appeared to be a relatively strong and healthy one, disturbingbecause of Its recurrence and periodicity, but In any Case relatively simple to cure, asindeed it proved to be. But one cannot help wondering what happens to the vaccineIn thoSe tens of millions of children who show no obvious response to it at all.Since that time.have seen at least half a doilin cases of children with recurrentfevers of unknown origin, associated with a variety of other chronic complaints,chiefly Irritability, temper tantrums, and increased susceptibility to colds, tonsillitis,and car infections. which were similarly traceable to the pertussis vaccine, and whichresponded successfully to treatment with the homoeopathic DPT nosode. indeed, t would have to say. on the basis of that experience, that the pertussis vaccine is probably one of the major causes of recurrent fevers of unknown origin in smallchildren today. My second case was that of a 94-monthold girl, who presentedacutely with a fever of roc\u00b0 F.. and very few other symptoms. Like thefirst, this childhad hadtwo similar episodes previously, but at irregularintervals: and the parents, who felt ambivalent about vaccinations ingeneral. had given her only one dose of theanvaccine so far, althoughthe first episode occurreda fewweeks afterwards.I first saw the child in June of 1978. The fever remained high andunremitting for 48 hours, despite the usual acute remedies and sup.port ive measures. A CBC revealed a white count of 12,loo per cu. mm..with 43 percent lymphocytes, 11 percent monocytes. 25 percent neutrophils (many with toxic granulations), 20 percent bands (also withtoxic granulations), and I percent metamyelocytes and other immatureforms. When I asked a pediatrician about these findings. \"pertussis\"was his immediate reply. After a single oral dose of homoeopathic DPI'vaccine. the fever came down abruptly within a few hours, and thechild has remained well since. This case was disturbing mainly because of the hematological abnormalities.which were in the leukcmoid range, together with the absence of any cough ordistinctive respiratory symptoms, which suggested that introducing the vaccine directlyinto the blood may actually promote deeper or more systemic pathology than 313 309 allowing the pertussi9 organism to set up typical symptoms of local inflammation atthe normal portal of entry.The third case was a 5yearold boy with chronic lymphocyticleukemia. whom I happened to see in August of 1978. while visiting anold friend and teacher, a family physician with over 4o years' experience.Well out of earshot of either the boy or his parents, he told me thatthe leukemia had first appeared following a DPTvaccination, and that,although he had treated the child successfully with natural remedieson two previous occasions, with shrinking of the liver and spleen toapproximately normal size, and dramatic Improvement in the bloodpicture, full relapse had maned soon after each successive DPT booster.The idea that vaccinations might also be implicated in some cages of childhoodleukemia was shocking enough in itself, but it also completed the line orreasoningopened up by the previous case. For leukemia Is a cancerous process of the blood andthe blood-forming organs, the living, the spleen, the lymph nodes, and the bonemarrow, which are also the basic anatomical units of the immune system. Insofar asthe vaccines are capable of producing serious complications at all, the blood and theimmuneorgans would certainly be the logical place to begin looking for them,But perhaps evenmore shocking to me is the fact that the boy's own physiciandared not communicate his suspicion of vaccine-related illness to the parents, let aloneto the general public. It was this case that convinced me, once,and for all, of the (need for serious, public discussion of our collected experiences with vaccinrelatedillness. precisely because rigorous experimental proof will require years of investigationand a firm public commitment that has not even been made yet.I will now present two cases from my limited experience with MMR vaccine.In December of 198o 1 saw a 3.year.old boy with a 4week historyof loss of appetite, stomach aches, indigestion, and swollen glands. Thestomach pains were quite severe, and often accompanied by belching,flatulence, and explosive diarrhea. The nose was also congested, andthe lower eyelids were quite red. The mother also reported someunusual behavior changes, such as extreme untidiness, \"wild\" and\"noisy\" playing, and waking at 2a.m. to get into bed with the parents.The physical examination was unremarkable except for somelarge, tender left posterior auricular and suboccipital nodes. and markedenlargement of the tonsils. I then learned that the child had receivedthe MMR vaccine in October, about 2weeks before the onset ofsymptoms, with no apparent reaction to it at the time. I gave the childa single dose of the homoeopathic rubella vaccine.and the symptomspromptly disappeared within 48 houn.In April 1981. the parents brought him back for a slight fever, andanother ;week history of intermittent pain in and behind the rightear. stuffy nose. etc. On examination, the whole right side of the faceappeared to be swollen, especially the cheek and the angle of the law.The right eye was red and injected. He responded well to acutehomoeopathic remedies. and has remained well since.This boy was typical of my rubella vaccine cases. At an intervalof a few weeksafterthe MMRvaccine, which is about the same as the normal incubation period of 38-454 0 - 84 - 20314 810 rubella, a rather nondescript illness develops, which becomes subacute and rathermore severe than rubella in the same age group. with, e.g., abdominal or joint painsand marked adenopathy, but no rash. Usually the is suspected because ofthe characteristic posterior auricular and suboccipital nodes. and confirmed by afavorable response to the homoeopathic rubella ngsode.As I read over this case, I am struck by the possibility that his second illness,and especially the parotid enlargement, may have represented continuing activity ofthe mumps component of the vaccine, Inasmuch as I did not have the triple MMRnosode, but only those derived from the individual components. We must thereforealso consider the probability that a variety of \"mixed\" or composite syndromes mayoccur. representing the patient's responses to two or all three of the vaccine com-ponents. either simultaneously or over time. !In April of 1981 I first saw a 4-year-old boy for bilateral chronicenlargement of the posterior auricular nodes, which were also occa'sionally tender. The mother had noticed the swelling for about oneyear, :during which ..me he had become more susceptible to variousupper respiratory infections. none of than especially severe, The motherhad also noticed recurrent parotid swelling at irregular intervals overthe same time period, which began shortly after the MMR vaccine wasgiven at the age of 3,At the time of the first visit, the child was no ill: and, becausethe mother was about 2 months pregnant at the title, I elected toobserve the child and do nothing if possible until the pregnancy wasover. He did develop a mild laryngitis in the last trimester, whichresponded well to bed rest and simple homoeopathic remedies.In April of 1982, he came down with acute bronchitis. I noticedthat the posterior auricular nodes were once again swollen and tender.and I decided to give him the homoeopathic rubella nosode at thatpoint. The cough promptly subsided, and the nodes regressed in sizeand were no longer tender. Two weeks later. however, he retumdwith a noticeably hard, tender swelling on the outside of the rightcheek. near the angle of the law, and some pain on chewing or openingthe mouth. A single dose of the homoeopathic mumps nosode wasgiven. and the child has been well since.i.In this case also. we see the subacute pattern of the disease. with a strongtendency to chronicity and increased susceptibility to weaker. low-grade responses.in contrast to the vigorous. acute responses typically associated with diseases like themeasles and the mumps when acquired naturally. 3. HOW DO THE VACCINES WORK? Itis dangerously misleading, and. indeed. the exact opposite of the. truth todaim chat a vaccine makes us \"immune\" or protects us against an acute disease. if infactitonly drives the disease deeper into the interior and causes us to harbor itchronically. with the result that our responses to it become progressively weaker, andshow less and less tendency to heal or resolve themselves spontaneously. 315 311 What I propose, then, is simply to investigate as thoroughly and objectively aswe can how the vaccines actually work inside the human body, and to begin by payingattention to the implications of what we already know, In particular, I would like toconsider in detail the process of falling ill with and recovering from a typical acutedisease. such as thc'measles. in contrast with what we can observe following theadministration of the measles vaccine.We all know that measles Is primarily a virus of the respiratory tract, bothbecause itis inhaled by susceptible persons upon contact with infected droplets inthe air, and because these droplets are produced by the coughing and sneezing of aperson with the disease.Once inhaled by a susceptible person, the measles\" virus then undergoes a longperiod of silent multiplication, first in the tonsils, adenoids, and accessory lymphoidtissues of the nasopharynx; later in the regional lymph nodes of the head and neck;and eventually, several days later. it passes into the blood and enters the spleen, theliver, the thymus, and the bone marrow, the ':visceral\" organs of the immune systemfib). Throughout this \"incubation\" period, which lasts from to to 14 days, the patientusually feels quite well, and experiences few or no symptoms OABy thethat the first symptoms of measles appear, circulating antibodies arealready detectable in the blood, and the height 'of the symptomatology coincideswith the peak of the antibody response (t8). In other words. the \"illness\" is simplythe definitiVe effort of the immune system to clear the virus from the blood. Equallynoteworthy is the fact that the virus is eliminated by sneezing and coughing, i.e., viathe same route through which it entered in the first place.It is evident that the process of mounting an acute illness like the measles, no lessthan recovering from it involves a general mobilization of the entire immune system,including inflammation of 'he previously sensitized tissues at the portal of entry,activation of leukocytes and macrophages, liberation of the scrum complementsystem, and a host of other mechanisms, of which the production of circulatingantibody is only one, and by no means the most important.Such a splendid outpouring leaves little doubt that such illnesses are in fact thedecisive experiences in the normal physiologic maturation of the immune system asa whole in the life of a healthy child. For not only will the child who recovers fromthe measles never again be susceptible to it (19); such an experience also cannot failto prepare the individual to respond even more promptly and effectively to anyinfections he may acquire in the future. The ability to mount a vigorous acuteresponse to organisms of this type must therefore be reckkoned among the mostfundamental requirements of general health and wellbeing.In contrast. when an artificially attenuated virus such as measles is injecteddirectly into the blood. bypassing the normal portal of entry, at most a briefinflammatory reaction may be noted at the injection site. or in the regional lymphnodes: but there is no \"incubation period\" of local contact at the normal portal ofentry. and consequently very little possibility of eliminating the virus via the sameroute.Even more important is the fact that the virus has been artificially \"attenuated,\"so that it will no longer initiate a generalized inflammatory response. or indeed any316 312 of the nonspecific defense mechanisms that help us to respond to infection generally._By \"tricking\" the body In this fashion, we haye accomplished what the entire immunesystem seems to have evolved in order to prevent: we have placed the virus directlyinto the blood, and given It free and Immediate access to the major Immune organsand tissues. without any obvious way of getting rid of it.The result Is. indeed, the production of circulating antibodies against the virus.which can be measured in the blood; but the antibody response now occurs as anIsolated technical feat, without any generalized inflammatory response. or any notice.able improvement in the general health of the organism. Exactly the opposite. infact! the price that we have to pay for those antibodies is the persistence of virus,elements in the blood for prolonged periods of time. perhaps permanently. which inturn presupposes a systematic weakening ofour ability to mount an effective response.not only to measles. but also to other acute infections as well.Far-frbm,producing a genuine immunity, then, the vaccines may act by actuallyinterfering with or suppressing the irrumune response as a whole, In much the same waythat radiation, chemotherapy, and corticosteroids and other anti inflammatory drugsdo. Artificial immunization focuses on antibody production. a single aspect of the immuneprocess. and disarticulates it and allows It to stand for the whole, In much the sameway as chemical suppression of an elevated blood pressure Is accepted as a validsubstitute for a genuine cure of the patient whose blood pressure has risen. Worst ofall. by making It difficult or impossible to mount a vigorous, acute response toinfection, artificial Immunization substitutes for it a much weaker, chronic response.with little or no tendency to heal itself spontaneously.'Moreover, adequate models already exist for predicting and explaining whatsorts of chronic disease are likely to result from the chronic, longterm persistence ofviruses and other foreign proteins within the cells of the Immune system. It has longbeen known that live viruses, for example, are capable of surviving or remaininglatent within the host cells for years, without continually provoking acute diseaseThey do so simply by attaching their own genetic material as an extra particle or\"episome\" to the genome of the host cell, and replicating along with it, which allowsthe host cell to continue Its own normal functions for the most part. but imposes onit additional instructions for the synthesis of viral proteins (2o).Latent viruses of this type have already been implicated in three distinct typesof chronic disease. namely. recurrent or episodic acute diseases. such as herpes. shingleswarts. etc. kzi): 2) \"flow Anrus- diseases, i.e., kuru. subacute sclerosing panencephaliti)kSSPE). and possibly GuillainBarre syndrome k22): and 3) tumors. both benign and malignantIn any case. the latent virus survives as a dearly \"foreign\"' clement within thecell. which means that the immune system must continue to try to make antibodiesagainst it. insofar as it can still respond to it at all. Because the virus is now permanentlyincorporated within the genetic material of the cell, these antibodies will now haveto be directed against the cell itself.rite persistence of live viruses or other foreign antigens within the cells of thehost therefore cannot fail to provoke autommune phenomena. because destroying the 317 318 infected cells is now the only possible way that this constant antigenic challenge canbe removed from the body. Since routine vaccination introduces live viruses andother highly antigenic material into the blood of virtually every living person, it isdifficult to escape the conclusion that a significant harvest of autoimmune diseasesmost automatically result.Sir Macfarlane Burnet has observed that the components of the immune systemall function as if they were collectively designed to help the organism to discriminate\"self- from \"non.self.\" i.e., to help us to recognize and tolerate our own cells, and toidentify and eliminate foreign or extraneous substances as completely as possible (24).This concept is exemplified not only by the acute response to infection, but also bythe rejection of transplanted tissues, or \"homografts,\" both of which result in thecomplete and permanent removal of the offending substance from the body,if Burnet is correct, then latent viruses, autoimmune phenomena, and cancerwould seem to represent different aspects of the same basic dilemma, which theimmune system can neither escape nor resolve, For all of them presuppose a certaindegree of chronic immune failure, a state in which It becomes difficult or impossible forthe body either to recognize its own cells as unambiguously its own, or to eliminateits parasites as unequivocally foreign.In the case of the attenuated measles virus, it Is not difficult to Imagine thatintroducing it directly into the blood would continue to provoke an antibody responsefor a considerable period of time, which is doubtless the whole point of giving thevaccine: but that eventually, as the virus succeeded in attaining a state of latencywithin the cell, the antibody response would wane, both because circulating antibodiescannot normally cross the cell membrane, and because they arc also powerful irrunu-nosuppressive agents in their own right (2c).The effect of circulating antibody will thereafter be mainly to keep the viruswithin the cell, i.e., to carnal le to prevent any acute inflammatory response, untileventually, perhaps under circumstances of accumulated stress or emergency, thisprecarious balance breaks down, antibodies begin to be produced in large quantitiesagainst the cells themselves, and frank autoimmune phenomena of necrosis and tissuedestruction supervene. Latent viruses, in this.sense, are like biological \"time bombs,\"set to explode at an indeterminate time in the future (26).Auto immunc diseases have always seemed obscure, aberrant, and brzarre, becauseitis not intuitively obvious why the body should suddently begin to attack anddestroy its own tissues. They make a lot more sense, and, indeed, must be reckonedas \"healthy.- if destroying the chronically infected cells is the only possible way ofeliminating an even more serious threat to life, namely, the persistence of the foreignantigenic Lhallenge within the cells of the host.'I umor inrmation could then be understood as simply a more advanced stageof chronic immune failure. according to the same model. For, as long as the host Issubjected to enormous and unremitting pressure to make antibodies against itself,that response will automatically tend to become less and less effective.Eventually. under stress of this magnitude, the autoimmune mechanism couldeasily break down to the point that the chronically infected and genetically trans.formed cells, no longer dearly \"self- or \"non-self,\" begin to free themselves from the 318 314 normal restraints of \"histocompatibllity\" within the architecture of the surroundincells, and begin to multiply autonomously at their expense.A tumor could then be described as \"benign\" Insofar as the breakdown o!histocompatibility remains strictly localized to the tissue of origin. and \"malignant.Insofar as it begins to spread to other cell types, tisues, and organs. even in mornremote areas. Malignancy might simply represent the reactivation of the virus frorrits latent phase into a more acute mode, albeit with less inflarrlirlatiOn and more tisucdestruction than the original wildtype infection.If what I arnlying turns put to be true, then what we have done by artifiaa,immunization is essentially to trade off our acute. epidemic diseases of the past centuryfor the weaker and fax less curable chronic diseases of the peseta. with thenamortiable suffering and disability,ln doing so, we have also opened up limIdesevolutionary possibilities for the future of ongoing in vivo genetic recombinationwithin the cells of the race. 4. THE INDIVIDUAL VACCINES RECONSIDERED.I want next to consider each of the vaccines on an individual basis. in relationto the infectious diseas-s from which they are derived.The virusesadministered in a single intramuscular injection at about 15 months of age. Subsequentreimmunization is no longer recommended. except for young women of childbearingage. in whom the risk of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is thought to warrant it.even though the effectiveness of reimmunization is questionable at best.Prior to the vaccine era, measles. mumps. and rubella were reckoned amongthe -routine childhood diseases.\" which most school-children contracted before theage of puberty, and from which nearly all recovered, with permanent. lifelongimmunity. and no complications or sequelae.But they were not always so harmless. Measles. In particular. can be a devastatingdisease when a population encounters It for the first time. Its Importation from Spain.for instance, undoubtedly contributed to Cortez' conquest of the great Aztec Empire:whole villages were carried off by epidemics of measles and smallpox. leaving only asmall remnant of cowed, superstitious warriors to face the bearded conquistadores fromacross the sea27). in more recent outbreaks among isolated. primitive peoples. the g*case fatality rate from measles averaged 20 to 30 percent (28).In both these soulled \"virgin.soil\" epidemics. not only measles but also polioand many other similar diseases take their highest toll of death and serious complications among adolescents and young adults. healthy and vigorous people in theprime of He. and leave relatively unharmed the group of school.age children beforethe age of puberty (29).This means that the evolution of a disease such as measles from a dreaded killerto an ordinary disease of childhood presupposes the development of nonspecific orherd- immunity in young children, such that. v.hen they are finally exposed to thedisease, it activates defense mechanisms already prepared and in place. resulting inthe long incubation period and the usually benign. sellimited course described above. 319 315 Under these circumstances, the rationale for wanting to vaccinate young childrenagainst measles is limited to the fact that a very small number of deaths and seriouscomplications have continued to occur, chiefly pneumonia, encephalitis, and the rarebut dreaded subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), incidence of i per ioo,000 cases (3o). Pneumonia, by far the commonestcomplication, is usually benign and self limited, even without treatment (31); and,even in those rare cases in which bacterial pneumonia supervenes, adequate treatmentis currently available.By all accounts, then. the death rate from wildtype measles is very low, theincidence of serious sequelae is insignificant, and the general benefit to the child whorecovers from the disease, and to his contacts and descendants, is very great. Conse-quently, even if the measles vaccine could be shown to reduce the risk of death orserious complications from the disease. It still could not justify the high proloability ofauto-Immune diseases, cancer, and whatever else may result from the propagation oflatent measles virus in human tissue culture for life,Ironically. what the measles vaccine certainly has done is to reverse the historicalor evolutionary process to the extent that measles is once again a disease of adolescentsand young adults (p). with a correspondingly higher incidence of pneumonia andother complications. and a general tendency to be a more serious and disabling diseasethan it usually is in younger children,As for the claim that the vaccine has helped to eliminate measles encephalitis, Imyself, in my own relatively small general practice, have already seen two childrenwith major seizure disorders which the parents clearly ascribed to the measles vaccine,although they would never have been able to prove the connection in a court oflaw, and never even considered the possibility of compensation.Such cases therefore never make the official statistics, and are accordingly omittedfrom conventional surveys of the problem. Merely injecting the virus into the bloodwould naturally favor a higher incidence of deep or visceral complications affectingthe lungs, liver, and brain, for which the measles virus has a known affinity.Tho caw lot immunizing against mumps and rubella seems a fortiori even moretenuous. for exactly the same reasons. Mumps Is also essentially a benign, self limiteddisease in children before the age of puberty, and recovery from a single attackconfers lifelong, immunity. The principal complication is meningoenczphalins, mildor subLlinival tomb of which are relatively common, although the death rate isextremely lowand sequelae are rare.The mumps vaccine is prepared and administered in much the same way as themeasles. usually in the same infection; and the dangers associated with it are likewisekomparable. Again like the measles, mumps too is fast becoming a disease of adoles-tnts and voting adults k ia), age groups which tolerate the disease: much less well. Thechief Lomplication is acute epididymo-orchitis, which occurs in 30 to 40 percent ofthe males affected past the age of puberty, and usually results in atrophy of the testicleOn the affected side k is.); but it also shows a strong tendency to attack the ovary andthe pancreas.Ior all of these reasons, the greatest favor we could do for our children wouldbe to expose them all to the measles and mumps when they are young, which would320 316 not only protect them Igainst contracting more serious forms of these diseases whenthey grow older, but wo.:9 also greatly assist in their immunological maturation withminimal risk. I need hardly add that this is very dose to the actual evolutiOn of thesediseases before the MMR vaccine was introduced.The same discrepancy is evident in the case of rubella, or \"German measles,\"which in young children is a disease so mild that it frequently escapes detection tit)).but in older, children and adults not infrequently produces arthritis, purpura. andother severe, systemic signs (37), The main impetus for the development of the vaccinewas certainly the recognition of the \"congenital rubella syndrome CRS),\" resultingfrom damage to the developing embryo in utoo during the first trimester of pregnancy(38), and the relatively high incidence of CRS traceable to the rubella outbreak of1964But here again, we have an almost entirely benign, self-limited disease transformed by the vaccine into a considerably less benign disease of adolescents and youngadults of reproductive age, which is, ironically, the group that most needs to beprotected against it, Moreover, as with measles and mumps, the simplest and mosteffective way to prevent CRS would be to expose everybody to rubella in elementaryschool: reinfection does sometimes occur after recovery from rubella, but much lesscommonly than.after vaccination ( ;9),The equation looks somewhat different for the diphtheria and tetanus vaccines.First of all, both diphtheria and tetanus are serious, sometimes fatal diseases. evenunder the best of treatment; this is especially true of tetanus, which still carries aMortality of dose to ;o percent,Furthermore. these vaccines are not made from living diphtheria and tetanusorganisms, but only from certain \"toxins\" elaborated by them; these poisonoussubstances are still highly antigenic, even after being inactivated by heat. Diphtheriaand tetanus \"toxoids\" therefore do not protect against infection per se, but only againstthe systemic action of the original poisons, in the absence of which both infectionsare of minor importance clinically.Consequently. it is easy to understand why parents might want their childrenprotected against diphtheria and tetanus, if safe and effective protection were avail-able. Moreover. both vaccines have been in use for a long time, and the reportedincidence of serious problems has remained very low, so that there has never beenmuch public outcry against them.On the other hand. both diseases are quite readily controlled by simple sanitarymeasures and careful attention to wound hygiene; and, in any case. both have beensteadily disappearing from the developing countries, since long before she vaccineswere introduced.Diphtheria now occurs sporadically in the United States. often in areas withsignificant reservoirs of unvaccinated children. But the claim that the vaccine is\"protective\" is once again belied by the fact that, when the disease does break out.the supposedly \"susceptible\" children are in fact no more likely to develop clinicaldiphtheria than their fully immunized contacts. In a igloo outbreak in Chicago, forexample, the Board of Health reported that 26 percent of the cases had been fully.immunized, and that another 12 percent had received one or more doses of the 321 317 vaccine and showed scrological evidence of full ingnunity; another 18 percent hadbeen partly immunized, according to the same criteria (go),So, once again. we are faced with the probability that what the diphtheriatoxoid has produced is not a genuine immunity to diphtheria at all, but rather somesort of chronic immune tolerance to it, by harboring highly antigenic residues some-where within the cells of the immune system, presumably with long-term suppressiveeffects on the immune mechanism generally.This suspicion is further aggravated by the fact that all of the DPT vaccines arealum-precipitated and preserved with Thiomersal, an organomercury derivative, toprevent them from being metabolized too rapidly, so that the antigenic challengewill continue for as long as possible. The fact is that we do not know and have nevereven attempted to discover what actually becomes of these foreign substances, oncethey are inside the human body.Exactly the same problems complicate the record of the tetanus vaccine, whichalmost certainly has had at leant some impact in reducing the incidence of tetanus inits classic acute form, yet presumably also survives for years or even decades as apotent foreign antigen within the body, with long-term effects on the immunesystem and elsewhere that are literally incalculable.\"Whooping cough,\" much like diphtheria and tetanus, began to decline as aserious epidemiological threat long before the vaccine was introduced. Moreover,the vaccine has not been particularly effective, even according to its proponents; andthe incidence of known side.effects is disturbingly high.The power of the pertussis vaccine to damage the central nervous system, forexample. has received growing attention since Stewart and his colleagues reportedan alarmingly high incidence of encephalopathy and severe-convulsive disorders inBritish children that were traceable to the vaccine (41). My own cases, a few of whichwere reported above, suggest that hematological disturbances may be even moreprevalent, and that. in any case, the known complications almost certainly represent asmall fraction of the total.In any case. the pertussis vaccine has become controversial even in the UnitedStates, where medical opinion has remained almost unanimous in favor of immuni-ations generally, and several countries, such as West Germany, have discontinuedroutine pertussis vaccination entirely (42).Pertussis is also extremely variable clinically, ranging in severity from asympto.matic. mild, or inapparent infections, which are quite common actually. to very rarecases in young infants less than s months of age, in whom the mortality is said toreach 40 percent k43). Indeed. the disease is rarely fatal or even that serious in childrenover a year old. and antibiotics have very little to do with the outcome (44).A good deal of the pressure to immunize at the present time thus seems to beattributable to the higher death rate in very young infants. which has led to theterrifying practice of giving this most dearly dangerous of the vaccines to infants at 2months of age. when their mothers' milk would normally have protected them fromall infections about as well as it can ever be done (4s), and the effect on the stilldeveloping blood and nervous system could be catastrophic.322 318 For all of these reasons, the practice of routing pertussis immunization shouldbe discontinued as quickly as possible, and more studies done to assess and compensatethe damage that it has already done.Poliomyelitis and the polio vaccines present an entirely different situation. Thestandard Sabin vaccine is trivalent, consisting of attenuated, live polioviruses of eachof the three strains associated with poliomyelitis; but it is administered orally, in muchthe same way as the infection is acquired in nature. The oral or non Injectable route.which leaves the recipient free to develop a natural immunity at the normal portalof entry, i.e., the GI tract, would therefore appear to represent a considerable safetyfactor.On the other hand, the wildtype poliovirus produce no symptoms whatsoeverin other oo percent of the people who contact it, even under epidemic conditions(46); and, of those people who do come down with recognizable clinical disease.perhaps only i or 2 percent ever progress to the full-blown neurological picture ofpoliomyelitis,\" with its characteristic lesions in the anterior horn cells of the spinalcord or medulla oblongata WAPoliomyelitis thus presupposes peculiar conditions of susceptibility in the host.even a specific anatomical susceptibility, since, even under epidemic. conditions, thevirulence of the poliovirus is so low, and the number of cases resulting in death orpermanent disability was always remarkably small (48).Given the fact tHat the poliovirus was unbiquitous before the vaccine wasintroduced, and could be found routinely in samples of city sewage wherever it waslooked for (0), it is evident that effective, natural immunity to poliovirus was alreadyas dose to being universal as it an ever be, and a fortiori no artificial substitute coulc1,ever equal or even approximate that result. Indeed, because the virulence of thepoliovirus was so low to begin with it is difficult to see what further attenuation ofit could potsibly accomplish, other than to abate as well the full vigor of the naturalimmune response to it.For the fact remains that even the attenuated virus is still alive. and the peoplewho were anatomically susceptible to it before are still susceptible. to it now. Thismeans. of course, that at least some of these same people will develop paralytic poliofrom the vaccine (5o), and that the others may still be harboring the virus in latentform, perhaps within those same cells.The only obvious advantage of giving the vaccine, then, would be to introducethe population to the virus when they are still infants, and the virulence is normallylowest anyway (51); and even this benefit could be more than offset by the danger ofweakening the immune response, as we have seen. In any case. the whole matter ,sclearly one of enormous complexity. and illustrates only too well the hidden dangersand miscalculations that are inherent in the virtually irresistible attempt to beat natureat her own game. to eliminate a problem that cannot be eliminated. i.e., thesusceptibility to disease itself.So even in the case of the polio vaccine, which appears to be about as safe asany vaccine ever can be, the same fundamental dilemma remains. Perhaps the cla%will come when we can face the consequences of deliberately feeding live jibliovruse,to every living infant. and admit that we should have left well enough alone. and 323 319 addressed ourselves to the art of healing the sick when we have to, rather than tothe technology of eradicating the possibility of sickness. when we don't have to. andt.an't possibly succeed in any case. S. VACCINATIONAND THE PATH OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY. In conclusion. I want to go back to the beginning. to the essentially politicalaspects of vaccination. that oblige us all to reason and deliberate together aboutmatters of common concern, and to reach a clear decision about how we choose tolive. I have stated my own views regarding the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines,and I hope that others of differing views will do the same.That is why I am deeply troubled by the atmosphere of fanaticism with whichthe vaccines are imposed on the public, and serious discussion of them is ignored orstifled by the medical authorities, as if the question had already been settled defini-tively and for all time. In the words of Sir Macfarlane Burnet. It is our pride that in a civilized country the only infectious diseas6which anyone is likely to suffer are either trivial or easily cured byavailable drugs The diseases thatIlled In the past have in one way oranother been render 2d impoterft. and. in the process. general principlesof control have been developed which should be applicable to anyunexpected outbreak in the future 621. Quits apart from the truth of these claims, they exemplify the smugness andself righteousness of a profession and a society that worships its own ability tomanipulate and control the processes of nature itself. That is why. as Robert Men-delsohn has said,we arc quick to pull the trigger, but slow to examine the consequenc es of our an ions kcilindeed. one would have to say, methodically slow. In for example. theAmerican Audemv of iediatrics. which had been charged by Congress with respon-sibility to formulate guidelines for Federal compensation of \"vaccination-relatediniuries.issued the following eligibility restrictions: Compurnat ion should be made available to any child or youngperson under the age of 18 years. or a contact of such person0( any age. who suffers a major reaction to a .It tine mandatedfor school entry or continuation in school in his or her state ofresidence.'rat ban should hart Oren previously recognized as a possible consequenceof theI a..inc given 1chin,racion should hair occurred no more than 0) days following theinununizatwn 1;4). I hesse result nuns would atiromatica!ly exclude all of the chronic diseases, orindeed anything other than the very few adverse reactions that have so far beenidentified. which clearly represent only a tiny fraction of the problem.324 320 Still less can either the government or the medical establishment be consideredignorant of the possibility that lurks in every parent's mind and heart. namely, thatthe vaccines cause cancer and other chronic diseases. Precisely that possibility wasraised by Prof. Robert Simpson of Rutgers in a 1976 seminar for science writers.sponsored by the American Cancer Society: Immunization programs against flu, measles. mumps. polio. andso forth. may Actually be seeding humans with RNA to form latentproviruses in cells throughout the body. These latent proviruses couldbe molecules in search of diseases: when activated. under proper con.dawns, they could cause a variety of diseases. including rheumatoidarthritis. multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus. Parkinson sdisease. and perhaps cancer kis). Unfortunately. this is the sort of warning that very few people are willing orable to hear at this point, least of all the American Cancer Society or the AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics. The fact is, as Dubos points out, that all of us still want tobelieve in the \"made.\u00b0 regardless of the evidence. Hie faith in the magical power of drugs often blunts the critical senses.and comes dose at timesito a mass hysteria. involving skientists andlaymen alike. Men warn miracles as much today as in the past. If thevdo not loin one of the newer cults. they satisfy this need by worshipingat the altar of modern science. This faith in the magical power of drugsis not new. It helped to give medicine the authority of a priesthood.and to recreate the glamor of ancient mysteries co).The lora of eradicating measles or polio has come to seem attractive to ussimply- because the power of medical science makes it seem technically possitge: weworship every victory of technology over nature. iust.as the bullfight celebrates thetriumph of human intelligence over the brute beast.That is why we do not begrudge the drug companies their enormous profitsand Id gladly volunteer our own bodies and those of our children for weir lateste%per If Ile nts. Vaccination is essentially a religious sacrament of our \"c7I.Vh participatlOrin the miracle. a veritable auto date in the name of modern civilization itself.Nobody in his right mind would seriously entertain the idea that. ii we couldsomehow eliminate. one by one. measles and polio and all the known diseasesmankind. we would be any the healthier for it. or that other even more seriousdiseases would not quickly take their place.Still less would a rational being suppose that the illnesses from which he sufferedw-entities- somehow separable from the patients who suffer them. and thatwith the appropriate chemical or surgical sacrament. this separation can literally be.a riled out.let these arc precisely the \"miracles\" we are taught to believe in. and theidolatries to which we aspire. We prefer to forget the older and simpler truths. thatthe propensity or susceptibility to illness is deeply rooted in our biolo0Cal natureand that the phenomena of disease are the expression of our own life energy. trvincto overcome whatever it is trying to overcome. trying. in short. to heal itself. 325v 321 The myth that wecan find technical solutions for all human ailments seems attractive at first. precisely because it bypasses the problem of healing, which is a genuine miracle in the sense that it can Always fail to occur. We arc all genuinely at risk of illness and death atevery moment: no amount of technology can change that.Yetthe mission of technical medicine is precisely to try to change that: to stand at all times in the front lines against disease, and to attack and destroy it whenever and wherever it shows itself.That is why, with all duerespect, I cannot have faith in the miracles or accept the sacraments of Merck. Sharp, and Dohme and the Center for Disease Control, prefer to stay with the miracle of life itself, which has given us illness and disease, but also the arts of medicine. and healing, through which we can acknowledge and experience our pain and our vulnerability, and sometimes, with the grace of God and the help of our fellowmen, an awareness of health and wellbeing that transcendsall boundaries. Thatis my religion; and while I would willingly share it, I would not force it on anyone.

Because I myself have very little research training or experience, I amdoubly curious why such tests were not carried out long ago.A number of scholars have certainly entertained these ideas before. as I indicatedin the text. and even considered them publidy. The only obstade that I can see totaking them seriously is that they are \"heretical,\" that it would be impossible evento take the time to study them without a \"paradigm shift\" of some magnitude (i). i. How Effective Are the Vaccines?I argued in the text that if the vaccines act by suppressing the ability of theorganism to mount an effective acute inflammatory restonse, then we can no longeraccept a simple drop in the incidence of the acute disease as a measure of true immunity.I also argued that the mere presence of circulating antibody cannot suffice either,because the diseases in question do continue to break out even in serologically highly'immune' populations.What stlikes me as a far more interesting and relevant measurement is thedegree to which the vaccine \"protects\" against the acute disease when the latteractually does break out. This could be determined relatively easily by studying theincidence and morbidity of each disease in fully and partly-immunized populations,as compared with those of their non-immunized neighbors. Such a study would stillhave nothing to say about the possibility of irrununo-supprezion. But it would at leastgive a truer perspective on the ability of the vaccines to do what their proponentsstem to want them to do.I cannot resist pointing out that such research obviously requires a sizeablecohort of un-immunized people, which is now being provided by those parents whohave refused to immunize their children, despite the concerted efforts of the medicaland public health authorities to intimidate and punish them. The same result coul.iof course be achieved much more efficiently by simply making the vaccines optiol,as they are in West Germany, Sweden. the United Kingdom, and some other places,which would allow the experimental and control groups to select themselves. Ourfrantic efforts to secure loci percent compliance with the present mandatory program328 324 evidently succeed only in making such studies impoisible.A closelyrelated type of study would be to measure the effectiveness of reiriotwwation at varying intervals after the original course. In this cast, there would betwo control groups:i) the same unirrimunized cohort, as before; and2) a group of children previously vaccinated, whose parents decided not to givethem the \"booster\" dose.This study would also measure the incidence and morbidity of the acute disease whenit does break out. rather than simply the circulating antibody titer. which is probablyfar less relevant.My conjecture. based on the preliminary studies I cited in the text, is that bothprimary and booster vaccinations tend to give considerably less protection against thecontsponding acute disease when it does break out than the simple drop in incidence,or the rise in antibody titer, would intiate.Both of these studies could also be carried out in suitable animal populations.using vaccines developed against diseases peculiar to each species. such as caninedistemper. leptospirosls. and the like, inasmuch as what we are concerned withincludes the effectiveness and mode of action of the vaccines in general.A third possibility would be to investigate the relationship between circulatingantibody and \"immunity\" in the above sense. This could be done by measuringantibody titer periodically in a large pooled sample. and then retrospectively com-paring baseline titers in an immunized group that subsequently developed the diseasewith another immunized group that was exposed to the disease but did not developit. Both could then be compared with the corresponding nonimmunized groups,who would be expected to show no measurable titers at all prior to exposure, 2, How Do the Vaccines Act? As I argued in the text. the problem with all of these studies is that theysystematically ignore the crucial possibility that the vaccines may act immunosuppressively, and may therefore produce or at least promote a variety of obscure chronicdiseases over long periods of time. This is why the \"effectiveness\" of the vaccinescannot really be studied in isolation without first understanding their mode of actionin a more comprehensive fashion.indeed, the issue of effectiveness is actually misleading, insofar- as it leads is tofocus on the typial acute disease, rather than the broad spectrum of biologial effectsthat an be associated with .bacteria, viruses, and the vaccines derived from them, aspectrum that includes latent, subdinical, and chronic phenomena as well. We certainly know of situations in which inability to develop acute disease represents theexact opposite of good health, i.e., the consequences of chronic immune tolaanurather than true immunity.At the crudest level, then, we need to study the effects of the vaccines, bothacutely and longterm. on various clinical and laboratory. par-arneters of health indcbease. in the case of the pertuscas vaccine, for example. we need good prospective 329 325 .studies on the incidence and severity of various hematological and CNS abnormalitiesover time, following the administration of the single vaccine at the usual time (andat routine intervals before and after), This could be done simply and inexpensivelyby performing CRC's, brief neurological exams, and behavioral assessments on thesame self-selected groups of immunized and un-immunized children,Another method would be to follow certain obvious clinical variables at the timeof the normal well-child and other pediatric visits, such as the incidenceandseverity(,.of acute and recurrent URI, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, otitis noxlia, cervical adenopathy,and the like, in both immunized and un-immunized children over a period of years.The same experimental format should also make it possible to sort out thevarious patterns of chronic morbidity following each individual vaccine, Again. thecrucial importance of the un-immunized cohort becomes ol?,vious, With regard topertussis. for example, my clinical experience to date strongly suggests that theimmunized group will have a significantly higher incidence and morbidity fromchronic and recurrent infections, with higher rates of complications and disability,such as myringotomies, hearing loss. etc,A longterm study could then follow these same children through older child-hood and adolescence. to determine the incidence and morbidity of various chronic(*arcs, such as eczema, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, ulcerative colitis, multiple.,.,?sclerosis, and other Idiopathic degenerative, CNS; or connective-tissue diseases, as wellas mental retardation, hyperactivity, school and behavior problems, convulsive dis-orders, leukemia, and other forms of cancer, Once again, my suspicion is that theimmunized group would show a significantly higher increase in the incidence andmorbidity in all these categories. I hope I'm wrong, but I don't think I am.Another interesting and useful study would be to measure the effect of thecommon vaccines on the incidence and morbidity of other acute infections to whichthe individual was definitely or probably exposed (influenza, hepatitis, genital herpes,Colorado tick fever. etc.). The point here would be to see if the vaccination processhas any effect on the capacity of the immune system to deal with acute infectiongenerally, which seems quite probable.In this case there would be two control groups:i) one group of children not previously immunized (against measles, mumps, orwhatever), who were subsequently exposed to influenza, hepatitis, or someother acute infection; and2) a group of similar children who contracted arid recovered from acute measles,mumps, or whatever, some time before their exposure to influenza, hepatitis.etc.Again, my ccoecture is that both groups, while perhaps no les likely to contract thesecond disease, would show significantly less acute and chronic morbiclitti as a result ofIt.Along these same lines, it would not be very difficult to design some goodanimal studies investigating the possibility of immunosuppression by the vaccines. Thiscould be done by measuring leukocyte and macrophage activity both in vivo and Invitro, in response to various challenges, such as exposure to unrelatedinfections.allergens, and chemicals. Various liver-function tests, as well as the ability of thespleen 18 454 08421,3 3 0 326 and bone marrow to respond to hemorrhage and blood transfusion could also befollowed. Finally, the ability of both immunized and unimmunized animals to rejecthomografts could be measured quite easily.Careful cytogenetic studies could also be made, to show the effects of vaccinationon karyotype and chromosome morphology, beginning with typical \"target\" cells forwhich the vaccine in question has a known affinity (e.g., liver parenchymal cells inhepatitis, parotid acinar cells nasal mucosa in measles). Carefulvirological studies of these same cells should also make it possible to recover or atleast demonstrate the existence of eptiomes or viral nudeoprotein moieties withinthe DNA or RNA of the host, which would confirm the suspicion of latency andchronic infection, at least in the case of the live vaccine.But, whichever studies are done, the point is that the technology to do themalready exists; and the only thing that prevents their' from being done is our ownideological resistance to the selevident truth that vaccines are not simply \"wonderdrugs\" that produce specific antibodies and nothing more. !Y.:4 complex, biologically-active substances whose effects on the human organism urgently need to be investi-gated.

Some comments resulting from our review follow: Sec. 2111(d) (3) nothing included (or referred to) in the Vaccine -InjuryTable in section 2114(a), nor excluded from such table, shall beadmissible for any purpose whatsoever in any action in tort in any tiiii17Federal court for damages for any vaccine-related injury.Nor shall any matter included in, referred to, or excluded from, suchtable be afforded any weight by the decider of fact in any such action in tort.(4) nothing included (or referred to) in the review list insection 2114(c), nor excluded from such list, shall be admissiblefor any purpose whatsoever in any action in tort in any state orFederal court for damages for any vaccine-related injury ..(underscorings here and elsewhere in this letter are ours). Comment:While the words in the above sections might make legal sense, in ourjudgment, they violate cOmmon sense, since \"nothing ...in the ...table ..nor excluded from [the table] shall be admissible ..6H means thatnothing in the universe remains to be admissible since all in the universe is either in or out of the table. The same applies to the review list. 33 380 Sec. 2112(a)(3) the first symptom or manifestation of the onset (or.signifi-cant aggravation) of any such illness, disability, injury-or condi-tion occurred within the reayisite time the Teccine-Iniary Table undpr section211-4, regardless of 'whether or not such symptom or manifestationwas recorded as such within that period Current:Even a casual examination of the relevant medical literature will showthat a significant number of cases of vaccine indyced \"illnesses, disabilities,injuries or conditions listed in the Vaccinil-Injury Table under section 2114\"occurred later than \"the requisite time period after vaccine administrationset forth in the Vaccine-Injury Table under section 2114.\" These cases(with delayed onset of symptoms and manifestations of vaccine induceddamage)are excluded from relief under provistvis of S. 2117.

Comment:Senator Hawkins wrote in her statement published in the CongressionalRecord (17 November 1983, page 16612, and quoted at length in paragraph 3of thiS letter):Increased vaccine costs threaten the childhood immunization programin another way: Dramatic increases in price mean that fewer children.will be immunized. According to a spokesperson of one of the threeprivate pharmaceutical companies currently manufacturing the pertussis 335 :--' 331 vaccine, the cost of a 16-dbse vial of pertussis vaccine increasedfrom $4.67 to $42 in June of this year. That represents anunbelievable tenfold increase. The company had only two alternatives:either to discontinue manufacturing the vaccine or to increase Its.price radically.There is nothing in S. 2117 that precedes or follows Sec. 2110 thatshows that establishment of a \"uniform or variable annual surcharge on themanufacturer of each vaccine listed in the table in sectio: 2114\" will notresult in further increases in vaccine costs--cost increase that even noware characterized by Senator Hawkins as \"dramatic\" and that .. meanthat fewer children will be immunized.\" Sec. 2114(b)(6).(C).1n assessing whether a petitioner has suffered a chronicor long-term complication or sequela of an encephalopathy (acute)under this title, the Court shall consider, in addition to otherappropriate factors, whether and, if so, when and to what extent thepetitioner has suffered the following effects: seizures, convulsions,or focal neurological signs; developmental delay, learning disabilities,or mental retardation; hyperkinesis; paralysis or Other motor ormuscular impairments; sensory impairment or loss; unusual or extremeemotional dysfunction. Comment:What is an unusual or extreme emotional dysfunction? The answerdepends upon the observer and the reporter of'the dysfunction. This is akind of loophole through which many escape.leaps have been made in the pastand through which many more escape-leaps will be made in the future. Sec. 2114(c)(1) Not later than three years after the date of enactment ofthis title, the Secretary shall complete a review of all relevantmedical and scientific information ( including information ootainedfrom the studies required under paragraph (6)) on the nature,circumstances, and extent of the relationship, if any, betweenpertussis-containing vaccines (including whole cell, extracts, andspecific antigens) and the following illnesses or conditions:(A) hemolytic anemia . .. 336 332 Comment:We believe that a worthwhile evaluation of a recent review involvingthe Secretary [of the Department of Health and Human Services] can be derivedfrom your words given at the Open Meeting, Pertussis and Pertussis Vaccines,Interagency Group to Monitor Vaccine Development, Production and Usage,Rockville, Maryland, 26 April 1983. Before that group, you began your state-ment with \"We are given ten minutes to present a point of view on a subjectthat is so complex, that ten minutes cannot begin to do justice to it\" andnear the close of your statement with \"We think the whole notion of causationthat has been applied to the SIDS analysis would never survive scrutiny if itwere applied to any other situation. It would never--you would never applythe same test of causation to cigarette smoking or air pollution control ...and-yet you have been willing to go back and make your best effort to findout what the reactions are there and to find out what the risk factors are and to not require proof beyond any possible doubt.\" (For your convenience, a copy of the full text of your statement and comments are attached to thisletter.) So much for the quality of reviews that \"the Secretary shallcomplete ..
