Treatment protocols are integrative in nature, combining the most suitable therapies to address the individual patient's needs. Naturopathy is a distinct type of primary care medicine that blends age-old healing traditions with scientific advances and current research. Naturopathy is guided by a unique set of principles that recognize the body's innate healing capacity, emphasize disease prevention, and encourage individual responsibility to obtain optimal health. Naturopathy emphasizes on cleansing, healing and strengthening of the body which is achieved by a systematically planned prescription of a combination of therapies which are carefully selected as per the clinical condition of the person. These seven principles guide the therapeutic methods and modalities of naturopathic medicine. First Do No Harm - primum non nocere Naturopathic medicine uses therapies that are safe and effective. The Healing Power of Nature - vis medicatrix naturae The human body possesses the inherent ability to restore health. The physician?s role is to facilitate this process with the aid of natural, nontoxic therapies. Discover and Treat the Cause, Not Just the Effect - tolle causam Physicians seek and treat the underlying cause of a disease. Symptoms are viewed as expressions of the body?s natural attempt to heal. The origin of disease is removed or treated so the patient can recover. Treat the Whole Person - tolle totum The multiple factors in health and disease are considered while treating the whole person. Physicians provide flexible treatment programs to meet individual health care needs. The Physician is a Teacher - docere The physician?s major role is to educate, empower, and motivate patients to take responsibility for their own health. Creating a healthy, cooperative relationship with the patient has a strong therapeutic value. Prevention is the best ?cure? - praevenire Naturopathic physicians are preventive medicine specialists. Physicians assess patient risk factors and heredity susceptibility and intervene appropriately to reduce risk and prevent illness. Prevention of disease is best accomplished through education and a lifestyle that supports health. Wellness - Salus Establish or re-establish health and well-being.
