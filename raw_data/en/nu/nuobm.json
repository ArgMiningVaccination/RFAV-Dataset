Immunizations are an important and safe way to protect children and adults from serious illnesses. \"I know many Nova Scotians right now are focused on protecting themselves and their loved ones from COVID-19 and I'd like to encourage them to take this time to also be aware of the vaccines that are available for a number of other serious diseases,\" said Dr. Gaynor Watson-Creed, deputy chief medical officer of health. \"Vaccines lower the risk of infection and help us develop immunity to many diseases like whooping cough, measles and others. Back-to-school season is a good reminder to check your records and get any needed vaccines for you and your children. As much as possible, we are asking Nova Scotians to take the necessary steps to reduce additional communicable disease circulating during this time.\" Infants should receive vaccines listed in Nova Scotia's Routine Immunization Schedule. Before starting school, children between the ages of four and six should receive a booster of Tdap-IPV vaccine to protect them against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough and polio. They may also need a second dose of MMRV vaccine if they had not received it at 18 months to protect against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox. Youth in grade 7 receive hepatitis B, meningococcal quadrivalent and Tdap vaccines at school-based clinics. Clinics were offered earlier this summer for grade 7 students who did not receive these vaccinations last school year. Additional clinics will be available this fall for the grade 7 immunization program and for those students entering grade 8 who have not received them. Families will receive information from their school in the coming weeks about these clinics. Parents may always contact their local public health office to learn more about the recommended vaccination schedule and to book vaccinations covered by public health. Adults born in 1970 or later who have not received two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine should be immunized. Adults should also receive a booster dose to protect against diphtheria and tetanus every 10 years, and where appropriate, pertussis. Pregnant women should receive a dose of Tdap with every pregnancy. Anyone with high-risk conditions may require additional doses and may be eligible for additional vaccines.
