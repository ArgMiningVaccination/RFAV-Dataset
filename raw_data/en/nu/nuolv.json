As with skincare ranges, more and more of us are becoming allergic or sensitive to these chemicals. The more we can make our own products therefore, the more control we gain over our own health and wellbeing. The other issue is cost. Many hair care products and scalp treatments are fiercely expensive - as well as often being ineffective - so using natural recipes can save you money as well as help protect your long term health! Remember - as with your skin - the condition of your hair and scalp are very much a reflection of your general wellbeing. Hair growth/loss and condition can be a real barometer to certain nutritional deficiencies - and a real stress indicator. Holistic advice for hair loss As far as the reasons behind hair loss are concerned - these can vary between men and women. Gradual receding hair and hair loss on men can be determined by genetic male pattern baldness, although sudden hair loss can still be related to nutritional deficiencies and stress. For women, thinning hair and hair loss can be attributed to a more complicated range of reasons - from hormonal imbalances and menopausal symptoms to protein and amino acid deficiencies, stress, damage from harsh chemical hair treatments and even intestinal parasites. Whatever the cause, a Nutritional Therapist or Naturopath could help you identify the root cause of the problem holistically. There are certain herbs and nutrients that can help treat hair loss - even in relation to male pattern baldness and alopecia. These symptoms often require a multi-factored approach - as they will usually arise from a number of different issues coming together simultaneously. Learning to read and act on these symptoms may also help you prevent more serious long term health problems in the future. Top tips for natural for hair care - Don't wash your hair too often! Washing your hair strips out the natural oils that cover the scalp, and work their way down into the hair shaft. If you wash your hair daily you may find that your hair will become brittle, or your scalp will begin to dry out and flake - especially if you use harsh synthetic shampoos. Try and wash your hair twice a week maximum. - Try and let your hair dry naturally at least some of the time! This means your hair will be less likely to dry out and become brittle and damaged by the heat. There is also a body of evidence building to suggest that hair dryers emit a significant amount of EMR (Electro Magnetic Radiation) which may be linked to health problems such as headaches and the growing incidence of brain tumours. (Mobile phones being another possible factor). - Use a natural bristle brush and brush your hair regularly. Harsh inflexible plastic brushes often snap the hair off. Natural bristle brushes can help by encouraging the natural oil from the hair follicle to be drawn down the hair shaft which helps to condition and protect. Brushing the hair also encourages the circulation of blood to the hair follicle - where the base of the hair is rooted into the skin. This in turn will also help stimulate new hair growth. - Use shampoos that are free of Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS free) - a chemical foaming agent that may be linked to allergic reactions and other health problems. - Do not brush the hair when wet as it's more elastic and fragile and can snap off more easily. - HERBS: Saw Palmetto: Scientific studies show us that Male Pattern Baldness is at least in part caused by DHT (Dihydrotestosterone) which is a by-product of testosterone. This is thought to shrink and kill the hair follicles. The less that reaches them the less damage will occur. The most popular drug \"Finasteride\" works by inhibiting the production of the enzyme \"5 alpha reductase\" - which converts testosterone to DHT. The herb Saw Palmetto does almost the same thing. Studies of the herb show that a 160 mg dose taken morning and evening - but only with a high quality herb - can have a powerful effect without the side-effects of certain medication taken for the same issue. Two other helpful herbs to look into include Nettles and Pygeum. - NUTRIENTS : Zinc and Essential Fatty Acids are the most important nutrients when it comes to hair loss and poor hair condition, although other nutrient deficiencies can be an issue too. Zinc can also help prevent DHT getting to the hair follicles - a 60 mg dose for 6 months is recommended for men already suffering from male pattern baldness. Essential Fatty Acids, especially rich in GLA, such as Flaxseed, Blackcurrant and Evening Primrose Oil, @ 500 mg morning and evening - will also help improve hair density and condition within 6-8 weeks. - GREEN TEA: Again - to help male pattern baldness, as it helps to inhibit the production of 5 alpha reductase, the enzyme that allows the DHT to cause the damage. - Ayurvedic Medicine can have a positive effect on hair thinning and loss for women. This type of condition is seen as being caused by a \"whole body imbalance\", brought about by too little rest, high stress, smoking and too much alcohol, combined with poor nutrition. Improved nutrition, and the use of herbs such as GOTU KOLA to calm the nervous system and FENUGREEK POWDER, topically combined with unsweetened coconut milk - to encourage new growth, are all advocated - as is massage. Scalp massage (with Sesame Seed Oil) to soothe the scalp and reduce heat, and foot massage and general body massage to increase relaxation and regeneration.
