The National Park Service cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this country and the world. The NPS core values are a framework in which the National Park Service accomplishes its mission. They express the manner in which, both individually and collectively, the National Park Service pursues its mission. The NPS core values are: \u00b7Shared stewardship: We share a commitment to resource stewardship with the global preservation community . \u00b7Excellence: We strive continually to learn and improve so that we may achieve the highest ideals of public service. \u00b7Integrity: We deal honestly and fairly with the public and one another. \u00b7T radition: We are proud of it; we learn from it; we are not bound by it. \u00b7Respect: We embrace each other's differences so that we may enrich the well-being of everyone. The National Park Service is a bureau within the Department of the Interior. While numerous national park system units were created prior to 1916, it was not until August 25, 1916, that President Woodrow Wilson signed the National Park Service Organic Act formally establishing the National Park Service. The national park system continues to grow and comprises more than 400 park units covering more than 84 million acres in every state, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. These units include, but are not limited to, national parks, monuments, battlefields, military parks, historical parks, historic sites, lakeshores, seashores, recreation areas, scenic rivers and trails, and the White House. The variety and diversity of park units throughout the nation require a strong commitment to resource stewardship and management to ensure both the protection and enjoyment of these resources for future generations. The arrowhead was authorized as the official National Park Service emblem by the Secretary of the Interior on July 20, 1951. The sequoia tree and bison represent vegetation and wildlife, the mountains and water represent scenic and recreational values, and the arrowhead represents historical and archeological values. Foundation Document2 Introduction Every unit of the national park system will have a foundational document to provide basic guidance for planning and management decisions\u2014a foundation for planning and management. The core components of a foundation document include a brief description of the park as well as the park's purpose, significance, fundamental resources and values, other important resources and values, and interpretive themes. The foundation document also includes special mandates and administrative commitments, an assessment of planning and data needs that identifies planning issues, planning products to be developed, and the associated studies and data required for park planning. Along with the core components, the assessment provides a focus for park planning activities and establishes a baseline from which planning documents are developed. A primary benefit of developing a foundation document is the opportunity to integrate and coordinate all kinds and levels of planning from a single, shared understanding of what is most important about the park. The process of developing a foundation document begins with gathering and integrating information about the park. Next, this information is refined and focused to determine what the most important attributes of the park are. The process of preparing a foundation document aids park managers, staff, and the public in identifying and clearly stating in one document the essential information that is necessary for park management to consider when determining future planning efforts, outlining key planning issues, and protecting resources and values that are integral to park purpose and identity . While not included in this document, a park atlas is also part of a foundation project. The atlas is a series of maps compiled from available geographic information system (GIS) data on natural and cultural resources, visitor use patterns, facilities, and other topics. It serves as a GIS-based support tool for planning and park operations. The atlas is published as a (hard copy) paper product and as geospatial data for use in a web mapping environment. The park atlas for Valles Caldera National Preserve can be accessed online at: http://insidepark atlas.nps.gov/. 3 Valles Caldera National PreservePart 1: Core Components The core components of a foundation document include a brief description of the park, park purpose, significance statements, fundamental resources and values, other important resources and values, and interpretive themes. These components are core because they typically do not change over time. Core components are expected to be used in future planning and management efforts. Establishment of Valles Caldera National Preserve Valles Caldera was first established in 2000 as an unprecedented national experiment in public land management through the creation of the Valles Caldera T rust. The Valles Caldera T rust was a wholly-owned government corporation overseen by a board of trustees appointed by the president of the United States. Through the Valles Caldera T rust, the U.S. Congress sought to evaluate the efficiency, economy, and effectiveness of decentralized public land management and ecosystem restoration. This 15-year experiment in public land management continues to contribute to the national dialogue on the role of protected areas for long-term economic and environmental sustainability along with innovative approaches to place-based and science-based adaptive management. On December 19, 2014, Valles Caldera National Preserve was designated as a unit of the national park system. After a brief transition period, the National Park Service assumed management of the preserve on October 1, 2015. Brief Description of Valles Caldera National Preserve Valles Caldera is located in the center and at the top of the Jemez Mountains in north-central New Mexico. The 88,900-acre preserve encompasses almost all of the volcanic caldera within a single almost square area mostly surrounded by the Santa Fe National Forest. The Pueblo of Santa Clara shares a boundary with the preserve along the northeast rim of the caldera. Bandelier National Monument is an adjacent neighbor to the southeast, and one of the three Manhattan Project National Historical Park sites is nearby in Los Alamos. Most visitors access the preserve through the Valle Grande via the main entrance from New Mexico State Route 4, which runs along the inside of the southern rim of the caldera. Santa Fe and Albuquerque are a one- to two-hour scenic drive from the main entrance, placing the preserve within a manageable driving distance for about half of New Mexico's population. The preserve is located in the Jemez volcanic field at the intersection of two major fault systems, the Rio Grande Rift and the Jemez Lineament. This volcanic field has been active for more than 14 million years, but the current 12- to 15-mile-wide circular caldera depression was created by a spectacular volcanic eruption about 1.25 million years ago. Since that time, an additional 15 eruptions and magmatic intrusive events have created numerous volcanic domes within the caldera, including the major central resurgent dome, Redondo Peak, which is 11,254 feet high. The caldera is dormant, but not extinct, and still displays signs of volcanic life with hot springs and boiling sulphuric acid fumaroles. The unusual geologic and landscape characteristics of Valles Caldera led to its designation as a Natural National Landmark in 1975. The juxtaposition of large grassland meadows, or valles in Spanish, surrounded by rounded forest-covered volcanic domes provides the distinctive natural landscape that led to the name of Valles Caldera. The high-elevation ecosystems, ranging from 8,000 to 11,254 feet high, combine abundant rainfall, mixed-conifer forests, and deep rich soils to support a great diversity of animals, plants, fungi, and other organisms including herds of several thousand elk and healthy populations of mountain lions, bears, and coyotes. Foundation Document4 For thousands of years American Indians have used the caldera for hunting all sizes of game, small mammals and waterfowl, fishing, collecting an abundance of seeds, nuts, and berries, and gathering various plants for medicine and ceremonies. The signature resource for these indigenous peoples was obsidian. This high-quality volcanic glass gathered at extensive quarries in and near the caldera yielded valuable materials for spear points, arrowheads, knives, and scrapers. Obsidian artifacts from the last 12,000 years are abundant throughout the preserve and are found in ancient quarries, campsites, and even seasonally occupied small villages. Through scientific analysis, it is known that obsidian tools found across the United States were made from obsidian gathered at Valles Caldera, demonstrating the significance of this source and illustrating the extensive geographic ranges used by past hunter-gatherers, and perhaps indicating extensive trade of this high-value toolstone. Throughout prehistory and continuing today, this landscape has supported hunting and gathering to supplement agricultural subsistence. Numerous American Indian tribes and pueblos in the region have deep historic and cultural connections to the caldera that are expressed today through ceremonial activities, rich oral histories, and sacred traditions. Valles Caldera also chronicles the history of New Mexico's enchantment and exploitation\u2014from 19th century land use after the T reaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and sheep grazing under the partido system to subsequent cattle grazing, timber harvesting, and geothermal exploration. Beginning as a land grant in 1860, private ownership was held by a series of four families. The early name, Baca Location No. 1, was established at the beginning of the Cabeza de Baca era (1860-1899), and the lands were used for sheep grazing. During the Otero era (1899-1917) sheep grazing was increased, supplemented by ventures into sulphur mining and tourism at a location known as Sulphur Springs on the land grant's western boundary . Sheep grazing peaked and then was replaced by cattle ranching during the Bond era (1917-1962). The last private owners (1962-2000) were the Dunigan family, who continued cattle operations while pursuing diversified ventures such as exploration of geothermal potential, movie filming, raising thoroughbred horses, and recreational fishing and elk hunting. Although logging had begun in the 1930s, it was dramatically increased in the early 1960s by non-landowners who held rights to the timber. By the time the Dunigans were able to halt the clear-cut logging in the early 1970s, the overwhelming majority of old-growth forests had been cut and more than 1,000 miles of logging roads had been built through the forests. The preserve offers a landscape in which to explore the dynamics of high- elevation ecosystem stability and resilience in the context of changing climate conditions. Although the natural beauty of the caldera has persisted, the land-use practices of the 19th and 20th centuries, including overgrazing, clear-cut logging, and road building, have left a legacy of unhealthy forests, riparian damage, degraded wetlands, and reduced stream function. Numerous wildlife species were extirpated from the area as well. T oday's approach to ecological restoration builds on the lessons learned from this history and seeks to regain balance between human uses and natural processes. The preserve is an ecosystem in recovery . Major wildfires in 2011 and 2013 burned 60% of the preserve, and today the contrast in recently burned areas between old-growth forest and dense, second-growth forests provides a compelling demonstration of the value of landscape restoration to promote biotic integrity and biodiversity, while improving watershed function and reducing the potential for future catastrophic wildfires. 5 Valles Caldera National PreservePark Purpose The purpose statement identifies the specific reason(s) for establishment of a particular park. The purpose statement for Valles Caldera National Preserve was drafted through a careful analysis of its enabling legislation and the legislative history that influenced its development. The preserve was established when the enabling legislation adopted by Congress was signed into law on December 19, 2014 (see appendix A for enabling legislation). The purpose statement lays the foundation for understanding what is most important about the preserve. Located in the Jemez Mountains of north-central New Mexico, Valles Caldera Natio Nal Preser Ve protects, preserves, and restores ecosystems and cultural landscapes within an outstanding example of a volcanic caldera for the purpose of education, scientific research, public enjoyment and use, and cultural continuity. Foundation Document6 Park Significance Significance statements express why a park's resources and values are important enough to merit designation as a unit of the national park system. These statements are linked to the purpose of Valles Caldera National Preserve and are supported by data, research, and consensus. Statements of significance describe the distinctive nature of the park and why an area is important within a global, national, regional, and systemwide context. They focus on the most important resources and values that will assist in park planning and management. The following significance statements have been identified for Valles Caldera National Preserve. (Please note that the sequence of the statements does not reflect the level of significance.) 1. Valles Caldera possesses exceptional value in illustrating and interpreting massive explosive volcanic eruptions, caldera formation, and the functioning of active geothermal systems. Valles Caldera is one of the world's best examples of an intact volcanic caldera and is considered the worldwide \"type locality\" for caldera resurgence. 2. Valles Caldera is a place where one can directly experience pre-agricultural heritage and reflect on inconspicuous cultural landscapes where hunting and gathering were practiced successfully for more than 10,000 years. Past peoples across the continent were drawn to Valles Caldera to utilize its rich geologic deposits of high quality obsidian for tools and weapons, making this location one of the most significant cultural obsidian sources in North America. T o this day, the caldera is used by local pueblo and tribal peoples and is cherished by more than two dozen American Indian groups. 3. The land use history of Valles Caldera encapsulates the story of early Spanish and Mexican settlement across the present-day American Southwest and the socio-political shifts that occurred when the territory was annexed by the United States at the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848. Previously known as Baca Location No. 1, Valles Caldera exemplifies the legacy of how the establishment, utilization, and changing ownership of Spanish and Mexican land grants transformed the Southwest. 4. Valles Caldera's unusual setting\u2014high elevation, caldera topography, unfragmented habitats, and key hydrologic role at the top of the watershed\u2014presents a dynamic learning landscape for the scientific study and restoration of ecosystem processes that are recovering from three centuries of human disturbances and challenged by contemporary and future climate change. 5. Valles Caldera's distinct topographic mosaic of expansive valley meadows, lush forested volcanic domes, meandering valley streams, and old growth Ponderosa pine groves are in striking contrast to the arid New Mexico landscapes at lower elevations. With caldera vistas from rim to rim, elk and other wildlife viewing, dark night skies, winter skiing, excellent hunting and fishing opportunities, and backcountry solitude, the landscape provides extraordinary year-round recreational opportunities and visitor experiences. 6. Valles Caldera National Preserve was first established in 2000 as an unprecedented national experiment in public land management through which the U.S. Congress sought to evaluate the efficiency, economy, and effectiveness of decentralized public land management. The 15-year experiment continues to contribute to the national dialogue on the role of protected areas for long-term economic and environmental sustainability and innovative approaches to place-based and science-based adaptive management.7 Valles Caldera National PreserveFundamental Resources and Values Fundamental resources and values (FRVs) are those features, systems, processes, experiences, stories, scenes, sounds, smells, or other attributes determined to warrant primary consideration during planning and management processes because they are essential to achieving the purpose of the park and maintaining its significance. Fundamental resources and values are closely related to a park's legislative purpose and are more specific than significance statements. Fundamental resources and values help focus planning and management efforts on what is truly significant about the park. One of the most important responsibilities of NPS managers is to ensure the conservation and public enjoyment of those qualities that are essential (fundamental) to achieving the purpose of the park and maintaining its significance. If fundamental resources and values are allowed to deteriorate, the park purpose and/or significance could be jeopardized. The following fundamental resources and values have been identified for Valles Caldera National Preserve: \u00b7The Caldera. This volcanic system is one of the best-studied and scientifically renowned calderas in the world. Seminal work from the 1940s to the 1970s made Valles Caldera the first model of large caldera formation processes and now the global model of caldera resurgence. Valles Caldera was formed 1.25 million years ago by an eruption of approximately 75 cubic miles (300 km 3) of ash flows and high-viscosity molten rock. The ash-flow deposits from this and previous eruptions created the geologic layers used for prehistoric cliff dwellings in Bandelier National Monument and formed the hoodoos (tall skinny spires of rock) of Kasha-Katuwe T ent Rocks National Monument. The 12- to 15-mile-diameter caldera rim is almost intact, and the interior depression contains a circle of volcanic domes formed along a ring-fracture of the Earth's crust that surround the massive upwelling of Redondo, the resurgent mountain at the center. Valles Caldera is eligible for listing as a significant thermal feature in accordance with the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. \u00b7Valle Grande and Volcanic Vistas. The Valle Grande is the largest of several beautiful \"valles\" (V AH-yes) that are the namesake of the caldera. The stunning views of this broad grassland valley are the first experience for most visitors, many of whom are surprised by the unexpected lushness of this New Mexico high country . Pullouts along New Mexico State Route 4, which runs along the valley's southern edge, provide scenic vista points where visitors can gaze at the open grasslands, meandering streams and wetlands, and observe elk herds and other wildlife. Although many visitors assume that the Valle Grande is the caldera itself, it represents less than 20% of the actual caldera. From within each of the valles, a striking horizon is created where grassland meadows meet forested volcanic domes. This contrast serves as a visual reminder of the ancient lakes that once filled the basin and of the cold winter air that sinks into the valley bottoms, producing an inverted tree line that prevents new trees from growing. Along the north and south rims of the caldera, visitors can see rim to rim to grasp the magnitude of the caldera formation, as well as look outward across unobstructed mountaintop views of northern New Mexico and southern Colorado. Foundation Document8 \u00b7T raditional Cultural Landscapes and T ribal Connections. Valles Caldera, and the domes and peaks along its rim and within it, is of spiritual and ceremonial importance to numerous American Indian peoples in the greater Southwest region. Among these features, Redondo Peak (11,254 feet) is the highest point within the caldera and has served as a regionally significant geographic and cultural focal point and a pivotal sacred place for numerous tribal groups. These cultural connections are both contemporary and of great antiquity, and Valles Caldera continues to be part of the practices, beliefs, identity, and history of tribes and pueblos. This landscape is cherished by other communities as well and holds a special place in the heritage of regional peoples. \u00b7Prehistoric and Historic Legacy. The numerous archeological sites in the caldera provide evidence of thousands of years of human use of this landscape for hunting and gathering, seasonal habitation, and ceremonial pilgrimage. For millennia peoples were drawn to the caldera for its abundant high-quality volcanic glass called obsidian. It was used by prehistoric peoples as far away as eastern Nebraska, northern North Dakota, southern T exas, and western Mississippi. Historic structures and features on the landscape recall the caldera's use since before the 1800s for sheepherding and then cattle grazing, timber harvest, and other activities. In the early 1900s, development of the geothermal features at Sulphur Springs as a health resort demonstrates the past appreciation of the area as a destination for revitalization. \u00b7High Elevation Ecosystem. At the top of the Jemez Mountains, Valles Caldera contains the headwaters for the Jemez River, a tributary of the Rio Grande. The winter mountain snowpack and heavy summer monsoons provide the life flow that sustains abundant wildlife, downstream agriculture activities, and the growing urban centers of Albuquerque and Rio Rancho. The entire caldera is a hydrologic basin that provides groundwater recharge for a deep geothermal system and the warm springs, hot springs, fumaroles, acidic springs, gas vents, and mud pots on the mountain slopes. Rich vegetation diversity including valley wetlands, expansive grasslands, and forested mountain slopes creates a mosaic of wildlife habitats that is unique in the southwestern United States. These communities combine high-desert and mountain-dwelling wildlife communities that include numerous sensitive species and abundant game. 9 Valles Caldera National Preserve \u00b7A Landscape in Recovery. Addressing the legacy of human impacts on Valles Caldera is an essential purpose for which the preserve was established. The preserve provides an extraordinary setting and set of circumstances to educate the public about the ecological consequences of human-caused disturbances and the opportunities for achieving exemplary restoration to return a disturbed but beautiful landscape to a fully functioning ecosystem with enhanced landscape connectivity . Although this landscape appears \"pristine,\" intensive land uses while in private ownership throughout the mid-19th and 20th centuries, including livestock overgrazing, clear-cut logging, excessive roadbuilding, and geothermal exploration, have left a legacy of ecological alterations that persist today . In response, the National Park Service was charged by the U.S. Congress to continue innovative and effective landscape-scale ecological restoration efforts initiated by the Valles Caldera T rust to improve forest health, restore wetlands and riparian areas, and regain robust native fish and wildlife populations. The continuing success of these collaborative programs provides more than a management example; this dynamic recovery is an inherent value of this landscape and will place Valles Caldera at the forefront for studying responses to warming climates in changing ecosystems. Other Important Resources and Values Valles Caldera National Preserve contains other resources and values that are not fundamental to the purpose of the park and may be unrelated to its significance, but are important to consider in planning processes. These are referred to as \"other important resources and values\" (OIRV). These resources and values have been selected because they are important in the operation and management of the preserve and warrant special consideration in preserve planning. The following other important resources and values have been identified for Valles Caldera National Preserve: \u00b7Scientific Knowledge and Education. Valles Caldera serves as an important outdoor, landscape-scale laboratory and classroom for the study of natural processes and their intersection with prehistoric, historic, and contemporary human land use. The continuation of the preserve's robust science and education programs provides opportunities for direct experiential learning for visitors, citizen-science projects, enhanced science interpretation, and contributions to the state of human knowledge, understanding, and discovery . \u00b7History Grove. This 125-acre old-growth forest of 250-400-year-old Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir trees is among the few locations that make up the remaining five percent of magnificent forests not lost to 20th century logging. It stands in testimony both to the intact ecosystems before historic land-use practices and to the long-term potential of sustained forest restoration underway at the preserve. Easily accessible on the northern edge of the Valle Grande, this destination allows visitors to step into the past natural heritage of the Jemez Mountains and to experience the profoundly quiet soundscape of the caldera. Foundation Document10 Interpretive Themes Interpretive themes are often described as the key stories or concepts that visitors should understand after visiting a park\u2014they define the most important ideas or concepts communicated to visitors about a park unit. Themes are derived from, and should reflect, park purpose, significance, resources, and values. The set of interpretive themes is complete when it provides the structure necessary for park staff to develop opportunities for visitors to explore and relate to all park significance statements and fundamental and other important resources and values. Interpretive themes are an organizational tool that reveal and clarify meaning, concepts, contexts, and values represented by park resources. Sound themes are accurate and reflect current scholarship and science. They encourage exploration of the context in which events or natural processes occurred and the effects of those events and processes. Interpretive themes go beyond a mere description of the event or process to foster multiple opportunities to experience and consider the park and its resources. These themes help explain why a park story is relevant to people who may otherwise be unaware of connections they have to an event, time, or place associated with the park. The following interpretive themes have been identified for Valles Caldera National Preserve: \u00b7Valles Caldera's massive volcanic eruptions and caldera formation dramatically illustrate the awesome power of the Earth's explosive forces in reworking the globe's surface. \u00b7Valles Caldera's unusual setting\u2014high elevation, caldera topography, inverted tree line, and key hydrologic role at the top of the watershed\u2014presents a dynamic living laboratory in which to explore the complex relationships between humans and nature and the respective consequences and opportunities of ecosystem degradation and recovery . \u00b7The long and varied human history at Valles Caldera\u2014including peoples who maintain contemporary connections and traditions to this place\u2014inspires appreciation for the power of place-based cultural continuity and community . \u00b7Valles Caldera offers unparalleled opportunities to experience a landscape that inspires continual attraction, connections, and use independent of culture, heritage, and time. We are inspired to interact with the caldera in ways similar to the successful Archaic hunter-gatherers and their sustainable lifeways. \u00b7Valles Caldera's grassland valleys, lush forested volcanic domes, meandering streams, old growth Ponderosa pine groves, abundant wildlife, dark night skies, and backcountry solitude invite an innate, personal restoration and spiritual connection to the land. 11 Valles Caldera National PreservePart 2: Dynamic Components The dynamic components of a foundation document include special mandates and administrative commitments and an assessment of planning and data needs. These components are dynamic because they will change over time. New special mandates can be established and new administrative commitments made. As conditions and trends of fundamental and other important resources and values change over time, the analysis of planning and data needs will need to be revisited and revised, along with key issues. Therefore, this part of the foundation document will be updated accordingly . Special Mandates and Administrative Commitments Many management decisions for a park unit are directed or influenced by special mandates and administrative commitments with other federal agencies, state and local governments, utility companies, partnering organizations, and other entities. Special mandates are requirements specific to a park that must be fulfilled. Mandates can be expressed in enabling legislation, in separate legislation following the establishment of the park, or through a judicial process. They may expand on park purpose or introduce elements unrelated to the purpose of the park. Administrative commitments are, in general, agreements that have been reached through formal, documented processes, often through memorandums of agreement. Examples include easements, rights-of-way, arrangements for emergency response services, etc. Special mandates and administrative commitments can support, in many cases, a network of partnerships that help fulfill the objectives of the park and facilitate working relationships with other organizations. They are an essential component of managing and planning for Valles Caldera National Preserve. Special Mandates \u00b7The 2014 enabling legislation for Valles Caldera National Preserve provides direction concerning administration and general management, visitor access and other uses, ecological restoration, development of a science and education program, hunting and fishing opportunities, livestock grazing, tribal access to traditional cultural and religious sites, and protection of volcanic domes and other peaks in the preserve. These directives can be summarized as follows: -Establish a science and education program that includes research and interpretation, supports ecological restoration and science-based adaptive management, and promotes outdoor educational experiences; may establish a science and education center in Jemez Springs, New Mexico; -Continue livestock grazing to the extent that use furthers scientific research or interpretation of the ranching history of the preserve; -Permit hunting, fishing, and trapping in accordance with applicable federal and state laws; -Undertake restoration activities to improve the health of forest, grassland, and riparian areas; -Place certain limits on the construction of roads and buildings and motorized access on the tops of volcanic domes and other peaks; -Ensure the protection of traditional cultural and religious sites in the preserve and provide access to such sites by members of Indian tribes or pueblos for traditional cultural and customary uses; temporarily close to general public use specific areas of the preserve to protect traditional cultural and customary uses in the area by tribal members; maintain prohibitions on the use of motorized or mechanized travel on land located adjacent to the Santa Clara Indian Reservation; and -Study the feasibility of establishing a hiking trail along the rim of Valles Caldera on national park system and national forest system lands.Foundation Document12 \u00b7The 1975 national natural landmark designation recognizes the Valles Caldera as one of the largest calderas in the world and highlights it as an excellent example of a caldera advanced in history but still retaining the essential structures. Encompassing 99,219 acres, the Valles Caldera national natural landmark designation extends outside the preserve boundary to also include parts of Bandelier National Monument and Pueblo of Santa Clara lands. For more information about the existing administrative commitments for Valles Caldera National Preserve, please see appendix B. Assessment of Planning and Data Needs Once the core components of part 1 of the foundation document have been identified, it is important to gather and evaluate existing information about the park's fundamental and other important resources and values, and develop a full assessment of the park's planning and data needs. The assessment of planning and data needs section presents planning issues, the planning projects that will address these issues, and the associated information requirements for planning, such as resource inventories and data collection, including GIS data. There are three sections in the assessment of planning and data needs: 1. analysis of fundamental and other important resources and values 2. identification of key issues and associated planning and data needs 3. identification of planning and data needs (including spatial mapping activities or GIS maps) The analysis of fundamental and other important resources and values and identification of key issues leads up to and supports the identification of planning and data collection needs. Analysis of Fundamental Resources and Values The fundamental resource or value analysis table includes current conditions, potential threats and opportunities, planning and data needs, and selected laws and NPS policies related to management of the identified resource or value.Valles Caldera National Preserve13 Fundamental Resource or ValueThe Caldera Related Significance Statements Valles Caldera possesses exceptional value in illustrating and interpreting massive explosive volcanic eruptions, caldera formation, and the functioning of active geothermal systems . Valles Caldera is one of the world's best examples of an intact volcanic caldera and is considered the worldwide \"type locality\" habitats, key hydrologic role at the top of the watershed\u2014presents a dynamic learning landscape for the scientific study and restoration of ecosystem processes that are recovering from three centuries of human disturbances and challenged by contemporary and future climate change . Current Conditions and TrendsConditions The Valles Caldera formation and the geology of the preserve have been well studied by scientists and geologists . While the volcano is dormant, it is not extinct and will erupt again sometime in the future . The magma chamber associated with the caldera is located as shallow as 3 .1 miles (5 kilometers) depth below the surface of the preserve and provides heat for hot springs and other geothermal features . The geology of the caldera is in stable condition, but its geomorphology remains dynamic . Beginning in 1935 and continuing throughout private ownership, logging drastically changed the vegetation and appearance of the caldera . More than 1,000 miles of logging roads were developed and abandoned during this time and continue to terrace the caldera and volcanic domes . Except for the roads developed in connection to logging and ranching, there are no major roads or development in the caldera interior . This contributes to the integrity of the views but makes some portions of the preserve accessible only by non-motorized means . Geothermal wells developed while the land was privately owned are found throughout the western side of the caldera . A seismograph network operated by Los Alamos National Laboratory continuously monitors the magma chamber . LiDAR collected in 2010 yielded detailed topographic information and provides a baseline for measuring change; additional limited LiDAR was taken following the 2011 Las Conchas Fire . Sulphur Springs, one of most important geothermal features associated with the caldera, is a private inholding within the preserve; acquisition of these lands is being pursued . Multiple sensitive cultural features are located on the preserve's resurgent dome and volcanic peaks and along the caldera rim . Traditionally associated tribes consider these areas part of their sacred landscape . In 2003, a U .S . Geological Survey (USGS) team took high-resolution photos and GIS coordinates of the caldera's domes, and follow-up studies are planned to assess geomorphic deformation or movement of the dome . Felsenmeer-like rock fields, unusual geological features, are visible on volcanic domes and rims throughout the preserve . Trends Post-fire erosion continues to affect the preserve's geological and geomorphic features, as well as stream water quality, wildlife habitats, and vegetation within the caldera . There are no obvious indicators such as rapid dome growth, seismic activity, or recorded gas releases that would signal impending volcanic activity . Foundation Document14Fundamental Resource or ValueThe Caldera Threats and OpportunitiesThreats Geothermal wells currently not in use should be plugged and abandoned for hydrologic restoration and for public safety . Proposed geothermal development adjacent to the preserve in the Santa Fe National Forest could affect the plume associated with the caldera system . Seismic activity could affect preserve resources and threaten the safety of visitors and staff . Wildfires damage obsidian, contribute to soil loss and substantial post-fire erosion, and may result in long-term vegetation change . An incomplete seismic monitoring network and no gas/temperature monitoring leave the preserve vulnerable to unanticipated volcanic activity . Opportunities Conduct seismic monitoring to obtain real-time data for research, educational, and interpretive purposes . Acquire the Sulphur Springs inholding to allow for the comprehensive management of the caldera landscape and enhanced interpretation of the preserve's geothermal resources . Expand interpretation and educational programs to include information about current and ongoing scientific research and discoveries associated with the caldera's dynamic geology . Strengthen ongoing partnerships with geology field schools, universities, and research programs to foster scientific research and allow for increased monitoring and data collection of the preserve's geologic resources .

With caldera vistas from rim to rim, elk and other wildlife viewing, dark night skies, winter skiing, excellent hunting and fishing opportunities, and backcountry solitude, the landscape provides extraordinary year-round recreational opportunities and visitor experience . Current Conditions and TrendsConditions The term \"valles\" refers to the large grassland valleys created by the caldera's formation and subsequent lakes and inverted tree-line phenomenon . Valle Grande is the largest, best known, and most accessible of these valles . Valle Grande is grassy and has stable soils, mostly native vegetation, and little bare ground . Cattle grazing occurs on this landscape, and historic overgrazing of cattle and sheep has contributed to soil erosion, loss of riparian vegetation, and stream and wetland degradation . Current management including restoration and reduced stocking rates has reversed the degradation . Due to restoration efforts and decreased livestock numbers, wetlands and marshes in the preserve are recovering from almost 200 years of livestock impacts . Pre-settlement wetlands were probably fens, not the incised-channel streams seen today . Post-fire floods have started to reestablish fens in Valle Grande . Post-fire hillslope erosion has created alluvial fans . Invasive cheat grass and thistles are found in road corridors and burned areas and on alluvial fans . Past management practices have prevented fire activity in the valles and on domes, creating a break in the natural fire cycle . The preserve's expansive scenic views are mostly intact . The Valle Grande is mostly free of visible infrastructure or other developments . 20th century obstructions include maintained roads in the valles, logging roads on the domes, sheep and cattle ranching infrastructure (corrals, fences, stock tanks, earthen dams, large ground water well pumps, and movie sets) . Most visitors currently view the Valle Grande from New Mexico State Route 4 pullouts . Trail access to prime viewing locations outside the Valle Grande is fair to poor . Visitors are able to experience the \"archaic landscape\" relatively easily from existing roads and trails . Burned forests and post-fire erosion created by the Las Conchas Fire in 2011 and the Thompson Ridge Fire in 2013 are a noticeable aspect of the landscape . The Valle Grande entrance station constructed by the Valles Caldera Trust in 2009 and the corrals established by previous landowners are prominently located within the Valle Grande and are considered a visual obstruction . Radio repeaters are found on some of the preserve's domes and the caldera rim, but these are not visible intrusions to the scenery . Night skies are dark, with little light pollution from surrounding communities . Distant views are sometimes obscured by pollution-caused haze, and the visual range is reduced further on high pollution days, including during fires .Foundation Document16Fundamental Resource or ValueValle Grande and Volcanic Vistas Current Conditions and TrendsTrends The degraded condition of the valles due to 20th century grazing is improving . Fence removal has improved wildlife movements, opened the space for recreation, and improved the natural quality of the scenery . Wetlands connected to the valles are gradually recovering from heavy livestock use and post-fire floods . Decreased livestock numbers and active restoration projects are accelerating this trend . Meadow encroachment by trees and other forest vegetation is increasing around the edges of the valles . Visitation to the Valle Grande is increasing . Invasive species populations are increasing along road corridors, in previously burned areas, and in some areas of past heavy grazing . Post-fire erosion continues to change the landscape . Aspen and understory species are recovering in burned areas . Burned forests allow clearer views from the domes across the caldera . Threats and OpportunitiesThreats Invasive plants and nonnative animals can alter the appearance and ecology of the valles . Existing old, nonfunctional livestock fences threaten wildlife, interfere with recreational activities, and cause soil erosion along fence lines due to animal trampling . The lack of a periodic fire regime and prescribed burn schedule could lead to fuel buildup and a large-scale, uncontrolled fire event, as well as tree encroachment into valle grasslands . Tree encroachment can limit grassland species and impact the appearance of the valles . Adjacent geothermal development has the potential to introduce additional light and air pollution and increase noise . Increased numbers of cars and dust from vehicular traffic on the preserve's unimproved roads could impact the scenery . Sources of air pollution in the general area surrounding the preserve include coal-fired power plants, vehicle exhaust, oil and gas production, road dust, fires, and agriculture . At night, air pollution scatters artificial lights, increasing the effect of light pollution on the night sky . Projected effects of climate change could increase and exacerbate the impacts of extreme heat events, drought, wildfire, extreme storm events, and flooding, in the numbers of invasive species, and support a northward shift in native species habitats . The burned forest landscape, including dead or damaged trees and the resulting stumps, can be hazardous to visitor safety . Military overflights can disrupt the natural soundscape and introduce a visual intrusion .Valles Caldera National Preserve17Fundamental Resource or ValueValle Grande and Volcanic Vistas Threats and OpportunitiesOpportunities Continue to engage volunteers with invasive plant management and erosion control .

Past peoples across the continent were drawn to Valles Caldera to utilize its rich geologic deposits of high quality obsidian for tools and weapons, making this location one of the most significant cultural obsidian sources in North America . To this day, the caldera is used by local pueblo and tribal peoples and is cherished by more than two dozen American Indian groups . The land use history of Valles Caldera encapsulates the story of early Spanish and Mexican settlement across the present-day American Southwest and the socio-political shifts that occurred when the territory was annexed by the United States at the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848 . Previously known as Baca Location No . 1, Valles Caldera exemplifies the legacy of how the establishment, utilization, and changing ownership of Spanish and Mexican land grants transformed the Southwest . Current Conditions and TrendsConditions Many surrounding tribes and tribal members continue to come to the preserve for traditional practices and to maintain connection with the place . Redondo Peak, along with other domes and peaks in the caldera, is considered sacred by many surrounding tribes . High-quality data about many of the preserve's cultural resources and landscapes were collected during Valles Caldera Trust management . Historic cabins in the preserve are generally well documented but need maintenance and restoration to ensure their long-term well-being . Some historic buildings were previously removed from the historic ranching district . Roads constructed during private ownership spiral up many of the caldera's domes and peaks and need significant restoration and re-contouring . Natural free-flowing springs and other water sources are in relatively good condition . Trends Cultural resources, both the built environment and larger landscapes, are degrading at a rapid rate due to recent fires, flooding, and extreme weather and seasonal temperature shifts . The 2013 Thompson Ridge Fire burned in a mosaic pattern with varying levels of severity on Redondo Peak . The increase in general visitation has also led to increased desire to know more about traditional cultural uses and historic sites . Improved infrastructure (including roads, trails, and facilities) is needed to address increased visitation by the public and researchers and administrative uses . Historic structures and archeological resources continue to deteriorate . Cultural resources inventory and documentation continues throughout the preserve . The 2013 Thompson Ridge Fire resulted in a loss of aspen carvings and other historic wood resources on Redondo Mountain; dead trees will continue to fall for several years, but aspen and understory vegetation are regenerating abundantly .Foundation Document20Fundamental Resource or ValueTraditional Cultural Landscapes and Tribal Connections Threats and OpportunitiesThreats Climate change could affect vegetation associated with traditional uses and practice . Historic building materials could be damaged by severe weather events, associated erosion, and rodents . Severe fire and post-fire erosion could affect cultural landscapes through changes in character-defining features including biota, cultural features, geomorphology, and hydrology . The 2013 Thompson Ridge Fire and overall forest health could alter the \"eagle\" outline that some tribes reference as an important part of Redondo Peak's appearance and cultural significance . Climate change and insect outbreaks could impact native flowers and plants in the preserve . Military overflights can disrupt the natural soundscape and introduce a visual intrusion, particularly during traditional and ceremonial activities by tribes and pueblos . Opportunities Continue to work with local tribes and pueblos to develop a map with traditional place and feature names for interpretation and signage . Increase partnership with traditionally associated tribes to plan and assist with special events, school groups, educational materials, and interpretive programing . Look at opportunities for adaptive reuse of historic structures to meet contemporary management needs .

Previously known as Baca Location No . 1, Valles Caldera exemplifies the legacy of how the establishment, utilization, and changing ownership of Spanish and Mexican land grants transformed the Southwest . Current Conditions and TrendsConditions Archeological sites, historic resources, and other cultural resources from time periods from 10,000 years ago to the recent historic era are ubiquitous throughout the preserve . Archeological surveys are underway but have covered less than 35% of the preserve . Just under 800 archeological sites have been documented, probably less than 50% of the total present . Archeological sites from the pre-agricultural Archaic period are especially abundant and well represented in deep subsurface cultural deposits . Obsidian is a geological resource connected to the formation of the volcanic caldera, as well as a cultural resource and the main raw material used to make the artifacts found at the abundant archeological sites throughout the caldera . There is good baseline knowledge related to the geology of the preserve's obsidian . Prehistoric obsidian quarries and other cultural resources located on the preserve are poorly documented . Cultural landscapes lack adequate documentation . The 2011 Las Conchas Fire severely impacted obsidian deposits in the preserve through both severe fire damage and post-fire erosion . Historic buildings in the Cabin District provide an excellent opportunity to interpret the 19th and 20th century history of the American Southwest . Cabins dating from as early as 1915 need substantial preservation work to maintain their longevity in the harsh winter climate . The lowest elevation landform in the preserve was the highest elevation extent of pueblo agriculture . Trends Given the ubiquitous presence of obsidian fragments and artifacts in the preserve, the collection of surface deposits by visitors is an ongoing issue that could increase as visitation increases . Erosion throughout the preserve, especially as the result of forest fires, has increased exposure of in situ geologic obsidian, artifact damage and exposure, and loss of buried deposits at archeological sites . Historic cabins continue to experience detrimental effects from harsh winter conditions and lack of adequate maintenance . Annual rates of archeological surveys are increasing in order to inventory areas in advance of large landscape restoration projects . The 2013 Thompson Ridge Fire and the 2011 Las Conchas Fire resulted in a loss of aspen carvings and other historic wood resources .Valles Caldera National Preserve23Fundamental Resource or ValuePrehistoric and Historic Legacy Threats and OpportunitiesThreats Given the presence of obsidian fragments and other cultural artifacts in the preserve, the collection of surface deposits is of concern . Fire damages geologic obsidian as well as obsidian artifacts, and post-fire erosion causes substantial loss of cultural deposits . Historic resources with wood, such as aspen carvings, corrals, cabins and ephemeral wood features (e .g ., hunting blinds, expedient shelters, spring developments) are vulnerable to combustion in wildfires . Wildfire and the subsequent erosion can uncover archeological sites and wash away obsidian and other cultural resources . Erosion following the 2013 Thompson Ridge Fire has created risks for historic buildings in the Cabin District . Lack of adequate maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and preservation work on historic cabins and other structures could accelerate their continued deterioration . Removal of ranching infrastructure and the addition of new elements to historic settings could alter the historic character and interpretive potential of the preserve . Opportunities Evaluate historic cabins for interpretive use . Take advantage of public interest in volunteer projects supporting historic cabins that has increased with increased visitation .

Valles Caldera's distinct topographic mosaic of expansive valley meadows, lush forested volcanic domes, meandering valley streams, and old growth Ponderosa pine groves are in striking contrast to the arid New Mexico landscapes at lower elevations . With caldera vistas from rim to rim, elk and other wildlife viewing, dark night skies, winter skiing, excellent hunting and fishing opportunities, and backcountry solitude, the landscape provides extraordinary year-round recreational opportunities and visitor experience . Current Conditions and TrendsConditions High levels of plant and invertebrate biodiversity provide important habitat and food webs for a wide variety of wildlife species . The preserve supports a diversity of vertebrate wildlife species: 59 mammals, 103 breeding birds, 6 reptiles, 3 amphibians, and 7 fish . When combined with neighboring lands the preserve provides large areas of contiguous habitat allowing for elevational migration throughout the year . The preserve is identified as part of the Jemez Mountains Conservation Opportunity Area by the State of New Mexico . The preserve provides habitat for a variety of migratory birds of conservation concern by the U .S . Fish and Wildlife Service . Federal and state listed threatened and endangered species, as well as multiple species found nowhere else in the state, are present in the preserve . The preserve is included in the suitable habitat for the endangered New Mexico meadow jumping mouse and the threatened Mexican spotted owl, but there have been no reported sightings . Hunting of elk and turkey occurs in the preserve . Hunting on the surrounding national forest influences populations of all game animals in the caldera . Although New Mexico has no native earthworms, three species of European earthworms have established on the preserve . Significant changes in grassland and forest ecosystem functioning (litter processing and soil nutrient cycling) could occur . Prairie dog colonies are present throughout the preserve . Brown and rainbow trout are nonnative species that have become popular among visitors for fishing opportunities . Crayfish are also nonnative . The current Rocky Mountain elk population of approximately 2,000 animals in the caldera (4,000-6,000 across the Jemez Mountains) is very high compared with historic levels and is the result of 20th century reintroductions from both Wyoming and Colorado . Coyotes, bears, mountain lions, and bobcats are found throughout the preserve . Studies have been conducted to better understand their dietary habits and predation of elk . The 2011 Las Conchas and 2013 Thompson Ridge fires severely altered most wildlife habitats including a majority of critical habitat for the endangered Jemez Mountains salamander . There are ongoing studies using radio collars for elk, mule deer, black bear, and mountain lions . Migratory birds, including bald eagles and golden eagles, use the preserve . Chitrid fungus is present on amphibians found in the preserve . The caldera is an important headwaters area at the top of the watershed hydrology system and is considered the \"spring\" of the Jemez Mountains . The preserve includes springs, bogs, and streams, all of which are considered high-value natural and cultural resources . Streams, wetlands, ephemeral pools and associated riparian vegetation provide important habitat for several \"at risk\" wildlife species . Foundation Document26Fundamental Resource or ValueHigh Elevation Ecosystem Current Conditions and TrendsConditions (continued) Numerous riparian planting enclosures have been constructed that have the potential to create habitat for sensitive species . Streams in the preserve have been assessed since 2001 . The major streams are listed as having impaired water quality based on 303(d) Clean Water Act determination factors, namely temperature and turbidity . All perennial streams throughout the preserve are monitored regularly for water quality and quantity . The headwaters in the preserve contribute to downstream water users including tribes, agriculturalists, and municipal areas . Past grazing and logging activity impacted preserve water quality and quantity, the effects of which continue . Streams continue to suffer impacts from trespass cattle entering the preserve . Numerous stock tanks and earthen dams constructed in the 1960s are in various states of repair . Post-fire erosion has impacted water quality and quantity, and riparian, wetland and aquatic systems . Poorly designed and maintained roads are contributing sediment to streams . Many stream reaches are incised and no longer connected to their floodplains . Historically, these streams were probably broad fens rather than single incised channels . The preserve's surface water system was destroyed by post fire runoff . An old well\u2014 constructed while under private ownership\u2014has been pressed into service for domestic water supply in the Cabin District . Trends Overall, streams show an improvement in most reaches of their proper functioning condition . Some preliminary analysis by the state environmental department indicates a possible trend of temperature decrease on a stretch of the Rio San Antonio . Willow, cottonwood, and aspen plantings throughout the preserve are showing survival and growth in several areas . Ongoing forest and wetland restoration projects (thinning, burning, wetland creation) continue to influence and change wildlife presence and habitats throughout the preserve and surrounding Santa Fe National Forest and contribute to increased water yields for downstream users . Post-fire erosion, partially related to poorly engineered and maintained preserved roads, negatively impacts local water quality . The elk population across the entire Jemez Mountains has grown from 100 in 1970 to as many as 6,000 today . This incr ease is linked to low predation with loss of key predators, and increased montane meadow habitat due to past logging activities and wildfires . Elk calving dropped to ~15 calves per 100 cows in 2009 and has now grown to ~32 calves per 100 cows . The preserve continues to discover species that were previously unknown to the area, such as the striped and hog-nosed skunks, and the yellow-bellied marmot . Areas of high-severity burning during the 2011 Las Conchas and 2013 Thompson Ridge fires are becoming grasslands, affecting grazing and browsing acreage, causing shifts from forest-dwelling to meadow-dwelling species, and causing a reduction in species richness . Migratory eagle numbers are down compared to estimates from the early 2000s . The frequency of activity by young male mountain lions has increased while older male adults have decreased . Hunting in the preserve will affect population numbers and age/sex demographics for hunted species . Reintroduced native species of long-nosed dace, Rio Grande chub, Rio Grande sucker, and northern leopard frogs are all showing signs of long-term survival . Climate change is stressing wildlife and vegetation species found at upper elevations including pika, spruce trees, and understory species .Valles Caldera National Preserve27Fundamental Resource or ValueHigh Elevation Ecosystem Threats and OpportunitiesThreats Increased temperatures and changing precipitation regimes associated with climate change will impact hydrology and increase drought stress for trees throughout the preserve . Fire and post-fire erosion can change the flow of streams within the watershed . In-use preserve roads are impacted by erosion . Flooding events can cut off access to main roads, creating public safety concerns and significant maintenance needs . Sedimentation from inadequate road drainage negatively affects water quality and can impact drainage paths . Artesian wells in Valle Toledo and Valle Grande tap into deep groundwater resources . A significant leak exists in the Valle Toledo wellhead, which may adversely affect the underground aquifer . Ther e also are visible leaks at the surface in the Valle Grande wellhead . Invasive plant species can affect plant communities and wildlife food sources . Wildfires have the potential to drastically change habitats and vegetation . Post-fire and road-related erosion creates new drainage paths and can remove grassland vegetation and create opportunities for noxious weed invasion . Trespass livestock grazing damages vegetation in riparian zones and contributes to soil and watershed impacts . Prairie dogs are vulnerable to plague and have the potential to spread disease throughout colonies and to visitors and/or their pets . There have been confirmed cases in prairie dogs within preserve colonies in 2004 and 2016 . Poaching negatively affects species populations . Old livestock fences can entangle and injure large mammal wildlife . Climate change can alter species habitat and lead to species extinction . The large elk population impacts restoration efforts and aspen regeneration . Chitrid fungus and Rana virus have been detected in the preserve and have the potential to harm amphibian populations . Nonnative earthworms are likely changing soil structure and functioning . The potential for human-wildlife interactions could change as human activity in the preserve by visitors and researchers and from other administrative uses increases . Natural communities are at risk from the potential effects of air pollution; for example, ozone-sensitive plants, mercury contamination in wildlife, and nutrient enrichment and acidification effects . Climate change could negatively affect species such as pika, and the potential effects on other species need further study . White-nose syndrome could be a threat to bat species on the preserve . Increased visitation, staff uses, and research activities could impact wildlife behavior, spread disease, and increase noxious weeds . Opportunities Partner with tribes, adjacent landowners, and downstream water users to monitor water quality and increase the protection and conservation of native species . Maintain and establish new partnerships with the preserve's friends group and other nonprofit groups to support ecological restoration and inventory and monitoring efforts in support the preserve's mission . Reintroduce native species, including species listed as endangered or threatened, to promote the preserve's mandate to restore natural ecosystem processes . Continue watershed restoration projects to improve riparian vegetation, which could provide future habitat for federally threatened and endangered species as well as several important state listed species .

Valles Caldera National Preserve was first established in 2000 as an unprecedented national experiment in public land management, through which the U .S . Congress sought to evaluate the efficiency, economy, and effectiveness of decentralized public land management . The 15-year experiment continues to contribute to the national dialogue on the role of protected areas for long-term economic and environmental sustainability, and innovative approaches to place-based and science-based adaptive management . Current Conditions and TrendsConditions 19th and 20th century overgrazing of livestock in the valles is apparent in historic aerial photographs dating back to 1935 . These aerial photographs document eroded hillslopes, sedimentation fans along the base of slopes, and extensive gullies . Pairing of historic and contemporary photography has demonstrated historic impacts on vegetation from grazing, logging, and roadbuilding, including meadow encroachment and loss of riparian plants such as willows . Clear-cut logging from 1963 to 1971 left more than 1,000 miles of logging roads, most of which were never reclaimed . The topographic scars of these roads are documented clearly in contemporary LiDAR mapping . Today, some vegetation has returned within road beds, but this recovery is limited . Geothermal energy exploration, begun tentatively in the 1950s and pursued actively in the 1970s and 1980s, left numerous earthen modifications, some of which are massive in Redondo Canyon and Sulphur Canyon . Geothermal well pads were carved into the mountainsides, and exploration activities damaged sites that contain unique geothermal resources . Wetlands and streams were heavily degraded by the overgrazing of riparian grasslands and sedimentation runoff from logging clear-cuts . Suppression of fires throughout the 20th century has been documented through fire scar sampling and dendrochronology . Dense second gr owth forests that developed without natural fire-return intervals produced forests at increased risk for uncharacteristic wildfire and wildfires with high burn severity . Invasive weed species in the preserve are especially abundant in recent burn scars and along roadways . Vegetation in the valles and forested slopes has been burned during past wildfires . The most recent major fire activity includes the 2011 Las Conchas and the 2013 Thompson Ridge fires, which together burned 60% of the preserve . Numerous diverse restoration projects to reduce uncharacteristic forest densities, enhance riparian function, and decrease impacts of noxious invasive species are underway as part of the Department of the Interior's Resilient Landscape Initiative and the Department of Agriculture's Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration program . Trends Road conditions continue to deteriorate with use, weather, and erosion . Aerial photography from 1935 to present demonstrates consistent recovery from the impacts of pre-2000 livestock overgrazing, including decreased surface erosion, revegetation of slopes, healing gullies, and decreased sedimentation at bases of slopes . The preserve has developed a diverse set of datasets, tools, and monitoring programs to assess existing conditions and to measure trends in ecosystem responses to restoration activities .Valles Caldera National Preserve31Fundamental Resource or ValueA Landscape in Recovery Current Conditions and TrendsTrends (continued) Forest and watershed restoration projects implemented during the past decade, and continuing into the present are improving the overall ecological health of the preserve and allowing for the safe and effective management of fire across the landscape . Inventory and monitoring efforts associated with restoration projects are confirming improvements to wildlife habitat, water quality and quantity, and improved biodiversity . Threats and OpportunitiesThreats Lack of proper fencing has resulted in livestock grazing in sensitive areas, including in riparian areas and on volcanic domes burned in recent fires . Continued grazing in sensitive areas could negatively affect post-fire recovery and watershed restoration . The presence and distribution of noxious weed species is increasing in response to wildfire damage, and use and maintenance of roadways . Climate change could result in changing ground water hydrology including water quality, temperature, and quantity . Drought stress in trees resulting from climate warming has been well documented in the Jemez Mountains . Resulting risks include increased potential of uncharacteristic wildfire, tree mortality, and a proliferation of pests such as bark beetles . Ongoing forest and wetland restoration will largely be beneficial but could pose a threat to some species and habitats . Increased visitation, staff uses, and research activities may put pressure on recovering resources . Opportunities Educate the public about the long-term effects of historic land management practices and the benefits of ecological restoration to mitigate those impacts, including returning wildfire into a fire-adapted ecosystem . Consider reintroduction of the New Mexico meadow jumping mouse and other threatened and endangered species to promote overall ecosystem functioning and biodiversity . Increase volunteer participation and partnerships in preserve restoration activities to promote public understanding and support for similar efforts elsewhere while further improving the health of the preserve's ecosystems . Develop curriculum-based interpretation programs and activities to engage with school groups and other youth groups to further the preserve's congressional mandate to promote science and education .

Valles Caldera possesses exceptional value in illustrating and interpreting massive explosive volcanic eruptions, caldera formation, and the functioning of active geothermal systems . Valles Caldera is one of the world's best examples of an intact volcanic caldera and is considered the worldwide \"type locality\" for caldera resurgence . Current Conditions and TrendsConditions There is considerable published academic information related to caldera geology . Recent syntheses include a new geology map and a geologic history book designed for the public . Results and information obtained from research and monitoring at the preserve have contributed to natural and cultural resource management at the local, state, federal, and international levels . Valles Caldera has played an internationally significant role in studies of volcanology, the theory of continental drift and plate tectonics, and the development of obsidian hydration dating . The preserve is home to a unique record of the Holocene period, which is of great interest to archeologists, environmental scientists, and historical ecologists . The Jemez Mountains is a key area for the development of place-based science research, especially historical ecology and fire studies . Extensive collaboration with external scientists has resulted in a wide variety of research projects conducted in the preserve and many peer-reviewed publications . Extensive biological inventory and monitoring data were collected by the Valles Caldera Trust, and these inventory and monitoring programs continue today . Species inventories are virtually complete for plants, fungi, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, fungi, lichens, and a number of groups of insects, spiders and other invertebrates . Soil biota and many invertebrate groups still need to be inventoried . Ecosystem restoration activities are rigorously monitored to ensure that science-based adaptive management is incorporated into planning and implementation decisions . Archeological surveys are underway but have covered less than 35% of the preserve . Although considerable data have been collected on natural and cultural resources, these data files need to be reformatted and integrated into the NPS data management system . Data are being published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, but public interpretation of these results needs expansion and improvement . External and internal data, reports, and articles have not been organized for reference . Synthesizing this information is necessary to improve its usefulness and availability to interested parties and outside researchers and to create meaningful interpretive products for the public . Improved documentation and mapping of invasive species distribution and abundance within the preserve is needed . Curriculum-based primary and secondary education programming is integrated into the preserve's collection of scientific data, and demand for this programming already exceeds the preserve's existing capacity . The preserve holds an extensive collection of scientific photos, which needs improved organization, tagging, and digital storage space .Foundation Document34Other Important Resource or ValueScientific Knowledge and Education Current Conditions and TrendsTrends With the completion of many of the resource inventories begun by the Valles Caldera Trust, scientific emphasis is shifting to monitoring programs associated with restoration activities and to collaboration with outside scientists who elect to use the preserve for their own funded grant projects . The landscape restoration program has been the major source of support for scientific activities on the preserve . There has been a loss of some stream water monitoring stations due to post-fire flash floods that will need replacement . Recent fire activity has increased interest in fire regime studies . Threats and OpportunitiesThreats Lack of organization of data could result in a loss of information or delayed synthesis and interpretation . Information is lost when outside researchers sometimes do not share data sets or completed reports of research completed in the preserve . The lack of standardized electronic metadata decreases the preserve's ability to interpret and curate scientific information and imagery . Monitoring data are generally not in stable, long-term databases . Absent thoughtful succession planning and data management there is potential for loss of institutional knowledge and sufficient transfer of information . Lack of staff to share scientific research through education programs will decrease information reach . Opportunities Continue establishment and maintenance of long-term study sites and instrument infrastructure to enhance participation by outside (non-NPS) scientists and researchers . Meet requirements of the enabling legislation that specify the importance of science and education research and interpretation and their role in outdoor educational experiences . Develop the preserve as a model for citizen-science and environmental education .

Valles Caldera's elevation, caldera topography, unfragmented habitats, key hydrologic role at the top of the watershed\u2014presents a dynamic learning landscape for the scientific study and restoration of ecosystem processes that are recovering from three centuries of human disturbances and challenged by contemporary and future climate change . Current Conditions and TrendsConditions Overall, the trees that make up History Grove are in good condition . The Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir trees are fire adapted and have survived historic fire events . Recent evidence, however, indicates some deterioration in tree health . There has been a recorded loss of upslope trees outside the grove following the 2013 Thompson Ridge Fire due to direct fire damage and subsequent beetle damage, erosion, and deposition . Drought stress and increasing infestation of pest insects after the 2013 Thompson Ridge Fire are negatively impacting tree health . Beetles have caused rapid mortality to many old- growth Douglas fir trees in the grove . Approximately 35% of the History Grove trees have been mapped . The grove is near the main preserve entrance and easily accessed by visitors . Culturally marked trees in the grove are in good condition . There have been no controlled or managed burns in the History Grove since 2000 . Following the Thompson Ridge Fire, Jemez Mountains Electric Coop cut 38 old-growth trees from the preserve without the preserve's permission . A large percentage of the grove's ground cover consists of nonnative or naturalized grasses, but the distribution of species has not been systematically mapped . These grasses could affect future managed burns . The age of the trees (>300 years) provides an archive of past precipitation, drought, fire conditions, and climate . There are limited designated parking areas for visitors; access for groups is especially difficult . Trends Invasive plant species, including cheat grass and thistles, are present in the grove and are possibly increasing in frequency . There is a significant decline in old-growth trees due to direct and indirect fire effects and beetles . The number of falling trees has increased in the last few years . Public visitation to the grove is expected to continue to grow .Valles Caldera National Preserve37Other Important Resource or ValueHistory Grove Threats and OpportunitiesThreats Uncontrolled wildfires could kill old-growth trees throughout the preserve . Invasive plants, insect pest species, and drought stress could compromise the grove's health . A sudden die-off of more than a dozen old-growth Douglas fir trees occurred in 2017 due to beetle infestation . Encroachment of other plants could change the vegetation associated with the grove . Increased vehicular traffic could disturb the natural soundscape associated with the site and increase dust and air pollution . Trash, trampled grasses, and vehicular damage along the road corridor could affect the old-growth trees . Increased visitation contributes to compacted soil restricting natural hydration . The effects of climate change on old-growth trees are unknown . Trees reaching the end of their lifespan have the potential to become safety hazards that could affect staff or visitor safety and also threaten the few structures in/near the grove . Routing of vehicular traffic through the grove impacts air quality, soundscape, and solitude . Opportunities The History Grove is for many the first, and sometimes the only, place to experience an old-growth forest . Promote the grove as a place for visitors to experience natural soundscapes and solitude .

A key issue focuses on a question that is important for a park. Key issues often raise questions regarding park purpose and significance and fundamental and other important resources and values. For example, a key issue may pertain to the potential for a fundamental or other important resource or value in a park to be detrimentally affected by discretionary management decisions. A key issue may also address crucial questions that are not directly related to purpose and significance, but which still affect them indirectly . Usually, a key issue is one that a future planning effort or data collection needs to address and requires a decision by NPS managers. The following are key issues for Valles Caldera National Preserve and the associated planning and data needs to address them: \u00b7Operational Capacity and Infrastructure. Due to the lack of suitable facilities in the preserve, administrative and operational activities are managed at a facility under short-term lease in the Village of Jemez Springs, New Mexico, approximately 20 miles from the preserve's main entrance. This creates financial and logistical issues for preserve managers and safety issues for preserve staff who must spend extensive travel time on New Mexico State Route 4 (a two-lane mountainous road) between the preserve and its headquarters. Existing facilities in the preserve include historic structures dating back to the early 20th century and more contemporary nonhistoric facilities. Currently, facilities within this maintained frontcountry landscape require significant maintenance, including necessary utility upgrades (water, power, sewer, telecommunications, heating, etc.). With the termination of the Jemez Springs headquarters lease in September 2019, existing facilities within the preserve should be evaluated for adaptive reuse as administrative headquarters. -Associated planning and data needs: Development concept plan; historic structure use/adaptive reuse plan; sustainability plan; historic building assessments/historic structure report; assessment of long-term needs of individual historic structures \u00b7T ransportation and Preserve Infrastructure. Valles Caldera National Preserve contains more than 1,000 miles of unimproved old ranch and logging roads, a limited number of which are authorized for public and/or administrative motorized vehicle use. Of immediate and pressing concern is rehabilitating the main entrance road and contact stations in the Valle Grande. All other public/administrative routes also require significant maintenance, especially those impacted by erosion damage following the 2011 Las Conchas and 2013 Thompson Ridge wildfires. T ransportation and circulation planning are needed to identify suitable routes for use by the public, administration, and emergency response. T ransportation planning would be undertaken in the context of broader preserve-wide planning, and needs to be integrated closely with 1) trail/trailhead development, 2) designated parking, 3) road decommissioning of unused logging roads, and 4) resource protection and wilderness inventory and management. -Associated planning and data needs: control general management plan; sign management plan; trails management plan; wilderness inventory; mapping of post-fire erosion and modeling of erosion risks; mapping of debris flow and encroachment into valles Foundation Document40 \u00b7Visitor Use and Support Infrastructure. Valles Caldera National Preserve is poised to make a broad spectrum of decisions that address balancing increasing visitor use and maintaining the natural values of the preserve. Key strategic decisions are needed to establish the short- and long-term priorities for managing public visitation and enhancing visitor experience. Existing infrastructure to support and sustain visitation is extremely limited, lacking even basic components such as parking areas and comfort stations. Within the preserve's frontcountry, site-specific development concept plans are needed to establish focal points for visitor experience. Facilities are needed for education programming along with a diverse set of tangible products for the visitor interface, including signage and interpretive displays and waysides. In the preserve's frontcountry and backcountry, design and development of a comprehensive trail network is needed to achieve high-quality visitor experiences. This includes the establishment of a caldera rim trail, as called for in the preserve's enabling legislation. -Associated planning and data needs: Development concept plan; trails management plan; transportation transition plan; site planning for adaptation to climate change; commercial services strategy; historic structure use/adaptive reuse plan; community and regional trails plan (in collaboration with the NPS Rivers, T rails, and Conservation Assistance Program); visitor use information; wilderness inventory; cultural landscapes inventory; GIS analysis for trails, roads, and parking needs \u00b7Climate Change. Long-term climate data for the State of New Mexico suggest that the Jemez Mountains are warming at a faster rate than other regions of the state. Valles Caldera and the broader Jemez Mountains form an isolated sky island (rather than a mountain chain) that reduces migration options for many sensitive plant and wildlife species. Climate change vulnerability at Valles Caldera in recent decades has already been expressed through warmer temperatures and drought and an associated increase in risk for catastrophic wildfires such as the 2011 Las Conchas and 2013 Thompson Ridge wildfires, which combined burned approximately two-thirds of the preserve. The 2011 Las Conchas Fire was particularly damaging, with large areas of high burn severity, high tree mortality, and profound post-fire erosion. Assessment and adaptation planning is needed to understand the range of potential effects of climate change on uncharacteristic wildfire activity, ecosystem processes, hydrology, archeological resources, and biodiversity in this temperature-sensitive high-elevation environment. -Associated planning and data needs: Planning for adaptation to climate change; integrated pest management plan; resource stewardship strategy; climate/weather monitoring; analysis of drought stress across diverse ecosystem components; study of temporal trends in forest/meadow ecosystems41 Valles Caldera National Preserve \u00b7Sulphur Springs Inholding. Situated within a 40-acre block near the western boundary, Sulphur Springs is the only privately owned inholding within the preserve. The area has significant natural and cultural resources that can contribute to the education and interpretation of the preserve's geologic, scientific, and historical values. The bubbling acid-sulfate springs, mud pots, and fumaroles at Sulphur Springs are very rare in the western United States and unique in New Mexico. In 1901 the Otero family developed the site as a health resort, with its own stagecoach line to bring tourists to the bathhouses and hotel. Almost all traces of this historic commercial development are now gone, but the landscape still shows the modifications of a brief Otero venture in surface mining at about the same time. In 2016 the property was sold to a private owner who is interested in selling the property to the National Park Service. -Associated planning and data needs: Land protection plan; geologic resources management plan; assessment of geologic hazards and mitigation measures; continued monitoring of streams and water quality; historic resource study; cultural landscapes inventory; inventory and protocols for monitoring geologic features; mapping of post-fire erosion and modeling of erosion risks \u00b7Management of Valles Caldera T rust Administrative, Data, and Collections Legacy. From 2002 to 2015, prior to its designation as a unit of the national park system, Valles Caldera was managed as a national preserve by the Valles Caldera T rust. An administrative history is needed to document these years under the predecessor agency, to capture and communicate the significance of this experiment in federal land management, and to provide context for the lessons learned under Valles Caldera T rust management. Evaluation is needed of prior National Environmental Policy Act analyses, management plans, activities, and other products to determine the utility of all or parts of these efforts for current preserve needs. This effort is of timely importance to preempt the loss of institutional memory and to rapidly determine the disposition of Valles Caldera T rust administrative archives. Equally important is the need to assess the retention and organization of a large disparate body of natural and cultural resources data and to develop a plan for curation of physical collections including archeological and historic items, and natural history specimens. -Associated planning and data needs: Collection management plan; data management plan; scope of collections statement; administrative history Foundation Document42 \u00b7Fire Risk and Recovery. Although significant investments have been made in fire planning, wildfire recovery, and proactive landscape scale restoration and risk reduction, further analysis and planning are needed to address this major threat. The preserve experienced two major wildfires. T ogether, the 2011 Las Conchas and 2013 Thompson Ridge fires burned two-thirds of the preserve, and landscape damage from these fires has been profound. Major impacts on slope stability, soil health, and water quality have resulted from post-fire erosion, which also continues to impact roads infrastructure and the water system in the preserve's Cabin District. Invasive plant and insect species have increased, and large areas of standing dead trees threaten visitor safety and interfere with administrative activities. Large uncharacteristic wildfire continues to be a significant risk in the Jemez Mountains, further elevated by extended drought and climate warming, unhealthy forest conditions resulting from past logging, overgrazing, and fire suppression practices and the wildland-urban interface surrounding the preserve. -Associated planning and data needs: Fire management plan; planning for adaptation to climate change; integrated pest management plan; structural fire plan for the Cabin District; spatial fire risk assessment; mapping of post-fire erosion and modeling of erosion risks; update LiDAR coverage to measure current post-fire erosion and monitor stream channel changes; historic photo analysis; quality control/assurance and analysis of GIS data Planning and Data Needs T o maintain connection to the core elements of the foundation and the importance of these core foundation elements, the planning and data needs listed here are directly related to protecting fundamental resources and values, park significance, and park purpose, as well as addressing key issues. T o successfully undertake a planning effort, information from sources such as inventories, studies, research activities, and analyses may be required to provide adequate knowledge of park resources and visitor information. Such information sources have been identified as data needs. Geospatial mapping tasks and products are included in data needs. Items considered of the utmost importance were identified as high priority, and other items identified, but not rising to the level of high priority, were listed as either medium- or low-priority needs. These priorities inform park management efforts to secure funding and support for planning projects.Valles Caldera National Preserve43Planning Needs - Where A Decision-Making Process Is Needed Related to an FRV, OIRV, or Key Issue?Planning NeedsPriority (H, M, L)Notes FRV, Key Issue General management planH The enabling legislation requires that a general management plan be completed within three years from date of funding being made available .

In addition, it would address specific questions regarding predator and ungulate management, reintroduction of native species, and protection and recovery of endangered and threatened species and their habitats . A wildlife management plan would serve to engage the public and consult with associated Indian tribes and pueblos when considering how to manage wildlife species in the preserve . Valles Caldera National Preserve45 Planning Needs - Where A Decision-Making Process Is Needed Related to an FRV, OIRV, or Key Issue?Planning NeedsPriority (H, M, L)Notes FRV, OIRV, Key Issue Fire management plan H The preserve contains fire-adapted ecosystems with extensive fire history . A component of the pr eserve's ecological restoration goals is to reintegrate wildland fire into the ecosystem in a manner that reduces the potential for uncharacteristically high severity wildfire while enhancing wildlife habitat and watershed function . A fire management plan, coupled with the Landscape Restoration Stewardship Plan completed by the Valles Caldera Trust, would provide a roadmap for preserve managers to implement this strategy while engaging with the public and associated tribal governments . OIRV, Key IssueArchives management planH As a new NPS unit with 15 years of preceding agency management, the preserve has a large quantity of paper and digital documents that need to be organized and stored to meet NPS standards; to fulfill obligations for ongoing litigation; and to achieve disposition with the National Archives . Ar chives management should be designed to coordinate with file management planning for active in-use electronic files . FRV Cultural resources management planM To facilitate planning, preservation, and interpretation goals, an overarching cultural resources management plan is needed that summarizes the cultural resources in the preserve, their condition and level of documentation, and the threats to the resources . The plan would guide research, planning, and stewardship of archeological sites, historic resources, and cultural landscapes; potential traditional cultural properties, sacred sites, and traditional resources . The plan would also include site significance standards . A systematic approach needs to be tailored to the diverse site types, with explicit consideration of the dominance of obsidian quarries and lithic scatters . FRV Range/grazing management plan and market assessmentM The preserve's enabling legislation authorizes the grazing of livestock . Pursuant to Director's Order 53: Special Park Uses, a park unit that operates a grazing program must have a grazing management plan and conduct a market assessment to set grazing fees . FRV, OIRV, Key IssueComprehensive interpretive planM Currently, materials, displays, and programming are limited . This plan would provide a roadmap for the planning, designing, and developing of these interpretive materials, displays, and other programming activities . FRV, OIRV, Key Issue Integrated pest management plan M NPS staff have identified invasive species in the preserve (e .g ., cheat grass, thistles) that may cause further resource impacts if left unmitigated . Visitors, vehicles, grazing, and other ongoing preserve activities have the potential to serve as vectors for the introduction and spread of other nonnative invasive species in the future . The problem is further exacerbated by the wildfires that have occurred across more than 50% of the preserve since 2011 . An integrated pest management plan would also address rodent control in buildings and controlling plague in prairie dog towns .Foundation Document46Planning Needs - Where A Decision-Making Process Is Needed Related to an FRV, OIRV, or Key Issue?Planning NeedsPriority (H, M, L)Notes Key Issue Backcountry management planM The substantial and increasing human activities in the backcountry, including recreation, research, and administrative uses, must be evaluated and balanced with efforts to manage for other preserve values . Key Issue Accessibility conceptual site planM This plan would help the preserve address the current level of accessibility and identify opportunities for improvement . It would guide the planning for future projects and assure that universal design is incorporated into all projects and programs . Key Issue Accessibility self-evaluation and transition planM This plan would address compliance with Director's Order 42: Accessibility for Visitors with Disabilities in National Park Service Programs and Services. It would identify barriers that limit access to preserve programs, facilities, and services and transition strategies that could be employed until these barriers are removed . FRV Landscape restoration and stewardship planM This plan would review Valles Caldera Trust's current plan and environmental impact statement to assure it meets NPS compliance standards . FRV Invasive species management planM This plan would provide valuable tools, techniques, and methods to reduce the risk, and aid in the elimination or control, of invasive species and their impact on native wildlife and vegetation . FRV, OIRV, Key IssuePlanning for adaptation to climate changeM Scientific data show that Valles Caldera and the greater Jemez Mountains have increased in average temperature at a faster rate than surrounding areas of the state . Inventory and monitoring surveys and scientific equipment located on the preserve have been tracking these ongoing changes; however, more information is needed to assess the impacts these changes are having and will continue to have on the landscape . This plan is needed to inform land managers in their efforts to study and respond to the effects of rapidly changing climate at the high-elevation preserve . FRV Reintroduction of Rio Grande cutthroat trout plan M There is keen interest in the reintroduction of native fish species . This plan would assess the interaction of such fish with other species, evaluate differing approaches, and provide an opportunity for tribal and public input . FRV Bison introduction assessment and feasibility planM The preserve is within the historic range of plains bison and has substantial acreage of suitable habitat for the species . In addition, American Indian tribes and pueblos have a cultural connection to bison that could be explored and promoted in novel ways on the preserve . FRV Wellhead protection area planM This plan would guide immediate and long-term safety measures at several existing geothermal and groundwater wellhead sites . Key Issue Sustainability plan M This plan would assist the preserve in identifying and implementing actions for operational and visitor services environmentally sustainable processes .Valles Caldera National Preserve47Planning Needs - Where A Decision-Making Process Is Needed Related to an FRV, OIRV, or Key Issue?Planning NeedsPriority (H, M, L)Notes NA (operational)Disaster response plan M This plan would address potential disasters including wildfire, flooding, earthquake, uncontrolled radionuclide release from a nearby national laboratory, and volcanic eruption . It would assist the preserve in providing for the safety of preserve visitors and employees . NA (operational)Preservation maintenance planM NA (operational)Budget and staffing plan M NA(operational)Library services plan M NA (operational)Housing management planM Key Issue Commercial services strategyM This strategy would assist the preserve in identifying and establishing potential commercial operations within the preserve that are consistent with preservation, access, and visitor enjoyment . Key Issue Community and regional trails planM This plan would be done in collaboration with the NPS Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance Program . Key Issue Geologic resources management planM Geologic resources are central to the preserve's purpose and interpretation . Although extensive research has been conducted for several decades on the volcanic context of the caldera, paleontological resources within the preserve are understudied and have not been inventoried . In address, geologic knowledge has not been used to address resources management . Key Issue Sign management plan M This plan would be for both wayfinding and interpretive use . FRV Cultural landscape report M The report would synthesize the results of the cultural landscape inventory and provide guidance on preservation planning and priorities, development of historic districts and landscape treatments, and site planning, both preserve-wide and within the Cabin District . FRV Floodplain management planL This plan would help the preserve identify all of the floodplain information in relation to current infrastructure and potential new infrastructure and, based on that data, either modify existing plans or incorporate the information into new planning efforts . FRV New Mexico meadow jumping mouse recovery planL This plan would address the necessary environmental compliance and alternatives for assisting in the recovery of this native species to the ecosystem .Foundation Document48Planning Needs - Where A Decision-Making Process Is Needed Related to an FRV, OIRV, or Key Issue?Planning NeedsPriority (H, M, L)Notes FRV Wildfire recovery plan L This plan would help identify fire-prone areas within the preserve and determine the environmental consequences and mitigations for quick response to recovery efforts following a significant fire event . FRV Wilderness character assessmentL Although legacy human impacts, such as logging roads and geothermal exploration well pads, are present throughout the preserve, many areas still 1) appear as if the landscape has been affected primarily by the forces of nature, 2) have outstanding opportunities for solitude and a primitive/unconfined type of recreation, and 3) are of sufficient size as to make practicable their preservation and use in an unimpaired condition . This assessment would allow the preserve to analyze areas of the preserve that contain these wilderness characteristics as well as areas that could reclaim this character through ecological restoration efforts . NA (operational)Design guidelines and principlesL Key Issue Erosion control plan L Post-fire erosion is a significant problem in the preserve and poses several challenges for transportation and visitor access as well as resource impacts . NA (operational)Emergency management planL Key Issue Land protection plan L NA (operational)File management protocolL Valles Caldera National Preserve49Planning Needs - Where A Decision-Making Process Is NeededData Needs - Where Information Is Needed Before Decisions Can Be Made Related to an FRV, OIRV, or Key Issue?Data and GIS NeedsPriority of collections statementH Valles Caldera National Preserve has more than 15 years of cultural resources and natural history collections that require adequate curation and planning regarding retention and acquisitions of materials . The scope of collections statement is a necessary first step toward critically needed curation planning . FRV Ethnographic overview and assessment H The preserve currently consults with more than two dozen American Indian tribes and pueblos; however, an ethnographic study has never been completed . This assessment would help ensure the preserve is consulting with the appropriate tribal governments and has a clear understanding of the relationships between the landscape and indigenous peoples of the region . It also would identify culturally significant plant and animal species and the historic ranching cultures and use of structures . Key Issue Administrative history H From 2000 to 2015, the preserve was managed by an experimental federal land management agency, the Valles Caldera Trust . Developing a comprehensive administrative history of the predecessor agency would assist in preserving this history and interpreting the lessons that can be learned for future management of the preserve and other public lands . This planning exercise would be facilitated if it could be completed while the preserve maintains significant institutional knowledge of the Valles Caldera Trust within its personnel ranks . FRV Traditional cultural properties identificationH This study would facilitate tribal consultation and inform the preserve's tribal access practices . It is linked to the ethnographic overview and assessment and to understanding of traditional cultural places . FRV Site significance standards for lithic scatters and obsidian quarries H These archeological sites are extensive and ubiquitous throughout the preserve . Analysis and modelling of site characteristics and eligibility considerations are needed to develop significance standards applicable across the preserve . Use of this approach would facilitate cultural resources compliance and streamline planning . FRV Eagle survey H An inventory of eagle populations to establish the extent and health of migratory and roosting eagles (bald and golden eagles) is an important part of wildlife management and is needed to address expressed tribal concerns and requests . FRV Jemez Mountains salamander inventory and monitoring H The Jemez Mountains salamander is an endemic and endangered species . Inventory and assessment of habitat is critically needed for resource protection, preserve-wide planning, and climate change adaptation . FRV Least cost path analysis H These data would providing critical information for a trails management plan . The analysis would be substantively aided by a GIS analysis of potential routes across and within the preserve to achieve visitor access and recreation . Enabling legislation requires planning for a caldera rim trail . Foundation Document50Data Needs - Where Information Is Needed Before Decisions Can Be Made Related to an FRV, OIRV, or Key Issue?Data and GIS NeedsPriority (H, M, L)Notes FRV, Key IssueVisitor use information H Information such as surveys would be used to support and inform development of a visitor use management plan .

FRV Archeological overview and assessmentH Much of the preserve has not been surveyed or full assessments made of known sites and areas . These data would assist in managing these sensitive resources . Key Issue GIS analysis for trails, roads, and parking needsH GIS analysis is needed to support planning for circulation and visitor use . They would provide critical information for a trails management plan . This effort should include least cost path analysis, viewshed analysis, and assessments of potential routes across and within the preserve to achieve visitor access and recreation . Enabling legislation requires planning for a caldera rim trail . FRV Rim trail survey H The rim of the caldera needs to be surveyed for cultural and other resources in order to develop a rim trail, as required by the enabling legislation . Key Issue Assessment of long-term needs of individual historic structuresH Preservation planning, prioritization, and cost assessments are needed for historic structures to support visitor access planning, facilities protection plans, ADA-compliance, and pest management . FRV Catalog museum collectionsH Natural history and cultural resources collections are extensive from 2000 to 2015 and need to be cataloged for entry into NPS databases and to inventory the collections and to plan for their long-term management . Archeological collections are mostly inventoried, but historic archives and natural history collections are not . Accessioning and cataloging items are needed to plan for the proper curation of the collections . OIRV Data, GIS, and report standardization H An assessment of existing paper and digital materials is needed to develop library and database management policy and protocols and standardize past management efforts and applied science . FRV, Key IssueHistoric resource study H An inventory of historic resources of the preserve is needed to develop preservation plans and assess potential historic districts; to inform resources protection and interpretation; to establish the knowledge potential of historic phenomena; to support cultural landscapes inventory; and to develop historic context(s) for the preserve . This would be especially valuable for the Sulphur Springs area and the Cabin District .Valles Caldera National Preserve51Data Needs - Where Information Is Needed Before Decisions Can Be Made Related to an FRV, OIRV, or Key Issue?Data and GIS NeedsPriority (H, M, L)Notes OIRV Archives assessment H Technical assistance is needed to manage archival (non-object) and photography collections that date from 2000 to 2015 as well as to inform protocols for future acquisition of archives, especially in association with the oral history program and from scientifically significant geological studies conducted at the caldera from 1945 to the present . FRV, Key IssueHistoric building assessments/historic structure reportM The 2007 \"Historic Structures Documentation\" needs to be updated and reviewed to determine its sufficiency; determine if a historic structure report is needed; address and resolve gaps found; and complete entry into NPS databases to facilitate planning, use, and maintenance . FRV Cultural resources inventory and assessmentM A cultural resources inventory and assessment is needed to document and assess preserve features to contribute to planning, tribal consultation, and evaluation of traditionally cultural places . All areas above 9,600 feet elevation should be included . Cultural resources inventory and documentation are needed to support preserve-wide and project-specific planning efforts and to contribute to preservation planning . Currently, the cultural resource inventory for the preserve is less than 35% complete . FRV, OIRV, Key IssueClimate/weather monitoringM Temperature and precipitation monitoring has been ongoing at the preserve for more than a decade . Continuing and expanding this effort is essential for climate change planning and adaption, post-fire planning, and in support of forest, watershed, and animal habitat restoration efforts . FRV Soil survey M The soil survey for the preserve should be finalized and made available in final data/GIS formats . The soil survey conducted by Sandoval County and U .S . Forest Service is complete but is not in a product format that can be readily used by the National Park Service . Final products including GIS data and documentary materials need to be developed . FRV All-taxa biological inventoryM The all-taxa biological inventory (ATBI), primarily for soils biota and invertebrates, needs to be continued . FRV, OIRV Invasive species inventory M Inventories are needed assess the potential effects of livestock grazing, increased public visitation and vehicular circulation, and post-fire increases in invasive plant species . Non-plant invasive animals and other invasive organisms are almost unstudied, and baseline data are needed to establish monitoring programs . These data would be used to establish priorities and inform development of suitable prevention and control strategies .Foundation Document52Data Needs - Where Information Is Needed Before Decisions Can Be Made Related to an FRV, OIRV, or Key Issue?Data and GIS NeedsPriority (H, M, L)Notes FRV, OIRV, Key IssueAnalysis of drought stress across diverse ecosystem componentsM Long-term regional drought has had disproportional effects on the high-elevation ecosystems of the caldera . Inter-multi- species evaluations are needed to understand and address complex ecosystem responses across the forest, meadows, and riparian areas of the preserve and to inform restoration efforts and climate change adaption planning . Of particular concern are risks for sudden aspen population decline death; insect-aided damage to mid-sized-mortality of conifers; and stream-warming impacts that alter conditions for fisheries and other aquatic and riparian species . FRV Assessment of traditional cultural propertiesM The Valles Caldera and certain volcanic domes and peaks are considered sacred by many surrounding American Indian tribes and pueblos . Some locations may be eligible for designation as a traditional cultural property, and regional pueblos have called for action on this effort . FRV Traditional ecological knowledge studyM This study would identify and document the resources (natural and cultural) and places used by members of tribes and pueblos and the cultural basis for those uses . It would help the preserve manage access to and use of natural and/or cultural resources and places of cultural significance . FRV, Key IssueCultural landscapes inventoryM These inventories would identify, delineate, document, and assess the significance and integrity of cultural landscapes in the preserve . They would inform decision making for cultural landscapes designation(s) and are essential for several high- priority planning processes . FRV New Mexico meadow jumping mouse surveysM The presence of the New Mexico meadow jumping mouse (endangered species) in the preserve has not been confirmed despite the abundance of suitable habitat . Enhanced inventories are needed to better assess this endangered species . OIRV Complete tree survey M This ongoing data collection would aid in future fire planning and ecological restoration efforts . FRV GIS data on valle boundariesM GIS data and analysis are needed to establish baseline polygons of existing meadow outlines to facilitate analysis of historic meadow extents and to allow for future monitoring of any changes . FRV, Key IssueMapping of debris flow and encroachment into vallesM These GIS data would help in understanding the impacts and mitigation of fire events . FRV, Key IssueMapping of post-fire erosion and modeling of erosion risksM GIS mapping and modeling of erosion risk would aid in adaptive management of the caldera landscape and impacts . It would include a full analysis of roads and their subsequent erosional risks .

FRV Visual resource inventory M The visual resource inventory would identify view quality and importance, establish baseline conditions, and be used to develop view protection strategies . FRV, Key IssueContinued monitoring of streams and water qualityM Ongoing stream and water quality monitoring should continue to document changes relative to climate change, fire disturbances, restoration, and other drivers and to inform adaptive management . FRV Elk research M These data would support possible ungulate management planning efforts . Data would include pregnancy rates, calving populations, and related studies . FRV Rio Grande cutthroat trout monitoring and studyM This study would support planning for introduction of the Rio Grande cutthroat trout . FRV Updated vegetation mapping (post-fires)M An updated vegetation inventory is needed to incorporate and monitor changes resulting from wildfires . FRV Inventory and mapping of noxious weed speciesM Key Issue Quality control / assurance and analysis of GIS dataM A compilation is needed of GIS data for prior fire and restoration treatment areas and fires since 2000 . FRV Baseline data and monitoring for soundscapes, dark night sky, and air quality M Critical baseline information for future planning efforts and visitor experience is needed . Collection of these data is underway . The preserve is developing a monitoring plan that would continue data collection into the future and establish a monitoring protocol . FRV Collect and curate historic USGS materials and data M Historic documents and materials would enhance interpretation of the vital role Valles Caldera National Preserve has played in the history of geological science . This should be collated into a scientific bibliography . Historic USGS photography can provide information on landscape transformations . FRV Evaluation of existing earthen damsM Stock tanks and other water impoundments throughout the preserve have not been adequately evaluated for safety, resources effects, or recreation potential . FRV Pika population trends M Pika are especially sensitive to climate warming, and baseline data and monitoring are needed to evaluate population health, habitat, and long-term risks . Foundation Document54Data Needs - Where Information Is Needed Before Decisions Can Be Made Related to an FRV, OIRV, or Key Issue?Data and GIS NeedsPriority (H, M, L)Notes FRV Analysis of culturally significant speciesM Numerous animals that use the preserve have value and meaning to diverse populations in surrounding communities, including tribal groups . A better understanding of these cultural values is needed to inform wildlife management . FRV Analysis of predator communities and interactionsM The role of predators in wildlife ecosystem processes has not been fully studied at the preserve . Understanding how bears, lions, and coyotes fit into the larger Jemez Mountains ecosystem would inform on wildlife management planning, including hunting plans, for predators and prey species . OIRV Assessment of tree stressorsM This assessment would include impacts from drought and pest insects . OIRV, Key IssueInventory and protocols for monitoring geologic features M FRV Beaver monitoring and habitat study L This study would assess existing beaver populations in the preserve and design a plan for detection of new individuals . FRV Monitor riparian restoration, tree planting survival, and resulting effects for streams and associated understory vegetation communityL FRV, Key IssueStudy of temporal The persistence of the grassland-forest ecotone is an iconic component of caldera viewsheds; further study of the conditions contributing to this inverted tree line would enhance the understanding of this key topographic-ecological feature and improve interpretation for visitors .

Several oral histories have been collected but need to be transcribed and synthesized to be most useful for historic and socioeconomic interpretation and for landscape analyses . FRV, Key IssueHistoric photo analysis L Analysis of aerial imagery from 1935 to 2014 would inform forest and watershed restoration programs and cultural landscape inventories . Valles Caldera National Preserve55Data Needs - Where Information Is Needed Before Decisions Can Be Made Related to an FRV, OIRV, or Key Issue?Data and GIS NeedsPriority (H, M, L)Notes OIRV Dendrochronology study of culturally marked treesL Culturally marked trees are present in great abundance throughout the preserve and are a key information source on historic land use . Carvings on the older aspen trees are at high and increasing risk of being lost due to senescence, elk damage, and wildfire . FRV Synthesis of Jemez Mountains obsidian sources and hydration sources in the Jemez Mountains, including within Valles Caldera National Preserve, are of critical importance for understanding regional and national trade and transport in prehistory . Although geochemical analyses exist for the array of Jemez obsidian sources, detailed analyses for sources inside the caldera are incomplete . Obsidian hydration dating, a significant chronometric technique for archeology, can now only provide relative dates; analysis and calculation of source-specific hydration rates would enable using this dating technique to determine absolute dates for archeological assemblages in the caldera, in the Jemez Mountains, and across the Midwestern and Southwestern United States . Additional sampling and geochemical analysis of obsidian-bearing geological areas are needed to determine intra-source variation and allow these syntheses . FRV Earthworm survey L Three species of European earthworms are known to be present in the preserve, but a comprehensive inventory is needed to determine all species present and to assess the role of these nonnatives for potential significant changes in grassland and forest ecosystem functioning, litter processing and soil nutrient cycling, and transformations of buried archeological deposits . FRV, OIRV, Key IssueUpdate LiDAR coverage to measure current post- fire erosion and monitor stream channel changes L LiDAR surveys conducted in 2010 and 2012 need to be augmented with 2020 LiDAR to inform viewshed analysis, monitor stream channel alteration, and measure post-fire erosion and vegetation change . FRV Inventory of non-biotic resourcesL Inventory and analysis of minerals and paleontology has not been initiated, and paleontological resources have not been inventoried . This baseline information is needed for resource protection planning and for potential interpretation .

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. (a) S HORT TITLE.\u2014This Act may be cited as the ''Carl Levin and Howard P. 'Buck' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015''. (b) F INDINGS .\u2014Congress makes the following findings: (1)(A) Senator Carl Levin of Michigan was elected a member of the United States Senate on November 7, 1978, for a full term beginning January 3, 1979. He has served continuously in the Senate since that date, and was appointed as a member of the Committee on Armed Services in January 1979. He has served on the Committee on Armed Services since that date, a period of nearly 36 years. (B) A graduate of Detroit Central High School, Senator Levin went on to Swarthmore College, and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1959, gaining admittance to the Michigan bar. He served his State as assistant attorney general and general counsel of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission from 1964-1967, and later served his hometown of Detroit as a member of the Detroit City Council from 1969-1973, and as the council's president from 1974-1977. (C) Senator Levin first served as chairman of the Com- mittee on Armed Services of the United States Senate for a period of the 107th Congress, and has remained chairman since the 110th Congress began in 2007. He has exercised extraordinary leadership as either the chairman or ranking minority member of the committee since the start of the 105th Congress in 1997. (D) Each year, for the past 52 years, the Committee on Armed Services has reliably passed an annual defense authorization act, and this will be the 36th that Senator Levin has had a role in. In his capacity as member, ranking member, and chairman, he has been an advocate for a strong national defense, and has made lasting contributions to the security of our Nation. (E) It is altogether fitting and proper that this Act, the last annual authorization act for the national defense that Senator Levin manages in and for the United States Senate Carl Levin and Howard P.

The enabling legislation highlights access to traditional cultural and religious sites by members of American Indian tribes or pueblos for traditional cultural and customary uses, and explicitly provides for protection of traditional cultural and religious sites through limitations on the use of volcanic domes and peaks. The National Park Service seeks to proactively pursue these goals by strengthening its engagement with tribal communities, and increasing the active and collaborative involvement of tribes in management planning, stewardship, and tribal access and use of the preserve. The following list is inclusive of all tribes or pueblos the preserve has previously contacted for tribal consultation; appropriate studies and consultations are needed to establish traditionally associated people and cultural affiliations to park resources.
