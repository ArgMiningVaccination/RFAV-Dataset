More than half of US adults experience bleeding gums, a common sign of gingivitis. [Gingivitis is an early form of periodontal disease](https://www.rejuvdentist.com/biological-dentistry/gingivitis-vs-periodontitis/), also called periodontitis. Untreated gingivitis can lead to all sorts of [whole body health issues](https://www.rejuvdentist.com/biological-dentistry/mouth-body-connection/), most notably heart diseases. Although a dental hygienist can recommend multiple treatments for gingivitis, there are also several effective home remedies for gingivitis. If you're between check-ups and are concerned you may be developing gingivitis, you can try these methods at home. (We know a lot of people [want to avoid the dentist](https://www.rejuvdentist.com/dental-anxiety/fear-of-dentist/) if they can.) What is the fastest way to cure gingivitis? The fastest way to cure gingivitis is to maintain daily oral hygiene, avoid sugary foods and foods high in acids, drink plenty of water, and practice effective home treatment. Check out these 9 science-backed home remedies, and say goodbye to gingivitis. #1. Oil Pulling You may have heard of oil pulling. It's growing in popularity, and there's a surprising amount of scientific evidence behind it. Oil pulling is when you swish coconut oil in your mouth to [improve oral hygiene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7475120/). Coconut oil swishing [can effectively](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4382606/) decrease plaque buildup and fight inflammation of the gums. How can I treat gingivitis at home? You can treat gingivitis at home with alternative treatments like oil pulling and a salt water rinse \u2014 both of which have almost no side effects, unlike alcohol-based mouthwashes. How to do oil pulling: - Swish about 1 tablespoon of coconut oil in your mouth for 5 minutes. It should turn into a liquid in your mouth. Don't swallow any of the coconut oil. - Once you're done, spit the coconut oil into the trash. It will turn into a solid at room temperature, so it's safe for the garbage can. Don't spit it down the drain. - Rinse out your mouth. As you get used to oil pulling, increase your swish time from 5 minutes to 15 minutes. You can also try [Arimedadi oil pulling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5020187/), another Ayurvedic tactic similar to coconut oil pulling but with less scientific evidence behind it. #2. Salt Water Rinse A salt water mouth rinse can help treat gingivitis and ease symptoms. This [2016 study shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4956236/) that a salt water rinse helps treat wounds on the gum line caused by gingivitis. A [newer study shows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7793524/) \"that the use of a sea salt-based mouthwash in daily oral hygiene reduces the bacterial levels\" that contribute to gingivitis \u2014 although that newer study also incorporated xylitol and lysozyme. Can you get rid of gingivitis on your own? Yes, you can get rid of gingivitis on your own with home remedies like oil pulling to kill the bad bacteria and a salt water rinse to heal the gingival wounds. A salt water mouth rinse also helps [heal your gums](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34916636/) after gum surgery, including minimally invasive periodontal surgery to treat gingivitis. This further shows how salt water can heal your gums.

A 2015 study showed that a 0.25% lemongrass [performed marginally better](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4625327/) than mouthwash at reducing dental plaque and gingival status. A newer study further concluded that lemongrass oil mouthwash may be effective in the \" [treatment of chronic periodontitis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5615015/) and [prevention] of cardiovascular diseases.\" Remember, periodontitis is another term for gingivitis.

Once you're done, spit it out down the drain. - Repeat up to 3 times a day until your gums don't feel tender. #5. Topical Turmeric Gel Turmeric is an anti-inflammatory compound that [may prevent gingivitis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4668736/). Its chief constituent is curcmunin, which boasts many health benefits, including dental health. Your digestive tract destroys a lot of the curcumin in turmeric, but using turmeric on your gums maintains much of the healing curcumin. A [2016 scientific review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27863601/) revealed that turmeric may be effective at \"preventing and treating gingivitis.\" How to make and use a topical turmeric gel: - Mix 1 teaspoon of turmeric (or curcuma) with a little warm water.

Some suggest combining baking soda, turmeric, and salt to rub on their gums. View this post on Instagram #6.

A comparative study concluded that mouthwashes containing clove oil (among other essential oils) were \" [beneficial clinically as](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4095623/) antiplaque and antigingivitis agents.\" Clove has definite potential to be used for its anti-plaque and anti-inflammatory properties [in the treatment of gingivitis](http://www.scielo.org.za/pdf/sadj/v70n3/10.pdf).
