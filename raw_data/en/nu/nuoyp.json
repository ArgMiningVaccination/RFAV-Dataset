Description The Arts and Sciences housed in the School include degree programs in Biology, English, Fashion Merchandising, General Studies, Lit- erature and Civilization (with concentrations in History, Philosophy), Health Sciences and Psychology, Mathematics, and Music. In ad- dition, the School is responsible for those courses in composition, humanities, fine arts and natural sciences, mandated by the Uni- versity's core curriculum. The School is committed to an interdisciplin- ary approach that it believes best prepares students for the challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century, and for graduate school. The Biology Program is designed to pre- pare students for further study in graduate or professional schools, or for employment in education, industry, or governmental service. Students may follow a general biology cur - riculum or elect an option in pre-chiropractic, pre-medicine, pre-dentistry, pre-naturopathy, pre-veterinary, marine biology, or zoology. The General Studies Program gives adult learners, as well as traditional undergradu- ates, greater flexibility in completing their studies by offering broad areas of disciplin- ary concentration in place of more traditional majors. Students use this option to pursue ca-reers in business and social science and as a pre-professional degree. The First Year Studies Program develops, promotes, and administers programs and ser - vices for under prepared freshmen, who are given the opportunity to demonstrate their true ability. Students remain in the program for one to four semesters depending on their level of achievement. They use the record they have compiled to transfer into their ma- jor of choice at the University. The Health Sciences Program prepares stu- dents for entry level positions in exercise and fitness, and in nutrition, as well as for advanced study in pharmacy, physician as-45sistant, nursing, and other professional pro- grams in the health sciences. The curriculum in this program includes basic foundation courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics as well as in required courses in philosophy and psychology. The Human Services Program combines theoretical coursework with fireld work ex- perience to prepare students for careers in human service agencies and community or - ganizations. The program requires students to supplement their course work in the hu- man services and gerontology with courses in psychology, sociology, and related fields. The Literature and Civilization Program gives students a general foundation in the liberal arts while, at the same time, examining the connections within and between them. With-in this major, students may opt for a concen- tration in Creative Writing, English, History, Philosophy. The Mathematics Program is designed to pre- pare the student for graduate work in math- ematics and allied areas, industrial employ- ment, secondary school teaching, and careers in quantitative areas of biological and social sciences. The Medical Laboratory Science program pre- pares students for careers in a hospital labora- tory with opportunities for growth in research or molecular diagnostics. The MLS Program may also serve as a pre-med or pre-physician assistant training program. In addition to the specific medical laboratory science, biology, and chemistry courses required for the pro- gram, students will demonstrate competency in foundation courses in biology, chemistry, and mathematics as well as in required cours- es in philosophy and psychology. The Music Program offers four distinct four- year programs leading to the Bachelor and Music degree: Music Education, Performance, Jazz Studies, and Music Business. Music stu-dents are required to complete music foun- dation courses and one of the four concen- trations. The Music Business concentration reflects the growing complexity of the com- mercial music scene. The Psychology Program gives students a knowledge of the general areas of develop- mental, personality, social, cognitive, and ab- normal psychology, preparing them for em-ployment in psychology and related fields or for further study in graduate programs. The program permits ancillary study in related subject areas in the human services, the hu- manities, the social sciences, and biology. The School provides courses in Physics and Chemistry in support of the University's Sci- ence and Engineering programs. Facilities The music programs are housed in the Ar - nold Bernhard Center which provides class-room performance, and lecture hall space. Individual students have access to spacious studio and practice areas The Biology and Mathematics program are located in Dana Hall. Three floors are oc-cupied by Biology, Physics, Chemistry, and Geology laboratories. Internships, Co-operative Programs and Professional Opportunities The School offers students a variety of op- tions dependent on their major interests. In the Humanities programs there are oppor - tunities for internships with state and local government organizations, newsprint and broadcast media, advertising agencies, and related commercial interests. The University's proximity to New York City, the media, art, and design center of the United States and the site of many museums, foundations and research institutes, offers students an excep- tional variety of intellectual, cultural, and professional experiential learning possibili-ties. Our students are actively participating in summer programs in Biology, and working part-time in many corporate and consulting companies locally and nationally. Accreditation All degree programs in the School of Arts and Sciences are licensed and accredited by the State of Connecticut Office of Higher Education. Admission Criteria and Procedures A student is admitted to the majors in Arts and Sciences after an evaluation of the high school transcript, counselor recommenda-tions, and SAT/ACT scores and has dem- onstrated potential in analytical reasoning, comprehension, verbal expression and in- tellectual growth. In addition to the standard University re- quirements, admission to the majors in Mu- sic may require the submission of a portfolio representing the applicant's creative work, or a tape/video-cassette representing perfor - mance skills. Students who perform well in the Biology and Mathematics programs are generally found to have met the following criteria: A. SAT scores of 530(R) verbal and 560(R) math; or composite ACT score of 22. B. Grade point average of \"B\", (2.5) or bet-ter. C. Rank in the top half of the high school graduating class. D. Four years of mathematics; two lab sci- ences and an additional science unit in high school. At the discretion of the Admissions Commit- tee, students who meet two out of the above standards can be admitted into the major. Admissions Criteria and Procedures for the First Year Studies Program Students who aspire to one of the majors at the University, but whose academic perfor - mance in high school suggests developmen-tal needs, are considered for admission to the Program in First Year Studies based on a review of their high school record, standard- ized test scores, and supporting documents (special attention is paid to recommenda- tions and the applicant's essay). For information concerning admission pro- cedures, please refer to the section on Uni- versity Admissions. General Criteria for Degrees from the School of Arts and Sciences Degree in English, Literature and Civiliation, and General Studies require a minimum of 120 semester hours of acceptable work. De-School of Arts and Sciences46pending on the degree and program, thirty to forty-eight semester hours may be devot- ed to the major, and at least half of these must be completed at the University unless this requirement is waived by the School Dean. The exact number of semester hours required for each major is listed in the sec-tion of the catalog entitled \"Undergraduate Degree Programs.\" In Music, the Bachelor of Music degree re- quires a minimum of 126 semester hours. At the end of each semester, music majors must take an examination in their applied area before a jury of the faculty. At the close of the fourth semester, each music major is given a sophomore review. This review is a comprehensive critique of academic and applied work completed to date and deter - mines whether the candidate continues as a music major. In Biology and Mathematics majors the Bachelor's degree is awarded to the student who fulfills the following minimum require-ments, in addition to those listed in the chapter on Academic Regulations. 1. Participation in such departmental semi- nars as the faculty prescribes. 2. Earning the total semester hours required for the individual curriculum as listed in the following pages. 3. Earning a \"C-\" or better in every course in the major and with a cumulative aver - age of 2.0 in the major courses. Each department designates the courses to be included in the major and decides the procedure necessary to remove each deficiency, including any \"D\" in a major course. When a course is a prerequisite to another, a \"C-\" or better in the prereq- uisite course may also be a requirement. Both B.S. and B.A. degrees are available in Biology and Mathematics.First Year Studies Program The First Year Studies Program (FYSP) is an academic unit which, utilizing a variety of support services, facilitates the transition of first-year students from high school to uni-versity life. Program advisors assist the stu- dents in the selection of appropriate courses while preparing them for admission into the major of their choice. The FYSP team attempts to foster within their students a spirit of intellectual curios- ity, personal responsibility, and commitment to academic excellence. The FYSP is housed in the School of Arts and Sciences but is designed to prepare the under prepared student for majors in any of the Schools at the University of Bridgeport. The Program emphasizes strengthening study skills and awareness of college cul- ture and protocol. Because these factors are essential for successful completion of a col- lege degree, students in the FYSP must ad- here to stringent academic and attendance guidelines. Support is provided in the form of intense advising, communication with the professors, and use, in some cases manda-tory, of the Academic Resource Center. It is the goal of the First Year Studies Program to prepare its students for acceptance into the desired majors by the time they successfully complete their first thirty credits.

TImE lImITATIon AnD pR oGRAm conTInUITY All requirements for the degree of Master of Science must be completed within six years (twelve consecutive semesters) of the effec- tive start of an approved graduate program of study. Once a program is initiated, the student must maintain continuous enroll- ment until completion. Under certain circumstances, a student may be granted permission to interrupt his/ her program by petitioning the Dean in writing, stating the underlying circumstances. Pro- gram interruption without formal permission will constitute grounds for dismissal from the Graduate School. DEGREE pR oGRAm REQUIREmEnTS All graduate students must have on file an approved program of study on the form provided. Programs of study are worked out between the student and his/her advi-sor to meet both the student's desires and the graduate faculty's philosophy of an in- tegrated program. The program of study must carry the approval of the chair of the department awarding the degree. Changes in the approved program of study must be approved by the student's program advisor and the department Chair. EnGInEERInG colloQUIUm REQUIREmEnT All Engineering students are required to register for the Engineering Colloquia Se- ries (ENGR 400) once during their course of study. Students are expected to register in their first semester. Students who do not pass the course are required to repeat the course in a subsequent semester. GEnERAl ThESIS REGUlATIonS MS Students are encouraged to include a thesis investigation in their approved pro- gram of study. Accumulation of thesis se-mester hours and work done during a thesis investigation must be continuous up to the time of its completion. Only those students designated as regular graduate students who have satisfied the following require-School of Engineering54ments will be permitted to accumulate thesis credits. During the semester prior to that in which the student desires to initiate his/her thesis investigation, he/she must have: 1. Included a thesis investigation in his/her approved program of study; 2. Sought and obtained a member of the graduate faculty who agrees to act as his/ her thesis advisor; 3. Submitted a completed thesis investiga- tion form to the department in which the degree is to be awarded; 4. Obtained a Thesis Committee, appoint- ed by the department chair, consisting of three members of the graduate fac- ulty (including the advisor as committee chair). Students should obtain a copy of \"Specifica-tions for Master's Thesis\" from the office of the department chair which describes re- quirements in detail. All theses in Engineering must be presented at a faculty-graduate seminar. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that this requirement is fulfilled, and that written notice of the pre- sentation is distributed to all interested per - sons at least one week before the event. Students who are in the process of completing a thesis are required to register for at least two semester hours of thesis in each semester, in-cluding summer, that they actively engage in that activity under faculty guidance. Semester hours thus accumulated that total more than the approved program of-study requirement are not counted toward the degree. This procedure does not apply to Electrical Engineering, where students have up to 3 se- mesters (not counting the summer semester) to start and finish their project/thesis. For every semester they are not registered for any cred- its, they must take ELEG 596 (seminar) for 1 credit. They do not take ELEG 596 in the sum-mer semester, unless it is their last semester. Upon successful completion of the thesis, and acceptance by the Thesis Committee, pro-vided all other requirements in the program of study are completed, the student becomes eligible for the degree.complETIon oF mASTER'S DEGREE The Master of Science degree will be award- ed only to those students successfully com- pleting the following requirements: 1. A minimum of 31 semester hours (34 hours for Technology Management) with a QPR of \"B\" or better in an approved program of study. The number of semes- ter hours which may be transferred from another institution is an individual matter that will be reviewed by the major de- partment, but is normally no more than 6 semester hours. 2. Satisfactory completion of the state licen-sure requirements as prescribed by the faculty of the major department, and a fa- vorable recommendation from the facul-ty upon review of the student's program and performance, after the student has made formal application for a Master's diploma. When the degree is completed with a thesis, a minimum of eight courses of three semes- ter hours each are required for the Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering or Mechanical Engineering. For the Master of Science in Computer Science or Computer Engineering, nine courses of three semester hours each plus six semester hours (mini- mum) of thesis are required. For the Master of Science degree in Technology Management, nine courses of three semester hours each plus six semester hours (minimum) of thesis are required; for students holding the Bach-elor of Science in Manufacturing Engineering or Industrial Engineering from an approved program, this requirement may be reduced to eight courses of three semester hours each, plus six semester hours (minimum) of thesis. coopERATIVE EDUcATIon pRoGRAm The School of Engineering offers an option- al cooperative education program.

Yelle Arnold Bernhard Center, room Management (M.P.S.) Graphic Design (B.F.A.) Concentration in New Media Industrial Design (B.A.)Interior Design (B.A.) Mission Statement In keeping with a 60-year history of excel- lence, the mission of the Shintaro Akatsu School of Design (SASD) is to offer profes- sional education in the design fields lead-ing to baccalaureate degrees and successful careers in design. SASD develops students' abilities to identify, analyze, and solve de-sign problems using culturally sensitive and environmentally sustainable methodologies and technologies. SASD is committed to ad- vancing the use of best-practices in all areas of design. Professional Environment Each student has a space for in-class assign-ments with an adjacent computer design studio, a clean room for large-scale mock- ups and a well-equipped model shop and a photography studio. In addition to the full time faculty, practicing professional design- ers are invited to teach studio courses ensur - ing that the student receives a practical and current education. Portfolio Focus An important semester event is the Open House; professional designers are invited to a portfolio review in a celebration of the stu- dent's semester work. An aggressive sum-mer internship program for the sophomore and junior students is key to their profes- sional success. The senior thesis reinforces this internship experience. With the com-bination of a professional, robust portfolio and extensive internship experience our graduates are well prepared for an exciting and fulfilling career.Computer Emphasis We have a strong Computer Aided Design (CAD) emphasis balanced by traditional skill development. We use powerful programs that include Vellum 3D, formZ, Photoshop, Illustrator, IronCAD, Alias Studio, Maya, Final Cut Pro, Premiere, Flash, and Solid- works. An example of our cutting-edge use of technology is in the Junior design studio, where students use the computer to directly create prototypes using stereolithography through a local high technology company. Local Innovation Connecticut has a spectacular history of in-novation, invention, engineering, illustra- tion, and design. Connecticut has the high- est patents per capita. Many well-established corporations and a rapidly growing array of new high technology companies are in the immediate area. Bridgeport Machines, Dictaphone, Pitney Bowes, Remington, and Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation are next door and the World Headquarters of General Elec-tric is in the nearby town of Fairfield. Evo, Product Ventures, Group Four Design, and 9th Wave are just a sample of the consulting animation, advertising, and interior design firms a short distance from Bridgeport.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which encompasses acupuncture, manual therapy, diet counseling, herbal therapies, exercise and breathing techniques, has been in use for thou- sands of years. Over the millennia, the Asian community has continuously refined this an- cient healing art. During the last century, this refinement has included integration of Western medical sciences within the paradigm of TCM.mS-A c The development of the Master of Science in Acupuncture degree program integrates the medical concepts of both the East and West. The student will learn classical acupuncture and Traditional Chinese medical theory as well as up-to-date western bio-medical sciences. The Master of Science in Acupuncture degree program's goal is to provide acupuncture and Traditional Chinese medical training consistent with the developing traditions in Asia and the growing modern health care system in the United States. Having an opportunity to work alone and in conjunction with other health care practitioners in the Health Sciences Center, the students will be able to integrate the care of patients with other health care providers. Thus, the student gains a \"real world\" advantage before entering private practice. mS-Tcm The MS-TCM is a 4-year program during which the students are instructed in Chinese Herbol-ogy during three (3) of the four (4) years of training, after a first year of basic sciences, theory and diagnosis classes lay the founda-tion for understanding the art and science of a full range of TCM modalities. All foundational courses and clinical rotations from the MS-AC program are included in the MS-TCM. The nearly 3400-hours of training in Tradi- tional Chinese Medicine modalities, including excellent training in acupuncture, moxibus- tion, tui na as well as Chinese herbal studies is designed to produce graduates with exem-plary clinical skills. The clinical focus of this program is evident from the very first classes and permeates all the training in the MS-TCM program. The MS-TCM program is a residential pro- gram with students completing over 80% of their course work and 100% of their clinical rotations in residence. The ASIAN/CHINESE HERBOLOGY (ACH) courses will be offered in a blended format with 50% of the didac- tic program offered online and 50% during 4 weekends each semester, and an additional 3 weekends each summer for a total of 11 week- ends a year. Students will participate in an on- line environment to complete their ASIAN/CHINESE HERBOLOGY studies. mS-ch The MS-CH program is a stand-alone program that will allow licensed health care profes-sionals to better understand Chinese Herbol- ogy and be able to safely utilize these herbal products. Currently, many healthcare professionals are able to prescribe herbal therapies (MDs, NDs, DCs, L.Acs) or work with herbal thera-pies (PharmDs). UB MS-CH program is the only clinically-oriented systematic masters- level program for health professionals in these therapies.

The student becomes proficient in the theories pertinent to Chinese Herbal Medicine and the clinical applications of Chinese materia medica for a wide variety of clinical situations and patient popula-tions. At the completion of the 10 course survey, students will have learned over 300 individual herbs and over 150 differ - ent classical and patent formulae. 3. RElATED AREAS: The three (3) required courses in ethics, TCM diagnosis and evidence-informed clinical practices help practitioners better understand their patients, the evidence for TCM therapies, possible interactions and the ethics related to TCM clinical practice.Acupuncture Institute664. clInIcAl EDUcATIon: The four (4) Chinese Herbology clinical services are designed to allow the student to develop clinical, interpersonal com-munication and decision-making skills. From inception through the end of clinical training, the student has the opportunity to observe and work with advanced TCM practitioners. Clinical service rotations are available in the UBAI on-campus clinic as well as in community outreach clinical sites. By the end of clinical training, each student will have seen a minimum of 200 patient visits and will have completed 360 hours in the herbology clinic). cURRIcUlUm - mS-chinese herbology SEMESTER 1 AHM 613 TCM Dietetics 2 0 36 2 ACS 511 Evidence Informed Practices 1 0 18 1 ACH 511 Chinese Herb Formulae for Channel Obstructions 2 0 36 2 ACH 512 Chinese Herb Formulae for Common Ailments 2 0 36 2 ACC 611 Herb Clinic 1 0 4 130 2.5 Total: 7 4 256 9.5 SEMESTER 2 ATD 524 TCM Diagnosis 2 2 0 36 2 ACH 523 Chinese Herbal Theories & Triple burner theories 1.5 0 27 1.5 ACH 524 Chinese Herbs for Exogenous disease patterns 2.5 0 45 2.5 AWB 621 Medical Ethics 1 0 18 1 ACC 632 Herb Clinic 2A 0 2 65 1.5 Total: 7 2 191 8.5 SUMMER SESSION ACH 635 Clinical Application of Herbs 1 2 0 36 2 ACH 636 Chinese Formulae 1 2 0 36 2 AHM 634 Dispensary Management 1 0 18 1 AHM 635 Pharmcognosy & Pharmacy of Chinese Herbs 1 0 18 1 Total: 6 0 108 6 SEMESTER 3 ACH 617 Clinical Application of Herbs 2 2 0 36 2 ACH 619 Chinese Formulae 2 2 0 36 2 AHM 616 Ethical and ecological considerations of materia medica 1 0 18 1 ACC 723 Chinese Herb Clinic 2B 0 2 65 1.5 ACC 724 Chinese Herb Clinic 3 0 3 100 2 Total: 5 5 255 8.5SEMESTER 4 ACH 628 Clinical Application of Herbs 3 2 0 36 2 ACH 641 Chinese Formulae 3 2 0 36 2 Total: 4 0 72 4 Total All Semesters: 882 hours/36.5 credits ELECTIVES: 18 1 AHM 521 Botanical Medicine 2 0 36 2 ATD 711 Differential Dx and Pathomechanisms 2 0 36 2 conTA cT hoUR bY AREA: HERBAL MEDICINE SURVEY .....................

The third digit indicates the area. E.g.: APT 524 APT: Acupuncture Practice and Techniques 5 - year one2 - second semester4 - fourth course in the area sequence Grades Grades earned by students are submitted to the Registrar utilizing the following designa- tions. Grades earned are on a four (4) point scale with a grade of \"A\" or 4 quality points being the highest grade attained. Grades with quality points are: GRADE QUAlITY poInTS A 4.0 B+ 3.5 B 3.0 C+ 2.5C 2.0 D 1.0 F 0.0The cumulative quality point ratio (QPR) is determined by dividing the number of semes- ter hours into the number of points earned. Transfer credits are not included in this com- putation. Administrative Grades In addition to the academic grades submitted by faculty, the following Administrative Grades are also utilized. I: The grade of Incomplete \"I\" is used by the faculty to indicate that a student has not completed all course require- ments. A student will have one week from the first day of the next term to meet with the faculty and complete all course requirements unless other arrangements are made with either 67the faculty member or the program Director prior to the end of the term in which the course was taken. Upon completion of the course require-ments the faculty will submit the earned grade. Failure by the student to meet with the faculty and complete the requirements in one week from the first day of the next term will re- sult in a grade of \"I\" being converted to a grade of \"F\". Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will be required to register for and re-take that course in its entirety when the course is regularly scheduled. Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will not be able to register for courses for which that course is a prerequisite. R: Students may repeat a course at any grade level below an \"A\". The first re- peat will replace the first-time grade for the computation of the QPR. TCR: This indicates transfer credit granted for equivalent work completed at an- other accredited institution. W: Withdrawal grades are assigned on the following policy statements: 1. If the student officially withdraws from a course during the official change-of-registration period, that course does not appear on the stu-dent's transcript. 2. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the end of the change-of-registration period, but before the end of the official with- drawal period, a grade of \"W\" is assigned and that course remains on the student's transcript. Courses with a grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR and do not count towards \"hours attempted.\" 3. The names of students who have officially withdrawn from a course and receive the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the balance of the semester. 4. Any exceptions to the above, in-cluding late withdrawals, must be approved by the Director and the Provost before they become official and are recorded. Poor academic performance does not constitute a valid reason for late withdrawal.Academic Policies ATTEnDAncE REQUIREmEnTS: Each student is expected to attend all lectures, laboratories and other activities associated with the total completion of a given course. A student who is absent from class in excess of ten percent of the total class hours may have his or her grade reduced for lack of partici- pation as outlined in the course syllabus. A student absent in excess of twenty percent of the total class hours will receive a grade of \"F.\" Requirements for Graduation - mS- Ac In order to be eligible for graduation from the Acupuncture Institute program, candidates must meet the following criteria: 1. Have successfully completed a minimum of 34 months of resident study in an ac- credited institution. The last 2 semesters (34 credits) must have been in residence at the University of Bridgeport Master of Science in Acupuncture degree program. 2. Have successfully completed all require- ments of the educational program and have achieved a 2.75 cumulative grade point average. 3. Have been recommended for graduation by the faculty and the administration. 4. Have satisfactorily met all financial ob-ligations to the Acupuncture Institute degree program, the Office of Financial Aid, commencement exercises and other University of Bridgeport offices. 5. Have passed the Clinical Entrance Exam with a score of no less than 75%, the Clinical Exit Exam and all practical clini- cal examinations with a grade of 70% or better. Graduation requirements mS-Tcm: 1. Have successfully completed a minimum of 46 months of resident study in an ac-credited institution. The last 2 semesters (34 credits) must have been in residence at the University of Bridgeport Master of Science in Traditional Chinese Medicine degree program. 2. Complete all required coursework with a grade of \"C\" or better3. Complete all clinical hours 4. Complete all clinical competencies 5. Successfully pass clinical exams, includ-ing the clinical entrance exam (pass 75%), all modules of the clinical exit exam (6 modules, 70% to pass for each section), clinical practical points exam, clinical practical needling exam, clinical practical formulations exam 6. Complete an exit interview 7. Recommendation from the clinic director 8. Recommendation from the program di- rector 9. No student will graduate from the pro- gram who has not resolved all financial obligations with the University of Bridge- port Graduation requirements mS-ch: 1. Complete all required coursework with a grade of \"C\" or better 2. Complete all clinical hours 3. Complete all clinical competencies 4. Successfully pass clinical exams, includ-ing the clinical entrance exam (pass 75%), all modules of the clinical exit exam (3 modules, 70% to pass for each section), pass the clinical practical for - mulations exam 5. Complete an exit interview 6. Recommendation from the program di-rector 7. No student will graduate from the pro- gram who has not resolved all financial obligations with the University of Bridge-port GooD A cADEmIc STAnDInG Good academic standing is achieved when a student is maintaining good grades, has met all financial responsibilities to the Acupuncture Institute degree program, and is not guilty of any breach of standards governing ethical and clinical conduct. AcADEmIc pR obATIon Academic probation occurs when the student's cumulative grade point average falls below the Acupuncture Institute68required grade point average of 2.50 or if a student receives one grade of \"F\" or two or more grades of \"D\" during a single semester. A student who is on academic probation is not in good academic standing and is not eli - gible to carry a full academic course load. AcADEmIc REmEDIATIon A student who is on Academic Probation will be placed in a program of Academic Reme- diation and will be required to meet with the Director of the Institute. Academic Reme-diation requires a student to carry a reduced academic load. Students will be permitted to convert grades of \"D\" or \"F\" only by retaking the course the next time it is offered by the Acupuncture Institute. Successful completion of a program of aca- demic remediation requires a student to pass each repeated course with a \"C\" or better and have earned a cumulative GPA (CGPA) of 2.75 or better. A student who has not earned a CGPA of 2.75 or better upon one semester of remediation but has shown substantial improvement in his or her course work will be allowed one more semester of remediation in order to achieve the CGPA of 2.75. A student in a program of academic remediation may ask the Director for a written definition of a minimum CGPA, or range of CGPA, which would be deemed to be substantial improvement, and for a written calculation of the semester of remediation GPA which would be necessary to achieve in order to bring the student's CGPA into the range of substantial improvement. In such event the student shall countersign the written statement and deliver a copy of the signed document to the Director. A student may not graduate with a grade of \"D\" on their transcript. Grades of \"D\" may not remain on the student's transcript for more than one year and must be remediated by re-peating the course and receiving a grade of \"C\" or better. This is not a limitation for the instructor, but rather a requirement to pass each course so that students have the appro- priate level of proficiency to pass the NCCTCM Board Exams and become licensed acupunc-turists. A student may remediate a grade only by retaking the course before graduation. If the student does not pass the course with a \"C\" or better, the student will be on Academic Probation and will be required to speak with the Director of the Acupuncture Institute be-fore registering for any new classes.AcADEmIc DISmISSAl A student who after one semester of remedia-tion does not show substantial improvement in his or her academic performance or after two semesters of academic remediation does not achieve a CGPA of 2.75 will be academically dismissed from the acupuncture program. Academic dismissal may also occur if a stu- dent's CGPA falls below 2.50, or if the student receives one \"F' or two grades of \"D\" in one semester on a second occasion. Upon com-pletion of the first semester, any student not achieving at least a 2.50 GPA will be academi- cally dismissed from the program. DISmISSAl FR om ThE AcUpUncTURE InSTITUTE Academic inadequacies are not the only rea-son for dismissal from the Master of Science in Acupuncture degree program. The following is a list of additional causes for dismissal: 1. Failure to meet generally accepted stan-dards of ethical and professional conduct and clinical practice. Such dismissal is subject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration as es-tablished by the Director of the UBAI. 2. Pleading \"Guilty\" or \"No Contest\", or be-ing found guilty of any crime involving moral turpitude; in the event of a pre- existing or new felony the Institute shall have the right to impose sanctions, in-cluding but not limited to dismissal, on a case by case basis. 3. Repeated violation of public policy, or demonstration of behavior that creates safety hazards and/or disrupts the order of the institution. Dismissal of this nature is subject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration as es- tablished by the Director of the Institute. 4. Failure to meet financial obligations or commitments to the University of Bridge-port Acupuncture Institute. The Institute shall have the right to suspend any student from any or all privileges of a stu-dent in good standing during the pendency of any proceeding pursuant to the foregoing until such time as all University procedures are terminated. WIThDRAWAl FR om ThE pRoGRAmIf a student withdraws or wishes to take a leave of absence from the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute and is in good standing he or she is eligible for readmission. A student who withdraws when not in good academic standing or, who leaves without officially withdrawing seriously jeopardizes his or her chances of future readmission or admission to other acupuncture Institutes. If a student withdraws or takes a leave of ab- sence with plans to reenter at a later date, he or she should make this clear at the time of withdrawal. Please note: All requirements for the master's degree in Acupuncture (MS-AC) must be completed within five (5) years from the first matriculation to graduation. All requirements for the master's degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine (MS-TCM) must be completed within seven (7) calendar years from the first matricu-lation to graduation. If a student withdraws one or more times from the program, the cu- mulative absences must not exceed two years. Former University of Bridgeport Naturopathic and Chiropractic students who started acu- puncture training as a combined-degree stu-dent during their professional training who then took a leave of absence or withdrew from the acupuncture institute must demon-strate competency through examination for all work completed prior to withdrawal from the program, with the exception of the basic sci-ence (\"AWB\"-designated) courses, upon read- mission to the program. All such previously completed coursework will then be treated as transfer credit and the time frame for comple- tion of the MS-Acup degree will be 4 years (48 months) from the date of re-entry into the UBAI program; and the time frame for com- pletion of the MS-TCM degree will be 5 years (60 months) from the date of re-entry into the UBAI program. If a student wishes to withdraw or take a leave of absence from the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute, he or she must submit a letter to the Director stating the reason for withdrawal. The student must also complete all required paperwork from the Registrar's of- fice. In addition, the student should also note if he/she plans to re-enter the program and the term (Fall/Spring year) of such re-matric- ulation. READmISSIon T o ThE pRoGRAm To be considered for readmission to the pro-Acupuncture Institute69gram after withdrawal or leave of absence, write to the Assistant Director of the Institute requesting readmission and indicate the date of re-entry desired. It is important to do this well in advance of the proposed date of read- mission.

Transfer Credit Policy Students may apply to have some of the train-ing required by the Acupuncture Institute for graduation transferred from another acupunc- ture degree-granting program, or an accred-ited school of post-graduate medical training. Transfer credit will be assessed by the Insti- tute Director and is only awarded for courses similar in content and length, and with instruc- tors similarly qualified as those given by the Acupuncture Institute. Students requesting transfer credit must provide an official course transcript, a school catalog and, if requested, a course syllabus for any course for which trans-fer credit is requested. Documentation of the transfer of credit awarded, and the institution from which transfer credit was awarded are kept in the student files. No less than 20 clini- cal credits and 14 didactic class credits must be completed at the Acupuncture Institute for the student to be eligible for graduation and the granting of the MS-Acupuncture and MS-Tradi- tional Chinese Medicine degrees. All students, including transfer students, must complete the Clinical Entrance Exam with a score of no less than 75%, the Clinical Exit Exam and all practi- cal clinical examinations with a grade of 70% or better to be eligible for graduation. An applicant's credits from another Institute may be considered for transfer only under the following conditions: 1. The applicant must meet current prereq- uisites in force at the University of Bridge- port Acupuncture Institute at the time the student originally enrolled at the health profession institution from which the transfer is being made, regardless of hav- ing been accepted to the institution from which they are transferring. In many cas- es, University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute's requirements are higher than those for other acupuncture related pro- fessional schools. 2. Be courses for a student majoring in the medical sciences, acupuncture or TCM medicine 3. The institution from which the student is transferring must be acceptable to the Admissions Committee of the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute, such as another acupuncture degree-granting program, or an accredited school of post- graduate medical training. 4. The credits being transferred must be equivalent in credit hours content and quality to that of the University of Bridge- port Acupuncture Institute. If the Univer - sity of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute course contains a laboratory so must the course being considered for transfer. In order to verify equivalence, students may be required to provide a course descrip- tion or course syllabus for comparison. 5. Only credits with a grade of \"C\" (2.00 on a 4.00 scale) or better are considered for transfer. Transfer credit is credit only; the transferred grade will not affect the QPR. 6. In order to obtain transfer credit the stu- dent must have graduated or have been granted an honorable withdrawal from the professional or graduate school at- tended. 7. To receive transfer credit for any courses taken 3 or more years prior to entering the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute, and for any course completed during an apprenticeship or other non- traditional or non-accredited learning en- vironment, the student must demonstrate competency through examination. The passing grade for such exams is 75%. 8. Credits used to satisfy the minimum pre- requisites for admission must not be used for advanced placement credit. 9. All international transcripts and course descriptions must be evaluated by an ap- proved foreign credential evaluation ser - vice. Advanced Standing Students who are accepted as transfer students may receive advanced standing if a substantial number of semester hours have been accepted by University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Insti-tute. This may enable the student to complete either the MS-ACUP program in less than six semesters, or the MS-TCM degree in less than eight semesters. Transfer credit may be grant- ed either with or without advanced standing. If advanced standing is granted: No more than 84 credits may transfer from another institution of acupuncture or TCM medicine for the MS-ACUP degree. No more than 110 credits may transfer from another in- stitution of acupuncture or TCM medicine for the MS-TCM degree. No less than 20 clinical credits and 14 didactic class credits must be completed at the Acupuncture Institute for a student to be eligible for graduation and the granting of the MS-Acupuncture or MS-Tradi- tional Chinese Medicine degree. All students, including transfer students, must complete the Clinical Entrance Exam with a score of no less than 75%, the Clinical Exit Exam and all practi-cal clinical examinations with a grade of 70% or better to be eligible for graduation. Advanced standing in the Acupuncture Insti- tute requires evaluation of official transcripts and course descriptions from the institution of higher learning where the student received his or her training as described in Transfer Credit above. Foreign students must have their transcripts evaluated by a foreign transcript evaluating services, such as World Educational Services (WES). A special curriculum sched-ule will be made up for the student based on semester hours transferred and course avail- ability. Tuition will be calculated based on the num- ber of credits being taken per semester mul- tiplied by the single credit fee at the time of the student's attendance. If the total number of credits exceeds 13 in any one semester, the student will be responsible for paying the full time tuition rate. If advanced standing is not granted, but some semester hours are transferable, the student will be admitted to the first semester and will be exempt from courses for which transfer credit was granted. Former University of Bridgeport students in the other graduate-level health sciences pro- grams who started acupuncture training as a combined-degree student during their profes- sional training who then took a leave-of ab- sence or withdrew from the Acupuncture In-stitute must demonstrate competency through examination for all work completed prior to withdrawal from the program, with the excep-tion of the basic science (\"AWB\"-designated) courses, upon readmission to the program. All such previously completed coursework will then be treated as transfer credit and the time frame for completion of the MS- Acupuncture degree program will be four (4) years (48 months) from the date of re-entry into the UBAI program; and the time frame Acupuncture Institute71for completion of the MS-Traditional Chinese Medicine degree program will be five (5) years (60 months) from the date of re-entry into the UBAI program Evaluation of advanced standing is completed by the Director of the Acupuncture Institute. Upon request, a letter is sent to the student, with a copy available in the student file, of all coursework which is acceptable for trans- fer credit. The transfer credit grades will not appear on official transcripts from the Univer - sity of Bridgeport and the grades from those classes will not affect a student's GPA. Course prerequisites must be completed by all students, including those taking courses as auditors, before admission to a course will be granted. Exceptions may be made by permis- sion of the Director under the following spe-cial circumstances: 1. A student has skills equivalent to com-pletion of the pre-requisites from non- traditional training or experience (i.e.: in an apprenticeship). Students may re-quest a waiver from completing the pre- requisites before taking more advanced courses. Students will have to complete all such courses or demonstrate compe- tency through examination before gradu- ation from the Acupuncture Institute. 2. A University of Bridgeport Health Scienc- es graduate student requires special skills for an outreach clinic setting (e.g.: clean needle technique and auricular acupunc- ture for NADA-style detox treatments). Transfer of credit for Foreign health profession Institutions To be eligible for transfer of credits, applicants from foreign acupuncture, medical, chiroprac- tic, osteopathic or dental institutions located in countries that do not have an accredita-tion system equivalent to those of the United States, must submit evidence of proficiency in all work submitted for advance standing cred-it. Credits from foreign Institutes and universi- ties must have transcript evaluation performed by a reputable transcript evaluation service. To receive advanced-standing for courses taken 3 or more years prior to entering the University of Bridgeport Acupuncture Institute, and for any course completed during an ap- prenticeship or other non-traditional or non- accredited learning environment, the student must demonstrate competency through exami- nation. The passing grade for such exams is 75%.Acupuncture Institute72College of Chiropractic Interim Dean: Paul Sherman Elenore Dana Hall 30 Hazel Street Telephone: 576-4278 Fax: (203) 576-4483 E-mail: psherman@bridgeport.edu Coordinator, Academic Affairs: Paul Chiropractic Building 75 Linden Avenue Telephone: (203) 576-4279 Fax: (203) 576-4351 Associate Dean, Clinic: Anthony Onorato Health Sciences Building 60 Street Telephone: Chiropractic is the philosophy, art, and sci- ence which concerns itself with the relation- ship between structure and function of the human body, as that relationship may affect the restoration and preservation of health.

Curriculum A Doctor of Chiropractic is a physician whose purpose is to meet the health needs of the public as a member of the healing arts. He/she gives particular attention to the relationship of structural and neurological aspects of the body and is educated in the basic and clinical sciences as well as in relat- ed health subjects. Chiropractic science con- cerns itself with the relationship between structure (primarily the spine), and function (primarily coordinated by the nervous sys- tem) of the human body as that relationship may affect the restoration and preservation of health.. \"The DCP of the University of Bridgeport incorporates the understanding of chiro- practic as a profession practicing primary health care, provides curricular and clinical evidence of that through outcome measures, and consists of education and training to prepare graduates to: A. Practice direct contact health care as a portal-of-entry provider for patients of all ages and genders; B. Assess the patient's general health sta- tus, complaints and problems leading to a diagnosis. Specific elements of patient assessment minimally include complete health history; review of systems; physi- cal, biomechanical and neurological ex- amination; the analysis of vertebral and extra-vertebral subluxation; and, when clinically indicated, diagnostic imaging, clinical laboratory, and/or specialized di-agnostic procedures; C. Develop a goal-oriented case manage-ment plan that addresses any sublux-ations or other neurobiomechanical problems, and that may include rehabili- tation and/or other therapeutic modali-ties; D. Develop appropriate doctor/patient re-lationships with continuity in the chiro-practic management of health problems, and coordination of care with other health-care providers; and E. Promote wellness by assessing health risk and providing problem-related, gen- eral and public health information, and lifestyle counseling. The purpose of chiropractic professional ed-ucation is to provide the student with a core of knowledge in the basic and clinical sci- ences and related health subjects sufficient 73to perform the professional obligations of a doctor of chiropractic. A doctor of chiropractic is a primary care physician whose purpose as a practitioner of the healing arts, is to help meet the health needs of individual patients and of the pub-lic, giving particular attention to the struc- tural and neurological aspects of the body. The application of science in chiropractic concerns itself with the relationship between structure, primarily the spine, and function, primarily coordinated by the nervous sys- tem of the human body, as that relationship may affect the restoration and preservation of health. Further, this application of science in chi- ropractic focuses on the inherent ability of the body to heal without the use of drugs or surgery. As a gatekeeper for direct access to the health delivery system, the doctor of chi-ropractic's responsibilities as a primary care physician include wellness promotion, health promotion, health assessment, diag-nosis and the chiropractic management of the patient's health care needs. When in- dicated, the doctor of chiropractic consults with, co-manages, or refers to other health care providers.\" ( From the Council on Chi- ropractic Education Standards for Doctor of Chiropractic Programs, January 2007) It is the purpose of the University of Bridge- port College of Chiropractic program to of- fer as a minimum those courses and objec-tives as suggested in the CCE standards. It is also the purpose of the UBCC program to offer a broad-based educational experience. In many cases, the educational program pre- sented will go beyond the course offerings suggested by CCE and will also go beyond individual state laws and scope of practice. The University of Bridgeport College of Chi- ropractic curriculum is divided into three phases: Basic Sciences, Clinical Sciences, and Clinical Services. basic Sciences The basic Science curriculum instructs stu- dents in Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Public Health, and Pathology. These courses are offered primarily during the first two years of a student's education. It is the purpose of this aspect of the pro-gram for students to develop an understand-ing of both normal and abnormal structure and function, homeostatic mechanisms, and to gain a foundation upon which the clinical sciences will be built. clinical Sciences Students from their first semester onward are instructed in the Clinical Sciences. Course offerings include: Chiropractic History, Chi- ropractic Principles and Practice, Diagnosis, Radiology, Technique Procedures, Nutrition, and Physiological Therapeutics and Reha- bilitation Procedures. Students are given in-depth training in the diagnosis and treat- ment of patients. Practical hands-on training is included beginning in Semester I and con-tinuing to graduation. Information from the basic science curriculum is integrated into the clinical science course offerings and is a foundation upon which the clinical science courses build. Many of the clinical science courses have as a prerequisite successful completion of the basic science courses. clinical Services The Clinical Services phase of the curricu-lum is the last and most important aspect of the UBCC program. Interns at the Col- lege's Chiropractic Health Center care for patients under the supervision and direction of licensed doctors of chiropractic. To be eligible for this part of the curriculum, stu-dents must be in good academic standing, successfully completed all courses in Semes- ters I thru V, and successfully completed the clinic services entrance examination. During the Clinical Services portion of the program students will continue to receive training in the clinical sciences. They will also continue to be evaluated during their internship in or - der to remain eligible for clinical services. To continue in Clinical Services, students must remain in good academic standing. Towards the completion of the Clinical Services pro-gram students will be administered a clini- cal competency examination which must be successfully completed prior to graduation. Because each course is integrated with other course offerings, students should be aware of the prerequisite and corequisite require-ments. Throughout the curriculum every effort is made to insure the relevance of information to chiropractic principles and practice. The following is a breakdown, by subject, of the time devoted to each area of study within the curriculum. Licensure Requirements and Career Opportunities lIcEnSURE REQUIREmEnTS The Doctor of Chiropractic degree program offered by the University of Bridgeport Col- lege of Chiropractic is accredited by the Council on Chiropractic Education. As in-dicated in a previous section, the college meets or exceeds the minimum educational requirements suggested by the CCE. Students who receive the Doctor of Chiropractic de-gree from UBCC are eligible for licensure in all states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the Canadian Provinces and other foreign coun-tries as regulated by local laws and regula- tions without restrictions. Licensure in many states require students to complete Parts I, II, III, and Physiotherapy examination as of- fered by the National Board of Chiroprac- tic Examiners (NBCE). Additionally, states also require that students pass the Part IV Practical Examination offered by the NBCE. Students should contact the NBCE or the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards (FCLB) for additional information pertain- ing to licensure where they wish to practice. The College maintains a directory published by FCLB in the library as well as within vari- ous offices located in the College of Chiro-practic. The directory contains information pertaining to licensure and to scope of prac- tice within each state. cAREER oppoRTUnITIES Approximately ninety (90%) percent of the students who have entered the UBCC have completed the requirements for graduation as outlined in this catalog. Most graduates of UBCC go directly into a private practice of their own. Other graduates work as an as- sociate with an experienced doctor or they may rent space within an existing practice. complAInT pR ocEDURES Any complaint regarding the Doctor of Chi-ropractic Program and its compliance with the CCE Standards may be addressed to the College of Chiropractic74following: The Council on Chiropractic Education 8049 N. 85th Website: Curriculum (18 WEEK PROGRAM PER SEMESTER) NUMBER COURSE LECT.

The third digit indicates the sequence within that discipline. e.g. AN 511 AN - Anatomy 5- year one 1- semester one 1 - first course in discipline sequence Grades earned by students are submitted to the Registrar utilizing the following designa- tions. Grades earned are on a four (4) point scale with an \"A\" or 4 quality points be- ing the highest grade attained. Grades with quality points are: GRADE QUAlITY poInTS A 4.0 C 2.0 B+ 3.5 D 0.0 B 3.0 F 0.0 C+ 2.5 The cumulative quality point ratio (QPR) is determined by dividing the number of semester hours into the number of points earned. A grade of \"D\" is not an acceptable passing grade. Transfer credits are not in- cluded in this computation. In addition to the Academic Grades submit- ted by faculty, the following Administrative Grades are also utilized. Administrative Grades I The grade of Incomplete \"I\", is used by the faculty to indicate that a stu- dent has not completed all course re- quirements. A student will have one week from the last day of the term to meet with the faculty and complete all course requirements. Upon comple-tion of the course requirements the faculty will submit the earned grade. Failure by the student to meet with the faculty and complete the require- ments in one week from the last day of the term will result in the grade of \"I\" being converted to a grade of \"F.\" Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will be required to register and retake that course in it's entirety when the course is regularly scheduled. Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will not be eligible to register for courses for which that course is a prerequi-site. R Students may repeat a course at any grade level below \"A\". The first repeat will replace the first-time grade for the computation of the QPR. TCR This indicates transfer credit granted for equivalent work completed at an- other accredited institution. W Withdrawal grades are assigned based on the following policy statements: 1. If the student officially withdraws from a course during the official change-of-registration period, that course does not appear on the student's transcript. 2. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the end of the change-of-reg- istration period, but before the end of the official withdrawal period, a grade of \"W\" is assigned and that course remains on the student's transcript. Courses with a grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR and do not count toward \"hours attempted.\" 3. The names of students who have official-ly withdrawn from a course and receive the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the balance of the semester. 4. Any exceptions to the above, including late withdrawals, must be approved by the Dean and the Provost before they be-come official and are recorded. Poor aca- demic performance does not constitute a valid reason for late withdrawal. Academic policies used to manage and di-rect the academic program are: 1. Attendance Requirements 2. Requirements for Graduation 3. Good Academic Standing 4. Academic Warning, Probation and Dismissal 5. Dismissal from the College (Non-Academic) 6. Withdrawal from the Program 7. Readmission to the Program Attendance Requirements Each student is expected to attend all lec- tures and laboratories and other activities as-sociated with the total completion of a given course. A student who is absent from class in excess of ten percent of the total class hours may have his or her grade reduced for lack of participation as outlined in the course syl- labus. A student absent in excess of twenty present of the total class hours will receive a grade of \"F.\" Requirements for Graduation In order to be eligible for graduation from the College, candidates must meet the fol- lowing criteria: 1. Have successfully completed a minimum of four academic years of resident study in an accredited institution granting a first professional degree. The last 3 semesters must have been in residence at the Uni- versity of Bridgeport College of Chiro- practic. A student must complete at least 25% of the program to qualify for a UBCC degree and have completed all require- ments within 7 years of matriculations. 2. Have successfully completed all require- ments of the educational program and have achieved a 2.50 cumulative grade point average. 3. Have successfully passed parts I and II of the National Board of Chiropractic Exam- iners. 4. Have been recommended for graduation by the College Faculty and Administra- tion. 5. Have satisfactorily met all financial obli-gations to the College, Office of Financial Aid, publication of the class yearbook and commencement exercises. Satisfactory Academic Progress Students enrolled in the UBCC Doctor of Chiropractic degree program are in good ac- ademic standing and are making satisfactory academic progress, if they have success-fully achieved the following criteria upon completion of their most recent semester of course work: 1. Did not receive a grade of \"F or D\" in any course, and 2. Maintain a cumulative grade point aver - age of 2.50 or better.College of Chiropractic77A student who has not achieved the above criteria is not making satisfactory academic progress and will be required to follow the criteria as outlined in the catalog regarding Academic Probation and Dismissal. Good Academic Standing Good academic standing is achieved when a student is maintaining good grades, has met all financial responsibilities to the College and is not guilty of any breach of the stan-dards governing ethical and clinical conduct. AcADEmIc WARnInG, pRobATIon AnD DISmISSAl Safeguards have been built into the system to protect students who are not performing well academically from suffering academic failure. During the semester, the faculty re-ports to the Dean on a regular basis, con- cerning the grades of all students in their courses. If it is noted that particular students are doing poorly, these students will be con- tacted to set up an interview. The interview will consist of a discussion of the causes for the student's poor performance and ways in which he or she might improve a grade. AcADEmIc WARnInG Academic warning will result when the fol- lowing is taking place: 1. The most recent semester quality point ratio falls below a 2.00. AcADEmIc pR obATIon Academic Probation occurs when the stu- dent's QPR falls below 2.50 or if a student receives a grade of \"F or D\" in one or more courses. A student on academic probation is not eligible to carry a full academic course load. AcADEmIc REmEDIATIon A student on academic probation will be placed in a program of Academic Remedia- tion. The student is required to meet with the Associate Dean of the College to deter - mine what courses will be retaken to satisfy the requirements of Remediation. In general, academic Remediation requires a student to repeat all grades of \"F or D\", carry a reduced academic load.AcADEmIc DISmISSAl A student who does not show substantial academic improvement after one semester of Remediation, or who is unable to achieve a QPR of 2.50 after two semester of Reme-diation will be dismissed from the College of Chiropractic. Academic dismissal may also occur if a stu- dent's QPR falls below a 2.50 on a second occasion. Any student not achieving a QPR of at least 1.75 upon completion of the first semester of study will be academically dismissed from the College of Chiropractic. DISmISSAl FR om ThE collEGE Academic inadequacies are not the only rea-sons for dismissal from the College or Uni- versity. The following is a list of additional causes for dismissal: 1. Failure to meet the generally accepted standards of ethical conduct and clinical practice. Dismissal of this nature is sub-ject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration. 2. Pleading guilty or \"nolo contende,\" or being found guilty of any crime involv-ing moral turpitude or being felonious in nature. 3. Repeated violation of public policy, or the demonstration of behavior that creates safety hazards and/or disrupts the order of the institution. Dismissal of this nature is subject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration. 4. Failure to meet financial obligations or commitments to the College or Univer - sity. WIThDRAWAl FR om ThE pR oGRAm If a student withdraws from University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic in good standing he or she is eligible for readmis- sion. A student who withdraws when not in good academic standing or, who leaves without officially withdrawing, seriously jeopardizes his or her chances of future re- admission. If a student withdraws with plans to re-enter at a later date, he or she should make this clear at the time of withdrawal.All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within seven years from the first matriculation to graduation. If a stu- dent withdraws one or more times from the program, the cumulative absences must not exceed three and one half years. READmISSIon T o ThE pRoGRAm To be readmitted to the program after with- drawal, a student must write to the Associ- ate Dean for Academic Affairs requesting re- admission and indicate the date of re-entry desired. It is important to do this well in advance of such a date. Minimum Requirements for Admission The University of Bridgeport College of Chi- ropractic does not discriminate on the basis of sex, age, color, creed, ethnic origin or handicap in the administration of its educa-tion programs or on admissions. All candidates for admission must furnish proof of having acquired three years (90 ac- ceptable semester hours or more) of study, creditable towards a baccalaureate degree, taken in accredited, degree-granting institu- tions. Pre-professional education acquired must have been completed with a minimum cumulative Quality Point Ratio of 2.50 on a 4.00 scale. A baccalaureate degree is recom-mended. All candidates must have completed the fol- lowing specific courses as part of their pre-professional preparation: Communication/Language Skills 6 Semester Hours Psychology 3 Semester Hours Chemistry: General and Organic (w/ Lab) 12 Semester Hours General: 3 semester hours minimum Organic: 9 semester hours minimum Electives (Social Sciences/Humanities) 15 Semester Hours General Bio/Anat & Phys (w/ Lab) 8 Semester Hours (2 consecutive courses) General Physics (w/ Lab) and related Studies 8 Semester HoursCollege of Chiropractic78All bio/anat & phys, chemistry and physics courses must: Be courses suitable for students majoring in sciences.

Cumulative science quality point ratio must be 2.25 or better. Have a related laboratory. For Admission beginning with the fall 2003, all matriculants must furnish proof of having earned a minimum of 30 semester hours in upper division credits. A personal interview is required. Under ex- tenuating circumstances a telephone inter - view will be granted. Applicants must understand that possession of minimum entrance requirements does not constitute a guarantee of acceptance. Each entering class is selected from a large pool of eligible candidates, a majority of whom have completed four-year degrees. Those students selected for acceptance usually have obtained grades which are substantial-ly higher than the minimum requirement. Physical Qualifications for Admissions The following physical qualifications are re- quired for participation in the doctoral de- gree program at the UB College of Chiroprac- tic. These qualifications are essential for the preparation of the Doctor of Chiropractic. Stu- dents at the College must be able to perform at a high level of competency in all phases of classroom, clinic, and laboratory activities as they will ultimately use the knowledge at- tained as Doctors of Chiropractic. The qualifications are as follows: 1. The student must possess the coordina- tion and use of both upper limbs as their use is required for, among other skills, the performance of the chiropractic ad- justment, the primary skill of a practicing Doctor of Chiropractic. 2. The student must possess manual dex- terity so that he/she may perform in the various clinical, chiropractic, and basic science laboratories without posing a threat to him/herself, patients, or his/her fellow students' safety and well-being. 3. The student must have the ability to stand not only in the performance of manipu- lative procedures but others as well. 4. The student must have hearing and visual senses, appropriately assisted if needed, acute enough to individually record pa- tient histories, to provide routine safety in- structions, and perform stethoscopic and other ausucultatory examinations, to read all forms of diagnostic imaging, and to perform microscopy examinations so that he/she can adequately interpret normal, abnormal, and pathological changes. Handicapped persons will not be summarily denied admission, nor will higher scholastic requirements be demanded of them. They, like all other students, must carry out class- room, laboratory, and clinical assignments, including microscopic work, x-ray interpreta- tion and techniques, or the equivalent; pass written, oral, and practical examinations and meet all the requirements of the College. Cancellation of Admission or Registration The college reserves the right to cancel the admission or registration of individu- als whose attendance at the college, in the opinion of the appropriate administrative of-ficers and dean, is not mutually beneficial to that person and to the institution. Individuals who have registered at other ed- ucational institutions may not disregard such records and make application on the basis of high school and selected college transcripts. Applicants who gain admission to the college on the basis of incomplete or fraudulent cre- dentials or misrepresentations in their written application for admission may have their: admission and registration canceled with- out refund of any fees; and total credits rescinded that have been earned following such admissions;and future registration at the college prohib- ited. Pre-Professional Requirements for Licensure It is most important that all candidates for admission thoroughly investigate the specif-ic requirements of each state in which they plan to practice. In some cases, pre-pro- fessional requirements must be completed prior to entrance into a chiropractic program in order to be qualified to apply for a state licensing examination. International Applicants International Applicants must complete an Application for International Students as well as an Application to the College of Chi- ropractic. Applicants who have done pre-professional study in foreign countries must submit of- ficial copies of the records of such study as well as translations if the original records are not in English. Usually, these records must be evaluated by an appropriate professional agency. Any fees charged by such an agen-cy are the responsibility of the student. Fol- lowing submission of these documents to UBCC, the Director of Admissions will make contact with the prospective student. If the applicant is a native of a foreign country, he or she must demonstrate profi-ciency in English at a level appropriate for advanced study. At a minimum proficiency can be demonstrated in one of the ways listed below: 1. A score of 550 or better on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) AND a score of 50 or better on the Test of Spoken English(TSE). Information on the TOEFL/TSE can be obtained from TOEFL, P.O. Box 6151, Princeton, NJ 08541-6151, USA or; 2. Receipt of a grade \"C\" or better in one semester of English at an accredited U.S. college or university or; 3. A letter showing successful completion of the University of Bridgeport's English Language Institute. Application Procedures Application for admission must include: 1. A properly completed Application for Admission form. 2. Application Fee. The applicant must provide the following to the Director of Admissions: College of Chiropractic791. Official transcripts of all college records. 2. Three letters of recommendation, one must be from a health care professional. Selection of Candidates The University of Bridgeport College of Chi-ropractic is coeducational and does not dis- criminate against any applicant on the basis of sex, race, creed, color or national origin. (Title VI, Civil Rights Act 1964) All eligible finalists are invited for a personal interview before any action is taken upon their application. Among the qualities typical of most success- ful candidates for admission, the following are especially important: 1. Superior communication skills, both oral and written. 2. Evidence of strong motivation to becom-ing a helping professional and, more specifically, a chiropractor. 3. Initiative and honesty as evidenced in the candidates' transactions within the application process and in all informa- tion submitted in support of the applica- tion. 4.

Application Deadlines Applications for admission may be submit-ted at any time. noTIFIcATIon oF A ccEpTAncE Applicants will be notified in writing of the decision of the Admissions Committee as soon as a decision is made. Transfer Students Transfer credit The University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic may grant transfer credit for courses taken in accredited professional and graduate schools. In doing so, the following requirements must be met:1. The courses taken must have content equivalent to courses given at UBCC. lf the UBCC course contains a laboratory, so must the course being considered for transfer. 2. A course being considered for transfer must have credits and hours equivalent to or greater than the same course at UBCC. 3. Any course to be transferred must have been passed with a grade of C or better. (2.0 on a 4.00 scale.) 4. A transferred course carries credit equal to the UBCC course for which credit is granted. The original grade earned is not transferred and does not affect the stu- dent's QPR at UBCC. 5. In order to obtain transfer credit the stu- dent must have been granted an honor - able withdrawal from the professional or graduate school attended. An overall Grade Point Average (GPA) of a 2.50 (on a 4.0 scale) or higher must be achieved in order to be considered for transfer sta-tus or advanced standing. It is important to note that all transfer stu-dents must meet the entry level prerequi-site requirements for first semester students regardless of having been accepted to the institution from which they are transferring. In many cases, UBCC's requirements are higher than those for other chiropractic and professional schools. Prospective transfer students should note that an admissions application to UBCC is needed in order to begin a review for trans-fer credit. Students wishing to transfer must provide the Admissions Committee with an official transcript and a catalog from the chi-ropractic, professional or graduate school/s from which they are transferring, as well as a syllabus from each course for which the student is requesting transfer credit. Advanced Standing Students who are accepted as transfer stu-dents may receive advanced standing if a substantial number of semester hours have been accepted by UBCC. This could possi-bly enable the student to complete the D.C. program in less than 8 semesters. Transfer credit may be granted either with or without College of Chiropractic advanced standing, Effective Fall 2005, The University of Bridgeport College of Chiro- practic will grant no more than a maximum of 20% of advanced standing credit/hours towards our curriculum. A transfer student is eligible to receive no more than 42 transfer credits. Potential transfer students should be aware that in most cases they would have to complete approximately, 3 to 3 1/2 years at UBCC if accepted. If advanced standing is granted: 1. A special curriculum schedule will be made up for the student based on semes-ter hours transferred and course avail- ability. 2. Tuition will be calculated based on the number of credits being taken per se-mester multiplied by the single credit fee (if less than 14 credits per semester) at the time of the student's attendance. If advanced standing is not granted, but some semester hours are transferable, the student will be admitted to the first semester and will be exempt from courses for which transfer credit was granted.80College of Naturopathic Medicine Dean: Marcia Prenguber, N.D., FABNO Health Sciences Center 60 Telephone: (203) 576-4110 Fax: (203) 576-4107 E-mail: mprengub@bridgeport.edu Associate Academic Affairs: Health Sciences Center Telephone: (203) 576-4119 Associate Dean for Clinical Education: Cheryl Proctor, N.D.

Norton, A. Ross, D. Terfera, E. Zampieron Naturopathic medicine is a distinct profession of primary health care that emphasizes pre- vention and treatment of disease, and promo- tion of optimal health and wellness through the use of natural therapies that enhance the inherent healing wisdom of nature, the vis medicatrix naturae. Rooted in tradition, na-turopathic physicians utilize clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathy, physical medicine, and other natural modalities to help patients thrive. Most naturopathic physicians are in private practice, though opportunities in group and integrative practice settings, re-search, and education are rapidly growing. The University of Bridgeport, College of Natu- ropathic Medicine (UBNMC) trains students to a broad scope of practice, to prepare students to practice across North America. Students are responsible for being informed of licensure requirements and scope of practice in the le-gal jurisdiction in which they plan to practice. Degree Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (N.D.) Recognition and Memberships UBCNM is approved to offer the degree of Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine by the Con- necticut State Office of Higher Education. The College of Naturopathic Medicine pro-gram is accredited by the Council on Natu- ropathic Medical Education (CNME). Their contact information is - sity of Bridgeport is accredited by the Council on Institutions of Higher Education (CIHE) of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC). UBCNM is an institutional member of the Association of Accredited Na- turopathic Medical Colleges (AANMC). College of Naturopathic Medicine Mission Statement The Mission of UBCNM is to prepare individ- uals to become physicians who are leaders in patient-centered, collaborative, and sustain- able healthcare settings and are guided by a commitment to the philosophy, principles and traditions of naturopathic healing and medicine. Program Competencies Prior to graduation from the College of Na-turopathic Medicine students are required to meet the standards of knowledge, behaviors and practices associated with competency de-velopment in naturopathic medicine. These competencies have been established to con- firm that graduates from the UBCNM possess the knowledge, values, technical ability, clini- cal reasoning and communication skills need- ed to practice medicine safely and effectively. Additionally, it is expected that as medical professionals our graduates will integrate re- flection, research and professional develop-ment into their medical practices. Competen- cies include: 1. Patient Care Gather complete, relevant patient in- formation Document encounters including re- porting of information and develop- ment of an assessment and plan effi- ciently and accurately. Apply clinical reasoning to patient management Utilize principles of Naturopathic Med- icine in assessment and treatment Adhere to the therapeutic order in the context of patient management Apply universal precautions accurately and effectively 2. Communication Maintain cultural awareness and sensi- tivity Articulate clearly and responsibly in verbal, non-verbal and written forms Employ active listening Choose effective communication tools and techniques including communica- tion technologies to facilitate discus- sion and enhanced team function 3.

Values Display a commitment to naturopathic principles and philosophy Demonstrate reflective practice that in- corporates self-care Respond to needs of patients and soci- ety while Naturopathic Principles and Practice The American Association of Naturopathic Physicians has adopted the following official definition of Naturopathic Medicine, its prin- ciples and practice: Naturopathic medicine is a distinct system of primary healthcare \u2014 an art, science, philoso-phy and practice of diagnosis, treatment and prevention of illness. Naturopathic medicine is distinguished by the principles upon which its practice is based. The principles are con- tinually reexamined in the light of scientific advances. The techniques of naturopathic medicine include modern and traditional, sci- entific and empirical methods. The following principles are the foundation of naturopathic medical practice: The Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae): Naturopathic medicine recognizes an inherent self-healing process in the per - son which is ordered and intelligent. Naturo-pathic physicians act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to fa- cilitate and augment this inherent self-healing process. Identify and Treat the Causes (Tolle Causam): The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness, rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. First Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere): Na- turopathic physicians follow three guidelines to avoid harming a patient: Utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat; Avoid when possible the harmful sup- pression of symptoms; Acknowledge, respect and work with the individual's self-healing process. Doctor As Teacher (Docere): Naturopathic physicians educate their patients and em- power them to take responsibility for their health. They also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient re- lationship. Treat the Whole Person: Naturopathic phy- sicians treat each patient by taking into ac- count individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other fac- tors. Since total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Prevention: Naturopathic physicians empha- size the prevention of disease \u2014 assessing risk factors, heredity and susceptibility to dis- ease and making appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness. Naturopathic medicine is committed to the creation of a healthy world in which humanity may thrive. pRAcTIcE Naturopathic Methods: Naturopathic medi-cine is defined by its principles. Diagnostic methods, treatments and modalities are se- lected and applied based upon these prin-ciples in relationship to the unique individual needs of each patient. Naturopathic Practice: Naturopathic practice includes the following diagnostic and thera- peutic modalities: clinical nutrition; botani- cal medicine; naturopathic physical medicine including naturopathic manipulative therapy; public health measures and hygiene; health counseling; minor surgery; homeopathy; acupuncture; naturopathic obstetrics (natural childbirth); and laboratory assessment, diag- nostic imaging, and clinical diagnosis. Curriculum The academic and clinical curriculum at UBC-NM is an intensive four-year, full-time, that provides students with a foundation in the knowledge and skills essential to the practice of naturopathic medicine. This doctoral de- gree prepares students for the Naturopathic Physicians Licensing Exam (NPLEX), required for state and provincial licensing exams, and for the general practice of naturopathic medi- cine. The curriculum, instruction and clinical ex- periences are designed to prepare graduates to be competent physicians offering com- prehensive healthcare, using traditional and up-to-date methods and modalities in accor - dance with the principles of Naturopathic Medicine. The first year of the program is de- voted to biomedical sciences and naturopath-ic philosophy. The second year of training is focused on clinical sciences and the begin-ning of coursework in therapeutic modalities. The last two years focus on naturopathic case management related to organ systems, special populations (e.g., pediatrics and geriatrics), in addition to advanced study of therapeutic modalities. Clinical training begins during the second year of study, through observation of patient care. During the 3rd year of training, students provide a supportive role in patient care at the on-campus UB Clinics and off-site com- munity clinics in the surrounding area, under the supervision and direction of naturopathic physicians and other licensed physicians. To be eligible for clinical education training and credit, students must be in good academic standing, successfully complete required courses in Semesters I through IV, pass the Clinic Entrance Exam, as well as have current CPR certification. The course of study consists of four academic years each consisting of two 18-week semes- ters, as well as some summer and holiday clinic shifts. coURSE IDEnTIFIcATIon All CNM courses are identified with the letter \"N\" as the first letter in the course description, e.g., NBS511 Anatomy I.

College of Naturopathic Medicine83Elective Courses Elective courses are offered to allow spe- cialization and/or certification in various ar - eas of naturopathic practice. Some, but not all, licensing jurisdictions require a specific minimum number of didactic hours for the practice of` these specialties. Currently, the following courses are offered as electives by the college: NNP 712 Generative Medicine INNP 828 Generative Medicine II NCE 821 IV Therapeutics GRADES Grades earned by students are submitted to the Registrar utilizing the following designa- tions. Grades earned are on a four (4)-point scale with an \"A\" or 4 quality points being the highest grade attained. GRADE QUAlITY poInTS A 4.0 B+ 3.5 B 3.0 C+ 2.5C 2.0 F 0.0 The cumulative quality point ratio (QPR) is determined by dividing the number of semes- ter hours into the number of points earned. Transfer credits are not included in this com-putation. Clinic Grades are: Satisfactory (S) or Failure (F). Refer to the UBCNM Student Handbook for policies regarding a grade of \"F\". Administrative Grades In addition to the Academic Grades submit-ted by faculty, the following Administrative Grades are also utilized: I (Incomplete), TCR (Transfer Credit), and W (Withdrawal). I: The grade of Incomplete (I) may be requested by a student and is used by the faculty, with the prior approval of the Associate Dean, to indicate that a student has not completed all course requirements for approved reasons. These include documented medical emergencies of the student or imme- diate family member. To be eligible for an Incomplete, a stu- dent must have attended a minimum of 75% of the course hours. The fac- ulty member and the Associate Dean may approve the student's request for an Incomplete. Upon approval, the faculty member and Associate Dean will determine the time granted to complete the course requirements. Once the student has completed course requirements within the ap- proved time frame, the faculty mem- ber will submit the earned grade. If the requirements are not completed within the approved time frame, the course grade will be converted from an \"I\" to an \"F\". Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will not be eligible to register for courses for which that course is a pre- requisite without approval by the As- sociate Dean of Academic Affairs. TCR: Transfer credit granted for equivalent graduate work completed at another accredited institution. W: Withdrawal grades are assigned on the following policy statements: If a student officially withdraws from a course during the official change-of- registration period, that course does not appear on the student's transcript. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the end of the change-of-registration period, but before the end of the official withdrawal period, a grade of \"W\" is assigned and that course remains on the student's tran- script. Courses with a grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR. The names of students who have of- ficially withdrawn from a course and receive the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the balance of the semester. Any exceptions must be approved by the Associate Dean of Academic Af- fairs. Academic Policies See the UBCNM Student Handbook for the most current and complete description of Col- lege policies and procedures.ATTEnDAncE REQUIREmEnTS Each student is expected to attend all lectures and laboratories and other activities asso- ciated with the total completion of a given course. Certain courses are offered on eve-nings and weekends. A detailed description of the attendance poli- cy can be found in each course syllabus. REQUIREmEnTS FoR GRADUATIon In order to be eligible for graduation from UBCNM, candidates must: 1. Complete all requirements of the edu-cational program with a minimum 2.50 cumulative grade point average. 2. Receive a recommendation for gradua-tion by the UBCNM Faculty and Admin-istration. 3. Fulfill financial obligations to the College and University Office of Financial Aid. 4. Complete, at a minimum, the last three semesters in residence at the UBCNM, by transfer and/or advanced-standing students. All requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within seven years from the first matriculation to graduation. SATISFA cToRY A cADEmIc pRoGRESS A student is considered to be meeting sat-isfactory academic progress by maintaining a QPR of 2.5 or greater with no outstand- ing grade of \"F\". Good academic standing is achieved when a student maintains a GPA of 2.5, has met all financial responsibilities to the College, and is free of any breach of the stan-dards governing ethical and clinical conduct. Academic Probation, Remediation, and Dis- missal AcADEmIc pR obATIon Academic probation occurs when the stu-dent's GPA or QPR falls below 2.50, or student has a grade of \"F\" in one or more courses A student who is on Academic Probation is not in good academic standing, and may not be allowed to carry a full academic course load. In addition, a student on Academic Proba- tion may not participate in the UBCNM clinic, outreach clinic sites, preceptorships, or any activities associated with clinical education. College of Naturopathic Medicine84A student on Academic Probation must meet with the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs to create a plan for successful completion of the program. AcADEmIc DISmISSAl A student, who, after one semester of Aca-demic Probation, does not show substantial improvement in his or her academic perfor - mance, may be subject to dismissal from the program. Additionally, Academic Dismissal may occur if a student is placed on Academic Probation for a second time, for any reason. A student whose GPA falls below 2.0 at any time may be subject to dismissal from the program. Any student who is subject to dis-missal may appeal to the Dean (see Appeals and Disciplinary Action). non-A cADEmIc DISmISSAl FR om ThE collEGE Naturopathic medical students are expected to demonstrate ethical and professional be- havior at all times. The following incidents may be cause for dismissal from the program: 1. Failure to meet the generally accepted standards of professional conduct and clinical practice. Dismissal of this nature is subject to a review of a committee of peers, faculty and administration. 2. Pleading guilty or \"no contest,\" or being found guilty of any crime involving mor - al turpitude or being felonious in nature. 3. Repeated violation of public policy, or the demonstration of behavior that created safety hazards and/or disrupts the order of the institution. 4. Failure to meet financial obligations or commitments to the College. See the College Student Handbook for a com-plete description of policies and procedures for Non-Academic Dismissal. lEAVE oF AbSEncE AnD WIThDRAWAl FR om ThE pRoGRAm If a student requests a Leave of Absence from UBCNM, and is in good academic and finan- cial standing with the College, s/he is eligible for readmission for up to one year from the date the leave begins. After one year, the Leave of Absence expires and the student must reapply for admission to the College through the Admissions Office. A Medical Leave requires medical documen- tation from a physician that states that the stu- dent must take leave to recover from illness or injury. Before returning to the program the student must provide medical clearance that allows full participation in academic and clini- cal activities. After one year, the student must reapply for admission to the College through the University Admissions Office. A student who withdraws from the University must reapply for admission to the College in order to be readmitted to the program. If a student fails to register for a semester without taking a Leave of Absence at any time before completion of the naturopathic program, s/ he is considered to have withdrawn from the program. lf a student takes a leave one or more times from the program, the cumulative absences must not exceed three years. A Leave of Absence or Withdrawal requires the student to complete all required paper - work from the University's Registrar's and Fi- nancial Aid Office. READmISSIon T o ThE pRoGRAm A student on Leave of Absence must notify the Dean, and reapply for admission through the University's Admissions Office in writing that s/he is intending to return to the program at least one month before the beginning of the semester of anticipated return.

General Criteria for the A.S. and the B.S. Degree in Dental Hygiene The two year basic core curriculum of the Fones School combines courses from the College of Arts and Sciences and the Fones School of Dental Hygiene to provide a broad educational preparation. In addition to basic and dental science theory, the program pro- vides education in preventive service and dental health education. During the second year, the students re- ceive clinical education at the Fones Den- tal Health Center on campus, and through assignments to the clinical and educational facilities of school dental health programs, hospitals and community agencies. These assignments are directly supervised by Fones faculty. Students are responsible for providing their own transportation to com-munity agencies. A student who earns a grade of C- or below in a course in the major field, must obtain a written statement from the School Director specifying the procedure necessary to rem- edy the deficiency and remain in the major. Enrollment in the second year is contingent on completing all first year requirements and achieving a QPR of 2.0. Education at the baccalaureate level en- hances the dental hygienists' opportunities, abilities, background and values. The pro-89fessional dental hygiene curriculum is com- bined with a liberal arts education. Upon satisfactory completion of 122-125 credits in the areas of study specified, the student will be recommended for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene. Students in the Bachelor of Science degree (B.S.) may integrate the Bachelor's courses with the clinical aspect of the Dental Hy- giene curriculum or pursue a Baccalaureate degree (B.S.) after completing clinical prep-aration at the Associate in Science Certificate Level. This Baccalaureate degree comple-tion approach is available to Fones' students and graduates of a Dental Hygiene program that is accredited by a specialized accred- iting agency recognized by the Council on Post Secondary Accreditation and the United States Department of Education.

Make-up examinations due to absence WILL NOT will not be permitted without an approved legitimate excuse with full documentation (see makeup policies) and will result in a grade of zero for that exam. Students ARE NOT PERMITTED to leave class prior to 5pm unless prior authori- zation is received from the Assistant Director and this would require the same guidelines for approval as an absence. Prior approval must be sought during normal administra- tion business hours Monday - Friday. Those who leave class early without prior approval or subsequent documentation of illness or emergency that meet the guidelines speci-fied under makeup policies below will be penalized with a 20% grade deduction on their course grade. mAkE-Up polIcIES WEEkEnD cAmpUS AnD onlInE FoRmAT Make-up examinations and assignments will not be permitted without a legitimate excuse or prior approval from the instructor and as- sistant director and will result in a grade of zero. An acceptable excuse for prolonged illness, or family emergency, entitling a stu- dent to a make-up examination, requires a legitimate detailed doctor's note (with diag- nosis) by a U.S. licensed physician or official documentation of family emergency, which must be submitted to the Program Assistant Director and approved. Please note that only one make-up examination is allowed per course regardless of instructor approval. Missed exams must be taken before the next scheduled examination and may be modi-fied and made more difficult by the instruc- tor. Make-ups will not be granted for reasons of personal convenience, such as traveling, weddings and vacations. GRADInG polIcY Online exams are timed. Your syllabus should define for you the time limit on the 94Nutrition Institute exam as well as when you log onto Canvas to complete it. Your are permitted to log onto the exam only ONCE and complete it in the required time frame. Students cannot log in and out of exams. Once submitted, the exam cannot be accessed again. Time limits set by the professors must be adhered to. Students who exceed the time limit on the exam, (this is reported to the instructor automatically) will receive a grading penalty equal to the percentage of excess time they took. For example, if an exam was sched- uled for 60 minutes and the student took 66 minutes to complete it, they would have exceeded the exam time by 10%. Therefore their exam grade would be penalized 10% of the total possible points for the exam. If exam was 100 points, then 10% would equal a 10 point deduction. Repeated violations of exam time may result in further grading penalties and will be reported to the pro- gram assistant director for review. FRAGRAncE FREE polIcY on cAmpUS Many individuals are sensitive to perfumes and other scents (such as scented oils, scent- ed laundry soaps, scented deodorants, etc.) and have adverse health reactions upon ex-posure. In order to maintain an environ- ment that is conducive to health and learn- ing for all students and faculty members in the classroom, the Nutrition Institute has a \"fragrance free\" policy. The use of products that produce a noticeable odor and/or cause an adverse health reaction in other individu- als is prohibited. The use of such fragrances while attending class will be considered as a Violation of the Rules of Conduct. plAGIARISIm polIcY Plagiarism is taken very seriously in the program. The UB policy on plagiarism can be found in the student handbook, Ch 2 at: http://www.bridgeport.edu/life/services-forstudents/key.aspx Students are also highly encouraged to take the on-line tutorial in avoiding unintentional plagiarism at http://www.indiana.edu/~istd/ Please be advised that UB faculty have ac- cess to \"Turn It In\" software which scans electronically for plagiarism from any pub-lished source and your assignments and discussion board posting may be screened using this tool.Ethics Statement of Confidentiality Students enrolled in the program are ex- pected to honor confidentiality as it pertains to student disclosure.

EVAlUATIon AnD GRADInG The GPA is determined based on the fol-lowing scale. A = 4.00, A- = 3.67, B+ = 3.33, B = 3.00, B- = 2.67, C+ = 2.33, C = 2.00, C- = 1.67, D+ = 1.33, D = 1.00, I = Incomplete, W = Withdrawal, R = Research in progress. Any course with a grade of C- or a numeri- cal grade of 73 or less must be repeated to earn graduate credit. Other courses may be repeated if the student needs to raise the GPA. When a course is repeated, only the second grade will used to calculate the GPA. Tuition must be paid again for all classes that are required to be re-taken (no exceptions). Evaluation and grading are the responsibil- ity and province of the professor. All stu-dents in a course will be graded consistently or equivalently. Students may be penalized for late or missed work. Questions regard-ing grades should be addressed to the course professor. GRADE DISpUTES A disputed grade may be appealed in writ- ing as follows: First Appeal: Directly to the instructor with- in 30 days of receipt of grade Second Appeal: To Assistant Director of Nu- trition Institute Third Appeal: To Director of Nutrition Insti- tute/Vice Provost of Health Sciences Final Appeal: To the Provost95TRAnSFER cREDITS The Program Director, with the Dean's ap- proval, may allow up to six semester hours (eight hours in the case of laboratory cours- es) of graduate transfer credits from a region- ally accredited college or university. The courses being considered for transfer must have been completed within the past seven years, with a grade of \"B\" or better, and be comparable to the University of Bridgeport's graduate courses. Physicians (i.e.: medical, osteopathic, chiropractic, naturopathic, etc.) may request advanced standing for 560A and 560B. However, many choose to take 560B (Biochemistry) if they have not had the course in many years, as a review and prep- aration for course 560D (Clinical Biochemis-try). Advanced transfer credit for physicians will only be granted for courses where a grade of \"B\" or better was achieved. IncomplETE coURSEW oRk An \"I\" (Incomplete) designates incomplete work at the time of grading for reasons be- yond the control of the student, fully docu- mented, and corresponding to UB makeup policies as stated above, and determined to be bona-fide by the instructor and the As- sistant Program Director. If approved by the assistant director and the instructor, in- complete coursework must be completed by the end of the semester immediately following the one in which the incomplete was granted. If the work has not been com- pleted and no grade has been submitted as indicated, the grade automatically becomes F. STUDENTS WHO ARE FAILING A COURSE ARE NOT PERMITTED TO TAKE AN INCOM- PLETE AND REPEAT THE COURSE TO AT - TAIN A NEW GRADE. A GRADE OF \"F\" WILL BE ISSUED AND THE COURSE WILL HAVE TO BE REPEATED BY RE-REGISTERING FOR THE COURSE. GooD A cADEmIc STAnDInG pRobATIon AnD SEp ARATIon Good academic standing is achieved when a student maintains a 3.0 GPA. If the GPA drops below 3.0, the student will be placed on academic probation. A student, who re-ceives a second grade of \"D\" or \"F\" in any course, or is placed on probation in two dif- ferent semesters, will be separated from the program. In cases of academic probation, the student should consult with the Program Assistant Director for advice and planning to raise the GPA. In cases of separation from the program, a student may make a writ-ten appeal to the Director within ten days of the notification of separation. If an ap- peal is granted, the student will remain on academic probation and his progress will be monitored periodically during the semester. RESEARch In nUTRITIon - coURSE 560J The research project can be taken as an elective, and is not required, as part of the Human Nutrition Program. The project can be a literature-based study or an original re-search project. Students have one semester to complete the project before incurring a fee. If thesis completion exceeds the one semester limit, the student must maintain continuous matriculation by registering for ADMIN 600, each semester, until the thesis has been completed. Graduation Requirements The minimum number of credits required for graduation is 41; the minimum GPA re- quired is 3.0. Students are expected to com- plete class work for the degree within five years of initial enrollment in the program. Successful completion of ALL sections of the comprehensive competency examination is required for graduation. This examination and all required re-takes are given on-site on the UB campus on a Saturday (exact dates published several months prior to each ex- amination) and will not be given by proctor at other sites or on alternate days of the week (no exceptions). If you cannot take exami- nations on a Saturday for any reason please consider the above policy before entering the program. Study guides and sample ques- tions will be available to all students eligible to sit the examination by the distance learn-ing department. Any sections that are not successfully completed must be re-taken on the UB campus at assigned dates. Only two attempts will be allowed without remedia- tion, as assigned by the program director. Nutrition Institute96Physician Assistant Institute Director: Daniel Cervonka Eleanor Dana Hall 30 Street Telephone: (203) 576-2399 M. Taafel, B. McCambley, P. Possenti, I. Broderson The University of Bridgeport Physician As-sistant Institute is committed to the develop- ment of highly qualified physician assistants who will serve as tomorrow's leaders in the delivery of patient centered health care, educational and professional service. An understanding of the importance of integrat-ed medicine and an appreciation of global health issues will be woven into all phases our curriculum Degree Master of Science: Physician AssistantAccreditation The University of Bridgeport Physician As-sistant Institute Accreditation Continued sta- tus until 2020 by the Accreditation Review Committee for Physician Assistant Education. All students graduating from an accredited program are eligible to sit for the national certification examination. Mission Statement The mission of the University of Bridgeport Physician Assistant Institute is to develop cli- nicians with: dedication to patients; commit- ment to life-long education; respect for the profession; a global perspective on health care; volunteerism as a professional core val- ue and an integrative approach to practice for the benefit of all patients. This mission to educate the physician assistant is reflected in our motto: Adiuvare, Mederi, Communiter; TO HELP, TO HEAL, TOGETHER. Curriculum The physician assistant curriculum is com-prised of a rigorous 28 month Master of Sci- ence Program. The goals and objectives of our program are guided by the criteria set forth in the Standards and Guidelines for an Accredited Educational Program for the Physician Assistant as established by the Ac-creditation Review Commission on educa- tion for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA). The first four terms are made up of primarily classroom instruction. The intensity of our didactic curriculum is matched by the rigor of the clinical phase of the program and the unique relationship that we have with the St. Vincent's Medical Center and many com- munity medical practices. The didactic phase of our curriculum provides a comprehensive background in the basic and clinical sciences which includes courses in human anatomy and physiology, microbiology, genetics, pharmacology, history taking and physical examination, clinical medicine, procedural skills, medical ethics, global medicine, in- tegrative medicine and patient education and counseling. Course content is presented through traditional lecture, blended instruc- tion, case based and hands on skills labs. The curriculum is overseen by primary fac-ulty and may include University of Bridge- port basic science and health professional faculty, practicing physician assistants, phy-sicians and providers who have the exper -tise in their respective specialty. The clini-cal year exposes the student to the areas of family practice, internal medicine, pediat- rics, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency medicine, general surgery and psychiatry. The student is also given the opportunity to choose two electives in an area of interest. The didactic and clinical phases of curricu-lum are designed to enable the student to acquire proficiency in the competencies of the physician assistant. Program Objectives In the design of the curriculum and clinical experiences it is the goal of the Physician Assistant Institute: To develop self motivated and high quality graduates committed to self discovery and self assessment through the application and eval- uation of clinical practice obtained through critical evaluation of the medical literature. To develop highly competent Physician As- sistants evidenced by the ability to transfer knowledge from the classroom and clerk- ship experience to graduate clinical perfor - mance through: Successfully passing the National Certify- ing examination Acquisition and application of the basic and clinical sciences Understanding the diversity amongst pa-tients, ideas, perceptions of care, and cul-ture while respecting the values associated with their ethnicity, sexual orientation and background. Developing an appreciation for patient preferences and the diversity of the treat- ments and healers they seek. The ability to implement effective commu- nication skills to colleagues, patients and families they encounter to improve patient care and outcome. To develop a solid professional value sys-tem, committed to life-long learning, profes-sional development and advocacy for the profession. It is the intention of the University of Bridge- port, Faculty of Health Science and the Phy- sician Assistant Institute to endeavor to com- municate these goals through our teaching, role modeling and clinical practice.97Competencies for the Physician Assistant Profession Preamble In 2003, the National Commission on Cer - tification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA) initiated an effort to define PA competen- cies in response to similar efforts being con-ducted within other health care professions and growing demand for accountability and assessment in clinical practice. The follow-ing year, representatives from three other national PA organizations, each bringing a unique perspective and valuable insights, joined NCCPA in that effort. Those organiza- tions were the Accreditation Review Com- mission for Education of the Physician As-sistant (ARC-PA), the body that accredits PA educational programs; the Association of Physician Assistant Programs (APAP), the membership association for PA educators and program directors; and the American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA), the only national membership association repre- senting all PAs. The resultant document, Competencies for the Physician Assistant Profession, is a foundation from which each of those four organizations, other physician assistant orga-nizations and individual physician assistants themselves can chart a course for advancing the competencies of the PA profession. Introduction The purpose of this document is to commu-nicate to the PA profession and the public a set of competencies that all physician assis- tants regardless of specialty or setting are ex-pected to acquire and maintain throughout their careers. This document serves as a map for the individual PA, the physician-PA team and organizations that are committed to pro- moting the development and maintenance of these professional competencies among physician assistants. The clinical role of PAs includes primary and specialty care in medical and surgical prac- tice settings. Professional competencies for physician assistants include the effective and appropriate application of medical knowl-edge, interpersonal and communication skills, patient care, professionalism, practice- based learning and improvement, systems-based practice, as well as an unwavering commitment to continual learning, profes-sional growth and the physician-PA team, for the benefit of patients and the larger community being served. These competen-cies demonstrated within the scope of prac- tice, whether medical or surgical, for each individual physician assistant as that scope is defined by the supervising physician and appropriate to the practice setting. In 1999, the Accreditation Council for Gradu- ation Medical Education (ACGME) endorsed a list of general competencies for medical residents. NCCPA's Eligibility Committee, with substantial input from representatives of AAPA, APAP and ARC-PA, has modified the ACGME's list for physician assistant prac-tice, drawing from several other resources, including the work of Drs. Epstein and Hun- dert; research conducted by AAPA's EVP/CEO, Dr. Steve Crane; and NCCPA's own ex- amination content blueprint. The PA profession defines the specific knowledge, skills, and attitudes required and provides educational experiences as needed in order for physician assistants to acquire and demonstrate these competencies. mEDIcAl kno WlEDGE Medical knowledge includes an understand-ing of pathophysiology, patient presentation, differential diagnosis, patient management, surgical principles, health promotion and disease prevention. Physician assistants must demonstrate core knowledge about estab- lished and evolving biomedical and clinical sciences and the application of this knowl- edge to patient care in their area of practice. In addition, physician assistants are expect-ed to demonstrate an investigatory and ana- lytic thinking approach to clinical situations. Physician assistants are expected to: understand etiologies, risk factors, under - lying pathologic process, and epidemiol- ogy for medical conditions identify signs and symptoms of medical conditions select and interpret appropriate diagnostic or lab studies manage general medical and surgical con- ditions to include understanding the in-dications, contraindications, side effects, interactions and adverse reactions of phar - macologic agents and other relevant treat-ment modalities identify the appropriate site of care for presenting conditions, including cases and those requiring referral or admission identify appropriate interventions for pre- vention of conditions identify the appropriate methods to detect conditions in an asymptomatic individual differentiate between the normal and the abnormal in anatomic, physiological, labo-ratory findings and other diagnostic data appropriately use history and physical findings and diagnostic studies to formu- late a differential diagnosis provide appropriate care to patients with chronic conditions InTERpERSonAl & commUnIcATIon SkIllS Interpersonal and communication skills en- compass verbal, nonverbal and written ex- change of information. Physician assistants must demonstrate interpersonal and commu-nication skills that result in effective informa- tion exchange with patients, their patients' families, physicians, professional associates, and the health care system. Physician assis- tants are expected to: create and sustain a therapeutic and ethi- cally sound relationship with patients use effective listening, nonverbal, explana- tory, questioning, and writing skills to elicit and provide information appropriately adapt communication style and messages to the context of the indi-vidual patient interaction work effectively with physicians and other health care professionals as a member or leader of a health care team or other pro- fessional group apply an understanding of human behav- ior demonstrate emotional resilience and sta- bility, adaptability, flexibility and tolerance of ambiguity and anxiety accurately and adequately document and record information regarding the care pro-cess for medical, legal, quality and finan-cial purposes pATIEnT cARE Patient care includes age-appropriate assess-ment, evaluation and management.

Physician assistants are expected to: work effectively with physicians and other health care professionals to provide pa- tient-centered care demonstrate caring and respectful behav- iors when interacting with patients and their families gather essential and accurate information about their patients make informed decisions about diagnostic and therapeutic interventions based on pa- tient information and preferences, up-to-date scientific evidence, and clinical judg- ment develop and carry out patient management plans counsel and educate patients and their families competently perform medical and surgi- cal procedures considered essential in the area of practice provide health care services and education aimed at preventing health problems or maintaining health pRoFESSIonAlISm Professionalism is the expression of posi-tive values and ideals as care is delivered. Foremost, it involves prioritizing the inter - ests of those being served above one's own. Physician assistants must know their profes- sional and personal limitations. Professional- ism also requires that PAs practice without impairment from substance abuse, cognitive deficiency or mental illness. Physician assis- tants must demonstrate a high level of re-sponsibility, ethical practice, sensitivity to a diverse patient population and adherence to legal and regulatory requirements. Physician assistants are expected to demonstrate: understanding of legal and regulatory re- quirements, as well as the appropriate role of the physician assistant professional relationships with physician supervisors and other health care provid- ers respect, compassion, and integrity responsiveness to the needs of patients and society accountability to patients, society, and the profession commitment to excellence and on-going professional development commitment to ethical principles pertain- ing to provision or withholding of clinical care, confidentiality of patient information, informed consent, and business practices sensitivity and responsiveness to patients' culture, age, gender, and disabilities self-reflection, critical curiosity tive pRAcTIcE-b ASED lEARnInG AnD ImpR oVEmEnT Practice-based improvement includes the processes through which clini- cians engage in critical analysis of their own practice experience, medical literature and other information resources for the purpose of self-improvement.

The clinical clerkship sequence will be indi-vidually assigned to students by the Director of Clinical Education. Emergency Medicine - The Emergency Med- icine clerkship gives the physician assistant student direct involvement and experience in a hospital Emergency Department setting. This will provide the student with practical clinical experience in the diagnosis, evalu- ation, and management of a wide range of emergent medical, orthopedic, traumatic, and surgical conditions. Students will par - ticipate in the care of pediatric and adult pa- tients in all triage acuity classifications. This experience consists of a six week supervised clinical experience in an affiliated hospital emergency department designed to further develop the concepts of diagnosis and man- agement acquired during the pre-clinical course-work and to develop decision-mak- ing and cognitive skills related to patient care in an emergency room. This course will also provide the student a chance to de- velop additional clinical psychomotor skills by performing routine basic procedures in a supervised setting. By the completion of the rotation, the student will have gained an appreciation for the delivery of emergency medical care as well as an understanding of the role of the PA in the Emergency Depart- ment setting. Family Medicine - This six week clinical clerkship is designed to expose the student to a variety of common ambulatory care situations. Settings vary, but experiences are centered around primary care, general medicine, and family practice. Students are responsible for eliciting chief complaints, gathering pertinent historical data, and per - forming relevant physical examinations. Stu-dents are also expected to develop problem lists, diagnostic impressions and therapeutic plans. These are to be presented to the pre- ceptor in an organized, thoughtful manner. Students are expected to attend conferences on primary care problems when offered and participate in other assigned activities. Internal Medicine - This 6 week clerkship is designed to provide an opportunity for the student to build on previous didactic experi-ence and begin to develop competence in clinical medicine. The student is exposed to patients with a wide group of acute and chronic medical conditions. This clerkship will emphasize skills in gathering historical data, examination of patients, and provide the opportunity to perform a variety of diag- nostic and therapeutic procedures. Students will interpret laboratory, EKG, and a variety of radiology studies. Students will formu- late treatment plans; participate in discharge planning and patient education. Obstetrics and Gynecology - This six week clerkship is designed to provide the student with exposure to common prenatal and gy- necological problems. Hospital and clinic settings offer the student a wide range of out-patient and/or inpatient experience. The stu- dent will become confident with the routine gynecological evaluation and patient educa-tion. The student may have the opportunity to participate in labor and delivery. Emphasis is placed on data gathering, differential diag-nosis, patient management, maintenance of medical records, performance of diagnostic and therapeutic skills, follow up care and the provision of health education and counseling. Pediatrics - This six week clerkship is de- signed to provide the student with exposure to common pediatric problems. Emphasis is placed on assessment and management of normal and abnormal growth and develop- ment, as well as acute and chronic disease states. The student will develop skills in ob- taining historical information and examining the pediatric patient. While most of the ex-perience will occur in the office setting, the student will have the opportunity to be in- volved on the pediatric inpatient setting also. Psychiatry/Behavioral Medicine - This six week clerkship provides students experience in working with patients who have psychiat-ric, behavioral or substance abuse problems. Emphasis is placed on the recognition and Physician Assistant Institute100management of these problems. The student will learn how to do a mental status exam and medically assess the patient to screen for non psychiatric causes of the patient's clinical presentation. The student will be in- volved in treating patients with psychiatric as well as co-occurring disorders with alcohol, benzodiazepine or opiate dependence. Surgery - This is a six week clerkship on an inpatient surgical service with hospital operating room experiences. The student is exposed to the concepts and principles which characterize the practice of medicine in general surgery, while participating in the pre- and post-operative evaluation and care of surgical patients. The role of the physician assistant student on the general surgical ser - vice includes performing the admission histo-ry and physical examination, monitoring and recording patient progress on daily rounds, performing and/or assisting with diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, assisting the surgeon in the operating room; participating in the post-operative care and management of patients, in addition to providing patient/family education and support. GRADInG The Physician Assistant Institute letter grade system for courses is as follows: Grade Quality p oints A 4.00 B+ 3.50 B 3.00 C+ 1.00 Considered Failing F 0.00 P/F Courses in this grading category are not calculated in the GPA I For Incomplete coursework W Withdrawal from Course Clerkship grades will use the same scale as the didactic courses. Administrative Grades I The grade of Incomplete \"I\", is used by the faculty to indicate that a student has not completed all course requirements. A student will have one week from the last day of the term to meet with the faculty and complete all course require- ments. Upon completion of the course requirements the faculty will submit the earned grade. Failure by the student to meet with the faculty and complete the requirements in one week from the last day of the term will result in the grade of \"I\" being converted to a grade of \"F.\"Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will be required to register and retake that course in it's entirety when the course is regularly scheduled. Any student with a grade of \"F\" or \"W\" will not be eligible to register for courses for which that course is a prerequisite. W Withdrawal grades are assigned based on the following policy statements: 1. If the student officially withdraws from a course during the official change-of registration period, that course does not appear on the student's transcript. 2. If a student officially withdraws from a course after the end of the change-of-registration period, but before the end of the official withdrawal period, a grade of \"W\" is assigned and that course remains on the student's tran- script. Courses with a grade of \"W\" do not count toward the QPR and do not count toward \"hours attempted.\" 3. The names of students who have of-ficially withdrawn from a course and receive the grade of \"W\" are so listed on the class roster for the balance of the semester. 4. Any exceptions to the above, including late withdrawals, must be approved by the Director and the Vice Provost for Health Sciences before they become of- ficial and are recorded. Poor academic performance doe s not constitute a val- id reason for late withdrawal. Since courses in the Physician Assistant Pro-gram are sequential a withdrawal would pro- hibit the student from continuing. Academic policies Academic policies used to manage and di- rect the academic program are: 1. Attendance Requirements 2. Requirements for Graduation 3. Good Academic Standing4. Academic Warning, Probation and Dismissal 5. Dismissal from the College (Non-Academic) 6. Withdrawal from the Program 7. Readmission to the Program DIDA cTIc AppEAlS pR ocESS A student may appeal a grade, first to the instructor and then to the Director of Aca- demic Affairs and finally the Director. If after appeal to the Director, a student remains un-satisfied, then an appeal may be presented to the Progress and Promotions committee. In this latter instance, the appeal must be based on substantive academic grounds. Clinical Clerkship Appeals Process: A stu- dent may appeal a grade, first to the Director of Clinical Education and finally the Direc- tor. If after appeal to the Director, a student remains unsatisfied, then an appeal may be presented to the Progress and Promotions committee. In this latter instance, the ap- peal must be based on substantive academic grounds. ATTEnDAncE REQUIREmEnTS In the Physician Assistant Program, it is ex-pected that all students will assume respon- sibility for meeting all academic and clinical obligations with punctuality. Student atten-dance is expected in all classes and repre- sents a component of professionalism. Stu- dents remain responsible for all of the work in the courses in which they are registered. Students must arrive at all educational and clinical sessions with the necessary lab in-struments, texts, attire, and other materials as designated by the instructor, or may oth- erwise be excluded from participation in the activity. Students not properly prepared for competencies will not be evaluated. Make up competencies for lack of preparation will not be offered. Acceptance into the Physician Assistant Insti- tute at the University of Bridgeport requires a full-time commitment. It is an intense and rigorous program that is demanding.

Students whose GPA drops below a 3.000 while in the program will be placed on academic probation. SATISFA cToRY A cADEmIc pRoGRESS Students enrolled in the Physician Assistant Institute Master of Science degree program are in good academic standing and are mak- ing satisfactory academic progress; if they have successfully achieved the following cri- teria upon completion of their most recent semester of course work: 1. Did not receive a grade of \"F or D\" in any course, and 2. Maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or better. A student who has not achieved the above criteria is not making satisfactory academic progress will be evaluated by the Director and the Progress and Promotion committee and will be required to follow the criteria as outlined in the catalog regarding Academic Probation and Dismissal. pRoGRESS AnD pR omo TIonS Each student will be presented by the fac- ulty to the progress and promotions commit- tee. The committee meets toward the end of the didactic period and once again prior to graduation. The committee is charged with the responsibility to assure that students are maintaining progress. If a student is not progressing as expected the committee may make recommendations for remediation or dismissal. AcADEmIc ADVISInG Students will be assigned an academic advi-sor upon admission to the program. Students will meet with their advisor at least once per term to discuss progress and any problems they may be experiencing. REmEDIATIon Student progress will be monitored with enough frequency to ensure that deficiencies in students' knowledge, skills and profes- sionalism are identified in a timely fashion. Once identified, students with deficiencies will be required to enter the program's re- mediation process. Students will meet with course directors and their faculty advisors to identify the nature and underlying causes of the problems. Opportunities for remediation will be identified and the program will work with students to their fullest ability. Reme- dial actions may include referral for tutoring, time management, study skills enhancement, test taking strategies, and/or personal coun- seling. Faculty advisors will meet regularly with students for documentation and follow- up. For further details please refer to the full policy in Appendix A of the Physician Assis-tant Institute student handbook. AcADEmIc pR obATIon Graduate students must have a 3.000 cumula-tive GPA to be eligible to graduate. Graduate students whose cumulative GPA falls below a 3.000 will be placed on academic proba-tion and will receive written notification of this status. At this point it is the student's responsibility to meet with his or her advi-sor. In order to be removed from academic probation, the student will need to achieve a cumulative GPA of 3.000 within his or her next term of study. Failure to do so may sub- ject the student to immediate dismissal from the program at the discretion of the Program Director. pRoGRAm WIThDRAWAl Any student wishing to withdraw from the PA program must submit this in writing to the Program Director detailing the reason for withdrawal and expected plans if any, to return. A student who withdraws in \"good standing\" academically, will be allowed to reapply to the program after an interview with the program administration without going through the full admissions process. An exit interview with the Program Director will be required. A student in this category will be required to interview once again with program administration before readmission is approved. Students who are withdrawing due to issues of an academic nature will be required to exit interview with Program Director and the Director of Academic Affairs to delineate a plan, detailing requirements for readmission. A student in this category will be required to interview once again with program adminis- tration before readmission is approved. DISmISSAl At any time a student can be dismissed from the program for academic or professional be- havioral reasons. Any student in jeopardy of dismissal from the program will be notified in writing and have the option to respond. If necessary, an AD HOC Progress and Promo- tions committee will be convened and the issue presented. All recommendations of the committee will be presented to the Program Director for final action. DISmISSAl FR om ThE collEGE Academic inadequacies are not the only rea-sons for dismissal from the College. The fol- lowing is a list of additional causes for dis- missal: 1. Failure to meet the generally accepted standards of ethical conduct and clinical practice. Dismissal of this nature is subject to review by a committee of peers, faculty and administration. 2. Pleading guilty or \"nolo contende,\" or be- ing found guilty of any crime involving moral turpitude or being felonious in na- ture. 3.

ELI also organizes off-campus trips and on-campus activities designed to introduce international students to the United States, its language and its people. ELI classes are offered year round, Monday through Friday. Full-time students attend class in the mornings and afternoons. Part-time students can choose to attend mornings or afternoons. For full-time students, a typical day consists of 5 hours of instruction, includ-ing classroom instruction in grammar, com- position, reading, listening, and speaking, and assigned work in the university's state-of-the-art language laboratory. ELI provides highly individualized instruction. Classes are limited to 15 students per teacher. ELI students receive a University of Bridge- port student I.D. card and are entitled to use facilities on the campus of the University of Bridgeport, such as the Wahlstrom Library and the Wheeler Recreation Center, to name but a few. Admission ELI students must have a strong personal commitment to learning the English language. Courses in English as a Second Language are offered year-round at all levels from beginner through advanced. ELI application forms and additional program information may be ob- tained at the above address or may be print-ed out directly from the ELI Internet address shown above.Applicants must be at least 17 years old. Ap- plications are accepted at any time of the year and new students may begin class through- out the year. International Admissions issues an official letter of admission to the program and an I-20 form promptly upon receiving a completed ELI application.

After receiving the I-20 issued by ELI, the prospective student may apply for an F-1 student visa at an American embassy or con- sulate prior to coming to the United States. Why Students Enroll at ELI Many students wish to enrich their knowl- edge of the English language while on leave from a school or a job in their home coun- try. Most of these students return to their home country after a stay at ELI of from 7 weeks to a full year or more. Many ELI students plan to apply for admis- sion to a degree program at the University of Bridgeport. They improve their knowl- edge of English to meet the English lan-guage requirement for university admission. These students usually obtain \"conditional acceptance\" to a degree program and will receive full acceptance when they satisfy the University's English language requirement for admission. It should be noted that suc- cessful completion of ELI's advanced level satisfies the English language requirement for admission to the University of Bridge- port. ELI graduates are not required to take the TOEFL or IELTS.The Curriculum The curriculum of ELI focuses on improving skills in speaking, listening comprehension, writing, and reading. At all levels of the cur - riculum, ELI instructors seek to help students improve their language skills through active use of the language both in and out of the classroom. New students complete a placement test upon arrival and are placed in the appropriate level of English. Successful completion of the ses-sion allows the student to move up to the next level. Students who are placed in the lower levels concentrate on basic grammar, speaking, lis- tening, and reading skills, and practice para-graph writing. As students progress through the levels, they continue to improve their speaking and listening skills while taking on more challenging tasks in reading and writing. In the advanced levels, students strive to achieve competence in language-dependent tasks similar to those that are required of na- tive speakers of English in both academic and career-related activities. These include read-ing for content; note-taking from spoken and written materials; speaking skills needed to relate information, to persuade, to negotiate, and to inquire; and skills needed in essay and report writing, as well as in effective corre- spondence. Graduates of ELI receive a \"Certificate of Com- pletion\" which certifies that they have met the English language requirement for admission to the University of Bridgeport. Grades reports are issued upon requ est. Schedule of Charges Please see insert for current academic year for tuition, fees, and other expense. ELI students should plan on spending about $200 per 8-week session to cover required books and miscellaneous personal expenses such as recreational travel, local transporta- tion, books, laundry, clothing, etc. Application Forms and Additional Information Prospective students may obtain application forms, credit card charge forms, insurance information, etc. at ELI's Internet site, by email, or by calling or faxing ELI.106Ernest C.

To this end the University has established a Pre-Law and a Pre-Health advisory program. Pre-Law Studies Advisor: Timothy Mandeville Fax: (203) 576-4388 E-mail: traynor@bridgeport.edu While no single curricular path is the ideal preparation for law school, a broadly based undergraduate program that includes train - ing in analytical reasoning and writing will serve you well. Law schools want students who can think, read, and write and who have some understanding of the forces that have shaped human experience. You can acquire these attributes in any number of college courses, whether in the humanities, the social sciences, or the natural sciences. English language and literature courses are virtually indispensable. At the same time, every law student should be aware of the in - stitutional processes of government through which much of the law is made and applied. You can gain this awareness through study in political science. Because the law is in - separable from our historic experience, you should have some acquaintance with Ameri - can history. The fact that many legal subjects are intimately concerned with economic relations among individuals, and with the structure and development of business en - terprises, makes a knowledge of macro and microeconomics valuable. Statistics, account - ing, and computer science are other courses that will help you to understand special legal subjects and the practice of law. Accredited law schools require that appli - cants take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). In the admissions process, law schools are primarily interested in the stu - dent's LSAT score, the student's GPA, and the intensity and depth of the student's un - dergraduate program, showing the student's capacity to perform well at an academically rigorous level.For more information on pre-law studies, check out the Law School Admission Coun - cil at www.lsac.org. Pre-Health Professional Studies Advisor to Pre-Health: Spiros Katsifis Charles Dana Hall 169 Fax: (203) 576-4262 E-mail: for General Studies Majors: Edward Geist Bryant Hall 271 Avenue Telephone: (203) 576-4956 Fax: 576-4051 Virtually all of the professional schools in these fields have the same minimum en - trance requirements: 1. Completion of 90 credit hours of college work or completion of a bachelor's de-gree, 2. Completion of laboratory science courses in the following subjects: Biology - 8 credit hours General Chemistry - 8 credit hours Organic Chemistry - 8 credit hours General Physics - 8 credit hours 3. Completion of a liberal arts core that in-cludes English composition, psychology, communications, humanities, social sci- ences, and the fine arts. Depending on the health profession and school some variation in these requirements does occur. The highest percentage of students admit - ted to health professional graduate schools major in biology with chemistry the second most common major. However, students ma - joring in any discipline, e.g. history, music, or psychology, are also viable candidates provided they satisfy the pre-requisites of the professional school to which they seek admission. The University of Bridgeport's Biology Ma - jor offers a B.A. or B.S. degree that provides a rigorous scientific and technical program for the pre-health professional student. See the Biology major for additional details. The University of Bridgeport's Bachelor of Science in General Studies (B.S.) degree program provides the student with the op - portunity to create a program, in consulta - tion with their advisor, that may fit the indi - vidual student's particular needs. The University offers a pre-Chiropractic program in the Biology major and the Gen - eral Studies major. These programs are of - fered with the cooperation of the Univer - sity of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic. In both programs the student may elect a 90-Credit Basic Option, Combined Bacca - laureate/Doctor of Chiropractic Option, or Complete Baccalaureate followed by Doctor of Chiropractic Option. See the description of the pre-chiropractic program elsewhere in the catalog. A pre-Naturopathic program is also of - fered in cooperation with the University of Bridgeport's College of Naturopathic Medi - cine. In this program a student must com - plete the bachelor's degree before entering the College of Naturopathic Medicine. See the description of this program elsewhere in the catalog. It should be noted that pre-health pro - fessional study in any of the above areas provides an excellent foundation for other careers in the health sciences, including os - teopathy, podiatry, physical therapy, optom - etry, and pharmacy. 108Pre-Professional Programs for Chiropractic The University of Bridgeport offers a pre- professional program for students prepar - ing for Chiropractic College, the Pre-Chiro - practic Program for undergraduate students. This program fulfills the prerequisites for all Chiropractic colleges in the United States and Canada, including the University of Bridgeport College of Chiropractic. Pre-Chiropractic Programs Three undergraduate options of pre-chi - ropractic are offered in the Biology and General Studies majors: 90-Credit Basic Op - tion, Combined Baccalaureate/Doctor of Chi - ropractic Option, and Complete Baccalaureate Followed by Doctor of Chiropractic Option. In both majors the student earns a bachelor's degree which provides requirements for en - trance into Chiropractic school. The University of Bridgeport's Biology ma - jor offers both the B.S. and B.A. degrees. The major provides a rigorous scientific and technical program for the pre-Chiropractic student. The program is described in the section on Biology degrees. The University of Bridgeport's Bachelor of Science in General Studies (B.S.) degree program provides the student with the op - portunity to create a program in consul - tation with their advisor, that may fit the individual student's particular needs. This program is described elsewhere in the cata - log under the General Studies major. Both of these majors fulfill the University of Bridgeport's College of Chiropractic's mini - mum entrance requirements, which are: 1. Completion of 90 semester hours of un- dergraduate course work with a mini- mum grade point average of 2.50 on a 4.00 scale. In addition to this the cumula-tive grade point average must be com- petitive with other applicants vying for seats in the College of Chiropractic. 2. Completion of the following specific cours-es as part of their professional prepara- tion: Communication/Language Skills 6 semester hours Psychology 3 semester hours Social Science 3 semester hours Humanities 3 semester hours Electives (Social Science/Humanities) 9 semester hours Biology 8 semester hours General Chemistry 8 semester hours Organic Chemistry 8 semester hours General Physics 8 semester hours 3.
