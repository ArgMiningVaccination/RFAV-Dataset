These bacteria are frequent inhabitants of the digestive trac t of poultry, and broiler is considered the main source of campyloba cteriosis. Campylobacter do not affect poultry health. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) publi shed in 2011 an opinion on Campylobacter in broiler meat production that exhaustively reviewed the scien tific literature, modelled the effect of a variety of interventions at different s tages of the food chain aimed at reducing the risk of campylobacteriosis. ANSES was requested by the French General Directorate for Food (DGAL) to update the knowledge on Campylobacter contamination of broilers and to assess the impact of intervent ions at different stages of the food chain in France. A group of experts from five European Member States was set up by ANSES for this purpose. The experts had been chosen for their compet ence in microbiology, technolog y and quantitative risk assessment. The experts gathered the scientif ic literature published since 2011, and organized hearings of representatives of the French poultry sector. They reviewed car efully the recent publications and the newly acquired knowledge. They listed the interventions that could be applied in France, in the current state of the European legislation. Then they proposed those that could be re asonably applied, with indication of their plausible effects. To calculate a \"baseline estimate\" of the number of campylobact eriosis cases in France, the mathematical CARMA model was used. It was c omplemented with two modules: one for the chilling and storage step, and one for the consumer stage. The latter used data acquired by AN SES to describe hygienic practices typical of the behaviour in French households. The model was run with data re levant to the manufacture of fres h fillets from broilers reared in-door. Then, the model was used to evaluate the effect of single or co mbined interventions at each stage of the food chain that is at the farm, the slaughter or the consumer l evel. Finally, the effect of combinations of interventions at the thr ee stages was evaluated. To compare the number of cases after intervention(s) to the bas eline estimate, a percentage of relative risk reduction was calculated as follows: % 1001 Importantly, with the modelling approach used here, whether bro ilers are reared in- or out-door (for most interventions), the part of carcass submitted to the interventi ons, the level of detection of analytical methods and the absolute value of the number of cases before interventi ons (whether underestimated or overestimated as it was in the present case) have no influence on the relative risk reduction. The Working Group conclusions are as follows: Almost no new data have been generated about the situation of Campylobacter in broiler products in France since the European ba seline study in 2008. However, various interventions at different stages of the food chain have been tested in France, in the EU and in the world since 2010. Up to now, no single intervention has been proven to be effective and applicable enough to be adopted by the broiler production secto r. Controlled trials on farms or in slaughterhouses are lacking and it is not possible to quantitat ively evaluate the efficacy and the applicability of these interventions in commercial conditions. The CARMA model, completed in this work, with a chilling module and a consumer phase, enabled to estimate the effect of a number of scenarios: At the farm, the model, according to its specific hypotheses, showed that the most effective interventions are those that reduce the contamination level on carcasses (CFU/g), rather than reducing the prevalence of contaminated carcasses. Therefore, a s soon as, for example, vaccination will be available, it m ight prove quite effective a t protecting public healt h. If, for instance, vaccination would achieve 1.5 decimal reductions of carcass con tamination level, the relative risk reduction would be 85%. At the slaughter plant, achieving one more decimal reduction o f carcass contamination by scalding or by reducing faeces leakage at the plucking or evisceration s teps would result only in a relative ANSES expert l report Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 9 / 81 June 2018 risk reduction of 3% or 4% in the present state of the slaughte r chain technology. By contrast, the chilling process seems to be ve ry effective and, as an example, the model shows that one DR of carcass contamination woul d reduce the risk by 76%. In the home kitchen, hand washing alone has a limited effect on campylobacteriosis incidence (1% reduction of relative risk). How ever, the cleaning of utensils to prevent cross contamination is effective. If, for example, recommendations on utensil cleaning were effective ly applied by all consumers, the relative risk reduction would be 85%. Per fect application of good hygien ic practice in the home kitchen would be highly effective. However, acco rding to a previous ANSES report on consumer information (2015) it may be difficult to change consumer behav iour. The experts tested also two scenarios including operations at the farm, at the slaughterhouse and at home. The effect of a combin ation of interventons is not strictly cumulative. The scenario with the weakest interventions would a chieve a relative risk reduction of 16% while the scenario with the str ongest interventions would achie ve a risk reduction of 99%. The results demonstrated that there is room for improvement of public health protection. However, a major relative risk reduction would need the application of intervent ions that are presently at the stage of experimentation and development (such as vaccination), improvem ent of hygienic design of slaughter machinery, as well as better compliance to good hygienic practi ces all along the food chain including by the consumers. Perfect application of good hygienic practices in th e home kitchen would be highly effective. However it is difficult to change consumer behaviour. Field trials should be done to measure the actual reduction eff ect of the interventions on faecal content, animal contamination and carcass contamination. The results of these trials, a survey on the acceptability by the farmers, an estimation of the future farmer compliance t o guidelines, etc. would have to be combined with those from a cost/benefit analysis (including the benefit of DALY reduction) in actual conditions. A further consideration to be accounted for would be the influe nce on the final result of the imported products contamination level and the proportion of these produc ts in the national consumption.

ANSES Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 13 / 81 June 2018 1. Context, objectives and realisation of the expertise 1.1 Context Campylobacter spp. is the most common cause of food zoonosis in France and i n Europe with a steady increase in the number of cases over the past fifteen years (Va n Cauteren et al. 2015, EFSA 2017). Monitoring plans show a high level of Campylobacter contamination in poultry and poultry products in France. Fifty to eighty percent of human campylobacteriosis in Europe is attributed to chicken reservoir as a whole according to EFSA (2011). To date, France does not have a national control plan for Campylobacter while several other EU Member States (e.g. Denmark (Rosenquist et al. 2009), Sweden (Hansson et al. 2007)) have implemented control measures several years ago. In this context, ANSES was requested by the French General Dire ctorate for Food (DGAL) to assess the risk of human campylobacteriosis and evaluate the impact of possible c o n t r o l m e a s u r e s i n t h e p o u l t r y m e a t sector. 1.2 Terms of reference as provid ed by the DGAL (letter in Annex 1) The request of the DGAL was to update knowledge about Campylobacter in broilers and chicken products, strategies for contro lling the risk posed by the contamination and their efficacy. The review had to focus on the French situation more specifically with emphasis on the imp act of consumers' practices on the risk of campylobacteriosis and on availability of analytic methods and their constraints. The Working Group, in agreement w ith DGAL received the followin g remit: 1 / Survey of control measures of Campylobacter in the poultry production, and of their improvement since the report of EFSA (2011). The effectiveness of control m easures should be documented at t he following steps: Placing on the market of live birds (breeder end product), Placing on the market of carca sses (abattoir end product), Purchasing at the retail level, Consumption. Consideration should be given to the performance of available a nalytical methods for the detection and enumeration of Campylobacter . 2 / Modelling of the French poultr y food chain from rearing to consumption with the view of: Assessing the risk of consumer disease, Selecting/optimizing the control measures with respect to thei r effectiveness per se and considering their cost effectiveness/efficiency. 3 / Cost-benefits analysis of risk reduction. 1.3 Terms of reference as retained in the present report The ToRs were all considered by the experts, with the following exceptions: The performance of available anal ytical methods for the detect ion and enumeration of Campylobacter was not accounted for because it has no influence on the effec t of interventions when the latter is expressed in relative terms. ANSES collective expert appraisa l report Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 14 / 81 June 2018 Concerning the cost-benefits analysis of the risk reduction, i t was not deemed a priority for the Working Group because it requires specific competences and data not easily available. Moreover, the Working Group decided to focus on food safety issues. The present report will focus on br oilers and not on other avia n sectors. 1.4 Modalities of treatment After a public call of experts, the Working Group \u00ab Campylobacter \u00bb has been established by ANSES to instruct the referral, under the supervision of the Expert Pane l on the evaluation of Biological Risks in Foods (so called BIORISK Committee). The Working Group had met on thirteen occasions from March 2017 to June 2018. The work of the WG was submitted on a regular basis to the BIORISK Committee, with reg ard to methodological as well as scientific aspects. The work was presented at the meeting of January 2017, January, May and June 2018. The WG report accounted for the comments and additions suggested by th e BIORISK Committee members and the reviewers. As a consequence, the final report is the product of an interactive and collective work of expertise done by experts with complementary competences. The work was pr esented and adopted at the CES BIORISK meeting of the 11th July 2018. The French Standard NF X 50-110 (May 2003) \"Quality in Expertis e - General Competence Requirements for Expertise\" was applied. 1.5 Data collection 1.5.1 Extensive bibliographical research The starting point of the experti se was the EFSA (2011) report. An extensive bibliographical rese arch of scientific articles pu blished since 2011 was conducted on the databases Scopus and PubMed with the search terms \" Campylobacter AND poultry AND control\". The request was made on the 26th of April 2017. 332 references were retained and grouped according to the follo wing topics: primary production: 192 articles, transport and slaughter: 68 articles, packaging and consumer and ki tchen practices: 42 articles, quantitative microbial ris k assessment: 33 articles. Two or three experts were designated to review the same list of references corresponding to the above four topics. A reading grid template (Annex 2) was provided to the e xperts. In the first window, the expert had to fill in their name, the referenc e of the article and its type ( article, grey literature, b ook, report), the country of origin, the poultry species. The expert indicated in the second window the stage in the food chain, the intervention and where its effe ct was measured, the type and si z e o f t h e s a m p l e s , h o w t h e e f f e c t o f t h e intervention was measured (relati ve risk, odds ratio, number of decimal reductions and standard deviation), and the expert had to provide an opi nion on the confidence with respect to the intervention effect. In the third window, the expert indicated if t he authors had any conflict of interest, if the intervention is applicable in France, and the bias identified. Only references with low and l ikely low bias and with relevant method were selected and experts of the work ing group could add articles an d reports along the work of the working group (see annex 3: Literature up date of interventions). 1.5.2 Hearings of representa tives of the poultry sector In addition to the review of the literature, two auditions of r epresentatives of the French poultry sector took place (see above t he section \"Hearing of Personalities\"). ANSES in 15 / 81 June 2018 1.5.3 Consumption data: survey INCA 3 The information on the dietary exposition was drawn from the th ird national consumption survey (ANSES 2017) ( https://www.anses.fr/en/ content/inca-studies ). The INCA3 study has used to provide the data. The INCA3 su rvey was conducted between February 2014 and September 2015, in metropolitan France, among 5855 ind ividuals (2698 children and adolescents from birth to 17 years old, and 3157 adults from 18 to 79 years old). The INCA3 survey population is representative of all individuals living in an ordinary househo ld in metropolitan France (excluding Corsica). To ensure the national represent ativeness of the results, the d ata have been adjusted according to a method defined in consultation with INSEE. 1.6 Prevention of the risks of conflict of interests ANSES analyses interests declared by experts prior to their app ointment and throughout their work in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest with regard to the mat ters dealt with as part of the scientific assessment. The experts' declarations of interests are made pub lic via the Ministry in charge of public health website ( https://dpi.sante.gouv.fr ) No interests or conflicts of in terest were identified during th e appraisal. ANSES collective expert l report Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 16 / 81 June 2018 2. Campylobacter and public health 2.1 Campylobacter Bacteria belonging to the genus Campylobacter are Gram-negative, spiral, rod-shaped, or curved, approximately 0.2 to 0.8 m wide and 0.5 to 5 \u00b5m long. These non-spore-forming bacteria a re chemoorganotrophs which obtain their energy from amino acids or tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (Vandamme et al. 2005). Most Campylobacter species grow under microaerobic conditions and have a respiratory type of metabolism. Yet, some species require hydro gen or formate as an electron donor for microaerobic growth, such as C. concisus or C. curvus. In addition, certain species prefer anaerobic conditions for growth (Man 2011). The optimal growth of this mi croaerophilic and capnophilic pathogen requires 5% of oxygen, 10% of carbon dioxide and 85% of nitroge n. In addition, its optimal temperature of growth is variable according to the species, but for the thermo tolerant species, which are mainly involved in campylobacteriosis cases, the opt imal temperature of growth is 42\u00b0C and minimal growth temperature is 30\u00b0C (Butzler 2004). Therefo re, in field conditions, Campylobacter cannot grow on the carcasses. The genus Campylobacter is comprised of several species isolated from human and animal cases, however, to date, those most commonly is olated from foodborne disease ar e the thermophilic species (EFSA ECDC 2017). Indeed, according to EFSA and ECDC (2017), human ca ses of campylobacteriosis are mainly due to C. jejuni in 83.6% of cases, followed by C. coli (8.5%), C. lari , C. fetus and C. upsaliensis . In France, C. jejuni (84%) and C. coli (13%) were the main species isolated from human cases in 2016 according to the National Reference Centre for Campylobacter and Helicobacter http://invs.santepubliquefrance.fr/content/ download/138051/497180/version/1/file/Bilan_ Campylobacter _2016.pdf ) This microorganism is widespread in the gut of domestic and wil d birds (Johnson et al. 2017, Jonaidi-Jafari et al. 2016, Weis et al. 2016), but can also commonly colonizes domestic livestock, incl uding cattle, goats, pigs, sheep (EFSA and ECDC 2017, Manyi-Loh et al. 2016) and in domestic carnivores (Pintar et al. 2015). In broilers, it has been observed that Campylobacter is more prevalent during summer (EFSA 2011). Campylobacter can be isolated from various env ironmental reservoirs, such as environmental water sources (EFSA and ECDC 2017) and soils. Although Campylobacter concentrations in this hydro-telluric environment is relatively low, the water of the rivers, ponds, lakes and pu blic swimming pools, can be a secondary reservoir of these ba cteria (ANSES 2011). 2.2 Campylobacteriosis In industrialized countries, Campylobacter is recognized as the highest cause of bacterial foodborne ente ritis and the associated illness is called campylobacteriosis. Patien ts affected by campylobacteriosis may experience mild to severe symptoms, with common clinical sympto ms including watery, sometimes bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fev er, headache and nausea. Infectio ns are usually self-limiting and last only a few days, however the reinfecti on is possible too. Despite the high number of human campylobacteriosis cases, their severity in terms of reported case fatality is low (0.03%) (EFSA and ECDC 2017). Moreover, C. jejuni infection can lead to autoimmune conditions known as Guillain- Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and can been associated with a ran ge of gastrointestinal condit ions, including inflammatory bowel diseases, Barrett's oesophagus (Man 2011). Post-infection complications, such as reactive arthritis and ne urological disorders, can also occur. Nowadays, C. jejuni has become the most commonly recognized antecedent cause of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, a polio-like form of paralysi s that can result in respiratory failure and severe neurological dysfuncti on and even death (EFSA and ECDC 2 017). According to Havelaar et al. (2012), the DALY associated with campylobacteriosis is 41 years for 1000 inhabitants in the Netherlands in 2009. 2.3 Epidemiology In the European Union, human campylobacteriosis is the most com monly notified bacterial food-borne disease with around 246 000 confirmed cases reported in 2016, r esulting in an EU notification rate of 66.3 cases per 100,000 population (EFSA and ECDC 2017). Broiler meat is considered the most important source of human campylobacteriosis (EFSA and ECDC Campylobacter in broilers page 17 / 81 June 2018 While Campylobacter sp. from the broiler reservoir is well recognized as an import ant source of human infection there is increasing ev idence that bovine reservoir al so plays an important role (Th\u00e9pault et al. 2017). A variation in assignments of French clinical cases ove r the years indicated the importance of a yearly based surveillance (Thepault, Quesne , et al. 2018). The contamination of bovine meat appeared to be low to absent (DGAL 2012), ther efore the environmental transmis sion (indirect transmission from cattle to humans via the environment) shoul d be investigated as a possibl e source of transmission to humans. Indeed, several other studies poi nted out the cattle reservoir as to be highly contaminated (Cha et al. 2017, De Haan et al. 2010, Hakkinen et al. 2007, Thepault, Poezevara , et al. 2018). In addition to be the main food-borne causative age nt in sporadic cases in the EU, this pa thogen is also responsible of strong-evidence outbreaks. Differently from 2014 when broiler meat was the most common foo d vehicle implicated in strong-evidence outbreaks caused by Campylobacter , in 2015 the most frequently reported food vehicle was raw mil k (14 outbreaks), followed by broiler m eat and products thereof (6 ou tbreaks) (EFSA and ECDC 2017). Recently the incidence of campylo bacteriosis in France in the g eneral population for the period 2008-2013 was estimated based on data rel ated to the probabilities of a c ase visiting a doctor, hav ing a stool requested, having a positive laboratory tes t and having the case reported to the national reference centre (Van Cauteren et al. 2018). The reported cases within this period were 4608 annually and the estimated incidence was 492,705 cases. The multiplicat ion factor between reported c ases and estimated cases was 115. Also, the number of hospitalisations due to a Campylobacter infection was considered. Annually 3088 cases were reported. Taking the diagnostic sensitivity of the stool cultur e into account the number increases to 5182 cases/year. Comparison of results for human salmonellosis indic ated that the under-estimation ratio of Campylobacter infections is much higher than for Salmonella infections, viz. 20. In France, a national case-control study was conducted from Sep tember 2002 to June 2004 to identify risk factors for acquiring sporadic Campylobacter infection. Results showed that the kitchen\" were the main independent risk factors for infection (Gallay et al. 2008). 2.4 Campylobacter in EU Food Regulation The prevention of food-borne zoonoses in general relies on EU R egulations N\u00b0 852/2004, 853/2004 and 854/2004 for food from animal origin. Before 2018, no specific regulation existed for the mitigation of the risk caused by Campylobacter in poultry meat. No coordinated action plan was carried out by the food business operators. A public health risk reduction > 50% or > 90% could be achieved if all batches would comply with microbiological criteria with a critical limit of 1000 or 500 C FU/gram of neck and brea st skin, respectively. The European Commission adopted the Regulation 2017/1495 amendi ng Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005. The text established a processing hygiene criterion (PHC) for Campylobacter applicable in broiler slaughterhouses. Coming into force on the 1st of January 2018, this Regulation introduced a microbiological PHC for Campylobacter on broiler carcasses after chilling (table 1). Over time, the maximum number of samples exceeding 1000 CFU/g of 50 neck skin samples will be re duced from 20 in 2018 to 10 in 2025.

To date, EFSA considered the use of trisodium phosphate, acidif ied sodium chlorite, chlorine dioxide or peroxyacid solutions to decontam inate the carcasses. All these chemicals are considered to be \"safe\" for use and effective in achieving the Campylobacter reductions required (EFSA 2011), but no authorisation has been granted so far at European level.

Organisation of the French poultry sector 3.1 The broiler sector 3.1.1 Poultry production In the European Union, France is the second largest producer of poultry meat, after Poland, with a global production reaching 1 872 000 tonnes of carcass equivalents (TE C) in 2015 (13% of the EU production). EU chicken meat represents two-thir ds of the French poultry meat p roduction and is the single poultry species showing an increase of the production over the last 5 years. Po ultry meat is the second meat consumed (26.3 kg per habitant in 2014) in France after pork meat; broil er is the most popular poultry meat and about 90% of the French households purc hase this meat. In 2015, about one quarter of broilers were sold as whole carcasses whereas cutting parts and elaborated products account respectively for 44% and for 31% of the purchases (Figures 1 and 2) (FranceAgriMer 2016). The consumption of chicken mea t (all products combined) has bee n stable for several years (figure 3). Figure 1 : Production of poultry meat in France from 2009 to 20 15 (FranceAgriMer 2016) Figure 2: Consumption of meat (kg per habitant) in France in 20 14 (FranceAgriMer 2016) TEC: tonnes of carcass equivalents ANSES Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 20 / 81 June 2018 Figure 3: Consumption of broiler meat in France from 2011 to 20 16 (in millions of tons carcass equivalent) The major household purchasing trends in mainland France concer ning broiler show a significant increase (+ 2.4%, 2016 vs 2015) of cuts (including + 3.6% for skinless fill ets) to the detriment of whole broiler (-7.7% over the same period). In 2015, hou sehold purchases were distri buted as follows: - Whole broiler 30% (of which tw o thirds of \"Label Rouge\"), - Broilers cuts 44%, - \"Elaborates\" of broiler 26%. All products combined, purchases are still predominantly in sup ermarkets (78%). 3.1.2 Main production systems in France French poultry production is very diverse. There are five main production systems for broilers (Table 2) with differences in housing conditions, genetics used and rearing pr actices. 1. The \" small standard \" production is a specific produ ction, mainly for exporting to third countries. The slaughter age is low (less than 39 days), allowing a high densi ty housing of birds (22-30/m2); these products are mainly sold as frozen. 2. The \" standard \" production is the typical \"French production\" for broiler. Ab out 10 to 15% of the flocks are thinned to meet abattoirs' demand for small and heav y broilers. This pro duct is mainly a 'ready to cook', that means eviscerated and chilled. These prod ucts could be cooked in different ways (e.g. roasted , barbecues, stew). 3. The \" heavy standard \" production is a new type, allowing to rear, in the same house , broilers for two different markets: the youngest (females) are designed to the t raditional \"Standard\" market, the oldest (male) for cutting and further processing. This producti on is the consequence of the market fragmentation including the increasing need of cut up (e.g. leg s, wings, fillets) a nd further processed products (e.g. nuggets, \"cordon bleu\"). Thinning of part of bro ilers occurs during the rearing period, after 39-41 days. 4. The \" certified\" production responds to specific requirements that are controll ed by independent certification organisms. The main features of the production ar e the use of medium growing strains, an extended rearing period (>56 days of age) and a lower rearin g density but broilers are kept inside the poultry house (no open-air r ange). About 75% of the flocks are thinned for the production of \"cockerel\" i.e. small broilers (28 days of age , 400 to 700 g) sold as whole ca rcasses. 5. The \" free range \" and the \" organic\" productions, mainly characterized by slow growing strains of broilers and the access to an open-air range. Organic productio n system meets the requirements set for organic production at Europ ean and national levels. For the free-range production system, a large 1003,81041,31075,21129,1 1142,81210,62011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016ANSES Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 21 / 81 June 2018 part of the production fulfils the specific requirements of the \"Label Rouge\" standard or the \"Protected Geographical Indi cation\" standard (INAO, http://www.inao.gouv.fr/eng/ ).

The Council Directiv e 2007/43/EC limits feed withdra wal to a maximum of 12 hours before the expected slaughter time (EFSA 2011). This operation consists of suspension of the availability of feed and water before transport to the sl aughterhouse a nd during transpo rtation. The transport of broilers to slaughterhouses is done in crates or cages. The duration depends of the distance between the farm and the slaughterhouse and cannot last longer than 12 hours according to the Regulation 1/2005, otherwise, broilers m ust be watered and fed. 3.3 Broiler slaughtering process Organisation of the slaughter ing and cutting processes: A slaughterhouse is an establishment for the preparation of mea t, the processing of by-products (edible or not) where these products are subject to a health inspection an d to the assessment of their quality. The approved establishments specializ ed or not, public or private, will thus allow the progressive transformation of a live animal coming from the poultry sector, in carcass, in meat and co-products. The combination of these steps represents the \"first transformation.\" Campylobacter in broilers page 22 / 81 June 2018 The production of poultry and rabbi ts' carcasses has remained v ery stable in France since 2008 (Figure 4, (ITAVI 2018)). Figure 4: Annual production from Fre nch abattoirs of poultry an d rabbits (in million Tonnes in carcass equivalent weight) (ITAVI 2018) The list of EC approved slaughterhouses for poultry, rabbits (a nd related animals) istesOfficielles/SSA1_VIAN_CO L_LAGO. pdf , consulted on 2018-04-16) shows, excluding the overseas departments and territories, in 2 016, a total of 684 approved establishments distributed according to their specialisation as described in T able 3. Table 3: Mainland France slaught erhouses distribution by activi ty in January 2016 rabbit or R : ratites Type of slaughterhouses A L R Mixed* Total Number 516 17 12 139 684 * A-L or A-R or A-L-R If one excludes the twenty-nine s pecialized slaughterhouses of rabbits and ratites, this data obviously covers a large diversity of structures, both in terms of specialisatio n (slaughterhouses of ducks, turkeys, broilers, etc.) and of production capacity expressed in TEC/d (tonnes in carcass equivalent weight per day). By contrast, operations constituti ng the slaughtering process are similar. Differences in general relate to the size of the equipment and the level of automation for certain steps. Figure 5 gives the distribution by species in mainland France a nd per year of slaughtering activities. Broilers (> 1 million TEC), turkeys (340,000 TEC) and ducks (234,000 TEC ) accounted for 94% of slaughtering in 2015 (ITAVI 2018). Figure 5: Distribution of species slaughtered in France (ITAVI 2018) In France, broilers slaughterhouses vary for their capacity (nu mber of birds slaughtered during one day) and the types of birds slaughtered. Furthermore, the line speed cou ld be different, from one hundred to several Million tonnes in carcass equivalent weight ANSES collective expert appraisa l report Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 23 / 81 June 2018 thousand birds slaughtered per hou r. As an example, there are s ome industrial slaughterhouses treating 500 000 for export carcasses per day, based on two or three shifts per day with two (four for evisceration) slaughter lines running in paralle l, when some establishments o perate one or two days per week and treating a few hundred of birds. Nevertheless, except for this \"small st andard production\" (higher water scalding temperature, water chilling and freezing), the slaughter proces s is quite similar. It consists of a succession of unitary operations. Some minor differences could be observed, d epending on the type and the capacity of slaughterhouses. In t he context of this repor t, the most import ant steps are described below: 1. Scalding : This operation is mainly don e to facilitate the next defeathe ring process step by dilatation of feathers' follicles. Carcasses are immersed during approxima tely 3 minutes in a tank containing hot water, the temperature being between 52 and more than 60\u00b0C, depending on the type of production (future carcasses to be chilled or frozen). It's imp ortant to determine these parameters (time and temperature) to maintain the integrity of the skin st ructure, mainly for future refrigerated products. In some slaughterhouses, scalding could be achieved i n 3 different successive water tanks, moving broilers against the water flow, from the dirties t to the cleanest one; this counter current process is efficient against the spread of some pathoge nic bacteria surviving the water temperature applied. Alternativel y, spray scalding could be app lied. This interesting system, for a hygienic point of view, chould be implemented for energy cost a nd water consumption considerations. 2. Plucking (Defeathering): Scalded carcasses are plucked using rubber fingers vigourously striking them in a horizontal and vertical direction; after this process , all the feathers have been removed from the carcasses. This step pr ovoques a pression on these une viscerated carcasses that could lead to spread of fecal mater in the plucking cabinet. For this operation water is used to drain feathers and clean the surface o f the carcass. 3. Evisceration : This operation allows keeping out offal's. It could be done m anually or automatically, during successive steps: the first one is to remove, by elongat ing the head, the neck, the oesophagus and the trachea. Next step is to keep out, after ope ning the visceral cavity, the heart, the liver and the intestines. The cluster of viscera has to rem ain close to the carcass, to perform the veterinary inspection. At the end, carcasses could be cleaned, internally and externally, using potable water, to eliminate faeces, blood, etc. which could be still present. 4. Chilling : This process is mainly done by storing the carcasses in a ven tilated room. The objective is to reach, as soon as possible, a temperature of 0 to +4\u00b0C. Thes e products are destined to the refrigerated commercial market or for the further processing. A fter chilling, carca sses are packed (polyethylene bag, vacuum or modified atmosphere). Some carcass es to be processed are not packed and are transferred to the cutting plant. For the small standard production (export), carcasses could be chilled in ref rigerated water, then packed a nd frozen. 3.4 Broiler further processing After chilling, some types of broiler carcasses are cut, manual ly or mechanically. This process separates wings, legs and breast (fillets) allowi ng further processing be fore sale. This should be done in refrigerated conditions, mainly to avoid an in crease of the temperature of t he products. At the end of the processing, they are packed in different way (polyethylene wrap, vacuum or modif ied atmosphere packaging) and sold in refrigerated conditions. 3.5 Organisation of the retail sector The main modes of presentation of the broiler at the consumptio n stage are given in the figure 6 (excluding offal). ANSES collective expert Campylobacter in broilers page 24 / 81 June 2018 Figure 6 : Mode of presentation of broiler at the consumption s tage 3.6 Part of imported product from EU or outside The French self-sufficiency rat e poultry meat production equall ed 106% in 2015 but importations accounted for 31% of the national consumpt ion (95% of the imported volume came from EU Member States). The share of imported products raises to 80% in catering and restaurants (Renault et al. 2013). ANSES collective expert appraisa l report Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 25 / 81 June 2018 4. Key points for Campylobacter contamination 4.1 At the farm level Epidemiology of Campylobacter contamination in broiler flo cks has been widely studied since 1990's. It is generally agreed that horizontal transmission is responsible fo r colonisation of broiler flocks (Evans et Sayers 2000, Hansson et al. 2010, Hermans et al. 2011, Newell et al. 2011) and several studies have identified risk factors inclu ding rapid turnover (Lyngstad et al. 2008), environmental contamination during the rearing period (Gibbens et al. 2001), poor maintenance of housing, inadequate cleaning and dis infection, manure storage on farm, farmers not wearing farm specific cloth ing and the presence of other animals (Cardinale et al. 2004). Flock age, farm size, flock size, water quality and seas on are also important factors (Evans et Sayers 2000, Refr\u00e9gier-Petton et al. 2001). Furthermore, thinning, (partial depopulation of a poultry unit) is regarded as a major risk factor for flock cont amination (Hermans et al. 2011, Torralbo et al. 2014). Identified sources of Campylobacter in broilers' environment include adjacent livestock (Ogden et al. 2009, Zweifel et al. 2008), staff (Ridley et al. 2011), insects and flies (Hald et al. 2008, Jonsson et al. 2012), pets (Whiley et al. 2013), rodents (Meerburg et al. 2006), equipment (Agunos et al. 2014, Battersby et al. 2016) and the environment around the broiler house (Ogden et al. 2009). Moreover, when key sites such as the tarmac apron, ante-room, house door, feeders, drinkers, walls, columns, barriers and bird weighing systems are not cleaned and disinfected pr operly, cross-contamination b etween successive flo cks is inevitable (Battersby et al. 2016). Age is a risk factor for Campylobacter colonization of broiler flocks (E vans and Sayers, 2000; Hartne tt et al., 2001; Bouwknegt et al., 2004). The birds are usually Campylobacter free for the first 2-3 weeks but once infected these bacteria grow rapidly in the caecum of the bird, are shed in the faeces and spread rapidly throughout the house. After 8 we eks, colonisation could decreas e in terms of number of bacteria and number of birds colonised which is likely to be associated with the de velopment of an adaptive immunity and changes in the intestinal microflora (Brena 2013). 4.2 Before slaughtering and du ring the slaughtering process The main reservoir of Campylobacter being the digestive tract, the c ontamination of the carcass is essentially superficial and may be provided by the living animal (during th eir rearing, catching, transport, lairage and hanging) or may be acquired post-mortem . The Campylobacter contamination in the depth of the muscles originating from digestive bacteraemia and/or evisceration defe cts is considered a very rare, if not improbable event. Therefore, digestive contents spreading is at the origin of the great majority of the contaminations and, consequently , all the steps (until the remo val of the digestive tract) of the process leading to faecal dissemination are considered as critical step s with respect to the transfer of Campylobacter to the skin or muscle surfaces. 4.2.1 Before slaughtering Feed withdrawal times longer than 12 hours could cause deterior ation in the condition and integrity of the viscera and increase the fluidity of gastrointestinal contents, which could increase the potential for faecal contamination of carcasses. The EFSA (2011) report shows the re sults of various studies performed in the last years, confirming that with increasing time of fasting bef ore slaughter, the number of Campylobacter increases exponentia lly in caeca (Byrd et al. 1998, EFSA 2011, Willis et al. 1996). Thus, faecal excretion can occur during transport and lairage i n a cage or in a crate. As an example, the norepinephrine hormone secreted by stressed birds, during the t ransportation, might stimulated colonisation and multiplication of Campylobacter , in the gut and then increased the possibility to contaminate the carcass (Cogan et al. 2007). Crates and cages have many n iches for accumulation of co ntamination, exacerbated by wear after repeated use, which damages surfaces and creates mor e sites for accumulation of dirt and biofilm formation. They are therefore very difficult to clean and disin fect. Thus, crates are potential source of ANSES l report Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 26 / 81 June 2018 contamination and cross-contami nation of the exterior of previo usly Campylobacter -negative birds transported for slaughter. However, in a study performed on 3 0 flocks followed from the fa rm to the slaughter, no si gnificant differences have been found between Campylobacter counts in caeca at the end of the rearing, during transport and lairage and at slaughter (Chemaly et al. 2010). 4.2.2 During the sl aughtering process The first critical step is probably the scalding operation, dur ing that step, many carcasses coming from many batches are immersed continuously in the same water tank. Scald ing is not done for a hygienic purpose, Yetfor Campylobacter , this operation seems to be effective in reducing the level of contamination (Pacholewicz, Liakopoulos , et al. 2015), as the temperature of the water is sufficiently high to inactivate Campylobacter . During plucking, an increase of the carcass contamination by Campylobacter sp. is frequently observed, probably due to cross contaminat ion. Indeed, aerosols containin g Campylobacter are formed during defeathering (Haas et al. 2005, Johnsen et al. 2007) and may cause significant carcass contamination (EFSA 2011). Evisceration is also a source of carcass contamination and cros s contamination (Corry et Atabay 2001), may be because of a defect in the proc ess resulting in broken intes tines and, consequently a spread of faecal materials to the surface of the carcass. The potential cross co ntamination can result f rom the impossibility to clean and disinfect utensils and machines between each operatio n. Evisceration step is described as dramatically increasing the prev alence of contaminated carcasse s, mainly by cross contamination (Seliwiorstow, Bar\u00e9, Van Damme , et al. 2016). Air chilling seems to be a critic al step to reduce the level of contamination, however contaminated carcasses remain positive. Globaly, during slaughtering, a decrease of the level of extern al skin contamination of carcasses could be observed, as a result of a comb ination of the favourable effect s of the temperature applied during scalding and air chilling and the unfavourab le roles of plucking and evi sceration (leakage). 4.2.3 During processing Portioning is usually done mech anically, with more possibilitie s for cross-contamination among carcasses via the machinery. Some portions, pa rticularly breast fillets, have the skin removed, which usually reduces the numbers of Campylobacter on the surface of the meat. 4.3 Cross-contamination in household kitchen Several French studies simulated common situations that could o ccur in domestic kitchens demonstrating that broiler meat may serve as a source for cross-contamination to other foodstuffs and surface during meal preparation. It was shown that Campylobacter from naturally contaminated broiler legs (bought in retail outlets) transferred to a cutting board in 80% of the cases aft er 10 min of contact (Fravalo et al. 2009). Another study examined the transfer of Campylobacter present in naturally contaminated raw poultry products (bought in retail outlets) to a cooked broiler product after a contact with a cutting board (Guyard- Nicod\u00e8me et al. , 2013). It revealed that transfer occurred in nearly 30% of the cases a nd that the main species implicated in human campylobacteriosis, C. jejuni and C. coli, were able to transfer from raw poultry meat to a ready to eat product via the cutting board. All the tested i solates were able to adhere and to invade eukaryotic cells revealing potential virulence properties for t hese isolates that could be in contact with the consumer (Guyard-Nicodeme et al. 2013). Recently, a survey of practices during the preparation of a chi cken meal was conducted. The objective was to investigate the habits of handling of chicken meat during th e preparation of the meal, and also to determine the proportion of risky behaviours that could lead to either direct or indirec t cross-contamination between the raw meat and food r eady to eat via hands or utensil s (Poisson et al. 2015) Annex 6). Data collected during this survey were used for the modelling of the present study. ANSES collective expert Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 27 / 81 June 2018 5. Review of French data 5.1 Campylobacter in caeca at the farm The European baseline survey performed in 2008 investigated the prevalence and level of contamination of Campylobacter in broiler caeca and on carcass es collected during the slaught ering process. Caeca samples collected during the evisceration process gave representative d ata reflecting the situation regarding Campylobacter contamination in French flocks. A pool of 10 caeca from 425 ba t c h e s o f b r o i l e r s w e r e sampled and analysed over a 12-month period in 58 slaughterhous es during evisceration and revealed information on Campylobacter prevalence and contamination level in French farms. Campylobacter spp. was isolated from 77.2% of caeca samples with a mean count of 8.0 \u00b1 1.0 log10 CFU/g (Hue et al. 2011, Hue et al. 2010). Two species C. jejuni and C. coli were found in caeca with 52.5% and 47.5%, respectively (Hue et al. 2011). The prevalence in caeca was 69.7% (CI free-ranged broilers. The difference i n prevalence between indoor and outdoor broilers has to be interpreted with caution due to the low numb er of free-ranged flocks investigated. However, the result is in line with a previous study where 100% of free-ranged flocks tested (N=73) were positive for Campylobacter at the end of the rearing period (Huneau-Salaun et al. 2007). An additional investigation to this study was achieved on a sub sample of 121 flocks produced in Brittany. On-farm information and cecal samples were collected 1-3 days b efore flock slaughter. Eighty-seven flocks were positive for Campylobacter, giving a prevalence of 71.9% with a mean co unt of 7.96 \u00b1 1.0 log10 CFU/g (Allain et al. 2014b). C. jejuni was isolated in 40.5%, C. coli in 29.8% and both species in 1.7% of the flocks. This study also facilitated the identification of the main risk factors affecting contamination of the flocks. Rodent control, antibiotic treatment at the beginning of rearin g and acidification of drinking water were associated with a decreased risk of contamination. Risk was inc reased during the summer months (Allain et al. 2014a). Only a few numbers of studies were carried out in France as a w hole since the baseline study in 2008. In 2009 Mahler et al (2011) reported that 87.1% (CI 95% [79.4-92.1], N=108) of the tested broiler batches carried Campylobacter in caeca after transport to the slaughterhouse. The mean cecal load was 8.0 \u00b1 0.9 log10 CFU/g. Campylobacter prevalence in broiler flocks in Reunion Island and specific pr actices associated to this contamination were studied from 2007 to 2009. Campylobacter was recovered from 54% of the 50 flocks involved in this work (Henry et al. 2011). This prevalence was lower to that obtained in Metropolit an France during the EU baseline survey. Ho wever, authors suggested the r equired willingness of farmers to cooperate during the lifespan of the flock might have led to a selection bias (Henry et al. 2011). Moreover, contrary to what was observed in Metropolitan France, C. coli was more prevalent than C. jejuni as they were isolated in 30% and 17% of the flocks respectively (Henry et al. 2011). Both species were isolated in 8% of the flocks (Henry et al. 2011). Regarding within flock prevalence French data are lackin g as all the above studies did not investigate this aspect. In a study involving 21 standard b roiler flocks reared under commercial conditions, the within flock pre valence reached 100% (8 broiler s sampled) within the two weeks after a natural infection by Campylobacter infection (Huneau-Salaun et al. 2018). 5.2 Campylobacter on carcasses at the slaughterhouse The EU baseline survey conducted at the slaughter level in 2008 gave representative data regarding the contamination of carcasses of t he French broiler production. On e carcass from each of 425 batches of broilers was sampled after the chilling process. This study revealed that 87. 5% of the carcasses were contaminated with a mean count of 2.39 \u00b1 0.08 log10 CFU/g (Hue et al. 2011, Hue et al. 2010) and that 15.4% of the samples presented Campylobacter enumeration above 3 log10 CFU/g (EFSA 2010) . A positive correlation between the mean of Campylobacter in caeca and on carcasses was found but a higher prevalence was observed in carcasses indicating that cross cont amination does occur during the slaughtering process (Hue et al. , 2010; 2011). The main species identified on carcasses were C. jejuni and C. coli (57.1% and 42.5% respectively) (Hue et al. 2011). This study was completed by i dentifying potential risk factors for Campylobacter contamination status of carcasses. Slaughter age of the broilers (over 68 days) appeare d to have a great impact on the prevalence; older broilers presenting higher prevalence (Hue et al. 2010). However, this assumption needs to be taken ANSES collective expert appraisa l report Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 28 / 81 June 2018 with caution as older broilers are from different broiler produ ctions (free-range, \"Label-Rouge\", organic production) using different rea ring conditions and broiler bree ds. A recent study conducted in France evaluated the mean Campylobacter concentration on carcasses (after chilling). Using a method accounting for censored data, the mea n contamination level on pooled neck skin samples was assessed to 2.6 [2.4; 2.8] log10 CFU/g during June- to-December period, whereas this during January-to-May period (1.0 [0.6; 1.3] log10 CFU/g) (Duqu\u00e9 et al. 2018). A monitoring plan of the \"Label Rouge\" production focusing on Salmonella surveillance and other microbial quality indicators has been extended to enumeration of Campylobacter since 2007. Sampling was performed in every French slaughterhouse slaughtering \"Label Rouge\" broil ers and included neck skin samples from 2007 to 2008 and leg skins samples since 2009 as leg skins are more representative of the potential exposure of the consumer. Results of this monitoring plan from 2007 to 2014 have been recently published (Salvat et al. 2017). From 2009 to 2014, only 2% to 5% of carcasses (from leg skins) presented more than 3 log10 CFU/g. Between 2008 and 2009 a significant decrease fro m 19% to 3% of heavily Campylobacter contaminated carcasses was noticed but was probably due to the change of analysed samples from neck skins to leg skins (Salvat et al. 2017). 5.3 Campylobacter on fresh meat at the distribution A monitoring plan concerning fresh broiler meat was carried out in France from April to December 2009. A total of 361 broiler meat products (carcasses, legs and fillets ) were collected from in retail outlets in geographic areas representing the most significant consumption patterns in France (DGAL 2010). Campylobacter was detected on 76% of these products. Products packed with ai r presented higher contamination than products packed under modified atmosphere (R ivoal et al. 2011). Products with skin were significantly more heavily contaminated than products with out skin. Prevalence and enumeration of Campylobacter was 90% and 1.90 log 10 CFU/g respectively on the carcasses, 85% and 1.72 log 10 CFU/g on the legs and 53% and 0.82 log 10 CFU/g on the fillets (Guyard-Nicodeme et al. 2013). C. jejuni or C. coli were isolated from 46.5% or 34.9 % of the broiler meat products resp ectively and both C. jejuni and C. coli were isolated from 18.9% of the broiler meat products. These results indicated that French broiler meat could be an important source of ex posure to these isolates. 5.4 Current measures contributing to the control of Campylobacter in France In France, the first requirements for biosecurity are at farm l evel and were specified in the official program for prevention and control of Salmonella in poultry production in 1998. From that date, the official plan was regularly upgraded (2001, 2008, 2013 and a new version is in pr eparation). The regulation on biosecurity has strongly evolved following the Avian Influenza outbreaks during the winters 2015-2016 and 2016-2017. The new regulation enforces measures to prevent contact of birds wi th wildlife ones and to improve sanitary measures (before entering in poultry house, disinfection practi ces of poultry houses etc.). However, the measures are being implemented slowly on the farms due to the t ime needed for modifications of buildings; the full implementation of the ne w biosecurity regulation is ex pected for 2018. In 2011, a Good Hygienic Practice s Guide for slaughter and proc essing poultry was validated by the National Competent Authority (Guide des bonnes pratiques d'hygi\u00e8ne et d' application des principes describes all the operations. Concerning the Campylobacter issue, this guide described thermotolerant Campylobacter as a biological hazard and proposed control measur es, especially during the evi sceration step. At the retail stage, the national federation of trade and retai l companies (\"F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des entreprises du commerce et de la distribution\") has published new microbiologi cal criteria applicable from 1st January 2015 to retailers and hard discount brands. In addition to updating the criteria with regard to regulatory changes and the updating of Regulation (E C) 2073/2005, this publication includes new criteria relating to Campylobacter in poultry. The list of new criteria could be found via the Campylobacter in broilers page 29 / 81 June 2018 6. Review of recent literature on the efficacy of the different interventions, and selection of interventions In the following, the interventions listed in the EFSA (2011) r eport are presented, complemented by knowledge acquired since. 6.1 Interventions during primary production 6.1.1 List of interventions EFSA (2011) proposed a list of interventions against Campylobacter before and during slaughter and processed operations. For this WG, the list has been updated wi th new results from literature. Each intervention is discussed in rega rd of the French situation in standard and free-ranged broiler flock. 6.1.1.1 Biosecurity In the case of Campylobacter , biosecurity essentially aims to prevent the introduction of t he bacteria or the carryover of the bacteria from one infected flock to the follow ing flock reared in the same poultry house. New evidence of the effect of biosecurity on Campylobacter prevention is mainly obtained from risk factor studies (Borck H\u00f8g et al. 2016, Chowdhury et al. 2012, Georgiev et al. 2017, Sommer et al. 2013, Sommer et al. 2016). Interventional studies or randomized controlled trials i n farms to measure the effect of biosecurity measures on Campylobacter contamination of poultry floc ks are generally lacking. Hygiene barriers: in France, all commercial poultry houses are equipped with an a nteroom where farmers and visitors have to change boots and clothes. For free-range b roilers reared in small shelters there is no anteroom at the entrance of the shelter. A rearing area is deli mited around the shelters. Farmers and visitors have to change boots or use a boot dip before entering into the rearing area. Reinforcement of hygiene barriers for avian influenza pr evention since 2016 may reduce t he prevalence of Campylobacter positive flocks. However, more time is re quired to evaluate this develop ment. Despite the high number of farms equipped with hygiene barriers in France, there is still a problem of compliance with biosecurity measures during the whole rearing p eriod. Results are contradictory about the effect of audit on the compliance to biosecurity measures. Raci cot et al. (2012) reported that a bimonthly audit had no impact on biosecurity compliance after a 6-months period. In contrast, Sandberg et al. (2017) observed a significant decrease in the prevalence of Campylobacter positive flocks after an audit visit for evaluating biosecurity appliance on the farms. In France, all f armers had to follow a one-day training period on biosecurity after the avian influenza crisis. In addition, a n annual veterinary audit is carried out on all poultry farms housing more than 250 birds since 2013 (Ministeri al Order of 26 June 2013). In 2018, the main objective of the audit was to evaluate the compliance to new bi osecurity measures introduced in the regulation on avian influen za prevention in 2016. Sommer et al. (2016) estimated the relative public health risk reduction from using an anteroom with hygiene barrier to be between 3 and 13% i n five European countries. (He re the \"public health risk\" is the incidence of campylobacteriosis due to the handling and consumption of broil er meat). Fly screen: use of fly screens to prevent Campylobacter introduction by flies turned out to be a protective measure in several Northern Eu rope countries especially during the summer period (EFSA 2011). The main challenge is to determine whether this intervention might be ef fective in other European countries with a high prevalence of Campylobacter in poultry flocks and with climatic conditions different from those in Northern Europe. Currently French poultry houses are not equipped with f ly screens. Van Wagenberg et al. (2016) estimated the relative public health risk reduction from the application of fly screens to be 14% in Denmark. ANSES collective expert 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 30 / 81 June 2018 Cleaning and disinfection, downtime period: Battersby et al. (2017) investigated cleaning procedures within broiler houses and by testing the efficacy of the most c ommonly used methods and also evaluated the six most commonly used commercially available disinfectants and /or detergent products. Of the six disinfectant treatments checked, most were ineffective. Thermal fogging with the combination of potassium peroxymonosulfate, sulfamic acid and sodium chloride (5%, and quaternary ammonium complex (0.3%, v/v) were the best treatment, achieving up to 5 decimal reductions in total viable count. According to the poultry sector representatives, cleaning and d isinfection of the poultry house is done after all flocks. Thermal fogging is c ommonly used for final disinfec tion in conventional poultry houses. In free range and organic farms procedures for cleaning and disinfectio n are more heterogeneous than on conventional farms. In particular the range of disinfectant pro ducts available is limited for farms complying with organic farming rules. Only two-thirds of the farmers in o rganic farms disinfected the poultry house between flocks (Souillard et al. 2017). A long downtime period before flock placement (more than two we eks) was reported as a factor increasing the risk of a flock being positive for Campylobacter both in Denmark (Borck H\u00f8g et al. 2016) and in the UK (Georgiev et al. 2017). The probability of poultry house contamination from exte rior sources (rodents, human vectors, etc.) may increase wi th the downtime period if the hyg iene barriers are not respected after the building has been disinfected. Thes e results are partly in cont radiction with those obtained previously (Hald et al. 2000, Lyngstad et al. 2008) making it difficult to come to a definite conclusion. In addition, the downtime period is generally shorter than two weeks in conventi onal farms in France. The question may be raised for free-range and organic farms as requirements for tho se productions impose a downtime period longer than 14 days for convent ional poultry house. Sommer et al. (2016) estimated the relative public health risk reduction from reducing the downtime to less than ten days to be between 2 and 8% in five European countries. Drinking water: untreated drinking water is a potential source of broiler conta mination by Campylobacter as the bacteria is commonly isolated from surface water (Mughini-G ras et al. 2016). Several new studies also suggest that type of drinkers and hygiene of drinkers may play a role in broiler contamination by Campylobacter . Use of drinker bells and nipples with cups is a risk factor f or broiler infection in comparison with nipples without cups in Denmark (Borck H\u00f8g et al. 2016). Improper disinfection of drinkers leads to a residual contamination of the material (Battersby et al. 2017) and to an increased risk of carry-over of Campylobacter from a contaminated flock to the following one (Battersby et al. 2016). Sommer et al. (2016) estimated the relative public health risk reduction from using drink nipples without cups to be between 5 and 24% in five European countries. No data are available regarding the origin of drinking water (p rivate water supplies or public water system) used in French poultry farms. However, all studies carried out by ANSES in poultry farms showed that drinking water is systematically treated (by chlorination mostl y) when it comes from surface water supplies (Quatrehomme et al. 2001). All farms producing conventional poultry are equipped wi th nipples but it is not known the proportion of farms using nipples without cup. In fre e-range and organic farms about one half of the houses are equipped with drinker bells and one half with ni pples. The new poultry houses are all equipped with nipples. Reduction of slaughter age: reduction of slaughter age is only applicable for standard prod uction (no specific requirement on age at slaughter). Van Wagenberg et al. (2016) estimated the relative public health risk reduction from reducing t he slaughter age to 35 days or le ss to be between 10 and 18% in five European countries. Discontinued thinning: thinning consists in a partial depopulation of a flock; a part of the broilers is sold at a younger age, one week to one mont h before the rest of the flo ck. Thinning is different from sequential depopulation at the end of the rearing period which consists in sending broilers to the abattoir in several shipments over two to three days. Thinning requires ingress int o the poultry houses by poultry catchers and material (crates, vehicles). As a consequence; biosecurity is o ften compromised during thinning. Thinning is therefore a major risk factor o f broiler contamination by Campylobacter . More recently, Georgiev et al. (2017) demonstrated that removing thinning may reduce by one third the number of heavily contaminated broiler flocks in the UK. However, poultry farmers in UK were reluctant to ban thinning as it is considerably more expensive than improving biosecurity (Fraser et al. 2010). In France thinning is used in standard, heavy and certified bro iler production to meet m arket requirements for carcasses of different sizes. ANSES collective expert l report Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 31 / 81 June 2018 Van Wagenberg et al. (2016) estimated the relative public health risk reduction from a ban on thinning to be between 4 and 13% in five European countries. 6.1.1.2 Bacteriocins No recent publications of in vivo studies were found in the period reviewed by the working group (2011- today). The use of bacteriocins seemed promising, but no field trials had been done to measure their effect (EFSA 2011). 6.1.1.3 Bacteriophages Fischer et al. (2013) tested a single phage and a cocktail of four phages on b roilers. A significant reduction (up to 2.8 decimal reductions cecal contents) was observed betw een one and four weeks after treatment. In field trials in three commercial broiler flocks, the phage cock tail applied in drinking during the 4 days before slaughter reduced the Campylobacter load in caeca by up to 3 decimal reductions in naturally conta minated broilers (Kittler et al. 2013). However, the results were not consistent over the three trials. 6.1.1.4 Vaccination and passive immunisation Annamalai et al. (2013) undertook studies on a vaccine with or without a poly(la ctide-co-glycoside) nanoparticle (NP) encapsulated outer membrane proteins (MOP) of C. jejuni . Chickens were vaccinated subcutaneous or orally with do ses (25, 125, or 250 \u00b5g) of candi date nanoparticle vaccine. C. jejuni colonisation in and cloacal contents at 7 days post chall enge was below the detection limit in the vaccinated groups. It was concluded that the subcutaneous vacci nation with or without NP encapsulated OMP of C. jejuni may serve as a candidate vaccine for control of C. jejuni colonisation in broilers. Neal-McKinney et al. (2014) used recombinant surface-exposed proteins implicated in colonisation of chickens for vaccination and could obtain a reduction greater t han 2 log 10 in the level of C. jejuni colonisation. However, trials were performed in SPF broilers pl aced in isolator chambers and authors concluded that further studies are needed to test the efficacy of this strategy on field conditions. Other vaccination strategies have also been tested in vivo . Studies reported the use of a whole-killed C. jejuni vaccine (Okamura et al. 2012), immunisation with an attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium strain producing a C. jejuni CjaA antigen (Laniewski et al. 2014) or in ovo immunisation with flagellin (Radomska et al. 2016) but these strategies had no effect on Campylobacter colonisation. Passive immunisation has also been evaluated these last years. Oral administration of C. jejuni -specific single-domain antibodies significantly reduced C. jejuni colonisation of day old SPF leghorns but future experiments are needed to address the effectiveness in the prev ention of C. jejuni colonisation over the full growth cycle of the chicken (Riazi et al. 2013). On the other hand, oral administration of hyper-immunize d egg yolk powder enriched with C. jejuni colonisation associated protei ns had no effect on cecal coloni sation of C. jejuni (Paul et al. 2014). Recently, new vaccine candidates against Campylobacter have been identified following the reverse vaccinology approach (Meunier, Guyard-Nicod\u00e8me, Hirchaud , et al. 2016). Six out of 14 new candidates have been produced and tested on live birds inoculated with C. jejuni and four out of them reduced significantly cecal Campylobacter loads by 2 to 4.2 log10 CFU/g, w ith the concomitant developmen t of a specific humoral immune response (Meunier et al. 2017). 6.1.1.5 Feed water additives Organic acids : organic and fatty acids have been extensively tested for the pr evention and reduction of Campylobacter in poultry (Jansen et al. 2014, Meunier, Guyard-Nicod\u00e8me, Dory , et al. 2016) tested the acidification of drinking water with a commercial organic acid mixture over three consecutive flocks in a conventional poultry house. The ac idification of water tended t o decrease the number of Campylobacter in broiler caeca at slaughter but had no significant effect on car cass contamination. The protective effect of organic acids observed in challenge trials seems to be difficul t to reproduce in commercial conditions. Another strategy is to combine organic acids with other additiv e also exhibiting an inhibitory effect on Campylobacter . (Grilli et al. 2013) developed a combination of o rganic acids and plant extrac ts that reduced Campylobacter load in caeca of challenged broilers up to the time of slaught er. A combination of a cation exchange clay-based product in feed and an organic acid mixture in water significantly reduced the load of ANSES collective expert appraisa l report Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb in broilers page 32 / June 2018 Campylobacter on neck skin of free-ranged broile rs but this experimental resu lt needs to be confirmed in commercial conditions (Guyard-Nicod\u00e8me et al. 2017). (van Bunnik, Hagenaars , et al. 2012, van Bunnik, Katsma , et al. 2012) tested the effect of water acidification with a commercially available acid on the horizontal transmissi on of Campylobacter within a flock but the protective action was not repeatab le over successive trials. Si milarly, a commercial available acidification water treatment significantly reduced Campylobacter counts in drinking water in vitro but had no effect on Campylobacter load in caeca of broilers at sl aughter under commercial condit ions (Haughton et al. 2013). Professional representatives rep orted that water acidification is commonly used in free-ranged broilers to improve gut health. It also used in standard flocks but apparen tly to a lesser extent. (Allain et al. 2014b) that water acidification was a protective factor for Campylobacter contamination in French broiler flocks (OR: 0.33, [0.13-0.86]). Based on this study, systematic application of water acidification might reduce by 20% the number of Campylobacter positive flocks. Howeve r, the result of Allain et al. was contradictory with those of a former risk-factor study in French broiler flocks: water acid ification was id entified as a risk factor for Campylobacter contamination in broil ers (Refr\u00e9gier-Petton et al. 2001). B\u00fcgener et al. (2014) tested neutral electrolyzed oxidizing water as drinking water for broilers in two farms over three production cycles. The treatment tended to reduce th e within-flock prevalence and significantly reduced Campylobacter load on carcasses of four out of five batches that were positi ve after processing. No further results are available on this intervention and on its a pplicability on farms in France. Probiotics-prebiotics: Aguiar et al. (2013) developed an in vitro screening technique for selecting bacterial isolates with enhanced motility to be used as probiotic culture s preventing Campylobacter colonisation of the broiler gastro-intestinal tract. Potential probiotic bacteria f rom chickens were tested for increased motility and the three bacterial isolates w ith the greatest motility (all Bacillus subtilis ) were tested individually and in combination. The study concluded that probiotic cultures with e nhanced motility achieved significantly reduced colonisation. Various probiotics Bacillus spp, Lactobacillus spp. were tested under in vivo challenge conditions (Ghareeb et al. 2013, Guyard-Nicod\u00e8me et al. 2016, Manes- Lazaro al. Hakkinen 2016, Shrestha et al. 2017). Some of the tested probiotics are already commercially available (Ghareeb et al. 2013, Guyard-Nicod\u00e8me et al. 2016). A wide range of probiotics appeared to be effective for lowering Campylobacter counts in caeca from challenged broilers up to the time of slaughter. Nevertheless, repeatable results were rarely obtained due to the high variability in cecal cou nts observed after treatment. Cean et al. (2015) investigated the use of probiotic strains Lactobacillus paracasei J. R, L. rhamnosus 15b, L. lactis Y, and L. lactis FOa to reduce C. jejuni infection of chicken intestinal cells in vitro , and to decrease colonisation of the chicken gut. Their findings suggest that C. jejuni invasion of chicken primary cells was reduced with the strongest inhibitory effect observed when a co mbination of four strains were administered. In vivo , these four strains prevented mucus colonisation in the duoden um and caecum and the pathogen load in the lumen was significantly reduced. However, the time of administration was important as probiotic application during the early growth period was effective while their use during the last week of growth had no effect. 6.1.2 Potential interventions selected by the working group The interventions that are not relevant to the French situation , and those without quantitative data that could not be used for modelling, were not considered. There is no con vincing evidence that int erventions tested so far to reduce prevalence and/or contamination level are influen ced by the season when expressed in relative risk reduction. Those that could be applicable in France are pr esented below: fly screens: Prevalence decreas ed from 40 to 10 % in Denmark i n one field trial (indoor flocks only), vaccination: 1 to 4 decimal reductions (DRs) in caeca, phage application: 1.3 to 2.8 DRs in caeca, chemical and biological substances added to feed or drinking w ater: 0.7 to 3 DRs in caeca, stop thinning: a decrease of 13% in Campylobacter prevalence at farm is expected (thinning is used for indoor broilers only), slaughter age: slaughtering broiler flocks before 35 days old would reduce the prevalence of Campylobacter by an average 14% This measure co uld be applicable for indoor broilers only. Other interventions for which no quantitative data are availabl e are: ANSES Campylobacter in broilers page 33 / 81 June 2018 Improvement of compliance to biosecurity: several epidemiologi cal studies suggested that improving of compliance to biosecurity would reduce Campylobacter prevalence in broiler flocks. However, no data are available to assess the current state of application o f biosecurity measures in France. In that condition assessing the pot ential impact of this intervent ion is not possible. 6.2 Interventions during tran sport and before slaughtering 6.2.1 List of interventions EFSA (2011) proposed a list of interventions against Campylobacter before and during slaughter and processed operations. 6.2.1.1 Feed withdrawal Feed withdrawal times should be such that, in addition to physi cal emptying, the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract is also maintained. For that, feed withd rawal, transport and holding time before slaughter should be between 8 and 12 hours; the 12-hour limit s hould not be exceeded because it is the maximum feed withdrawal time allowed by the EU regulation for a nimal welfare (EFSA 2011). However, feed withdrawal is not expected to affe c t t h e p r e v a l e n c e o f i n f e c t e d birds, the concentration in caeca or the digestive contents. But a lower quantity of digestive content c ould have a marginal impact on surface contamination after scalding, defeathering, and evisceration (l ess than 5% decrease of the concentration on carcasses) (Pacholewicz et al. 2016). 6.2.1.2 Crates cleaning and disinfection Improvement of crate washing and disinfection procedures should reduce cross-contamination between Campylobacter positive and negative flocks and will decrease the amount of co ntamination introduced in the slaughter facility. A special att ention should be directed to t ransport trucks, crates and cages used for thinning operations. Cleaning and disinfection of crates for broiler transport is ma ndatory after transport, before crate re-use (European Directive 2005/94/EC). T ransport crates are frequentl y contaminated with Campylobacter e v e n after cleaning and disinfection; this contamination could lead to the introduction of Campylobacter into broiler farms during thinning or the external contamination of birds du ring transport to the slaughterhouse (EFSA, 2011). Crate contamination is reported in France as in other Eu ropean countries (Peyrat et al. 2008). Few studies about the impact of cleaning on Campylobacter contamination of crates have been carried out since 2010's. Two studies of (Berrang, Hofacre , et al. 2011, Berrang, Meinersmann , et al. 2011) demonstrated that complete drying of the crates before use is very effective for eliminating residual campylobacter contamination of crates. Howev er, reuse of crates commonly occu rs within the day after their cleaning even if they are not perfectly dry. 6.2.2 Potential interventions selected by the working group The interventions that are not r elevant to the French situation , and those without quantitative data that could not be used for modelling, were not considered. Those that are applicable in France are: Feed withdrawal control: optim izing the starting time of feed withdrawal may have a marginal impact on surface contaminat ion after scalding, defeathering and evisc eration (less than 5% decrease). Another intervention for which no quantitative dat a are availab le is: Improvement of cleaning crates a nd cages before transport (no quantitative data). 6.3 Interventions during slaughter 6.3.1 List of interventions selected by the working group 6.3.1.1 Logistic slaughter It consists in programming the slaughter of non-contaminated ba tches at the beginning of the day to prevent contamination of materials (plu cking fingers, evisceration mach ines). These could also include an increase of expert appraisa l report Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 34 / 81 June 2018 the scalding temperature and (or) freezing carcasses from conta minated lots. In the Fr ench situation, these procedures could be difficult to get in application as long as the information of the food chain does not inform on Campylobacter . Furthermore, the effect would be very small (See \u00a77.1.1 and ( EFSA 2011, Nauta et al. 2009)). 6.3.1.2 Counter current or spray scalding The French Guide to GHP recommends using several successive tan ks to limit cross contamination in particular by Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter sp. , especially because the water temperature used is relatively low (50-60\u00b0C) and con sequently has a limited effect on bacterial cell inactivation. Spray scalding could be an interesting option to avoid cross co ntamination but is not applied due to the energy cost and the water consumption. 6.3.1.3 Plucking process The only intervention could be to clean and disinfect regularly the machines and more sp ecifically the plucker fingers. It would be also importa nt to envisage the frequent ch ange of ageing fingers to avoid the formation of biofilms. 6.3.1.4 Prevention of leaka ge of intestinal content According to EFSA (2011), a better control of the leakage durin g evisceration (batch homogeneity and machineries set-up are critical), can lead to one decimal reduc tion on Campylobacter contamination on carcasses. Nevertheless, this in tervention seems to be difficul t to be applied in the present condition (line speed). 6.3.1.5 Mode of chilling (tempera ture, air velocity, hygrometry ) The improvement of chilling process could be an option to gain one decimal reduction, depending on the prolongation of chilling and va lidation that the lowest counts of Campylobacter did not represent a loss of culturability more than a death of the bacteria (EFSA 2011). Fu rthermore, a recent inve stigation conducted in France showed that optimizing t he main parameters (temperature, d u r a t i o n , a i r v e l o c i t y ) m a y a c h i e v e a maximum reduction of around 1.5 log CFU/g and was very dependen t of the initial Campylobacter contamination: carcasse s presenting more than 103 CFU/g cannot be significantl y decontaminated during the chilling process (Rivoal et al. 2015, 2018). 6.3.1.6 Physical treatment Heat treatment (immersion in hot water or steam) after eviscera tion and before chilling, can decrease the level of surface contamination by 0.2 to 0.5 DR (EFSA 2011). Freezing carcasses for few days or weeks, or crust-freezing, ar e not compatible with the consumer's requirement to have access to fresh product. Reduction of Campylobacter concentration level could reach 0.5 to 2 DRs depending on the dur ation of the treatment (EFSA 2 011). Cooking: efficient as well, is not considered facing the requir ement to have access to fresh products by consumers. 6.3.2 Potential interventions selected by the working group The interventions that are not r elevant to the French situation , and those without quantitative data that could not be used for modelling, are not considered. Those that are a pplicable in France are: Scalding: 0.1 \u00e0 0.2 DR on car cass concentration before chillin g Steaming: 0.2 to 0.4 DR Prevention of leakage of intes tinal contents: 0.9 DR on carcas s. Hot water immersion post eviscer ation: 0.3 to 0.5 DR on carcas s Chilling: <1.5 DRs Different improvements should be considered by sl aughter but co uld not be universally proposed as efforts in hygienic slaughter appear variable and plant specific.

Howev er, this assumes that the outsid e of the package is not contaminated, which is not always the case. Burgess et al. (2005) reported that 3% of the external surfaces of raw chicke n packs were contaminated with bacteria originating from the poultry. T he Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) also detected Campylobacter on 8.9% of the external surfaces of conventional poultry packa ging and on 1.6% of leak-proof packs (FSAI 2010, Meredith et al. 2014) investigated the effect of different modified atmosphere packaging on Campylobacter both immediately and throughout 5 days storage at 2\u00b0C. None of the treatments (10%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% CO 2 balanced with N 2, 80:20% O 2:N2 and 40:30:30% CO 2:O2:N2) achieved a reduced Campylobacter count at any stage throughout the experiment. 6.4.1.2 Antimicrobials Peroxyacetic acid (0.1%) treatment of skin-on chicken breast an d thigh meat resulted in a 1.5 decimal reduction in Campylobacter concentrations in the ground meat product derived from these p oultry pieces (Chen et al. 2014). 0.1% peracetic acid, lactic decreased Campylobacter by 1 log/g on fresh chicken frames that were ground before eva luation of the surviving Campylobacter levels. Meredith et al. (2013) investigated the immediate and storage effects of trisod ium phosphate (TSP,10% and 14%, w/v), (POA, and 200 ppm) and acidified sodium chlorit e (ASC, and 1200 ppm). Dip but not spray treatments were effective. 10% T SP, 14% TSP, 1% CA, and 1200 ppm ASC dip treatments achieved 1.3, 1.5, 0.7, 1.8, 0.7, 1.2, 0.7, 0.7, 0.9 and 1.3 log 10 CFU/cm2 reductions, respectively. In a processing plant, dip treatment of chicken carcasses with 14% TSP and 5% CA achieved 2.3 and 1.4 log 10 CFU/cm2 reductions, respectively. The combination of carvacrol (1%, v/v) and modifi ed atmosphere packaging (95% CO 2:5%O 2) reduced Campylobacter counts on turkey breast cutlets by 1-2 log 10 CFU/g after 3-7 days storage at 4\u00b0C as compared to an untreated control (Nair et al. 2015). Lauric arginate (400 mg/L) gave a maximum reduction of 1 .5 log 10 CFU/g of C. jejuni on chicken breast fillets after 7 days storage at 7\u00b0C. Koolman et al. (2014) inoculated chicken drumsticks with % (w/v) capric acid sodium salt (CP) for 1 min, while ultrasonication w as performed at 40, 60 or 80 kHz. In another experiment the same chemical solutions were administered in seq uential combination (TSP+CA, TSP+CP or CA+CP) while ultrasonication was performed at the same frequenc ies. The sequential treatment of TSP and CP with ultrasonication at 80 kHz achieved a 4.5-4.6 log 10 CFU/cm2 reduction. Lopez et al. (2015) estimated that the use of disinfectant wipes to clean co ntaminated work areas in the kitchen would decrease the risk of human infection by up to 99. 2% using a Monte Carlo simulation. 6.4.1.3 Chilling and freezing Bolton et al. (2014) found that freezing at -20\u00b0C for 7 days decreased Campylobacter by 1.73 log 10 CFU/g and by 3.46 log 10 CFU/g after 42 days of storage. Other similar studies have rep orted 1.0 to 2.7 log 10 CFU/g Campylobacter reductions on chicken breast samples stored at -18\u00b0C for 20 da ys (Eideh et Al-Qadiri 2011), a 0.9 to 3.2 log 10 reduction after 2 weeks storage at -20\u00b0C on naturally contamin ated chicken skin and muscle (Sampers et al. 2010), a 1.3 to 1.8 log 10 CFU/g reduction in C. jejuni on chicken wings frozen at - 20\u00b0C to -30\u00b0C for 72h (Zhao et al. 2003b), and a 2.87 log 10 on broiler carcasses frozen for 31 days (Georgsson et al. 2006). However, freezing will not guarantee the complete elimin ation of all Campylobacter cells on poultry. Sampers et al. (2010) detected viable Campylobacter cells after 60 days of frozen storage. ANSES collective expert appraisa l report Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb in broilers page 36 / 81 June 2018 6.4.1.4 Light Technologies C. jejuni and C. coli on poultry skin exposed to 405 nm light were reduced by 1.7 an d 2.1 decimal reductions, respectively, at the maximal dose of 184-186J/cm2. Yet, exposure times to achieve necessary dose levels might be impractical under p rocessing condition (Gunther et al. 2016). 6.4.1.5 Irradiation Irradiation, whether by cobalt 60 source (gamma ray) or electro n beams is effective against C. jejuni. The range of reported D10 values - D10 is the radiation dose requir ed to eliminate 90% of a bacterial population (one logarithmic cycle reduction) - determined on meat surfaces or in chicken paste, were in the range 0.12 to 0.32 kGy, whether in vacuum or in high oxygen packaging, irr espective of the bacterial cell age, the dose rate of irradiation or the temperature (Dion et al. 1994, Kudra et al. 2012, Lambert et Maxcy 1984, Patterson 1995, Raut et al. 2012). The effect of radurization with a 1 kGy dose was reporte d to provide more than 8 decimal reductions. (Tarj\u00e1n 1985, Yogasundram et al. 1987) reported that 1 kGy completely eliminated cells initially contaminated with 103 CFU/cm\u00b2. Yet, off-odour and sour aroma were observed for irrad iated chicken breast (Raut et al. 2012). One author noted that \"the 3-5 kGy dose generally used f or meat products for the destruction of salmonell ae will also destroy Campylobacter s\" (Tarj\u00e1n 1985). 6.4.1.6 Other The use of ultraviolet irradiation alone was not recommended be cause it is not well accepted by French consumers. Cooking, efficient as well, is not considered facing the requir ement to have access to raw products by consumers 6.4.1.7 At the consumer stage Hygienic practice : broiler carcasses and cuts (fillets and drumsticks) are often contaminated with Campylobacter . However, if stored, handled and prepared properly the inciden ce of campylobacteriosis could be significantly reduced. Thus, hygiene practices are imp ortant in the catering and domestic kitchen (Beumer et Kusumaningrum 2003, de Jong et al. 2008, van Asselt et al. 2008) prevent poultry-borne bacteria from being transferred from the raw meat to other foods, especi ally ready-to-eat (RTE) products, via contaminated hands, equipment and the general kitchen environme nt (Fravalo et al. 2009, Guyard- Nicodeme et al. 2013, Luber et al. 2006, van Asselt et al. 2008, Verhoeff-Bakkenes et al. 2008). Several studies have demonstrated the transfer of bacteria, inc luding Campylobacter , from poultry to hands, oven handles, counter tops, draining boards, knife handles, kni fe blades, dish cloths, fridge handles, microwave handles, microwave bu ttons, press handles, oven handl e, etc. (Bolton et al. 2014, Gorman et al. 2002). Thus cross-contamination during food preparation present s a greater risk of disease than the risk associated with undercooking poultry (Luber et al. 2006). Studies have also shown that washing with warm soapy water is not sufficient to effectively decontaminate kitc hen surfaces and equipment (Barker et al. 2003, Cogan et al. 1999, Cogan et al. 2002, Kusumaningrum et al. 2002, Scott et Bloomfield 1990, 1993, Thormar et Hilmarsson 2010). Consumer compliance to hygienic practice : Altekruse et al. (1999) reported that 19% of respondents in a US survey did not wash their hands or cutting boards properly a fter contact with raw meat or poultry. Frequently washing hands after contact with raw meat was associ ated with a decreased risk of Campylobacter infection (OR: 0.53). Although no data in terms of prevalence or decimal reductions were reported, Maughan et al. (2016) reported that only 40% of c onsumers in the US washed the ir hands properly after handling raw chicken. Moreover, Kosa et al. (2015) found that nearly 70% of consumers washed or rinsed poultry before cooking and only 17.5% stored raw poultry properly in the fridge. Yang et al. (2000) reported that only 51% of US cons umers read a label with cookin g instructions and of these only 37% changed their behaviour. In a related study, Sampers et al. (2012) reported that 11.2% of consumers store raw and cooked poultry on the same plate, 11% did not wash thei r hands after handling raw poultry, 6.7% use the same knife for preparing raw poultry and ready-to-eat f oods, 8.2% used the same cutting board and 16% did not eat well cooked poultry. For France, consumer compliance is described in Annex 5 (Scient ific and technical support note). Effect of public information on hygienic practice : Nauta et al. (2008) tested the effect of a web-based information campaign on hygiene practices by the consumers, mea sured by bacterial cross-contamination during preparation of a chicken meat salad. This effect was inc orporated into a risk assessment for Campylobacter in broiler meat. It was found that there was no measurable eff ect of the information intervention on the risk, unless a behavioural cue, triggering the emotion 'disgust', was embedded within the ANSES collective expert Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 37 / 81 June 2018 instruction for the salad preparation. This research suggests t hat it is unlikely that consumer education by an information campaign will be an e ffective tool for risk mitigat ion. French situation : a recent report on the behaviour of French consumers conclude d that the risk in the domestic kitchen is mainly related to cross contamination via h ands and utensils that are not washed after contact with raw chicken meat, and insufficient cooking (ANSES 2015).The report recommended a multimedia communication campaign targetting the general public . Yet, based on a literature review and surveys of the consumer behaviour , the report concluded that on e cannot expect more than 5 to 10% change in hygiene practices in domestic preparation of chicken meat. According to a QMRA (ANSES 2015), such a change would result in a risk reduction of 1.6 to 3.2%, while an optimum application of hygiene practices would achieve a 4.5 to 9% risk reduction. Overall it was concluded that there are no interventions at the consumer stage that could be immediately applied to control Campylobacter on poultry. 6.4.2 Potential interventions selected by the working group The interventions that are not relevant to the French situation , and those without quantitative data that could not be used for modelling, are not considered (see Annex 3). Th ose that could be applicable in France, with indication of the numerical values selected by the experts are mentioned below: Freezing: 1 to 3.2 DRs Visible light technologies: <2.1 DRs Irradiation: >8 DRs As regards interventions at the consumer phase, the experts int roduced into the model hand washing and utensils cleaning, assuming 100% c ompliance with hygienic pract ice 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 38 / June 2018 7. Modelling 7.1 Existing QMRA models 7.1.1 Published (QMRA) models Campylobacter in broiler meat have been developed worldwide. Nauta et al. (2009) and Nauta and Christensen (2011) presented an overview of some of these models and a more recent overview has been presented by Chapman et al. (2016) (see Figure 7). The reader will refer to these review pa pers for more details on the different published QMRA studies on Campylobacter in broiler meat. Figure 7: Overview of published Campylobacter risk assessments (Chapman et al. 2016) The common objective of these risk assessments is to assess the impact of potential interventions in different steps of the broiler meat production chain in terms o f reduced public health risk for the consumers, as a decision support for risk managers in the government and t he industry. Yet, in general, the models differ in their specific objectives and scope (for example based on th e available data and the interventions to be considered), the consumed chicken meat product and the region o f interest. Also, the modelling approaches differ, partly because the (early) risk assessments were some o f the first food chain risk assessments performed. They were developed i ndependently by research groups with different scientific backgrounds. Roughly, the modelling approaches can by di fferentiated in two types: \"mechanistic\" and \"non-mechanistic\". The \"mechanistic\" models use an MPRM (modular process risk mode lling; (Nauta et al. 2008) or comparable approach, in which the relevant basic process (growth, inactiva tion, cross contamination, partitioning, mixing, etc.) in each step on the production process is identified and a suitable model is used to describe this process, before the data are collected (e.g. Nauta et al. (2005)). The \"non-mechanistic\" models use a data- based approach where statistical (often log-linear) models are derived from the available data (e.g. Rosenquist et al. (2003)). The mechanistic models hav e the challenge that the ava ilable data may be insufficient to feed the models, s o for example expert elicitat ion is needed for paramete risation of the models (Nauta et al. 2005), but their strength is that the non-linear dynamics of tr ansfer and survival of Campylobacter are specifically addressed, whi ch is anticipated to improve th e validity of the estimation of the effects of interventions. For t he \"non-mechanistic\" models, the situation is opposite. They are clearly data ANSES collective expert appraisa l report Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 39 / 81 June 2018 based, but the dynamics may not be modelled correctly. For Campylobacter in the broiler meat production chain, recent research confirms that data alone do not show a c onsistent pattern in terms of changes in concentrations over the different steps of the slaughter proces s (Pacholewicz, Swart , et al. 2015, Seliwiorstow et al. 2015) a pattern that can be well ex plained by the available mec hanistic models. Despite their differences, the published QMRA models show compa rable results in the estimation of the effects of interventions. For example, the different models pre dict comparable effects of the reduction of the concentration of Campylobacter on carcasses, when applied to the same processing step. Figure 8 : Reported risk reductions as a consequence of a reduc tion in concentration on carcasses (EFSA 2011) Some general conclusions that can be drawn from the published Q MRA are (EFSA 2011, Nauta et al. 2009): - In evaluating control strategies, all models suggest a neglig ible effect of logistic slaughter, the separate processing of positive and negativ e flocks to prevent contamina tion of negative flocks. Therefore, there is a proportional relation between the risk (mean probability of dis ease per serving from the product(s) modelled) and the true flock prevalence, i f the distributions of concentr ations remain the same. - All risk assessments conclude that the most effective interve ntion measures aim at reducing the Campylobacter concentration, rather than reducing the prevalence. - During the stage where the co nsumer handles the food, cross-c ontamination is generally considered to be more relevant than undercooking. - The tails of the distributions describing the variability in Campylobacter concentrations between meat products and meals determine t he risks, not the mean values of those distributions. - There is a proportional relation between the risk and the tru e prevalence of contaminated carcasses after slaughter, if the distributions o f concentrations remain the sa me. 7.1.2 Farm models Some epidemiological models (e.g. random-effect logistic models ) can generate estimates of the strength of association between management conditions and likelihood of flo ck colonisation at high levels (Georgiev et al. 2017). The results will indicate how much more likely 'a factor ' contributes to the outcome ( i.e. undesired level of high colonisation) Campylobacter in broilers page 40 / 81 June 2018 A stochastic model could also be employed to reproduce the dyna mics of Campylobacter transmission in broiler flocks and explore the e ffects of several management co nditions and/or on-farm mitigation strategies on the estimated level of contamination of infected flocks at s laughter (Crotta et al. 2017). In this model, the assessment was made by developing an initial baseline probabili stic model aimed at capturing the dynamics of the within flock transmission of Campylobacter in a 'typical broiler chicken flock' and comparing the proportion of highly contaminated flocks obtained under baseline conditions with that obtained wh en different strategies were implemented. The baseline model was implemented with the available information and/or data included in studies related to broiler chicken raised in i ntensive systems in the UK. 7.1.3 Consumer phase models (CPMs) The consumer phase is the last part of the food chain where the actual exposure occurs. It is needed in every QMRA, and the food preparation by the consumer has an imp ortant effect on the exposure, because the meat is expected to be heat treated. Perfect hygienic food handling of the consumer would eliminate Campylobacter , but this is not considered feasible (Nauta et al. 2008). Modelling the consumer phase is challenging, because data are sc arce and difficu lt to obtain, t he variability in food handling practices between (groups of) consumers is large and the effect on transfer and s urvival of Campylobacter i s n o t e a s i l y described. Moreover, the original concentrations of Campylobacter , which will vary from poultry sample to poultry sample, will have a major impact on the specific risk to a given consumer. As reviewed by Chapman et al. (2016) a large variety of CPMs is available. In a comparative a nalysis, (EFSA 2011, Nauta et al. 2012) studied seven different CPMs and their performance in ter ms of the predicted effect of intervention measures before the consumer p hase on the risk estimates. It was found that the relative risk estimates of the different models are often small. A CPM that performs intermediate is based on the data obtained by Nauta et al (2008), which is therefore applied in several other studies, for example the EFSA opinion on Campylobacter control (EFSA 2011, Nauta et al. 2012). In France, a model was developed by Poisson et al. (2015). The figure 9 and annex 4 illustrate the contamination pathways at the consumer stage. Figure 9: Model diagram of the consumer phase (Poisson et al. 2015) (Annex 4). 7.2 The modelling strategy of this working group The primary objective of using a model is to evaluate the effec ts of potential interventions. Therefore, first a \"baseline model\" was developed to assess the \"current risk\", th e mean probability of disease per serving (of a specific chicken meat product), w h i c h w a s u s e d t o e s t i m a t e t h e annual number of campylobacteriosis ANSES Campylobacter in broilers page 41 / 81 June 2018 cases in France by multiplying it with the number of servings o f the modelled chicken products. The effect of the intervention was then expres sed as the percentage of risk r eduction, 100*(1-C int/Cbas), where C bas is the baseline estimated number of cases and C int the estimated number of cas es after intervention(s). Two types of interventions were considered: those affecting the prevalence ( i.e. flock or batch prevalence, or product prevalence) and those a ffecting the distribution of con centrations within a \"set of units\", (for example products within a batch, all products in France, chickens in a farm, etc.) Of the consumed chicken meat in France 70% are produced in France from live animals raised in F rance, and 97 % of them are sold on the French market. The risk assessment only considered chicken meat produced and consumed in France. The reason for this choice is that interventions implemented in the French productio n system will only impact the French products and the consumer s of these products. Also, our focus is on French consumers. The outline of the mode lling strategy is illu strated by the Fig ure 10. Figure 10 : Modelling strategy of this WG No modelling was done for the farm step because the effect of o n farm interventions was directly expressed in terms of reduction of interflo ck prevalence or of decimal re ductions in the concentrations prior to slaughter. Only the interflock prevalence was used. Based on the bibliogra phy, it was assumed that all chickens in an infected flock are infected (100% within-flock prevalence). In this study, we chose to use the slaughterhouse model of (Nau ta et al. 2005, Nauta et al. 2009) the basis for the QMRA. It was chosen because it is a mechanistic model t hat addresses the dynamics in terms of cross-contamination and survival during slaughter, it has been published in the peer reviewed literature and it is readily available. The model was developed for the Nether lands; it was assumed that the industrialized slaughter process is similar in France. For the Consumer phase the WG decided to use the model develope d by Poisson et al. (2015) (Annex 5) because it was based on recently acquired French data. This is a mechanistic model that adresses the dynamics in terms of cros s contamination with Campylobacter by contacting raw chicken directly or indirectly. The different routes of contamination were modeled according to (Pouillot et al. 2012). French specific data resulting from a survey on consumer practices dur ing the preparation of chicken meal that involved 659 French representativ e consumers were used (Poisson et al. 2015). For the dose-response relationship, a dose response model from the literature (Black et al. 1988, Nauta et al. 2007, Teunis et Havelaar 2000). 7.3 Update of the CARMA model with French data The WG agreed on the following va lues (see table 4) for the Fre nch baseline. For the consumer stage, the val ues used are detailed in Annex 5 .

Campylobacter in broilers page 43 / 81 June 2018 Consumption data extruded from t he survey INCA are presented in Table 5. Table 5 : Number of meals per year where chicken fillets and re ady-to-eat foods are prepared at the same time for children (0-17 y ears old) and adults (18-79 years old) Number of meals/year Children 314 000 000 Adults 1 020 000 000 7.4 Scenarios tested The effects of the interventions were described in Section 6. I n the present section, the effects of named or unnamed interventions are tested with the help of the model. So me were chosen because they affect the interflock prevalence of Campylobacter , some because they affect the number of CFU/g. The tested effe cts are listed below. Tested effects at the farm level: A1a and A1b : reduction of the A4 and A5 : 0.5, 1, 1.5 or 2.5 decimal reductions (DR) of Campylobacter concentration in caeca, A6: the combination of reduction of prevalence from 70% to 60% (A 1a) and 0.5 DR of concentration (A2). Tested effects at the slaughterhouse, the CARMA model was used , implemented in @Risk (version 7.5), complemented with a new module for the storage stage (chilling) . The following scenarios were tested: B1: 1 DR during scalding, B2 and B3 : 10% reduction of the probability of leakage during plucking / defeathering or during evisceration, B4: 1 DR on the carcas s during chilling, B5: the combination of 10% reduc tion of probability of leakage at plucking (B2) and 10% reduction of probability of leakage at eviscer ation (B3) and 1DR at chilling (B4). Tested effects at the consumer stage, the model of (Poisson et al. 2015) (Annex 4) was inserted into the model for @Risk. The followin g scenarios were tested: C1a: 100% compliance to the hand washing, C1b: 100% compliance of utensil cleaning recommendations, C2: a combination of 100% complianc e to both these recommendation s. In addition, were tested combinations of interventions with low or high effect among the interventions at the three stages: D1: combination of weak scenarios, D2: combination of strong scenarios. Once a decision is made by the risk manager (RM) regarding the expected level of reduction, the RM will have to select among the potentia l interventions listed in the previous sections. Some effects can be obtained by choosing among the intervention s presented in the previous chapter. The table 6 shows the potential link (provided the reproducibility after field trials is verified in France) between the interventions and the scenarios tested. It should be underlined that all scenarios cannot be linked to a potential intervention due to lack of data in literature, expressed as numbers of decimal reductions or reduc tion of concentration.

It is indicated in the following tables as the Basel ine number of cases. As reported in Section 2.4, the annual number of cases estimated for the consu mption of poultry, based on epidemiological considerations, is 492,705. The similarity of the orders of mag nitude of both numbers tends to show that the values of the variables in the present modelling are not unreal istic. Yet, the Baseline result is obviously over- estimated, as it relates only to the consumption of chicken fil ets produced in France, while the global estimation relates to any kind of food whether of domestic orig in or not. Then, since we aimed at comparing the effect of a variety of in terventions on the risk for the consumer health, we estimated the risk reduction as follows: % 1001 . Therefore, the absolute outcome of the Baseline scenario as est imated in the present model does not influence the risk reduction. While the estimation of the reduction of risk was done consider ing only filets, it i s assumed that the percentage of reduction applies to any part of chicken (with or without skin and whether raised indoor or outdoor) produced and consumed in similar conditions. The risk reduction results presented below provide therefore a global estimate of t he effect of the interventions tested in this modelling exercise. 7.5.1 Interventions at the primary production stage Table 7: Effect of interventions at the farm To obtain more than 50% risk redu ction, the concentration of Campylobacter in caeca should be decreased by 1.5 DRs (that is divided by m ore than 30), or 0.5 DR (divisi on by 3) should be combined with a 10% reduction of the interflock prevalence. Yet, a division of the concentration by 3 only, or a 30% reduction of interflock prevalence would assu re a risk reduct ion of more tha n 40%; which is not insignificant.

The other interventions tested show a risk reduction lower than 5%. 7.5.3 Interventions at the consumer stage Table 9: Effect of interventions at the consumer stage The prevention of cross-contami nation through the cleaning of t he utensils (knife, board, fork, plate) appears to be by far more effective than the washing of hands. 7.5.4 Combinations of interventions Table 10: Effect of combined interventions The combination of the weak scenar ios leads to a risk reduction of 18%. 7.5.5 How could the risk mana ger use this risk assessment? Based on the model results, the risk manager (RM) could decide on the percentage of risk reduction that is aimed at. The RM may notice tha t, in the present situation, it could be more effective to reduce the contamination level than the interflock prevalence. Then, to ac hieve that, the RM could choose among the interventions. It has to be noticed that the esti mated effects of intervention s, as reported in the literature and summarised in the chapter 6 of this report, are associated wi th large vari ability and uncertainty. Re sults are often obtained from a smal set of experimental trials, which may not be repres entative for all chickens, farms, slaughterhouses and kitchens in France where they could be appl ied. . Furthermore, it is difficult to know to what extent the reporte d experimental situations are comparable with the French one. In addition, the French practices are not preci sely known and, in many cases, it is difficult to evaluate for an intervention to what extent it is already in pl ace and what would be its actual effect when applied at the national level. Let assume the RM chooses to intervene at the farm stage and wo uld be interested in testing, for example, vaccination as it could achieve 1 to 4 decimal reductions in th e caeca according to section 6.1.2. To support a decision made by the RM, a long term large experiment would h elp measure the actual reduction of faecal content, animal contamination and carcass contamination.The res ult of that experiment, a survey on the acceptability by the farmers and also by all actors of the food chain including the consummers, an estimation of the future farmer compliance to guidelines, etc. should be combined with those from a cost/benefit analysis (including the benefit of DALY reduction) in actual co nditions.

This issue was outside the remit of the WG. ANSES collective expert Campylobacter in broilers page 47 / 81 June 2018 8. Conclusions 1 / Survey of control measures of Campylobacter in the poultry production, and of their improvement since the report of EFSA (2011) Up-dating of the knowledge on t he contamination of broiler and chicken products: almost no new data have been generated about the situation of Campylobacter in broiler and chicken products in France since the European baselines studies in 2008 and 2009. Various interventi ons at different stages of the food chain production were tested in France, in EU and in the world since 2010's. Yet, results issued from controlled trials in farms or at slaughterhouse are lacking to evaluate th e efficacy and the applicability of those interventions in commercial conditions. Up to now, no single in tervention has been proven to be efficient and applicable enough to be adopted by the professional sector. Impact of consumers' behaviour on the risk: data on the French situation has been obtained. Cross contamination from poultry product to ready-to-eat food is reco gnized as a major source of human campylobacteriosis. Behaviours of consumers in kitchen play an important role on the risk of campylobacteriosis, particularly the practices regarding the cl eaning of utensils. Based on the review of the EFSA (2011) report and of the recent literature, the experts listed the interventions they considered to be applicable in France. They proposed, for each of them, a numerical value of their potential effect on interflock prevalence of carcasses infected by Campylobacter , on the number of decimal reductions (or log kills) that could be achieved by som e interventions at the fa rm, the slaughterhouse or the consumer kitchen. 2 / Modelling of the French poultr y food chain from rearing to consumption The CARMA model, completed in this work with a chilling module and a consumer phase, enabled to estimate the effect of a number of scenarios on the risk of hum an campylobacteriosis compared to a baseline reflecting the situation where no intervention would b e applied. The effect of the scenarios was presented as the reduction of t he relative risk of campylobacte riosis. At the farm, the model, according to its specific hypotheses, showed that the most effective interventions are those that reduce the contamination level on carcasses (CFU/g) rather than reducing the prevalence of contaminated ca rcasses. Therefore, as soon as , for example, vaccination will be available, it might prove quite effective at protecting public health. If, for instance, vaccination would achieve 1.5 decimal reductions o f carcass contamination level, the relative risk redu ction would be 85%. At the slaughter plant, achieving one more decimal reduction o f carcass contamination by scalding or by reducing faeces leakage at t he plucking or evisceration step s would result only in a relative risk reduction of 3% or 4% in the present state of the slaughter cha in technology. By contrast, the chilling process seems to be very effective and, as an example, the mode l shows that one DR of carcass contamination would reduce the risk by 76%. In the home kitchen, hand washing alone has a limited effect o n campylobacteriosis incidence (1% reduction of relative risk). H owever, the cleaning of utensils to prevent cross contamination is effective. If, for example, recommendations on utensil cleaning were effec tively applied by all consumers, the relative risk reduction would be 85%. Perfect application of go od hygienic practice in the home kitchen would be highly effective. However, according to a previous ANS ES report on consumer information (2015) it may be difficult to change consumer behaviour. The experts also tested two scenarios including operations at the farm, at the slaughterhouse and at home. The effect of a combination of interventions is not stric tly cumulative. The scenario with the weakest interventions would achieve a relative risk reduction o f 16% while the one with the strongest interventions would achieve a risk reduction of 99%. 3/ Final consideration The results presented above demonstrate that there is room for improvement of public health protection. However, a major relative risk reduction would need the applica tion of interventions that are presently at the stage of experimentation and development (such as vaccination), improvement of hygienic design of slaughter machinery, as well as better compliance to good hygie nic practices all along the food chain including by the consumers. ANSES collective expert appraisa l report Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 48 / 81 June 2018 9. Recommendations R1 - Establish a national control plan involving all actors of the food chain (as for Salmonella ). As seen in the conclusions, the best improvem ent will result from improvement at each step of the food chain. R2 - A better knowledge of the sources of human campylobacterio sis is needed because this disease is not caused only by broilers from flocks raised in France. Imported chicken and other foods can cause the disease. The results presented above should be understood as re presenting only a limited proportion of cases. R3 - Control measures on farm and during the transport should b e promoted. Field experiments should be conducted to test the effect i ncluding the variability, the app licability and cost of interventions.These control measures should be in relation with the specificity of the Fren ch broiler productions. R4 - At the slaughter plant, good hygienic pratices should be f urther improved and their implementation should be monitored on a regular basis, mainly to avoid carcass contami nation (e.g. leakage) and cross- contamination. R5 - Air chilled parameters (temperature, hygrometry, airflow v elocity) to assure a quick and effective decrease of the carcass temperature should be controlled becaus e the chilling process is a critical point to reduce Campylobacter surface contamination. R6 - Domestic hygiene should be largely promoted including dome stic hygiene training in schools. R7- Further and regular updating of French situation is needed with respect to Campylobacter contamination of broilers and products thereof. R8 - Perform field trials all along the food chain with promisi ng interventions, including new technologies, and estimate their effect on the prevalence and contamination l evels including the variability of the effect and the survival of the bac teria after chilling. R9 - Implement a surveillance sy stem by the competent authority of own-checks on the application of the new microbiological criterion for process hygiene, with the aim of evaluating the impact of interventions and optimizing the quantitative risk assessment.

Chicken meat is considered as one of t he main sources of infection. Dur ing the handling of contaminated chicken eat in domestic kitchen, cross-contamination between raw meat and r eady-to-eat food can occur via hands or utensils. In order to estimate the risk during this preparation in France, a model of the consumer phase was developed. The model was constructed with data from a survey ab out practices of consumers during the reparation of a chicken meal. Moreover, it was tested for diffe rent pieces of chicken (carcass, leg or escalope), for various concentrations and for different scenari o. It appears that, for the different pieces of chicken, the risk reduction increases when the initial concentr ation of Campylobacter decreases. If all consumers wash their utensils and hands with detergent, the ris k reduction is equal to 50% for carcass, 20% for legs and 70% for escalope when we take the highest initial concentration. In the case of nobody cleans, the risk increase of 330% for carcass, 340% for leg and 510% fo r escalope. The next step of this work is to construct the \"farm to fork\" qua ntitative risk assessment model by adding the primary module and the slaughter module to the consumer phase. Keywords : Campylobacter ; chicken; risk assessment; consu mer phase; cross contamination . INTRODUCTION In 2013, Campylobacter continued to be the most commonly reported gastrointestinal bac terial pathogen in the European Union with 214 779 human cases of Campylobacterios is reported (EFSA, 2015). The French notification rate was 39.6 per 100 000 habitants. Raw poultry m eat is often contaminated with Campylobacter since the bacterium can live in the intestines of healthy birds . It is also found in pigs and cattle. Eating undercooking chick en, or ready-to-eat (RTE) food s that have been in contact with raw chicken, is the most common source of infection (Kittl et al., 2013). In order to determine the impact of different control measures on public health risk, a \"farm to fork\" quantitative risk assessment model (QRAM) was developed. This m odel integrates three different modules describing contamination pathway s during: primary production, s laughtering and consumer poultry meat handling. The model was built upon existing models (Nauta et al., 2009) and populated with newly collected French specific data. In instance, for consumer module, we cond ucted a survey on co nsumer practices during the preparation of chick en meal that involved 659 French representative consumers. MATERIALS AND METHODS During the preparation of a chi cken meal, foods prepared in the kitchen can become cross contaminated with Campylobacter by contacting raw chicken direct ly or indirectly. The different ways of contamination were modeled according to Pouillot et al. (2012) consumer phase model. All steps from the raw meat ente ring in the kitchen to the consumption of the meal are described in the figure 1. Initial concentration on raw chicken. The initial concentration of Campylobacter on the raw meat was assessed from DGAl (French dire ctory general for food) study co nducted in 2009. In this study, Campylobacter concentration was measured on different part of chicken (leg, e scalope and carcass) at the stage of distribution. Based on this study, the mean and standa rd deviation of the Campylobacter concentration were estimated fo r the three parts of chicken mea t. Transfer rate . Two routes of transfer from the fresh chicken meat to the mea ls were considered: ready-to- eat food can be directly contaminated by the raw meat by contac t, or RTE and cooked meat can be contaminated via cook's hands or utensils (cross-contamination) . For this latter contamination source, there were contacts between raw meat to RTE or to hands or utensils ( cutting board, knife, fork or dish/plate) and contacts between this different u tensils or hands to RTE or coo ked chicken. ANSES expert 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 75 / 81 June 2018 Estimates of the different transfer rates, needed for the model ling, were directly based on literature (Mylius, 2007) or estimated from published crude data (Fravalo et al., 2009; Luber et al., 2006; Montville, 2003). Use of hands and/or utensils and washing . In order to define the proportion of people who touch the raw chicken or use utensil during a chicken meal, a study was condu cted. An online questionnaire was administered to a representative sample of French population (n =659 persons, carried out at the end of 2012). With this survey, we had defined the habits of handling chicken during the preparation of the meal. We also obtained information about their habits about washing o f hands and utensils (washing with detergent, rinsing or wiping, no washing, put in the dishwasher ). Survival after washing . During the washing step, Campylobacter can survive or not according to the kind of washing (washing with detergent or just wiping or rinsing). The survival rates were taken in the literature (Van Asselt et al., 2008). In the case of no washing , the survival r ate was equa l to 1. Consumption and risk . In order to calculate the risk due to the consumption of a me al contaminated by Campylobacter , we used dose response model from the literature (Black et al., 1988; Nauta et al., 2007). We run the full model considering three different scenarios. Th e first scenario (scenario 0) corresponds to observed data on French consumers habits, the second scenario ( scenario 1) simulates a situation where 100% of people wash with detergent theirs utensils and hands, t he third scenario (scena rio 2) corresponds to a situation in which nobody was hes his/her hands and utensils. We calculated the risk for the different pieces of chicken, starting with the concentration take from the study of DGAl and further we were decreasing the concentration by 0.2log 10 in order to see how the risk is changing if the initial concent ration decreased. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION For the three types of chicken pieces and for the three scenari os, small changes of the initial concentration can lead to significant reduction of the risk (Figure 2). The l ower the initial concentration, more the percentage of risk reduction is near 100%. Also we can see diff erences between the three scenarios. The scenario 1 has the lowest risk compared to the scenario 0. For example, in the case of the carcass, when all the consumers wash with detergent, the risk is 50% lower for a concentration of 1.4log 10 CFU/g than the scenario 0. The scenario 2 has, on the contrary, the highest ri sk compared to the scenario 0. For the escalope, when the initial concentration is equal to 0.1log 10 CFU/g, the risk is 405% higher when no washing (scenario 2).

In the case of legs, for an initial concentration of 1log10 CFU/g, whe n everyone cleans their utensils and hand with detergent, the risk reduction is equal to 45%, w hereas when nob ody cleans the risk increase of 250%. In conclusion, with this model of consumer phase, we determined the impact on the risk of changing the habits of French consumers during the preparation of a chicken meal. The next step of this study, will be to complete this consumer phase with the primary production module and slaughterhouse module in order to obtain a \"farm to fork\" risk assessment model. This QRAM will, at the end, be used to benchmark management scenarios on the final risk. References BLACK R.E., LEVINE M.M., CLEMENTS M.L., HUGHES T.P. and BLASER M.J.

ANSES collective expert in broilers 77 / expert l report Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 78 / 81 June 2018 Annex 5 - Scientific and techni cal support note of the French A gency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & safety relating to \u00ab the updating of kno wledge on the contamination of poultry meat with Campylobacter spp . in order to establish a cost/benefit analysis of control measures at differ ent stages of the food chain in France (2016-SA- 0183) \u00bb The Methodology and Survey Studies Unit (UME) has been solicite d on November 10, 2017 by the Food Risk Assessment Unit (UERALIM) from the Risk Assessment Department ( DER) to achieve a scientific and technical support (AST) relating to statistical analysis of data on chick en and Campylobacter (consumption, handling, campylobacter transfer rate) ( 2017-ASTDER-39 ). The results of this AST will be used in a quantitative risk assessment model for Campylobacter in broiler chicken from farm to fork in order to establish a c ost/benefit analysis of control measures at d ifferent stages of the food ch ain in France ( Request 2016-SA-0183 ). 1. C ONTEXT AND PURPOSE OF THE REQUEST Anses has been solicited on August 16, 2016 by the French Direc torate General for Food (DGAL) to review the most recent data on the contamination by Campylobacter in the poultry meat sector (from farm to fork), the applicable control measures and their effectiveness. The DGAL, also, mandated Anses to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of different control scenarii. In that context UERALI M has asked to UME to provide data that c an be used for modeling of the French food chain from rearing to con sumption. This different data are: Probability of people buying a frozen chicken or freezing it a t home Frequency of chicken cut on the same board as ready-to-eat foo d Hand washing frequency Frequency of board washing Several Campylobacter transfer rates: chicken to hand, chicken to board, hand to sal ad, board to salad Data about the consumption of chicken: consumer rate, frequen cy of consumption for consumers only and serving sizes for consumers only. This data has been provided for di fferent chicken pieces: carca ss, fillet and leg. 2. DATA AND METHOD Several studies and publications have been used to gather the d ifferent data and are presented above. 2.1. Survey in situ about consumer practices during handling of chicken The survey was conducted with t he CREDOC (Research institute fo r the study and monitoring of living standards) in 2012-2013. This survey is declined in two parts: An online questionnaire of a representative sample of French p opulation. The questionnaire included questions about chicken meat preparation habits and knowledge o n bacteria and food safety. People were selected with the quota me thod and 659 persons responded t o the questionnaire. An observation of 30 people at home during the preparation of a meal with chicken, raw vegetables and fruits salad. People were recorded on video during all the preparation and after the meal preparation, they had to respond to the questionnaire about chi cken meat preparation habits and knowledge on bacteria and food safety. The data collected in the first part (the online questionnaire) are used to calculate the parameters below: The probability of people bu ying a frozen chicken ANSES collective expert appraisa l report Saisine \u00ab 2016-SA-0183 \u00bb Campylobacter in broilers page 79 / 81 June 2018 The probability of people freez ing the chicken at home The frequency of chicken cut on t he same board as ready-to-eat food The hand washing frequency afte r handling raw chicken meat (wi th detergent or just rincing them) The cutting board washing frequency after using it with raw ch icken meat (with detergent or just rincing it) All results are provided for th ree types of chicken pieces: car cass, fillet and leg. 2.2. Study of transfer rates of Campylobacter Many studies and experiments have been conducted to estimate th e transfer rate between the raw meat to ready- to-eat food through various surfaces and hands. During these ex periments, the quantity of microorganisms is determined using methods whose result is given as the detection limit. Generally, when the observation is under the detection limits (censored data) it is replaced by the dete ction limit. So in these studies, the estimation of the transfer rate is biased. A work was conducted at ANSES in o rder to take into account the censored data in the estimation of the transfer rate for use in quantitative ri sk assessment model and more spe cifically at the consumer phase (Poisson, 2015). Estimates of the different trans fer rates were directly based o n literature (Mylius, 2007) or estimated from published crude data (Fravalo et al, 2009, Montville, 2013). In order to estimate the several transfer rates a Bayesian model was used with the MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) procedure fro m SAS\u00ae and the censorship was taken into account in the likelihood calculation. 2.3. Third Individual and National Survey on Food Consumption ( INCA3) data The INCA3 survey was conducted between February 2014 and Septem ber 2015, in metropolitan France, among 5855 individuals (2698 children and adolescents from birth to 1 7 years old, and 3157 adults from 18 to 79 years old. The INCA3 survey population is representative of all indiv iduals living in an ordinary household1 in metropolitan France (excluding Corsica). Individuals were selected according to a three-stage (geographi cal units, households and individuals) random sampling method. The geographical units and the households were randomly selected by the National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) from the 2011 national annual population census, taking into account a geographical stratification (regi on, size of the urban area) in order to ensure national representativeness. One individual per household (one adult or one child) was then sele cted from the eligible individuals during the first home visit. Detailed information on the consumption of food and beverages w as collected for three non-consecutive days (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) spread over around three weeks, usi ng the 24h recall method for individuals aged from 15 to 79 years, and the 24h record method ( via a food record) for individuals aged from 0 to 14 years. For th e three selected days, individuals were asked to describe their f ood consumption by identifying all the food and beverages consumed during the day or night. They were asked to describe them in as much detail as possible (brand, cooking method, preservat ion method, sugar/fat/salt con tent, etc.) and quantify them with the help of a book of photographs of food serv ings and household measures. Th e data were collected by telephone by specially- trained interviewers, using standardised software (GloboDiet) d eveloped by the International Agency for Research 1 According to the National Institute for Statistics and Economi c Studies (INSEE), an \"ordinary household\", within the meaning of the census, is defined as all the people who sha re the same primary residence, these people non- necessarily being united by family ties (for example in the cas e of cohabitation or flat-sharing). People living in mobile homes (including seamen and the homeless) or in communal accommodation (workers' hostels, retirement homes, hospitals, detention cent res, boarding schools, universi ty halls of residence or m ilitary barracks, etc.) are considered to be living \"out side ordinary households\". ANSES Campylobacter in broilers 80 / 81 June 2018 on Cancer (IARC) (Slimani et al. 1999, Voss et al. 1998). Individuals aged from 15 to 79 were not informed in advance of the days of the phone calls, unlike the children age d 0-14 who were asked in advance to note their consumption information in a f ood record for a specific day. Under this scientific and technical support, only individuals w ho validated the consumption component by responding to at least two 24 hours recalls/recordings were con sidered, that being 4114 individuals (2121 adults and 1993 children). To ensure the national represent ativeness of the results, the d ata have been adjusted according to a method defined in consultation with INSEE. In particular, a weight was assigned to each individual in the two samples (Children 0-17 and Adults 18-79). Due to sampling constraints, eve ry statistical analysis was con ducted separately fo r children and adults. The several calculations have been achieved for three different types of chicken pieces: Carcass: correspond in the INCA3 nomenclature to the aliment \" whole chicken\" Fillet: correspond in the INCA3 provided for the different ch icken pieces are: Consumers rates Frequency of consumption: estimated from consumers only Portion size: estimated from consumers only. 3.
