To get a prescription for anxiety medication, you must first have an evaluation with a provider, who will assess your anxiety symptoms and determine whether medication can help. If they think it will, they will recommend specific medication(s) to address your particular symptoms. Do I Need Anxiety Meds? Many people experience anxiety from time to time, but some people experience significant worry and fear. If your anxiety is enough to cause you distress and interfere with your life, then you may have an anxiety disorder.1There are many different [types of anxiety disorders](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/anxiety-types/), including [generalized anxiety disorder](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/generalized-anxiety-disorder/), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and [phobias](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/specific-phobias/). A doctor or mental health professional may diagnose you with a specific anxiety disorder after meeting with you and evaluating your symptoms. Common [anxiety symptoms](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/anxiety-symptoms-signs/) include:2 - Excessive worry that is hard to control - Fear of social situations, specific objects, or experiences - Irritability - Poor concentration - Fatigue - Muscle tension - Difficulty sleeping - Feeling restless or on-edge - Panic attacks, which can include heart palpitations, sweating, shortness of breath, and a sense of impending doom - Fear of future panic attacks - Avoidance of people, places, or things that trigger anxiety or panic Your provider may assess your symptoms by asking you questions or having you complete one or more screening tools. If they determine that you do have an anxiety disorder, they can talk to you about different [treatment options](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/anxiety-treatment/). [Medication](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/medication-for-anxiety/) and therapy are two types of clinical treatments that are recommended for anxiety disorders.1 Therapy vs Medication for Anxiety Therapy is typically recommended for all anxiety disorders, but the type of therapy that is most helpful depends on the specific disorder.1 Anxiety that is mild, brief, and does not cause significant problems or distress may be treated with therapy alone.3 However, anxiety that is more severe and affects a person's functioning is better treated with both medication and therapy. The type of medication that is right for you will depend on what kind of anxiety you are experiencing. Antidepressants or [buspirone](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/buspar-buspirone/) are often prescribed for chronic anxiety, while benzodiazepines and beta blockers are usually prescribed for [panic attacks](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/panic-attack/) and acute anxiety.4 How Can I Get Anxiety Medication? In order to take anxiety medication, you need a prescription from a licensed healthcare professional. Depending on the medication, you may be able to meet with a provider through telehealth. Some medications can be safely prescribed this way. Because [benzodiazepines](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/benzodiazepines/) are a controlled substance, they must be prescribed during an in-person visit.5,6 There are some exceptions to this, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. You can ask your provider what meeting formats, either telehealth or in-person, are available. How to Talk to Your Doctor About Anxiety Medication To learn more about whether anxiety medication is right for you, you can start by talking to your doctor or provider about your concerns. Share what symptoms you are experiencing, for how long, and how these symptoms affect your life. It is helpful to be specific. For example, you might explain how you have been dealing with [fear of social situations](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/social-anxiety-disorder/) for the past year, which has led you to [avoid social gatherings](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/avoidance-behavior/). If there are any specific events that [triggered your anxiety](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/anxiety-triggers/), or anything that makes your anxiety worse, then share these points as well. The more information that you give your provider, the better they will be able to help you. It also can be useful to know any details about the mental health and treatments that your biological relatives may have had. Your provider will decide whether anxiety medication is right for you based on your symptoms. Your symptoms will also help them decide what medication is best. Certain anxiety medications target acute anxiety and panic or [panic disorders](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/panic-disorder/), while others are more effective for chronic anxiety. Different medications have different recommended daily doses.3 Your provider will also take into account factors like your biological sex and weight when determining the right dose for you. How to Get Prescribed Anxiety Medication Anxiety medication can be prescribed by a qualified healthcare provider who is trained in medicine and pharmacology. These medications are often prescribed by psychiatrists, but other doctors, like family medicine doctors, internal medicine doctors, and OBGYNs, may also prescribe them. If you already have a healthcare provider, you can ask them if they are able to prescribe you anxiety medication or if they can provide you with a referral. You can usually get a prescription for anxiety medication from the following doctors: - Primary Care Physician (PCP) - Your primary care physician is trained in general medicine and may be able to prescribe you medication for mild anxiety. However, they will likely recommend that you see a psychiatrist if your anxiety is moderate to severe and if you are dealing with other mental health conditions in addition to anxiety, like depression. Sometimes the comfort level of the primary care provider in treating anxiety will determine if a patient is referred elsewhere. - Psychiatrist - Psychiatrists have a medical degree and advanced training in psychiatry. They can prescribe medications and some, but not all, also offer therapy. Many people will see a psychiatrist for medication management and a therapist for therapy. - Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner (NP) - NPs are nurses that have received advanced training in psychiatry. Though they are not medical doctors, they can prescribe medications for anxiety. Some offer therapy as well. - OBGYN - Your OBGYN can also prescribe you anxiety medication if you are dealing with [anxiety related to pregnancy](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/anxiety-while-pregnant/), postpartum, hormonal changes like menopause, or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). - Psychologist - Generally, psychologists only provide talk therapy and conduct psychological assessments. However, there are a few states where psychologists who have received specialized training in psychiatry can also prescribe medication. These states include Iowa, Illinois, Idaho, New Mexico, and Louisiana.7 Can Online Doctors Prescribe Anxiety Medication? Telehealth allows you to connect with your provider virtually. Some providers offer telehealth services for medication visits. These are offered over a secure HIPAA-compliant platform. Some people find telehealth more convenient and have an easier time talking more openly with their doctors about mental health concerns. While telehealth can be a convenient way to meet, online providers cannot prescribe all medications. Because benzodiazepines are a controlled substance, they require that a provider evaluate you in-person, except in certain instances. How to Get a Refill for Anxiety Meds After your first medication appointment, your provider will most likely ask you to return for a follow-up in a few weeks. During your follow-up appointment, they will ask you how you are doing on the medication. If you are doing well, they will provide you with a refill and have you return again in another few weeks. If you are not feeling better on the medication, then they may talk to you about changing your dose or medication. It is important that you attend your follow-up appointments so that your provider can give you refills on time. They will schedule your follow-ups around the time that your medication will run out. If you're not able to attend, you should talk to your provider ahead of time to see if they can send you a refill before your medication runs out.
