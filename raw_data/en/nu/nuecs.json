Energy Medicine entails working with the invisible layers of energy, spirit and quantum fields to take your healing to the next level. Listen to James explain what really forms the basis of energy medicine and how it is needed in this current 'age of Aquarius' and evolving consciousness. Energy Medicine healing is at the heart of our evolution. WHERE DOES THE IDEA OF AN ENERGY MEDICINE ROOM HEALING COME FROM? Medicine rooms first came into our awareness through spiritual teachers such as Tom Brown Jnr and Jamie Sams. We have heard many spiritual cultures (esp Native American Indian culture) talk about energy medicine (healing oneself through energy) and medicine rooms (the container that holds the energy space to heal). These are forms of shamanic training. After working in the energy healing space for over 40 years combined, we have merged the concept of medicine room healing with our years of research and live healing sessions into a process that can assist you to take your healing or coaching work to a new level. Let us guide you to learn true powerful energy medicine healing using quantum energy concepts, shamanic healing and a multitude of other spiritual energy practices.

We have both done reiki healing training several years ago and this deeper, more shamanic healing approach is safer and more powerful in our opinion. It is helpful if you already understand the world of energy healing or quantum energy healing. Quantum energy, quantum healing and quantum healing techniques introduced by Deepak Chopra, M.D., in his book Quantum Healing, where he postulates that these extraordinary forms of healing are related to understandings of quantum physics, quantum energy and of consciousness, and reiki will give you some good starting principles. However, we don't practice calling anything external in and this energy medicine course works directly with the power of your spirit and the person you are healing. We teach you the subtle differences in how to bridge previous energy healing courses into this new powerful medium. Yes, you will be able to practice as an energy healer. Keeping in mind of course everyone is at a different level. We suggest that if you are brand new to the healing field, you might want to have several energy healing practice sessions to grow your skills. Of course, you receive a series of energy healing yourself during the course PLUS you are required to do around 30 energy healing sessions over the 6 weeks on various humans and animals, etc. You will end up with a load of learning experience in spiritual healing, quantum healing, shamanic healing, including doing remote sessions, that will be enough that you can start up your own healing practice. If you are already in the healing field, working as an energy healer, this will definitely amplify the energy healing you already do and up level of spiritual healing skills and gifts. Yes. Apart from teaching you the core skills of an energy healer, these classes naturally and easily open up your intuitive gifts as you practice them and grow their power every time you enter your energy medicine room as an energy healer. We also have a very powerful add-on training module called [Master Your Intuition](https://www.rezinate.com.au/master-your-intuition) if you feel you want to work directly on the intuitive gifts available to you such as clairvoyance, psychic, clairsentience, clairaudience, Clair cognizance and more. Yes. Apart from teaching you the core skills of an energy healer, our energy medicine practitioner training course teaches you several energy healer techniques on how you can detach and remove cords, energy weapons and other people's energy from a client or friend's auric field. You will learn why these cords develop and what you can do in a spiritual healing session to empower your patient and start the healing process. We explore the KEY energy medicine healing technique that we call the \"medicine room\" plus in our classes we teach you over 15 different styles of energy healing tools and techniques, and you get to practice these live and weekly with your classmates. As spiritual healers ourselves, offer in-depth knowledge on spiritual healing, quantum healing, shamanic healing, metaphysical healing in our practitioner training classes. Debbie and James will be mentoring you every step of the way and don't hold any information back in their classes, they want you to succeed as an energy healer. Absolutely! Apart from teaching you the core skills of an energy healer, we also teach you skills so you can work remotely as a spiritual healer. In fact, we think it is the MOST POWERFUL form of distance or remote healing you can do. We offer our knowledge on quantum energy and shamanic energy, as part of the background before we give you the tricks on how to create a time/space virtual energy container that can be practiced from anywhere in the world. We also teach you how to do a remote healing session effectively using a 3-step approach that will give your healing sessions as an energy healer next level brilliance. Yes. As we teach you to be an energy healer and the steps to set up the energy medicine room, you can pop yourself or any loved ones into the healing container and really help transform and heal others. This is a must do course if you're wanting to be a spiritual healer. It is not solely a shamanic course, but it does highlight and uses shamanic energy along with quantum energy knowledge to apply and use on family, friends and self. Yes. This energy healing practitioner training gives you the skills of a spiritual healer and works with the world of shamanic energy and principles, we can utilise it to heal animals, plants and land - alongside humans of course! With shamanic healing, everything is alive, and everything has a spirit so you can perform spiritual healing on all types of live beings. Reiki energy healing is a style of energy medicine healing and bases its principles on working with the invisible field or blueprint of the human body. Energy medicine room training does the same except we teach you how to build a powerful healing container in the invisible or metaphysical world that is both safe and supercharged with your powerful natural gifts as a spiritual healer. This course explores quantum energy, shamanic energy and will advance your skills as an energy healer. As spiritual healers ourselves, we layer our 40 years combined experience into the training and teach you the advanced and tested (after 27,000 sessions) methodology that we use to get real results as fast as possible. The medicine room healer training really is the collective wisdom of James and Debbie Pask and is unique to anything else available on the market. Just ask the several clients over 30 countries around the world who have experienced a healing session with spiritual healers Debbie or James. [](javascript:void(0)) IS THIS ENERGY MEDICINE COURSE SAFE AND WILL IT KEEP ME PROTECTED FROM ANY INVADING SPIRITS OR FORCES? IS THIS ENERGY MEDICINE COURSE SAFE AND WILL IT KEEP ME PROTECTED FROM ANY INVADING SPIRITS OR FORCES? Yes. Unlike some healing practices, we ensure your energy healing room or space is clean and clear and only works with the power of your spirit and not outside influencing forces. With understandings from shamanic training and shamanic energy, we do not call anything in for protection as we understand the shamanic healing laws about free will and all of the training, we offer will educate you about how to stay powerful and clear during your energy healing sessions. Yes, our healing courses are similar to reiki energy healing or any other type of spiritual healing course, the energy medicine training uses the power of the source field (also called dreamweave, dreamtime, matrix, or quantum field) to create change at the energy blueprint level and make lasting change to the lives of clients. Where the energy medicine room classes differ is that we firstly build you a container to hold the healing power and secondly layer in all of the advanced techniques required to deliver a world-class energy healing session that will blow you out of the water and heighten your skills as an energy healer. [](javascript:void(0)) DO I NEED ANY OTHER TYPE OF SPIRITUAL HEALING TRAINING PRE-REQUISITES BEFORE I CAN START THIS ENERGY MEDICINE TRAINING? DO I NEED ANY OTHER TYPE OF SPIRITUAL HEALING TRAINING PRE-REQUISITES BEFORE I CAN START THIS ENERGY MEDICINE TRAINING? No, you don't need perquisites to master our healing courses and classes to become a spiritual healer. However, like anything in life, the more training and background knowledge you have in spiritual healing - the faster you will leap. Reading spiritual healing books about concepts of shamanic healing and the quantum energy fields and dreamweave will embed concepts and ideas that will activate nicely once you start our training. Many people have dabbled in other energy or spiritual healing training before they start these classes. This includes modalities like reiki energy healing, theta healing, shamanic healing training, kinesiology and more. Contact Debbie and James to discuss more about what you can expect from our energy medicine healing training. Yes - Yes this is a form of shamanic training as it bases its roots in shamanic healing and the shamanic ideology that everyone and everything is energy and that we are ONE with nature and the creator's blueprint. We deal with the shamanic energy and shamanic training ideas of dark and light and that true healing comes back to having a connected relationship to the great mystery and nature herself.
