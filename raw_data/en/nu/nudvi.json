Where Does Chiropractic Stem From? Cheir (hand) and praktos (done) are two Greek words that were combined to form the word \"chiropractic\" or \"done by hand.\" Daniel David Palmer, the founder of [chiropractic medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic), selected that particular term as his favorite. During a chiropractic adjustment in 1895, D.D. Palmer treated Harvey Lillard, who was largely deaf at the time. Harvey Lillard later stated that his hearing had improved as a result of the adjustment. Two years later, D.D.
