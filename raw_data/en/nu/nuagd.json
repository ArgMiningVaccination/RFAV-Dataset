Table of Contents Purpose of Vamana Vamana treatment is targeted to expel increased Kapha Dosha out of the body. When Kapha dosha gets increased, it causes certain types of diseases - such as cold, cough etc. If the extent of Kapha increase is less, then some oral medicines can be given to suppress it.

His umbilical region and back should be massaged in upward direction. The physician should very carefully observe the vomit in the spittoon, ascertain the number of urges and should conclude therapy as to whether the therapy has been well administered, inadequately administered or administered in excess.

If bouts are insufficient, they should be induced again and again by drinking water boiled with long pepper,Amla, mustard and rock salt. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms indicating the proper action of the drug: The first effect of the administration of decoction would be perspiration which indicates that the Dosha has started melting.

Heenayoga - Minimum bouts - 4 bouts Madhyama vega - Moderate - 6 bouts Atiyoga - Maximum bouts - 8 bouts Vomiting should be allowed till the appearance- coming out of Pitta. This is appreciated by expulsion of bile or yellow sticky material, at the end. Coming out of Pitta indicates complete expulsion of Kapha Dosha. Ayoga - inadequate bouts - Non - commencement of bouts, bouts coming on with hindrance or elimination of the medicine only- are the features of inadequate bouts; from it arise, excess of expectoration, itching, appearance of skin rashes, fever etc. Signs of proper Vamana Signs of proper administration of Vamana therapy: Manifestation of the vomiting urges in time Absence of too much pain Elimination of Doshas in proper order.

If that also fails, then the patient is made to follow Samsarjana krama (see below), and again within a few days, a quick Vamana therapy is planned. Over administration of Vamana Over-emesis may cause the diseases of the head and neck due to the vitiation of Vata and disturbance of speech.

Made to undergo [herbal smoking](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2013/08/13/herbal-smoking-benefits-rules-side-effects-blends-to-try/) He should then enter into a room which is not exposed to the wind and should lie down there. Activities to avoid The patient should abstain from the following for the whole day - Speaking aloud, Excess eating, Sitting at one place for long time, Walking long distances, Anger and grief, Exposure to sun, dew and stormy wind, Travelling, Indulging in sexual intercourse, Waking up at night, avoiding sleep [sleeping during day time](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2011/02/21/day-sleep-sleeping-in-the-day-good-or-bad-ayurveda-details/), foods with opposite qualities, [wrong food combinations](https://www.easyayurveda.com/2013/03/14/bad-food-combinations-and-solution-as-per-ayurveda/) and Foods that may cause indigestion, Intake of diet exclusively having one taste, intake of diet deficient in nutritive value, or heavy or irregularly mixed up Suppression or forcible initiation of natural urges. Diet regimen after Vamana Diet regimen after Vamana treatment It is also called as Samsarjana Krama. Soon after emesis, the digestive capacity of the patient is very low. Hence, all of a sudden regular diet cannot be introduced. In stead, liquid diet should be started and gradually turning to solids. In the same evening or the next day after Vamana, patient should take bath in lukewarm water. He should be given like- warm gruel (Manda) prepared with well cooked old rice. The gruel should be very thin. This is to be given with due regard to the power of digestion, for three meal-times. For the fourth meal- time, gruel prepared with rice (Vilepi), well-cooked, warm and devoid of oil / ghee and salt altogether or with oil / ghee and salt in small quantity is to be given. Warm water is to be taken after the intake of gruel. The same type of diet is to be continued for the fifth and sixth meal-times. For the seventh meal-time again, well-cooked porridge (odana) prepared with the same type of rice of two Prasruta along with a very thin green gram soup (Mudga yusha), added with oil / ghee and salt in small quantity is to be given. Warm water should be taken after the intake of the porridge. The same diet is to be repeated for the eight and ninth meal-times. For the tenth meal-time, thin meat-soup (Mamsarasa) prepared with water and salt should be given. Warm water is to be taken after this. This is again to be repeated for the eleventh and twelfth meal times. Thereafter, the patient should take food having different tastes and he should start taking his normal diet from the seventh night. Another method of Samsarjana Persons who have had the maximum, medium and minimum purificatory therapies, should consume Peya- thin Gruel, Vilepi- thick Gruel, Akruta Yusa- soup not processed with fat, salt, sours etc. Krutayusa- Soup processed with fat, salt and Sours and Rasa- meat juice- in Successive order, for three, two and one Annakala- time of meal respectively. Note: Eating periods = Anna Kala. Each day has two anna kala. - morning and evening. If the maximum vomiting bouts were observed (Ati Yoga), Then, the patient should take Peya, Vilepi, Akruta Yusha, Kruta Yusha and Mamsarasa - three eating periods (Annakala) each. The patient will not have any food except these. Likewise, for the medium vomiting bouts, the number of eating periods Is two each and for lesser bouts (Heena Yoga), the number of eating periods (Anna kala) is one each. Benefits of Samsarjana Karma Just as a spark of fire after being fed by grass, powder of dry cow dung etc, gets augmented gradually and becomes great, steady, and capable of burning everything, similarly, the internal digestion fire, by the Samsarjana regimen, in the patient who has undergone Vamana karma, gains strength. So, this is how Vamana treatment is administered in patients. Vamana therapy for a normal person: It is a must for people with Kapha body type, to undergo Vamana treatment occasionally. Even for other people, Kapha Dosha gets naturally aggravated during spring season. At that time, Vamana is recommended as part of spring cleansing to (Ay) & Dr Manasa, B.A.M.S Therapeutic emesis is a part of Panchakarma purification therapies. It is meant to expel morbid kapha or kapha predominant doshas from the body. But it is said that emesis therapy should be given until the pitta is eliminated in the vomit material. If emesis is the best remedy for kapha and if we are administering it to expel excess kapha in the body or to treat kapha predominant diseases, why should we look for pitta to be expelled? Pittanta means ending with pitta. Pittanta vamana means emesis until pitta is seen in the vomitus. When pitta is seen in the vomited material emesis therapy should be stopped immediately. Therefore the sight of pitta is a sign of completion of emesis therapy successfully. It is also an indication to the physician that no more emesis should be given. Does absence of Pita (bile) coming out necessarily means improper completion of Vamana? Not seeing Pitta at the end of Vamana procedure, need not mean the completion of Vamana. Other signs such as number of bouts of vomiting, quantity of vomitus etc. should also be considered. Regional anatomy of the doshas Kapha is located in the upper portion of the body, above the navel. Pitta is located below kapha region, around the navel region. Vata is located at the bottom tier, below pitta zone and below the navel. We need to remember that these doshas are located everywhere in the body and the mentioned anatomical regions are their regions of predominance. Amashaya is said to be the seat of both kapha and pitta. Amashaya means stomach. If we do not take this in literary meaning we can consider kapha to be predominantly present in the stomach and pitta in the lower portion of stomach i.e. the upper part of the intestines. When emesis is administered the exited kapha predominant doshas are thrown upwards due to the effect of the medicine and is expelled through the mouth. Once the kapha has been totally expelled, the pitta located in the intestine below is pulled upwards due to the suction effect of emetic medicine. When pitta is seen the emesis is said to be completed and kapha is said to be expelled in totality. The physician should observe carefully for the sight of pitta towards the end of emesis. Read - How to know that pitta is coming upwards at the end of emesis? In therapeutic emesis kapha, pitta and vata are eliminated in that order. Only when they are eliminated in this order it will be considered as signs of properly done emesis therapy. Only sight of pitta is desired in emesis but not complete expulsion of pitta. Similarly the appearance of vata at the end of emesis is just explained for purpose of understanding the chronology of expulsion of doshas but is not desired as an event. If pitta is expelled in excess or vata appears at the end of emesis or when emesis is not stopped at the sight of pitta complications of the therapy will arise. Pitta will be seen as greenish bilious material in the emesis. The patient would experience bitterness, the taste of pitta in his mouth. A sort of burning discomfort may be felt in the chest, throat and mouth due to the pitta moving upwards. Is expulsion of pitta the ultimate sign of comprehensive emesis? Emesis is said to be comprehensive and fruitful if pitta is seen at the end of the emesis. Along with this the number of bouts and quantity of emesis should be in accordance to the type of emesis administered i.e. major cleansing, moderate cleansing or minor cleansing. Also signs of proper emesis should be present.

Is the regular practice of kunjal kriya a way to control kapha and pitta doshas? by Dr JV Hebbar: Context: There is a vomit inducing detoxification procedure in Ayurveda, called Vamana. This is done for Kapha disorders such as obesity, chronic respiratory disorders, etc. Procedure is - high dose fat intake for few days (internal oleation) Oil massage - for a day Sweating treatment Then medicine is given to induce vomiting with licorice, sweet flag, Randia spinosa etc. There is a Yogic practice called Kunjala Kriya, where salt water is consumed in huge quantities and vomiting is induced. The questioner is asking, in the traditional Vamana procedure, can the vomiting medicines be replaced with Kunjala kriya after internal and external oleation therapy? Simple answer is no. Here are the following reasons - a. If it was allowed, Charaka, Sushruta etc. masters would have mentioned about this, as they were knowing about Ayurvedic procedures. b. It is not a good idea to mix Ayurvedic therapies with Yoga ones and vice versa. The purpose of therapy, mechanism of action of medicine used, etc. completely differ in these two great sciences of heatlhcare. c. In the Vamana procedure, the vomiting medicines are given specifically to liquefy the toxins from the sites of pathology and to expel them through oral route. Just saline water might not do this laborious work efficiently.
