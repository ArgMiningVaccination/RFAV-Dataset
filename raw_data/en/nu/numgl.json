From pharmacological treatments to support groups, the availability of evidence-based treatment and recovery support for locals continues to increase. Still, social workers may find that detox centers in New Jersey are also utilizing nontraditional, less mainstream methods of fighting addiction. So, in this blog, we will address: - What are these treatments? - Why is there a paradigm shift toward nontraditional treatment? - How can social workers navigate nontraditional treatment options with their clients? - What is complementary and alternative medicine? Nontraditional methods of addiction treatment\u2014including meditation, yoga, acupuncture, and progressive relaxation\u2014are often lumped together under the title of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). CAM includes a wide array of medical practices and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine. However, while CAM is frequently used to treat physical ailments, it is being used more commonly in addiction therapy. - Why the paradigm shift toward CAM?So, the shift toward CAM has increased with public familiarity, as many practitioners see CAM gain traction in our own backyard with clients, healthcare providers, and detox rehab centers in New Jersey. More than 38% of adults and nearly 12% of children nationwide use some form of CAM, according to [research](https://nccih.nih.gov/news/camstats/costs/costdatafs.htm)from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. CAM treatment can be used to enhance other evidence-based practices. - How can social workers navigate CAM treatment options with their patients?Social workers whose clients express interest in CAM may wonder about the effectiveness of CAM for addiction recovery. While the majority of addiction studies focus on pharmaceutical, psychosocial, and cognitive-behavioral treatments, some research shows promising results for CAM. Specifically, one [study](http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/112309p8.shtml)treated individuals with dual-diagnoses by using acupuncture as part of a treatment program. Compared with the control group, the patients reported significant improvement in concentration, sleep, energy, and pain management. [Another study](http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/112309p8.shtml)analyzing acupuncture applied the treatment to opiate withdrawal. The patients who received acupuncture experienced a reduced rate of withdrawal symptoms. Also, a reduced need for withdrawal medications such as methadone. CAM is unfamiliar to many and may elicit skepticism. However, it is valuable to remember that a client's step toward addiction recovery is worth celebrating. Curiosity is a step toward recovery, notes [Dr. David Spiegel](http://www.socialworktoday.com/archive/112309p8.shtml), medical director at the Stanford Center for Integrative Medicine - Stanford University. \"It's evidence of our patient's effort to get better,\" he explains. \"It's a sign that they are mobilizing themselves to get better.\" Social workers should welcome clients' curiosity about CAM and connect them to additional information they need for a full course of treatment. Connecting Patients with detox Rehab Centers in New Jersey Social workers are in the position to explain to their clients that evidence-based treatments used in conjunction with CAM therapies offer better outcomes for successful recovery.
