Application, Merit Criteria, Section 1: Application Ability to Operate a Business 1 Applicant - Delta 11 Hawai'i Inc. Application, Merit Criteria, Section 2: Plan for Dispensary Delta 11 Hawai'i inc. is a registered Hawai'i C Corp, it will consist of 4 business units as follows: i) Medical Cannabis Cultivation Center We will be implementing a growth model based on projected demand to roll out of our Cultivation Centers. Initially the demand will be relatively small however demand will increase rapidly, and even more so once qualified visitors are able to get their med ical cannabis in Hawai'i. The Delta 11 Hawai'i Inc. Cultivation team consists of experienced Medical Cannabis cultivators that are experts in the Delta 11 Inc. methodology and cultivation system which has been developed and implemented by our CEO in Calif ornia. Current scientific research shows that regenerative growing practices also contribute to carbon sequestration by natural processes of photosynthetic removal and retention of atmospheric CO2 in soil organic matter. This contrasts to typical marijuan a growing operations that don' t build soil organic matter over time, but throw away large quantities of soil after each growing cycle, while hydroponic operations compound this waste, often losing up to 40% of the irrigation water through a \"run-to-waste \" method. Our regenerative practices are a contrast to this typical waste by sequestering carbon and emphasizing the use and production of local inputs and amendments and continual reuse and building of our soil. Simple practices like companion planting with food herbs creates a living mulch (saving water), increases soil fertility and soil microorganism activity, and strengthens plant immunity reducing pest challenges. Although the environmental, social, and human health benefits of the methods we use are significant, they are rarely fully incorporated into marijuana productions because the initial growing expenses are higher with these practices. But, we believe the environmental and community benefits warrant this investment. We are able to control enviro nmental factors to maintain ecologically friendly cultivation centers. Our team utilizes standards of practice that ensure consistent cultivation of medical grade cannabis. 2 Applicant - Delta 11 Hawai'i Inc. Application, Merit Criteria, Section 2: Plan for Dispensary Our unique cultivation system ensures the highest quality while leading the indust ry safety standards by using chemical free and pesticide free horticultural practices. ii) Medical Cannabis Production & Quality Assurance Center The Production & Quality Assurance Product team consists of experts in manufacturing and design of Delta 11 Hawai'i Inc. medical cannabis based products. A wide variety of medical cannabis based products will be available to medical patients to better suit their individual medical needs as allowed under Hawai 'i Act 241. For example, those with arthritis pain can use a topical that helps reduce pain and swelling. For people who do not want to smoke cannabis we provide alternatives such as capsules that can be taken instead or tinctures that can be taken orally in the form of drops. For seizures we create a CBD rich product that has very little psychotropic effect but amazing effects for people with seizures and Migraines. iii) Two Medical Cannabis Retail Storefronts Offering safe and comfortable environments for qualified Medical Cannabis patients to access high grade medical cannabis products that are safety tested in an independent, Certified HPLC lab for contaminants, molds and mildews and for potency, our products will always be Chemical and Pesticide Free. Storefronts will have all security measure needed to provide safety for customers as well as staff. Please see business plan for security plan for Dispensary storefronts. We will be banking several times each day via secured transport, to ensure no excess cash is ever on site at dispensaries (this is possible regardless of federal banking restrictions) please review business plan for details. Education and recommendations for people who are not familiar with medical cannabis and the best forms of the medicine based on their ailments. We will always have a Medical Cannabis Expert on 3 Applicant - Delta 11 Hawai'i Inc. Application, Merit Criteria, Section 2: Plan for Dispensary hand at each storefront who will be able to assist people. We will also make learning materials available to all of our qualified medical cannabis patients.

Gov. James Kealoha Estate, as managed under the Miulan P.Y. Kealoha Trust, under advisement of Kuulei Kealoha Cooper, Trustee. Our Mea 'Ai Sustainability Program is a community benefit program designed to fund land reconstitution projects for native and edible forests, community and school gardens, Hawai'ian fishponds and the creation of other relevant local food sources. Dr. Jana Bogs, author of Beyond Organic, is the Head of the Mea 'Ai Sustainability Program, and will provide educational opportunities and guided oversight of best practices in healthy and beyond organic food. The Kealoha Estate 's Pelekumu Lagoon Project, in partnership with the County of Hawai'i, is a perfect start to our community funding initiatives in Puna. Together we will reconstitute the land that was previously farmed for papayas and create a local community farm that will produce healthy fresh fruits and vegetables for local community residents at a very reasonable rate. Community members and educational groups will have the opportunity to grow healthy food while learning best practices from experts in farming and cultural cultivation practitioners. During the recent lava threats it became increasingly clear that Puna need a viable and sustainable local food source. The 4 Applicant - Delta 11 Hawai'i Inc.

B) Producing and maintaining a supply of marijuana that is sufficient to meet the needs of qualify- ing patients: De lta 11 Hawai'i Inc. will be using a proven method of continual harvest cultivation, this allows for weekly production cycles and ensures that if we have a crop issue it will be isolated to just a week worth of inventory. We will use nitrogen packaging sealing machines to safely store a backup inven- tory sufficient to cover 4 months work of a grow production cycle from a grow unit. This will en- sure that even if multiple grow units have issues we will never run low on inventor y.

We utilize patient petitions and feedback forms to present and gather information that are valuable to our medical patients. Delta 11 Inc. recently asked our current members in California to submit letters of recommendation to show our customer satisfactio n, within the last month or so we have collected hundreds upon hundreds of letters of letters of support and have attached a pdf document with all letters from cur- rent members. We will be using BioTrackTHC which will enable us to collect, store, and retrie ve all data and activ- ity. All inventory records, patient records, recall reports, sales/transaction records, product disposal records, and all scanned documents can be accessed at any time (real time), either in-system or through the report creation tool. This will allow us to help our patients find the most effective med- icines for their ailments and create customer recommendations to maximize the medicinal benefits. 1 Ability to comply with criminal background check requirements pursuant to this chapter and sections 329D -7, 329D -12, and 846- 2.7, HRS; All directors, employees, subcontractors, and anyone otherwise associated with Delta 11 Hawaii inc. shall comply with fingerprinted background checks prior to hiring or access of our facilities. All pote ntial employees will be screen and evaluated as guided by the hiring processes included in our employee hand- book. The applicant and applying entity members have already fulfilled the fingerprinted background check requirements. 2 1 Applicant - Delta 11 Hawai 'i Inc. Application, Merit Criteria, Section 7: Inventory Tracking, Security, and Sales Limits Ability to comply with the requirements in this chapter and chapters 329 and 329D, HRS, for in- ventory tracking, security, and sales limits for qualifying patients; SUBCHAPTER 5 TRACK- ING REQUIREMENTS\u00a711 -850-61 Tracking requirements. a) A dispensary licensee shall track electronically the dispensary's inventory of marijuana and manufactured marijuana products through each stage of processing, from propagation to point of sale, disposal, or destruction, and maintain a record of clear and unbroken chain of custody at all stages, including during transport of the inventory between dispensary facilities and between a dispensary facility and a laboratory. Delta 11 Hawai'i inc has contracted with BioTrackTHC maintain inventory tracking patient con- trol system s. The BioTrackTHC system is comprised of several components; all of which are de- signed to seamlessly integrate with one another. Recognized as the industry leader in seed -to-sale tracking, the BioTrackTHC producer, processor and retail tracking components are completely interoperable with one another. Whether the tracking requirements include plants, trimmings, waste, conversion, dispensing or anything in between; the BioTrackTHC system, in concert with its unique inventory typing system, can currently track anything the industry allows by law. The BioTrackTHC System issues a globally unique, non- repeating 16-digit identification number to each plant. At every stage in the product lifecycle where something needs to be differentiated, the System issues a new \"child\" identifier (e.g., separating flower from stems during the harvest process, separating edible batches that are going to different dispensaries, the creation of new clones or seeds from a mother plant, etc...). The System issues the identifier to prevent accidental or intentional identifier duplication by the user, and the 16-digit identifier ensure scalability and longevity \u2014the System could generate 1,000,000 identification numbers per second and it would not run out of unique identifiers for over 317 years. 2 Applicant - Delta 11 Hawai 'i Inc. Application, Merit Criteria, Section 7: Inventory Tracking, Security, and Sales Limits Every identifier is associated with a quantity that is measured in either discrete units or a weight depending on the item' s classification; for example, plants, seeds, and infused edibles are meas- ured in discrete units, whereas, bulk flower and stems are measured in continuous weight. This creates an unbroken audit chain. Select any identification number and both the State and the reg- istered organization can backwards -trace the medical cannabis product 's lineage all the way back to the plant from which it came, and also forwards -trace every gram to where it is still in inven- tory, where it has been dispensed, to whom it was dispensed, and where it was destroyed. As an example, if 100 grams were harvested from plant 98765: in this case, 2 grams were con- sumed by the testing laboratory, 8 grams were dispensed to patient Smith, 15 grams were dis- pensed to patient Jones, 55 grams are still in inventory, and 20 grams have been destroyed. La- boratory testing is built -in and tied directly into the inventory typing system. This allows for very complex or very simple rules on what needs to be tested, what the testing requirements are, the pass/fail limits, etc. This testing paradigm provides a model for ensuring that only properly tested product may be sold to a patient. The system 's integrated features can be setup to prevent the sale or transfer of product that has not passed state mandated laboratory tests, if necessary. 3 Applicant - Delta 11 Hawai 'i Inc.

Application, Merit Criteria, Section 11: Disposal of Marijuana and Manufactured Products A plan for secure disposal or destruction of marijuana and manufactured marijuana products; Cannabis Waste Disposal Recycling Options During or after a Harvest or Cure, a user would create a batch for the \"green waste\" which would include broad leaf trim, and stems that weren 't going to be converted into a concentrated format. All waste would be weighed, given it's own 16-digit barcode, which is permanently stored in the system prior to it being destroyed. When a BioTrackTHC user sends a sample for Qu ality Assur- ance testing and the sample does not meet minimum standards, a user may; 1) Place the product into quarantine for destruction, or, 2) Convert the product into a different format. If the user converts the non- conforming sample and originating lot, the new converted product must be retested. Processed cannabis waste may contain trace amounts of THC post extraction. We have con- tracted with two local companies to handle the waste management process, Pacific BioChar and Island Herbs. The following are proposed disposal options: 2 Applicant - Delta 11 Hawai 'i Inc.

Application, Merit Criteria, Section 12: Ability to Ensure Product Safety For seizures we create a CBD rich product that has very little psychotropic effect but amazing effects for people with seizures and Migraines. Qual ity in production starts with safe and consistent growing methods. Delta 1 Hawai'i inc. growing methods: A) Maximize environmental protection - our regenerative and vegan methods ensure: Zero water waste through patent -pending irrigation techniques that eliminate evapo -trans- portation losses and eliminate run-off. Minimize water use per above. No other commercial grow has incorporated our state -of- the art irrigation techniques. Typical hydro operations waste up to 40% of irrigation wa- ter and often create wastewater or runoff with nutrients and pesticides that can burden wastewater treatment systems or contribute to algal blooms and eutrophication in water bodies. Zero runoff per above Re-use and building of soil and soil health. Most grow operations throw their soil away after one cycle of growing, which is extractive, not sustainable, and increases energy con- sumption. Healthy soil and plants, minimizing the need for organic pest controls. Safe, organic, food based proven pest controls used only if needed No contamination - vegan grown on-site fertilizers are food grade and if spilled won 't harm people, plants, or animals. Local sourcing of amendments and microorganisms that reduces carbon footprint and maximizes benefit to local economy compared to importing, upon which most grow oper- ations rely. 3 Applicant - Delta 11 Hawai 'i Inc. Application, Merit Criteria, Section 12: Ability to Ensure Product Safety B) Ensure Patient Safety and Product Quality - Chemical and pesticide free, nutrition grown, regenerative practices guarantee: No crop/food safety handling concerns - vegan farming eliminates all crop food- safety handling concerns that are present with synthetic or animal by-product fertilizers. No synthetic fertilizers - all locally, sourced food grade inputs. No toxic pesticides or herbicides or poisons - all controls are food grade. Soil and plant health and medicine quality maximized through nutrition grown methods. Healthy soil and plants also reduce the need for organic pest controls. All products will be tested for potency and safety with a locally contracted HPLC certified lab in Kona. We will te st for molds and mildews as well as potency testing to ensure product is safe for consumption. Delta 11 Hawai'i inc has contracted with BioTrackTHC to maintain inventory tracking and pa- tient control. After a testing laboratory has entered sample test results into the System, the licen- see retrieves the testing laboratory results and the System applies those results to the original lot from which the sample came. Only if the inventory item has a status of \"Passed QA\" can it be placed on a manifest. A regist ered organization user cannot, under any circumstance, place an item on transportation manifest if that item requires testing and does not have a \"Passed QA\" sta- tus (e.g. not yet tested or failed testing). BioTrackTHC automatically syncs testing data upon receipt from a certified testing location. Testing will ensure the product is free of contaminants with consistent THC and/or CBD levels. 4 Applicant - Delta 11 Hawai 'i Inc. Application, Merit Criteria, Section 12: Ability to Ensure Product Safety Furthermore, every plant interaction is recorded, including but certainly not limited to what addi- tives are used and when, allowing cultivators to replicate results or make applicable changes to increase plant quality and consistency. BioTrackTHC syncs testing data to the applicable plant batch or barcode for easy display and retrieval. To simplify the process that inform ation can be directly ported onto the associated product labels. All aspects of the marijuana plants, byproduct wastes, weights, ID numbers and associated data is stored in the system indefinitely. Destruction event information and explanations are also doc- umented and stored within the BioTrackTHC system. This data cannot be modified or deleted by the cultivation center employees or even by BioTrackTHC. BioTrackTHC records manual inventory adjustments through a detailed notes section. The rea- son for disposal and, if applicable, disposal company are recorded and archived to the 16 digit barcode associated with the disposed cannabis. As with all transactions in the BioTrackTHC sys- tem, the employee responsible for the transaction is required to enter a PIN number or biometric fingerprint recording the date, time, and reason for the transaction. All medical cannabis and manufactured medical cannabis products shall be secured in a locked room in 1600 lb safes bolted to the ground at our production facility . All Cannabis produced will remain under constant live high definition video surveillance with a 30 day online backup of video recordings.
