UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET April 23 FO R DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIE F _______ TO THE HONORABLE REED O'CONNOR: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \"Affordable Care Act,\" \"the ACA\" or \" the Act\"), as recently amended, forces an unconstitutional and ir- rational regime onto the States and their citizens. Be- cause this recent amendment renders legally impossible the Supreme Court 's prior savings con- struction of the Affordable Care Act's core provision\u2014 the individual mandate \u2014the Court should hold that the ACA is unlawful and enjoin its operation. NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519 (2012), held that in enacting the ACA, Congress sought to do something unconstitutional: impose a mandate to obtain health insurance by requiring that most Americans \"shall \" insure that they are \"covered [wrongly] thought it could enact such a command un- der the Commerce Clause[.] \" NFIB , 567 U.S. at 562 30 (Roberts, C.J.). The Supreme Court, however, inter- preted the mandate to be part-and-parcel of a tax pen- alty that applies to many (but not all) of those to whom the mandate applies. Thus, even though Congress sought to do something unconstitutional in enacting the mandate under the Commerce Clause, the Su- preme Court salvaged its handiwork as a lawful exer- cise of the taxing power. But things changed on December 22, 2017. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This new leg- islation eliminated the tax penalty of the ACA, with- out eliminating the mandate itself. What remains, then, is the individual mandate, without any accom- panying exercise of C ongress 's taxing power, which the Supreme Court already held that Congress has no authority to enact. Not only is the individual mandate now unlawful, but this core provision is not severable from the rest of the ACA\u2014as four Justices of the Su- preme Court already concluded. In fact, Congress stated in the legislative text that the ACA does not function without the individual mandate. The ACA's unconstitutionality follows from three holdings in NFIB and the aforementioned provision in th e Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. First, a majority of the Supreme Court held that Congress lacks the con- stitutional authority to compel citizens to purchase health insurance. NFIB , 567 U.S. at 558 (Roberts, C.J.); id. at 657 (Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., dissenting) (hereinafter \" Dissenting Op.\"). Sec- ond, the same majority concluded that the ACA in- cluded a mandate to buy health insurance that applies to most (but not all) citizens, and a separate tax pen- alty that applies to most (but not all) of those required to buy insurance under the mandate. Id. at 562- 63 31 (Roberts, C.J.); id. at 663 (Dissenting Op.). Third, a different majority held that, as a matter of constitu- tional avoidance, it was \"fairly possible \" to reinterpret the mandate and tax penalty as a single \"tax,\" which Congress may enact under its taxing authority. Id. at 564- 74. In reaching this end, the majority concluded that Congress's taxing -power interpretation was only \"fairly possible \" because the provision at issue raised \"at least some revenue for the Government. \" Id. at 564 (citing United States v. Kahriger , 345 U.S. 22 (1953)). Indeed, the raising of \"at least some revenue\" was \"the essential feature of any tax.\" Id. (emphasis added). Af- ter all, if a provision raises no revenue, it cannot be said \"to pay the Debts and provide for the common De- fence and general Welfare of the United States. \" U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1 (emphasis added). Pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, starting in 2019, the tax penalty is eliminated by re- ducing the tax to zero. Pub. L. No. 115-97, \u00a7 11081, 131 Stat. 2054. The individual mandate itself, however, re- mains. But be cause the tax penalty provision in the ACA no longer raises any revenue, the Supreme Court 's avoidance reading is no longer possible. As the Congressional Budget Office explained, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 \" eliminate[s] \" the \"individual mandate penalty . . . but [not] the mandate itself .\" Con- gressional Budget Office, Repealing the Individual Health Insurance Mandate: An Updated Estimate 1, (November 2017) (emphasis added) (hereinafter \" CBO 2017 Report\" ).1 Because the tax penalty raises $0, it lacks \"the essential feature of any tax,\" and avoid- 1 See https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th -congress -2017-2018 /reports/53300-individualmandate.pdf. 32 ance interpretation adopted in NFIB to save the indi- vidual mandate from its unconstitutionality is no longer \" fairly possible. \" Following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the country is left with an individual man- date to buy health insurance that lacks any constitu- tional basis. The invalidity of the ACA's core provision (individual mandate) thus follows from NFIB . Once the heart of the ACA\u2014the individual man- date\u2014is declared unconstitutional, the remainder of the ACA must also fall. NFIB , 567 U.S. at 691- 708 (Dissenting Op.). As Congress made clear, \"[t]he re- quirement [for individuals to buy health insurance] is essential to creating effective health insurance mar- kets. \" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(I) (emphasis added). \"[T]he absence of th[is] requirement would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance market. \" Id. \u00a7 18091(2)(H). In particular, \"the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements would not work without the coverage requirement [i.e., Section 5000A]. \" King v. Burwell , 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2487 (2015) (emphasis added). So because the remainder of ACA does not \" function in a manner consistent with the in- tent of Congress, \" the whole Act must fall with th e mandate. Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock , 480 U.S. 678, 684- 85 (1987) (describing severability analysis) (em- phasis added). Absent the individual mandate, the ACA is an ir- rational regulatory regime governing an essential market. The ACA's stated objectives are \"achiev[ing] id. \u00a7 18091(2)(F), and \"creating effective health insurance markets, \" id. \u00a7 18091(2)(I). But with- out the \"essential \" mandate, coverage will decrease, 33 premiums will rise, and markets will become irra- tional. See id. Thus, the post-mandate ACA lacks \"some in the \"realities \" of the health -insur- ance market, Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 321 (1993), and has no \"plausible policy reason\" for forcing contin- ued compliance, Armour v. City of Indianapolis , 566 U.S. 673, 681 (2012). In all, the ACA is unlawful and the Court should enjoin its operation. There fore, Plaintiffs seek declar- atory and injunctive relief against the United States of America, United States Department of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, in his official capacity as Secretary of Health and Human Services, United States Internal Reven ue Service, and David J. Kaut- ter, in his official capacity as Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue, regarding Defendants ' actions im- plementing and enforcing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. I. PARTIES 1. Plaintiff States are all sovereigns within the United States. 2. Plaintiff Paul LePage is the Governor of Maine and Chief Executive of the Maine Constitution and the laws enacted by the Maine Legislature. Me. Const. art. V, Pt. 1, \u00a7 1. 3. Plaintiff Phil Bryant is the Governor of Mis- sissipp i and brings th is suit on behalf of Mississippi pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 7-1- 33. 4. Plaintiff Neill Hurley is a citizen and resident of Texas and a citizen of the United States. Mr. Hurley maintains minimum essential health insurance cover- age, which he purchased on the ACA- created ex- change. Mr. Hurley is subject to the individual 34 mandate and objects to being required by federal law to comply with it. 5. Plaintiff John Nantz is a citizen and resident of the State of Texas and a citizen of the United States. Mr. Nantz maintains minimum essential health in- surance coverage, which he purchased on the ACA- created exchange. Mr. Nantz is subject to the individ- ual mandate and objects to being required by federal law to comply with it. 6. In addition to performin g various sovereign functions and prerogatives, all Plaintiff States func- tion as significant employers with tens of millions un- der their collective charge.2 7. Defendants are the United States of America, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\"Department\" ), Alex Azar, in his official ca- pacity as Secretary of Health and Human Services, the United States Internal Revenue Service (\"Service \"), and David J. Kautter, in his official capacity as Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 8. The Department is a federal agency and is re- sponsible for administration and enforcement of the laws challenged here. See generally 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 3508; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 202-03, 3501. 9. The Service is a bureau of the Department of Treasury, under th e direction of the Acting Commis- sioner of Internal Revenue, David J. Kautter, and is responsible for collecting taxes, administering the In- ternal Revenue Code, and overseeing various aspects 2 See, e.g. , U.S. Census Bureau, State and Local Government Em- ployment and Payroll Data: March 2015 Annual Survey of Public Employment & Payroll, http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/ table/1.0/en/ GEP/2015/00A4. 35 of the Act. See et. Any injunctive relief requested herein must be imposed upon the Department, Secretary, Service, and the Acting Commissioner for Plaintiffs to obtain full relief. II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 11. The Cour t has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 because this suit concerns the constitu- tionality of the ACA. The Court also has jurisdiction to compel the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue to per- form their duties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. 12. The Plaintiffs ' claims for declaratory and in- junctive relief are authorized by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 2202, by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 Rules 57 and 65 of the Fed- eral Rules of Civil Procedure, and by the general legal and equitable powers of the Court. 13. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391 be- cause the United States, two of its agencies, and two of its officers in their official capacity are Defendants; and a substantial part of the events giving rise to the Plaintiffs ' claims occurred in this District. Further, a plaintiff \"resides\" in th is district, a \"substantial part of the events [ ] giving rise to the claim occurred \" in this district, and \"no real property is involved.\" Id. \u00a7 1391(e)(1). 36 III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND A. The Individual Mandate and the Afforda- ble Care Act. 14. In 2010, Congress enacted a sweeping new regulatory framework for the nation 's healthcare sys- tem by passing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-152, 124 Stat. 1029, collectively and commonly referred to as the \"Affordable Care Act.\" See Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119-1025 (Mar. 23, 2010) (here- inafter, collectively, Affordable Care Act,\" \"the ACA\" the Act\"). President Obama signed the Pa- tient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590, 111th Cong.) into law on March 23, 2010, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliati on Act (H.R. 4872, 111th Cong.) into law on March 30, 2010. 15. The ACA has the express statutory goals of \"achiev[ing] id. \u00a7 18091(2)(F), and \"creating effective health insurance markets, \" id. \u00a7 18091(2)(I). 16. The ACA contains three main features rele- vant to th is lawsuit. 17. First, the ACA contains an \"individual man- date\" on most Americans to purchase health insurance and, separately, a tax pena lty for most who fail to com- ply. ACA \u00a7 1501; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A. a. The statutory title of the individual man- date is \"Requirement To Maintain U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(a), and the statutory title 37 for the tax penalty is \"Shar ed Responsibil- ity Payment, \" ACA \u00a7 applicable . . ensure that the individual . . . un- der minimum essential coverage.\" 5000A(a). Responsibility Payment\"\u2014im- posed a tax \"penalty \" on individuals who failed to comply with Subsection (a): \"If a taxpayer who is an applicable individual . . . fails to meet the . . then . . . there is hereby imposed on the taxpayer a penalty with respect to such failure[ ].\" 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(b)(1). Subsec- tion (c) determines the amount of the tax penalty with a multi -step formula. Id. \u00a7 5000A(c). c. Some Americans are exempt from the indi- see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(d)(2) -(4); id. \u00a7 1402(g)(1), while others are subject to the mandate but ex- empt from the tax penalty, see 26 a mandate, even in the absence of penalties, becau se they believe in abi ding by the nation 's laws. \" Congres- sional Budget Office, Key Issues in Analyz- ing Major Health Insurance Proposals 53 (Dec. 2008).3 3 See https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/110th -congress -2007 -2008/reports/12-18-keyissues.pdf. 38 18. Second, the ACA imposes regulations on health -insurance companies. a. The Act requires health insur ance compa- nies to \"accept every employer and individ- ual in the State that applies for [ ] coverage,\" regardless of preexisting b. The Act prohibits insurance companies from charging individuals higher premiums because of their health (commonly termed \"community rating \"). ACA \u00a7 1201; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 c. The Act imposes numerous coverage re- quirements on all health -insurance plans, termed \"essential health benefits \" in the Act, and limitations on \"cost-sharing \" on all plans. See ACA \u00a7\u00a7 1301- 02; U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18021- 22. d. The Act charges \"the Secretary \" with the authority to \"define the essential health benefits\" that plans must include. 1302; 42 U.S.C. 18022. Such benefits \" at least \"ambulatory patient services, \" \"emergency services, \" \"hospitali- zation, \" \"maternity and newborn care, \" \"mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treat- ment, \" \"prescription drugs, \" \"rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices, \" \"la- boratory services, \" \"p reventive and well- ness services and chronic disease management, \" and \"pediatric services, in- cluding oral and vision care. altered). 19. Third, the ACA contains other regulations to promote access to health insurance and the affordabil- ity of that insurance. a. Employers of 50 or more full-time employ- ees (defined as working \"on average at least 30 hours [ ] per week,\" \u00a7 1513; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H(c)(4)(A)) health insurance if one employee quali- fies for a subsidy to purchase health insurance on the health -insurance ex- changes created by the ACA. See ACA \u00a7 1513; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H. b. Covered employers that fail to offer any in- surance must pay a penalty of $2,000 per year ACA \u00a7 1513; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H(a), (c)(1). If the employer fails to offer affordable insurance, then it must pay $3,000 per year per employee. ACA \u00a7 8544, 8544 (Feb. 12, 2014). c. The Act also authorizes refundable tax credits to make insurance purchased on the exchanges more affordable for individuals between 100% and 400% of the poverty line. See ACA \u00a7 1401; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 36B. d. The Act substantially expanded Medicaid, requiring States to cover\u2014with an e x- panded benefits package \u2014all individuals under 65 who have income below 133% of the poverty line. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396; see gen- erally NFIB , 567 U.S. at 574- 80 (Roberts, C.J.) (describing expansion and holding 40 that forcing States to comply is unconstitu- tional). e. The Act also imposes additional insurance taxes and regulations, like a tax on high cost employer-sponsored health coverage, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980I, a requirement that in- surance providers cover dependents up to 26 years of age, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg -14(a), the elimination of coverage limits, id. \u00a7 300gg - 11, and a reduction in federal reimburse- ment rates to hospitals, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww. f. Finally, the Act contains a grab bag of other provisions. For example, the Act imposes a 2.3% tax on certain medical devices, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4191(a), creates mechanisms for the Secretary to issue compliance waivers to States attempting to reduce costs through otherwise-prohibited means, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1315, and regulates the display of nutritional content at certain restaurants, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(q)(5)(H). 20. According to Congress's own findings, the ACA's provisions do not function rationally without the individual mandate. a. Congress stressed the importanc e of Sec- tion 5000A 's individual mandate with ex- plicit findings in the text of the ACA itself. ACA \u00a7 1501; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091. b. among legislative findings is Section 18091(a)(2)(I), which provides: U nder sections 2704 and 2705 of the Public Service Act [42 U.S.C. 41 300gg -3, 300gg -4] (as added by sec- tion 1201 of this Act), if there were no requirement [to buy health insur- ance], many individuals would wait to purchase health insurance until they needed care. By significantly increas- ing health insurance coverage, the re- quirement [to buy health insurance], together with the other provisions of this Act, will minimize this adverse selection and broaden the health in- surance risk pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health insuranc e premiums. The require- ment is essential to creating effective health insurance markets in which improved health insurance products that are guaranteed issue and do not exclude coverage of pre-existing condi- tions can be sold. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(a)(2)(G) (em phasis added). Even after the recent legislative change, the individual mandate remains part of the ACA, permitting the ACA to function exactly as Congress outlined and intended. c. Other legislative findings from Section 18091 reinforce this point. i. \"By significantly reducing the number of the uninsured, the requirement, to- gether with the other provisions of th[e] [ACA], [health care's] 18091(2)I. \"[B]y significantly reducing number 42 of the uninsured, the requirement, to- gether with the other provisions of th[e] [ACA], will lower health insurance pre- miums. \" Id. \u00a7 18091(2)(F). ii. \"The requirement is an part of [the Government' s] regulation of eco- nomic activity, and the absence of the re- quirement would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance mar- ket.\" Id. \u00a7 18091(2)(H) (emphasis added). iii. \"[T]he requirement, together with the other provisions of th[e] [ACA], will sig- nificantly reduce administrative costs and lower health insurance premiums. The requirement is essential to creating effective health insurance markets that do not require underwriting and elimi- nate its associated administrative costs. \" Id. \u00a7 18091(2)(J) (emphasis added). d. The Supreme Court explained that the ACA's provis ions are \"closely intertwined, \" such that \" the guaranteed issue and com- munity rating requirements would not work without the coverage requirement [i.e., Section 5000A]. \" King , 135 S. Ct. at 2487 (emphasis added); NFIB , 567 U.S. at 547- 48 (Roberts, C.J). e. Upsetting this balance \"would destabilize the individual insurance market\" in the manner \"Congress designed the Act to avoid.\" King , 135 S. Ct. at 2493. 43 B. The Individual Mandate and the Tax Pen- alty Are Inextricably Intertwined \u2014One Cannot Exist Without the Other under NFIB v. Sebelius . 21. In NFIB v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519 (2012), the constitutionality of the ACA was challenged by most of the Plaintiff States herein. 22. As relevant here, the States argued that Sec- tion 5000A \"exceeded Congress's powers under Article I of the Constitution. \" Id. at 540 (Roberts, C.J.). Spe- cifically, the States argued that: (1) the Commerce Clause did not support the individual mandate; (2) Congress's tax power did not support the mandate; and (3) if Section 5000A is unconstit utional, the Court must enjoin the entire ACA because it is non-severa- ble. See id. at 538-43 (Roberts, C.J.). 23. A majority of the Supreme Court held (via the opinion of the Chief Justice and the four- Justice dis- senting opinion) that the individual mandat e exceeded Congress's power under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause. Id. at 558-61 (Roberts, C.J.); id. at 657 (Dissenting Op.). 24. A different majority (via the opinion of the Chief Justice and the four-Justice concurring opinion) then held it wa s \"fairly possible \" to read the individual mandate plus its tax penalty as a single, unified tax provision, and thus could be supported under Con- gress 's tax power. Id. at 563 (Roberts, C.J.). 25. Under this alternate tax interpretation, Sec- tion 5000A is no longer \"a legal command to buy insur- ance \" backed up by a threat of paying a penalty that is applicable to some, but not all, of those to whom the 44 mandate applies; \"[r]ather, it makes going without in- surance just another thing the Government taxes, like buying gasoline or earning income.\" Id. (Roberts, C.J.). 26. \"The essential feature \" of the Court 's alterna- tive tax holding is that the tax penalty \"produces at least some revenue for the Government.\" Id. at 564 (Roberts, C.J.) (citing Kahriger, 345 U.S. at 28 n.4) (emphasis added). \"Indeed, the payment is expected to raise about $4 billion per year by 2017. \" Id. (Roberts, C.J.). Absent that \" essential feature,\" the Court 's al- ternative interpretation was not \" fairly possible \" un- der both the Cons titution 's text and longstanding Supreme Court precedent. 27. The NFIB dissent rejected this alternate read- ing. The dissent explained that Section 5000A is \"a mandate that individuals maintain minimum essen- tial coverage, [which is] enforced by a penalty .\" Id. at 662 (Dissenting Op.) (emphasis added). It is \"a man- date to which a penalty is attached, \" not \"a simple tax.\" Id. at 665 (Dissenting Op.). 28. The dissent explained that the structure of Section 5000A supported the mandate -attached -to-a- penalty -that- sometimes -applies reading: Section 5000A mandates that individuals bu y insurance in Subsection (a), and then in Subsection (b) it imposes the penalty for failure to comply with Subsection (a). Id. at 663 (Dissenting Op.). Section 5000A exempts \"some \" people from the mandate, but not the penalty \u2014 \"those with religious objections,\" who \"participate in a health care sharing ministry, \" and \"those who are not lawfully present in the United States. \" Id. at 665 (Dis- senting Op.) (citations omitted). ob- tain health insurance, exempting anyone from the 45 mandate provision, but not the penalty provision, \"would make no sense. \" Id. (Dissenting Op.). 29. The Chief Justice agreed with the dissent 's pri- mary conclusion (thereby creating a majority) that the \"most straightforward reading of\" Section 5000A \"is that it commands individuals to purchase insurance. \" Id. at 562 (Roberts, C.J.). \"Congress thought it could enact such a command under the Commerce Clau se, and the Government primarily defended the law on that basis. \" Id. (Roberts, C.J.). The \"most natural in- terpretation of the mandate \" is that it is a command backed up by a penalty, not a tax. Id. at 563 (Roberts, C.J.). C. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 Re- pealed The Tax Penalty, Leaving Only the Unconstitutional Individual Mandate. 30. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Among many other provisions, the new law amended Section 5000A. Pub. L. No. 115-97, \u00a7 11081. 31. This amendment reduces the operative parts of Section 5000A(c) 's tax penalty formula to \"Zero per- cent\" and \"$0.\" Pub. L. No. 115-97, \u00a7 11081. This change applies after December 31, 20 18. Id. After the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Section 5000A(a) still contains the individual mandate, requiring \"[a]n ap- plicable individual\" to \"ensure that the individual . . . is covered under minimum essential coverage, \" but Section 5000A(b) 's tax \"penalty \" for an individual who \"fails to meet th[is] requi rement\" is now $0. 32. The House Conference Report of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 agreed. \"Under the [ACA], indi- viduals must be covered by a health plan that provides at least minimum essential coverage or be subject to a 46 tax (also referred to as a penalty) for failure to main- tain the coverage (commonly referred to as the 'indi- vidual mandate ').\" H.R. Rep. No. 115-466, at 323 (2017).4 \"The Senate amendment reduces the amount of the individual responsibility payment, enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, to zero.\" Id. at 324. The Conference Report is silent about the individual mandate itself. 33. The CBO 's report on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 explains that the bill \" eliminate[s] \" the \"in- dividual mandate The CBO added that \"a small number of people who enroll in insurance be- cause of the mandate under current law would con- tinue to do so [post elimination of the individual mandate 's penalty] solely because of a willingness to compl y with the law.\" Id. 34. In the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Con- gress did not amend or repeal the ACA's legislative findings that the individual mandate is essential to the operation of the ACA. 35. As the Supreme Court explained in NFIB , \"the essential feature of an y tax\" is that it \"produces some revenue.\" 567 U.S. at 564 (emphasis added). 36. Section 5000A, as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, now \" produces \" no revenue (be- ginning Jan. 1, 2019). Accordingly, it is not possible to interpret the individual mandate as part of a single unified tax provision. 37. Instead, the \"most natural interpretation of the mandate, \" id. at 563 (Roberts, C.J.), is now the 4 See https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/C RPT-115hrpt466/pdf/ CRPT -115hrpt466.pdf. 47 only interpretation possible: an unconstitutional com- mand from the federal government to individuals to purchase a product. D. The ACA, As Amended, Imposes Serious Injury and Irreparable Harm Upon the States and Their Citizens. 38. As Congress itself found, the ACA's provisions only work rationally with the individual mandate \u2014a mandate now unconstitutional under NFIB . 39. The unconstitutional individual mandate, along with the ACA itself, significantly harms and im- pacts the States, as independent sovereigns, in vari- ous ways: a. Imposing a burdensome and unsustainable panoply of regulations on a market that each State has the sovereign responsibility to regulate and maintain within its own borders, to wit: i. The ACA imposes a health insurance ex- change in each State for consumers to shop for health plans and access subsi- dies to help pay for coverage. Under the ACA, States can choose between three types of exchanges: 1. State -based exchange (adopted by 16 States, plus the District of Colum- bia), including five federally- sup- ported exchanges, which rely on the Healthcare.gov technology platform; 2. State-partnership with a federally facilitated exchange (adopted by six States), or 48 3. Federally- facilitated exchange (adopted by 28 States). Defendant HHS established and imposed the exchange infrastructure on the States and certifies at the federal level t hat participating health plans meet the federal requirements to sell plans on the exchange. The ACA does not grant States statutory authority to enforce the ACA and HHS main- tains the authority to take enforce- ment action. For States involved in the federally- facilitated exchange, carriers must file plans with both the state regulatory authority and CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services), even if they do not plan to participate in the exchange. Whether they are sold on or off the federal Marketplace , all individual and small group health insurance plans must include the essential health benefits package and comply with other federal requirements. ii. The ACA also imposed myriad market reforms on the States, including guaran- teed issue, prohibition on preexisting condition exclusions, and modified com- munity ratings. b. By forcing state, non-federal governmental officials and citizens to comply with the mandates of the ACA, including the indi- vidual mandate, and all of the ACA's asso- ciated rules and regul ations, instead of 49 state -based policy regarding health insur- ance, Plaintiffs are injured. Sovereigns suf- fer injury when their duly enacted laws or policies are enjoined or impeded. See Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico, 458 U.S. 592, 601 (1982) (recognizing the inter- est of a sovereign in its \"power to create and enforce a legal code, both civil and crimi- nal\"); Alaska v. U.S. Dep't of Transp. , 868 F.2d 441, 443 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (agreeing that the State has standing to seek declar- atory and injunc tive relief \" because DOT claims that its rules preempt state con- sumer protection statutes, [and therefore] the States have suffered injury to their sov- ereign power to enforce state law\"); Mary- land v. King , 133 S. Ct. 1, 3 (2012) (citing New Motor Vehicle B d. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 434 U.S. 1345, 1351 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers) (\"It also seems to me that any time a State is enjoined by a court from ef- fectuating statutes enacted by representa- tives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury. \")); Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott , 734 F.3d 406, 419 (5th C ir. 2013) (\"When a statute is enjoined, the State nec- essarily suffers the irreparable harm of denying the public interest in the enforce- ment of its laws. \"); Coalition for Hinson , 122 F.3d 370, 372 (7th Cir. 1997) (State has standing where it \"complains that a federal regulation will preempt one of the state 's laws. \"). 50 c. The unconstitutional individual mandate, along with the ACA itself, significantly harms and impacts the States by compel- ling them to take corrective action, at great cost, to save their insurance markets, to wit: i. On January 21, 2018, Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin called on the Legis- lature to pass \"a state -based reinsur- ance program \" for individuals purchasing insurance on the ACA's ex- changes, which will \"stabilize[ ]\" the market after \"insurers exit[ ] [and] shock rate increases. \" Governor Scott Walker , Press Release, Governor Walker Proposes Health Care Stability Plan to Stabilize Premiums for Wiscon- sinites on Obamacare (Jan. 21, 2018).5 This proposal would cost $200 million, split between State and federal funds. Governor Scott Walker, Memo Accompa- nying Jan. 21, 2018 Press Release.6 The Wisconsin Legislature passed The Wis- consin Legislature passed a reinsurance program in February 2018.7 Wisconsin 's reinsurance program is necessary be- 5 Wisconsin State Legislature, Senate Bill 770, https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2017/proposals/reg/sen/bill/ sb770. 51 cause the ACA's regulations of the indi- vidual market causes health -insurance premiums to rise substantially. Without Wisconsin 's intervention, plans in the individual market would either not be offered, or would be prohibitively expen- sive. ii. Wisconsin 's Insurance Commissioner, like the insurance commissioners of all State s, will need to take other corrective actions to protect Wisconsin citizens from the ACA's irrational regime. iii. While the Texas Legislature did not adopt most ACA requirements into Texas law, the Texas Department of In- surance (\"TDI\") monitors the impact of the ACA on the Texas insurance market and takes action, when warranted, to protect consumers and minimize market disruptions. For example, TDI devel- oped navigator rules to address insuffi- cient for navigators, 28 TAC \u00a7\u00a7 19.4001- 19.4017 , and the ACA- forced dissolution of the Texas Health Insurance Pool caused insurance coverage disruptions given the difficul- ties with the federal health exchange rollout, requiring TDI to issue an emer- gency rule extending existing insurance coverage for Texas Health Insurance Pool enrollees. iv. Moreover, like other States, many health insurers have withdrawn from Texas due to unsustainable rising costs. Some federally designated regions of 52 Texas have only one insurance carrier offering healthcare plans. Texas resi- dents and employers, including Texas it- self as an employer, suffer as a result of this lack of choice and higher costs. v. Likewise, the ACA has wrought havoc on the health insurance market in Ne- braska. In 2017, two insurers exited Ne- braska's indiv idual market, leaving only a single insurer remaining. Aetna an- nounced its withdrawal from Ne- braska's individual market in May 2017, citing an expected loss of $200 million for 2017 in the four states Aetna sold in- dividual coverage. In June 2017, Blue Cros s and Blue Shield of Nebraska also announced its withdrawal from Ne- braska's individual market, citing an ex- pected loss of $12 million for 2017, in addition to the approximately $150 mil- lion loss the company experienced in Ne- braska from 2014 to 2016. In the wake of these companies' departures, only a single insurer, Medica, is left in Ne- braska's individual market. Nebraskans are left to hope Medica \u2014which itself raised premiums in plan year 2017 by an average of nearly 31 percent \u2014re- mains in the market for 2019. vi. In Missouri, the Interim Committee on Stabilizing Missouri 's H ealth Insurance Markets, a bi-partisan committee of the Missouri House, was formed to work on solving the rising instability plaguing 53 the Missouri insurance markets as a re- sult of the ACA. The committee voted unanimously to create the \"Missouri Re- insurance Plan, \" and legislation to es- tablish the Missouri Reinsurance Plan, introduced on February 22, 2018. H.B. 2539, 99th General Assembly (Mo. 2018).8 vii. Governor Otter of Idaho recently issued an Executive Order to the Idaho Depart- ment of Insurance to \"approve [health - insurance plans] that follow all State - based requirements, even if not all [ACA] requirements are met.\" Office of Governor C.L. \"Butch \" Otter, Executive Order No. 2018- 02 (Jan. 5, 2018).9 The Idaho Department of Insurance has is- sued a bulletin implementing this order. Idaho Dep't of Ins., Bulletin No. 18-01 (Jan. 24, 2018).10 viii. Maryland began investigating the en- actment of its own state -level individual mandate to replace the amended ACA individual mandate.11 8 See https://www.house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills181/hlrbillspdf/ 5903H.01I.pd f. 9 See https://gov.idaho.gov/mediacenter/execorders/eo2018/EO% 202018-02.pdf. 10 See https://doi.idaho.gov/DisplayPDF?Id=4712. 11 See Josh Hicks, With Obama's Federal Mandate Disappearing, Md. Democrats Push 'Down Payment' Plan, Wash. Post (Jan. 9, 54 ix. Other States will need to take similar corrective measures to address the ACA's irrational regime. 40. The unconstitutional individual mandate, along with the ACA itself, significantly harms and im- pacts the States as Medicaid and CHIP providers: a. The United States Congress created the Medicaid program in 1965. See Social Secu- rity Amendments of 1965, Pub. L. No. 89- 97, 79 Stat. 286 (1965). Medicaid is jointly funded by the United States and the States to provide healthcare to individuals with in- sufficient income and resources. See gener- ally 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396- 1396w. To participate in Medicaid, States must pro- vide coverage to a federally- mandated cate- gory of individuals and according to a federally- approved State plan. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a; 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 430.10 -430.12. All 50 States participate in the Medicaid program.12 b. The United States Congress created the Children 's Health Insurance Program (\"CHIP\") in 1997. See Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-33, Title IV, Subti- tle J, 111 Stat. 251 (Aug. 5, 1997). The fed- eral government and the States jointly fund CHIP to provide healthcare for uninsured children that do not qualify for Medicaid. 12 Federal Financial Participation in State Assistance Expendi- tures; Federal Matching Shares for Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and Aid to Needy Aged, Blind, or Dis-abled Persons for October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015, 79 Fed. Reg. 3385 (Jan. 21, 2014). 55 See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1397aa. CHIP covers chil- dren in families who have too much income to qualify for Medicaid, but cannot afford to buy private insurance. CHIP provides basic primary health care services to children, as well as other medically necessary services, including dental care. All States now par- ticipate in CHIP since its creation in 1997. c. Because Medicaid and CHIP are entitle- ment programs, States cannot limit the number of eligible people who can enroll, and Medicaid and CHIP must pay for all services covered under the program. Providing health care to individuals with insufficient income or resources through the Medicaid or CHIP programs is a signif- icant function of state government. d. One avenue for individuals to comply with Section 5000A 's individual mandate is to apply for Medicaid or CHIP. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(f)(1)( A)(iii). Thus, because of the individual mandate and the ACA, many in- dividuals became eligible for Medicaid, or may have been previously eligible but opted not to enroll. Either way, the individual mandate requires millions more to enroll in Medicaid, impo sing additional costs on the States. This reality does not represent \" un- fettered choices made by independent [state] actors, \" ASARCO In c. v. Kadish , 490 U.S. 605, 615 (1989), but is rather a direct consequence of the individual mandate and the ACA, leaving Medicaid as the only op- tion through which numerous individuals may comply. 56 e. As the CBO explained before both the en- actment of ACA and the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, at least some individuals will obtain health insur- ance because of the mandate, even absent any tax penalty. See CBO 2017 Report 1. f. The mandate forcing more individuals onto Medicaid or CHIP causes significant mone- tary injuries to the States, because these programs obligate the States to share the expenses of coverage with the federal gov- ernment. 41. Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H, the ACA harms the States as large employers: a. The ACA requires States, as large employ- ers, to offer their employees health -insur- ance plans with minimum essential benefits defined solely by the Federal Gov- ernment. b. If a State wished to pursue other health -in- surance policies for its employees, perhaps by offering insurance with a different as- sortment of coverage benefits, the Federal Government will tax or penalize the State. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H . 4980I. As an employer, Wisconsin must do \"considerable work \" re- structuring its health -insurance offerings 57 to avoid this costly measure.13 This work \"may have a significant effect on future plan design and maximum benefit limita- tions. \"14 d. Because of the costs of the ACA, a major Wisconsin health insurer, Assurant Health, ceased its Wisconsin operations.15 This cost Wisconsin approximately 1,200 jobs.16 e. T he ACA resulted in the repeal of Wiscon- sin's high-risk pool, the Health Insurance Risk -Sharing Plan, which effectively man- aged the health -insurance needs of high- risk individuals before the full implementa- tion of the ACA. Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 149.10- .53 (2011- 12) (statutory framework for Wiscon- sin Health Insurance Risk-Sharing Plan), repealed by 2013 Wis. Act 20, \u00a7 1900n; see generally Wis.

If state employees obtain subsidized insur- ance from an exchange instead of from a state plan, the Federal Government will tax or penalize the state. g. More employees will join state -sponsored plans because of the mandate, imposing ad- ditional costs upon the States. See CBO 2017 Report 1. In Texas, for example, from FY13 -FY17, the Texas Group Benefits Pro- gram, administered by the Employees Re- tirement System of Texas, spent $487 million on ACA-related costs. 2016 Group Benefits Program Comprehensive Annual Report , Employees Retirement System of Texas (Feb. 2017).17 h. Nebraska, for example, has borne signifi- cant new costs at the behest of the ACA. Ne- braska, like other States, must offer non- full time employees (i.e., employees work- ing 30-39 hours per week) health insurance plans with premiums identical to those of- fered to full time employees. i. In Missouri, revenue is drained by faster - than -projected growth in health care ex- penditures, driven in part by the impact of the ACA. Accordingly, Governor Greitens's budget for Fiscal Year 2018 includes more than $572 million in cuts across Missouri state government and reduces the State 's workforce by 188 positions. Mo. Office of 17 See Summary, Budget, (2018).18 For Fiscal Year 2019, the prob- lems continue. \"Health care costs paid by the government continue to skyrocket. Obamacare has still not been repealed, and the cost of health care continues to rise. Taxpayers pay more and more for govern- ment health care every year with little or no improvement in results. \" Mo. Office of Ad- min., Fiscal Year 2019 Budget Priorities, The Missouri Budget.19 In South Dakota, the estimated cost impact of the ACA upon the South Dakota State Employee Benefits Program for FY 2015- 2018 is as follows: $10,400 for the review of denied appeals; $19,140,252 for the elimi- nation of the lifetime maximum; $4,575,200 for the expanded preventive services paid only by the plan; $3,202,942 for the Transi- tional Reinsurance Program fee (fee im- posed on self-funded plans); $172,141 for the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute fee (fee imposed on self-funded plans); $1,514,205 for the expanded health plan eligibility for part-time employees who did not meet the pre-ACA eligibility defini- tion; $100,000 for the Form 1095-C admin- istration. To date, South Dakota is unable to accurately estimate the cost of the pre- existing conditions e xclusion or the ex- 18 See https://oa.mo.gov/sites/default/files/FY_2018_Budget_ Summary_Abridged.pdf. 19 See https://oa.mo.gov/sit es/default/files/FY_2019_Budget_ Summary.pdf. 60 panded eligibility for adult dependent chil- dren to age 26, though upon information and belief, those qualifiers have increased the costs for South Dakota 's taxpayers. 42. Under the ACA health insurance plans avail- able to Individual Plaintiffs Hurley and Nantz, Indi- vidual Plaintiffs pay dramatically more than prior to the ACA, have lost access to the doctors and health care providers of their choice, and are unable to pur- chase a health insurance plan that meets their needs and preferences. 43. The ACA injures Individual Plaintiffs Hurley and Nantz by mandating that they purchase mini- mum essen tial health insurance coverage despite the Supreme Court 's determination that the requirement is unconstitutional. Despite the reduction of the indi- vidual mandate penalty to $0.00 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Individual Plaintiffs have an obligation to comply with the individual mandate under the ACA while it remains federal law, despite the provision's unconstitutionality. 44. The ACA further injures the Individual Plain- tiffs by establishing a health -care insurance regula- tory system that prevents the Individual Plaintiffs from purchasing health insurance under a free-mar- ket system that would allow them to have lower pre- miums, choice in provider, and options for h ealth insurance plans. 45. The ACA further injures the Individual Plain- tiffs by requiring them to divert resources from their businesses in order to obtain qualifying health insur- ance coverage, regardless of their judgment as to whether maintaining such coverage is a worthwhile 61 cost of doing business, thereby harming their abilities to maintain their own businesses. 46. In the absence of the ACA, the Individual Plaintiffs would purchase a health -insurance plan dif- ferent from the ACA- compliant plans that they are currently required to purchase were they afforded the option without the ACA. 47. Each of the injuries to Individual Plaintiffs is caused by the Defendants ' continued enforcement of the Affordable Care Act, and each of these injuries will be redressed by a declaratory judgment from this Court pronouncing the Affordable Care Act unconsti- tutional. IV. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF COUNT ONE Declaratory Judgment That the Individual Mandate of the ACA Exceeds Congress 's Article I Constitutional Enumerated Powers 48. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations con- tained in paragraphs 1 through 47 as if fully set forth herein. 49. Section 5000A 's individual mandate exceeds Congress's enumerated powers by forcing Individual Plaintiffs to maintain ACA- compliant health insur- ance coverage. Congress lacks the authority under the Commerce Clause and Necessary and Proper Clause to command individuals to purchase health insurance, and the individual mandate cannot be upheld under any other provision of the Constitution. 50. As a majority of the Supreme Court concluded, the \"most straightforward reading of\" Section 5000A \"is that it commands individuals to purchase insur- ance. \" NFIB , 567 U.S. at 562- 63 (Roberts, C.J.); id. at 62 663- 65 (Dissenting Op.). Thus, Congress lacks author- ity under the Commerce Clause and Necessary and Proper Clause to command individuals to purchase health insurance. 51. In NFIB , a different majority of the Supreme Court saved Section 5000A from unconstitutionality by interpreting it not as a mandate enforced by a sep- arate tax penalty, but by combining the mandate with the tax penalty and treating those provisions as a sin- gle tax on individuals who chose to go without insur- ance. 567 U.S. at 563 (Roberts, C.J.). 52. The Constitution grants to Congress the \"Power to lay and collect Taxes . . . to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Wel- fare of the United States. \" U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1. 53. A provision that raises no revenue is not a tax because it does nothing to \"pay the Debts \" or \" provide for the common Defense and general Welfare of the United States. \" Indeed, \" the essentia l feature of any tax\" is the \"produc[tion] [of] at least some revenue for the Government.\" NFIB , 567 U.S. at 564- 65, 574. 54. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2 017 reduced Section 5000A 's tax penalty to $0. Pub. L. No. 115-97, \u00a7 11081. Accordingly, Section 5000A no longer pos- sesses \" the essential feature of any tax\"; it no longer \"produces at least some revenue for the Government. \" 55. Therefore, after Congress amended Section 5000A, it is no longer possible to interpret this statute as a tax enacted pursuant to a valid exercise of Con- gress 's constitutional power to tax. Rather, the only reading available is the most natural one; Section 5000A contains a stand -alone legal mandate. 56. No other provision of the Constitution sup- ports Congress's claimed authority to enact Section 63 5000A 's individual mandate. Accordingly, Section 5000A 's individual mandate is unconstitutional. 57. The remainder of the ACA is non-severable from the individual mandate, meaning that the Act must be invalidated in whole. 58. Alternatively , and at the very minimum, as even the Obama Administration conceded in its brief- ing in NFIB , the guaranteed- issue and community - rating provisions are non-severable from the mandate and must be invalidated along with the individual mandate. 59. Because of Defendants ' actions, Plaintiffs have suffered, and continue to suffer, irreparable in- jury. 60. Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the individual mandate of the ACA exceeds Congress's Ar- ticle I constitutionally enumerated powers. Plaintiffs also are entitled to a permanent injunction against Defendants from implementing, regulating, or other- wise enforcing any part of the ACA because its re- quirements are unlawful and not severable from the unconstitutional individual mandate. COUNT TWO Declaratory Judgment that the ACA Violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend- ment to the Constitution 61. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations con- tained in paragraphs 1 through 60 as if fully set forth herein. 62. The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend- ment provides \"nor shall any person . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" U.S. Const. amend. V. 64 63. The Fifth Amendment contains an \"implicit \" \"equal protection principle \" binding the federal Gov- that imposes irrational require- ments violates the Due Process Clause. 65. Given that Section 5000A 's individual man- date is unconstitutional, the rest of the ACA is irra- tional under Congress's own f indings. 66. The ACA lacks a rational basis now that the individual mandate 's tax penalty has been repealed. 67. Section 18091(2)(I), the chief legislative find- ing in the ACA, explains that \" [t]he requirement [to buy health insurance] is essential to creat ing effective health insurance markets in which improved health insurance products that are guaranteed issue and do not exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions can be sold. \" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(I). 68. Given that the ACA's \" essential \" feature \u2014the individual mandate \u2014is unconstitutional, the law now imposes irrational requirements, in violation of the Due Process Clause. 69. Because of Defendants ' actions, Plaintiffs have suffered, and continue to suffer, irreparable in- jury. 70. Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the ACA violates the Due Process Clause to the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs also a re entitled to a perma- nent injunction against Defendants from implement- ing, regulating, or otherwise enforcing any part of the ACA because its requirements are unlawful and not severable from the unconstitutional individual man- date. 65 COUNT THREE Declaratory Judgment That the ACA Violates the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution 71. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations con- tained in paragraphs 1 through 70 as if fully set forth herein. 72. The Tenth Amendment provides: \" The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" U.S. Const. amen d. X. 73. Legislation that is irrational is outside the powers delegated to the United States by the Consti- tution. 74. Under Congress's own findings, the ACA lacks a rational basis now that the individual mandate 's tax penalty has been repealed and the individual mandate is unconstitutional. See supra \u00b6\u00b6 53-62. 75. The ACA is therefore not within the powers delegated to the United States. 76. Because of Defendants ' actions, Plaintiffs have suffered, and continue to suffer, irreparable in- jury. 77. Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the ACA violates the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs also are entitled to a permanent injunction against Defendants from imple- menting, regulating, or otherwise enforcing any part of the ACA because its requirements are unlawful and not severable from th e unconstitutional individual mandate. 66 COUNT FOUR Declaratory Judgment Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 that Agency Rules Promulgated Pursuant to the ACA Are Unlawful 78. Plaintiffs incorporate the allegat ions con- tained in paragraphs 1 through 77 as if fully set forth herein. 79. The Administrative Procedure Act requires the Court to hold unlawful and set aside any agency action that is, among other things, (a) arbitrary, capri- cious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in ac- cordance with law; (b) contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; and (c) in excess of stat- utory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2). 80. The Department and Service are both \"agenc[ies]\" under the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1), and the regulations and rules prom- ulgated pursuant to the ACA are \"rules \" under the Ad- ministrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(4). 81. Because the ACA exceeds Congre ss's Article I Constitutional enumerated powers and violates the Fifth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution for the reasons described in prior paragraphs, all regula- tions promulgated pursuant to, implementing, or en- forcing, the ACA are arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, and in excess of agency authority. 82. Because of Defendants ' a ctions, Plaintiffs have suffered, and continue to suffer, irreparable in- jury. 83. Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that regulations promulgated pursuant to, implementing, 67 or enforcing the ACA violates the Administrative Pro- cedure Act.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET Defendants NANTZ _______ I, John Nantz, do hereby declare: 1. I am a citizen o f the United States and a resi- dent of Austin, Texas. 2. I am 31 years old. 3. I am single. I have no dependents. 4. I am self -employed, and the founder of a man- agement consulting business. I advise clients on max- imizing growth potential, and develop orga nizational plans and digital strategic plans. 5. I am ineligible for health insurance coverage through an employer, Medicare, Medicaid, or the Chil-dren 's Health Insurance Program. 6. I am ineligible to receive a subsidy from the federal government to purch ase health insurance cov- erage. 72 7. I am currently covered under an individual health insurance plan that meets minimum standards under the Affordable Care Act. 8. For the 2018 calendar year, I purchased health insurance from Oscar Insurance based on a rec-ommendation from Stride Health (an individual insur- ance advisory company). I am enrolled in the Oscar Saver Bronze Plan, an ACA- compliant individual health insurance plan. 9. My monthly premium is $266.56. I must pay a deductible of $6,500.00 annually befo re my health insurance company begins to pay for covered health care services. As stated on Oscar Insurance 's website, \"You pay the full price for covered medical services un- til you spend $6,500.00. After that, Oscar pays the full amount of your covered medical care (in -network only)\" . The plan also includes a select set of compli- mentary services including an annual routine physical examination and Doctor on Demand access. The full list of complimentary services can be found at https://www.hioscar.com/b enefits/preventive/. 10. I have been enrolled in an ACA -mandated plan since 2014. Before that, I was enrolled in an em-ployer- sponsored plan offered by McKinsey & Com- pany, which offered access to a much wider network of providers. The cost of my current p lan is high given the high deductible, limited network of providers and my age and health status. I enrolled in this plan be-cause I was required by the ACA to do so; I do not be- lieve it provides sufficient value to warrant the cost. 11. My plan is an Excl usive Provider Organiza- tion (EPO) Plan. I am limited to using the health care providers within the network. The plan provides no out-of- network benefits. 73 12. I am young and in good health. I have received minimal professional medical care for years with my use of the healthcare system limited almost exclu- sively to seeing sports therapists and chiropractors which I have paid out -of-pocket or with my HSA. The money that I have paid for ACA -mandated health in- surance premiums would have been much better spent on additional contributions to a Health Savings Ac- count and/or basic catastrophic insurance, which would be my preferred insurance option. 13. The ACA has greatly increased my health in- surance costs. My preference would be to purchase reasonably -priced insurance coverage that is con- sumer -driven in accordance with my actuarial risk. I would maintain health insurance coverage through a plan that offers low premiums and a high deductible priced according to my risks and lifestyle choices. This would be a vailable to me in a consumer -driven, com- petitive insurance market. In this situation, I would contribute to a Health Savings Account, which I would use to pay for my health expenses. 14. The ACA' s individual mandate requires me to divert resources from my business endeavors in order to obtain qualifying health insurance coverage, re- gardless of my own judgment as to whether maintain-ing such coverage is a worthwhile cost of doing business. The additional costs imposed upon me by the individual mandate place a burden on my busi- ness. 15. I value compliance with my legal obligations, and believe that following the law is the right thing to do. The repeal of the associated health insurance tax penalty did not relieve me of the requirement to pur- chase health ins urance. I continue to maintain mini- mum essential health insurance coverage because I 74 am obligated to comply with the Affordable Care Act 's individual mandate, even though doing so is a burden to me. I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Texas and the United States that the fore- going is true and correct.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET Defendants _______ April 26, 2018] _______ DECLARATION OF NEILL HURLEY _______ I, Neill Hurley, do hereby declare: 1. I am a citizen of the United States and a resi- dent of Katy, Texas. 2. I am thirty -nine years old. 3. I am married. I have two dependent children. 4. I am self -employed and own a consulting busi- ness. I am a technology consultant in the parking in- dustry. 5. I am ineligible for health insurance coverage through an employer, Medicare, Medicaid, or the Chil-dren 's Health Insurance Program. 6. I am ineligible to receive a subsidy from the federal government to purchase health insurance cov-erage. 7. I am currently cove red under a family health insurance plan that meets minimum standards under the Affordable Care Act. This plan also covers my wife 76 and our two children. My health insurance company is Community Health Choice, and we are enrolled in the HMO Bronze Plan. 8. I selected and enrolled in my health insurance plan online through www.healthcare.gov - the health insurance marketplace established by the federal gov- ernment and managed by the U.S. Centers for Medi-care and Medicaid Services. 9. My monthly premium is $1 ,081.70. I must pay a deductible of $6,000.00 annually for myself and for each covered family member or until our combined family deductible expenses meet the overall family de- ductible of $12,000.00 annually. 10. I first enrolled in an ACA Gold plan in 20 16. I paid a monthly premium of $912.60. I renewed that plan in 2017, even though the monthly premium had increased by 17 percent to $1,071.50. In October of 2017, I received a notice from my health insurance that my monthly premium for the same plan wo uld in- crease by 49 percent to $1,594.84 if I elected to renew coverage for 2018. I had to enroll in the Bronze plan, which provides an inferior level of coverage, because I could no longer afford to pay for the Gold plan. 11. I was enrolled in a health in surance plan through my previous employer before the ACA man-dated that I obtain coverage. My previous plan was widely accepted by the health care providers in our lo- cal area. I only had to pay a low co -pay for physician visits instead of meeting a high d eductible before any benefits are provided. My monthly premiums under my previous plan were only $425.00. 12. I was unable to obtain a plan through the fed- eral marketplace that was accepted by all of my and my family 's health care providers. I opted to enroll in 77 a plan that was accepted by my children 's pediatri- cian. Our family practice physician, ENT specialist, dermatologist, urgent care facility, and urologist do not accept our ACA plan so we had to find new health care providers that we would not oth erwise choose. Our new health care providers are not of the same quality as I and my family had before. Some of our new health care providers have limited the number of appointments available to patients with ACA plans, which delays my ability to timely access health care for me and my family. 13. The ACA prevents me from obtaining care from my preferred health care providers and has greatly increased my health insurance costs. I would purchase reasonably -priced insurance coverage that allowed me to acc ess care locally from my preferred service providers, were I not limited to the plans pro-vided through the federal health insurance market- place. 14. The ACA' s individual mandate requires me to divert resources from my business endeavors in order to obtain qualifying health insurance coverage, re-gardless of my own judgment as to whether maintain- ing such is a worthwhile cost of doing business. The additional costs imposed upon me by the individual mandate place a burden on my business. 15. I value compliance with my legal obligations, and believe that following the law is the right thing to do. The repeal of the associated tax penalty did not relieve me of the requirement to purchase health in- surance. I continue to maintain minimum essential health insuranc e coverage because I am obligated to comply with the Affordable Care Act 's individual man- date. 78 I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of Texas and the United States that the fore- going is true and correct.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET E DURAN _______ I, Blaise Duran, am a citizen of the United States, am over the age of eighteen, and am competent to testify. The following statements are tr ue and correct based on my personal knowledge: 1. I am the Manager for Underwriting, Data Analysis and Reporting for the Employees Retirement System of Texas ( \"ERS\"), the agency that provides re- tirement and other benefit programs for Texas em- ployees, retirees, and their dependents. As the Manager for Underwriting, Data Analysis and Report- ing for ERS, my responsibilities include analyzing the financial impact to the Texas Employees Group Bene- fits Program ( \"GBP \") health benefit plans related to the requirements of the Patient Protection and Afford- able Care Act (ACA), including certain actions re- quired by state laws amended by the Texas Legislature in 2011 and 2013 related to ACA require-ments. I have personal knowledge of the information set forth herein. To th e extent that the information 80 herein is a statement of the financial cost or benefit to the GBP, my personal knowledge is based on infor- mation provided by ERS ' GBP consulting actuaries and my review of the reasonableness of the assump- tions and methodology used by the consulting actuar- ies to obtain the stated numbers. 2. ERS administers the GBP, which provides coverage for health, life, dental, voluntary accidental death and dismember -ment, vision and short and long- term disability. One objective for offerin g GBP benefits is to enable the state to attract and retain competent and able employees by providing employees and their dependents with life, accident, and health benefit coverages at least equal to those commonly provided in private industry. 3. As of A ugust 31, 2017, GBP health insurance plans cover about one of every 53 Texans. 4. As of August 31, 2017, ERS had 534,101 GBP plan participants. 5. For GBP health plan participants, ERS paid about $3.5 billion in medical and pharmacy claims for self-funded plans and premiums for fully insured plans for fiscal year ( \"FY\") 2017, which ran from Sep- tember 1, 2016 to August 31, 2017. 6. The GBP health plans have instituted plan de- sign changes and taken additional actions, as set forth below, in connection with th e ACA, including certain actions required by state laws amended by the Texas Legislature in 2011 and 2013 related to ACA require- ments. 7. The ACA contains a prohibition against life- time and annual dollar limits for essential health ben-efits, whether in -network or out -of-network. Prior to the ACA, the GBP contained a $l million lifetime limit 81 on out -of-network coverage; there was no similar limit on in -network coverage. This limit was removed effec- tive September 1, 2010. As a result of this plan design chang e, the GBP has paid approximately an addi- tional $0.3 million for FY 2011, $0.3 $0.3 million for FY 2013, $0.3 million for FY 2014, $0.3 million for FY 2015, $0.4 million for FY 2016, and $0.4 million for FY 2017. Accordingly, for the s even- year period between FY 2011 and FY 2017, the GBP has paid approximately $2.3 million in costs due to this plan design change. 8. The ACA requires provision of coverage for de- pendent children up to age 26, whether or not they are married. Prior to the ACA, the GBP provided coverage for eligible unmarried dependent children up to age 25. Coverage was expanded to all eligible dependent children up to age 26 effective September l, 2011. As a result of this plan design change, the GBP has paid approximately an additional $7.6 million for FY 2012, $11.1 million for FY 2013, $12.0 million for FY 2014, $13.5 million for FY 2015, $18.3 million for FY 2016, and $19.2 million for FY 2017. Accordingly, for the six - year period between FY 2012 and FY 2017, the GBP has paid approximately $81.7 million in costs due to this plan design change. 9. The ACA requires coverage of certain preven- tive care services at no cost -share (that is, no co -pay- ment, coinsurance or deductible) to the health plan participant. Effective Sep tember 1, 2011, the GBP be- gan providing this coverage at no cost -share. As a re- sult of this plan design change, the GBP has paid approximately an additional $20.3 million for FY 2012, $21.8 million for FY 2013, $23.0 million for FY 2014, $24.6 million for FY 2015, $26.0 million for FY 2016, and $27.2 million for FY 2017. Accordingly, for 82 the six -year period between FY 2012 and FY 2017, the GBP has paid approximately $142.9 million in costs due to this plan design change. 10. The ACA requires coverage of cer tain contra- ceptives for women at no cost share. The GBP began providing this coverage at no cost share on September 1, 2012. As a result of this plan design change, the GBP has paid approximately an additional $8.6 mil- lion for FY 2013, $8.3 million for FY $8.8 million for FY 2015, $9.3 million for FY 2016, and $8 million for FY 2017. Accordingly, for the five -year period be- tween FY 2013 and FY 2017, the GBP has paid ap-proximately $43 million in costs due to this plan design change. 11. The ACA prohibi ts health plan coverage wait- ing periods that exceed 90 days. As a result, Section 1551.1055 of the Texas Insurance Code was amended to provide that eligibility under the GBP health plans begins not later than the 90 th day after the date of em- ployment. Effe ctive September l, 2014, eligible new employees and their eligible dependents are now en-rolled effective the first day of the month following the 60 th day of employment. Prior to this ACA require- ment and related amendment to the state statute, ERS enrolled employees on the first day of the month after the 90 th day of employment. Because administra- tion of the GBP health plans provides for coverage to begin on the first day of the month following an em-ployee' s or dependent 's first eligibility to participate in the plan, the waiting period was changed to 60 days to ensure compliance with the ACA 's 90-day limit. As a result of this plan design change, the GBP has paid approximately an additional $19.3 million for FY 2015, $21.0 million for FY 2016, and $22.8 mil lion for 83 FY 2017. Accordingly, for the three -year period be- tween FY 2015 and FY 2017, the GBP has paid ap- proximately $63.1 million in costs due to this plan design change. 12. The ACA provides for an out -of-pocket maxi- mum on participant cost share for in -network essen- tial health benefits. The GBP implemented an out -of- pocket maximum on in -network medical coverage ef- fective September l, 2014, and implemented an out -of- pocket maximum on in -network medical and prescrip- tion drug coverage effective September l, 2015. As a result of this plan design change, the GBP has paid approximately an additional $0.1 million for FY 2015, $0.4 million for FY 2016, and $0.4 million for FY 2017. Accordingly, for the three -year period between FY 2015 and FY 2017, the GBP has pai d approximately $0.9 million in costs due to this plan design change. 13. Under the ACA, employers are required to of- fer minimum essential health coverage for all full -time employees and this coverage must be affordable and offer minimum value. A \" full-time employee\" is de- fined generally as a person working on average 30 hours per week. The GBP definition of an eligible full - time employee was changed from an employee work-ing 40 hours per week to one working 30 hours per week effective September 1, 2013. As a result of this plan design change, the GBP has paid approximately an additional $4.2 million for FY 2014, $4.4 million for FY 2015, $4.7 million for FY 2016, and $5.0 million, for FY 2017. Accordingly, for the four- year period be- tween FY 2014 and FY 2017, the GBP has paid ap- proximately $18.3 million in costs due to this plan design change. 14. The ACA requires payment of PCOR (Patient - Centered Outcomes Research) Fees for seven years. 84 The PCOR fees apply to plan years ending after Octo- ber 1, 2012 and befor e October l, 2019; i.e., in the case of the GBP, FY 2013 - FY 2019. The $0.9 million for FY 2015, $0.9 million for FY 2016, and $1.0 million for FY 2017. Accordingly, for the five -year period between FY 2013 and FY 2017, the GBP has paid approximately $4.1 million in costs due to this fee. 15. The ACA established the Transitional Rein- surance Program (TRP) to which health insurers and group health plans were required to contribute. Th e GBP contributed to this program, which was opera- tional for calendar years 2014 - 2016. The TRP im- pacted GBP cost across 2017. The GBP paid for FY 2014, $22.1 million for FY 2015, $14.5 million f or FY 2016, and $4.0 million for FY 2017. Accordingly, for the four -year period between FY 2014 and FY 2017, the GBP has paid approximately $59.1 million in costs due to this program. 16. Beginning with calendar year (CY) 2014, the ACA requires payment of an annual fee by health in-surance providers. The amount payable is the in- surer' s proportionate share of the aggregate fee for that year as statutorily defined. Certain of the GBP 's fully insured health plans are subject to this fee, which can be passed thr ough to the GBP as part of the plans ' premiums. There are moratoriums on these fees for CY 2017 and CY 2019. Thus far, these fees have im- pacted GBP cost across four fiscal years: FY 2014 FY 2017. The GBP paid fees of approximately $8.9 million for FY 201 4, $19.3 million for FY 2015, $22.1 million $7.5 million for FY 2017. Accord- ingly, for the four -year period between FY 2014 and 85 FY 2017, the GBP has paid approximately $57.8 mil- lion due to this fee. Unless the there is a change to the requ irement, ERS will continue to comply as required. 17. Although participation was not required, the GBP participated in the ACA 's Early Retiree Reinsur- ance Program (ERRP), receiving reimbursement of certain benefit payments for coverage of its early re-tiree s during FY 2010 and FY 2011. The GBP received reimbursements of approximately $30.2 million in FY 2011 and $40.7 million in FY 2012. Accordingly, in the two-year period FY 2011 and FY 2012, the GBP re- ceived approximately $70.9 million due to this pro-gram. 18. The ACA established the Coverage Gap Dis- count Program (CGDP) under Medicare Part D which commenced January l, 2011. The CGDP provides man-ufacturer discounts to beneficiaries in connection with prescription drug expenditures in the Part D coverage gap. The GBP provided prescription drug coverage to Medicare -eligible participants under HealthSelect un- til January I, 2013, at which time such coverage was transferred to HealthSelect Medicare Rx, a self - funded Employer Group Waiver Plan under Medicare Part D . Since HealthSelect Medicare Rx participants only pay the plan copay for prescription drugs that would otherwise fall in the coverage gap, the GBP is eligible to receive the manufacturer discounts in order to offset a portion of the cost of HealthSelect M edicare Rx. The GBP received discounts in connection with prescription drugs dispensed of approximately $15.4 million in FY 2013, $39.7 million in FY 2014, $27.7 million in FY 2015, $48.2 million in FY 2016, and $40.0 million in FY 2017. Accordingly, in th e five- year period between FY 2013 and FY 2017, the GBP has 86 received approximately $171.0 million due to this pro- gram. 19. Compliance with the ACA has imposed costs on the GBP approximating $0.3 million in FY 2011, $28.2 $42.3 million for FY 2013, $76.0 million for FY 2014, $113.3 million for FY 2015, $117.6 million for FY 2016, and $95.5 million for FY 2017. Participation in the ERRP and CGDP by the GBP has resulted for payments to the GBP approxi- mating $30.2 million for FY 2011, $40.7 FY 2012, $15.4 million for FY 2013, $39.7 million for FY 2014, $27.7 million for FY 2015, $48.2 million for FY 2016, and $40.0 million for FY 2017. Accordingly, for the seven -year period between FY 2011 and FY 2017, the GBP has incurred approx imately $473.2 million in costs and received approximately $241.9 million in connection with its ACA compliance. 20. The GBP has made administrative process changes in connection with its ACA compliance, such as those related to the provision of Form 1095 -B's to plan participants and the Internal Revenue Service. 21. The ACA also required ERS to reduce the max- imum annual contribution to the GBP flexible spend- ing account from $5,000 to $2,500 effective September 1, 2013; i.e., for FY 2014. While this require ment does not impact GBP cost, it generates additional cost to employers due to the additional social security taxes they will pay as a result of reduced annual pre -tax con- tributions that employees can make to flexible spend- ing accounts. 22. ERS' process f or making a plan design or ben- efit change to the GBP health plans varies depending on the scope and impact of the change. Plan design 87 and benefit changes and changes to eligibility require- ments require review by ERS staff in order to deter- mine impact to ra tes, financial status of the GBP, and operations. Additionally changes may require legisla- tive action, approval by the ERS Board of Trustees, action by the third party administrator, system changes by ERS and/or system changes by the third party administra tor. 23. So long as the ACA continues to apply to cov- erages authorized and funded under the GBP, then ERS won 't be able to make changes to the plan design that would cause the GBP to discontinue paying claims or costs as addressed in paragraphs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,12, 13 and 14. DECLARATION UNDER PENALTY OF PER- JURY 24. I, Blaise Duran, a citizen of the United States and a resident of Texas, hereby declare under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746 that the fore-going Declaration is true and correct. Respectfully submitted this 11th day of April, 2018. /s/ Blaise Duran Blaise Duran 88 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS FORT WORTH DIVISION ________ Civil Action No. 4:18 -cv-000167-O TEXAS , ET AL ., Plaintiffs , v. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET EL GHASEMI _______ My name is Michael Ghasemi and I am over the age of 18 and fully competent to make this declaration and state the following: 1. I am the Director of the Forecasting depart- ment within Financial Services for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC). In my role as Forecasting Director, I oversee the Forecasting team and all data reporting that we p rovide internally and externally. We provide HHSC client services pro- gram caseload and cost projections as well as histori- cal data for continual budget monitoring purposes, client services appropriations requests, and many other related ad hoc or reporting purposes. 2. Effective January 1, 2014. the ACA created two additional \" mandatory \" populations for Medicaid programs. One of the populations is former foster care children. These are individuals under age 26 who aged out of foster care in the state and who were enrolled in 89 federally- funded Medicaid when they aged out of fos- ter care. Prior to the ACA, HHSC provided Medicaid to the majority of former foster care children up to age 21. The second population is children ages 6 to 18 up to and including 133 per cent of the FPL. These chil- dren were eligible for the Children 's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) prior to the ACA. Prior to the ACA, Medicaid required states to provide coverage for chil- dren through age 5 up to 133% of FPL and 100% of the FPL for children ages 6 to 18. 3. The ACA restricted HHSC to considering only a sole factor to determine eligibility for populations other than those who have a disability or who are el-derly: Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(e)(14). The tax filing rules are now the only permissible consideration used to determine in-come and household composition for purposes of Med- icaid eligibility for those populations. Other income, such as child support and disability payments, cannot be considered. Additionally, HHSC can no longer con- sider deductions to income, such as dependent care or a work -related expense, when determining eligibility. HHSC also cannot consider assets such as a vehicle when evaluating eligibility for Medicaid. 4. Prior to the ACA, HHSC' s poli cy was to allow children 6 months of continuous Medicaid coverage re-gardless of family income changes. Pursuant to the ACA, eligibility redeterminations for Medicaid and CHIP are now allowed no more frequently than one per 12 months, unless the enrollee volunteers to HHSC, or HHSC receives a report, that there is a change that affects eligibility. HHSC conducts peri- odic income checks during the 12 -month certification period. For children, the periodic income check cannot 90 impact the child 's eligibility prior to the end of the con- tinuous eligibility period (first six months). The second six months of the child 's certification period has non - continuous eligibility, and income information can af- fect eligibility. For parents and caretaker relatives, the entire certification period for Medicaid has non - continuous eligibility, and changes in income can af- fect eligibility. 5. Texas 's Medicaid caseload (the number of in- dividuals enrolled in the Medicaid eligibility groups) increased from 3.01 million average monthly i n State Fiscal Year (SFY) 2009 to 4.07 million average monthly in SFY 2017 (figures are rounded). 6. After the implementation of the ACA, there were increases in the Texas Medicaid caseload due to the 12 -month recertification with a periodic income check for children and adults, use of MAGI (rather than income with potential disregards), and former foster care youth population, as well as increases likely due to increased focus and outreach resulting from the ACA. The overall Medicaid caseload rose above 4 million clients by September of 2014, an in-crease of 9.6 percent over September 2013. The follow- ing table provide estimates for ACA -related caseload additions to Medicaid, based on March 2016 forecast data: 91 7. ACA- Related Caseload Additions to Medicaid - March 2016 Estimates1 ACA- Re- lated Caseload Additions cation MAGI Changes/ Newly 472,999 1 All numbers are Average Monthly Recipient Months by SFY (annualized).

As such, distribution of \"type \" of addition to the caseload is estimated for the step -ups due to MAGI changes, 12 - month recertification, and newly -enrolled clients as there is no unique identifier for impacts due to these changes. Underlying caseload data and trends are assumed as a basis for the esti-mates. 92 8. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and c or- rect.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET Defendants _______ STEPHANIE MUTH _______ My name is Stephanie Muth and I am over the age of 18 and fully competent to make this declaration and state the following: 1. I am the State Medicaid Director for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC). In my role as the State Medicaid Director, I oversee Med- icaid and Children 's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) services across Texas. 2. Medicaid is funded by both the state and fed- eral governments. The federal share of Medicaid funds Texas receives is based on the Federal Medical Assis-tance Percentage (FMA P). The FMAP is calculated an- nually using each state 's per capita personal income in relation to the U.S. average. The Federal Fiscal Year 2018 FMAP for Texas is 56.88%, meaning the fed- eral/state share of Medicaid funding is 56.88%/43.12% for most client s ervices. 94 3. Medicaid cost is determined by the caseload \u2014 the volume or number of individuals served in each Medicaid eligibility group \u2014and cost per client \u2014a function of the number, type, and cost of the services a client receives, and how those services ar e provided. 4. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates cer- tain Medicaid benefits Texas is required to cover. Ra-ther than allowing HHSC to make such determinations based on the needs of Texas 's popula- tion, the ACA imposed a rule upon Texas that man- dated rein stating birthing centers as a Medicaid provider, providing Medicaid reimbursement to pro-viders recognized by states as licensed birth attend-ants, recognizing licensed midwives as a provider type, and implementing comprehensive tobacco cessa- tion services for pregnant women. 5. The ACA requires all Medicaid providers to re- validate their enrollment information every three to five years. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 455.414. All durable medical equipment providers are required to revalidate enroll- ment information at least once every three years. All other provider types must revalidate their enrollment information at least once every five years. The ACA also requires states to collect an application fee as a condition for newly enrolling or re -enrolling institu- tional providers. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 455.460. 6. As part of HHSC 's implementation of the ACA' s requirements, HHSC contracted with the Texas Medicaid & Healthcare Partnership (TMHP) to imple- ment two initiatives related to the provider revalida- tion required by the ACA. One initiativ e was the ACA Provider Re -Enrollment tive, for which paid TMHP $17,107,072 ($12,632,677 in federal funds and $4,474,395 in state general revenue) for TMHP 's work performed on this 95 initiative from August 1, 2014 through July 31, 2017. This initiative required TMHP to perform various tasks \u2014such as developing an enrollment application, educating the provider community about the need to re-enroll, and answering providers ' questions about how to complete the application \u2014in support o f the provider revalidation required by the ACA. The second initiative was the ACA Provider Re -enrollment Quick Hits initiative in 2014 -2015, for which HHSC paid TMHP $2,084,215 ($1,829,444 in federal funds and $254,771 state general revenue). This init iative re- quired TMHP to make several enhancements to the then -existing provider enrollment technology to sup- port the ACA provider enrollment regulations. 7. HHSC 's Medicaid operations staff spent sig- nificant amounts of time working on ACA -related is- sues, i ncluding the ACA provider re -enrollment. Medicaid operations had two staff members (a Project Manager and a Business Analyst) assigned full time to ACA- related work for two years. Medicaid opera- tions also had another Program Manager and the Di-rector workin g on ACA- related issues. The estimated cost to HHSC for these employees ' work on the ACA was $387,082 over a two -year time period. 8. Beginning in January 2014, HHSC was re- quired by the ACA to pay an annual excise tax to the federal government known as the Health Insurer Tax. The tax is based on the amount of health insurance premiums collected. HIT will continue to increase with premium growth. In SFY 2017, HHSC paid $112,044,306.98 in general revenue for Medicaid and $1,078,737.40 in general revenue for C HIP for the Health Insurer Tax, for a total of $113,123,044.38 in general revenue for the Health Insurer Tax. 96 9. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and cor- rect.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET Defendants _______ WAYNE SALTER _______ My name is Wayne Salter and I am over the age of 18 and fully com petent to make this declaration and state the following: 1. I am the Associate Commissioner for Access and Eligibility Services for the Texas Health and Hu-man Services Commission (HHSC). HHSC Access and Eligibility Services determines eligibility in Texas for Medicaid and the Children 's Health Insurance Pro- gram (CHIP). As Associate Commissioner for Access and Eligibility Services, I oversee more than 11,000 employees responsible for delivering public assistance programs including Medicaid, Supplemental Nutr i- tion Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, disability determination services and community -based programs and services to mil- lions of Texans every year. 2. HHSC administers Medicaid at the state level to residents of Texas. Texas Medicaid serves: (1) low - income families, (2) children, (3) pregnant women, (4) 98 elders, and (5) people with disabilities. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) added an additional category: former foster care youth. These are individuals under age 26 who aged out of foster care in the state and who were enrolled in federally -funded Medicaid when they aged out of foster care. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(IX) (West); Affordable Care Act, Pub L 111448, Stat. 865, \u00a7 2004. Were the ACA repealed, HHSC would sti ll be required to provide Medicaid to former foster care youth up to age 21. 3. Financial eligibility for Medicaid and many other social programs is based on a family 's income level as compared to Federal Poverty Level (FPL). The FPL is intended to identif y the minimum amount of income a family would need to meet very basic family needs. 4. Prior to the passage of the ACA, HHSC used these factors to determine eligibility for Medicaid: (1) family income, (2) age, (3) assets, (4) other factors such as being a child, parent, or caretaker relative, a pregnant woman, or an elderly or disabled individual. HHSC reviewed eligibility criteria for Medicaid enrol-lees every 6 months allowing for a quick determina- tion should anyone become ineligible for Medicaid due to no longer meeting Medicaid eligibility criteria such as household income increasing above the FPL. 5. Effective January 1, 2014, the ACA expanded Medicaid to the following populations: o As noted above, one of the populations is former foster care children u nder age 26, and Texas is required to enroll that popu- lation in Medicaid without applying a fi- nancial test. Pub. L. 111- 148, 124 Stat. 271, \u00a7 2002. 99 o The second population is children ages 6 to 18 up to and including 133 percent of the FPL (these children we re ineligible for CHIP prior to the ACA). 6. Prior to the ACA, Medicaid required states to provide coverage for children through age 5 up to 133% of FPL and 100% of the FPL for children ages 6 to 18. If the ACA were repealed, HHSC could return to using 100 % FPL limit for children ages 6 to 18. 7. The ACA restricted HHSC to considering only a sole factor to determine eligibility for populations other than those who have a disability or who are el- derly: Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (e)(14). The tax filing rules are now the only permissible consideration used to determine in-come and household composition for purposes of Med-icaid eligibility for those populations. Other income, such as child support and disability payments, cannot be considered. Additionally, HHSC can no longer con-sider deductions to income, such as dependent care or a work -related expense, when determine eligibility. The FPL for each type of Medical assistance program was adjusted to account for the loss of deductions. 8. Under the ACA, HHSC cannot consider assets such as a vehicle or home when evaluating eligibility for Medicaid. HHSC has always exempted the home- stead when evaluating eligibility for Medicaid. Were HHSC not subject to operating within the confines of the ACA, it could use pre -ACA income determination methodologies to account for considerations such as assets and alternate income that factor into a house-hold' s income status. 100 9. Prior to the ACA, HHSC' s policy was to allow children 6 months of continuous M edicaid coverage re- gardless of family income changes. Pursuant to the ACA, eligibility redeterminations for Medicaid and CHIP are now allowed no more frequently than one per 12 months, unless the enrollee volunteers to HHSC, or HHSC receives a report, that there is a change that affects eligibility. HHSC conducts peri- odic income checks during the 12 -month certification period in which electronic income data is pulled and compared against the income currently being counted for the Medicaid recipient. For chi ldren, the periodic income check is conducted in months five through eight of the certification period and cannot impact the child 's eligibility prior to the end of the continuous el- igibility period (first six months). The second six months of the child 's certification period has non -con- tinuous eligibility, and income information can affect eligibility. For parents and caretaker relatives, the pe-riodic income check is conducted in months three through eight of the certification period. The entire certificat ion period for Medicaid for parents and care- taker relatives has non -continuous eligibility, and changes in income can affect eligibility. If the ACA were repealed, HHSC could revert back to the six month certification period for Children 's Medicaid and Medicaid for Parents and Caretaker Relatives without a statutory change. 10. CHIP provides healthcare coverage for chil- dren under age 19 whose family income exceeds the Children 's Medicaid income limit but is less than or equal to the applicable income limit for CHIP. 1 To 1 Defined in Texas Works Handbook, C -131.1, Federal Poverty Income Limits (FPIL). 101 qualify for CHIP, a child must, among other require- ments, be uninsured for at least 90 days or claim one of the good cause exemptions to this 90 -day waiting period2 as defined by Texas state statute. The ACA ex- panded the reasons for good caus e beyond what was in the Texas state statute. The ACA also prohibits states from imposing a waiting period of longer than 90 days. 42 C.F.R . \u00a7 457. 805(b)(l). Additionally, the ACA im- poses strict requirements on HHSC regarding how to provide notice to appli cants of eligibility determina- tions, including the language that must be used and the exact content of the notice. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 457.340(e). 11. Federal rules require HHSC to track individu- als determined ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP and transfer the infor mation to the Health Insurance Mar- ketplace for coverage. For children subject to the 90 - day CHIP waiting period, HHSC sends their infor-mation to the Marketplace during the waiting period, contacts the Marketplace once the waiting period has ended, and enrolls the child in CHIP coverage. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7457.340(d)(3). HHSC is also required to deter- mine Medicaid or CHIP eligibility for individuals who applied via the Federal Marketplace but were found potentially eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. 12. Subsidies under the ACA are available to adults starting at 100% FPL. 13. The ACA required changes regarding individ- uals with a Medicaid -qualifying immigration status. Prior to the ACA, a non -citizen had to provide proof 2 The waiting period only applies to children who were covered by a third -party health benefits plan (private health insurance) at any time during the 90 days (3 calendar months) before the date of application for CHIP. 102 that the individual had a Medicaid -qualifying immi- gration status before the individual could receive Med- icaid benefits. The ACA created a new mandate requiring HHSC to allow those individuals to receive Medicaid during a period of \" reasonable opportunity \" by simply asserting that they are non -citizens with a Medicaid -qualifying immigration status. Pursuant to the ACA, this mere assertion from an individual im- poses a duty upon HHSC to provide that individual with Medicaid benefits for 90 days while the individ-ual is given the opportunity to verify his or her immi- gration status. If the ACA were repealed, HHSC could revert to its pre -ACA policy requiring verification of U.S. citizenship or alien status prior to determining eligibility. 14. The ACA mandates that HHSC initially adopt a Qualified Hospital' s prelim inary determination of an individual' s eligibility for Medicaid. 42 U.S.C. 1396(a)(47). If a Qualified Hospital determines \u2014 based upon a household 's attestation of income, citi- zenship or immigration status, and Texas residency \u2014 that an individual is Medicaid -eligible, the ACA re- quires HHSC to provide the individual with Medicaid benefits during a period of \" presumptive eligibility \" until HHSC determines whether the individual is \u00b7 el- igible for Medicaid or for two months, whichever is earlier. This could requir e HHSC to provide up to two months of Medicaid benefits to individuals that ulti- mately may not be determined Medicaid -eligible by HHSC. To implement the presumptive eligibility man-date, HHSC built a new website (the Presumptive El- igibility Website) and made updates to the HHSC eligibility determination system (Texas Integrated El- igibility Redesign System, or \" TIERS \"). Prior to the implementation of the ACA, HHSC already provided presumptive Medicaid eligibility benefits to pregnant 103 women and women with brea st or cervical cancer who were determined presumptively eligible by Qualified Entities. If the ACA were to be repealed, HHSC could stop allowing Qualified Hospitals to determine pre-sumptive eligibility for the following programs with- out a change in state l aw: Parent and Caretaker Relative, Pregnant Women, Children under 19, and Former Foster Care. 3 15. The ACA requires HHSC to send tax form 1095- B out to individuals and the Internal Revenue Service. This requirement that HHSC was not subject to prior to the ACA requires HHSC to incur costs in- cluding automation systems, printing, and postage that it would not have otherwise incurred. 16.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET Defendants _______ JAMIE WALKER, ASSIS- TANT DEPUTY COMMISSI ONE R, FINANCIAL REGULATION DIVISION, TEXAS DEPART- MENT OF INSURANCE _______ Introduction 1. My name is Jamie Walker. I am over eighteen years of age, of sound mind, and am competent to tes- tify to the matters contained in this declaration. 2. I am the Assista nt Deputy Commissioner of the Financial Regulation Division at the Texas De-partment of Insurance (TDI). The Financial Regula- tion Division is responsible for financial and solvency related issues, including examinations, troubled com- panies, licensing, withd rawals, managed healthcare networks, and insurance company transactions. As the Assistant Deputy Commissioner, my official duties include managing Financial Regulation staff working on financial and solvency related issues and licensing of insurance market participants. 105 3. In October 2012, I analyzed the business plans, associated financial information, and merger activity related to entrance into the Texas market. In 2013, I oversaw the development and implementation of the navigator rules authorized under SB 1795, 83rd Legislature, Regular Session (2013). Market Entrants 4. Insurance companies and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are required under Insurance Code Chapter 801 to obtain certificates of authority to operate in Texas. The specific requirements for obtain- ing certificates of authority vary by the type of insur- ance or plan being offered by a carrier. Insurance code \u00a7 841.101 requires the issuance of certificates of au- thority for certain domestic insurance companies, which includes health insurance companies offering coverage affected by the Affordable Care Act, before engaging in the business of insurance, except for the lending of money. Insurance Code \u00a7 843.071 prohibits a person from organizing or operating an HMO in Texas without obtaini ng a certificate of authority. In- surance Code \u00a7 982.051 requires the issuance of certif- icates of authority for certain foreign insurance companies, which includes health insurance compa- nies offering coverage affected by the Affordable Care Act, before enga ging in the business of insurance, ex- cept for the lending of money. 5. TDI staff has done an analysis of filings made by carriers wanting to enter the individual health market. No carriers added the accident and health line of authority needed to write individual health cover-age between January 1, 2009, and March 22, 2018. However, new carriers were issued certificates of au- thority with the intent of writing individual health coverage. A summary of the number of carriers issued 106 accident and health certifica tes of authority and writ- ing individual health coverage follows: Calendar Year No. of New Health Carriers 2009 - 2010 - 2011 2 2012 - 2013 - 2014 2 2015 2 2016 1 2017 - 2018 (thru 3/22) - Market Exits 6. An insurer, which includes health insura nce companies, must file with the Commissioner a plan for orderly withdrawal under Insurance Code \u00a7 827.003 if the company reduces its total annual premium volume by 50% or more, or reduces its annual premium by 75% or more in a line of insurance in Texas. Insurance Code \u00a7 843.051 makes an HMO subject to the with-drawal and restriction plan requirements in Insur-ance Code Chapter 827. 7. Under Insurance Code \u00a7 827.005, the Commis- sioner must approve a withdrawal plan that ade-quately provides for the meeting the requirements prescribed by Insurance Code \u00a7 827.004(3), and the Commissioner may modify restrict, or limit a with-drawal plan as necessary if the Commissioner finds that a line of insurance subject to the withdrawal plan 107 is not offered in a quantity or manner to adequately cover the risks in Texas or to adequately protect Tex- ans if the withdrawal plan were approved as submit- ted. 8. Generally, the following actions are involved when TDI receives withdrawal plans. TDI staff re-views the withdrawal plans for c ompleteness and points out deficiencies to the filer when necessary. TDI evaluates whether the plan contents demonstrate that the insurer will be able to meet its contractual obliga-tions, provide service to policyholders and claimants in Texas, and meet an y other statutory obligations. Once TDI has concluded that the plan demonstrates those elements, TDI then considers whether, if the plan is approved, the line of insurance being with- drawn from will continue to be offered in a quantity and manner to adequat ely cover Texas risks. 9. TDI staff has done an analysis of withdrawal plan filings made by carriers between January 1, 2009, and March 22, 2018, affecting participation in the individual health line of business. A summary of the numbers of carriers filing withdrawal plans for the individual health line of business follows: Calendar Year No. of Health Withdrawal Filings 2009 - 2010 - 2011 - 2012 - 2013 2 2014 7 2015 2 108 2016 6 2017 8 2018 (thru 3/22) - As of March 22, 2018, there were 10 carriers o ffering individual health coverage in various Texas regions and one carrier offering coverage statewide. Activities Involving Navigator Regulation 10. During the 83rd Legislature, Regular Session (2013), the Legislature passed SB 1795, which created Insura nce Code Chapter 4154, Navigators for Health Benefit Exchanges. Insurance Code \u00a7 4154.001 stated the purpose of the statute as, \" [s]ince the State of Texas opted out of implementing a state exchange, pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care A ct as amended by the Health Care and Educa- tion Reconciliation Act of 2010, the purpose of this chapter is to provide a state solution to ensure that Texans are able to find and apply for affordable health coverage under any federally run health benefit ex-change while helping consumers in this state. \" Under Insurance Code \u00a7 4154.051, the Commissioner was re-quired to determine whether the standards and quali-fication for navigators provided by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18031 and any regulations enacted under that sec-tion w ere sufficient to ensure that navigators could perform the required duties. If the Commissioner de- termined that the federal standards were insufficient, the Commissioner was further required to make a good faith effort to work in cooperation with the Unite d States Department of Health and Human Ser- vices (HHS) to propose improvement to those stand- ards. If the Commissioner determined that the insufficiencies in the federal standards had not been 109 addressed, the Commissioner was required to estab- lish standards and qualifications by rule to ensure navigators could perform the required duties. 11. The federal regulations enacted under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18031 were adopted in July 2013. TDI staff evaluated the rules. In August 2013, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbot joined 12 other attorneys general in a letter addressing concerns with the federal regu- lations. In a September 2013, letter to the Commis- sioner, Governor Perry also addressed concerns with the standards for navigators set out in federal regula- tions. TDI sought public comment on the sufficiency of the standards in a stakeholder meeting held on Sep-tember 30, 2013. TDI conducted additional investiga- tion into the federal standards for navigators in follow - up to the stakeholder meeting by meeting or holding teleconferences with navigator entities, consumer ad- vocates, and representatives of health care provider groups. TDI also conducted multiple conference calls with HHS regarding the federal standards. TDI posted an outline of solutions for potential insufficien- cies identified during this process and invited addi- tional public comment on the outline. TDI also held a call with HHS on December 2, 2013, to discuss the out- line; HHS indicated that it would not consider revising the regulations to address the issues raised i n the out- line and confirmed that solutions set out in the outline did not present federal preemption concerns. HHS staff suggested that TDI proceed with its proposal of rules. In the adoption of the final TDI rules, which were effective in February 2014, the Commissioner found that insufficiencies existed in the federal stand- ards in the following areas: applicability of federal reg- ulations to individuals and entities providing navigator services; qualifications of individuals who 110 serve as navigators; education requirements for navi- gators; privacy requirements; and accountability of navigators. In order to ensure that Texans were pro- tected, TDI required navigators and navigator entities to register with TDI and provide evidence through the registration proces s that minimum standards were met 12. SB 1795 also included Insurance Code \u00a7 4154.006 which contained an automatic expiration date. The chapter was not extended; therefore, the statute and associated rules adopted by TDI expired on September 1, 2017. Repe al of Texas Health Insurance Pool Statute 13. The Texas Legislature passed SB 1367, 83rd Legislature, Regular Session (2013) abolishing the Texas Health Insurance Pool. The House Research Or-ganization Bill Analysis, dated May 15, 2013, provided in part, \"[ i]n 1997, the 75th Legislature made opera- tional the Texas Health Insurance Pool to sell health insurance policies to individuals unable to get private coverage due to pre -existing health conditions. The pool, as it is known, began offering coverage in 1998 , and enrolled more than 23,000 Texans as of April 2013... Beginning January 1, 2014, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) will require most individuals either obtain health insurance or pay a tax penalty. Individuals purchasing insur ance in a health benefit exchange, an online marketplace of pri- vate, government regulated health insurance plans, will not be denied coverage or charged more based on their health status. \" See Exhibit A, which is a true and correct copy of the House Resear ch Organization Bill Analysis for SB 1367, dated May 15, 2013. In the SB 1367 Senate Research Center Bill Analysis, the Au-thor's/Sponsor 's Statement of Intent provided in part, 111 \"[c]hanges in federal law have made the Texas Health Insurance Pool (THIP) unne cessary. \" See Exhibit B, which is a true and correct copy of the Senate Research Center Bill Analysis for SB 1367, dated July 18, 2013. 14. Under Section 2 of the bill, the Commissioner approved the Texas Health Insurance Pool 's plan of dissolution under t he Commissioner 's Order No. 2990, dated February 10, 2014. See Exhibit C attached, which is a true and correct copy of Commissioner 's Or- der No. 2990, dated February 10, 2014. The Commis- sioner acknowledged the completion of the dissolution effective Septemb er 1, 2015, by letter dated August 26, 2015. See Exhibit D attached, which is a true and cor- rect copy of the letter discharging the Texas Health Insurance Pool Board of Directors, dated August 26, 2015. Activity Involving Complaints 15. TDI regulated fully insured individual and group health plans. TDI 's Consumer Protection Sec- tion (Consumer Protection) receives and resolves com- plaints. Insurance Code 521 sets out the requirements for consumer information and complaints at TDI. In-surance Code \u00a7 521.002 prov ides that TDI establish a program to facilitate resolution of policyholder com-plaints. The program applies to insurers and generally to HMOs. Further, Insurance Code \u00a7 521.051 states, in part, that TDI must maintain a toll -free telephone number to receive and aid in resolving complaints against insurers. 16. As part of the process, TDI must provide, through TDI 's toll -free telephone number, information related to the number and disposition of justified, ver- ified and documented as valid complaints received; the 112 rating of an insurer, if any, as published by a nation- ally recognized rating organization; the kinds of cov- erage available to a consumer through any insurer writing insurance in this state; an insurer 's admitted assets- to-liabilities ratio; and other appropriate infor- mation collected and maintained by TDI as found, in part, under Insurance Code \u00a7 521.052. 17. TDI regulates the processing and settlement of claims under Insurance Code Chapter 542. Insur-ance Code \u00a7 542.002 provides that Subchapter A of In-surance Code Chapter 542, the Unfair Claim Settlement Practices Act, applies to a life, health, or accident insurance company, in addition to other types of insurers. Insurance Code \u00a7 843.051(a) makes HMOs subject to the Act as well. Insurance Code \u00a7 542.0 05 defines a complaint as any written communication pri- marily expressing a grievance. Under Insurance Code \u00a7 542.008, TDI must establish a system for receiving and processing individual complaints alleging a viola-tion of Subchapter A of Insurance Code Chap ter 542. 18. In addition, Insurance Code Chapter 843 pro- vides regulatory authority with respect to HMOs, in-cluding who a complainant is, what a complaint is, and when to submit a complaint to TDI. A complaint under Insurance Code \u00a7 843.002(6), in part, \" means any dis- satisfaction expressed orally or in writing by a com- plainant to a[n] [HMO] regarding any aspect of the [HMO 's] operation. \" Insurance Code \u00a7 843.002(5) pro- vides that a complainant is \" an enrollee, or a physi- cian, provider, or other person designa ted to act on behalf of an enrollee, who file a complaint. \" 19. Insurance Coe \u00a7 843.282 requires TDI to ac- cept complaints alleging certain violations of Insur-ance Code Chapter 843 and other laws in the Insurance Code by \" [a]ny person, including a person 113 who has attempted to resolve a complaint through [an HMO 's] complaint system process and is dissatisfied with the resolution. \" 20. The following is based on information con- veyed to me from Consumer Protection staff. Con- sumer Protection receives complaints from consumers and provides, such as physicians and hospitals, involv-ing claims for healthcare services. Consumer Protec- tion maintains a database tracking system for complaints. The system uses codes to track the type of health coverage involved in the compl aint. Consumer Protection collected data on healthcare complaints for the calendar years 2010 through 2017, showing the number of complaints involving qualified health plans, under the Affordable Care Act (ACA Com- plaints) as summarized in the following tab le: Calendar Year No. of ACA Complaints 2010 - 2011 - 2012 - 2013 - 2014 824 2015 1,483 2016 2,117 2017 1,107 I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the foregoing is true and correct. 114 Executed on 2 4 April 2018. /s/ Jamie Walker Jamie Walker Assistant Deputy Commissioner Texas Department of Insurance 115 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS FORT WORTH DIVISION ________ Civil Action No. 4:18 -cv-000167-O TEXAS , ET AL ., Plaintiffs , v.

Overall, OCI performs a variety of tasks to protect insurance consumers and ensure a competitive insurance environment, including: a. Reviewing insurance policies that are sold in Wisconsin to make sure they meet the re- quirements set forth in Wisconsin law ; b. Conducting examinations of domestic and foreign insurers to ensure compliance with Wisconsin laws and rules; 116 c. Monitoring the financial solvency of li- censed companies to make sure that con- sumers have the insurance coverage they expect when they need it; d. Issuing licenses to the various parties in- volved in selling and marketing insurance products; e. Assisting insurance consumers with their insurance problems; f. Researching special insurance issues to un- derstand and assess their impact on Wis- consin; g. Providing technical assistance on legisla- tion and promulgating administrative rules to interpret insurance laws; h. Creating and distributing public infor- mation and consumer education pieces to educate people about insurance; and i. Operating a state l ife insurance fund, a property fund for the property owned by lo-cal units of government, and a patients compensation fund insuring health care providers for medical malpractice. 3. As Commissioner, I am the head of OCI and the chief regulator of insurance in Wisconsin. Gener- ally, my official duties include supervising the entire agency, serving as final adjudicator of all administra- tive actions, and serving on various councils and com-mittees in a variety of capacities. 4. Additionally, my official duties w ith OCI in- clude studying the impact of the Affordable Care Act (hereinafter \" the ACA, \" or \"the Act \") on Wisconsin 's in- surance market, ensuring Wisconsin' s compliance 117 with the Act, advising the Wisconsin Governor 's Office on the ACA, and developing strategi es for Wisconsin to mitigate the numerous harms the Act has inflicted on Wisconsin health- insurance markets. 5. A member of my office has testified in front of Congress about the negative effects of the Affordable Care Act on Wisconsin 's health -insurance m arket. 1 Briefly, this testimony explained that Wisconsin had competitive individual and small group health -insur- ance markets before the ACA, which were signifi- cantly harmed by the ACA. HARMS CAUSED BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT 6. The Affordable Care Act inf licts numerous harms on Wisconsin and its citizens, as detailed below. Specifically, the Act inflicts harms on Wisconsin as a regulator of the health -insurance market. 7. The Act inflicts harms on Wisconsin because, as a result of the Act 's individual mar ket reforms many failings, Wisconsin was forced to enact state - level individual market reforms to stabilize this mar-ket. a. Because of the ACA' s burdensome regula- tions, many insurers in Wisconsin have left the individual market, scaled back their of-ferings in the individual market, or other- wise limited their exposure in the individual market. For those insurers still selling in the individual market, their prod- ucts have become much more expensive. 1 This testimony may be found at http://docs.house.gov/ meetings/IF/IF14/20170202/105506/HHRG -115-IF14 -Wstate - WieskeJ -20170202.pdf. 118 Premiums have risen since the ACA was enacted . In 2017, average pre- mium rates rose 17%, and in 2018 they in-creased by 42%. b. As a result, the Wisconsin Legislature passed a reinsurance program in February 2018 to stabilize the individual market. See Wisconsin State Legislature, Senate Bill 770; 2 Governor Scott Walker, Press Re- lease, Governor Walker Proposes Health Care Stability Plan to Stabilize Premiums for Wisconsinites on Obamacare (Jan 21, 2018);3 Governor Scott Walker, Memo Ac- companying Jan. 21, 2018 Press Re- lease;4Bob Lang, Legislative Fisca l Bureau Memo Accompanying Assembly Bill 885/Senate Bill 770 (Feb. 12, 2018).5 c. Wisconsin 's reinsurance program is neces- sary because the ACA 's regulations of the individual market have caused health -in- surance premiums to rise substantially. Without W isconsin 's intervention, plans in the individual market would either not be offered, or would be prohibitively ical_assistance_lapse_2_12_18.pdf 119 d. This reinsurance program proposal costs an estimated $200 million, split between state and federal funds. e. The reinsurance plan c annot be imple- mented without federal approval through a Section 1332 State Innovation Waiver; a process involving drafting of the applica-tion, staff travel, and presentation prepara- tion for required public hearings, OCI funds to support actuarial analysis required for inclusion in the application, and adminis- trative expenses necessary to operate the program. 8. As mentioned above, the Act forced Wisconsin insurers out of the individual market and/or all health -insurance markets. a. For example, a major Wisc onsin health in- surer, Assurant Health, ceased its Wiscon-sin operations because of the ACA. See , e.g., Guy Boulton, Milwaukee -based Assurant Health to be sold off or shut down , Milwau- kee Journal Sentinel (Apr. 28, 2015). 6 This cost Wisconsin 1,200 jobs. Id . b. This contributes to the harms to the indi-vidual market, as mentioned above. As some health insurers have stopped using agents to sell individual health insurance products and have left the market alto-gether, therefore no longer needing agents, the AC A has also resulted in OCI collecting less revenue in health insurance -related 6 30161425l.html. 120 agent licensing fees. Agents licensed to sell insurance in Wisconsin must pay an initial fee of $75.00 along with an application fee of $10.00. See Wis. Stat. \u00a7 628.04(l)(a); Wis. indi- viduals as agents, reinsurance intermediar-ies, or managing general agents \"). A licensing fee of $100 and a biennial license renewal fee of $35.00 also applies to some firms. See Wis. Stat. \u00a7 628.04(l)(a); Wis. Admin. Code Ins. \u00a7 6.58(3), (5). 9. The Act creates an unsustainable insurance market, which will ultimately raise Medicaid reim- bursement rates. a. As the ACA causes insurers to leave the marketplace, more individuals will be una- ble to obtain insurance coverage. b. These individuals will ultimately receive uncompensated medical care via hospital emergency rooms. See generally 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(A), (F), (I) (describing this prob- lem). c. To compensate for this uncompensated care, health -care provid ers will raise their rates on compensated services, thus requir- ing the State to reimburse more money for Medicaid -paid services. 10. The Act harms Wisconsin because it preempted Wisconsin law, preventing Wisconsin from regulating the Wisconsin health -insur ance market in the manner it sees fit. Relatedly, Wisconsin repealed statutes and regulations related to its high risk pool, a safety net for individuals with high health care 121 needs. See infra , \u00b6 10.a. Without the ACA, Wisconsin could enforce these preempted laws and rules to re- turn stability to the health -insurance market. a. The ACA resulted in the repeal of Wiscon- sin's high -risk pool, the Health Insurance Risk -Sharing Plan, which effectively man- aged the health -insurance needs of high - risk individuals before the full implementa- tion of the ACA. Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 149.10 -.53 (2011- 12) (statutory framework for Wiscon- sin Health Insurance Risk -Sharing Plan), repealed by 2013 Wis. Act 20, \u00a7 1900n; see generally Wisconsin Legislative Audit Bu- reau, Report 14 -7 Heal th Insurance Risk - Sharing Plan Authority at 1 (June 2014) (describing history of Wisconsin 's Health Insurance Risk -Sharing Plan, including dissolution and repeal).7 b. The ACA preempted Wisconsin law relating to coverage for preventive services. Wiscon- sin insurance law allows for cost -sharing for preventative services. See OCI, Bulle- tin, September 3, 2010, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009 (hereinaf- ter \"OCI Bulletin \"); 8 Wis. Stat. \u00a7 632.895 (describing Wisconsin coverage mandates, which W isconsin had interpreted to permit cost-sharing). The ACA does not allow such cost sharing. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg -13. c. The ACA preempted Wisconsin law on the treatment of preexisting conditions. Under 7 http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lab/reports/14 -7full.p df. 8 https://oci.wi.gov/Pages/Regulation/Bulletin20100903PPACA .aspx. 122 Wisconsin insurance law, preexisting con- dition exclusions were permitted for a 12 - month period. See OCI Bulletin; Wis. Stat. \u00a7 632.76(2)(ac). The ACA 's conflicting rules on preexisting conditions increase the cost of health insurance. d. The ACA preempted Wisconsin fraud rules. Under Wisconsin insuranc e law, rescission in cases of fraudulent misrepresentation, including negligent misrepresentations, was permitted. See OCI Bulletin; Wis. Stat. \u00a7 632.76(1). The ACA allows rescission when fraudulent See OCI Bulleti n; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg -12. The imposes other costs, burdens, and re- quirements on OCI: a. The Act forces OCI to expend significant amounts of money on compliance and edu-cation costs. For example, in 2013 OCI spent a significant amount of resources on state -wide information -sharing town halls for the public. b. In preparation to comply with the ACA for the 2018 plan year, OCI held multiple calls with insurers to provide direction on the fil- ing of their rates. With congressional un- certainty and ultima tely a decision resulting in the federal government no longer funding cost sharing reduction sub- sidies (CSRs), OCI had to revise timelines and expectations around rate filings and communicate those expectations verbally and in writing. 123 12. Finally, without the ACA, OCI could allow in- surers to operate under a set of rules that creates cer- tainty and stability for market growth while protecting consumers and offering them affordable ac-cess to individual health insurance coverage. Under the ACA, OCI has limite d flexibility in regulating the individual market and is forced to react to the impli- cations federal rules have on the Wisconsin market. As mentioned earlier, an example of that reaction is addressing a destabilizing market with between $30-50 million gen eral purpose revenue to support a $200 million state based reinsurance plan.

My name i s Arlene Larson, I am the Manager of Federal Health Programs and Policy at the Wiscon- sin Department of Employee Trust Funds ( \"ETF\" ). My duties generally include health insurance policy and contract analysis and implementation. 2. ETF is responsible for ad ministering retire- ment, insurance, and other benefit programs for State and participating Local government employees and re- tirees of the Wisconsin Retirement System. ETF per- forms a variety of tasks to satisfy this responsibility. The Group Insurance Boar d (\"Board \") enters into con- tracts to provide the State Group Health Insurance Program. 125 3. Additionally, my official duties with ETF in- clude ensuring the State 's group health insurance pro- gram complies with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (he reinafter \"the ACA, \" or \"the Act\"). WISCONSIN 'S STATE -EMPLOYEE HEALTH IN- SURANCE PLANS AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT 'S EFFECTS 4. Below is basic information about the State 's employees (and their family members) enrolled in the State 's group health insurance program: a. There are an estimated 167,500 state em-ployees (and their family members) en-rolled in the State 's group health insurance program. The employee contribution amount appears in the grid, below. It var-ies between regular State employees and the University of Wisconsin (UW) graduate assistants. It further varies based upon the benefit selected by the employee. Most em- ployees choose a vendor that offers the \" It's Your Choice Health Plan. \" \"It's Your Choice Health Plan. \" 126 b. For 2017, ETF estimates that the State spent the amounts below on the state -em- ployee group health insurance program. c. Additionally, there are administrative tasks performed by state employees to en- roll each employee in the group health in- surance program. 5. The Act required the Board to modify the State 's group health insurance program to State em- ployees: a. The Board enhanced an existing health - care benefit for State employees to comply with the essential -health -benefits require- ments. Preventive care is required to be paid at 100% under the ACA. b. The Act lowered limits on employee flexible health spending accounts. I am aware that every year ETF reviews the limits to be cer- tain we comply with requirements. 6. The ACA' s Market Share Fee, ACA \u00a7 9010, may have financial imp act on the State 's group health insurance program in the future. a. Beginning in 2015, ETF and the Board be- gan an intensive investigation into moving from a fully insured model to a self -insur- ance model for the State group health in- surance program. This i nvestigation included working with the Board 's consult- ing agency, Segal Consulting (Segal), which 127 issued reports to the board. To date, Segal is the Board 's consulting actuary and for- mer benefit consultant. b. This investigation was motivated in part to find a means to avoid the Act 's Market Share fees of approximately 2% of health premiums, per Segal 's March 25, 2015 re- port to the Board. Segal 's reports are pub- licly available on ETF 's website. I am aware that in 2015, Congress approved a moratorium on c ollection insurer taxes for 2017. The moratorium was set to expire in 2018. During annual health plan negotia-tions regarding 2018 rates, participating health plans were limited in their 2017 ad- ministrative fee increases. Per Segal 's Au- gust 30, 2017 repo rt to the Board, no consideration was given to additional ACA fees currently projected for 2018. The State group health insurance program ultimately did not change to self -insurance, and in- stead the Board explored cost reductions in other areas. 7. The AC A's 40% excise tax, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980I, may have a financial impact on the State 's group health insurance program if enacted. This tax is trig- gered when the cost of plans offered by an employer exceeds a certain value. a. The Segal reports to the Board, referenced above, also addressed the potential effect of the ACA' s excise tax on the State 's group health insurance program. b. The federal government has delayed the en-forcement of the excise tax for specific 128 years, but the State 's group health insur- ance program may be liable to pay the 40% tax if it is imposed as written. c. If the 40% excise tax is enforced, ETF and the Board will dedicate time and resources during its annual process to review options to avoid or minimize the impact of the ex-cise tax. d. Segal annually provides benefit alternative calculation estimates to ETF and the Board. If the 40% excise tax is enforced, Segal will provide calculations for options to the State 's group health insurance pro- gram to minimize or avoid the tax. 8. The ACA im poses other costs and require- ments on ETF: a. The ACA has required ETF to comply with the requirements surrounding IRS Form 1095- C for some retirees in the State' s group health insurance program adminis- tered by ETF. In 2017, ETF hired a vendor to issue 34 3 Form 1095- Cs. b. ETF has had to dedicate some agency re- sources to studying the ACA and ensuring the State 's compliance with the ACA. For example, ETF coordinated with other state agencies and local government municipali- ties to discuss the potential impact of the employer shared responsibility penalty. These discussions focused primarily on the possibility of employers failing to offer health insurance premium contributions to full-time employees prior to the 91st day af- ter the employee' s hire date. 129 I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET JIM L. RIDL ING, ALABAMA COMMISSIONER OF INSURANCE _______ My name is Jim L. Ridling and I am over the age of 18 and fully competent to make this declaration and state the following: 1. I am Commissioner of the Alabama Depart- ment of Insurance (ALD OI). I have served as Com- missioner of ALDOI for over nine (9) years. As Commissioner, I am the head of the ALDOI and the chief insurance regulator for the state of Alabama. Generally, my official duties include supervising the entire agency, serving as final adjudicator of all ad- ministrative actions, and serving on various commis-sions, councils, and committees in a variety of capacities. 2. ALDOI is responsible for regulating the busi- ness of insurance in the state of Alabama. As a part of these responsibilities, ALDOI performs a variety of tasks that are designed to protect insurance consum- 131 ers while ensuring a competitive insurance environ- ment. Included among the duties and responsibilities are the following: a. Licensing insurance companies and con- ducting regular examinations of domestic insurers, and as necessary foreign insurers, to ensure compliance with Alabama laws and rules. b. Monitoring the financial solvency of li-censed insurers to make sure that consum-ers will be provided the insurance coverag e they have paid for when they need it. c. Reviewing and approving all insurance pol-icies to make sure they meet the require- ments of Alabama law. d. Licensing the insurance producers and var- ious other representatives of the insurers. e. Assisting insurance consumers with any problems they may experience with their insurance policies. f. Providing technical assistance on legisla-tion and adopting administrative rules to implement and interpret insurance laws. 3. Included within all the duties and responsibil- ities is the regulation of the health insurance market, and in particular the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on Alabama 's health insurance market, ensur- ing compliance of the ACA in Alabama, advising the Alabama Governor 's office on the ACA, and to gener- ally develop strategies for the State of Alabama to mit-igate the numerous harms the ACA has inflicted on the health insurance markets in the State of Alabama. 132 4. In particular, the ACA has inflicted numerous harms on Alabama and its citizens, as follo ws: a. First, a stated goal of the ACA was to in- crease competition, as expressed by Presi-dent Obama in an address to Congress on September 9, 2009, where he said Alabama lacked competition because one carrier had almost 90% of the market. 1 Because of the ACA' s burdensome regulations, many in- surers in Alabama have left the insurance market or scaled backed their exposure so that there is actually less competition for the individuals within the health insurance market to choose from. Instead of fostering competition, Alabama has seen the exact opposite within its borders when it comes to the ACA' s effect on the insurance market. After four years of the ACA, that one com-pany had 100% of the individual health in-surance market. b. Another stated goal of the ACA was to re-duce the rates paid for health insurance. The embedded mandates through the es- sential health benefits requirement in the ACA have added to the health insurer costs in the market, putting upward premium pressure on insurers in the Alabama mar- ket for policies in this State. On March 23, 2010 when President Obama signed the ACA into law, an individual aged 52 could purchase a major medical insurance policy for $203 per month. On January 1, 2018, a 1 http://blog.al.com/live/2009/09/obama_cited_lack_of_ competitiv.html 133 comparable Obama Care policy for a 52 year old wa s $829, an increase of 308%, or 19% per year. c. The ACA has had a disastrous effect on the number of insurers within the state regard- ing the federal risk adjustment within the individual and small group markets. The stated goal again was to increase comp eti- tion by stabilizing premiums. Here are the results of the risk adjustments for the first three years under ACA: 2014: One insurer collected $2,544,517, four other insurers collected a total of $246,858, and six insurers paid a total of $2,791,376. 2 2015: One insurer collected $15,326,641, two other insurers collected a total of $104,889, and seven insurers paid a total of $15,431,531. 3 2016: One insurer collected $27,243,856 and seven insurers paid a total of $27,243,856, (including default pay-ments). report for 2017 is due this sum- mer. It is anticipated the transfers will be sharply reduced due to the fact that only one insurer remains in the individ-ual market. d. Finally, the ACA harms Alabama because it preempted Alabama law, thus preven ting Alabama from regulating the Alabama health insurance market in the manner it deems most appropriate to the Alabama sit-uation. Without the ACA, Alabama could again enforce preempted laws and rules to return stability to the health insurance market. 5.

AID is responsible for regulating the Arkansas health -insurance market and protecting consumers of the ma rket. Overall, AID performs a variety of tasks to protect insurance consumers and ensure a competi- tive insurance environment, including: a. Reviewing insurance policies that are sold in Arkansas to make sure they meet the re- quirements set forth in Arkansas law; b.

The embedded mandates through essential health benefits requirements in the ACA have added to health insurer costs in this market putting upward premium pressure on insurers in the Arkansas mar- ket for issuers offering individual and small group pol-icies in this State. We estimate that since the inception of the Arkansas health insurance exchange in 2014, the percentage increase in premium in the in- dividual market from the first year of the Exchange to today is approximately 24%. 6. The Act adds costs to health insurers in bene- fit requirements, underwriting and in reporting, and this negatively impacts the number of issuers in the health insurance exchange we provide for individual and small group policies. For example, as a result of the ACA costs, several years ago, United Health Care withdrew from participation in the Arkansas ex- change, thereby reducing competition and the number of insurers offering individual policies in this State. 7. Finally, the Act harms Arkansas because it has preempted Arkansas law, preventing Arkansas from regulating health insurance in the manner it sees fit. 8.

I am the Director of the Kansas State Em- ployee Health Plan (SEHP). S EHP administers the various insurance plans available to Kansas state em- ployees and participating non -state entities (such as school districts, cities or counties). SEHP is part of the Division of Health Care Finance, a division within the Kansas Departmen t of Health and Environment. I have served with SEHP for over 10 years. 2. I am particularly familiar with the SEHP changes in costs, plans, and policies required to com-ply with requirements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). 139 3. At my direction, SEHP staff have prepared the attached spreadsheet that answers questions posed to SEHP concerning the impact of ACA. 4. As the spreadsheet details, I estimate that the overall impact of ACA on SEHP operations to be addi-tional costs of $44,410,997 spread over the year s of 2013 to 2018 inclusive. 5. The three largest categories of ACA costs are: a. Plan changes to cover out -of-pocket maxi- mums - $14,006,000; b. Plan changes to cover individual mandate - $10,559,000; and c. ACA fees for transitional reinsurance - $9,520,452. 6. SEHP is currently in its design stage for the 2019 Plan year. If ACA were to be eliminated, this would affect the 2019 Plan by decreasing costs for com- pliance. This could potentially affect the insurance rates charged to SEHP participants. 7. Pursua nt to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and cor-rect. Respectfully submitted this the 24 day of April , 2018. /s/ Mike Michael Mike Michael Director Kansas State Employee Health Plan 140 i. What impact does has the ACA had on each agency's budgeting?

Out of Pocket Maximum Type of cost $90,591 Grand Total ii. How would a complete repeal of ACA tomor- row affect how policy and other decisions are made for next year? This would allow the plan to discuss preventative, age 26, DME limits, out of pocket limits and etc. to poten-tially modify to meet the needs of the state. This would also eliminate additional costs s uch as PCORI fees and tax reporting of 1094/1095. \"In other words: are you currently making plans regarding benefits/policy for next year, and, if so, what impact would repeal of the ACA have on the decision -making that is currently happening? We are currently in discussions about plan design for 2019. If repealed sooner would allow discussions for plan design and potentially lower the plan costs. Would repeal of the ACA now allow your agen-cies to be more flexible in the decision it makes for next year? This would allow us to discuss options about preven- tive, age 26 removing DME limits and out of pocket maximums. If repealed sooner would allow discus-sions for 2019 versus 2020. Would it grant your agencies greater authority in making decisions regarding b enefits and health care than it currently has? Yes What benefit would it be to your agencies (es-pecially to its ability to make plans regarding budget, policy, etc.) to have the ACA appealed now as opposed to much later in the year or even next year? 144 It would allow discussions of greater options and be able to potentially reduce costs such as PCORI fees and 1094/1095 reporting. iii. How does your spending/budgeting under ACA compare to prior to the implementation of the ACA? Because of the increase in cost for ACA, it has required more revenue by the employer and employee to cover the increased costs. 145 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS FORT WORTH DIVISION ________ Civil Action No. 4:18 -cv-000167-O TEXAS , ET AL ., Plaintiffs , v.

Snyder and I am over the age of 18 and fully competent to make this dec laration and state the following: 1. I am the Executive Director for the Mississippi Division of Medicaid (DOM). DOM administers Medi- caid at the state level to residents of Mississippi. Mis- sissippi Medicaid serves: (1) Low Pregnant women; (4) Elders; and (5) Peo- ple with disabilities. As result of the ACA, an addi-tional category was added to this list to include individuals under age 26, who aged out of foster care in the state and who were enrolled in Medicaid while in fo ster care. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(IX) (West); Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. 111- 148, 124 Stat. 865, \u00a7 2004. 2. Financial eligibility for Medicaid and many other social programs is based on a family 's income 146 level as compared to the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). The FPL is intended to identify the minimum amount of income a family would need to meet very basic fam- ily needs. 3. Medicaid is funded by both the state and fed- eral governments. The federal share of Medicaid funds Mississippi receives is based on the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The FMAP is calcu- lated annually using each state 's per capita personal income in relation to the U.S. average. Generally, Mis- sissippi receives an FMAP of approximately 75%, meaning the federal/state s hare of Medicaid funding is around 75/25 for most client services. 4. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\" ) in 2010, DOM 's ability to manage Medicaid coverage to Mississippi residents has been signifi- cantly restricted. The regulations imposed by the ACA result in substantial burden to DOM both administra- tively and financially. Administrative & Policy Burdens Under the ACA 5. Prior to the passing of the ACA, DOM used several factors to determine eligibility for Medicaid for families and children including: (1) Family income; (2) age; (3) relationship; (4) other categorical factors, such as being pregnant or disabled. 1 Prior to the ACA DOM had the option to review eligibility criteria for adult enrollees more frequently than 12 months. 6. With the passing of the ACA, DOM was no longer given the flexibility to verify a Mississippi resi-dent' s eligibility based on these factors. Instead, the 1 Individuals receiving SSI cash assistance were and still are au- tomatically eligible for Medicaid. 147 ACA expanded \" mandatory \" populations for Medicaid programs, wherein Mississippi was required to pro- vide them Medicaid regardless of actual financial sta- tus. See Pub. L. 111- 148, 124 Stat. 271, \u00a7 2002. Specifically, in Mississippi the coverage for for-mer foster children was raised from 21 years old to 26 years old. The ACA also mandated DOM use Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) to determine eligibil- ity. 2 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a(e)(14) (West). In other words, the tax filing rules are now the primary consideration used to determine income and household composition for purposes of Medicaid eligibility. Income that i s not taxable cannot be considered. 7. The restrictions placed upon DOM when it evaluates eligibility for Medicaid means that DOM is forced to ignore many factors relevant to an individ-ual's ability to obtain health insurance for himself or herself. As a r esult, the ACA caused a rise in the num- ber of Mississippi residents enrolled in Medicaid. 8. The ACA also imposed changes to the Medi- caid and CHIP renewal process. Pursuant to the ACA, eligibility redeterminations are now allowed no more frequently than once per 12 months, unless the enrol- lee volunteers to DOM that there is a change that af- fects eligibility. This change mandated by the ACA restrains the frequency with which DOM can identify persons no longer eligible for Medicaid and remove them from the ro lls, thus limiting the ability of the agency to fully review whether an adult continues to be eligible. The ACA 's individual mandate contributed 2 MAGI applies to pregnant women, children and families, but does not apply to individuals who are elderly or wh o have disa- bilities. 148 to the expansion of the Medicaid population in Missis- sippi as well. As a result of the individual mandate, Miss issippi residents were required to seek health care coverage, on penalty of paying a fine to the federal government. Efforts to avoid imposition of the fine likely prompted more individuals to seek Medicaid from DOM. 9. Although it is difficult to quantif y the exact number of Medicaid enrollees that can be attributed to the individual mandate, I am confident that the indi-vidual mandate played a substantial role in the in- crease in the number of Medicaid recipients since 2011. This assertion is based on my e xperience with DOM and the research I have participated in to pre- pare reports to the Mississippi legislature. 10. New requirements pursuant to the ACA re- garding non -Mississippi residents and illegal aliens also increased the number of persons receiving Med i- caid benefits in Mississippi. While non -residents and illegal aliens are not (and have never been) required to be provided full Medicaid benefits by DOM, the ACA did create a new mandate requiring that DOM allow them to apply for Medicaid by simply assert ing that they are in a qualified alien status and qualified to re-ceive benefits. Pursuant to the ACA, this mere asser-tion from an individual imposes a duty upon DOM to provide him or her benefits for up to 90 days while he or she is given the opportunity t o verify their citizen- ship or alien status. This imposition by the ACA re- sulted in an increase of persons covered by Medicaid through DOM. 11. The ACA also forced DOM to expand Medicaid coverage by mandating that DOM initially accept a hospital 's determina tion of a person 's eligibility for 149 Medicaid. 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(47). If a hospital con- cludes that an individual is eligible for Medicaid, the ACA requires DOM to provide him or her Medicaid for two months while DOM makes its own eligibility de-termination. This increased the number of persons re- ceiving Medicaid benefits through DOM at any given time by forcing DOM to provide two months of benefits to many individuals who would not have been ap- proved by DOM as an original matter. In addition to this numerical increase imposed by the ACA, this mandate also required DOM to build new systems to accommodate this requirement. These efforts required the investment of administrative resources, time, and money that could have been spent in other ways that benefitted t he state. 12. The ACA also mandates the specific Medicaid services Mississippi is required to cover. Rather than allowing DOM to make such determinations based on the needs of Mississippi 's population, the ACA im- posed a \"one- size-fits-all\" erning the provision of inpatient hospital services, outpatient hospital services, family planning services and supplies, federally qualified health centers, nurse midwife services, certified pediatric and family nurse practitioner services, home health care services, med- ical transportation services, nursing facility services for individuals 21 or over, rural health clinic services, and other significant and complex medical services and systems. 13. The ACA expands Medicaid coverage for adults unde r age 65 (up to 133% FPL, or rather up to 138% FPL with a 5% income disregard). 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII); (e)(14)(I)(i) (West). How-ever, subsidies are available to adults through the Ex-change beginning at 100% FPL. 150 14. As a cumulative result of these mandates, rules, and restrictions imposed by the ACA, DOM 's Medicaid caseload has increased since implementa- tion of the ACA. Since the ACA' s implementation in 2014, Mississippi has expanded its Medicaid recipi- ents from 2013 year end enrollment of 715,979 to a current enrollment of 739,082 in March 2018. Costs Incurred Under the ACA 15. Medicaid Cost is determined by the Caseload - the volume or number of individuals served in each category - and Cost per Client - a function of the num- ber, type, and cost of the services a client receives, and how those services are provided. 16. Given the increase in caseloads as a direct re- sult of the ACA 's enactment, state spending on Medi- caid has increased dramatically following the ACA 's implementation. 17. Beginning in January 2014, DOM was re- quired to pay an annual excise tax to the federal gov-ernment known as the Heath Insurer Tax. See Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. 111- 148, 124 Stat. 865, \u00a7 9010. The tax is based on the amount of health in- surance premiums col lected. HIT will continue to in- crease with premium growth. In the FY 2017, DOM paid a total of $43,504,254 in this tax. 18. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and cor-rect.

I have personal knowledge of the matters and information set for th herein. Missouri Department of Social Services 4. The Missouri Department of Social Services administers Medicaid at the state level to residents of Missouri. 152 5. Financial eligibility for Medicaid and other so- cial p rograms is based on a household 's inco me level as compared to the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Mis- souri uses multiple FPL percentages for different Medicaid coverage types, dependent upon the pro-gram. 6. Medicaid is funded by both the state and fed- eral governments. The federal share of Medicai d funds Missouri receives is based on the Federal Medical As-sistance Percentage (FMAP). The FMAP is calcu lated annually using each state 's per capita personal income in relation to the U.S. average. Generally, Missouri re-ceives an FMAP of 64.61%, meaning t he federal/state share of Medicaid funding is around 65/35 for most medical services for FFY 2018. 7. Missouri did not adopt the full Medicaid ex- pansion, the regulations imposed by the ACA result in substantial burden to Missouri Department of Social Servi ces both administratively and financially. 8. Missouri 's Medicaid caseload (the number of individuals enrolled in the Medicaid eligibility groups) increased from 881,719 for January 2013 to 969,049 for March 2018. Administrative Changes to Medicaid Eligib ility Under the ACA 9. Missouri Medicaid serves: (1) Low -income families; (2) Children; (3) Pregnant women; (4) El- derly; and (5) Persons with disabilities. As a result of the ACA, an additional category was added to this list to include individuals under a ge 26, who aged out of foster care in the state and who were enrolled in Med-icaid while in foster care. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(IX) ; Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. 111-148, 124 Stat. 865, \u00a7 2004. 153 10. Before the ACA, Missouri did not offer Medi- caid to this full group of former foster care children under age 26. 11. Prior to the ACA, the Missouri Department of Social Services used several factors to determine eligi- bility for Medicaid including: (1) Family income; (2) age; (3) assets; (4) other factor s such as being pregnant or disabled.1 12. ACA restricted the Missouri Department of Social Services to consider only a sole financial factor to determine eligibility: Modified Adjusted Gross In- come (MAGI). 2 42 U .S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a(e)(14). In other words, IRS tax filing rules are now the only permissi- ble consideration used to determine income and house- hold composition for purposes of Medicaid eligibility. Other income, such as child support and Social Secu-rity income for children whose total income falls below an IRS determined threshold, is not considered. Be- cause the ACA left no choice to states but to accept these new criteria, Missouri approved the use of MAGI by SB 127 (2013) beginning in January 2014. 13. The change to MAGI complicated the admin- istration o f the program because the eligibility criteria differ from those used for other social service pro- grams. Under the ACA, Missouri built a new eligibility system to process MAGI Medicaid, which was costly and complicated. Under ACA, open enrollment is once 1 Individuals receiving SSI cash assistance were and still are au- tomatically eligible for Medicaid. 2 MAGI applies to pregnant women, children and families, but does not apply to individuals who are elderly or who have disa- bilities. 154 per year. During the open enrollment period the De- partment receives an additional 10,000 to 15,000 ap- plications per month. The ACA 's individual mandate increased Mis- souri 's Medicaid enrollment 14. The ACA also included an individual mandate. Missouri reside nts were required to seek health care coverage or pay a penalty to the federal government. 15. Although it is difficult to quantify the exact number of Medicaid enrollees that can be attributed to the ACA, during the time period the ACA was imple-mented the Medicaid caseload increased, see numbers above. 16. The ACA also mandates the specific Medicaid services Missouri is required to cover. Costs Incurred Under the ACA 17. Medicaid Cost is determined by the Caselo ad - the volume or number of individuals serv ed in each category - and Cost per Client - a function of the num- ber, type, and cost of the services a client receives, and how those services are provided. 18. Given the increase in caseloads state spending on Medicaid has increased following the ACA 's imple- mentation. With the increase in caseload, the com- bined state share of Medicaid Administration and Assistance increased from $3,516,957,427 in FFY 2013 to $3,851,597,485 in FFY 2017. 19.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET _______ DECLARATION OF JUDIT H MUCK _______ My name is Judith Muck and I am over the age of 18 and fully competen t to make this declaration and state the following: 1. I am the Executive Director of the Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan (MCHCP). I have served as Executive Director with Missouri Consoli- dated Health Care Plan for 5 years. 2. As the Executive Direc tor for Missouri Consol- idated Health Care Plan, I am responsible for the day - to-day operations of the health plan. 3. I am familiar with the business of MCHCP, with the storage of records in the MCHCP and with changes in costs, plans and policies related to the en- actment of the ACA. 4. I have personal knowledge of the matters and information set forth herein except where noted. 157 The Missouri Consolidated Health Plans 5. The Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan is a non -federal governmental health plan whic h pro- vides insurance coverage for most state employees as specified in Chapter 10 of the Revised Statutes of Mis- souri. Missouri statutes grants to the MCHCP Board of Trustees (the Board) the general administration and the responsibility for the proper operation of the plan. 103.008 RSMo. 6. Under Section 103.014, the Board appoints an Executive Director who has charge of the offices, rec-ords and employees of the plan, subject to the discre- tion of the board. 7. The Board, upon recommendations of the Ex- ecutiv e Director of the MCHCP, sets benefits and pre- miums each year for the next plan year. Taken into consideration when designing the coverage are bene- fits and limits that are mandated by law, both federal and state. 8. Per 103.100 RSMo, every year MCHCP actu- arially estimates the cost based on the plan design chosen by the Board and sends an overall cost to pro-vide benefits to the Office of Administration. The gov- ernor makes a recommendation and the legislature passes the funding at the level it approves. MCHCP 's budget is contained in the Office of Administration 's budget as an employee benefit. Financial Costs Associated with ACA Regula- tions 9. With the passing of the ACA Missouri Consol- idated Health Care Plan has been affected with new administrative and fina ncial requirements. 158 10. These requirements are described in the at- tached chart that was used by the MCHCP which was prepared by our employees shortly after state FY 2017, and updated as needed to summarize the histor-ical and projected impact of the ACA on the MCHCP. This chart was made and kept in the ordinary course of business. This chart was made by assembling the data available to MCHCP in its computerized account- ing system, data warehouse, actuarial analysis and contractual terms. This chart was found in the ordi- nary course of business and it was not prepared for purposes of litigation. The exhibit is a true copy of this chart. All fiscal years reference the state fiscal year. The state fiscal year runs from July 1, through June 30 of the subsequent yea r. Lifetime Maximum Benefit 11. At the time of passage and implementation of the ACA, MCHCP did not have a lifetime maximum benef it. \"Lifetime maximum benefit\" is the maximum dollar amount a health insurance plan will pay in ben- efits to an in sured person d uring that person' s life- time. The ACA prohibited insurance contracts nationwide from including any lifetime maximum benefit. The ACA thus, eliminated Missouri Consoli- dated Health Care Plan 's ability to choose to impose lifetime maximum benefits for essenti al health bene- fits in the future. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300 -gg-11. Young Adult Dependents 12. Prior to the implementation of the ACA on January 1, 2010, Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan provided coverage for unemancipated depend-ents up to age 25 and unemancipa ted disabled chil- dren over age 25 who are permanently and totally disabled when first eligible or covered before age 25.. 159 But the ACA requires that all health insurance cover- age nationwide provide continuing coverage for all de- pendents until the age of 26. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300 -gg-14. 13. Providing continuing health insurance cover- age for adult dependents until the age of twenty -six puts costs upon Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan because each individual insured by the Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan constitutes expenses for the system. 14. Specifically, Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan had costs of $316,382 in FY 2011, $1,080.559 in FY 2016, $2,333,801 in FY 2017. 15. Accordingly, in the six -year period between 2012 and 2017, compliance with the ACA legal man-date to insure dependents until the age of twenty -six imposed a cost of approximately $10,687,437. 16. Exact additional costs for 2018 are not yet available, but compliance with the ACA will require Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan to indefi-nitely continue paying these additional costs because the dependent age requirement mandated by the ACA remains 26, which is higher than the age that Mis- souri Consolidated Health Care Plan had adopted prior to the implantation of the ACA. 17. MCHCP estimates that these costs will be $2,203,014 in FY 2018, $2,395,552 in FY 2020, and $2,722,200 in FY 2021. Prevent ive Services 18. Prior to a doption of the ACA on January 1, 2010, Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan re- quired insured persons to pay deductible, co- insurance 160 and/or copayments for some preventive care that are now disallowed because the ACA requires that preven- tive care be cover ed at 100%. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg -13. Prior to this provision, MCHCP covered almost all rec- ommended preventive services with no cost share. Ex- amples of services not previously covered at 100% include over -the-counter tobacco cessation products with a prescript ion, vitamin D with a prescription, as- pirin with a prescription in certain situations, folic acid with a prescription in certain situations, routine prenatal care, and breast feeding support and ser- vices. Because so few services were not already cov- ered, a n actuary determined that this requirement did not impact MCHCP premiums. MCHCP lost the flexi- bility to choose not to offer these services in the future or to offer them subject to cost sharing requirements. Clinical Trials 19. Effective January 1, 2013, t he ACA requires coverage for routine patient care costs incurred as the result of a Phase I, II, III or IV clinical trial that is conducted in relation to the prevention, detection or treatment of cancer or other life- threatening disease or condition. Prio r to this provision, MCHCP covered routine patient care costs incurred as the result of Phase II, III or IV clinical trials for cancer in accord-ance with Missouri law. The actuary thus determined that this requirement did not impact MCHCP premi- ums. MCHCP l ost the flexibility to choose not to cover the expanded trial requirements in the future. Patient- Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) Fee 20. The ACA requires Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan to pay a Patient -Centered Outcomes Research Insti tute (PCORI) fee. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9511. The 161 fee applies to issuers of specified health insurance pol- icies and plan sponsors of applicable self -insured health plans to help fund the Patient -Centered Out- comes Research Institute. The fee is based on the av-erage number of lives covered under the plan. The fee applies to plan years ending on or after Oct. 1, 2012, and before Oct. 1, 2019. MCHCP makes payment in July of each year. 21. Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan paid the following for its persons enrolled in a health insur-ance plan: in FY 2014, $87,002; in 2017, $187,783. It projects to pay, assuming a 4% trend over current fee of Transitional Reinsurance Program Fee 22. The ACA requires Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan to pay the Transitional Reinsurance Program fee. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18061. Section 1341 of the ACA established a Transitional Reinsurance Program to help stabilize premiums for coverage in the individ- ual market during the years 2014 through 2016. If this requirement had not been in place, Missouri Consoli- dated Health Care Plan would have saved in FY 2018. Employer Shared Responsibility 23. Prior to the ACA, a full -time employee was de- fined as an employee who is employed at least 40 hours per week; the ACA altered that number to 30 hours per week. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4 980H; Pub. L. 111- 148, 124 Stat. 865, \u00a7 4980H(d)(4)(A). 24. This change impacted Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan by increasing the number of persons 162 the State of Missouri must insure, thus increasing the total cost of providing insurance. 25. Under the ACA, any employer with 100 (de- creases to 50 in 2016) or more fulltime equivalents (FTEs) is subject to a penalty if the employer fails to offer access to minimum essential coverage and if any FTE receives a tax credit or if the coverage does not meet minimum value and affordability requirements. 26. MCHCP coverage meets minimum value and affordability requirements. MCHCP offers coverage to all FTEs that are benefit -eligible. Effective January 1, 2015, MCHCP began offering coverage to certain var-iable h our employees who are not benefit -eligible but who worked on average more than 30 hours per week during the standard measurement period. These indi- viduals are considered an FTE employee for the pur-pose of the ACA. 27. In FY 2016, this cost $112,833 and in Estimated costs reflect MCHCP 's contribution to the premium for variable hour employees. Excise or Cadillac Tax 28. Under the ACA, a 40 percent excise tax will be assessed, beginning in 2022, on the cost of coverage for health plans that exceed a certain annual limit ($10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for self and spouse or family coverage. Limits for retiree cov- erage are higher.) Estimates are subject to further guidance through regulations not yet available. Issues that can impact the potential amount owed include 163 rate blending, age and demographic distributions, HSA/FSA contributions as well as other issues. 29. This excise tax was estimated in December 2015, to be $2.0M -$2.5M in FY 2022. The lower amount of the range is estimated based on rate blend- ing with the higher amount reflecting no rate blend- ing. The estimate given also does not include the impact of any futur e benefit design changes should they occur after the estimate was made. IRS Reporting Requirements 30. Under the ACA, MCHCP is required to report who has coverage to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) annually. MCHCP has contracted for the print-ing and mai ling of 1094B and 1095B reporting. 31. Form 1094- B is for the Transmittal of Health Coverage Information Returns. Form 1095 -B is used to report certain information to the IRS and to taxpay- ers about individuals who are covered by minimum es- sential coverage and therefore are not liable for the individual shared responsibility payment. 32. These costs are $185,061 in FY 2016 and $57,699 in FY 2017. Requirements Associated with ACA Regulations 33. Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan is currently structuring the benefits and policies for the 2019 plan year and bases its activities on knowledge of whether the ACA is still federal law in or der. 34. Without the expenses described above, Mis- souri Consolidated Health Care Plan would possibly gain back nearly $3 million in funding. This is based 164 on $2,395,552 for its line item on young adult depend- ents, $203,106 saved on the PCORI fee, $290,897 on the employer shared responsibility payments, and $47,300 on IRS reporting requirements. 35.

Conducting examinations of foreign and do- mestic insurers doing business in Nebraska to ensure compliance with Nebra ska laws and rules; 172 c. Monitoring the financial solvency of li- censed companies to make sure that con- sumers have the insurance coverage they expect when they need it; d. Issuing licenses to agents, brokers, consult- ants, and other entities that sell and mar- ket insurance products; e. Researching special insurance issues to un- derstand and assess their impact on Ne- braskans; f. Providing technical assistance on legisla- tion and promulgating rules and regula- tions to interpret insurance laws; g. Creating and distributing public infor- mation and consumer education about all types of insurance; and h. When insurance companies are in finan- cially hazardous condition or have become insolvent, working with the guaranty asso-ciations made up of insurance companies, which by s tatute must step in and pay poli- cyholder claims when an insurer, for exam- ple CoOportunity, fails. 3. As Director, I am the head of NDOI and the chief regulator of insurance in Nebraska. Generally, my official duties include supervising the entire agency, s erving as final adjudicator of all administra- tive actions, and serving on various councils and com- mittees in a variety of capacities. 4. Additionally, my official duties with NDOI in- clude studying the impact of the Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\" ) on Nebraska 's insurance market, ensuring Nebraska' s compliance with the ACA, advising the 173 Nebraska Governor on the ACA, and developing strat- egies for Nebraska to mitigate the numerous harms the ACA has inflicted on Nebraska 's health insurance markets. HARMS CAUSED BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT 5. The ACA has wrought havoc on the health in- surance market in Nebraska and imposed significant burdens on NDOI as regulator of Nebraska 's insur- ance market. 6. Prior to enactment of the ACA, Nebraska 's in- dividual major medical market offered more choices for consumers. For example, in 2010, approximately thirty carriers offered coverage in Nebraska 's individ- ual market. The ACA 's effect on insurers ' participa- tion in the market is demonstrated by the numbers: three carriers in 2014, fou r carriers in 2015 and 2016, two carriers in 2017, and one remaining carrier in 2018. 7. In 2017, two major carriers exited Nebraska' s individual market. Aetna announced its withdrawal from Nebraska 's individual market in May 2017, cit- ing an expected loss of $200 million for 2017 in the four states Aetna sold individual coverage. In June 2017, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Nebraska also an-nounced its withdrawal from Nebraska 's individual market, citing an expected loss of $12 million for 2017, in addition to the approximately $150 million loss the company experienced selling ACA plans in Nebraska from 2014 to 2016. In the wake of these companies ' de- partures, only a single insurer, Medica, remains in Ne- braska' s individual market. Nebraskans are left to hope t hat Medica \u2014 which raised premiums 31% for 174 plan year 2018\u2014 remains in the individual market for plan year 2019. 8. Premiums are predicted to keep rising. The Congressional Budget Office' s April 2018 \" Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028 \" estimates that, un- der current law, federal outlays for health insurance subsidies and related spending will rise by about 60 percent over the projection period, increasing from $58 billion in 2018 to $91 billion by 2028. (cbo.gov/publica- tion/53651). These rising premium s have a significant negative impact on middle -class Nebraskans. 9. The State of Nebraska itself has borne signifi- cant new costs as a result of the ACA. For example, the State of Nebraska, like other States, must offer non-full time employees ( i.e., employees working 30 - 39 hours per week) health insurance plans with pre- miums identical to those offered to full time employ- ees. 10. The Nebraska Department of Insurance, as the primary enforcer of insurance laws, has spent the past six years reading and enforcin g thousands of pages of federal regulations, guidance, and other sub - regulatory guidance related to the ACA, completely re-vised its insurance policy review standards for health insurance products, educated the public on changes in the law, and fielded cons umer complaints expressing confusion and frustration about the limited, expensive choices that remain in the Nebraska individual mar-ket. 11. Additionally, the ACA harms Nebraska be- cause it has preempted Nebraska law, preventing Ne-braska from regulating health insurance in the manner it sees fit. 175 12. The ACA forced insurers to issue policies to all qualified applicants, regardless of their health condi- tion, and the ACA does not allow insurers to charge higher premiums to people who, because of pre- exist- ing c onditions, have higher anticipated medical costs. The ACA forced insurers to pay for pre -existing condi- tions, which in turn drove up premiums. The ACA forcing insurers to charge the same rate regardless of health condition forced healthy people to pay high er premiums. While sick people 's premiums became lower, as discussed below, a mechanism already ex-isted in Nebraska law to provide coverage for high -cost individuals. 13. A recent study confirmed that the top one per- cent of insureds in Nebraska 's individua l market are responsible for 40 percent of the medical costs. Ne- braska law creates a high -risk pool, which operated as an insurer of last resort for people when private insur-ers refused to issue coverage to them due to expensive anticipated medical costs. Because the ACA makes private insurance available and \" affordable \" regard- less of a purchaser 's health condition, Nebraska 's high risk pool cannot operate as it did prior to 2014, to keep high-cost individuals from driving up premiums for in- surance purchase rs of average or good health. 14. Finally, the ACA harmed the Nebraska health insurance market by creating health insurance co -ops. CoOportunity Health, which operated in Iowa and Ne- braska, was the first co -op to go insolvent. Co- ops were conceived in the ACA as an alternative to commercial insurance, to create competition and drive down pre-miums. The premiums CoOportunity charged were in- sufficient to cover rising health costs, despite large enrollment numbers (120,000 insureds in Nebraska and Iowa combined ) and $147 million in loans from 176 the federal government, in addition to members ' pre- miums. Under Nebraska law, other health insurers were required to step in with funds to pay the claims of the more than 80,000 Nebraskans insured by CoOportunity. In summary, CoOportunity \" created competition \" by taking customers from the private market, went insolvent, then looked to its competitors to pay those customers ' claims. C oOportunity was put into liquidation in early 2015, and the C oOportunity liquidator filed suit against the federal government, which attempted to put itself, as creditor, ahead of pol- icyholders when the time came to disburse what funds remained in C oOportunity 's possession. The ACA 's co- op program, nationwide, has cost taxpayers more than $1.8 bil lion in funds that may never be recovered. Of the original 23 co -ops, only six remain. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on April 16, 2018 Signed, /s/ Bruce R. Ramge Bruce R.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET Defendants JON GODFREAD _______ Jon Godfread, being first duly sworn on oath, deposes and states as follows: 1. My name is Jon Godfread and I am the Com- missioner of the North Dakota Insurance Depart ment (\"NDID \"). 2. NDID is responsible for regulating the North Dakota health insurance market and protecting the consumers of this market. Overall, NDID performs a variety of tasks to protect insurance consumers and endure a competitive insurance market en vironment, including: a. Reviewing all insurance policies offered for sale in North Dakota to ensure compliance with North Dakota law; b. Conducting examinations of foreign and do- mestic insurers doing business in North Dakota to ensure compliance with Nort h Dakota laws and rules; 178 c. Monitoring the financial solvency of li- censed companies to make sure that con- sumers have the insurance coverage they expect when they need it; d. Issuing licenses to individuals who are qualified to serve as agents or consultant s and other entities that sell and market in- surance products; e. Reviewing and approving rates for health insurance plans prior to being offered for sale in North Dakota; f. Creating and distributing public infor-mation and consumer education about all types of insurance; and g. Providing input and assistance on legisla-tion and rules and regulations affecting in-surance. 3. As Commissioner, I am the head of the NDID and the chief regulator of insurance in North Dakota. 4. My official duties include studying t he impact of the Affordable Care Act ( 'ACA\" ) on North Dakota 's insurance market and developing strategies for North Dakota to mitigate the negative consequences the ACA has inflicted on North Dakota 's health insurance markets. 5. North Dakota 's health insu rance market was not broken prior to enactment of the ACA. North Da- kota had meaningful competition in its marketplace, a highly successful state high risk pool which offered a rich benefit plan, and the state had a low percentage of uninsured individuals. Prior to implementation of the ACA eight to ten percent of North Dakotans had no health insurance. After the implementation of the 179 ACA eight to ten percent of North Dakotans have no health insurance. The ACA attempted to fix some- thing, which was not broken and has resulted in many negative consequences to North Dakota. 6. In 2017, one major carrier completely exited North Dakota 's individual health exchange market- place due to continued expected financial losses. An- other major carrier exited North Dakota 's individual exchange marketplace in 48 of the state' s 53 counties, citing the same concerns. This left only one insurance company to sell on North Dakota 's individual ex- change marketplace in 48 of the state 's 53 counties for plan year 2018. 7. Premiums are p redicted to keep rising. These rising premiums have a significant negative impact on North Dakotans who are self -employed and do not qualify for a subsidy on the federal exchange, as these North Dakotans have been forced to take on the full weight of every rate increase over the years without assistance. 8. The NDID has spent the past eight years read- ing and enforcing thousands of pages of federal regu-lations and other regulatory guidance related to the ACA, spent countless hours on calls with federal offi- cials in an attempt to learn how these laws and rules impact North Dakota 's health insurance market and our consumers, completely revised its insurance policy review standards for health insurance products, and fielded consumer complaints expressing confusi on and frustration about the limited, expensive choice that re- main in North Dakota 's individual market. 180 9. The ACA harms North Dakota because it has preempted North Dakota law, preventing North Da- kota from regulating health insurance in the manner it sees fit. 10. The ACA forced insurers to issue policies to all qualified applicants, regardless of their health condi-tion, and the ACA does not allow insurers to charge higher premium to people who, because of pre- existing conditions, have higher anticipated me dical costs. The ACA forced insures to pay for pre -existing conditions, which in turn drove up premiums. The ACA forcing insurers to charge the same rate regardless of health condition has forced individuals without pre -existing conditions to pay much higher premiums and in many cases, the end result has been that these individuals cannot afford to have health insurance coverage. 11. North Dakota law creates a high risk pool, which prior to the enactment of the ACA operated as an insurer of last resort for people when private insur-ers declined to issue coverage to them due to expensive anticipated medical costs. Since the ACA makes pri- vate insurance available regardless of a purchaser 's health condition, North Dakota 's high risk pool cannot operate as it did prior to 2014, to keep high -cost indi- viduals from driving up premiums for individuals of average or good health.

I am the Insurance Policy Director of the Pub- lic Employee Benefit Authority, which administers the Group Health Benefits Plan of the Employees of the State of South Carolina, the public school districts, and participating entities (typically referenced a s the \"State Health Plan \"). 2. I am familiar with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, P. L. 111- 148, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, P. L. 111 - 152 (ACA). 3. State Health Plan participants include state officers as well as employees of: State agencies (pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 1-11-710) 183 Public school districts (pursuant to \u00a7 1 -11- 710) Other participating entities/local subdivi- sions that to participate pursuant to \u00a7 1-11-720 Participants also incl ude retirees of these employers as defined in\u00a7 1 -11-730 of the Code of Laws and the eligible spouses and eligible children of employees and retirees. 4. Since January 1, 2011, the State Health Plan has complied with the following ACA -prescribed ben- efits th at were not previously provided under the Plan: No preexisting condition exclusion for indi- viduals younger than 19 No preexisting condition exclusion for indi-viduals older than 19 (1/1/2014) No lifetime limits on essential benefits Restricted annual limits on essential bene- fits Prohibition on rescission of coverage Dependent coverage of children younger than 26 5. The net material measureable direct financial impact of the ACA on the State Health Plan totals $29,230,152 during the period from 2011 through 2017: Reinsurance/PCORI Fees (2013 -2017) -$45,291,815 Early Retirement Reinsur- ance Fund (2012) +$27,142,502 184 Lifetime Medical Claims over $2M - $11,080,839 Net total $29,230,252 Notes on calculation: The $2 million lifetime maxi- mum in force prior to January 1, 2011 was only ap- plied to medical expense, not to pharmacy, so pharmacy is not included in the calculation. Further-more, the mandated addition of adult children up to age 26 and the addition of non -permanent employees was addressed through actuar ial adjustment of contri- butions. The MUSC Health Plan was not included in the calculation because it was created voluntarily as an ACA non -grandfathered plan with the understand- ing of mandatory ACA coverage requirements.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET S STECKEL _______ My name is Thomas Steckel and I am over the age of 18 and fully competent to make this declaration and state the following: 1. I am the Director of the Division of Employee Benefits within the South Dakota Bureau of Human Resources ( \"Bureau \"). I have served with the Bureau for 4 years. As the Dire ctor of the Division of Employee Benefits ( \"Division \"), I am responsible for developing and implementing the State 's health plan for state em- ployees, including flexible benefits such as a vision and dental plan. As a part of these responsibilities, I recom mend policy for the State 's health plan, admin- ister the health plan, and monitor and balance the health plan 's financials. I am particularly familiar with changes in costs, plans, and policies related to the enactment of the ACA because of my role as the D irec- tor of the Division. I have personal knowledge of the matters and information set forth herein. 186 2. The Bureau serves four main roles for the State of South Dakota, each role having its own divi- sion within the Bureau. The first role is the Bureau provid es human resource services to each agency and bureau under the purview of the Governor of South Dakota. These services include the processing of pay- roll, maintaining personnel files, and utilizing Human Resource Managers to assist agencies in hiring, devel- oping, and the disciplining of employees. The second role is the Bureau provides employee and organiza-tional development through services such as employee training, leadership development, and 360 and en- gagement surveys. The third role is the Bureau lies i n classification and compensation. The Bureau estab- lishes and administers a compensation structure for executive branch employees and classifies each posi-tion based upon the position 's job duties. The fourth major role of the Bureau is the establishment an d ad- ministration of the benefits for state employees, which includes the State 's health plan, the flexible benefits available to state employees, and workers ' compensa- tion program for state employees. 3. With the passing of the ACA, the Bureau has suffered both administrative and financial burdens that it otherwise would not have. The ACA deprived the Bureau of the flexibility it previously had to pro- vide health insurance plans tailored to the needs of its population. Financial Costs Associated with ACA Regula- tions 4. The individual mandate caused the following estimated financial burdens to the Bureau: a. IRO Review of denied appeals: $10,400.00 ongoing costs; 187 b. Elimination of lifetime Pre-existing conditions exclu sion prohib- ited by ACA: unable to accurately estimate the ongoing costs of this mandate; d. Expanded eligibility for adult dependent children to age 26: unable to accurately es-timate the ongoing costs of this mandate; e. Expanded preventive services paid o nly by the plan: $4,575,200.00 ongoing costs; f. Transitional Reinsurance Program fee: 3,202,942.00 tute fee: $172,141.00 ongoing costs; h. Expanded health plan eligibility for part - time employees who did not meet the State 's health plan 's pre -ACA eligibility definition: $1,514,205.00 ongoing costs; and i. Form administration: $100,000.00 ongoing costs. 5. \"Lifetime maximum benefit\" is the maximum dollar amount a health insurance plan will pa y in ben- efits to an insured person during that person 's life- time. The ACA banned insurance contracts nationwide from including any lifetime maximum benefit. The ACA thus eliminated the Bureau' s ability to impose lifetime maximum benefits for essential health benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300 -gg-ll (West). Prior to the implementation of the ACA, the Bureau main- tained a lifetime annual maximum of $2,000,000. Since the implementation of the ACA, the Bureau has been liable to pay, and has paid, substantial costs that would not have been payable had the pre- ACA lifetime 188 maximum benefits still been in place. In the seven - year period between 2011 and 2017, the Bureau has paid approximately $19,140,252 in costs that would not have been due had the ACA not eliminated its abi l- ity to apply a lifetime maximum benefit. Compliance with the ACA will require the Bureau to indefinitely continue paying these additional costs. 6. Prior to adoption of the ACA, the Bureau re- quired insured persons to pay coinsurance and/or co - pays for pre ventative care that are now disallowed be- cause the ACA requires that preventative care be cov- ered at 100%. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg -13 (West). The change to 100% funding of preventative care has cost the Bu- reau substantial sums. During the six -year period from 20 12 to 2017, therefore, the 100% funding for preventative care mandated by the ACA has imposed costs upon the Bureau approximating $4,575,200. 100% funding for preventative care is a permanent re- quirement pursuant to the ACA, so these costs to the Bureau as a result will continue indefinitely. 7. Prior to implementation of the ACA, the Bu- reau provided insurance coverage for contraceptive drugs at a rate below 100%. The ACA, however, re- quires contraceptives to be -13(a)(4) (W est); 77 Fed.Reg. (Feb. 2012). Covering a class of drugs at 100% of cost is more ex- pensive for the Bureau than covering a drug at less than 100% of cost. If the Bureau could have main-tained its prior coverage plan for contraceptives, therefore, it would have saved significant monies. Spe- cifically, the Bureau would have saved approximately $672,780 during the five -year period from FY 2013 through 2017. The 100% funding for contraceptives mandate is permanent pursuant to the ACA, so these costs to the Bu reau continue. 189 8. The ACA requires the Bureau to pay a Pa- tient- Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) fee. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9511. The fee was started under the ACA for advancements in comparative clinical effec-tiveness research. The fee increases yearly a nd is based on per average number of lives that are covered by the plan or policy. In the last fiscal year, the Bureau paid $2.26 per person enrolled in a health insurance plan. If the PCORI fee had not been required under the ACA, the Bureau would have sa ved approximately $172,141 for FY 2014 to 2018. This fee is imposed cur- rently for plans that end before October 1, 2019 and, therefore, will continue to be paid into 2020 under the ACA. 9. The ACA requires the Agency to pay the Tran- sitional Reinsurance Pro gram fee. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18061. This fee is collected by the federal government to fund reinsurance payments to issuers of non -grandfathered reinsurance -eligible individual market plans, the ad- ministrative costs of operating the reinsurance pro-gram, and the G eneral Fund of the U.S. Treasury for the 2014, 2015, and 2016 benefit years. If this require- ment had not been in place, the Bureau would have saved approximately $2,622,787 in FY 2015 and FY 2016. 10. Prior to the ACA, a full -time employee was de- fined as a n employee who is employed at least 40 hours per week; the ACA altered that number to 30 hours per week. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 Pub. L. 111-148, 124 Stat. 865, \u00a7 4980H(d)(4)(A). This change impacted the Bureau by increasing the number of per- sons the B ureau must insure, thus increasing the total cost of providing insurance. The change required the Bureau to provide insurance coverage to seasonal or temporary employees who meet the ACA definition of 190 eligible employee. The ACA change in definition of el- igible employee would have reduced the cost to the Bu- reau of providing health insurance coverage to all \"full-time\" and eligible permanent part -time employ- ees by approximately $1,514,205 for FY 2014 to The 30 -hour \"full-time em- ployee\" rule is a permanent requirement under the ACA and, thus, these costs to the Bureau as a result will continue. 11. Given the facts summarized in \u00b6\u00b6 4 -10 above, compliance with mandatory provisions of the ACA has imposed costs upon the Bureau approximati ng $28,715,140.00 dollars in FY 2012- 2017 in order to comply with the federal government 's requirements under the ACA. These impositions of costs upon the Bureau will continue indefinitely because the man-dates imposed by the ACA are generally permanent. Administrative Burdens Associated with ACA Regulations 12. The individual mandate caused significant ad- ministrative burdens and expenses to program our IT system to track and report ACA eligible employees and complete mandatory IRS Form 1095 annual re- ports. 13. The ACA mandates constrain our flexibility in plan design decisions, and the continued uncertainty as to the potential changes in the law, including par- tial repeal of certain provisions, make long term stra-tegic planning more complicated than it would be absent the ACA. 14. The Bureau recently made changes to the State employee health plan for the FY 2019 and those changes assumed the ACA is still federal law. Repeal of the ACA is necessary now, as opposed to in future 191 months or years, because the conf ines of the law that the Bureau is forced to operate within create a signif- icant obstacle to solving current budgetary concerns. Without the expenses described above in \u00b6\u00b6 4 -13, the Bureau would gain back approximately $5.1 million in funding. If the ACA i s not repealed now, however, this funding would not be available to the Bureau in time to plan for the FY 2019. Thus, the Bureau, its enrol- lees and the taxpayers of South Dakota would be sig- nificantly burdened if the ACA remained law pending this suit. 15. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and cor-rect.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET June 2018] _______ DECLARATION OF HENRY J. AARON _______ I, Henry J. Aaron, declare as follows: 1. I am currently the Bruce and Virginia Mac- Laury Senior Fellow in the Economic Studies Program at the Brookings Institution. From 1990 through 1996, I was the Director of the Economic Studies Program. I am a member of the District of Columbia Health Ben- efits Exchange Executive Board and a member and former chair of the Social Security Advisory Board. I am a graduate of UCLA and hold a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University. I taught at the University of Maryland from 1967 through 1989, except for 1977 and 1978 when I served as Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare . I chaired the 1979 Advisory Council on Social Security. During the aca- demic year 1996- 97, I was a Guggenheim Fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sci- ences at Stanford University. I have been a member of 193 the visiting committees for the Department of Eco- nomics and the Medical and Dental Schools at Har- vard University. I am the author of many books and articles on health insurance and health care policy, in- cluding two studies of the impact on health care of lim- ited resources in Great Britain (with William Schwartz), a study of health policy in the United States, and recommendations for modifications in Medicare (a book with Jeanne Lambrew and an article with Robert Reischauer). 2. In creating this declaration, I consulted with fellow national health experts Sara Rosenbaum, the Harold and Jane Hirsh Professor of Health Law and Policy and founding chair, Department of Health Pol- icy, Milken Institute School of Public Health, George Washington University and Jeffrey Levi, Professor of Health Policy and Management at the Milken Insti- tute School of Public Health, George Washington Uni- versity. While I consulted with these individuals for their expert advice, I can attest to the information in this declaration based on my independent experience and background. 3. I understand that this lawsuit involves a chal- lenge to the Affordable Care Act and seeks to enjoin it. As noted above, I am the author of numerous books an d articles on health insurance and health care pol- icy. In my expert opinion, enjoini ng the Affordable Care Act would completely disrupt the U.S. health care market for patients, providers, insurance carri- ers, and federal and state governments. 194 The Affordable Care Act Has Contributed to Improvements in Health Coverage, Access, Financial Security, and Affordability 4. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is a compre- hensive law that has improved the quality and afford- ability of health care and health insurance. It has done so by: strengthening consumer protections in private insurance; making the individual insurance market accessible and affordable; expanding and improving the Medicaid program; modifying Medicare 's payment systems while filling in benefit gaps; increasing fund- ing and prioritization of prevention and public health; supporting infras tructure such as community health centers, the National Health Service Corps, and the Indian Health Service, among other policies. There is widespread agreement that the ACA is the most sig- nificant health legislation enacted since the Social Se- curity Act amendments that created Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. 5. The ACA helped lower the number of people without health insurance by an estimated 20.0 million people from October 2013 to early 2016, a drop of 43 percent in the uninsured rate. This increase in cover- age included 3 million African -Americans, 4 million people of Hispanic origin, and 8.9 million white non- elderly adults. An estimated 6.1 million young adults and 1.2 million children gained coverage between 2010 and early 2016.1,2 The reduction in the uninsured rate 1 Uberoi N, Finegold K and Gee E, Health Insurance Coverage and the Affordable Care Act, 2010 - 2016, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation Issue Brief, 2016, https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/187551/ACA2010-2016.pdf 2 Executive O ffice of the President Council of Economic Advisors, 195 occurred across the income spectrum: the 2013 to 2015 rate reduction was 36 percent, 33 percent, and 31 per- cent for non-elderly people with income below 138 per- cent of poverty, between 138 and 400 percent of poverty, and above 400 percent of poverty respec- tively.3 The drop in the uninsured rate was larger in states that expanded Medicaid than in states that did not do so.4 6. Many studies have found that access to health care has improved since the ACA was enacted, espe- cially among low- income people.5 For example, from the fall of 2013 to the spring of 2017, the share of non- elderly adults without a regular source of care fell from 30 percent to 24.7 percent; the share that did not receive a routine checkup in the last 12 months fell from near ly 40 percent to 34 percent.6 The Council of 2017 Economic Report of the President , Chapter 4 Reforming the Health Care System, U.S. Government Publishing Office, 2017, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ chapter_4-reform ing_health_care_system_2017.pdf 3 Executive Office of the President Council of Economic Advisors, 2017 Economic Report of the President , Chapter 4 Reforming the Health Care System, U.S. Government Publishing Office, 2017, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.g ov/sites/default/files/docs/ chapter_4-reforming_health_care_system_2017.pdf 4 Broaddus, M, Census Data: States Not Expanding Medicaid Lag Further on Health Coverage, Center on Budget and A, The Affordable Care Act's Impacts on Access to Insurance and Health Care for Low - Income Populations, Annual Review of Public Health, 2017, 38:489-505, https:// www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/an- nurev Karmpan M, Shartzer A and Zuckerman S, 196 Economic Advisers (CEA) estimated a one third drop in the share of people who reported that they were un- able to obtain needed medical care because of cost, with the 2015 level falling below its pre-recession level. The CEA also found a correlation between in- creased coverage and an increased share of people having a personal doctor and receiving a checkup in the past 12 months.7 A review of the literature in 2017 found evidence that significant improvements in ac- cess to and use of care were associated with gaining coverage. These gains included increased use of outpa- tient care; greater rates of having a usual source of care or personal physician; increased use of preventive services; increased prescription drug use and adher- ence; and improved access to surgical care.8 Racial and ethnic disparities in access to care fell following the expansion of coverage.9 Sustained Gains in Coverage, Access, and Affordability Under the ACA: A 2017 Update.

The expansion of coverage and other provi- sions of the ACA will contribute to longer, healthier lives. Resea rch on previous coverage expansions has found that having health insurance coverage improves children 's learning ability, adults ' productivity, and seniors' qualify of life.10 A recent review found that coverage improves rates of diagnosing chronic condi- tions, treatment of such conditions, outcomes for peo- ple with depression, and self-reported health.11 The CEA estimated that, if the ACA experience matches that in Massachusetts, 24,000 deaths are being avoided annually.12 The Institute of Medicine also found that coverage improves community health by limiting the spread of communicable diseases and re- ducing the diversion of public health resources for medical care for the uninsured.13 Insurance Coverage, Access to Care, and Health Under the Af- fordable Care Act.

The law's contribution to health extends be- yond its coverage provisions. In part thanks to the ACA's payment incentives and its Partnership for Pa- tients initiative, an estimated 125,000 fewer patients died in the hospital as a result of hospital -acquired conditions in 2015 compared to 2010, saving approxi- mately $28 billion in health care costs over this pe- riod.14 And its Tips from Former Smokers initiative resulted in an estimated 500,000 people quitting smoking permanently in the first five years of the cam- paign.15 9. The ACA strengthened financial security as well as physical and mental health. A study found that self-reported concerns about the cost of health care dropped at a greater rate for low income people in two states that expanded Medicaid relative to one that did not.16 Between September 2013 and March 2015, the number of people having problems paying medical bills dropped by an estimated 9.4 million, a reduction destiny -community -effects-of- uninsurance. 14 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Score- card on Rates of Hospital -Acquired Conditions 2010 to 2015: In- terim Data from National Efforts to Make Health Care Safer , December 2016, https://www.ahrq.gov/professio nals/qualitypa- tient-safety/pfp/2015-interim.html 15 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tips Impact and Results, no date, Changes and Health Among Low -Income Adults after Med- icaid Expansion or Expanded Private Internal 2016, 176:1501- 1509, https://jamanetwork.com/jour- 22.0 to 17.3 percent of non-elderly adults.17 One study found that the amount of debt sent to collection was reduced by over $1,000 per person residing in ZIP Codes with the highest share of low- income, unin- sured individuals in states that expanded Medicaid compared to those that did not expand the program.18 The law also has reduced income inequality: projected incomes in the bottom tenth of the distribution will in- crease by 7.2 percent while those in the top tenth will be reduced by 0.3 percent.19 10. Most experts agree that the ACA contributed to slower health care cost growth since its enactment, although there is disagreement about the size of the effect. The prices of health care goods and services grew more slowly in the period from 2010 to 2016 than in any comparable period since these data began to be collected in 1959. Adding to this, health care service use growth per enrollee slowed since 2010.

Additionally, employer- based health plan premiums and out-of-pocket costs grew more slowly from 2010 to 2016 than they did from 2000 to 2010. As a result, total spending associated with a family policy was $4,400 less in 2016 than it would have been had costs risen as fast as they did during the previous decade. The coverage expans ion under the law also lowered hospitals ' cost of providing uncompensated care by $10.4 billion in 2015; in states that expanded Medicaid, the share of hospital operat- ing costs devoted to uncompensated care dropped by around half during this period.20 11. The ACA's contribution to lower health care cost growth has broader economic effects. It helped stabilize the share of gross domestic product spent on health. When the ACA was under consideration, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the ACA would reduce the federal budget deficit by an es- timated $115 billion from 2010 to 2019 by cutting fed- eral health spending and raising revenue.21 States have realized budget savings as well because of in - creased federal Medicaid support and reduced uncom- pens ated care costs. Because the ACA has lowered the 20 Executive Office of the President Council of Economic Advisors, 2017 Economic Report of the President , Chapter 4 Reforming the Health Care System, U.S. Government Publishing Office, 2017. https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ chapter_4-reforming_ health_care_system_2017.pdf. 21 Elmendorf DW, Letter to Honorable Nancy Pelosi, Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives, Congressional Budget Office, March 20, 2010, https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/111th - congress-2009-2010/costestimate/amendreconprop .pdf 201 cost to employers of health insurance for their employ- ees, workers have received higher wages and other fringe benefits. The ACA also has reduced \"job lock, \" by freeing workers to change jobs without fear of los- ing health insurance coverage. An estimated 1.5 mil- lion people became self-employed because of the ACA's individual market reforms and financial assistance.22 Contrary to some critics ' claims, there is no evidence that the law's benefits have come at the expense of em- ployment, hours of work, or compensation.23 ACA cov- erage also improves the U.S. system of automatic stabilizers by protecting families ' health coverage dur- ing economic downturns. Improvement is greatest in states that expanded Medicaid. The ACA Expanded Consumer Protections in All Types of Private Insurance 12. The ACA improved the quality, accessibility, and affordability of health insurance coverage both for people who were already insured and for the previ- ously uninsured. Insurers may no longer set higher premiums for people with pre-existing conditions, charge women more than men, and carve out benefits 22 Blumberg LJ, Corlette S and Lucia K, The Affordable Care Act: Improving Incentives for Entrepreneurship and Self Employ- ment, Timely Analysis of Immediate Health Policy Issues , Urban Institute, May 2013, https://www.urban.org/sites/de-fault/files/publ ication/23661/412830-The-Affordable -Care -Act- Improving -Incentives-for-Entrepreneurship -and-Self-Employ- ment.PDF 23 Abraham J and Royalty AB, How Has the Affordable Care Act Affected Work and Wages, Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, University of P ennsylvania, Issue Brief, January 2017, https://ldi.upenn.edu/brief/how-has -affordable -care -actaf- fected- work -and-wages 202 for people who need them. They can no longer set an- nual or lifetime limits on total benefits or rescind cov- erage except in cases of fraud. Insurers must cover dependents up to age 26 under their parents ' plans, include annual out-of-pocket limits, and provide re- bates to the insured if total benefits do not exceed stat- utory shares of premiums received. All non- grandfathered private plans must cover such evi- dence -based preventive services as immunizations and cancer screenings, and they must do so with no cost sharing. Individual and small group plans now must include essential health benefits: ten categories of health services with a scope that is the same as a typical employer plan. The ACA also filled in the gaps in the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, which requires group health plans and insurers that offer mental health and substance use disorder bene- fits to provide coverage that is comparable to coverage for general medical and surgical care. 13. The ACA's guarantee of access to health insur- ance offers peace of mind to the up to 133 million Americans who have a pre-existing health condition, including parents of 17 million children w ith such con- ditions.24 Before the ACA, those with pre-existing con- ditions had to worry about finding affordable coverage if they lost a job that provided health insurance or they stopped being eligible for programs such as Medicaid or the Children 's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Even if they could find insurance, they faced the risk that needed services might be \"carved -out\" for them or 24 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Health Insurance Coverage for Americans with Pre -Existing Conditions: Th e Impact of the Affordable Care Act, Issue Brief, January 2017, https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/255396/Pre - ExistingConditions.pdf 203 excluded for all enrollees: before 2014, 62 percent of individual market enrollees lacked maternity cover- age, 34 percent lacked coverage for substance use dis- orders, 18 percent lacked coverage for mental health care, and 9 percent lacked prescription drug cover- age.25 Before enactment of the ACA, parents of chil- dren with autism typically lacked private health insuranc e coverage for habilitative services. The ACA bars benefit carve -outs and requires all individual and small group market plans to cover essential health benefits. The ACA's focus on comprehensive benefits has been particularly important in combatting the opi- oid epidemic: it requires coverage of screening and treatment for substance use disorders, has expanded parity to all plans, and supports integrating preven- tion and treatment with mental health, primary care, and other related services.26 14. The ACA has improved women's coverage as well. From 2010 to early 2016, 9.5 million women gained coverage.27 Starting in 2014, the ACA banned the common practice of varying insurance rates by sex 25 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Essential Health Benefits: Individual Market Coverage, Issue Brief , December 2011, https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic -report/essen- tial-health -benefits-individual-market-coverage 26 phreys KN, Pollack HA PD, The Affordable Care Act Transformation of Substanc e Use Disorder Treatment, Amer- ican Journal of 2017, 107(1):31-32, https://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5308192/ 27 Uberoi N, Finegold K and Gee E, Health Insurance Coverage and the Affordable Care Act, 2010 - 2016, Office of the Assi stant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation Issue Brief, 2016. https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/187551/ACA2010-2016.pdf 204 - a practice that had added an estimated $1 billion a year to women's hea lth insurance premiums.28 Health plans may no longer carve -out maternity care from plans and must allow women to see their obstetrician or gynecologist without a referral. All non-grandfa- thered plans must cover women's preventive services, which includes contraceptive services, screening for interpersonal and domestic violence, and breast -feed- ing services and supplies. The ACA's reduction in cost- sharing for contraceptive services increased women's use of these services, including long- term contracep- tion methods.29 The ACA's bar on sex discrimination makes it an important civil rights, as well as health reform, law. 15. The ACA has improved coverage for young adults. The ACA requires health insurers to extend dependent coverage to children up to age 26. An esti- mated 2.3 million young adults (ages 19 to 25) gained health insurance between 2010 and the end of 2013. Starting in 2014, millions more gained coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplaces and other reforms.30 According to one review, \"a wealth of ev i- 28 Garrett D, Greenberger M, Waxman J, Benyo A, Dickerson K, Gallagher -Robbins K, Moore R and Trumble S, Turning To Fair- ness: Insura nce Discrimination Against Women Today and the Affordable Care Act, National Women's Law Center , Report, March 2012, https://www.nwlc.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/nwlc _2012_turningtofairness_report.pdf 29 Carlin CS, Fertig AR and Dowd BE, Affordable Care Act's Man- date Eliminating Contraceptive Cost Sharing Influenced Choices of Women With Employer Coverage, Health Affairs 35(9), 2016, https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2015.1457 30 Uberoi N, Finegold K and Gee E, Health Insurance Coverage 205 dence finds that the ACA dependent coverage expan- sions increased access to care, use of a wide variety of services, and reduced out-of-pocket spending. \"31 For example, mental health visits increased by 9.0 percent and inpatient visits by 3.5 percent for young adults gaining coverage on their parents ' plans.32 16. The ACA newly required all private health plans to end the use of annual and lifetime limits and to include an annual out-of-pocket limit on cost shar- ing. An estimated 22 million people enrolled in em- ployer coverage are now protected against catastrophic costs.33 While data collected on personal bankruptcy does not include causes, filings dropped by about 50 percent between 2010 and 2016; experts at- tribute some of this change to the new financial pro- tections offered by the ACA starting in 2010.34 and the Affordable Care Act, 2010 - 2016, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation Issue Brief, 2016. https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/187551/ACA2010-2016.pdf 31 Abraham J and Royalty AB, How Has the Affordable Care Act Affected Work and Wages, Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Issue Brief , January 2017, Y, Moriya AS and Simon KI, Access to Health In- surance and the Use of Inpatient Medical Care: Evidence from the Affordable Care Act Young Adult Mandate, J Health Econ 39:171-187, 2015, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ 25544401 33 Executive Office of the President Council of Economic Advisors, 2017 Econ omic Report of the President , Chapter 4 Reforming the Health Care System, U.S. Government Publishing Office, 2017. https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ chapter_4-reforming_health_care_system_2017.pdf 34 St. John A, How the Affordable Care Act Drove Down Personal 206 The ACA's Health Insurance Marketplaces Have Given Millions Access to Quality Private Insurance, Often with Financial Assistance 17. The ACA created Health Insurance Market- places (Marketplaces), a new way for people not eligi- ble for Medicare or Medicaid to get affordable, accessible private insurance independent of their jobs. These Marketplaces offer websites at which people can compare plans that have four different levels of cost sharing (bronze, silver, gold, and platinum). 35 Finan- cial assistance comes through income-related, pre- mium-based tax credits for qualified individuals with income between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level and cost-sharing assistance or \"reduc- tions\" for qualified individuals with income between 100 and 250 percent of the federal poverty level en-rolled in silver plans. The Marketplaces also provide people with support in navigating the system through in-person help and call centers. In 2018, 12 states op-erate their State-based Marketplaces (SBMs) (operat- ing their own websites rather than using the federally run HealthCare.gov), 28 states rely entirely on the federal government to run their Marketplaces (use HealthCare.gov), and 11 states have hybrid Market- places (assuming some but not all functions). 36 The Bankruptcy, Consumer Reports , May 2017, https://www.consum- erreports.org/personal-bankruptc y/how-the-aca-drove-down-per- sonal-bankruptcy/ 35 People under age 30 also have access to a plan that only covers catastrophic costs. 36 Kaiser Family Foundation, State Health Insurance Market- place Types, 2018, https://www.kff.org/health-reform/stateindi- cator/state-health-insurance -marketplacetypes/?current 207 Marketplaces also offer small businesses a way to find qualified health plans (called SHOP). 18. Several aspects of the ACA contributed to the 57 percent increase between 2013 and 2016 in the number of people covered in the individual market (on and off Marketplaces). 37 An estimated 40 to 50 percent of the coverage gain explained by the ACA resulted from the Health Insurance Marketplaces' policies.38 One key reason for this expansion is financial assis-tance, primarily in the form of premium tax credits. In 2017, 84 percent of the 10.3 million people enrolled in Marketplaces received prem ium tax credits, whose av- erage annualized amount was $4,458 per enrollee. 39 The premium tax credit is set to limit the percent of income an enrollee pays for the second-lowest silver plan in an area. This method of setting assistance means that aid varies regionally with health insur- ance costs. Second, individual market insurance re- forms contributed to increased individual market enrollment.

How much of this increase in coverage can be traced to financial incentives, changes in insurance require- ments, or the coverage mandate remains a matter of academic dispute. 19. The ACA set up the Marketplaces to encour- age competition among insurers, both the keep premi- ums low and improve customer service. To that end, it standardized benefits to facilitate shopping on price, required that the Marketplaces create tools to allow consumer to compare plans, and established a perma- nent risk-adjustment program to prevent insurer s from profiting by disproportionately enrolling people with lower- than -average health care costs. The unsub- sidized cost of coverage in the Marketplaces, before the start of the Trump Administration, was 10 percent lower than the average employer-sponsored insurance premium.41 In the early years after the Marketplaces opened, some insurers set prices so low that they lost money in order to gain market share; others did not 40 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Health Insurance Coverage for Americans with Pre -Existing Conditi ons: The Impact of the Affordable Care Act, Issue Brief, January 2017, https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/255396/Pre - ExistingConditions.pdf 41 Blumberg Are Nongroup Mar- Really High?

Access and satisfaction as well as affordability of individual market coverage have improved. Accord- ing to one survey, in 2010, 60 percent of people seeking individual market coverage found it very difficult or impossible to find affordable care; by 2016, that pro- portion fell to 34 percent.46 A study of people newly en- rolled in one plan in California and Colorado found that the proportion of enrollees with a personal health care provider rose from 59 to 73 percent, and the pro- portion receiving a flu shot in the previous year rose from 41 to 52 percent.47 Satisfaction was roughly the same among enrollees in Marketplace plans and em- ployer plans in 2016.48 Satisfaction among adults with Marketplace or Medicaid coverage rose between 2014 (78 percent) and 2017 (89 percent).49 46 Collins SR, Gunja MZ, Doty MM and Beutel S, How the Afford- able Care Act Has Improved Americans; Ability to Buy Health Insurance on Their Own, The Commonwealth Fund, Issue Brief, 2016, http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/is-suebriefs/2017/feb/how -the-aca-has-improved-ability -to-buy-in- surance 47 Schmittdiel JA, Barrow JC, L, Sam D, Chau CV and Shetterly SM, Improvements in Access and Care Through the Affordable Care Act, American Journal of Managed of US Health Care Consumers: A look at Exchange Consumers, Deloitte Development LLC, 2016, https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Docu-ments/life -sciences -health -care/us -dchs -consumer-survey -hix.pdf 49 The Commonwealth Fund, A Majority of Marketplace and 211 The ACA's Medicaid Provisions Expanded Eligi- bility, Improved Accessibility and Quality of Care, and Increased Savings 21. The ACA included a number of changes to Medicaid. It expanded Medicaid coverage to adults with income under 138 percent of the federal policy level (which the Supreme Court ruled was unenforce- able as a mandate in 2012, but which 32 states have now adopted). It expanded minimum coverage stand- ards for children ages 6 to 18, simplified program eli- gibility rules as well as the enrollment and renewal process, increased spending on long-term services and supports, added incentives to encourage quality meas- urement, and promoted care coordination for dual Medicare -Medicaid eligible beneficiaries. It made fam- ily planning coverage a state option, extended cover- age for young adults aging out of foster care, increased Medicaid drug rebates, and increased efforts to com- bat fraud. Through the Center for Medicare and Med- icaid Innovation (CMMI), the ACA also supported testing and evaluation of payment reforms to improve quality and decrease costs. The ACA also extended funding for CHIP and made policy changes that Con- gress recently largely incorporated in a ten-year reau- thorization of the program. 22. The number of non-elderly p eople with Medi- caid coverage increased by 13 percent between 2013 and 2016,50 largely because 32 states (including the Medicaid Enrollees Are Getting Health Care They Could Not Have Afforded Prior to Having Coverage, Affordable Care Act Tracking Survey, no date, http://acatracking.commonwealth-fund.org/ 50 Kaiser Family Foundation, Health Insurance Coverage of Non- elderly 0 -64, 2013 and 2016, https://www.kff.org/other/ 212 District of Columbia) expanded eligibility to low- in- come adults under the new category created by the ACA.51 Eligibility rule streamlining and other simpli- fications, increased outreach efforts, a \"spillover\" ef- fect from the opening of the Marketplaces, and the individual mandate appear to have had a coverage ef- fect as well. A recen t literature review listed numer- ous studies documenting reductions in all states of the proportion of people without insurance. Reductions have been larger in states that expanded Medicaid than in those that did not. It also found that the Med- icaid expansi on improved coverage among young adults, people with HIV, veterans, rural residents, and racial and ethnic minorities.52 The law's Medicaid expansion 's impact on coverage may have exceeded that of other ACA policies.53 23. At least 40 studies have found impr oved ac- cess to and use of health care associated with the Med- icaid expansion. For example, one study found that, stateindicator/nonelderly -0-64/?dataView=1&currentTimeframe =3&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort %22:%22asc%22%7D 51 Maine has also scheduled an expansion to begin on July 1, 2018. 52 Antonisse L, Garfield R, Rudowitz R and Artiga S, The Effects of Medicaid Expansion Under the ACA: Updated Findings From a Literature Review, Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation , Issue Brief, September J Sommers BD, Premium Subsidies, the Mandate, and Medicaid Expansion: Coverage Effects of the Af-fordable Care Act, National Bureau of Economic Research, 53:72- 86, 2016, http://www.nber.org/papers/w22213 213 from November 2013 to December 2015, low-income adults in two expansion states reported a greater in- crease (12.1 percentage points) in having a personal physician and a greater reduction (18.2 percentage points) in cost related barriers to access to care com- pared to low- income adults in a non-expansion state.54 Medicaid coverage also has increased access to treat- ment for substance use disorder, including opioid ad- diction.55 Some critics of the ACA have alleged that Medicaid expansion caused addiction. What research- ers have found is that states that expanded eligibility tended to have higher rates of addiction before enact- ment of the ACA but that drug related mortality fell compared to states that did not expand Medicaid after enactment.56 Evidence is also building that Medicaid coverage for low-income adults has helped provide 54 Sommers BD, Blendon RJ, Orav EJ and Epstein AM, Changes and Health Among Low -Income Adults After Med- icaid Expansion or Expanded Private Insurance, JAMA Intern Med., 176(1):1501-1509, 2016, https://jamanetwork.com/jour- nals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2542420 55 Clemens -Cope L, Epstein M and Kenney G, Rapid Growth in Medicaid Spending on Medications to Treat Opioid UseDisorder and Overdose, The Ur J, Borders T and Druss B, Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Medicaid -Cov- ered Utilization of Buprenorphine for 56 Goodman-Bacon Did Medicaid Expansion Cause The Opioid Epidemic?

Much of the evidence on improvements to health stemming from the ACA comes from its Medi- caid expansion. One analysis found a 6.1 percent rela- tive reduction in adjusted all-cause mortality in states that had expanded Medicaid before the ACA.58 In ad- dition, studies have documented improved outcomes for such services as cardiac surgery associated with the ACA's Medicaid policies.59 25. The ACA's Medicaid expansion has also led to documented savings to people, states, and the health system. For exa mple, self-reported medical debt in Ohio fell by nearly 50 percent after it broadened Med- icaid eligibility.60 An analysis of prescription drug transaction data found that uninsured people gaining 57 Regenstein M and Rosenbaum S, What The Affordable Care Act Means For People With Jail Stays, Health Affairs, 33(3), 2014, https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2013 .1119. 58 Sommers BD, Baicker K and Epstein AM, Mortality and Access to Care among Adults after State Medicaid Expansions, The New England Journal of Medicine, 367:(1025-1034), 2012, http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa1202099. 59 Charles E, Johnston LE, RL and Kron IL, Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Cardiac Surgery Volume and Outcomes, The Annals of Tho-racic Surgery, 104:1251-1258, June 2017, http://www.annalstho-racicsurgery.org/article/S0003-4975(17)30552-0/pdf. 60 The Ohio Department of Medicaid, Ohio Med icaid Group VIII Assessment: A Report to the Ohio General Assembly, January 2017, http://medicaid.ohio.gov/Portals/0/Resources/Reports/An-nual/Group -VIII-Assessment.pdf. 215 Medicaid coverage due to the expansion experienced a 79 perce nt reduction in out-of-pocket spending per prescription.61 State budgets may have also benefited from receiving federal matching payments for state - funded programs and reductions in payments for un- compensated care; Louisiana, for example, estimated such savings at $199 million in 2017.62 A recent na- tional study found no significant increase in state Medicaid spending, nor a decrease in education, trans- portation, or other state spending, as a result of the expansion.63 States also have not shown regret about their decisions to expand Medicaid, as indicated by reauthorizations of and public statements supporting the Medicaid expansion, even in Republican -led states.64 The health system, in particular the hospital sector, has also gained financially from the Medicaid expansion. As previously mentioned, not only has un- compensated care decreased to a greater degree in states that expanded Medicaid as compared to those 61 Mulcahy AW, Eibner C and Finegold K, Gaining Coverage through Medicaid Or Private Ins urance Increased Prescription Use And Lowered Out -Of-Pocket Spending, Health Affairs, 35(9), 2016, https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2016 .0091 62 Louisiana Department of Health, 2016/17, June 2017, http://dhh.louisian a.gov/assets/HealthyLa/Resources/ MdcdExpnAnnlRprt_2017_WEB.pdf. 63 Sommers B and Gruber J, Federal Funding Insulated State Budgets From Increased Spending Related To Medicaid Expan-sion, Health Affairs, 65(5):938-944, 2017, https://www.healthaf- fairs.org/doi /pdf/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.1666 Expanding Medicaid?

The ACA's Medicaid provisions indirectly and directly improved coverage for people with disabilities. Its expansion directly helped those who did not qualify under pre-ACA rules, including those awaiting a disa- bility determ ination. It also authorized a new eligibil- ity pathway for full Medicaid benefits for people who were previously only eligible for partial Medicaid ben- efits under home - and community -based care waivers. The law created new programs such as the Commu- nity First Choice Options as well as demonstration programs to integrate care for people eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare. Medicaid covers about 6 mil- lion low- income seniors and 10 million non-elderly people with disabilities, with these two groups ac- counting for nearly two-thirds of overall Medicaid spending. As of 2016, 17 states had adopted the ACA's option for home - and community -based services and 8 were participating in Community First Choice.66 65 Blavin F, How Has the ACA Changed Finances for Different Types of Hospitals?

The ACA modified Medicare to improve its benefits; promote quality, value -based purchasing, and alternative payment models; and lower overpay- ments and fraud in its traditional program and Medi- care Advantage. It created CMMI to develop and test new payment models which, if determined to reduce spending without harming quality of care (or to im- prove quality without increasing spending), could be adopted by Medicare nationwide. It also included spe- cific payment models as alternatives to paying for vol- ume, such as Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) and bundled payments that pay per person or episode, respectively. New quality \"star rating \" programs were expanded to inform choices. The law also raised the Medicare payroll tax for high-income people to support Medicare 's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. 28. The ACA included a major focus on preventive services (described below as well). It created an an- nual wellness visit in Medicare and eliminated cost sharing for certain evidence based preventive services. In 2016, more than 10.3 million Medicare beneficiaries had an annual wellness visit and 40.1 million used at least one preventive service w ith no copay (provisions included in the ACA). It also included a provision that would gradually close the coverage gap or \"donut hole\" in Medicare 's Part D drug benefit. Before the ACA, Medicare beneficiaries had no drug coverage after the standard benefit that ends with $2,830 in total spend- ing and its catastrophic benefit that begins with $4,550 in out-of-pocket spending (2010 values). Be- 218 cause of changes contained in the ACA, nearly 12 mil- lion Medicare beneficiaries received cumulative pre- scription drug savings from 2010 to 2016 that averaged $2,272 per person ($1,149 per beneficiary in 2016 alone).67 Research suggests the policy both re- duced out-of-pocket costs and contributed to greater use of generic drugs.68 Drug savings for Medicare - and other payers - will also flow from ACA's new path- way for approval of lower- cost \"biosimilar \" drugs. A RAND analysis estimated that this provision could re- duce U.S. health spending by $54 billion from 2017 to 2026.69 29. Most of the ACA's savings come from reducing Medicare overpayments. The ACA, for the first time, built permanent productivity adjustments into Medi- care payment formulas. The ACA also phased in new benchmark payment rates and reduced upcoding for risk in Medicare Advantage (MA). Despite concerns about an estimated 12 percentage point reduction in 67 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Nearly 12 Million People with Medicare Have Saved over $26 Billion on Prescrip- tion Drugs since 2010, Press Release, January 2017, https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/ Press releases/2017-Press-releases-items/2017-01-13.html 68 Bonakdar Tehrani A and Cunningham PJ, Closing the Medi- care Doughnut Hole: Changes in Prescription Drug Utilization and Out -of-Pocket Spending Among Medicare Beneficiaries With Part D Coverage After the Affordable Care Act, Medical Care, 55(1):43-49, 2017, https://journals.lww.com/lwwmedicalcare/Ab-stract/2017/01000/Closing_the_Medicare_Doughnut_Hole__ Changes_in.7.aspx. 69 Mulcahy AW, Hlavka JP and Case SR, Biosimilar Cost Savings in in the United States, R AND Corporation, Perspectives , 2017, https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE264.html. 219 MA rates, MA program enrollment has grown by over 70 percent and premiums have dropped since 2010.70 The ACA also included new tools and resources to com- bat health care fraud; in 2015, the government recov- ered $2.4 billion, returning $6.10 for each dollar invested, and conducted its largest ever nationwide health care fraud takedown, charging 243 people with false billing.71 30. The ACA prioritized delivery system reform to promote more efficient, high-quality care, led by Med- icare. As of 2016, nearly 30 percent of payments in Medicare and major private plans were made through new payment models, virtually none of which existed in 2010.72 In 2017, 21 percent of Medicare beneficiar- ies received care from an ACO or medical home, with another 33 percent in Medicare Advantage.73 Because 70 Jacobson G, Damico A, Neuman T and Gold M, Medicare Ad- vantage 2017 Spotlight: Enrollment Market Update, Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation , Issue Brief, June 2017, https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue -brief/medicare -advantage update/. 71 Department of Justice, Fact Sheet; The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program Protects Consumers and Taxpayers by Combating Health Care Fraud, Press Release, February 2016, Payment Learning & Action Network, Measuring Progress: Adoption of Alternative Payment Models in Comme r- cial, Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, and Fee -for-Service October 2017, https://hcplan.org/groups/ apm-fpt -work -products/apm -report/. 73 Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicare Delivery System Reform: The Evidence Link, no date, https://www.kff.org/medi- care-delivery-system -reform-the -evidence -link/. 220 these innovations are new, few evaluations have been done. Some demonstrations seem to have been suc- cessful. For example, the pioneer ACOs saved Medi- care $24 million in 2016, reduced spending by 1 to 2 percent relative to a comparison group in 2013, and had overall quality composite scores that increased over time.74 And, research has found that the bundled payments for lower extremity joint replacement re- duced readmissions while cutting average Medicare per-episode spending by 21 percen t if there were no complications and 14 percent if there were complica- tions.75 31. Medicare is on stronger financial footing be- cause of the ACA. In 2010, CBO estimated that the ACA would reduce Medicare spending by over $400 billion from 2010 to 2019.76 A study by the U.S. De- partment of Health and Human Services found Medi- care spent $473.1 billion less from 2009 to 2014 than it would have had the 2000 to 2008 average growth 74 Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicare Delivery System Reform: The Evidence Link, Side -by-Side Comparison: Medicare Accountable Care Organization (ACO) Model, no -comparisonmedi- care-accountable Liao JM, Nan N, Zhu J, Zhon W, and Emanuel EJ, Cost of Joint Replacement Using Bundled Payment Models, JAMA Intern Med., 177(2):214-22 2, 2017, https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/arti-cleabstract/2594805. 76 Elmendorf DW, Letter to Honorable Nancy Pelosi, Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives, Congressional Budget Office, March 20, 2010, https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default /files/111th - congress-2009-2010/costestimate/amendreconprop.pdf 221 rate continued.77 Reduced Medicare spending, com- bined with increased revenue, contribut ed to extend- ing the life of Medicare 's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund by 12 years (to 2029) as compared to its projected insolvency when the ACA was enacted (2017).78 The benefits of slower Medicare cost growth accrue to ben- eficiaries and states as well. In 2016, Medicare premi- ums and cost sharing for traditional Medicare were $700 lower per beneficiary compared to what such spending would have been under 2009 projections.79 States similarly have saved since they pay Medicare premiums and cost sharing for certain low-income beneficiaries.

It supports improving health system infrastructure through policies such as a new Community Health Center Fund to expand services, a program to build school- based health clinics, a permanent authoriza- tion of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, and a set of workforce policies to promote primary care and increase the number of people trained through the Na- tional Health Service Corps. It also encourages inte- gration of behavioral and primary care services through training programs as well its insurance and payment policies. 33. The required coverage of clinical preventive services has resulted in increased use of key preven- tive services such as blood pressure and cholesterol screenings and flu vaccinations.80 Insurance coverage of vaccinations and ACA investments in the Section 317 Immunization Program, totaling almost $768 mil- lion for fiscal years 2010 to 2017, have increased pro- tection against vaccine -preventable diseases among Americans. For example, women were 3.3 times as likely to have had the HPV vaccine after implementa- tion of the ACA.81Increased coverage of smoking ces- sation services under Medicaid, newly mandated 80 Han X, Yabroff KR, Guy GP, Zheng Z and Jemal A, Has Rec- ommended Preventive Service Use Increased after Elimination of Cost-Sharing as Part of the Affordable Care Act in the United States?

One analysis in Massachusetts found sav- ings of $3.12 in medical costs for every $1 spent on smoking cessation services.82 34. The Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF), a new funding stream created by the ACA, has sent over $3.9 billion to states since 2010 ($650 million for fiscal year 2017).83 This fund has supported key programs, three of which are described below in paragraphs 35-37. 35. The PPHF funded Tips from Form er Smokers , an advertising campaign to encourage quit attempts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention esti- mated that it led 500,000 people to quit smoking for good in the first five years of the campaign, with an estimated cost of $2,000 for every life saved from a smoking death.84 In addition, states have received 2017.07.002. 82 Richard P, West K and Ku L, The Return o n Investment of a Medicaid Tobacco Cessation Program in Massachusetts, PLoSONE, 7(1): e29665, 2012. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal. pone.0029665.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029665 83 Trust for America's Health, Updated Prevention and Public Healt h Fund (PPHF) State Funding Data for Disease Control and Prevention, Tips Impact and Results, no date, https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/ about/impact/campaign -impact -results.html?s_cid=OSH_tips_ D9391. 224 PPHF grants for their smoking cessation programs, totaling over $133 million since 2010. 36. The PPHF investment, including nearly $17 million in fiscal year 2017, permitted expansion of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a community - based lifestyle change program. This program has been shown to prevent progression to diabetes among many of those with prediabetes, resulting in savings and improved health outcomes. In testing by CMMI, DPP saved Medicare an estimated $2,650 for each per- son enrolled in DPP over a 15-month period.85 The Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP) is now available to all eligible beneficiaries. 37. PPHF has been critical in expanding and sus- taining the capaci ty of state and local health depart- ments to meet the needs of their communities, in particular through annual funding of the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant ($160 million a year) and Epidemiology and Laboratory Grants ($40 million a year) . The two grants combined have put over $1.1 billion into communities in fiscal years 2010 through 2017. 38. The ACA invested $1.5 billion in the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Grants to support state -level expansion of the Nurse -Famil y Partnership. This program has had a d ramatic impact on medical care, child welfare, special education, and criminal justice system involvement by the families 85 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP) Expanded Model, no date, https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/medicare -diabetes -preven- tion-program/. 225 served by the program, with a savings to government programs of 1.9 times the cost.86 39. There is growing evidence that pediatric asthma, diabetes, heart disease and other chronic con- ditions are linked with social and economic factors or conditions where people live, grow, and work.87 Through both the PPHF and CMMI, the ACA has sup- ported investments in the multi -sector partnerships that can address the health -related social needs of people served by our health system. CMMI is support- ing a $157 million initiative, Accountable Health Com- munities (AHC), in 23 states across the country as well as accounta ble communities for health models through the State Innovation Models grants in 10 states.88 Through various community prevention pro- grams supported by the PPHF's over $1 billion invest- ment from 2010 to 2017, every state has received support to build strong er partnerships across sectors that will improve the health of communities. 86 Miller, TR, Projected Outcomes of Nurse-Family Partnership Home Visitation during 1996-2013, USA., Prevention Science , 2015, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ 26076883. 87 Magnan, S, Socia l Determinants of Health 101 for Health Care: Five Plus Five.

ACA investments have also expanded the health care workforce in every state. More primary care providers are now working in teams to address complex care needs of populations. The increases are due in large part to the expansion of primary care training programs for physicians, physician assis- tants, and nurse practitioners funded through the PPHF, which added approximately 4,500 providers.89 There was also the expansion of reside ncy training programs under the ACA, such as the Teaching Health Centers program, that added approximately 1,555 primary care physicians working in shortage ar- eas. Through a $1.5 billion investment in the National Health Service Corps, the number of people served by Corps clinicians rose from 9 million in 2010 to 15.9 million in 2016. The ACA investment increased its number of health care providers from 7,358 to 15,159, including physicians, nurses, dentists, and behavior health providers serving in over 14,000 shortage area sites. Corps clinicians had an 80 percent retention rate after one year of completed service requirements. 41. The ACA invested in health care facilities as well as workers. Its Community Health Center Fund has been used, among other activities, for facility im- provement, expanded access points, and expanded s er- vice capacity.90 This Fund, plus the expansion of Medicaid, contributed to growth in the number of pa- tients served from 19.5 million in 2010 to 25.9 million 89 Health Resources and Services Administration, FY 2016 An- nual Performance Report , 2016, https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/de- fault/files/about/budget/peformancereport2016.pdf. 90 Congressional Research Service Reports, The Community Health Center Fund: In Brief , 2017, https://www.everycrsre- port.com/reports/R43911.html. 227 in 2016.91 It supported construction and renovation of school- based health clinics, providing about 520 awards.92 The ACA also authorized new programs within the Indian Health Service, including behavior health programs, and expanded subsidies in Medicaid and the Marketplaces for American Indians and Na- tive Americans.93 Enjoining the ACA Would Cause Widespread Harm in All States for the Vast Majority of Americans 42. As this review of the impact of the ACA illus- trates, enjoining the ACA would cause grievous imme- diate and long- term harm to Americans ' health and financial security, to the health system, and to federal and state budgets. The law's provisions are so inter- woven in the health system that the harms from an injunction would go far beyond negating the benefits directly traceabl e to the ACA. Some ACA policies could 91 Rosenbaum S, Tolbert J, Sharac J, Shin P, Gunsalus R and Zur J, Community Health Centers: Growing Importance in a Chang- ing Health System, Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation, Issue Brief, March 2018, http://files.kff.org/attachment/Issue -Brief Gee E, Finegold K, Amaya K and Robinson W, The Affordable Care Act and Adolescents, Office of the Assis-tant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Research Brief, Au- gust 2013, https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/180281/rb_ adolescent.pdf 93 Ross RW, Garfield LD, Brown DS and Raghavan R, The Afford- able Care Act and Implications for Health Care Services for American Indian and Alaska Native Individuals, J Health Care Poor Underserved, 26(4):1081-1088, 2015, https://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4824684/. 228 not simply fall back to what they were almost a decade ago. For example, Medicare probably could not make payments to Medicare Advantage plans pursuant to an injunction since the ACA replaced the previous payment syste m; 19 million beneficiaries could lose their plans and publicly traded insurers ' stocks could plummet. Some programs that pre-dated the ACA would cease to function under an injunction. For ex- ample, the ACA's PPHF is now the only source of sup- port for the long-standing Preventive and Public Health Services Block Grant. This grant supports crit- ical services, including lab capacity to test for out- breaks of flu or virus -borne diseases such as Zika, responses to emerging public health threats such as the opioid epidemic, and chronic health threats such as damage to children through exposure to lead.94 Be- yond the heightened threat to public health, states ' credit ratings could fall due to their increased finan- cial exposure from such funding cuts along with the loss of federal Medicaid funding.95 43. CBO acknowledged these and other chal- lenges when it estimated the implications of the full repeal of the ACA in 2015. It projected that repealing the ACA would increase th e federal budget deficit by 94 Clary A, Rosenthal J, Riley T, The Prevention and Public Health Fund - Lessons from States; Questions for Pol icymakers, National Academy for State Health Policy, State Health Policy Medicaid Cuts Could Im- pact States' Credit Ratings, Georgetown University Health Pol- icy Institute, Center for Children and Families, Say Ahhh!

Medicare spending would increase by $802 billion over this period, raising sen- iors' premiums and hastening Medicare Trust Fund insolvency. CBO projected that 24 million people would become uninsured.96 44. CBO prepared similar estimates in 2016 and early 2017 when legislation to repeal parts of the ACA (without a replacement) was under consideration. The Urban Institute found that partial repeal would in- crease in the number of uninsured by 29.8 million, of whom 82 percent would be in working families and 38 percent would be young adults. This dramatic increase in the number of uninsured would increase the cost of uncompensated care by an estimated $1.1 trillion over a decade, which would put significant budget stress on state and local governments as well as the health sys- tem.97 An analysis funded by the American Hospital Association estimated that income of hospitals would be reduced by $165.8 billion from 2018 to 2026.98 96 Congressional Budget Office, Budgetary and Economic Effects of Repealing the Affordable Care Act, June 2015, https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/50252-effectsofacarepeal.pdf 97 Blumberg LK, Buettgens M and Holahan J, Implications of Parti al Repeal of the ACA through Reconciliation, Urban 98 Associates, LLC, Estimating the Impact of Repealing the Affordable Care Act on Hospitals, 2016, American Hospital Association, Report, 2016, https://www.aha.org/sys- tem/files/2018-02/impact-repeal-aca- report_0.pdf 230 45. No analysis has systematically examined the immediate implications of an injunction of the entire law. It is not clear how Medicare would continue to make payments if the basis for those payment rates is nullified, whether states would get federal funding in the next quarter for service and eligibility categories authorized by the ACA, and if insurers no longer re- ceiving premium tax credits could immediately revert to medical underwriting. Workers in programs funded by the ACA, such as CMMI programs, may become im- mediately unemployed. Drug discounts provided to seniors with Medicare coverage could immediate cease. People with disabilities whose care is funded by Community First Choice could immediately lose ac- cess to care without state intervention. These few ex- amples illustrate that enjoining the entire ACA would create both chaos and inflict harm. State -Specific Impacts 46. Enjoining the ACA would harm the health sys- tem, public health, and budgets of states across the country. If people cannot access health coverage, more people will become uninsured, uncompensated care costs for states will increase, and states will be pres- sured to fill the void left from the ACA. The estimates described below come from four sources: (1) state f act sheets from the Department of Health and Human Services;99 (2) Urban Institute estimates of the impact of a repeal of the ACA's funding -related provisions;100 99 Office of the Assistant Secretary of Planning and Evaluation, Compilation of State Data on the Affordable Care Act, December 2016, https://aspe.hhs.gov/compilation -state -data-affordable - care-act.

California 47. Between 2010 and 2015, an estimated 3,826,000 people in California gained coverage. This includes a large fraction of the people covered in the California Health Insurance Marketplace (called Cov- ered California), an estimated 294,000 young adults who gained coverage by staying on their parents ' health insurance, and those gaining coverage from the Partial Repeal of the ACA through Reconciliation, Urban Insti- tute, Holahan J, The Impact on Health Care Providers of Partial ACA Repeal Through Reconciliation, Urban Institute, Report, January 2017, https://www.urban.org/sites/de- fault/files/publication/86916/2001046-the -impact-onhealth -care - providers-of-partial -aca-repeal-through- reconciliation_1.pdf. 101 Trust for America's Health, Updated Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) State Funding Data (FY10 for Medicar e & Medicaid Services, Nearly 12 Million People with Medicare Have Saved over $26 Billion on Prescription Drugs since 2010, Press Release, January 2017, https://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press - releases/2017-Press-releases-items/2017-01-13.html. 232 law's Medicaid (called Medi -Cal) expansion and em- ployer shared responsibility policy. This coverage would be at risk if the ACA were enjoined. 48. Impact on Consumer Protections : Numer- ous consumer protections in private insurance would also be lost if the ACA were enjoined or if there were an injunction ending the law. Up to 16,133,192 people in California have a pre-existing condition and would be at risk for being charged unaffordable premiums or denied coverage altogether without the ACA. Before the ACA, 12,092,000 people in California with em- ployer or individual market coverage had a lifetime limit on their insurance policy: annual and lifetime limits would return under an injunction to the ACA. An estimated 15,867,909 people in California, includ- ing 6,324,503 women ages 15-64, would lose federally guaranteed of preventive services \u2014 like flu shots, cancer screenings, and contraception - which are now provided at no extra cost to consumers. These are just a few of the ACA's consumer protections that could be lost if this court allows the ACA to be enjoined. 49. Impact on Marketplace Coverage : The ACA provides financial support for private coverage through premium tax credits and cost-s haring reduc- tions. If the ACA were enjoined, individuals and fami- lies that have benefitted from these provisions would pay more for health coverage or go without it alto- gether. Many of the 1,389,886 people in California cov- ered in the Health Insurance Marketplace would lose coverage without the ACA. In 2017, 85 percent of Mar- ketplace enrollees in California received a premium tax credit that averaged $4,150 per person. That fi- nancial assistance would no longer be available under an injunction. 233 50. Impact on Medicaid: Without the ACA, an es- timated 1,188,000 fewer people in California would have Medicaid coverage . The law's Medicaid expan- sion improved access to care, financial security, and health. For example, it resulted in an estimated 136,000 more getting all needed care, 169,000 fewer struggling to pay medical bills, 109,000 fewer experi- encing symptoms of dep ression, and 1,430 avoided deaths each year in California. Enjoining the law would put these benefits at risk, along with improve- ments to long- term services and supports, eligibility simplifications, and policies to lower drug costs and improve the quality of care in Medicaid. This could, for example, mean that people with disabilities in Califor- nia's Community First Choice program could lose ac- cess to services. 51. Impact on Medicare : The 5,829,777 people with Medicare in California would also lose benefits and pay more under an injunction. Prescription drug discounts, which provided 403,631 people in Califor- nia with $1,169 in average annual savings per benefi- ciary in 2016, would end. It would roll back the coverage of proven preventive services with no cost sharing which 3,879,678 people with Medicare in Cal- ifornia used in 2016. It would suspend payment poli- cies w hich would increase premiums, cost sharing, and well as taxpayer costs in California. It would also disrupt programs to reduce preventable patient harms and avoidable readmissions. Hospital readmissions for Medicare beneficiaries dropped between 2010 and 2015, which translates into 5,580 fewer unnecessary returns to the hospital in California in 2015. The 29 Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in California that offer Medicare beneficiaries the opportunity to re- ceive higher quality, more coordinated care would no longer operate under an injunction. 234 52. Impact on Public Health : Support for public health in California would also be reduced under an injunction. California received $317,998,658 from the law's Prevention and Public Health Fund between fis- cal years 2012 and 2016. This includes $61,653,559 for immunizations and $15,110,953 for tobacco cessation efforts. 53. Impact on Finances : The financ ial impact on California would be significant. From 2019 to 2028, it would lose $61.1 billion in federal Marketplace spending and $99.1 billion in federal Medicaid spend- ing. The combined loss of federal spending over this period would be $160.2 billion. This would have a ma- jor impact on health care providers. From 2019 to 2028, California hospitals could lose $64.1 billion and physicians could lose $24.7 billion. Uncompensated care costs in California would increase by $140.1 bil- lion over this period. Conne cticut 54. Between 2010 and 2015, an estimated 110,000 people in Connecticut gained coverage. This includes a large fraction of the people covered in the Connecti- cut Health Insurance Marketplace (called Ac- cessHealthCT), an estimated 25,000 young adults who gained coverage by staying on their parents ' health in- surance, and those gaining coverage from the law's Medicaid expansion and employer shared responsibil- ity policy. Th is coverage would be at risk if the ACA were enjoined. 55. Impact on Consumer Protecti ons: Numer- ous consumer protections in private insurance would also be lost if the ACA were enjoined or if there were an injunction ending the law. Up to 1,554,628 people in Connecticut have a pre-existing condition and 235 would be at risk for being charged unaffordable premi- ums or denied coverage altogether without the ACA. Before the ACA, 1,386,000 people in Connecticut with employer or individual market coverage had a lifetime limit on their insurance policy: annual and lifetime limits would return under an injunction to the ACA. An estimated 1,819,938 people in Connecticut, includ- ing 746,444 women ages 15-64, would lose federally guaranteed of preventive services \u2014 like flu shots, cancer screenings, and contraception - which are now provided at no extra cost to consumers. These are just a few of the ACA's consumer protections that could be lost if this court allows the ACA to be enjoined. 56. Impact on Marketplace Coverage: The ACA provides financial support for private coverage through premium tax credits and cost-sharing reduc- tions. If the ACA were enjoined, individuals and fami- lies that have benefitted from these provisions would pay more for health coverage or go without it alto- gether. Many of the 98,260 people in Connecticut cov- ered in the Health Insuranc e Marketplace would lose coverage without the ACA. In 2017, 77 percent of Mar- ketplace enrollees in Connecticut received a premium tax credit that averaged $5,312 per p erson. That fi- nancial assistance would no longer be available under an injunction. 57. Impact on Medicaid: Without the ACA, an estimated 72,000 fewer people in Connecticut would have Medicaid coverage. The law's Medicaid expan- sion improved access to care, financial security, and health. For example, it resulted in an estimated 8,000 more getti ng all needed care, 10,200 fewer struggling to pay medical bills, 7,000 fewer experiencing symp- toms of depression, and 90 avoided deaths each year in Connecticut. Enjoining the law would put these 236 benefits at risk, along with improvements to long- term services and supports, eligibility simplifications, and policies to lower drug costs and improve the quality of care in Medicaid. This could, for example, mean that people with disabilities in Connecticut 's Community First Choice program could lose access to services. 58. Impact on Medicare: The 644,136 people with Medicare in Connecticut would also lose benefits and pay more under an injunction. Prescription drug discounts, which provided 65,248 people in Connecti- cut with $1,268 in average annual savings per benefi- ciary in 2016, would end. It would roll back the coverage of proven preventive services with no cost sharing which 473,312 people with Medicare in Con- necticut used in 2016. It would suspend payment pol- icies which would increase premiums, cost sharing, and well as taxpayer costs in Connecticut. It would also disrupt programs to reduce preventable patient harms and avoidable readmissions. Hospital readmis- sions for Medicare beneficiaries dropped between 2010 and 2015, which translates into 1,306 fewer unneces- sary returns to the hospital in Connecticut in 2015. The 12 Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in Connecticut that offer Medicare beneficiaries the op- portunity to receive higher quality, more coordinated care would no l onger operate under an injunct ion. 59. Impact on Public Health : Support for public health in Connecticut would also be reduced under an injunction. Connecticut received $86,545,015 from the law's Prevention and Public Health Fund between fis- cal years 2012 and 2016. This includes $10,382,997 for immunizations and $971,964 for tobacco cessation ef- forts. 60. Impact on Finances: The financial impact on Connecticut would be significant. From 2019 to 237 2028, it would lose $4.3 billion in federal Marketplace spending and $10.5 billion in federal Medicaid spend- ing. The combined loss of federal spending over this period would be $14.8 billion. This would have a major impact on health care providers. From 2019 to 2028, Connecticut hospitals could lose $6.0 billion and phy- sicians could lose $2.4 billion. Uncompensated care costs in Connecticut would increase by $14.9 billion over this period. Delaware 61. Between 2010 and 2015, an estimated 35,000 people in Delaware gained coverage. This includes a large fraction of the people covered in the Delaware Health Insurance Marketplace, an estimated 7,000 young adults who gained coverage by staying on their parents ' health insurance, and those gaining coverage from the law's Medicaid expansion and employer shared responsibility policy. This coverage would be at risk if the ACA were enjoined. 62. Impact on Consumer Protections: Numer- ous consumer protections in private insurance would also be lost if the ACA were enjoined or if there were an injunction ending the law.

The combined loss of federal spending over this period would be $3.6 billion. This would have a major impact on health care providers. Fr om 2019 to 2028, Delaware hospitals could lose $1.5 billion and physi- cians could lose $500 million. Uncompensated care costs in Delaware would increase by $2.8 billion over this period. District of Columbia 68. Between 2010 and 2015, an estimated 25,000 people in the District of Columbia gained coverage. 240 This includes a large fraction of the people covered in the District of Columbia Health Insurance Market- place (called DC Health Link), an estimated 6,000 young adults who gained coverage by staying on their parents ' health insurance, and those gaining coverage from the law's Medicaid expansion and employer shared responsibility policy.

Impact on Medicare: The 881,938 people with Medicare in Kentucky would also lose benefits and pay more under an injunction. Prescription drug discounts, which provided 83,989 people in Kentucky with $1,194 in average annual savings per beneficiary in 2016, would end. It would roll back the coverage of proven preventive services with no cost sharing which 634,656 people with Medicare in Kentucky used in 2016. It would suspend payment policies which would increase premiums, cost sharing, and well as taxpayer costs in Kentucky. It would also disrupt p rograms to reduce preventable patient harms and avoidable read- missions. Hospital readmissions for Medicare benefi- ciaries dropped between 2010 and 2015, which translates into 2,384 fewer unnecessary returns to the hospital in Kentucky in 2015. The 22 Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in Kentucky that offer Medicare beneficiaries the opportunity to receive higher quality, more coordinated care would no longer operate under an injunction. 250 94. Impac t on Public Health: Support for public health in Kentucky would also be reduced under an injunction. Kentucky received $36,712,458 from the law's Prevention and Public Health Fund between fis- cal years 2012 and 2016. This includes $11,025,151 for immunizati ons and $2,112,229 for tobacco cessation efforts. 95. Impact on Finances: The financial impact on Kentucky would be significant. From 2019 to 2028, it would lose $2.9 billion in federal Marketplace spend- ing and $46.8 billion in federal Medicaid spending. The combined loss of federal spending over this period would be $49.7 billion. This would have a major im- pact on health care providers. From 2019 to 2028, Kentucky hospitals could lose $23.1 billion and physi- cians could lose $6.9 billion. Uncompensated care costs in Kentucky would increase by $15.6 billion over this period. Massachusetts 96. Between 2010 and 2015, an estimated 107,000 people in Massachusetts gained coverage. This in- cludes a large fraction of the people covered in the Massachusetts Health Insurance Marketplace (called the Massachusetts Health Connector), an estimated 52,000 young adults who gained coverage by staying on their parents ' health insurance, and those gaining coverage from the law's Medicaid expansion and em- ployer shared r esponsibil ity policy. This coverage would be at risk if the ACA were enjoined. 97. Impact on Consumer Protections: Numer- ous consumer protections in private insurance would also be lost if the ACA were enjoined or if there were an injunction ending the law. Up to 2,931,068 people in Massachusetts have a pre-existing condition and 251 would be at risk for being charged unaffordable premi- ums without the ACA. Before the ACA, 2,520,000 peo- ple in Massachusetts with employer or individual market coverage had a lifetime limit on their insur- ance policy: annual and lifetime limits would return under an injunction to the ACA. An estimated 3,399,092 people in Massachusetts, including 1,412,394 women ages 15-64, would lose federally guaranteed of preventive services \u2014 like flu shots, cancer screenings, and contraception - which are now provided at no extra cost to consumers. These are just a few of the ACA's consumer protections that could be lost if this court allows the ACA to be enjoined. 98. Impact on Marketplace Coverage: The ACA provides financial support for private coverage through premium tax credits and cost-sharing reduc- tions. If the ACA were enjoined, individuals and fami- lies that have benefitted from these provisions would pay more for health coverage or go without it alto- gether. Many of the 242,221 people in Massachusetts covered in the Health Insurance Marketplace would lose coverage without the ACA. In 2017, 74 percent of Marketplace enrollees in Massachusetts received a premium tax credit that averaged $2,135 per person. That financial assistance would no l onger be available under an injunction. 99. Impact on Medicaid: Without the ACA, an estimated 2,000 fewer people in Massachusetts would have Medicaid coverage. The law's Medicaid expan- sion improved access to care, finan cial security, and health. Enjoining the law would put these benefits at risk, along with improvements to long-term services and supports, eligibility simplifications, and policies to lower drug costs and improve the quality of care in Medicaid. 252 100. Impac t on Medicare: The 1,252,277 people with Medicare in Massachusetts would also lose bene- fits and pay more under an injunction. Prescription drug discounts, which provided 90,664 people in Mas- sachusetts with $1,194 in average annual savings per beneficiary in 2016, would end. It would roll back the coverage of proven preventive services with no cost sharing which 938,405 people with Medicare in Mas- sachusetts used in 2016. It would suspend payment policies which would increase premiums, cost sharing, and well as taxpayer costs in Massachusetts. It would also disrupt programs to reduce preventable patient harms and avoidable readmissions. Hospital readmis- sions for Medicare beneficiaries dropped between 2010 and 2015, which translates into 2,213 fewer unneces- sary returns to the hospital in Massachusetts in 2015. The 14 Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in Massachusetts that offer Medicare beneficiaries the opportunity to receive higher quality, more coordi- nated care would no longer operate under an injunc- tion. 101. Impact on Public Health: Support for public health in Massachusetts would also be reduced under an injunction. Massachusetts received $108,021,166 from the law's Prevention and Public Health Fund be- tween fiscal years 2012 and 2016. This includes $12,404,884 for immunizations and $2,147,272 for to - bacco cessation efforts. 102. Impact on Finances: The financial impact on Massachusetts would be significant. From 2019 to 2028, it would lose $5.4 billion in federal Marketplace spending and $17.2 billion in federal Medicaid spend- ing. The combined loss of federal spending over this period would be $22.5 billion. This would have a major impact on health care providers. From 2019 to 2028, 253 Massachusetts hospitals could lose $6.1 billion and physicians could lose $2.6 billion. Uncompensated care costs in Massachusetts would increase by $17.1 billion over this period. Minnesota 103. Between 2010 and 2015, an estimated 250,000 people in Minnesota gained coverage. This number in- cludes a large fraction of the people covered in the Minnesota Health Insurance Marketplace (called MNsure), an estimated 38,000 young adults who gained coverage by staying on their parents ' health in- surance, and those gaining coverage from the law's Medicaid expansion and employer shared responsibil- ity policy. This coverage would be at risk if the ACA were enjoined. 104. Impact on Consumer Protections: Numer- ous consumer protections in private insurance would also be lost if the ACA were enjoined or if there were an injunction ending the law. W ithout the ACA up to 2,318,738 people in Minnesota have a pre-existing condition and would be at risk for being charged unaf- fordable premiums or denied coverage altogether. Be- fore the ACA, 2,043,000 people in Minnesota with employer or individual market coverage had lifetime limits on their insurance policies: if the ACA were en- joined, annual and lifetime limits would surely return. An estimated 2,761,583 people in Minnesota, in clud- ing 1,075,362 women ages 15-64, would lose the fed- eral guarantee of preventi ve services \u2014 such as flu shots, cancer screenings, and contraception - which are now provided at no extra cost to consumers. These are just a few of the ACA's consumer protections that could be lost if this court allows the ACA to be en- joined. 254 105. Impact on Marketplace Coverage: The ACA provides financial support for private coverage through premium tax credits and cost-sharing reduc- tions. If the ACA were enjoined, individuals and fami- lies who have benefitted from these provisions would pay more out of pocket for health coverage or go with- out it altogether. Many of the 90,146 people in Minne- sota covered in the Health Insurance Marketplace would lose coverage without the ACA. In 2017, 70 per- cent of Marketplace enrollees in Minnesota received premium tax credits that averaged $5,220 per person. That financial assistance would no longer be available under an injunction. 106. Impact on Medicaid: Without the ACA, an estimated 36,000 fewer people in Minnesota would have Medicaid coverage. The law's Medicaid expan- sion improved access to care, financial security, and health. For example, it resulted in an estimated 4,000 more getting all needed care, 5,100 fewer struggling to pay medical bills, 3,000 fewer experiencing symptoms of depression, and 40 avoided deaths each year in Min- nesota. Enjoining the law would put these benefits at risk, along with improvements to long-term services and supports, eligibility simplifications, and policies to lower drug costs and improve the quality of care in Me dicaid. 107. Impact on Medicare: The 944,222 people with Medicare in Minnesota would also lose benefits and pay more under an injunction than they now do. Prescription drug discounts, that saved 66,930 Minne- sotans an average of $1,077 per beneficiary in 2016 would end. It would roll back the coverage of proven preventive services with no cost sharing which 604,022 people with Medicare in Minnesota used in 2016. It would suspend payment policies that have 255 lowered premiums, cost sharing, and taxpayer costs in Minnesota. It would a lso disrupt programs to reduce preventable patient harms and avoidable readmis- sions. Hospital readmissions for Medicare beneficiar- ies dropped between 2010 and 2015, which translates into 1,435 fewer unnecessary returns to the hospital in Minnesota in 2015. The 8 Accountable Care Organ- izations (ACOs) in Minnesota that offer Medicare ben- eficiaries the opportunity to receive higher quality, more coordinated care would no longer operate under an injunction. 108. Impact on Public Health: Support for public health in Minnesota would also be reduced under an injunction. Minnesota received $83,959,272 from the law's Prevention and Public Health Fund between fis- cal years 2012 and 2016. This sum includes $18,224,535 for immunizations and $3,177,506 for to- bacco cessati on efforts. 109. Impact on Finances: The financial impact on Minnesota would be significant. From 2019 to 2028, Minnesota would lose $1.9 billion in federal Market- place spending and $14.6 billion in federal Medicaid spending. The combined loss of federal s pending over this period would be $16.4 billion. Such a reduction in spending would have a major impact on health care providers. From 2019 to 2028, Minnesota hospitals could lose $7.3 billion and physicians c ould lose $2.7 billion. Uncompensated care costs in Minnesota would increase by $24.5 billion over this period. New Jersey 110. Between 2010 and 2015, an estimated 398,000 people in New Jersey gained coverage. This includes a large fraction of the people covered in the New Jersey Health Insurance Marke tplace, an estimated 59,000 256 young adults who gained coverage by staying on their parents ' health insurance, and those gaining coverage from the law's Medicaid expansion and employer shared responsibility policy. This coverage would be at risk if the ACA were enjoined. 111. Impact on Consumer Protections: Numer- ous consumer protections in private insurance would also be lost if the ACA were enjoined or if there were an injunction ending the law.

These are just a f ew of the ACA's consumer protections that could be lost if this court allows the ACA to be enjoined. 140. Impact on Marketplace Coverage: The ACA provides financial support for private coverage through premium tax credits and cost-sharing reduc- tions. If the ACA were enjoined, individuals and fami- lies that have benefitted from these provisions would pay more for health coverage or go without it alto- gether. Many of the 29,065 people in Rhode Island cov- ered in the Health Insurance Marketplace would lose 268 coverage without the ACA. In 2017, 78 percent of Mar- ketplace enrollees in Rhode Island received a premium tax credit that averaged $2,974 per person. That fi- nancial assistance would no longer be available under an injunction. 141. Impact on Medicaid: Without the ACA, an estimated 22,000 fewer people in Rhode Island would have Medicaid coverage. The law's Medicaid expan- sion improved access to care, financial security, and health. For example, it resulted in an estimated 3,000 more getting all needed care, 3,200 fewer struggling to pay medical bills, 2,000 fewer experiencing symptoms of depression, and 30 avoided deaths each year in Rhode Island. Enjoining the law would put these ben- efits at risk, along with improvements to long- term services and supports, eligibility simplifications, and policies to lower drug costs and improve the quality of care in Medicaid. 142. Impact on Medicare: The 208,324 people with Medicare in Rhode Island would also lose bene- fits and pay more under an injunction. Prescription drug discounts, which provided 14,990 people in Rhode Island with $1,004 in average annual savings per beneficiary in 2016, would end. It would roll back the coverage of proven preventive services with no cost sharing which 148,724 p eople with Medicare in Rhode Island used in 2016. It would suspend payment poli- cies which would increase premiums, cost sharing, and well as taxpayer costs in Rhode Island. It would also disrupt programs to reduce preventable patient harms and avoidable readmissions. Hospital readmis- sions for Medicare beneficiaries dropped between 2010 and 2015, which translates into 487 fewer unneces- sary returns to the hospital in Rhode Island in 2015. The 5 Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in 269 Rhode Island that offer Medicare beneficiaries the op- portunity to receive higher quality, more coordinated care would no longer operate under an injunction. 143. Impact on Public Health: Support for public health in Rhode Island would also be reduced under an injunction. Rhode Island received $34,890,537 from the law's Prevention and Public Health Fund between fiscal years 2012 and 2016. This includes $5,997,036 for immunizations and $326,347 for tobacco cessation efforts. 144. Impact on Finances: The financial impact on Rhode Island would be significant. From 2019 to 2028, it would lose $700 million in federal Market- place spending and $6.7 billion in federal Medica id spending. The combined loss of federal spending over this period would be $7.4 billion. This would have a major impact on health care providers. From 2019 to 2028, Rhode Island hospitals could lose $3.8 billion and physicians could lose $1.4 billion. Uncompensated care costs in Rhode Island would increase by $2.8 bil- lion over this period. Vermont 145. Between 2010 and 2015, an estimated 26,000 people in Vermont gained coverage. This includes a large fraction of the people covered in the Vermont Health Insurance Marketplace (called Vermont Health Connect), an estimated 5,000 young ad ults who gained coverage by staying on their parents ' health insurance, and those gaining coverage from the law's Medicaid expansion and employer shared re- sponsibility policy. This coverage would be at risk if the ACA were enjoined. 146. Impact on Consumer Protections: Numer- ous consumer protections in private insurance would 270 also be lost if the ACA were enjoined or if there were an injunction ending the law. Up to 280,727 people in Vermont have a pre-existing condition and would be at risk for being charged unaffordable premiums or de- nied coverage altogether without the ACA. Before the ACA, 215,000 people in Vermont with employer or in- dividual market coverage had a lifetime limit on their insurance policy: annual and lifetime limits would re- turn under an injunction to the ACA. An estimated 285,858 people in Vermont, including 122,892 women ages 15-64, would lose federally guaranteed of preven- tive services \u2014 like flu shots, cancer screenings, and contraception - which are now provided at no extra cost to consumers. These are just a few of the ACA's consumer protections that could be lost if this court al- lows the ACA to be enjoined. 147. Impact on Marketplace Coverage: The ACA provid es financial support for private coverage through premium tax credits and cost-sharing reduc- tions. If the ACA were enjoined, individuals and fami- lies that have benefitted from these provisions would pay more for health coverage or go without it alto- gether. Many of the 29,088 people in Vermont covered in th e Health Insurance Marketplace would lose cov- erage without the ACA. In 2017, 76 percent of Market- place enrollees in Vermont received a premium tax credit that averaged $3,898 per person. That financial assistance would no longer be available under an in- junction. 148. Impact on Medicaid: Without the ACA, an estimated 3,000 fewer people in Vermont would have Medicaid coverage. The law's Medicaid expansion im- proved access to care, financial security, and healt h. Enjoining the law would put these benefits at risk, along with improvements to long- term services and 271 supports, eligibility simplifications, and policies to lower drug costs and improve the quality of care in Medicaid. 149. Impact on Medicare: The 136,021 people with Medicare in Vermont would also lose benefits and pay more under an injunction. Prescription drug dis- counts, which provided 10,466 people in Vermont with $1,206 in average annual savings per beneficiary in 2016, would end. It would roll back the coverage of proven preventive services with no cost sharing which 94,170 people with Medicare in Vermont used in 2016. It would suspend payment policies which would in- crease premiums, cost sharing, and well as taxpayer costs in Vermont. It would also disrupt programs to reduce preventable patient harms and avoidable read- missions. Hospital readmissions for Medicare benefi- ciaries dropped between 2010 and 2015. The 3 Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in Vermont that offer Medicare beneficiaries the opportunity to re- ceive higher quality, more coordinated care would no longer operate under an injunction. 150. Impact on Public Health: Support for public health in Vermont would also be reduced under an in- junction. Vermont received $16,564,102 from the law's Prevention and Public Health Fund between fiscal years 2012 and 2016. This includes $2,706,809 for im- munizations and $2 99,828 for tobacco cessation ef- forts. 151. Impact on Finances: The financial impact on Vermont would be significant. From 2019 to 2028, it would lose $1.0 billion in federal Marketplace spend- ing and $1.9 billion in federal Medicaid spending. The combined loss of federal spending over this period would be $2.9 billion. This would have a major impact on health care providers. From 2019 to 2028, Vermont 272 hospitals could lose $500 million and physicians could lose $300 million. Uncompensated care costs in Ver- mont would increase by $2.4 billion over this period. Virginia 152. Between 2010 and 2015, an estimated 327,000 people in Virginia gained coverage. This includes a large fraction of the people covered in the Virginia Health Insurance Marketplace, an estimated 59,000 young adults who gained coverage by staying on their parents ' health insurance, and those who gained cov- erage due to the employer shared responsibility policy. This coverage would be at risk if the ACA were en- joined. 153. Impact on Consumer Protections: Numer- ous consumer protections in private insurance would also be lost if the ACA were enjoined or if there were an injunction ending the law. Up to 3,491,076 people in Virginia have a pre-existing condition and would be at risk for being charged unaffordable premiums or de- nied coverage altogether without the ACA. Before the ACA, 2,974,000 people in Virginia with employer or individua l market coverage had a lifetime limit on their insurance policy: annual and lifetime limits would return under an injunction to the ACA. An esti- mated 3,902,716 people in Virginia, including 1,587,663 women ages 15-64, w ould lose federally guaranteed of preventive services \u2014 like flu shots, cancer screenings, and contraception - which are now provided at no extra cost to consumers. These are just a few of the ACA's consumer protections that could be lost if this court allows the ACA to be enjoined. 154. Impact on Marketplace Coverage: The ACA provides financial support for private coverage 273 through premium tax credits and cost-sharing reduc- tions. If the ACA were enjoined, individuals and fami- lies that have benefitted from these provisions would pay more for h ealth coverage or go without it alto- gether. Many of the 364,614 people in Virginia covered in the Health Insurance Marketplace would lose cov- erage without the ACA. In 2017, 83 percent of Market- place enrollees in Virginia received a premium tax credit that averaged $3,807 per person. That financial assistance would no longer be available under an in- junction. 155. Impact on Medicaid: Virginia is debating expanding Medicaid under the ACA, which could lead to an estimated 179,000 people in Virginia gaining coverage. This would improve access to care, financial security, and health. For example, it could result in an estimated 20,000 more getting all needed care, 25,500 fewer struggling to pay medical bills, 16,000 fewer ex- periencing symptoms of depression, and 220 avoided deaths each year in Virginia. Enjoining the law would put these potential benefits at risk, along with im- provements to long- term services and supports, eligi- bility simplifications, and policies to lower drug costs and improve the quality of care in Medicaid. 156. Impact on Medicare: The 1,392,261 people w ith Medicare in Virginia would also lose benefits and pay more under an injunction. Prescription drug dis- counts, which provided 109,517 people in Virginia with $1,104 in average annual savings per beneficiary in 2016, would end. It would roll back the coverage of proven preventive services with no cost sharing which 1,026,111 people with Medicare in Virginia used in 2016. It would suspend payment policies which would increase premiums, cost sharin g, and well as taxpayer 274 costs in Virginia. It would also disrupt programs to re- duce preventable patient harms and avoidable read- missions. Hospital readmissions for Medicare beneficiaries dropped between 2010 and 2015, which translates into 2,302 fewer unne cessary returns to the hospital in Virginia in 2015. The 25 Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in Virginia that offer Medicare beneficiaries the opportunity to receive higher quality, more coordinated care would no longer operate under an injunction. 157. Impact on Public Health: Support for public health in Virginia would also be reduced under an in- junction. Virginia received $79,675,902 from the law's Prevention and Public Health Fund between fiscal years 2012 and 2016. This includes $15,357,774 for immunizations and $3,545,823 for tobacco cessation efforts. 158. Impact on Finances: The financial impact on Virginia would be significant. From 2019 to 2028, it would lose $15.4 billion in federal Marketplace spending and $2.6 billion in federal Medicaid spend- ing. The combined loss of federal spending over this period would be $18.0 billion. This would have a major impact on health care providers. From 2019 to 2028, Virginia hospitals could lose $7.8 billion and physi- cians could lose $3.7 billion. Uncompensa ted care costs in Virginia would increase by $28. 7 billion over this period. Washington 159. Between 2010 and 2015, an estimated 537,000 people in Washington gained coverage. This includes a large fraction of the people covered in the Washing- ton Health Insurance Marketplace (called Washington Healthplanfinder), an estimated 50,000 young adults 275 who gained coverage by staying on their parents ' health insurance, and those gaining coverage from the law's Medicaid expansion and employer shared re- sponsibility policy. This coverage would be at risk if the ACA were enjoined. 160. Impact on Consumer Protections: Numer- ous consumer protections in private insurance would also be lost if the ACA were enjoined or if there were an injunction ending the law. Up to 2,969,739 people in Washington have a pre-existing condition and would be at risk for being charged unaffordable premi- ums or denied coverage altogether without the ACA. Before the ACA, 2,427,000 people in Washington with employer or individual market coverage had a lifetime limit on their insurance policy: annual and lifetime limits would return under an injunction to the ACA. An estimated 3,079,369 people in Washington, includ- ing 1,258,201 women ages 15-64, would lose federally guaranteed of preventive services \u2014 l ike flu shots, cancer screenings, and contraception - which are now provided at no extra cost to consumers. These are just a few of the ACA's consumer protections that could be lost if this court allows the ACA to be enjoined. 161. Impact on Marketplace Coverage: The ACA p rovides financial support for private coverage through premium tax credits and cost-sharing reduc- tions. If the ACA were enjoined, individuals and fami- lies that have benefitted from these provisions would pay more for health coverage or go without it alto- gether. Many of the 184,070 people in Washington cov- ered in the Health Insurance Marketplace would lose coverage without the ACA. In 2017, 63 percent of Mar- ketplace enrollees in Washington received a premium 276 tax credit that averaged $3,040 per person. That fi- nancial assistance would no longer be available under an injunction. 162. Impact on Medicaid: Without the ACA, an estimated 55,000 fewer people in Washington would have Medicaid coverage. The law's Medicaid expan- sion improved access to care, financial security, and health. For example, it resulted in an estimated 6,000 more getting all needed care, 7,800 fewer struggling to pay medical bills, 5,000 fewer experiencing symptoms of depression, and 70 avoided deaths each year in Washington. Enjoining the law would put these bene- fits at risk, along with improvements to long- term ser- vices and supports, eligibility simplifications, and policies to lower drug costs and improve the quality of care in Medicaid. This could, for example, mean that peop le with disabilities in Washington 's Community First Choice program could lose access to services. 163. Impact on Medicare: The 1,238,649 people with Medicare in Washington would also lose benefits and pay more under an injunction. Prescription drug discou nts, which provided 71,499 people in Washing- ton with $1,065 in average annual savings per benefi- ciary in 2016, would end. It would roll back the coverage of proven preventive services with no cost s haring which 805,142 people with Medicare in Wash- ington used in 2016. It would suspend payment poli- cies which would increase premiums, cost sharing, and well as taxpayer costs in Washington. It would also disrupt programs to reduce preventable patient harms and avoidable readmissions. Hospital readmis- sions for M edicare beneficiaries dropped between 2010 and 2015, which translates into 1,388 fewer unneces- sary returns to the hospital in Washington in 2015. The 6 Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in 277 Washington that offer Medicare beneficiaries the op- portunity to receive higher quality, more coordinated care would no longer operate under an injunction. 164. Impact on Public Health: Support for public health in Washington would also be reduced under an injunction. Washington received $84,038,862 from the law's Prev ention and Public Health Fund between fis- cal years 2012 and 2016. This includes $21,648,368 for immunizations and $4,207,707 for tobacco cessation efforts. 165. Impact on Finances: The financial impact on Washington would be significant. From 2019 to 2028, it would lose $4.7 billion in federal Marketplace spending and $38.1 billion in federal Medicaid spend- ing. The combined loss of federal spending over this period would be $42.8 billion. This would have a major impact on health care providers. From 2019 to 2028, Washington hospitals could lose $23.3 billion and phy- sicians could lose $7.7 billion. Uncompensated care costs in Washington would increase by $33.9 billion over this period. Conclusion 166. Based on my knowledge and experience, I be- lieve that invalidating the Affordable Care Act would cause significant harm to the nation, across all States, to the economy and to the health insurance market. It would immediately end federal support for Medicaid co verage for nearly 12 million individuals in 32 states and the District of Columbia; it would deprive resi- dents of the remaining states of the option to expand Medicaid coverage, an option that is under active de- bate in Virginia, Maine, and others, of broadening cov- erage in the future; it would reduce access to coverage 278 for low and middle income Americans; it would in- crease drug costs. Further, the disruption caused by such an occurrence would cause immediate financial harm to medical providers and insurance companies, and significantly disrupt their ability to conduct busi- ness across all healthcare markets , including individ- ual, Medicaid and Medicare , and small group markets.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET declare: 1. I am a Research Professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms (CHIR) at Georgetow n University 's Health Policy Institute. At CHIR, I direct research on health insurance reform issues. My areas of focus include state and federal regulation of private health insurance plans and markets and evolving in- surance market rules. I have published numerous pa- pers relating to the regulation of private health insurance and health insurance marketplaces. I also serve on the Standards Committee for the National Committee for Quality Assurance. Prior to joining the Georgetown faculty, I was Director of Health Policy Programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families, where I provided policy expertise and stra- tegic direction for the organization 's advocacy on health care reform, with a particular focus on insur- ance market reform, benefit design, an d the quality 280 and affordability of health care. I also served as an at- torney at Hogan Lovells, during which time I advised clients on health insurance, health finance, and food and drug regulatory matters. 2. Since 2010, I have authored over 25 research papers about the Affordable Care Act and its imple- mentation. I have been invited to testify as an Afford-able Care Act expert before seven congressional committees (U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate) in the last five years. The California General Assembly invited me in January 2018 to testify about the status of the individual health insurance market. I regularly provide technical assistance to state de-partments of insurance, state policymakers, and other health care organizations regarding Afforda ble Care Act regulations and guidance and their impact on con- sumers and other health care stakeholders. I am fre- quently consulted by journalists seeking Affordable Care Act expertise, and have been quoted numerous times on health insurance and Affordable C are Act is- sues in national and local print, radio, web -based, and television media. A full list of my publications and me-dia is available on our website at https://chir. georgetown.edu. 3. I understand that this lawsuit involves a chal- lenge to the Affordab le Care Act and seeks to enjoin it. In my expert opinion, enjoining the Affordable Care Act would cause significant disruption to the U.S. health care market, resulting in harm to patients, pro- viders, insurance carriers, and federal and state gov- ernments. 4. The Affordable Care Act was enacted in part to correct serious deficiencies in the individual health insurance market that left millions uninsured and millions more with inadequate coverage that failed to 281 protect them from serious financial harm if and when they got sick. In order to assess the effect the Afforda- ble Care Act has had on the individual insurance mar- ket today, it is important to understand the market that Congress was seeking to change when it enacted the Affordable Care Act in 2010. 5. Prior to implementation of the Affordable Care Act 's market reforms, approximately 48 million Americans lacked health insurance.1 Those without health insurance have a lower life expectancy than those with coverage. Before the Affordable Care Act was enacted, an estimated 22,000 people per year died prematurely because they lacked insurance.2 This is likely because the uninsured are more than six times as likely as the privately insured to delay or forego needed care due to costs. For example, uninsured can- cer patients are more than five times more likely than their insured counterparts to forego cancer treatment due to cost. 3 1 DeNavas -Walt C, Proctor BD, Smith J.

In 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was en- acted, sixty percent of the uninsured reported having problems with medical bills or medical debt.4 7. Additionally, prior to the Affordable Care Act, the high and rising uninsured rate led to high and ris- ing uncompensated care costs for providers, in 2009 estimated at $1000 worth of servic es per uninsured person. 5 Providers ultimately passed those costs onto insured consumers and taxpayers. 8. Before the Affordable Care Act, approximately 19 million Americans purchased coverage in the indi-vidual insurance market because they lacked access t o employer- based insurance or were not eligible for pub- lic programs such as Medicare or Medicaid. 6 The indi- vidual insurance market was an inhospitable place, particularly for anyone in less than perfect health. An estimated 133 million Americans have at le ast one pre-existing condition that could threaten their access to health care and health insurance. 7 4 Cunningham, P. and Sommers, A.

Prior to the Affordable Care Act, in most states, applicants for health insurance could be denied a policy because of their health status, or charged more in premiums based on their health and gender, along with a number of other factors. Insurers could also issue policies that didn 't cover critical medical services like pharmacy benefits, mental health or sub- stance use treatment, maternity, or any of th e care re- quired to treat a person 's pre -existing condition. In addition, insurers often rescinded an individual 's cov- erage if they got sick after enrolling in the plan, and many plans imposed annual or lifetime dollar limits on covered benefits.8 10. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, coverage was often simply not available to many individuals apply-ing for coverage. One of the many ways insurers max-imized revenue was through aggressive underwriting practices resulting in a denial of coverage to individu- als posing a potential health risk. 9 In most states, when an individual wanted to buy health insurance, they had to fill out and submit a voluminous applica- tion that included detailed information about their health history and status. Insurers would then review the individual' s application and assess the likelihood he or she would incur future health costs. A Pre-ExistingConditions.pdf. 8 Corlette S, Volk J, Lucia K.

Available at https://www.gpo.gov/ fdsys/pkg/CHRG -113shrg95186/html/CHRG -113shrg95186.htm. 284 Georgetown University study found that even people with minor health care conditions, such as hay fever, could be turned down for coverage.10 Health insurer s maintained underwriting guidelines that listed as many as 400 separate medical conditions that could trigger a denial of coverage.11 11. A U.S. Government Accountability (GAO) study in 2011 found that average insurer denial rates were 19 percent, but they varied dramatically market - to-market and insurer -to- insurer. For example, across six insurers in one state, denial rates ranged from 6 percent to 40 percent. 12 In practice, access to coverage for people with pre- existing conditions was probably less avail able than this study suggests, because of a common industry practice known as \"street underwrit- ing,\" in which an insurance agent or broker would ask a potential applicant questions about their health sta-tus, and discourage them from applying if they posed a health risk. These underwriting practices were banned by the Affordable Care Act in 2014. 12. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, it was not un- common for insurers to rescind coverage after they had accepted an applicant. If an enrollee had any health 10 Pollitz K, Sorian R.

If they found evidence that their condition was a pre - existing one and not fully disclosed during the initial underwriting process, the company would de ny the relevant claims and rescind or cancel the coverage.13 The Affordable Care Act prohibited this practice ex-cept in clear cases of fraud by the policyholder. 13. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, individual in- surance was often unaffordable. Unlike those with em- ployer sponsored coverage or in public programs like Medicare or Medicaid, people with individual insur- ance must pay the full cost of their premium. Accord-ing to one national survey prior to the Affordable Care Act, 31 percent of individual market respondents spent 10 percent or more of their income on premium costs. 14 14. Prior to the Affordable Care Act the cost of pre- miums caused many individuals to forego coverage completely. A national survey found that nearly three - quarters (73 percent) of people seeking coverage in the individual market did not end up buying a plan, most often because the premium was too high. The coverage was least affordable for those individuals who needed it the most - people with pre- existing conditions. The 13 Girion L.

Prior to the Affordable Care Act, older and less healthy individuals had to pay more for coverage be-cause health insurers would segment their enrollees into different groups and charge them different prices based on their health or other risk factors. In practice, this meant that people would be charged more because of a pre -existing condition (even if they had been symptom- free for years), because of their age, gender (insurers assume women use more health care ser-vices than men), family size, geographic location, the work they do, and even their lifestyle. 16 A Georgetown University study of insurers ' rating practices before the Affordable Care Act found rate variation of more than nine -fold for the same policy based on age and health status. In many states, people in their early six- ties would be charged as much as six time s the pre- mium of someone in their early twenties, based on age alone. Even young people, when rated based on health 15 Doty MM, Collins SR, Nicholson JL, Rustg i SG.

Under the Affordable Care Act, using health status and gender to set premium r ates is prohibited. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides low - and moderate -income people between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty line with subsidies to help defray their premium costs. In 2018, the average monthly premium tax credit is $550, resulting in an average monthly premium for consumers receiving a premium tax credit of $89. 18 17. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, coverage in the individual market was often inadequate to meet people' s health care needs. In addition to paying more in premiums, people in the individual market also spent a larger share of their income on cost -sharing than those with employer -sponsored coverage. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, people in the individual mar-ket were more than twice as likely to be consi dered \"underinsured \" than those in an employer plan. 19 Someone is considered \" underinsured \" when they have insurance but because of high deductibles, high 17 Pollitz K, Sorian R .

Prior to the Affordable Care Act, a primary reason people buying individual insurance coverage had high out -of-pocket costs was that many individual plans - over half according to one study - did not meet minimum standar ds for coverage. 20 Coverage in the individual market was inadequate for a number of rea- sons, including: 19. Pre-existing condition exclusions: in many states, insurers were permitted to permanently or for a period of time exclude from covered benefits treat-ments for any health problem that a consumer dis- closed on their application. This practice was banned under the Affordable Care Act. 20. Benefit exclusions: Insurers in the individual market often sold policies that did not cover basic ben-efits such as mat ernity care, prescription drugs, men- tal health, and substance use treatment services. For example, 20 percent of adults with individual insur- ance lacked coverage for prescription medicines before the Affordable Care Act. 21 The Affordable Care Act re- quires i ndividual market insurers to cover a minimum set of essential health benefits that includes maternity 20 Gabel JR et al.

High out -of-pocket costs: Prior to the Afforda- ble Care Act, individual in surance policies often came with high deductibles - $10,000 or more was not un- common - and high cost-sharing. In fact, deductibles were often three times what they were in employer - sponsored plans.22 As a result, many individual insur- ance plans were extremely low -value. One study found that individual policies paid for just 55 percent of the expenses for covered services, compared to 83 percent for small employer group plans. 23 The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to meet a minimum adequacy of coverage s tandard of 60 percent (meaning that on av- erage, the plan must cover 60 percent of an average enrollee' s covered health care costs). The law also helps protect consumers from catastrophic medical costs by capping their annual out -of-pocket spending (for 2018, the annual cap is $7350 per individual). 22. Lifetime or annual dollar limits on coverage: Prior to enactment of the Affordable Care Act, an esti- mated 102 million people were in plans with a lifetime limit on benefits and about 20,000 people hit those limits every year. An estimated 18 million people were in plans with annual dollar limits on their benefits. For people with serious high cost medical conditions, 22 McDevitt R et al.

The Affordable Care Act ushered in bans on lifetime and annual dollar limits. 23. Among Congress ' goals for the Affordable Care Act were to extend affordable, adequate health insur- ance coverage to more people and to correct many of the dysf unctions of the individual market, described above. Congress tried to achieve these goals through a three -pronged strategy: 24. (1) Insurance reforms to help people locked out of the system due to pre- existing conditions; 25. (2) An individual mandate to e ncourage healthy people to enroll in the insurance pool and keep premiums stable; and 26. (3) Subsidies to help people afford the insur- ance coverage (with Medicaid expansion available for people under 138 percent of the federal poverty line). The Affordable Care Act also created state -based in- surance marketplaces where people can apply for the subsidies and shop for plans. 27. To a significant degree, the Affordable Care Act has achieved its goals. It has expanded access to insurance coverage, improved heal th outcomes, and improved families ' financial security. 28. Under the Affordable Care Act, the percentage of people uninsured declined from 14.5 percent in 2013 to 9.1 percent in 2017. An estimated 20 million people gained insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act. 24 24 Cohen RA, Zammitti EP, Martinez ME. H ealth Insurance Cov- 291 29. The goal of expanding coverage is ultimately to improve people' s health outcomes and their finan- cial security in the event of an unexpected illness or injury. The Affordable Care Act's reforms were fully implemented in 2014, so i t is still relatively early to try to assess the law 's impact on access to care, health outcomes, and financial security. However, data are emerging to suggest the law is having a significant positive impact. 30. Since enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the percentage of Americans reporting that they didn 't see a doctor or fill a prescription because they couldn 't afford it has declined by more than one -third. 25 Fur- ther, more people are reporting that they have a pri-mary care doctor or have had a check -up in the last 12 months. 26 31. Research to date also strongly suggests that expanding access to coverage leads to better health outcomes.

In addition to improving access to care, health insurance also provides financial security, particu- larly in the event of a large, unanticipated medical ex- pense . Unfortunately, in this country, health care is extremely expensive. For example, the average cost of a single MRI is $1,119. An uncomplicated hospital la- bor and delivery costs an average of $10,808, while a C-section will average over $16,000. One course of treatment for colon cancer will cost between $21,000 and $52,000. Yet over half of American families report that they would not be able to afford to pay just $500 in cash for an unexpected expense. 29 27 Van Der Wees, PJ, et al.

Research suggests that the Affordable Care Act is helping to improve the financial security of the newly insured. Survey data show that the number of families who say they are having problems paying medical bills has fallen dramatically since 2013, par- ticularly among low - and moderate -income families. 30 Other studies have shown that the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion has led to reductions in the amount of debt sent to collection agencies and im- provements in families ' credit scores.31 34. The Affordable Care Act has also helped re- duce uncompensated care costs borne by providers. For example, hospital -based uncompensated care fell by over 25 percent between 2013 and 2015, and in Medicaid expansion states it has fallen by closer to 50 percent.32 35. Unfortunately, much of the progress under the Afforda ble Care Act is at risk due to recent federal pol- icy decisions designed to roll back key provisions of the law and bypass consumer protections. Ultimately, some of these decisions are likely to result in many consumers facing higher premiums and fewer plan choices in the individual insurance market. 30 Karpman, M and Long, S. 9.4 Million Fewer Families Are Hav- ing Problems Paying Medical Bills, Urban Institute, May 2015.

A stable health insurance market depends on a large risk pool that is reasonably balanced between healthy individuals and sicker ones. The Affordable Care Act had a \" three -prong \" strategy designed to fa- cilitate such a stable insurance market by requiring all participating insurers to play by the same rules and, through subsidies and the individual mandate, encourage healthy people to become insured before they get sick. 37. The Affordable Care Act marketplace s had a rocky early start, but that was not unexpected given that insurers had little knowledge of the new popula- tion of people they were covering, leading many to make significant adjustments to their business strat- egy as they gained more experience and d ata about their enrollees. In addition, unanticipated Congres- sional actions, such as the dramatic reduction in fund- ing for a key premium stabilization program (the \" risk corridor\" program) resulted in significant financial losses for many insurers. 38. Specifically, the Affordable Care Act included three programs intended to ensure that premiums re-main stable, both during the initial years of the law 's implementation and over the long term. These are the risk corridors, reinsurance, and risk adjustment pro-grams - often called the \" 3Rs.\" The risk corridor pro- gram in particular was a temporary program designed to provide a buffer for insurers that did not adequately price their plans due to a lack of data about the health risk of the newly insured population i n the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. 39. The risk corridor program works by requiring the federal government (through the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services or HHS) to partially re- 295 imburse insurers whose premium revenue was insuf- ficient to pay cl aims. Insurers whose premium reve- nue exceeded their claims were required to pay HHS a fraction of the excess premium. 33 40. In the first two years of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, many insurers set relatively low premiums in order to capture more ma rket share. In late 2014, long after insurers ' pricing decisions were made, a Congressional appropriations bill dramati-cally limited the funds available to HHS to compen-sate insurers for significant losses. 34 41. Because more insurers experienced losses than gains in the first two years of the marketplaces, HHS was able to pay insurers only 12.6 percent of the risk corridor payments they were owed.35 This decision had a serious financial impact on insurers, resulting in an estimated $12.3 billion in losses,36 and likely ac- celerated the demise of several small, non -profit CO - OP health plans.37 33 42 U.S.C. \u00a718062. 34 Pub.

The loss of risk corridor funds contributed to the significant premium increases many insurers im- plemented for plan year 2016. However, it is notewor- thy that premiums i n the individual market were still often below or close to those in the employer -sponsored insurance market in 2016.38 Given that Affordable Care Act individual market benefit plans are designed to be similar to a typical employer plan, this suggests that d uring the first two years of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces (2014 and 2015), many insurers had underpriced their products in an effort to gain market share. Many of these same insurers subsequently left the Affordable Care Act market because they wer e un- able to compete with insurers that had been more suc-cessful in projecting a premium rate that would allow them to cover their costs. 39 43.

Unfortunately, my own review of insurers pre- mium rate justifications (referred to as actuarial mem-oranda) for plan years 2018 and 2019 found that recent policy changes are putting the stability of the individual market at risk. 43 Specifically: 40 Banerjee D.

We Read Actuarial Memoranda so You Don't Have to: Trends fr om Early Health Plan Rate Available at S. Proposed Premium Rates for 2018: What do Early Insurance 298 45. The Trump administration 's decision in Octo- ber of 2017 to cut off reimbursement to insurers for low cost -sharing plans (called cost -sharing reduction or CSR plans) resulted in significant premiu m in- creases in 2018. Additionally, the uncertainty about that decision, which the President had been threaten- ing for months, was a contributing factor for some in- surers to either exit the marketplaces or reduce their service areas. 46. For example, in its 2018 rate filing in Virginia, Anthem informed the state: \" A lack of CSR funding in- troduces a level of volatility which compromises the ability to set rates responsibly. It has been estimated that lack of CSR funding could increase premium rates for Silver plans an additional 20 percent... \" An- them went on to say that if CSR reimbursements were not guaranteed for 2018, it would consider exiting the marketplaces, reducing service areas, or requesting additional rate increases. 47. Additionally, although Congress did not zero out the individual mandate penalty until 2019, many insurers increased premiums for 2018 coverage on the expectation that the Trump administration would not enforce the individual mandate. For example, in its Maryland filing for 2018, CareFir st Blue Cross BlueShield stated: \" we have assumed that the cover- age mandate introduced by the ACA will not be en-forced in 2018 and that this will have the same impact as repeal. Based on industry and government esti- Company Filings Tell Us? CHIRblo early -filings - tell-us/. 299 mates as well as actuarial judgment, we h ave pro- jected that this will cause morbidity to increase by an additional 20%. \" 48. Other insurers are projecting the effect of the individual mandate repeal to be felt in 2019. For ex-ample, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan projects that premiums will need to increase 32.1 percent in Vir- ginia. \"The primary cause, \" the company reports, is \"related to nonenforcement of the Individual Man- date. \" 49. Similarly, insurers increased premiums due to the Trump administration 's decision to decrease spending on marketplac e advertising and consumer assistance, which are critical for educating and enrol- ling the healthy uninsured. For example, a Cigna fil- ing for 2018 noted that they expected a smaller and sicker population in their risk pool due to the lower \"overall awarenes s of individual health insurance products. \" 50. Going into 2019, insurers are also predicting that their risk pools will be smaller and sicker due to \"potential movement into other markets. \" These mar- kets include association health plans and short -term, limited duration insurance, both of which are exempt from many of the Affordable Care Act 's consumer pro- tections and are being promoted by the Trump admin- istration as cheaper alternative coverage. For example, insurers such as Optima and CareFirst in Virginia note that the \" availability of association health plans and expanded availability of short -term medical plans \" was affecting their rate projections, with CareFirst adding 10 percent to its premium in- crease as a result. 300 51. Individuals who are eligible fo r the Affordable Care Act 's premium tax credits are largely insulated from these premium increases because the tax credit rises, dollar for dollar, with the increase in premium for silver level health plans. The people who suffer the most from these premium increases are the working middle class: entrepreneurs who run their own busi-nesses, freelancers and consultants, independent con- tractors, farmers and ranchers, and early retirees who earn too much to qualify for the Affordable Care Act 's premium subsidies. 52. Granting the plaintiffs ' request to enjoin the Affordable Care Act amounts to an effort to repeal the law without any clear public policy to replace it. Con- gress explicitly rejected repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement last year. This is because uprooting a complex law that has been in place for over eight years, touches almost every facet of our health care system, and includes many provisions with widespread bipartisan support (such as allowing young adults to stay on their paren ts' plans until age 26, closing the Medicare drug benefit \" donut hole, \" and expanding Medicaid) will inevitably result in dramatic negative consequences, some of which are predictable, and outlined below. 53. First, millions of individuals will lose their in- surance coverage. In 2017, the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that repealing the Affordable Care Act without imple- menting a replacement would result in 32 million peo-ple losing coverage by 2026, with 17 million peop le losing coverage in the first year after repeal. 44 44 Congressional Budget Office. Cost Estimate: H.R. 1628, 301 54. Second, those remaining in the individual market would see their premiums roughly double. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that individ- ual market premiums would increase by 25 percent in the first year after repeal, by 50 percent by 2020, and almost double by 2026. 45 These premium increases are largely the result in the elimination of the individual mandate and the Affordable Care Act premium subsi- dies, resulting in fewer healthy individuals en rolling in individual market coverage and a costlier risk pool for insurers. 55. Third, even a partial repeal of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act would primarily harm working middle class Americans. The majority of peo- ple losing coverage - as many as 82 percent - would be in working families. Over half would be non -His- panic whites, and up to 80 percent would not have col-lege degrees. Thirty -eight percent would be young adults between ages 18 and 34. 46 56. Fourth, repealing the Affordable Care Act wi ll have significant negative consequences for public health and safety. For example, the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center found that repealing the Medicaid expansion and Affordable Care Act tax Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017 46 Blumberg L, Buettgens M, Holahan J. Implications of Partial Repeal of the ACA Through Reconciliation , Urban Institute, Dec. 2016. -repeal -of-the subsidies would result in 3,425 premature deaths e ach year in that state alone.47 Researchers from Harvard and New York University found that re-pealing the Affordable Care Act would result in 1.25 million Americans with serious mental conditions los- ing coverage. They further estimate that 2.8 million Ameri cans with a substance use disorder, including roughly 222,000 with an opioid -related disorder, would lose coverage. 48 57. Fifth, repealing the Affordable Care Act will drive insurance companies out of the individual mar- ket. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that legislation repealing the Affordable Care Act would leave an estimated three- fourths the nation 's popula- tion in areas where no insurers are willing to offer nongroup coverage by 2026. 49 These estimates align with my own research at Georgetown, in which col- leagues and I conducted interviews with 13 health in-surance company executives participating in the individual markets in 28 states. In those interviews, executives told us they would \" seriously consider \" a market withdrawal; they further told us that a bill re- pealing the Affordable Care Act without an immediate 47 Stier M.

Sixth, an increase in the uninsured will im- pose significant financial harm on hospitals and other health care providers. For example, repealing the Af-fordable Care Act without a replacement was esti-mated to cost the nation 's public hospitals $54.2 billion in uncompensated care charges between 2018 and 2026. 51 The Iowa Fiscal Partnership estimated that Affordable Care Act repeal would result in a $10 bil- lion increase in the cost of uncompensated care in that state alone, with most of the burden borne by rural hospitals. 52 59. Seventh, repeal of the Affordable Care Act would lead to significant negative economic conse-quences. For example, repealing just the Medicaid ex- pansion and Affordable Care Act tax credits would result in an estimated loss of 2.6 million jobs across the country. 53 State -specific analyses align with these 50 Corlette S, Lucia K, Giovannelli J, Palanker D.

For example, the University of California at Berkley' s Center for Labor Research and Education found that just a partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act would cause California to suffer 209,000 lost jobs, $20.3 billion in lost gross domes tic product, and $1.5 billion lost in state and local tax revenue. 54 Arizona State University 's Seidman Research Institute simi- larly found that if Arizona lost federal Affordable Care Act funding, it would leave a $5 billion dent in the state 's economy, cos t over 62,000 jobs state wide, and lower personal income by almost $3.5 billion.55 60. Eighth, and finally, a full repeal of the Afford- able Care Act would not only harm the individual in-surance market. Other programs would be harmed as well. For example, repealing the law is estimated to accelerate the insolvency of the Medicare Hospital In- surance Trust Fund (Part A) by five years, from 2026 to 2021. 56 Health Reform: Economic and Employment Consequences for States, The Commo nwealth , Jan. 2017.

The plaintiff 's suggestion that the Affordable Care Act be enjoined ignores the serious negative con- sequ ences of an a ction that would be tantamount to repealing the law without any clear federal policy to replace it. When such a strategy was proposed last year to Congress, it was rejected because of the serious economic and public health barbs that would res ult, including: millions of Americans losing coverage, pre- miums doubling, insurers exiting the market, and the costs of uncompensated care putting providers at seri-ous financial risk. Repeal -without -replace would also result in heavy job and productivity l osses. These are serious adverse repercussion s that should not be taken lightly.

L. No. 115- 97, 131 Stat. 2054 (2017). Two years aft er the ACA' s passage, the Su- preme Court held that the individual mandate in Sec-tion 5000A(a) exceeded the scope of Congress 's commerce power. National Fed 'n of Indep. Bus. v. 313 Sebelius (NFIB ), 567 U.S. 519, 572 (2012) ( \"The Court today holds that our Consti tution protects us from fed- eral regulation under the Commerce Clause so long as we abstain from the regulated activity. \"). The Court nevertheless held that the provision \" may reasonably be characterized as a tax \" because, among other things, it \" yields the essential feature of any tax \" in that \"[i]t produces at least some revenue for the Gov- ernment. \" Id. at 564; see id. at 574. Chief Justice Rob- erts' controlling opinion made clear, however, that \"the statute reads more naturally as a command to buy insuranc e than as a tax, \" and that \" it is only be- cause [courts] have a duty to construe a statute to save it, if fairly possible, that [the provision] can be inter- preted as a tax \" given the revenue raised. Id. at 574; accord id. at 562- 63 (opinion of Roberts, C.J. ) (\"The most straightforward reading of the mandate is that it commands individuals to purchase insurance, \" but there is a savings construction under which it \" can be regarded as establishing a condition . . . that triggers a tax \" in light of \" the required payment to the IRS. \"). Critically, however, the Supreme Court 's saving construction of the individual mandate as a tax is no longer available. The TCJA eliminated the penalty for failing to purchase minimum essential coverage (starting in 2019), but left untouched the statutory \"[r]equirement to maintain minimum essential cover- age\" in Section 5000A(a). See Pub. L. No. 115 -97, \u00a7 11081, 131 Stat. at 2092. The individual mandate thus still exists, but it will no longer be fairly possible to describe it as a tax because it will no longer gener-ate any revenue. As of 2019, therefore, the individual mandate will be unconstitutional under controlling Supreme Court precedent holding that \" [t]he Federal Government 314 does not have the power to order people to buy healt h insurance. \" NFIB , 567 U.S. at 57475 (opinion of Rob- erts, C.J.); accord id. at 547561; id. at 64960 (opin- ion of Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Alito, JJ. ( \"joint dissent \")). Because the TCJA eliminated the basis for the Court 's saving construction in NFIB , the individ- ual mandate is untethered to any source of constitu- tional authority. Furthermore, as the United States explained to the Court in NFIB , Congress 's own \"find- ings establish that the guaranteed -issue and commu- nity-rating provisions are inseverable from the minimum coverage provision. \" Br. For Resp 't (Severa- bility) at 45, NFIB , No. 11 -393 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(I)). The remainder of the ACA, however, can stand despite the invalidation of those provisions. See id. at 26- 44. Although Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in part on the merits, they are not entitled to a preliminary in- junction. As Plaintiffs agree that the mandate will not become unconstitutional until the tax is eliminated in 2019, immediate relief is not warranted. That said, be- cause this is a pure question of law on w hich the Plain- tiffs and Defendants do not disagree, this Court should consider construing Plaintiffs ' motion as a request for summary judgment and then entering a declaratory judgment that the ACA 's provisions containing the in- dividual mandate as well as t he guaranteed -issue and community -rating requirements will all be invalid be- ginning on January 1, 2019. BACKGROUND A. The Affordable Care Act The ACA established a framework of economic reg- ulations and incentives concerning the health- insur- ance and healthc are industries. It spans more than 315 900 pages of the session laws and is divided into nine titles. Many of the ACA 's more familiar major provi- sions relating to the regulation of health insurance are in Titles I and II. There, among other things, Con-gress: Required certain individuals to maintain insur- ance. As detailed below, the ACA required most Americans to maintain health insurance meet- ing specified standards, subject to a monetary exaction for failure to do so. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A. Subjected certain employers to tax consequences concerning sponsorship of insurance. The ACA imposed tax liabilities under certain circum-stances on large employers that do not offer a minimum mandated level of coverage to full - time employees, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H \u2014a provi- sion sometimes referred to as the \"employer mandate \"\u2014and established tax incentives for eligible small businesses to purchase health in- surance for their employees, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 45R. Created health insurance exchanges. The ACA created health insurance \"exchanges\" where qualified health plans could be purchased by in- dividuals and small businesses. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18031- 18044. A State may choose whether or not to set up an exchange; if it elects not to, the federal government will establish one. Id . \u00a7 18041(b), (c). Imposed numerous insurance- market regula- tions . Two of the insurance market regulations prohibit insurers from either denying coverage because of an enrollee' s medical condition or history ( \"guaranteed issue \u00a7\u00a7 300gg 300gg -4(a), or charging higher premi- ums because of an applicant 's or enrollee' s med- ical condition or re- quirements, the ACA also: o Required insurers providing family coverage to continue covering adult children until age 26. Id. \u00a7 300gg -14(a). o Barred insurers from placing lifetime dollar caps on benefits. Id . \u00a7 300gg -11. o Prohibited insurers from canceling insur- absent fraud or intentional misrepre- sentation. Id. \u00a7 300gg -12. o Established medical loss ratios for insur- ers\u2014i.e. , minimum percentages of premium revenues that insurers must spend on clini- cal services and activities that improve health -care quality. See id . \u00a7 300gg -18(b). o Required plans to cover certain \" essential health benefits. \" Id. \u00a7 18022. Provided tax incentives to subsidize certain in- dividuals ' purchase of insurance. The ACA es- tablished a system of tax credits for eligible individuals ( i.e., those with income between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level) to purchase health insurance. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 36B. Expanded the scope of the Medicaid program . The newly eligible are primarily nonelderly adults without dependent children with income 317 below a certain threshold. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII).1 Perhaps foremost among the ACA 's provisions is the individual mandate to maintain insurance. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A. Subsection (a) of that provision im- poses a \" [r]equirement to maintain minimum essen- tial coverage \" stating that certain individuals \" shall . . . ensure \" that they are \"covered under minimum es- sential coverage. \" Id. \u00a7 5000A(a). Subsection (b) of that provision then imposes \"a penalty, \" called a \"shared responsibility payment, \" on certain taxpayers who \"fail[] to meet the requirement of subsection (a). \" Id. \u00a7 5000A(b). And subsection (c) provide s \"[t]he amount of the penalty imposed. \" Id. \u00a7 5000A(c). Notably, sub- section (d) provides that certain individuals \u2014i.e. , peo- ple with religious exemptions, individuals not lawfully present in the United States, and incarcerated indi- viduals \u2014are entirely exem pt from the requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage, id . \u00a7 5000A(d), whereas subsection (e) provides that certain other in- dividuals remain subject to that requirement but are exempt from the penalty for noncompliance, id. \u00a7 5000A(e) ( i.e., thos e who cannot afford coverage, tax- payers with income below the filing threshold, mem- bers of Indian tribes, those experiencing short coverage gaps, and individuals determined by the Sec- retary of Health and Human Services to have suffered 1 The ACA as originally enacted required States either to expand their Medicaid programs in this manner or lose all federal Medi- caid funding. The Supreme Court in NFIB invalidated the re- quirement and held that States may elect to decline this expansion without jeopardizing funding for their existing Medi-caid programs. 567 U.S. at 575- 88. 318 a hardship with resp ect to obtaining coverage). Fi- nally, subsection (f) defines \" minimum essential cov- erage \" to mean various types of insurance coverage, including government -sponsored programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, id . \u00a7 5000A(f)(1)(A), as well as eligible employer -sponsored plans and plans offered in the non -group market, id The ACA contains a specific finding by Congress that the \" individual responsibility requirement\" to maintain insurance is \" essential \" to \"creating effe ctive health insurance markets in which improved health insurance products that are guaranteed issue and do not exclude coverage of pre -existing conditions can be sold, \" because \"many individuals would wait to pur- chase health insurance until they needed ca re\" \"if there were no requirement. \" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(1), (2)(I). More generally, Congress found that \" [t]he re- 2 The definition of \"minimum essential coverage\" in Section 5000A(f) also serves a variety of other purposes throughout the Internal Revenue Code. For example, a large employer that fails to offer its employees minimum essential coverage is in certain circumstances subject to a tax. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H(a), (b). An in-dividual's eligibility for minimum essential coverage governs h is or her eligibility for a tax credit for the purchase of insurance. Id . \u00a7 36B(b)(3). A \"person who provides minimum essential coverage\" is required to make an informational return with the IRS. Id . \u00a7 6055. Large employers must also make a return describing whether they offer minimum essential coverage to their employ-ees. Id. \u00a7 6056. The taxability of certain health insurance reim- bursement arrangements for employees depends on the definition of minimum essential coverage. Id . \u00a7 106(g). An excise tax on hi gh-cost health coverage also turns on the concept of min- imum essential coverage, id . \u00a7 4980I, as does the deductibility of certain business expenses by health insurance providers, id. \u00a7 162(m)(6)(C) -(D). 319 quirement is an essential part \" of the ACA's \" regula- tion of the health insurance market. \" Id. \u00a7 see also id. \u00a7 18091(2)(C) -(G), (J) (iden- other ways in which the requirement furthered the ACA' s objectives). Beyond Titles I and II, the ACA addresses numer- ous other issues. For example: Title III amended Medicare. Among other pro- visions, it revised the Medicare Part D prescrip- tion drug program, \u00a7 3301; modified certain Medicare reimbursement rates for hospitals, \u00a7 3133; and required quality reporting for long - term care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals, and hospice programs, \u00a7 3004. Title IV funded existing prevention programs and created new prevention programs. For ex- ample, it created the National Prevention, Health Promotion and Public Health Council, \u00a7\u00a7 4001, 4002; required that chain restaurants disclose nutritional information, \u00a7 4205; and funded school -based heal th clinics, \u00a7 4101. Title V sought to expand the supply of health care workers, including through modifications to the federal student loan program, \u00a7 5201, and a variety of subject -specific grants. Title VI enacted anti -fraud requirements for fa- cilities p articipating in Medicare and Medicaid, including screening providers, \u00a7 6401, and pro-grams to reduce elder abuse. Title VII expanded the 340B drug discount pro-gram, \u00a7 7101, and established a process for FDA licensing of biosimilar products, \u00a7 7002. 320 Title V III established a voluntary long -term care insurance program, \u00a7 8002 (which has since been repealed, see Pub. L. No. 112- 240, \u00a7 642(a), 126 Stat. 2313, 2358 (2013)). Title IX addressed various taxes, including an excise tax on high -cost plans, \u00a7 9001, which has not yet taken effect due to postponements, see Pub. L. No. 114 -113, \u00a7 101(a), 129 115 -120, \u00a7 4002, 132 Stat. 28, 38 (2018). B. The Supreme Court 's Decision in NFIB v. Sebelius In the years immediately foll owing the ACA' s en- actment, a variety of challenges to its constitutionality were filed in federal court, many of which focused on whether Congress had the power under Article I of the Constitution to enact Section 5000A. That question was resolved by the S upreme Court in NFIB , a case brought by a small -business association and several individuals as well as 26 States, including 16 of the State Plaintiffs here. See 567 U.S. at 520. In NFIB , the Supreme Court held that although Section 5000A was not authorized by Congress 's com- merce power, it was a valid exercise of the taxing power. As Chief Justice Roberts explained in his con- trolling opinion, in light of the statutory language that individuals \"'shall '\" maintain coverage, the \" most straightforward reading o f the mandate is that it com- mands individuals to purchase insurance. \" 567 U.S. at 562 (quoting 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(a)). Furthermore, the Chief Justice agreed with the four dissenters that the \"Commerce Clause does not authorize such a com- mand, \" id. at 574; accord id. at 547- 561; id. at 649- 60 (joint dissent) \u2014a holding of the Court that was 321 acknowledged in the portion of the Chief Justice 's opinion that was joined by a majority of the Court. Id. at 572 ( \"The Court today holds that our Constitution protects us from federal regulation under the Com- merce Clause so long as we abstain from the regulated activity. \"). Nevertheless, because \" [u]nder the man- date, if an individual does not maintain health insur- ance, the only consequence is that he must make an additional payment to the IRS when he pays his taxes, \" Chief Justice Roberts agreed with the govern- ment that \" the mandate can be regarded as establish- ing a condition . . . that triggers a tax, \" given the obligation to adopt \" a saving construction \" \"if fairly possibl e.\" Id. at 562- 63 (citing 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(b)), 574- 75. A majority of the Court agreed that Section 5000A so construed could be upheld under Congress 's taxing power. Id. at 570. But critical to the Court' s saving construction and constitutional holding was the fact that the individual mandate 's shared respon- sibility payment \" yield[ed] the essential feature of any tax: [i]t produces at least some revenue for the Gov-ernment. \" Id. at 564. C. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act In the TCJA, Congress enacted a variety of amend- ments to the Internal Revenue Code. As relevant here, the Act amended Section 5000A(c) by reducing to $0 the monetary exaction imposed for noncompliance with the \" [r]equirement to maintain minimum essen- tial coverage \" for tax-years 2019 and beyond. Se e Pub. L. No. 115 -97, \u00a7 11081, 131 Stat. at 2092. Under the ACA, the tax penalty for failing to maintain minimum essential coverage for those years was to be the greater of 2.5% of household income or $695. The TCJA amended those figures to \" Zero percent \" and \"$0.\" Id. The TCJA leaves the rest of Section 5000A 322 intact, including the \"[r]equirement\" in subsection (a) that applicable individuals \" shall ... ensure \" they are covered by \" minimum essential coverage. \" Congress also left untouched the congressional fi ndings in Sec- tion 18091 that the \"individual responsibility require- ment\" to maintain insurance was \" essential \" to the guaranteed- issue and community -rating insurance re- forms. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(H )(I). D. This Case Plaintiffs are 20 States and two in dividuals. Inter- venors- Plaintiffs are two employers. Among other things, the individual plaintiffs have declared that the individual mandate legally obligates them to maintain minimum essential coverage, but that they wish in- stead to purchase non- ACA- compl iant insurance that better reflects their actuarial risks. See App'x in Sup- port of Application for Preliminary Injunction, Dkt. No. 41, at App.004 ( \"My preference would be to pur- chase reasonably -priced insurance coverage that is consumer- driven in accordan ce with my actuarial risk. \"); App.008 (\" The ACA prevents me from obtain- ing care from my preferred health care providers and has greatly increased my health insurance costs. I would purchase reasonably priced insurance coverage that allowed me to access car e locally from my pre- ferred service providers, were I not limited to the plans provided through the federal health insurance mar- ketplace.\" ). The complaint and the complaint -in-intervention raise five claims. Their central contention (Count 1) is that Secti on 5000A, as amended by the TCJA, falls outside of Congress 's Article I powers and is insevera- ble from the rest of the ACA, which they claim is thus invalid in its entirety. Am. Compl., Dkt. No. 27, \u00b6\u00b6 55 - 57; Complaint -in-Intervention, Dkt. No. 81 -1, \u00b6\u00b6 54 - 323 66. In Count 2, Plaintiffs claim that if Section 5000A is unconstitutional, then \" the rest of the ACA is irra- tional \" and thus violates due process. Am. Compl. \u00b6 65; Complaint -in-Intervention \u00b6\u00b6 71. In Count 3, they claim that if Section 5000A is unconsti tutional, then the rest of the ACA \"is outside the powers dele- gated to the United States by the Constitution \" and thus violates the Tenth Amendment. Am. Compl. \u00b6 73; Complaint -in-Intervention \u00b6 79. In Count 4, Plaintiffs assert that if the ACA is invalid in its entirety, then \"all regulations \" issued under its authority must be declared invalid. Am. Compl. \u00b6 81; Complaint -in-In- tervention \u00b6 87. injunctive relief. Am. Compl. \u00b6 85; Complaint -in-Intervention \u00b6 91. Because Plaintiffs ' preliminary injunction brief solely relies (pp. 21 -40) on their Count 1 claim that Section 5000A as amended by the TCJA is unconstitutional and inseverable from the rest of the ACA, that is the only claim to which Defendants respond here. LEGAL STANDARDS \"A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary rem- edy never awarded as of right. \" Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). A party seeking a preliminary injunction must show: \" (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not is- sued, (3) that the threatened injury if the injunction is denied outweighs any harm that will result if the in- junction is granted, and (4) that the grant of an injunc- tion will not disserve the public interest. \" Jordan v. Fisher, 823 F.3d 805, 809 (5th Cir. 2016). Due to its \"extraordinary \" nature, no preliminary injunction should be \" granted unless the party seeking it has 324 clearly carried the burden of persuasion on all four re- quirements. \" Id. at 221 (citation omitted). ARGUMENT The United States agrees with Plaintiffs that the ACA' s individual mandate, as amended by the TCJA, is unconstitutional. Because Section 5000A(a) can no longer fairly be described as a tax after the TCJA amendment takes effect in 2019, the saving construc- tion adopted by NFIB will no longer be available. In- stead, Section 5000A(a) must be interpreted per its plain text as a freestanding legal mandate to maintain insurance, which NFIB squarely held exceeds the powers of Congress. And as the United States ex- plained in NFIB , the individual mandate cannot be severed from the guaranteed -issue and community - rating provisions, though those three provisions can be severed from the rest of the ACA. Nonetheless, as explained below, preliminary injunctive relief should not be issued; instead, this Court should simply enter a declaratory judgment. I. THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS UN CON- STITUTIONAL AFTER THE TCJA. Starting in 2019, the TCJA will eliminate the indi- vidual mandate 's tax penalty under Section 5000A(b) - (c) but it will not alter the mandate 's plain -text \"[r]equirement to maintain minimum essential cover- age\" under Section 5000A(a). The individual mandate will continue to provide that applicable individuals \"shall . . . ensure \" that they are \" covered under mini- mum essential coverage. \" 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(a). Yet the only available interpretation of that plain text will be that it mean what it says: there is a legal mandate to obtain insurance; the mandate can no longer in- stead fairly be interpreted as a tax because it will raise 325 no revenue as Congress has eliminated the monetary penalty. This plain -text interpretation is confirmed by the Supreme Court 's decision in NFIB . The Chief Justice 's controlling opinion rep eatedly acknowledged \u2014and the four Justices in the joint dissent asserted even more emphatically \u2014that \"[t]he most straightforward reading of the mandate is that it commands individu- als to purchase insurance. After all, it states that in-dividuals 'shall ' maintain health insurance. \" NFIB , 567 U.S. at 562 (quoting \u00a7 5000A(a)); see also id. at 574 (\"the statute reads more naturally as a command to buy insurance than as a tax \"); id. at 662- 63 (joint dis- sent) (describing bly\" a \"mandate . . . enforced by a penalty \" rather than a tax). Although the Chief Justice concluded at the time that it was \"fairly possible \" to interpret the man- date as merely \" establishing a condition \u2014not owning health insurance \u2014that triggers a tax \u2014the required payment to the IRS, \" id. at 563, that saving construc- tion is no longer available because, post -TCJA, the mandate no longer \" yields the essential feature of any tax,\" which is that it must \" produce[] at least some rev- enue for the Government. \" Id. at 564 (opi nion of the Court); see also id. at 574 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.) (\"Congress' s authority under the taxing power is lim- ited to requiring an individual to pay money into the Federal Treasury, no more. \"). This plain -text interpretation is further confirmed by established canons of construction. First , it is \" a cardinal principle \" that a statute should be construed so that \" no clause, sentence, or word shall be superflu- ous, void, or insignificant. \" TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 (2001). Here, in light of the elimination of the Section 5000A(b) penalty, Section 5000A(a) would 326 be utterly meaningless unless it imposes a legal re- quirement that covered individuals shall maintain in- surance, as would Section 5000A(d) 's exemption from that requirement. See 26 U.S .C. \u00a7\u00ba5000A(d) (setting forth certain categories of individuals who are not sub- ject to Section 5000A(a) 's \"[r]equirement to maintain minimum essential coverage \"). Second , \"Congress is presumed to act with full awareness of existing judi-cial interpretations .\" United States v. Fausto , 484 U.S. 439, 460 n.6 (1987) (citing Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U.S. 522, 525 (1987) (per curiam)). Here, Congress was indisputably aware of NFIB 's saving construction of Section 5000A(a) 's individual mandate, and that it rested on the revenue raised by Section 5000A(b) 's penalty. Yet Congress eliminated the linchpin of that saving construction \u2014the revenue- raising penalty \u2014 without altering the unambiguous language of the mandate itself. Cf. Harris v. United States , 536 U.S. 545, 556 (2002) (refusing to apply the canon of consti- tutional avoidance where doing so would contradict the \"respect for Congress \" upon which \" [t]he avoidance canon rests \"). This plain -text interpretation is also shared by at least some members of the publ ic. See App'x in Sup- port of Application for Preliminary Injunction at App.004 ( \"I value compliance with my legal obliga- tions, and believe that following the law is the right thing to do. The repeal of the associated health insur- ance tax penalty did not relieve me of the requirement to purchase health insurance. I continue to maintain minimum essential health insurance coverage be- cause I am obligated to comply with the Affordable Care Act 's individual mandate, even though doing so is a burden to me. \"); App.0 08 (same). 327 In sum, once the associated financial penalty is gone, the \" tax\" saving construction will no longer be fairly possible and thus the individual mandate will be unconstitutional. As a majority of the Supreme Court held in NFIB , \"[t]he Federal Government does not have the power to order people to buy health insur- ance. Section 5000A would therefore be unconstitu-tional if read as a command. \" NFIB , 567 U.S. at 575 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.); see also id. at 706 07 (joint dissent); id. at 572 (opinion of the Court). Because Sec- tion 5000A(a) must be read as a command once the TCJA 's elimination of the penalty takes effect in 2019, it will exceed Congress 's enumerated powers. II. THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS NOT SEV- ERABLE FROM THE GUARANTEED -ISSUE AND COMMUNITY -RATING PROVISIONS, BUT THOSE THREE PROVISIONS ARE SEVERABLE FROM THE REST OF THE ACA. In addition to claiming that the individual man- date is unconstitutional in light of the TCJA, Plaintiffs claim that the rest of the ACA is not severable from the unconstitutional mandate. A plaintiff seeking to invalidate provisions of a statute as inseverable must show that it is \"evident that Congress would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of those which are not. \" Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1482 (2018); see also Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock , 480 U.S. 678, 684- 85 (1987). This inquiry reflects the fact that under our Constitu- tion, the Judiciary \" cannot rewrite a statute and give it an effect altogether different from that sought by the measure viewed as a whole. \" Murphy , 138 S. Ct. at 1482 (quoting R.R. Retirement Bd. v. Alton R. Co. , 295 U.S. 330, 362 (1935)). Although the Supreme Court 's 328 test for severability is \" essentially an inquiry into leg- islative intent, \" Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chip- pewa Indians , 526 U.S. 172, 191 (1999), \"the enacted text is the best indicator of intent, \" Nixon v. United States , 506 U.S. 224, 232 ( 1993).3 Here, as the United States has consistently main- tained, the individual mandate is not severable from the ACA' s guaranteed -issue and community -rating re- quirements, but it is severable from the ACA 's other provisions. 3 In addition, plaintiffs may only seek to invalida te statutory pro- visions as inseverable if those provisions themselves injure them. The Supreme Court has held that it \"ha[s] no business answer- ing\" questions about the inseverability of provisions that concern only \"the rights and obligations of parties not before the court.\" Printz v. United States , 521 U.S. 898, 935 (1997); see also Mur- phy, 138 S. Ct. at 1485- 87 (Thomas, J. concurring). And that holding is consistent with basic limitations on Article III stand- ing and equitable remedies. See, e.g. , Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc. , demonstrate standing . . . . for each form of relief that is sought.\" (citations omitted)); Mad- sen v. Women's Health Ctr., Inc., 51 2 U.S. 753, 765 (1994) (ex- plaining that equitable relief must \"be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs\" (citation omitted)). Here, the individual plaintiffs have adequately alleged injury from the ACA's guaranteed -issue and community -rating provisions. See, e.g., App'x in Support of Appli- cation for Preliminary Injunction at App.004 (\"My preference would be to purchase reasonably -priced insurance coverage that is consumer -driven in accordance with my actuarial risk.\"). By contrast, Plaintiffs have not argued and cannot argue that each and every other provision in the ACA also injures them. Accord-ingly, regardless of whether other provisions of the ACA are in- severable and whether this Court may consider that question in analyzing the inseverability of the guaranteed -issue and commu- nity-rating provisions, it would be improper for this Court to en- ter judgment on the inseverability of any of the many ACA provisions that do not injure Plaintiffs. 329 A. The Guaranteed -Issue and Community - Rating Requirements Are Not Severable The United States contended in NFIB that \"Con- gress 's findings establish that the guaranteed- issue and community -rating provisions are inseverable from the minimum coverage provision.\" Br. for Resp. (Sev- erability) at 45, NFIB , No. 11 -393. And the Supreme Court has since essentially agreed, noting that these \"three reforms are closely intertwined \" and that \"Con- gress found that the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements would not work without the cov- erage requirement. \" King v. Burwell , 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2487 (2015). That finding, set forth at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(I), specifically and expressly explains why Congress be- lieved that the individual mandate requirement is \" es- sential \" to the operation of the guaranteed- issue and community -rating provisions. Namely, \" if there were no requirement, many individuals would wait to pur- chase health insurance until they needed care. \" Id. But \"[b]y significantly increasing health insurance coverage,\" the mandate, \" together with the other pro- visions of this Act, will minimize t his adverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health insurance premiums. \" Id. Accordingly, the individual mandate \"is essential to creating effective health insurance markets in which impr oved health insurance products that are guaranteed issue and do not exclude coverage of pre -existing conditions can be sold. \" Id. In short, Congress found that enforcing guaranteed issue and community -rating requirements without an individ- ual mandate would allow individuals to game the sys- tem by waiting until they were sick to purchase health insurance, thereby increasing the price of insurance 330 for everyone else\u2014the polar opposite of what Congress sought in enacting the ACA. Indeed, Congress 's conclusions r egarding the link- age between the individual mandate, guaranteed- is- sue, and community -rating requirements were agreed upon by all of the Justices in NFIB . See 567 U.S. at 548 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.) ( \"The guaranteed -issue and community -rating reforms ... exacerbate \" the \"problem\" of \" healthy individuals who choose not to purchase insurance to cover potential health care needs,\" and \"threaten to impose massive new costs on insurers[.] ... The individual mandate was Congress 's solution to these problems. \"); id. at 597- 98 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ( \"[T]hese two provisions, Congress comprehended, could not work effectively unless individuals were given a pow-erful incentive to obtain insurance. ... [G]uaranteed - issue and community -rating laws alone will not work. \"); id. at 695- 96 (joint dissent) ( \"Insurance com- panies bear new costs imposed by a collection of insur- ance regulations and taxes, including 'guaranteed issue ' and 'community rating ' requirements . . . but the insurers benefit f rom the new, healthy purchasers who are forced by the Individual Mandate to buy the insurers ' product. \"). In expressly finding this link between these three provisions, Congress looked to experiences from prior state experiments in restructuring their laws govern- ing health insurance. In some States, insurers were forced to cover everyone and charge the same rates re- gardless of health status, and chose to raise premiums for healthy individuals. See Br. of America 's Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross B lue Shield Asso- ciation as Amici Curiae in Support of Reversal of the Court of Appeals ' Severability Judgment at 8 11, 331 NFIB , No. 11 -393. For example, after imposing guar- anteed- issue and community -rating requirements without an individual mandate, New Hampshire ex- perienced an increase in premiums and, ultimately, all but two insurers withdrew from the State. See Br. fo r Resp 't (Severability) at 49, NFIB , No. 11 -393; see also id. at 4851 (collecting examples). Thus, Congress acted on the assumption that severing the individual mandate from the guaranteed -issue and community - rating provisions \" necessarily would impose si gnifi- cant risks and real uncertainties on insurance compa-nies, their customers, all other major actors in the system, and the government treasury. \" NFIB , 567 U.S. at 699 (joint dissent). Although the empirical as- sumptions underlying this connection may be subject to dispute ( see, e.g. , Br. for Court -Appointed Amicus Curiae Supporting Complete Severability at 35 41, NFIB , No. 11 -393), what is indisputable is that Con- gress believed that these three provisions were inter- dependent in enacting the ACA. That conclusion is not affected by the fact that the TCJA eliminated the mandate 's penalty. It still re- mains the cas e that, in the complete absence of the mandate, retention of the guaranteed -issue and com- munity -rating requirements would expose health in- surers (and their customers) to unfettered adverse selection by individuals who can game the system by waiting until t hey are sick to purchase insurance, con- trary to Congress 's express intent. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(I). Nor is this conclusion undermined by the fact that the TCJA did not itself eliminate the guaranteed- issue and community -rating require - ments at the same time it eliminated the mandate 's penalty and thereby rendered the mandate unconsti- tutional. The best evidence of Congress 's intent is 332 found in the legislative findings, which continue to re- main part of the ACA after the TCJA. These express findings continue to describe the mandate as \" essen- tial\" to the operation of the guaranteed -issue and com- munity -rating provisions. See EEOC v. Hernando Bank, Inc. , 724 F.2d 1188, 1190- 91 (5th Cir. 1984) (noting that in determining \" whether Congress would have enacted the remainder of the statute in the ab- sence of the invalid provision[,] ... [c]ongressional in- tent and purpose are best determined by an analysis of the language of the statute in question \"). Those find- ings cannot be deemed to have been impliedly re- pealed by Congr ess's mere elimination of the financial penalty. See Nat 'l Ass' n of Home Builders v. Defs. of Wildlife , 551 U.S. 644, 662 (2007) (explaining that \"' re- peals by implication are not favored ' and will not be presumed unless the 'intention of the legislature to re- peal is clear and manifest '\" (citation omitted)).4 B. The ACA 's Other Provisions Are Severable As the United States also contended in NFIB , the remainder of the ACA is severable from the individual mandate and the guaranteed -issue and community - rating requ irements. Br. For Resp 't (Severability) at 4454, NFIB , No. 11 -393. 1. The ACA' s other major provisions \u2014concern- ing various insurance regulations, health insurance 4 That is especially true given that Congress passed the TCJA by a majority vote under the restrictive reconciliation process, which limits congressional action to generally fiscal matters. See H.R.1, 115th Cong., \"An Act to pro- vide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolu-tion on the budget for fiscal year 2018\"; Cong. Research Serv., Bill Heniff Jr., The Budget The Senate's \"Byrd Rule\" (Nov. 22, 2016), https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30862.pdf (last visited June 7, 2018). Although Congress was able to revoke the tax penalty, it could not have revoked the guaranteed -issue or community -rating provisions through reconciliation. 333 exchanges and associated subsidies, the employer mandate and Medicaid expansion, and reduced fed- eral healthcare reimbursement rates for ho spitals \u2014 are severable from the individual mandate. Although Congress made clear its belief that the mandate is not severable from the guaranteed- issue and community - rating requirements, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(I), Con- gress did not do so with respect to th e ACA' s other ma- jor provisions. The ACA contains numerous mechanisms designed to expand health insurance coverage through federal regulation. Each of these provisions can inde- pendently operate \" consistent with Congress' basic ob- jectives in enacting the sta tute, \" and therefore, this Court \"must retain \" them. United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 25859 (2005). Although Plaintiffs spec-ulate (Br. at 3539) as to a chain reaction of failed pol- icymaking that could occur once the individual mandate is struck do wn, they cannot show that strik- ing down the individual mandate, guaranteed -issue, and community -rating requirements means that the ACA necessarily \" ceases to implement any coherent federal policy. \" Murphy , 138 S. Ct. at 1483. Congress 's other legislative f indings in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2) demonstrate that, instead, these other provisions are severable from the mandate. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(C), (E), (F) (finding that the \" individual re- sponsibility requirement,\" \" together with the other provisions of this Act, \" will accomplish Congress 's ob- jectives of \" increas[ing] the number and share of Americans who are insured \" and \"significantly reduc- ing the number of the uninsured \"). The other major provisions still serve the objectives that Congress had when enacting the ACA notwithstanding the elimina- tion of the mandate (plus guaranteed- issue and com- munity -rating) \u2014especially given that Congress itself 334 reduced the effect of the mandate by eliminating its penalty in the TCJA, and yet did not repeal the rest of the ACA despite repeated attempts to do so. For example, Congress has repeatedly expanded the scope of Medicaid since the inception of the pro- gram over half a century ago. There is no reason why the ACA' s particular expansion of Medicaid hinges on the individual m andate. The same can be said about the health insurance exchanges, which likewise can operate as functioning \" marketplace[s] for the pur- chase of health insurance \" without the individual mandate. H.R. Rep. No. 443, 111th Cong., 2d Sess. Pt. 2, at 976 also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(J) ( \"By significantly increasing health in- surance coverage and the size of purchasing pools, which will increase economies of scale, the require- ment, together with the other provisions of this Act, will significantly reduce administrative costs and lower health insurance premiums. \"). This is not a case like Murphy in which the Court concluded that finding one provision severable from another would inher- ently bring about \" a weird result. \" 138 S. Ct. at 1483- 84 (\"If the people of a State support the legalization of [an activity], federal law would make the activity ille- gal.\"). Instead, Plaintiffs rely on a chain of speculative hypotheticals, which are not strong enough to justify invalidating these other part s of the ACA 's insurance market regulations. Congress has provided further proof of its intent that the bulk of the ACA would remain in place by amending the ACA on numerous occasions after the TCJA invalidated the individual mandate. See Pub. L. No. 115 -120, \u00a7 3002(g)(2), 132 Stat. at 35 (amending 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(f)(1) (revising definition of \"mini- mum essential coverage, \" which is relevant to various 335 insurance reforms besides the mandate, see supra at 7-8 n.2)); id. \u00a7 4002, 132 Stat. at 38 (amending ACA \u00a7 9001(c) (delaying implementation date of excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored health coverage)); id. \u00a7 4003 (amending ACA \u00a7 9010(j) (suspending annual fee on health insurance providers)); see also Pub. L. No. 88, 300- 01, 308- 131 Stat. 2044, 2048- 49 (2017). Congress likely would not have sought to amend a statute that it believed had been invalidated in total. 2. If the ACA' s major provisions besides guaran- teed- issue and community -rating are severable from the mandate, then it follows that the remaining provi- sions are as well. But even if some or all of the other major provisions were inseverable, this Court still should not hold \"inseverable all other minor provisions scattered throughout the ACA. \" Pltfs. Br. 39. Many, if not all, of these \" minor \" provisions serve purposes far removed from the individual mandate, the guaran- teed- issue and community -rating requireme nts, and the purchase of health insurance in general, as Plain- tiffs appear to acknowledge. Cf. id. at 40 (arguing that the \"minor provisions \" \"only (if at all) tangentially fur- ther the law 's main purpose of near -universal afforda- ble care \"). Thus, the prese nce or absence of three provisions of the ACA would not affect the functioning of, for example, \" regulations on the display of nutri- tional content at restaurants. \" Id. at 40 (citing 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(q)(5)(H)). The cases that Plaintiffs cite, moreover, confi rm that the tangential nature of these \" minor \" provisions weighs in favor of their severability. For example, in Williams v. Standard Oil Co. of Louisiana , 278 U.S. 336 235 (1929), after holding a law fixing gasoline prices unconstitutional, the Supreme Court concluded that several other provisions (including a provision requir-ing permits to sell gasoline and providing for the issu- ing of the permits) were inseverable because they were \"adjuncts \" with the sole purpose of enabling the prob- lematic price -fixing pro vision. Id. at 242- 43. Here, in contrast, the \"minor \" provisions are not \"adjuncts \" with the sole purpose of effectuating Section 5000A \u2014 rather, they operate in a completely different sphere. Plaintiffs also suggest (Br. at 40) that the \" minor \" provisions w ould not have garnered the requisite votes in Congress if they were not attached to the rest of the ACA. But the severability analysis should be one of statutory construction, not parliamentary proba bili- ties. A court should not hypothesize about the motiva-tions of individual legislators, or sp eculate about the number of votes available for any number of alterna- tives. To the contrary, in New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992), the Supreme Court recognized that the statute before it, \"like much federa l legisla- tion, embodies a compromise among the States, \" but nonetheless held that the invalidated provision of the statute was severable from other provisions. See id. at 183, 186 -87. Accordingly, this Court should hold that the indi- vidual mandate is sever able from all but the ACA' s guaranteed- issue and community -rating require- ments. 337 III. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS NOT WARRANTED AT THIS TIME, BUT A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. Although Plaintiffs have demonstrated a substan- tial likelihoo d of success on the merits, at least in part, preliminary relief is nevertheless unwarranted here. The individual mandate will not become unconstitu- tional under NFIB until the TCJA 's elimination of the mandate 's tax penalty goes into effect in 2019. An in- junction may \" be issued only if future injury is ' cer- tainly impending. '\" Aransas Project v. Shaw , 775 F.3d 641, 664 (5th Cir. 2014) (quoting Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat 'l Union , 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979)). Here, the injury imposed by the individual ma ndate is not sufficiently imminent to warrant preliminary in-junctive relief, especially where final adjudication would be possible before that injury occurs. Because Plaintiffs agree that the mandate will not become unconstitutional until the tax is elimin ated in 2019, immediate relief is not warranted at this time. That said, because this is a pure question of law on which the Plaintiffs and Defendants do not disagree, this Court should consider construing Plaintiffs ' mo- tion as a request for summary judgme nt and then en- tering a declaratory judgment that the ACA 's provisions establishing the individual mandate as well as the guaranteed -issue and community -rating re- quirements will all be invalid as of January 1, 2019. That would be adequate relief against the govern- ment. See, e.g. , Fla. ex rel. Bondi v. U.S. Dep 't of Health & Human Servs. , 780 F. Supp. 2d 1256, 1305 (N.D. Fla. 2011). 338 CONCLUSION For these reasons, this Court should hold that the ACA' s individual mandate will be unconstitutional as of January 1, 2019, and that the ACA 's guaranteed - issue and community -rating provisions are insevera- ble from the mandate.

UNITED STATES O F AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET Defendants _______ BLAKE FULENWIDER _______ My name is Blake Fulenwider and I am over the age of 18 and fully competent to make this declaration an d state the following: 1. I am Deputy Commissioner and Chief of the Division of Medical Assistance Plans for the Georgia Department of Community Health (DCH). DCH 's Di- vision of Medical Assistance Plans administers Geor-gia Medicaid and the Children 's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), known as PeachCare for Kids\u00ae. 2. Georgia Medicaid serves: (1) Low -income fam- ilies; (2) Children; (3) Pregnant women; (4) Aged resi-dents; (5) Blind persons; and (5) individuals with disabilities. PeachCare for Kids\u00ae serves children and youth from birth to age 19 who are members of a household with income above Georgia Medicaid in- come eligibility criteria up to 252% of the Federal Pov- erty Level (FPL). As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), an additional category of people eligible for 340 Georgia Medicaid as added to this list: individuals un- der age 26 who aged out of foster care in the state and who were enrolled in Medicaid while in foster care. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(IX); Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. 111- 148, 124 Stat. 865, \u00a7 2004. 3. Financial eligibility for Medicaid, CHIP, and many other social programs is based on a household 's income level as compared to the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). The FPL is intended to identify the minimum amount of income a household would need to meet very basic needs and is established annually by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 4. Both the state and federal governments fund Medicaid. The federal share of Medicaid funds Georgia receives is based on the Federal Medical As sistance Percentage (FMAP). The FMAP is calculated annually using each state 's per capita personal income in rela- tion to the U.S. average. Currently (FFY 2018), Geor-gia receives FMAP of 68.50%, meaning the federal/state share of Medicaid funding is around 70/30 for medical benefit expenditures. Generally, ad- ministrative expenses are matched 50/50 between the state and federal government. 5. DCH uses several factors to determine eligibil- ity for Medicaid including: (1) Household income; (2) age; (3) assets; a nd (4) other factors including but not limited to eligibility for other non -DCH administered benefits such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). 6. Household income often varies over time and is a key fact or for Medicaid eligibility. Before the ACA was passed, DCH would review eligibility criteria for Medicaid enrollees every 6 months to allow for timely 341 disenrollment when a person no longer qualified for Medicaid. 7. The ACA imposed changes to the Medicaid el- igibility renewal process. Pursuant to the ACA, eligi-bility redeterminations are now allowed no more frequently than once per 12 months 1, unless the enrol- lee volunteers to DCH that his or her household in- come has changed in a way that makes the benefici ary ineligible. This change mandated by the ACA re-strains the frequency with which DCH can identify persons no longer eligible for Medicaid and remove them from the program, thus increasing the number of persons eligible for Medicaid services at any given time. This restriction has caused some ineligible en- rollees to receive benefits for a period of time that ex- ceeds their period of eligibility, despite DCH 's desire to remove enrollees from the program promptly upon becoming ineligible for continued enrollm ent. 8. The ACA also required states to adopt a new measure of household income, Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) of a Non -Elderly, Non -Disabled household, for the purpose of determining eligibility for state Medicaid and CHIP programs. Adoption of MAGI standards required Georgia to marginally 2 in- crease income thresholds for affected categories of eli- gibility when Georgia 's MAGI Conversion Plan was approved by the federal government in 2014. 9. The ACA' s individual mandate contributed to the expansion of the Medicaid population in Georgia as well. As a result of the individual mandate, Georgia 1 42 CFR Sec. 435.916(a). 2 https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program -information/ medicai d-and -chip-and-the-marketplace/downloads/ga-con- verted-thresholds-03jul2013.pdf (MAGI conversion results). 342 residents were necessarily required to secure health care coverage or pay a fine to the federal government. Even individuals who qualified for the federal \" Hard- ship Exemption \" sought qualified coverage through available sources, including Medicaid. Efforts to avoid imposition of the fine likely prompted more individu- als to secure Medicaid from DCH. 10. Although it is difficult to quantify the exact number of Medica id enrollees that can be attributed to the individual mandate, I believe that the individual mandate played a substantial role in the increase in the number of Medicaid recipients since 2011. This as- sertion is based on my experience with DCH and the Governor' s Office of Planning and Budget (OPB), as well as research I have participated in to prepare pol-icy analyses and budget projections since the ACA was enacted into law. 11. The ACA requires Georgia 's Integrated Eligi- bility System (IES), known as \"Georgia Gateway,\" to electronically interface with the Federally Facilitated Exchange (FFE) systems in order to receive Medicaid applications that the FFE has assessed as Medicaid - eligible. It is the obligation of DCH, as the Single State Agency for Medicaid, to conduct a full eligibility deter- mination based upon information received by the FFE. 12. Georgia has not expanded Medicaid to cover childless adults from 0% FPL up to 138% FPL. How-ever, the FFE has and continues to assess individuals who fall within the ab ove range as eligible for Medi- caid and transmits this assessment to DCH for an eli-gibility determination. DCH continues to receive thousands of such applications from the FFE each year, creating a significantly increased workload on Medicaid eligibility st aff whose resources are limited. 343 13. The ACA also mandates the specific Medicaid services Georgia is required to cover. Rather than al- lowing DCH to make such determinations based on the needs of Georgia 's population, the ACA imposed a \"one- size-fits-all\" rule upon Georgia, thereby govern- ing the provision of inpatient hospital services, outpa-tient hospital services, family planning services and supplies, federally qualified health centers, nurse midwife services, certified pediatric and family nurse practiti oner services, home health care services, med- ical transportation services, nursing facility services for individuals 21 or over, rural health clinic services, and other significant and complex medical services and systems. 14. From January 2014 \u2014 March 201 8, Georgia 's Medicaid enrollment has grown from 1.829 million to 2.074 million individuals. 15. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and cor-rect. Respectfully submitted this the 14 th day of May, 2018. /s/ Blake T. Fulenwider Blake T.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET Defendants _______ TERESA MACCARTNEY _______ My name is Teresa MacCartney and I am over the age of 18 and fully competent to make this declaration and state the following: 1. I am the Chief Financ ial Officer of the State of Georgia and the Director of the Governor 's Office of Planning and Budget ( \"OPB \"). I have served as the state 's CFO and the Director of OPB for five and a half years. As the CFO of the State of Georgia and the Di-rector of OPB, I am responsible for overseeing the fis- cal affairs of the state and developing financial policies and plans for each of its public departments, agencies, and institutions. As a part of these responsibilities, I monitor agency expenditures and develop budget rec- ommendations to suit the state 's policy goals. I am particularly familiar with changes in costs, plans, and policies related to the enactment of the Affordable Care Act ( \"ACA\" ) because I oversee the budgets for the Georgia Department of Community Health (\"DCH \"), the University System of Georgia Board of Regents 345 (\"BOR\" ) and the State Accounting Office ( \"SAO \"). I have personal knowledge of the matters and infor- mation set forth herein. 2. DCH administers the state Medicaid and PeachCare for Kids programs an d the State Health Benefit Plan ( \"SHBP \"). PeachCare for Kids is a com- prehensive health care program for uninsured chil- dren living in Georgia. SHBP provides health insurance coverage to state employees, retirees, and their dependents. 3. BOR administers the University System of Georgia Healthcare Plan which provides health insur-ance coverage to University System of Georgia em-ployees, retirees, and their dependents. 4. SAO is responsible for facilitating the comple- tion of federal reports to the Internal Reven ue Service and insured employees and retirees. Provider Costs Associated with ACA Regulations 5. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act, DCH and BOR have suffered and continue to suffer financial burdens because the ACA replaced the flexi-bility they previously had to provide health insurance plans tailored to needs of Georgia 's population with federal policies. Across all programs and agencies, compliance with the ACA has cost the State of Georgia an estimated net cumulative $514 million after dis- counting offsets from increased employer premiums and federal funding. Moreover, because most of the relevant ACA mandates are permanent, the State of Georgia will continue to pay additional costs indefi-nitely. 6. Prior to the implementation of the ACA, DCH provided coverage for unmarried dependents up to age 346 25 who are enrolled as a full -time student at least five months during the year or are eligible to enroll but are prevented due to illness or injury to remain on their parents ' insurance OR requires that a health services plan or health insurer exempt dependent children in- capable of self -sustaining employment due to disabil- ity from dependent age limits. But the ACA requires health insurance coverage to provide continuing cov- erage for all dependents until the age of 26. Continu- ing health insurance coverage for adult dependents until the age of 26 imposes significant costs upon DCH because each individual insured by a DCH plan con- stitutes expenses for the system. Had DCH been per-mitted to continue providing d ependent coverage that met pre -ACA requirements, these costs would not have been imposed upon DCH. Compliance with the ACA will require DCH to indefinitely continue paying these additional costs because the dependent age re- quirement mandated by the ACA remains 26. 7. Prior to adoption of the ACA, DCH required insured persons to pay coinsurance and/or co- pays for preventative care that are now disallowed because the ACA requires that preventative care be covered at 100%. Covering 100% of preventative care co sts more than covering less than 100% of preventative care. Thus, if DCH could have continued to provide its prior coverage plan for preventative care, it would have saved substantial sums. Compliance with the ACA will require DCH to indefinitely continue paying these additional costs. 8. Prior to implementation of the ACA, DCH pro- vided insurance coverage for contraceptive drugs at a rate below 100%. The ACA, however, requires contra- ceptives to be covered at 100%. Covering drugs at 100% of cost is more expensive for DCH than covering 347 drugs at less than 100%. If DCH could have main- tained its prior coverage plan for contraceptives, therefore, it would have saved significant monies. Compliance with the ACA will require DCH to indefi-nitely continue paying these additional costs. 9. The ACA requires DCH to pay a Patient -Cen- tered Outcomes Research Institute ( \"PCORI \") fee. The fee increases yearly. If the PCORI fee had not been re- quired under the ACA, DCH would not have paid it and would therefore have not seen an i ncrease in cost. This fee is imposed currently for plans that end before October 1, 2019, and therefore, will continue to be paid into 2020 under the ACA. 10. The ACA required DCH to pay a Transitional Reinsurance Program fee. If this requirement had not been in place, DCH would not have paid the fee and would have saved substantial sums. 11. The ACA requires limits for consumer spend- ing on in- network essential health benefits ( \"EHB\" s) covered under most health plans. Once a person has reached the limit, th e plan must cover 100% of all medical expenses. Prior to the ACA, DCH had no such limit. Covering 100% of medical expenses cost more than covering less than 100% of medical expenses. Thus, the imposition of this regulation has required DCH to spend signifi cant funds. This is a permanent requirement under the ACA, thus the costs to DCH as a result will continue indefinitely. 12. After the implementation of the ACA 's individ- ual mandate, DCH experienced a substantial increase in employee elections to obtain health insurance. Be-cause SHBP incurs additional costs for each additional employee who elects to obtain health insurance, the 348 increased number of elections resulted in substantial costs to SHBP. 13. The aforementioned ACA provisions also im- pact the Universi ty System of Georgia Healthcare plan. Like SHBP, BOR was and continues to be im- pacted by ACA mandates that differ from its pre -ACA policies. Such ACA mandates include eliminating life- time maximums, changing coverage requirements for preventative care and out -of-pocket maximums, and instituting reoccurring fees. All of these provisions as well as increased health benefit elections have in- creased BOR 's health plan costs. 14. As a result of the ACA, DCH and BOR in- creased employee premiums and participated in t he Early Retiree Reinsurance Program established by the ACA to offset the cost of the law 's mandates and fees. Employee premiums are paid by state employees. Thus, although DCH 's costs were offset by raising em- ployee premiums, state employee wages were neg a- tively affected. Furthermore, when these revenue adjustments are taken into account, the net cost of the ACA to SHBP and BOR are still an estimated $442.1 million and $44.1 million, respectively, and those amounts will continue to increase each year due to the permanent and otherwise continuing mandates of the ACA. Medicaid Costs Associated with ACA Regulations 15. With the passing of the ACA, DCH has been financially harmed and will continue to be financially harmed by the burdens imposed on it related to Medi-caid and CHIP programs. To date, Medicaid and CHIP program changes as a result of the ACA have cost DCH an estimated net $24.3 million after discounting 349 increased rebates for CMO coverage and an increased Enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percenta ge. These costs will continue year after year because the relevant ACA provisions are permanent. 16. Prior to the ACA, Georgia assessed the eligi- bility of Medicaid recipients every six months. To com-ply with the ACA, Georgia now reviews the eligibility of Medicaid recipients no more frequently than every 12 months. Less -frequent eligibility assessments re- sult in a greater number of Medicaid recipients. Each additional Medicaid recipient represents additional costs to DCH. Thus, were it not for the implementation of this regulation, DCH would have saved substantial costs. This is a permanent requirement under the ACA, so the costs to DCH as a result will continue in- definitely. 17. The ACA imposes a fee on all for -profit entities involved in the business of pr oviding health insurance. This fee applies to Care Management Organizations (CMOs) providing health insurance coverage to Medi- caid beneficiaries. DCH is required to reimburse CMOs for the cost of the fee. If DCH was not required to pay the fee, DCH would h ave saved substantial sums. Compliance with the ACA will require DCH to indefinitely continue paying these growing costs. 18. The ACA allowed hospitals to determine pre- sumptive eligibility for increased populations to in-clude low income Medicaid categories of eligibility. It also prevents entities conducting presumptive eligibil- ity determination from requiring proof of status. Once a qualifying hospital determines a person is presump-tively eligible for Medicaid, the person can receive ser- vices for a period of 60 days. Even if the person is later found to be ineligible for Medicaid, Medicaid must pay for services rendered during the period of presumptive 350 eligibility. This provision of the ACA has imposed sub- stantial costs on DCH through Medicaid match re- quire ments. This is a permanent provision of the ACA, thus the costs to DCH as a result will continue indefi- nitely. 19. The ACA required the state Medicaid program to increase primary care provider (PCP) reimburse-ment rates to 100% of Medicare reimbursement rat es between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2014. This provision required CMOs to adjust capitation rates to account for higher reimbursement rates for primary care providers, which resulted in an increase in the Health Insurance Provider Fees paid by the CMOs and was then passed onto the state through CMO cap- itation rates. 20. The net cost of the ACA to DCH 's Medicaid programs is estimated to be $24.3 million when the costs of eligibility review requirements, presumptive eligibility requirements, Health In surer Provider Fee, and expansion of State Children 's Insurance Plan (CHIP) coverage are offset by savings from the ACA 's policy of increasing rebates for CMO coverage and its 23% increase to the Enhanced Federal Medical Assis- tance Percentage for CHIP beneficiaries. Administrative Costs Associated with ACA Regulations 21. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act, SAO, DCH, and BOR have had to comply with report- ing requirements that would not have otherwise been required. The cost to these agencies of c ompliance with the ACA' s reporting requirements is an estimated net $3.6 million to date after discounting the new En-hanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage. Since 351 reporting requirements are a permanent provision of the ACA, reporting costs will conti nue indefinitely. 22. Under the ACA, SAO is required to report cov- erage annually. This is a permanent provision of the ACA, thus the costs to SAO as a result will continue indefinitely. 23. Under the ACA, DCH is required to provide Medicaid and PeachCare b eneficiaries with coverage information on IRS 1095 -B forms. This is a permanent provision of the ACA, thus the costs to DCH as a result will continue indefinitely. 24. After the implementation of the ACA, DCH ex- perienced increased enrollment of individuals already eligible for Medicaid benefits under pre -ACA eligibil- ity standards. The enrollment increase required DCH to enhance its Medicaid Management Information System to process additional Medicaid applications. Enhancing its Medicaid Management Informati on System was very costly. 25. The total administrative costs associated with the ACA are estimated to total $11.2 million. These costs were partially offset by the ACA 's increasing the Enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage from 77% to 100% which reduced administrative ex- penditures by an estimated $7.7 million. The net cost increase for administrative programs is estimated to be $3.6 million. 26.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET Defendants _______ J. DONELON, LOU- ISIANA . \u00a7 1746 _______ INTRODUCTION 1. My name is James J. Donelon and I am the Lou- isiana Commissioner of Insurance. 2. As Commissioner, I am the head of the Louisi- ana Department of Insurance ( \"LDI\" ) and the chief regulator of insurance in Louisiana pursuant to Arti- cle IV , Section 11 of the Louisiana Constitution. 3. The LDI is responsible for regulating the Louisi- ana health insurance market and protecting consumers in this market. The LDI performs a variety of tasks to protect insurance consumers and to ensure a competiti ve health insurance market environment, including: a. Licensing insurance companies and moni- toring their financial solvency to make sure that consumers have the insurance cover- age they expect when they need it; 354 b. Conducting examinations of foreign and do- mestic insurers doing business in Louisiana to ensure compliance with Louisiana laws, rules and regulations; c. Reviewing insurance policies to be sold in Louisiana to ensure compliance with Loui- siana and federal law; d. Issuing licenses to producers, brokers, third party administrators, and other entities that sell, market and administer insurance products; e. Investigating consumer complaints against insurance companies, producers, and other entities involved in the business of insur- ance doing business in Louisiana; f. Researching special insurance issues to un- derstand and assess their impact on the cit- izens of Louisiana; g. Providing technical assistance on legisla- tion and promulgating rules and regula- tions in accordance with the Louisiana Insurance Code; h. Creating and distributing consumer educa- tion materials and public information for many types of insurance; i. Taking administrative action including fines, license suspension, and/or license revocation against entities found to be in vi-olation of the provisions of the Louisiana Insurance Code; j. Taking action to initiate rehabilitation, con- servation, or liquidation proceedings of companies determined to be in financially 355 hazardous condition or determined to be in- solvent; 4. As the Louisiana Commissioner of Insurance, my duties include monitoring the impact of the Afford-able Care Act ( \"ACA\" ) on Louisiana 's insurance mar- ket, ensuring Louisiana 's compliance with the ACA, advising the Louisiana Governor and legislature on the ACA, and developing strategies for Louisiana to mitigate the numerous harms the ACA has inflicted on Louisiana 's health insurance markets. HARMS CAUSED BY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT 5. Title 1 of the ACA included market reforms that guaranteed minimum coverage of certain health care services, prohibited lifetime and annual limits, limited the ability of insurers to charge premiums based on gender, age, and health, as well as other lesser reforms that had an impact on pricing. The ma- jor reforms went into effect in 2014. 6. Louisiana has been very adversely affected by the market reforms of the ACA. Loss ratios for insur-ers operating in Louisiana skyrocketed and those sus-tained losses by insurers has led to market withdrawals, decreased competition, fewer product choices and higher premiums. 7. In 2013, prior to the effective date of the major provisions of the ACA, there were sixteen (16) insur-ance companies writing major medical insurance poli-cies in the individual market in Louisiana. As their profits dwindled and losses mounted, companies b e- gan exiting the individual market. In 2018 there are essentially only two insurers writing individual major medical policies in Louisiana. 356 8. In 2013, prior to the effective date of the major provisions of the ACA, premiums increased an aver- age of 3.7 per cent (3.7%) in the Louisiana individual market. In 2014, due to the mandates of the ACA, pre- miums increased by fifty -three percent (53%) and have continued to increase by double digits every year. The average rate increase in the individual market was seventeen percent (17%) in 2015, fourteen percent (14%) in 2016, thirty -three percent (33%) in 2017, and eighteen and one half percent (18.5%) in 2018. Addi-tionally, total market enrollment is down significantly as premiums continue to rise. The viability and con- tinued existence of the individual market in Louisiana is threatened by rising premiums and reduced enroll- ment. 9. Health insurance premiums are predicted to continue to rise. The Congressional Budget Office' s April 2018 \" Budget and Economic Outlook: 20 18 to 2028\" estimates that, under current law, Federal out- lays for health insurance subsidies and related spend-ing will rise by about sixty percent (60%) over the projection period, increasing from $58 billion in 2018 to $91 billion by 2028. (cbo.gov/publi cation/53651). These rising premiums have a significant negative im-pact on Louisiana 's middle -class as fewer employers offer health insurance coverage due to increasing pre- miums. 10. The LDI, as the primary enforcer of insurance laws, has spent the past si x years reading, studying, interpreting, and enforcing federal regulations and additional guidance related to the ACA. The LDI com-pletely revised its insurance policy review standards for health insurance products, educated the public on changes in the Law , and handled consumer com- plaints expressing confusion and frustration about the 357 limited, expensive choices that remain in the Louisi- ana individual market. 11. Additionally, Louisiana has been harmed by the ACA because it has preempted Louisiana law, pre-venting the Louisiana Department of Insurance from regulating health insurance in the manner it deems best for consumers. 12. Finally, the ACA has harmed the Louisiana health insurance market by providing for the estab-lishment of the Consumer Operated and Or iented Plan (Co -op) Program. The program was intended to foster the creation of nonprofit health insurance issu-ers to offer health plans in the individual and small group markets as an alternative to commercial insur- ance to create competition and drive dow n premiums. The onerous restrictions placed on the Co- ops as well as inadequate funding contributed to the downfall of the vast majority of the original twenty -three (23) Co - ops created nationwide. Almost every Co- op has been financially troubled and most have failed, including Louisiana 's Co -op, Louisiana Health Cooperative (\"LAHC \"). LAHC was placed in Rehabilitation by a Louisiana court on September 1, 2015 and the LDI has spent considerable resources overseeing the Rehabili- tation of LAHC to protect the c onsumers and healthcare providers affected by the failure of the Co- op. The ACA' s Co-op Program has cost taxpayers na- tionwide more than $1.8 billion to date. I DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE FOREGOING IS TRUE AND CORRECT. 358 Executed in Baton Ro uge, Louisiana, this 2ND day of MAY, 2018. /s/ James J. Donelon James J.

CIOPPA, MAINE SUPERINTENDENT OF INSURANCE PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C . \u00a7 17 46 _______ 1. My name is Eric Cioppa. I am the Superinten- dent of Insurance for the State of Maine. 2. As Superintendent of Insurance, I am the head of the Bureau of lnsurance within the Maine De- partment of Professional and Financial Regulation. Generally, my official duties include supervising the agency, serving as final adjudicator of all administra-tive actions, and serving on various councils and com-mittees. As a member of the State Employee Health Commission, I have first -hand experience with the manage ment and operations of a large self -insured health plan. 3. The duties of the Maine Bureau of Insurance include: a. Assisting insurance consumers with their insurance problems; 360 b. Conducting examinations of foreign and do- mestic insurers doing business in M aine to ensure compliance with Maine laws and rules; c. Monitoring the financial solvency of li- censed companies to make sure that con- sumers have the insurance coverage they expect when they need it; d. Reviewing insurance policies sold in Maine to ensure compliance with Maine and fed-eral law; e. Issuing licenses to agents, brokers, consult-ants, and other entities that sell and mar-ket insurance products; f. Researching special insurance issues to un-derstand and assess their impact on Main-ers; g. Providing te chnical assistance on legisla- tion, adopting rules to implement insurance laws, and issuing bulletins and other inter- pretive guidance; h. Creating and distributing public infor- mation and consumer education about all types of insurance; and i. When insurance companies are in finan- cially hazardous condition or have become insolvent, working with the guaranty asso- ciations made up of insurance companies, which by statute must step in and pay poli- cyholder claims when an insurer fails. 4. In addition to the implementation and en- forcement of the Maine Insurance Code, my duties in-clude the implementation and enforcement of other 361 state and federal statutes to the extent that they pro- vide for administration or enforcement by the Super- intendent. Federal law mandates tha t I enforce those provisions enacted by HIPAA and the ACA that have been codified in the federal Public Health Service Act. 5. In 1993, Maine mandated guaranteed issu- ance of coverage and modified community rating in its individual health insurance market w ithout any man- date to purchase coverage. 6. As explained in Pages 30 and 31 of the Plain- tiffs\" Brief in Support of their Motion for Preliminary Injunction, the government argued in NFIB v. Sebe-lius that without an individual mandate, guaranteed issue and c ommunity rating \" would drive up costs and reduce coverage, \" leading to \" a marketwide adverse- selection death spiral, \" and \"the market will blow up. \" 7. That is precisely what happened in Maine. Under Maine 's guaranteed -issue law, coverage be- came increasing ly unaffordable, even for consumers willing to purchase plans with per -person deductibles as high as $20,000. By 2010, there was only one carrier offering comprehensive health plans. Only 30,000 Mainers were enrolled in the individual market, while 110,000 were uninsured. 8. The ACA implementation has led to a lack of choices in coverage, and failed to live up to its promise of affordability. Consumers with one of the most widely purchased plans in 2013, the Anthem HealthChoice 15000 plan, were mapped by An them into the ACA -compliant Bronze Guided Access plan for 2014. The resulting premium increase for consum-ers aged 30 to 60 ranged from 48.1% to 122.7%, de- pending on age and geographic area. Outside Rating 362 Area 1 (which includes Portland) the smallest incre ase for the other three rating areas was 78.5%. 9. Premiums under the ACA continue to rise. Carriers ' average individual rate increases in Maine ranged from 18.0% to 25.5% in 2017, and ranged from 19.6% to 39.7% in 2018. 10. The cost of insurance is particularly burden- some for consumers who earn more than 400% of the Federal Poverty Level ( \"400 % FPL \") and are not eli- gible for premium subsidies. This year, the unsubsi- dized premium for a 45 -year- old nonsmoking couple with two young children ranges from $16,9 78.80 to $25,094.40 for the lowest -priced Silver plan, depend- ing on which county they live in. These plans are not offered on the Exchange, so the price is not artificially increased by the cost of the Cost -Sharing reductions. Even if this family were to b uy a Catastrophic plan, the annual premium for the lowest -priced plan would range from $9909.84 to $14,409.12, depending on ge-ography. 11. Even for consumers who are eligible for subsi- dies, the cost of ACA -compliant insurance is often out of reach. Under t he ACA, subsidies are only available if the price of the second -lowest- cost Silver plan (the \"baseline \" plan) exceeds a specified percentage of in- come. When subsidies are available, they are calcu- lated so that the consumer must pay that percentage of their income as the premium for the baseline plan, and must also pay the applicable deductible and other cost sharing. For example; for consumers making be- tween 300% and 400% FPL, the subsidized premium for the baseline plan is equal to 9.56% of their house- hold income in premium. This year, for a family of four, 400% of the Federal Poverty Level ( \"400% FPL\" ) is $100,400 and 300% FPL is $75,300. This makes 363 their subsidized premium $7,198.68 per year at 300% FPL and $9,598.24 at 400% FPL. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct, based on my personal knowledge and on information contained within the records of the Maine Bureau of Insurance, Department of Profes- sional and Financial Regulation.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , ET AL ., Defendants, CALIFORNIA , ET Defendants _______ _______ PLAINTIFFS ' STATEMENT ON CONSIDERA- TION OF THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE INDIVIDU AL MANDATE ON SUMMARY JUDGMENT _______ On July 16, the Court issued an order, Doc. 176, noting Federal Defendants ' opposition to Plaintiffs ' re- quest for the issuance of immediate injunctive relief and their suggestion that the Court \" consider constru- ing Plaintiffs ' motion as a request for summary judg- ment . . . .\" Doc. 92, Defs. PI Br.20. The Court has provided the parties an opportunity to present addi- tional information in opposition to the Court consider-ing the issues raised by Plaintiffs ' application for preliminary injunction in the summary judgment pos-ture. Doc. 176. For the reasons discussed below, Plain-tiffs maintain that preliminary injunctive relief is necessary and the Court must treat Plaintiffs ' applica- tion for a preliminary injunction as requesting that re- lief under applicable standards. That said, because the parties agree that the matters currently before the Court are purely issues of law, Plaintiffs do not oppose 366 the Court also and simultaneously considering Plain- tiffs' application as a motion for partial summary judg- ment on the constitutionality of the ACA 's mandate. *** In their response to Plaintiffs ' application for pre- liminary injunction, Federal Defendants assert that \"the injury imposed by the individual mandate is not sufficiently imminent to warrant preliminary injun c- tive relief, especially where final adjudication would be possible before that injury occurs. \" Defs. PI Br.20 (citing Aransas Project v. Shaw , 775 F.3d 641, 664 (5th Cir. 2014), for the proposition that an injunction may \"be issued only if future injury i s 'certainly impend- ing'\"). Federal Defendants agree that the ACA 's individ- ual mandate will be unconstitutional with the repeal of the tax penalty taking effect in 2019. Defs. PI Br.20. It is thus undisputed \u2014at least as between Plaintiffs and Federal Defen dants \u2014that Plaintiffs have met their burden of showing a constitutional injury suffi-cient to constitute irreparable harm. See Doc. 40, Pls. PI Br. 41 -48; Doc. 175, Pls. PI Reply Br.21 -26. This impending harm is sufficient to justify a preliminary injunctio n. \"[T]he injury need not have been inflicted when application is made or be certain to occur; a strong threat of irreparable injury before trial is an ad- equate basis. \" United States v. Emerson , 270 F.3d 203, 262 (5th Cir. 2001) (emphasis added) (quoting 9 Wright, Miller & Kane, F ED. PRAC. & PROC. \u00a7 2948.1 at 153- 56)). Because the focus is on whether irrepara- ble harms will flow to the movant prior to trial, and because Federal Defendants do not contest those harms, their focus on whether Plaintiffs ' injury is \"suf- ficiently imminent \" is misplaced. 367 And contrary to Federal Defendants ' suggestion that \"final adjudication would be possible before that injury occurs, \" Defs. PI Br.20, it would be remarkable for this Court to resolve all issues in this case and en- ter final judgment before January 1, 2019. Not only are the issues in this case particularly complex and important, but only one of Plaintiffs ' four claims is cur- rently before the Court: Plaintiffs ' preliminary injunc- tion application does not address their Due Process Clause, Tenth Amendment, or APA claims. See Pls. 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b661 -83. Because issuing a final judg- ment on every issue and claim raised in this suit prior to January 1, 2019\u2014the day that the irreparable harm to the plaintiffs begins \u2014is highly unlikely, if not nearly impossible, Plaintiffs ' preliminary injunction application is the only way for Plaintiffs to obtain re- lief from the irreparable harms their record evidence has established. Federal Defendants and Plaintiffs do agree, how- ever, that the constitutionality of the ACA 's mandate is a \" pure question of law. \" Defs. PI Br.20. Discovery and further factual development of the record are un- necessary for the Court to determine whether the mandate falls upon the elimination of the tax penalty. For that reason, the Court could treat Plaintiffs ' appli- cation for preliminary injunction as a combined appli- cation for preliminary injunction and motion for partial summary judgment on their declaratory judg-ment claim that the mandate exceeds Congress 's Arti- cle I powers. See Pls. 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b648 -60; e.g., AFL-CIO , 892 F.2d 1238, 1269 (5th Cir. 1990) (affirming summary judgment granted prior to discovery being conducted because \" many of the issues raised by the summar y judgment motions were purely legal and . . . discovery would therefore not aid their resolution \"); Rosas v. 368 U.S. Small Bus. Admin., 964 F.2d 351, 359 (5th Cir. 1992) ( \"As the issues to be decided by the district court were purely legal in nature, the cou rt did not abuse its discretion in deciding the summary judgment motion prior to completion of discovery. \"). Construing Plaintiffs ' application in this way would not change any standards for the granting or denial of either motion, but would serve judicial econ- omy because there is no need for the parties to rehash the legal issues surrounding the unconstitutionality of the individual mandate \u2014and the severability of the remainder of the ACA \u2014on later summary judgment briefing en route to a final resolution of this litigation. 1 Dated: July 30, 2018 B RAD D.

The Intervenor States understand that Order not as a re- quest to present additional evidence or arguments they might submit in support of (or in opposition to) a motion for summary judgment, but instead a request to identify for the Court what evidence and argument they might wish to raise during summary judgment briefing. The Intervenor States respectfully submit that this Court should not convert the briefing on the prelimi-nary injunction application into a motion for summary 371 judgment. The Intervenor States ' opposition to the ap- plication for a preliminary injunction focused on the legal and evidentiary standards that govern that re- lief. At the summary judgment stage, however, the In-tervenor States would be afforded an opportunity to more ful ly brief legal issues that the preliminary in- junction legal standard and page limitations did not permit previously. These issues include, but are not limited to: (1) whether Plaintiffs have Article III standing to challenge the constitutionality of the mi n- imum coverage provision; (2) whether the minimum coverage requirement under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A may now be sustained under the Commerce Clause, see State Defendants ' Br. In Opp. to Plaintiffs ' Application for a Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 91, at 18 n.17; (3) whether an injunction limited to the 20 Plaintiff States is legally supportable and whether it would harm the Intervenor States, 1 (4) whether regulations promulgated under the Affordable Care Act remain lawful if the minimum coverage provision, or an y other provisions, are struck down; (5) whether the Su-preme Court 's \"modern severability precedents \" are consistent with \" longstanding limits on judicial power,\" Murphy v. Nat 'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n , Ct. 1461, 1487 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurri ng); and (6) whether Plaintiffs can meet their burden of demon- strating that they are entitled to a permanent injunc- tion, see, e.g., eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC , 547 U.S. 388, 391 (identifying factors that a plaintiff seek- ing permanent injunctive relief must satisfy). If the 1 The Plaintiff States requested this narrower injunctive relief for the first time in their Preliminary Injunction Reply Brief. See ECF No. 175 at 29-30. 372 Court nevertheless intends to move straight to sum- mary judgment at this time, it should permit the par- ties the opportunity to submit supplemental briefing which will enable the parties to place all of the legal and factual issues in t his case before the Court. 2 See Underwood v. Hunter , 604 F.2d 367, 369 (5th Cir. 1979) (when only a preliminary injunction is pending, \"we cannot say with assurance that the parties will present everything they have. The very intimation of mortality when summary judgment is at issue assures us that the motion will be rebutted with every factual and legal argument available. \"). Based upon all of the foregoing, the Intervenor States \u2014in agreement with the Plaintiffs \u2014urge the Court to decline the Federal Defend ants' invitation to convert the pending prelimi- nary injunction application into another motion. If the Court determines that summary judgment is appro- priate at this time, however, the Intervenor States re- spectfully request that the Court grant the parties a 30-day period to file supplemental briefing on the ad- ditional issues identified above (and perhaps others).

JENNIFER WALKER ELROD, Circuit Judge: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Act or ACA) is a monumental piece of healthcare legislation that regulates a huge swath of the nation 's economy and affects the healthcare decisions of mil- lions of Americans. The law has been a focal point of our country 's political debate since it was passed nearly a decade ago. Some say that the Act is a much - needed solution to the problem of increasing healthcare costs and lack of healthca re availability. Many of the amici in this case, for example, argue that 375 the law has extensively benefitted everyone from children to senior citizens to local governments to small businesses. Others say that the Act is a costly exercise in burdensome gov ernmental regulation that deprives people of economic liberty. Amici of this per- spective argue, for example, that the Act \"has deprived patients nationwide of a competitive market for af- fordable high-deductible health insurance, \" leaving \"patients with no alternative to . . . skyrocketing pre- miums. \" Association of American Physicians & Sur- geons Amicus Br. at 15. None of these policy issues are before the court. And for good reason \u2014the courts are not institutionally equipped to address them. These issues are far better left to the other two branches of government. The questions before the court are far narrower: questions of law, not of policy. Those questions are: First, is there a live case or controversy before us even though the federal defendants have conceded many aspects of the dispute; and, relatedly, do the intervenor -defend- ant states and the U.S. House of Representatives have standing to appeal? Second, do the plaintiffs have standing? Third, if they do, is the individual mandate unconstitutional? Fourth, if it is, how much of the rest of the Act is inseverable from the individual mandate? We answer those questions as follows: First, there is a live case or controversy because the intervenor - defendant states have standing to appeal and, ev en if they did not, there remains a live case or controversy between the plaintiffs and the federal defendants. Sec- ond, the plaintiffs have Article III standing to bring this challenge to the ACA; the individual mandate in- jures both the individual plaintiffs, by requiring them to buy insurance that they do not want, and the state 376 plaintiffs, by increasing their costs of complying with the reporting requirements that accompany the indi- vidual mandate. Third, the individual mandate is un- constitutional becaus e it can no longer be read as a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that jus-tifies this exercise of congressional power. Fourth, on the severability question, we remand to the district court to provide additional analysis of the provisions of the ACA as they currently exist. I. On March 23, 2010, President Barack Obama signed the ACA into law. See Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010). The Act sought to \"increase the number of Americans cove red by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care\" through several key reforms. See Nat 'l Fed 'n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius (NFIB) , 567 U.S. 519, 538 (2012). Some of those reforms implemented new consumer protections, aiming primarily to protect people with preexisting conditions. For example, the law prohibits insurers from refusing to cover preexisting conditions. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg -3. The \"guaranteed- issue require- ment\" forbids insurers from turning customers away because of their health. Se e 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300gg, 300gg - 1. The \" community -rating requirement \" keeps insur- ers from charging people more because of their preex-isting health issues. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg -4. 1 The law 1 The ACA features a few other consumer -protection reforms of note. For example, the Act requires insurance companies to allow young adults to stay on their parents' health insurance plans un-til they turn 26; prohibits insurers from imposing caps on the 377 also requires insurers to provide coverage for certain types of care, i ncluding women' s and children 's pre- ventative care. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg -13(a)(3)- (4).2 Other reforms sought to lower the cost of health in- surance by using both policy \" carrots \" and \"sticks. \"3 value of benefits provided; and mandates that the insurance plans cover at least ten \"essential health benefits,\" including emergency services, prescription drugs, and maternity and newborn care. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300gg -14 (young adults), 300gg -11 (restriction on benefit caps), 18022 (essential health benefits). The ACA also requires employers with at least fifty full -time employees to pay the federal government a penalty if they fail to provide their em-ployees with ACA- compliant coverage. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H. 2 The women's preventative care provision was at issue in a trio of recent Supreme Court cases. See Zubik v. Burwell , Inc. , 573 U.S. 682 (2014); see also California v. U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs. , No. 19 - 15072, 2019 WL 5382250 (9th Cir. Oct. 22, 2019); Pennsylvania v. President United States , 930 F.3d 543 (3d Cir. 2019), as amended (July 18, 2019); DeOtte v. Azar , 393 F. Supp. 3d 490, 495 (N.D. Tex. 2019). 3 Some opponents of the ACA assert that the goal was not to lower health insurance costs, but that the entire law was enacted as part of a fraud on the American people, designed to ultimately lead to a federal, single -payer healthcare system. In a hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, for ex-ample, Representative Kerry Bentivolio suggested that Jonathan Gruber, who assisted in crafting the legislation, had \"help[ed] the administration deceive the America n people on this healthcare act or [told] the truth in [a] video . . . about how [the Act] was the American people.\" Examining Obamacare Trans- parency Failures: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on Oversight and Government Reform , 113th Cong. 83 (2014) (statement of Rep. Kerry Bentivolio). 378 On the stick side, the individual mandate \u2014which plaintiffs challenge in the instant case \u2014requires indi- viduals to \" maintain [health insurance] coverage. \" 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(a). If individuals do not maintain this coverage, they must make a payment to the IRS called a \"shared responsibility payment. \"4 Id.; see also King v. Burwell , 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2486 (2015). The individual mandate was designed to lower in- surance premiums by broadening the insurance pool. See 42 mandate] will significantly . . . lower health insurance premiums. \"). When the young and healthy must buy insurance, the insurance pool faces less risk, which, at least in theory, leads to lower premiums for everyone. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(I) (posi ting that the individ- ual mandate will \" broaden the health insurance risk pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health insurance premiums \"). The individual man- date thus serves as a counterweight to the ACA 's pro- tections for preexisting cond itions, which push riskier, costlier individuals into the insurance pool. Under the protections for consumers with preexisting conditions, if there were no individual mandate, there would ar- 4 The Act exempts several groups of people from the shared re- sponsibility payment. Specifically, the Act provides that \"[n]o penalty shall be imposed\" on those \"who cannot afford [insurance] coverage,\" on with [the] filing threshold,\" on \"[m]embers of Indian tribes,\" on those who had only \"short coverage gaps,\" or on anyone who, in the Secretary of Health and Human Services' determination, has \"suffered a hardship.\" 26 U.S.C. many indi- viduals woul d,\" in theory, \" wait to purchase health in- surance until they needed care. \" Id.5 The Act also sought to lower insurance costs for some consumers through policy \" carrots, \" providing tax credits to offset the cost of insurance to those with incomes under 400 percent of the federal poverty line. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 36B; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18081, 18082. The Act created government -run, taxpayer -funded health insurance marketplaces \u2014known as \" Ex- changes \"\u2014which allow customers \" to compare and purchase insurance plans. \" King , 135 S. Ct. at 2485; see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18031. Opponents of the law ar- gue that the law has led to unintended subsidies to keep plans afloat and insurance companies in the black. Texas points in its brief, for example, to a Con-gressional Budget Office study estimating that federal outlays for health insurance subsidies and related spending will rise by about 60 percent over the next ten years, from $58 billion in 2018 to $91 billion by 2028. CBO, The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2018 to 2028 5 Opponents of the ACA, however, argue that the Act goes too far in limiting individuals' freedom to choose healthcare coverage. For example, at a House committee hearing, Representative Dar-rell Issa argued that one of the \"false claims\" that th e Obama administration made in passing the Act was that \"[i]f you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. . . . [And i]f you like your plan.\" Exam- ining Obamacare Transparency Failures: Hearing Be fore the H. Comm. on Oversight and Government Reform , 113th Cong. 2 (2014) (statement of Rep. Darrell Issa, Chairman, H. Comm. on Oversight and Government Reform). 380 at 51 (April 2018), available at https://ti- nyurl.com/CBOBudgetEconOutlook- 2018- 2028; State Plaintiffs ' Br. at 13- 14. The ACA also enlarged the class of people eligible for Medicaid to include childless adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal pov erty line. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 U.S. at 541-42. The ACA originally required each state to expand its Medicaid program or risk losing \" all of its federal Medicaid funds. \" NFIB , 567 U.S. at 542. In NFIB , however, the Supreme Court held that this exceeded Congress ' powers under the Spending Clause. Id. at 585 (plurality opinion). But the Court allowed those states that wanted to accept Medicaid expansion funds to do so. See id. at 585- 86 (plurality opinion) ; id. at 645- 46 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part, concurring in the judgment in part, and dissent-ing in part). As a result, the states that have not par- ticipated in the expansion now subsidize, through their general tax dollars, the states that have part icipated in expansion. Since the Act was passed, its opponents have at- tempted to attack it both through congressional amendment and through litigation. Between 2010 and 2016, Congress considered several bills to repeal, defund, delay, or amend the ACA. S ee Intervenor-De- fendant States ' Br. at 10. Except for a few modest changes, these efforts were closely fought but ulti-mately failed. Intervenor -Defendant States ' Br. at 10- 11. In 2017, the shift in presidential administrations reinvigorated opposition to the law, but many of these later legislative efforts failed as well. In March 2017, House leaders pulled a bill that would have repealed many of the ACA 's essential provisions. In July 2017, 381 the Senate voted on three separate bills that similarly would have repealed major provisions of the Act, but each vote failed.6 Finally, in September 2017, several Senators introduced another bill that would have re-pealed some of the ACA 's most significant provisions, but Senate leaders ultimately chose not to brin g it to the floor for a vote. Intervenor -Defendant States ' Br. at 11. The ACA' s opponents also took their cause to the courts in a series of lawsuits, some of which reached the Supreme Court. Particularly relevant here, the Court, in NFIB , upheld the law 's individual mandate. 567 U.S. at 574. Through fractured voting and shift- ing majorities \u2014explained in more detail in Part V of this opinion \u2014the Court decided that the ACA 's indi- vidual mandate could be read as a tax on an individ- ual's decision not to purc hase insurance, which was a constitutional exercise of Congress ' taxing powers un- der Article I of the U.S. Constitution. Id. ; U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1. The Court favored this tax interpreta- tion to save the provision from unconstitutionality. Readi ng the provision as a standalone command to purchase insurance would have rendered it unconsti- tutional. This reading could not have been justified under the Commerce Clause because it would have done more than \" regulate commerce . . . among the several st ates. \" U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. It would have compelled individuals to enter commerce in the 6 One of these bills failed by a razor -thin vote of fifty -one against, forty- nine in favor. See 163 Cong. Rec. S4415 (daily ed. July 27, 2017). 382 first place.7 NFIB , 567 U.S. at 557 -58. The Court also held that the provision could not be justified under the Constitution 's Necessary and Proper Clau se. Id. at 561 (Roberts, C.J.); id. at 654-55 (Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., dissenting). In December 2017, the ACA 's opponents achieved some legislative success. As part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Congress set the \" shared responsibility pa y- ment\" amount \u2014the amount a person must pay for failing to comply with the individual mandate \u2014to the \"lesser \" of \" zero percent \" of an individual's household income or \"$0,\" effective January 2019. Pub. L. No. 115-97, \u00a7 11081, 131 Stat. U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(c). The individual mandate is still \"on the books \" of the U.S. Code and still consists of the three fundamental components it always featured. Subsection (a) prescribes that certain individuals \"shall . . . ensure \" that they and their dependents are \"covered under minimum essential coverage. \" 26 called a \" [s]hared responsibility payment \" on those who fail to ensure they have minimum essential coverage. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5 000A(b). Subsection (c) sets the amount of that payment. All Congress did in 2017 was change the amount in subsection (c) to zero dol- lars. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(c). 7 Chief Justice Roberts cautioned that concluding otherwise would empower the government to compel Americans into all kinds of behavior that the government thinks is beneficial for them, including, for e xample, compelling them to purchase broc- coli. See NFIB , 567 U.S. at 558 (Roberts, C.J.). 383 Two months after the shared responsibility pay- ment was set at zero dollars, the plaintiffs h ere\u2014two private citizens8 and eighteen states9\u2014filed this law- suit against several federal defendants: the United States of America, the Department of Health and Hu- man Services and its Secretary, Alex Azar, as well as the Internal Revenue Service and its Ac ting Commis- sioner, David J. Kautter. The plaintiffs argued that the individual mandate was no longer constitutional because: (1) NFIB rested the individual mandate 's constitutionality exclusively on reading the provision as a tax; and (2) the 2017 amendm ent undermined any ability to characterize the individual mandate as a tax because the provision no longer generates revenue, a requirement for a tax. The plaintiffs argued further that, because the individual mandate was essential to and inseverable from the rest of the ACA, the entire ACA must be enjoined. On this theory, the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and the rest of the ACA is insever- able. The plaintiffs also sought an injunction prohib- iting t he federal defendants from enforcing any provision of the ACA or its regulations. The federal defendants agreed with the plaintiffs that once the shared responsibility payment was re-duced to zero dollars, the individual mandate was no 8 Namely, Neill Hurley and John Nantz. 9 Namely, Texas, Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Da- kota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Vir- ginia, and Arkansas. Wisconsin, which was originally a plaintiff state, sought and was granted dismissal from the appeal. 384 longer constitutional. They also agreed that the indi- vidual mandate could not be severed from the ACA 's guaranteed- issue and community -rating require- ments. Unlike the plaintiffs, however, the federal de-fendants contended in the district court that those three provisions could be severed from the rest of the Act. Driven by the federal defendants ' decision not to fully defend against the lawsuit, sixteen states 10 and the District of Columbia intervened to defend the ACA. The district court agreed with the plaintiffs ' argu- ments on the merits. Specifically, the court held that: (1) the individual plaintiffs had standing because the individual mandate compelled them to purchase in- surance; (2) setting the shared responsibility payment to zero rendered the individual mandate unconst itu- tional; and (3) the unconstitutional provision could not be severed from any other part of the ACA. The dis- trict court granted the plaintiffs ' claim for declaratory relief. Specifically, the district court 's order \" declares the Individual Mandate, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(a), UN-CONSTITUTIONAL, \" and the order further declares that \"the remaining provisions of the ACA, Pub L. 111 - 148, are INSEVERABLE and therefore INVALID. \" The district court, however, denied the plaintiffs ' ap- plication for a preliminary injun ction. The district court entered partial final judgment 11 as to the grant 10 Namely, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Caro- lina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Minnesota. 11 The final judgment is only partial because it addresses only 385 of summary judgment for declaratory relief, but stayed judgment pending appeal. This appeal fol- lowed. On appeal, the U.S. House of Representatives in- tervened to join the intervenor -defendant states in de- fending the ACA.12 Also on appeal, the federal defendants changed their litigation position. After contending in the district court that only a few provi- sions of the ACA were inseverable from the individual mandate, the federal defendants contend in their opening brief for the first time that all of the ACA is inseverable. See Fed. Defendants ' Br. at 43- 49. More- over, the federal defendants contend for the first time on appeal that \u2014even though the entire ACA is inse- verable \u2014the court should not enjoin the enforcement of the entire ACA. The federal defendants now argue that the district court 's judgment should be affirmed Count One of the plaintiffs' amended complaint. Count One re- quests a declaratory judgment that the individual mandate ex-ceeds Congress' constitutional powers. The district court has not yet ruled on the other counts in the amended complaint. In Count Two, the plaintiffs request a declaratory judgment that the ACA violates the D ue Process Clause of the Fifth Amend- ment. In Count Three, the plaintiffs request a declaratory judg-ment that the ACA violates the Tenth Amendment. In Count Four, the plaintiffs request a declaratory judgment that agency rules promulgated pursuant to the ACA are unlawful. In Count Five, the plaintiffs request an injunction prohibiting fed-eral officials from \"implementing, regulating, or otherwise en-forcing any part of the ACA.\" 12 In addition to the U.S. House, four other states intervened on appeal to joi n the original group that defended the Act in the dis- trict court: Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, and Nevada. 386 \"except insofar as it purports to extend relief to ACA provisions that are unnecessary to remedy plaintiffs' injuries.\"13 Fed. Defendants' Br. at 49. They also now argue that the district cour t's judgment \"cannot be un- derstood as extending beyond the plaintiff states to in-validate the ACA in the intervenor states.\" Fed. Defendants' Supp. Br. at 10. Simply put, the federal defendants have shifted their position on appeal more than once. II. We review a district court's grant of summary judg- ment de novo . Time Warner Cable, Inc. v. Hudson , 667 F.3d 630, 638 (5th Cir. 2012). Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the mo- vant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Dialysis Newco, Inc. v. Cmty. Health Sys. Grp. Health Plan , 938 F.3d 246, 250 (5th Cir. 2019). A dispute about a material fact is genuine if \"the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.\" Amerisure Ins. v. Navigators Ins. , 611 F.3d 299, 304 (5th Cir. 2010) (quoting Gates v. Tex. Dep't of Protective & Reg- ulatory Servs. , 537 F.3d 404, 417 (5th Cir. 2008)). When ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court views all inferences drawn from the factual rec- ord \"in the light most favorable to the non-moving par- ties below.\" Trent v. Wade , 776 F.3d 368, 373 n.1 (5th Cir. 2015). 13 The federal defendants do not specify which precise provisions, in their view, injure the plaintiffs and which do not. 387 III. We first must consider whether there is a live \"[c]ase\" or \"[c]ontroversy\" before us on appeal, as Arti- cle III of the U.S. Constituti on requires. U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 1. A case or controversy does not exist unless the person asking the court for a decision\u2014in this case, asking us to decide whether the district court's judgment was correct\u2014has standing, which requires a showing of \"injury, causation, and redressability.\" Si- erra Club v. Babbitt F.2d 571, 574 (5th Cir. 1993). When \"standing to appeal is at issue, appellants must demonstrate some injury from the judgment below.\" Id. at 575 (emphasis omitted). We conclude, as all parties agree, that there is a case or controversy before us on appeal. Two groups of parties appealed from the district court's judgment: the federal defendants, and the intervenor-defendant states. 14 There is a case or controversy before us be- cause both of these groups have their own independent standing to appeal.15 The federal defendants have standing to appeal. The instant case is on all fours with the Supreme 14 The U.S. House of Representatives, also a party in this case, in- tervened in our court after the intervenor-defendant states and the federal government had filed notices of appeal. 15 Even if only one of these parties had standing to appeal, that would be enough to sustain the co urt's jurisdiction. An interve- nor needs standing only \"in the absence of the party on whose side the intervenor intervened.\" Sierra Club, 995 F.2d at 574 (al- teration omitted) (quoting Diamond v. Charles , 476 U.S. 54, 68 (1986)); see also Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp. , 429 U.S. 252, 264 & n.9 (1977) (e xercising jurisdiction be- cause \"at least one\" plaintiff had standing to sue). 388 Court's decision in United States v. Windsor , 570 U.S. 744 (2013). In that case, th e executive branch of the federal government declined to defend a federal stat- ute that did not allow the surviving spouse of a same-sex couple to receive a spousal tax deduction. Id. at 749-53. The district court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional and ordered the executive branch to issue a tax refund to the surviving spouse. Id. at 754- 55. The executive branch agreed with the district court's legal conclusion, but it appealed the judgment and continued to enforce the statute by withholding the tax refund until a final judicial resolution. Id. at 757- 58. The Supreme Court ruled that \"the United States retain[ed] a stake sufficient to support Article III ju- risdiction.\" Id. at 757. That stake was the tax refund, which the federal government refused to pay. This threat of payment of money from the Treasury consti- tuted \"a real and immediate economic injury\" to the federal government, which was sufficient for standing purposes. Id. at 757-58 (quoting Hein v. Freedom From Religion Found., Inc. , 551 U.S. 587, 599 (2007) (plurality opinion)). As the Court explained, \"the re-fusal of the Executive to provide the relief sought suf- fices to preserve a justici able dispute as required by Article III.\" Id. at 759; see also Food Mk tg. Inst. v. Ar- gus Leader Media , 139 S. Ct. 2356, 2362 (2019) (con- cluding that there was a justiciable controversy because the government \"represented unequivocally\" that it would not voluntarily moot the controversy ab- sent a final judicial order, and \"[t]hat is enough to sat-isfy Article III\"); INS v. Chadha , 462 U.S. 919, 939 (1983) (holding that there was \"adequate Art. III ad-verseness\" because the executive branch determined 389 that a federal statute was unconstitutional and re- fused to defend it but simultaneously continued to abide by it). The instant case is simila r. Though the plaintiffs and the federal defendants are in almost complete agreement on the merits of the case, the government continues to enforce the entire Act. The federal gov- ernment has made no indication that it will begin dis- mantling any part of the ACA in the absence of a final court order. Just as in Windsor, then, effectuating the district court's order would require the federal govern- ment to take actions that it would not take \"but for the court's order.\" Windsor , 570 U.S. at 758. And just as in Windsor, the federal defendants stand to suffer fi- nancially if the district co urt's judgment is affirmed. 16 As just one example, the di strict court's judgment de- clares the Act's Medicare reimbursement schedules unlawful, which, if given effect, would require Medi- care to reimburse healthcare providers at higher rates. See, e.g. , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(b) (3)(B)(xi)-(xii). Therefore, just as in Windsor, an appellate decision here will \"have real mean ing.\" 570 U.S. at 758 (quot- ing Chadha , 462 U.S. at 939). 17 16 The dissenting Justices in Windsor objected to the Windsor ma- jority's approach to standing. Justice Scalia, for example, said that this approach to standing \"would have been unrecognizable to those who wrote and ratified our national charter.\" Windsor , 570 U.S. at 779 (Scalia, J., dissenting). We are bound by the Windsor majority opinion. 17 Just as in Windsor , moreover, principles of prudential standing weigh in favor of exercising jurisdiction despite the government's alignment with the plaintiffs. Just like the intervenors in Wind- sor, the intervenor-defendant states and the U.S. House both put on a \"sharp adversarial presentation of the issues.\" Id. at 761. 390 The intervenor-defendant states also have stand- ing to appeal. While a party's mere \"status as an in- tervenor below . . . does not confer standing,\" Diamond v. Charles , 476 U.S. 54, 68 (1986), intervenors may ap- peal if they can demonstrate injury from the district court's judgment. Sierra Club , 995 F.2d at 574; see also Va. House of Delegates v. Bethune-Hill , 139 S. Ct. 1945, 1951 (2019); Cooper v. Tex. Alcoholic Beverage Comm'n , 820 F.3d 730, 737 (5th Cir. 2016). The inter- venor-defendant states have made this showing be- cause the district court's judgment, if ultimately given effect, would: (1) strip these states of funding that they receive under the ACA; and (2 ) threaten to hamstring these states in possible future litigation because of the district court judgment's potentially preclusive ef- fect. 18 First, the receive funding from the ACA, which would be discon- tinued if we affirmed the district court's judgment declaring the entire Act unconstitutional. \"[F]inancial loss as a result of\" a district court's judgment is an in- jury sufficient to support standing to appeal. United States v. Fletcher ex rel. Fletcher , 805 F.3d 596, 602 (5th Cir. 2015). In their supplemental briefing, the in-tervenor-defendant states identify a few examples of the funding sources they woul d lose under the district 18 At first glance, it may not be entirely clear how a mere partial summary judgment on the issuance of a declaratory judgment would aggrieve anyone. But at oral argument, all parties agreed that the district court's partia l summary judgment would have binding effect. Indeed, this is partly why the district court issued a stay. The district court acknowledged that the intervenor-de-fendant states would be prejudiced by the judgment, which means that the district court understood it to be binding. 391 court's judgment. Evidence in the record shows that eliminating the Act's Medicaid expansion provisions alone would cost the original sixteen intervening state defendants and the District of Columbia a total of more than $418 billion in the next decade. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII), (e)(14)(I)(i), 1396d(y)(1). Moreover, the Act's Community First Choice Option program gives states funding to care for the disabled and elderly at home or in their communi- ties instead of in institutions. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396n(k). Record evidence shows that eliminating this program would cost California $400 million in 2020, and that Oregon and Connecticut have already received $432.1 million under th is program. This evi- dence is more than enough to show that the interve-nor-defendant states would suffer financially if the district court's judgment is given effect, an injury suf- ficient to confer standing to appeal. See Dep't of Com- merce v. New York , 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2565 (2019). The district court's judgment, if given effect, also threatens to injure the intervenor-defendant states with the judgment's potentially preclusive effect in fu-ture litigation. We have held that \"[a] party may be aggrieved by a district court decision that adversely af- fects its legal rights or position vis-\u00e0-vis other parties in the case or other potential litigants.\" Leonard v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. , 499 F.3d 419, 428 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting Custer v. Sweeney , 89 F.3d 1156, 1164 (4th Cir. 1996)). If the federal defendants began un- winding the ACA, either in reliance on the district court's judgment or on thei r own, the district court's judgment would potentially estop the intervenor-de-fendant states from challengin g that action in court. This case thus stands in co ntrast to the cases in which 392 there was no chance whatsoever of a preclusive effect. See Klamath Strategic Inv. Fund ex rel. St. Croix Ven- tures v. United States , 568 F.3d 537, 546 (5th Cir. 2009) (holding that there was no threatened injury from potential estoppel fr om the appealed-from judg- ment because that judgment was interlocutory, not fi-nal, and therefore could not estop the appealing party). Finally, we examine the standing of the U.S. House of Representatives, which intervened after the case had been appealed. The Supreme Court's recent deci- sion in Virginia House of De legates v. Bethune-Hill calls the House's standing to intervene into doubt. 139 S. Ct. at 1953 (\"This Court has never held that a judi- cial decision invalidating a state law as unconstitu- tional inflicts a discrete, cognizable injury on each organ of government that participated in the law's passage.\"). However, we need not resolve the question of the House's standing. \"A rticle III does not require intervenors to independently possess standing\" when a party already in the lawsuit has standing and seeks the same \"ultimate relief\" as the intervenor. Ruiz v. Estelle , 161 F.3d 814, 830 (5th Ci r. 1998). That is the case here: the intervenor-defendant states have stand-ing to appeal, and the House seeks the same relief as those states. We accordingly pretermit the issue of whether the House has standing to intervene. IV. We now turn to the issue of whether any of the plaintiffs had Article III standing to bring this case at the time they brought the lawsuit. To be a case or con-troversy under Article III, th e plaintiffs must satisfy the same three requirements listed above. First, a 393 plaintiff must have suffered an \"injury in fact\"\u2014a vio- lation of a legally protected interest that is \"concrete and particularized,\" as we ll as \"actual or imminent, not 'conjectural' or 'hypothetical.'\" Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (quoting Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990)). Second, that injury must be \"fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged and not . . . th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.\" Id. (alterations in original) (quoting Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41-42 (1976)). Third, it must be \"likely\"\u2014not merely \"speculative\"\u2014 that the injury will be \"redressed by a favorable deci-sion.\" Id. at 561 (quoting Simon , 426 U.S. at 38, 43). The instant case has two groups of plaintiffs: the individual plaintiffs and the state plaintiffs. Only one plaintiff need succeed because \"one party with stand- ing is sufficient to satisfy Article III' s case-or-contro- versy requirement.\" 19 Texas v. United States (DAPA) , 809 F.3d 134, 151 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting Rumsfeld v. Forum for Acad. & Institutional Rights, Inc. , 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006)), aff'd by an lly divided court , 136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016).20 The individual plaintiffs and the state plaintiffs allege di fferent injuries. We eval- uate each in turn and conclude that both the individ- ual plaintiffs and the state plaintiffs have standing. 19 For an academic critique of this approach, see Aaron-Andrew P. Bruhl, One Good Plaintiff Is Not Enough , 67 Duke L. J. 481 (2017). 20 We refer to this 2015 case as \" DAPA \"\u2014after Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, the policy at issue there\u2014to prevent confusion with the present case of the same name. 394 A. The standing issues presented by the individual plaintiffs are not novel. The Supreme Court faced a similar situation when it decided NFIB in 2012. At oral argument in that case, Justice Kagan asked Greg- ory Katsas, representing NFIB, whether he thought \"a person who is subject to th e [individual] mandate but not subject to the [shared responsibility payment] would have standing.\" Transcript of Oral Argument at 68, Dep't of Health & Human Servs. v. Florida , 567 U.S. 519 (2012) (No. 11-398). Mr. Katsas replied, \"Yes, I think that person would, because that person is in-jured by compliance with the mandate.\" Id. Mr. Katsas explained, \"the injury\u2014when that person is subject to the mandate, that person is required to purchase health insurance. That's a forced acquisition of an unwanted good. It's a classic pocketbook injury.\" Id. at 68-69. In 2012, this questioning made sense because nei- ther the individual mandate nor the shared responsi- bility payment would be assessed for another two years. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, \u00a7 1501, 124 Stat. 119, 244 (2012) (requiring insurance coverage \"for each month begin-ning after 2013\" and applying the shared responsibil-ity payment for any failure to purchase insurance \"during any calendar year beginning after 2013\"). It was thus certainly imminent that the private plain- tiffs would be subject to the individual mandate, which applies to everyone, but not certain that they would be subject to the shared responsibility payment, which exempts certain people. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(e) (pre- scribing that \"[n]o penalty shall be imposed\" on certain 395 groups of people).21 The distinction was important be- cause a plaintiff \"must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press.\" Davis v. Fed. Election Comm'n , 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008) (quoting Daim- lerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno , 547 U.S. 332, 352 (2006)). To bring a claim against the individual mandate, therefore, the plaintiffs needed to show injury from the individual mandate \u2014not from the shared responsibil- ity payment. Accordingly, the district court in NFIB ruled that the private plaintiffs were injured by the ACA \"be- cause of the financial expense [they would] definitively incur under the Act in 2014,\" and the private plain-tiffs' need \"to take investigatory steps and make finan- cial arrangements now to ensure compliance then.\" Florida ex rel. Bondi v. U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 780 F. Supp. 2d 1256, 1271 (N.D. Fla. 2011), rev'd in part , 648 F.3d 1235 (11th Cir. 2011), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 567 U.S. 519 (2012). The record evidence in that case supported this conclusion. Mary Brown, one of the private plain- tiffs in that case, for example, had declared that \"to comply with the individual insurance mandate, and well in advance of 2014, I must now investigate whether and how to rearrange my personal finance af-fairs.\" Appendix of Exhibits in Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment, Florida v. U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs. , No. 3:10-cv-91-RV/EMT (N.D. Fla. Nov. 10, 2010), ECF No. 80-6. At the Elev- enth Circuit, all parties agreed that Mary Brown had standing. Florida ex rel. Att'y. Ge n. v. U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs. , 648 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th 21 For the full list of exemptions, see supra note 4. 396 Cir. 2011), aff'd in part and rev'd in part , 567 U.S. 519 (2012) (\"Defendants do not dispute that plaintiff Brown's challenge to the minimum coverage provision is justiciable.\"). Congress could have reasonably con-templated people like Mary Br own. As Mr. Katsas ex- plained at oral argument in the Supreme Court, \"Congress reasonably could th ink that at least some people will follow the law precisely because it is the law.\" Transcript of Oral Argument at 67, Dep't of Health & Human Servs. v. Florida , 567 U.S. 519 (2012) (No. 11-398). The district court in the instant case followed a similar approach with regard to the individual plain- tiffs' standing. 22 It concluded that because the indi- vidual plaintiffs are the object of the individual mandate, which requires them to purchase health in-surance that they do not want, those plaintiffs have demonstrated two types of \"injury in fact\": (1) the fi- nancial injury of buying th at insurance; and (2) the \"increased regulatory burden\" that the individual mandate imposes. In concluding that these injuries were caused by the individual mandate, the court made specific fact findings that both Nantz and Hur- ley purchased insurance solely because they are \"obli- gated to comply with the . . . individual mandate.\" The district court made these findings based on Nantz's and Hurley's declarations, which the intervenor-de- fendant states never challenged. Because the undis-puted evidence showed that the individual mandate caused these injuries, the district court reasoned that 22 No party initially questioned the plaintiffs' standing in the dis- trict court. An amicus brief rais ed the issue, and the intervenor- defendant states addressed it at oral argument. 397 a favorable judgment would redress both injuries, al- lowing the individual plaintiffs to forgo purchasing health insurance and freeing them \"from what they es- sentially allege to be arbitrary governance.\" We agree with the district court. The Supreme Court has held that when a lawsuit challenges \"the le-gality of government action or inaction, the nature and extent of facts that must be averred (at the summary judgment stage) or proved (at the trial stage) in order to establish standing depends considerably upon whether\" the plaintiffs are th emselves the \"object[s] of the action (or forgone action) at issue.\" Lujan , 504 U.S. at 561; see also Texas v. EEOC , 933 F.3d 433, 446 (5th Cir. 2019). \"Whether someone is in fact an object of a regulation is a flexible inquiry rooted in common sense.\" EEOC , 933 F.3d at 446 (quoting Con- tender Farms, L.L.P. v. U.S. Dep't of Agric. , 779 F.3d 258, 265 (5th Cir. 2015)). If a plaintiff is indeed the object of a regulation, \"there is ordinarily little ques-tion that the action or inaction has caused [the plain- tiff] injury, and that a judgment preventing or requiring the action will redress it.\" Lujan , 504 U.S. at 561-62. It is undisputed that Hurley and Nantz are the ob- jects of the individual mandate and that they have purchased insurance in order to comply with that man- date. Record evidence suppo rts these conclusions. In his declaration in the district court, Nantz stated, \"I continue to maintain minimum essential health cover- age because I am obligated.\" Similarly, Hurley averred in his declaration that he is \"obligated to com-ply with the ACA's individual mandate.\" They both explain in their declarations that they \"value compli- 398 ance with ance because they \"believe that following the law is the right thing to do.\" Accordingly, the district court ex- pressly found that Hurley and Nantz bought health insurance because they are obligated to, and we must defer to that factual finding. The evidentiary basis for this injury is even st ronger than it was in NFIB. In the instant case, the individual mandate has already gone into effect, compelling Nantz and Hurley to pur- chase insurance now as opposed to two years in the future. The intervenor-defendant states fail to point to any evidence contradicting these declarations, and they did not challenge this evidence in the district court. In fact, some of the evidence these parties rely on actu- ally supports the conclusion that Nantz and Hurley purchased insurance to comply with the individual mandate. The intervenor-defendant states acknowledge a 2017 report from the Congressional Budget Office indicating that \"a small number of peo- ple\" would continue to buy insurance without a pen- alty \"solely because\" of a desire to comply with the law. Cong. Budget Office, Repealing the Individual Health Insurance Mandate: An Updated Estimate 1 (Nov. 2017). This report is at least somewhat consistent with a 2008 Congressional Budget Office report, relied on by the state plaintiffs, that \"[m]any individuals\" subject to the mandate, bu t not the shared responsi- bility payment, will obtain coverage to comply with the mandate \"because they believe in abiding by the na-tion's laws.\" Cong. Budget Office, Key Issues in Ana- lyzing Major Health Insurance Proposals 53 (Dec. 2008). Whether this group of law-abiding citizens in- 399 cludes of peo- ple,\" Nantz and Hurley have undisputed evidence showing that they are a part of this group. In this context, being required to buy something that you otherwise would not want is clearly within the scope of what counts as a \"legally cognizable in- jury.\" \"Economic injury\" of this sort quintessen- tial injury upon which to base standing.\" Tex. Democratic Party v. Benkiser , 459 F.3d 582, 586 (5th Cir. 2006); see also Vt. Agency of Nat. Res. v. United States, 529 U.S. 765, 772-77 (1998) (finding Article III injury from financial harm); Clinton v. New York , 524 U.S. 417, 432 (1998) (same); Sierra Club v. Morton , 405 U.S. 727, 733-34 (1972) (same); DAPA , 809 F.3d at 155 (same). In Benkiser , for example, we held that a political party would suffer an injury in fact because it would need to \"expend additional funds\" in order to comply with the challenged regulation. 459 F.3d at 586. In the instant case, the undisputed record evi-dence shows that the individual plaintiffs have spent \"additional funds\" to comply with the statutory provi- sion that they challenge on constitutional grounds. This injury, moreover, is \"actual,\" not merely a speculative fear about future harm that may or may not happen. Lujan , 504 U.S. at 560. The record shows that, at the time of the complaint, Hurley and Nantz held health insurance, spending money every month that they did not want to spend. Nantz reports that his monthly premium is $266.56, and Hurley says his is $1,081.70. The injury is also \"concrete\" because it involves the real expend iture of those funds. See Bar- low v. Collins , 397 U.S. 159, 162-63, 164 (1970) (find- ing a concrete injury when a regulation caused economic harm from lost profit). 400 Causation and redressability \"flow naturally\" from this concrete, particularized injury. Contender Farms , 779 F.3d at 266. The evidence in the record from Hur- ley's and Nantz's declaratio ns show that they would not have purchased health insurance but for the indi- vidual mandate, and the intervenor-defendant states have no evidence to the contrary. A judgment declar-ing that the individual mandate exceeds Congress' powers under the Constitution would allow Hurley and Nantz to forgo the purchase of health insurance that they do not want or need. They could purchase health insurance below the \"minimum essential cover- age\" threshold, or even decide not to purchase any health insurance at all. The intervenor-defendant states make several ar- guments against this straightforward injury, and all of them come up short. They first argue that there is no legally cognizable injury because there is no longer any penalty for failing to comply. In one sense, this argument misses the point. The threat of a penalty that Hurley and Nantz would face under the pre-2017 version of the statute is one potential form of injury, but it is far from the only one. We have held that the costs of compliance can constitute an injury just as much as the injuries from failing to comply. See, e.g., Benkiser, 459 F.3d at 586. Thus, in this instance, it is this injury\u2014the time and money spent complying with the statute, not the penalt y for failing to do so\u2014that constitutes the plaintiffs' injury. But the intervenor-defendant states also argue that even the costs of co mpliance cannot count as an injury in fact if there is no consequence for failing to comply. The individual mandate's compulsion cannot inflict a cognizable injury, they say, because it is not a 401 compulsion at all. Because the enforcement mecha- nism has been removed, the U.S. House contends, it is now merely a suggestion, at most. We recently re-jected this argument in Texas v. EEOC , when the Equal Employment Opportuni ty Commission tried to argue that Texas could not challenge its allegedly non-final administrative guidance because \"the Guidance does not compel Texas to do anything.\" 933 F.3d at 448. We concluded that it would \"strain credulity to find that an agency action targeting current 'unlawful' discrimination among state employers\u2014and declaring presumptively unlawful the very hiring practices em- ployed by state agencies\u2014does not require action im-mediately enough to constitute an injury-in-fact.\" 23 Id. The individual mandate is no different. Just like the agency guidance, the individual mandate targets as \"unlawful\" the decision to go without health insur- ance. The dissenting opinion grounds its discussion of the issue in the Supreme Court's decision in Poe v. Ullman , 367 U.S. 497 (1961). There, the Supreme Court re- 23 The dissenting opinion states that Texas had standing in Texas v. EEOC because of the \"consequences for disobeying the [chal- lenged] guidance\u2014including the possibility that the Attorney General would enforce Title VII against it.\" This depiction of Texas v. EEOC ignores that opinion's emphasis on the fact that Texas was \"the object of the Guidance.\" 933 F.3d at 446; see also id. (\"If, in a suit 'challenging the legality of government action,' 'the plaintiff is himself an object of the action . . . there is ordinar-ily little question that the action or inaction has caused him injury . . . .'\" (quoting Lujan , 504 U.S. at 561-62)). As explained above, the individual plaintiffs in this case are the objects of the individ-ual mandate. 402 jected a challenge to Connecticut's criminal prohibi- tion on contraception. The dissenting opinion states that if there was no standing in Ullman , then there cannot be standing here. The dissenting opinion seems to treat Ullman as part of the \"pre-enforcement challenge\" line of cases in which the Supreme Court analyzed claims of injury based on future enforcement to determine whether the future enforcement was suf- ficiently imminent. Ullman , however, is not cited in the seminal Supreme Court cases of that line. See, e.g. , Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158-61 (2014); Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project , 561 U.S. 1, 15 (2010); Virginia v. Am. Booksellers Ass'n, Inc., 484 U.S. 383, 392-93 (1988); Babbitt Workers Nat'l Union , 442 U.S. 289, 298 (1979); see also Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 154 (1967). More importantly, as we have explained, this case is not a pre-enforcement challenge because the plaintiffs have already incurred a financial injury. 24 24 The dissenting opinion also relies on City of Austin v. Paxton , No. 18-50646, ___ F.3d ____, 2019 WL 6520769 (5th Cir. Dec. 4, 2019). That reliance is confusing because City of Austin is an Ex parte Young case, not a standing case. For the Ex parte Young exception to Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity to apply, the state official sued \"must have 'some connection with enforce-ment of the challenged act.'\" Id. at *2 (alteration omitted) (quot- ing Ex parte Young , 209 U.S. 123, 157 (1908)). In City of Austin , the City's claims against the Texas Attorney General failed be-cause the City failed to show the requisite connection to enforce-ment under Ex parte Young . Of course, because this is a lawsuit against the federal government, neither the Eleventh Amend-ment nor Ex parte Young applies. Moreover, even if City of Aus- tin had been a pre-enforcement challenge standing case, it would still be irrelevant because this case is not a pre-enforcement chal-lenge. 403 The plurality opinion in Ullman said there was in- sufficient adversity between the parties because there was overwhelming evidence\u2014eighty years' worth of no enforcement of the statute\u2014of \"tacit agreement\" be-tween prosecutors and the public not to enforce the anti-contraceptive laws that the plaintiffs challenged. 367 U.S. at 507-08. As a resu lt, the Court held that the lawsuit before it was \"n ot such an adversary case as will be reviewed here.\" Id. The fifth, controlling vote in that case\u2014Justice Brennan, who concurred in the judgment\u2014emphasized that this adverseness was lacking because of the case's \"skimpy record,\" devoid of evidence that the \"individuals [were] truly caught in an inescapable dilemma.\" Id. at 509 (Brennan, J., con- curring). By contrast, as documented above, the record in the instant case contains undisputed evidence that Nantz and Hurley feel compelled by the individual mandate to buy insurance and that they bought insurance solely for that reason. Especially in light of the fact that the individual mandate lacks a similar eighty- year history of nonenforcement, Nantz and Hurley have gone much further in demonstrating that they are caught in the \"inescapable dilemma\" that the Ullman plaintiffs were not. The intervenor-defendant states also argue that there is no causation between the individual mandate and Hurley and Nantz's purchase of insurance be-cause Hurley and Nantz exercised a voluntary \"choice\" to purchase insurance. Because Nantz and Hurley would face no consequence if they went without insur- ance, the intervenor-defendant states argue that their purchase of insurance is not fairly traceable to the fed- eral defendants. Instead, they claim that Nantz and 404 Hurley impermissibly attempt to \"manufacture stand- ing merely by inflicting harm on themselves.\" Glass v. Paxton , 900 F.3d 233, 239 (5th Cir. 2018) (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA , 568 U.S. 398, 416 (2013)). This argument fails, howe ver, because it conflates the merits of the case with the threshold inquiry of standing. The argument assumes that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A presents not a lega l command to purchase in- surance, but an option between purchasing insurance and doing nothing. Because this option exists, the ar- gument goes, any injury arising from Hurley's and Nantz's decisions to buy insurance instead of doing nothing (the other putative option) is entirely self-in- flicted. This, however, is a merits question that can be reached only after determining the threshold issue of whether plaintiffs have standing. Texas v. EEOC makes clear that courts cannot fuse the standing inquiry into the merits in this way. There, in addition to the injury described above from the Guidance's rebuke of Texas's employment prac-tices as \"unlawful,\" Texas claimed it was injured by the EEOC's curtailing of Texas's procedural right to notice and comment before being subject to a regula- tion. EEOC , 933 F.3d at 447. In rejecting the sugges- tion that Texas was not truly injured because the EEOC had not in fact violated the Administrative Pro- cedure Act's notice-and-comment rules, we held that \"[w]e assume, for purposes of the standing analysis, that Texas is correct on the merits of its claim that the Guidance was promulgated in violation of the APA.\" Id. (citing Sierra Club v. EPA , 699 F.3d 530, 533 (D.C. Cir. 2012)); see also Bennett v. Spear , 520 U.S. 154, 405 177-78 (1997) (treating constitu tional standing and fi- nality as distinct inquiries). Indeed, allowing a consider ation of the merits as part of a jurisdictional inquiry would conflict with the Supreme Court's express decision in Steel Co. v. Citi- zens for a Better Environment to not abandon \"two cen- turies of jurisprudence affirming the necessity of determining jurisdiction before proceeding to the mer- its.\" 523 U.S. 83, 98 (1998). That case presented both the question of Article III standing and the merits question of whether the relevant statute authorized lawsuits for purely past violations. Id. at 86. The Court rejected any \"attempt to convert the merits issue . . . into a jurisdictional one.\" Id. at 93. The Court fur- ther rejected the \"doctrine of hypothetical jurisdic-tion,\" under which certain courts of appeals had \"proceed[ed] immediately to the merits question, de- spite jurisdictional objections\" in certain circum- stances. Id. at 93-94. As the dist rict court correctly noted, that is exactly what the appellants ask this court to do. They urge us to \"skip ahead to the merits to determine \u00a7 5000A(a) is non-binding and therefore constitutional and then revert to the standing analysis to use its merits determination to conclude there was no standing to reach the merits in the first place.\" Moreover, even if we were to consider the merits as part of our jurisdictional inquiry, it would not make a difference in this case. Because we conclude in Part IV of this opinion that the individual mandate is best read as a command to purchase insurance (and an unconstitutional one at that), rather than as an option 406 between buying insurance or doing nothing, the indi- vidual plaintiffs would have standing even if we con- sidered the merits.25 B. We next consider whether the eighteen state plain- tiffs have standing, and we conclude that they do.26 The state plaintiffs allege that the ACA causes them both a fiscal injury as employers and a sovereign in- jury \"because it prevents them from applying their own laws and policies governing their own healthcare markets.\" State Plaint iffs' Br. at 25. In DAPA , we de- termined that the state of Texas was entitled to spe-cial solicitude because it wa s \"exercising a procedural right created by Congress an d protecting a 'quasi-sov- ereign' interest.\" DAPA , EPA , 549 U.S. 497, 520 (2007)); see also id. at 154-55. Because the state plaintiffs in this case have suffered fiscal injuries as employers, we need not address special solicitude or the alleged sovereign in-juries. 25 Even if the individual plaintiffs did not have standing, this case could still proceed because the state plaintiffs have standing. DAPA , 809 F.3d at 151 (holding that only one plaintiff needs standing for the court to exercise jurisdiction). \"This circuit fol- lows the rule that alternative holdings are binding precedent and not obiter dictum.\" Id. at 178 n.158 (quoting United States v. Potts , 644 F.3d 233, 237 n.3 (5th Cir. 2011)). 26 Likewise, even if the state plaintiffs did not have standing, this case could still proceed because the individual plaintiffs have standing. DAPA , 809 F.3d at 151 (holding that only one plaintiff needs standing for the court to exercise jurisdiction). 407 Employers, including the state plaintiffs, are re- quired by the ACA to issue forms verifying which em- ployees are covered by minimum essential coverage and therefore do not need to pay the shared responsi- bility payment. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6055(a) (\"Every person who provides minimum essential coverage to an indi-vidual during a calendar year shall, at such time as the Secretary may prescribe, make a return de- scribed in subsection (b ).\"); requirements] shall . . . make a return de-scribed in subsection (b).\"). These provisions have led to Form 1095-B and 1095-C statements that employ- ees receive from their employers around tax time, which include a series of check boxes indicating the months that employees had health coverage that com-plies with the ACA. State Pl aintiffs' Br. at 23. These legally required reporting practices exist on top of state employers' own in-house administrative systems for managing and tracking their employees' health in- surance coverage. The record is replete with evidence that the indi- vidual mandate itself has increased the cost of print-ing and processing these forms and of updating the state employers' in-house management systems. For example, Thomas Steckel, th e director of the Division of Employee Benefits within the South Dakota Bureau of Human Resources, submitted a declaration docu-menting the administrative costs that the individual mandate has imposed by way of these reporting re- quirements. He said, \"[t]he individual mandate caused significant administrative burdens and ex- penses to program our IT sy stem to track and report ACA eligible employees and complete mandatory IRS 408 Form 1095 annual reports.\" St eckel noted specifically $100,000.00 [in] ongoing for Form 1095-C alone. The dissenting opinion discards this evidence as conclusory. But as even counsel for the intervenor- defendant states admitted at oral argument, nobody challenged this evidence as conclusory in the district court or in the appellate court. 27 Oral Argument at 5:12. 27 The reason why is obvious: the evidence is not conclusory. This is bread-and-butter summary judgment practice, not, as the dis- senting opinion contends, any \"new summary-judgment rule.\" Of course, a properly-included affida vit must be based on personal knowledge, and conclusory facts and statements on information and belief cannot be utilized. See Charles Alan Wright and Ar- thur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 2738 (4th ed. 2019). The Steckel affidavit easily satisfies this standard: it is a detailed 8-page declaration. Steckel attested, under penalty of perjury, that he is \"responsible for developing and implementing the State's health plan for state employees\" and that he is \"par-ticularly familiar with changes in costs, plans, and policies re- lated to the enactment of the ACA because of my role as the Director of the Division [of Employee Benefits].\" He estimates the financial costs the individual mandate has caused in nine dif-ferent categories, including ongoing costs of $10,400 for review of denied appeals, ongoing costs of $100,000 for Form 1095-C ad-ministration, and a one-time cost of $3,302,942 as a Transitional Reinsurance Program fee. For other costs, such as the pre-exist-ing conditions prohibition and th e expanded eligibility for adult dependent children to age 26, he conceded that he was \"unable to accurately estimate the ongoing costs of this mandate.\" A deter-mination of standing is supported by the administration of Form 1095-C, the CBO's prediction that some individuals will continue to purchase insurance in the absence of a shared respon-sibility payment, the fact that two such individuals are before 409 South Dakota is far from the only state that has been harmed from the financial cost of the reporting requirements that the individual mandate aggra- vates. Judith Muck, the Executive Director of the Mis-souri Consolidated Health Care Plan, reported that Missouri's costs for preparing 1095-B forms, along with 1094-B forms, are projected to be $47,300 in fiscal year 2019 and $49,200 in fiscal year 2020. Similarly, Teresa MacCartney, the Chief Financial Officer of the State of Georgia and the Dire ctor of the Georgia Gover- nor's Office of Planning and Budget, reported that Georgia's overall cost of compliance with the ACA's re- porting requirements \"is an estimated net $3.6 million to date.\" MacCartney also reported that after the ACA's implementation, Georgia's Department of Com- munity Health \"experienced increased enrollment of individuals already eligible for Medicaid benefits un- der pre-ACA eligibility stan dards.\" This enrollment increase required the Department to enhance its man- agement systems, which was \"very costly.\" Blaise Du- ran, who is the Manager for Underwriting, Data Analysis and Reporting for the Employees Retirement System of Texas, further documented Texas' costs of the reporting requirements. He declared that the Texas Employees Group Benefits Program \"has made administrative process changes in connection with its ACA compliance, such as those related to the provision this court, and the Supreme Court's observation that \"third par- ties will likely react in predictable ways.\" Department of Com- merce , 139 S. Ct. at 2566. 410 of Form 1095-Bs to plan participants and the Internal Revenue Service.\"28 The intervenor-defendant states and the U.S. House have not challenged the state plaintiffs' evi-dence or presented any evidence to the contrary. In- stead, they argue that the reporting requirements set forth in Sections 6055(a) and 6056(a) \"are separate from the mandate and serve independent purposes.\" U.S. House Reply Br. at 19. Therefore, they claim, \"any resulting injury is thus neither traceable to Sec- tion 5000A nor redressable by its invalidation.\" U.S. House Reply Br. at 19. But this misreads the undis-puted evidence in the record. The individual mandate commands individuals to get insurance. Every time an individual gets that insurance through a state em- ployer, the state employer must send the individual a form certifying that he or she is covered and otherwise process that information through in-house manage- ment systems. 29 Thus, the reporting requirements in 28 This list is not exhaustive. For instance, Arlene Larson, Man- ager of Federal Health Programs and Policy for Wisconsin Em- ployee Trust Funds, declared that the state expended funds by \"hir[ing] a vendor to issue 343 Form 1095-Cs\" in 2017. And Mike Michael, Director of the Kansas State Employee Health Plan, averred that reporting for Form 1094 and 1095 cost the state $43,138 in 2017 and $38,048 in 2018. No record evidence indi-cates that these reporting requirements have been eliminated. Moreover, the \"standing inquiry remains focused on whether the party invoking jurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit was filed.\" Davis v. Fed. Election Comm'n , 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008). 29 Relying on this injury, therefore, does not run afoul of Nat'l Fed'n of the Blind of Texas v. Abbott , 647 F.3d 202 (5th Cir. 2011). 411 Sections 6055(a) and 6056(a) flow from th e individual mandate set forth in Section 5000A(a). These costs to the state plaintiffs are well-estab- lished.30 Moreover, the continuing nature of these fis- cal injuries is consistent with Fifth Circuit and Supreme Court precedent. That case prevents plaintiffs from claiming injury based on pro- visions whose enforcement would be enjoined only if they are in-severable from an unconstitutional provision that does not harm the plaintiff. Id. at 210-11. The state plaintiffs' injuries stem from the increased administrative costs created by the individual mandate itself, not from other provisions. To be sure, those costs are created in part by the individual mandate's practical interac-tion with other ACA provisions, like the reporting requirements. But this is no different from the injuries in DAPA , where the chal- lenged action interacted with Texas's driver's license regulations. It is also no different from Department of Commerce , where the challenged census question intera cted with constitutional rules tying political representation to a state's population. 30 The dissenting opinion, citing no authority, contends that the state plaintiffs need evidence that at least one specific \"employee enrolled in one of state plaintiffs' health insurance programs solely because of the unenforceable coverage requirement.\" We have already explained why the uncontested affidavits suffice. We note, moreover, that the DAPA court found that Texas had standing because \"it would incu r significant costs in issuing driver's licenses to DAPA beneficiaries\"\u2014without requiring that Texas first show that it had issued a specific license to a specific illegal alien because of DAPA. Finally, the dissenting opinion's rule would create a split with our sister circuits. See Massachu- setts v. United States Dep't of Health & Human Servs. , 923 F.3d 209, 225 (1st Cir. 2019) (\"[Massachusetts] need not point to a spe-cific person who will be harmed in order to establish standing in situations like this.\"); California v. Azar , 911 F.3d 558, 572 (9th Cir. 2018), cert. denied sub nom. Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence v. California , 139 S. Ct. 2716 (2019) (\"Appellants 412 In DAPA , we held that the state of Texas had standing to challenge the federal government's DAPA program because it stood to \"have a major effect on the states' fisc.\" 809 F.3d at 152. This was because, if DAPA were permitted to go into effect, it would have \"enable[d] at least 500,000 illegal aliens in Texas\" to satisfy Texas's requirements that the Department of Public Safety \"'shall issue' a license to a qualified ap- plicant,\" including noncitizens who present \"documen-tation issued by the appropriate United States agency that authorizes the applicant to be in the United States.\" Id. at 155 (quoting Tex. Transp. Code \u00a7\u00a7 521.142(a), 521.181). Evidence in the record showed that Texas, which subsidizes its licenses, would \"lose a minimum of $130.89 on each one it issued to a DAPA beneficiary.\" Id. Even a \"modest estimate\" of predict- able third-party behavior would rack up costs of \"sev- eral million dollars.\" Id. The Supreme Court recently applied a similar anal- ysis in Department of Commerce v. New York , 139 S. Ct. 2551 (2019). In that case, a group of state and local governments sued to prevent the federal government from including a question about citizenship status on the 2020 census. Id. at 2563. The Supreme Court held that these plaintiffs had standing because they met their burden \"of showing that third parties will likely fault the states for failing to identify a specific woman likely to lose coverage. Such identification is not necessary to establish standing.\"); Pennsylvania v. President United States , 930 F.3d 543, 564 (3d Cir. 2019), as amended (July 18, 2019) (\"The Govern- ment faults the States for failing to identify a specific woman who will be affected by the Final Rules, but the States need not define injury with such a demanding level of particularity to establish standing.\"). 413 react in predictable ways to the citizenship question.\" Id. at 2566. The census question would likely lead to \"noncitizen households responding . . . at lower rates than other groups, which in turn would cause them to be undercounted.\" Id. at 2565. This undercounting of third parties would injure the state and local govern-ments by \"diminishment of political representation, loss of federal funds, degradation of census data, and diversion of resources.\" Id. In both DAPA and Department of Commerce , the state plaintiffs demonstrated injury by showing that the challenged law would cause third parties to behave in predictable ways, which would inflict a financial in-jury on the states. The instant case is no different. The individual mandate commands people to ensure that they have minimum health insurance coverage. That predictably causes more people to buy insurance, which increases the administrative costs of the states to report, manage, and track the insurance coverage of their employees and Medicaid recipients. 31 31 The dissenting opinion contends that our opinion is incon- sistent because we rely on Department of Commerce , in which the Court found that some individuals will predictably violate the law, in explaining why some individuals will predictably \"follow the law regardless of the incentives.\" In a large group, there will predictably be some individuals in each category. Even the dis-senting opinion accepts the Congressional Budget Office's projec-tion that some people will buy insurance solely because of a desire to comply with the law. See Cong. Budget Office, Repealing the Individual Health Insurance Mandate: An Updated Estimate 1 (Nov. 2017). 414 V. Having concluded that both groups of plaintiffs have standing to bring this lawsuit, we must next de- termine whether the individual mandate is a constitu-tional exercise of congressional power. We conclude that it is not. We first discuss the Supreme Court's holding in NFIB, and then we explain why, under that holding, the individual mandate is no longer constitu- tional. A. The NFIB opinion was extremely fractured. In that case, Chief Justice Roberts wrote an opinion ad- dressing several issues. Parts of that opinion gar- nered a majority of votes and served as the opinion of the Court. 32 In relevant part, Part III-A of the Chief Justice's opinion, joined by no other Justice, observed 32 As a general overview, Chief Justice Roberts's opinion func- tioned in the following way. In Part III-A, Chief Justice Roberts said that the individual mandate was most naturally read as a command to buy insurance, which could not be sustained under either the Interstate Commerce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause. Though no Justice joined this part of the opinion, the four dissenting Justices\u2014Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito\u2014agreed with Part III-A in a separate opinion. In Part III-B, the Chief Justice wrote that even though the most natural reading of the individual mandate was unconstitutional, the Court still needed to determine whether it was \"fairly possible\" to read the provision in a way that saved it from being unconsti-tutional. In Part III-C, the Chief Justice\u2014joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor\u2014concluded that the provision could be construed as constitutional by reading the in-dividual mandate, in conjunction with the shared responsibility payment, as a legitimate exercise of Congress' taxing power. This last part of the opinion supported the Court's ultimate judgment: that the individual mandate was constitutional as saved. 415 that \"[t]he most straightforward reading of the [indi- vidual] mandate is that it commands individuals to purchase insurance,\" and that, using that reading of the statute, the individual mandate is not a valid exer-cise of Congress' power under the Interstate Com- merce Clause. NFIB , 567 U.S. at 562, 546-61 (Roberts, C.J.). The Consti tution, he explained, \"gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to com- pel it.\" Id. at 555 (Roberts, C.J.). For similar reasons, the Chief Justice concluded that this command to pur- chase insurance could not be sustained under the Con- stitution's Necessary and Proper Clause. Id. The individual mandate was not \"proper\" because it ex- panded federal power, \"vest[ ing] Congress with the ex- traordinary ability to create the necessary predicate to the exercise of\" its Interstate Commerce Clause pow-ers. Id. at 560. Though no other Justices joined this part of the Chief Justice's opinion, the \"joint dissent\"\u2014joined by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito\u2014 reached the same conclusions on the Interstate Com- merce Clause and Necessary and Proper Clause ques-tions. Id. at 650-60 (joint dissent). A majority of the court, therefore, concluded that the individual man-date is not constitutional under either the Interstate Commerce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause. This limited reading of the Interstate Commerce Clause\u2014and, by extension, of the Necessary and Proper Clause\u2014was necessary to preserving \"the country [that] the Framers of our Constitution envi-sioned.\" Id. at 554 (Roberts, C.J.). As Chief Justice Roberts observed, if the individual mandate were a 416 proper use of the power to regulate interstate com- merce, that power would \"justify a mandatory pur- chase to solve almost any problem.\" Id. at 553 (Roberts, C.J.). If Cong ress can compel the purchase of health insurance today, it can, for example, mi-cromanage Americans' day-to-day nutrition choices to- morrow. Id. (Roberts, C.J.); see also id. at 558 (Roberts, C.J.) (reasoning that, under an expansive view of the Commerce Clause, nothing would stop the federal gov-ernment from compelling the purchase of broccoli). An expansive reading of the Interstate Commerce Clause would be foreign to the Framers, who saw the clause as \"an addition which few oppose[d] and from which no apprehensions [were] entertained.\" Id. at 554 (Roberts, C.J.) (quoting The Federalist No. 45, at 293 (J. Madison) (C. Rossiter ed., 1961)). Elevating Congress' power \"regulate commerce . . . among the several states,\" U.S. Const. ar t. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3, to a power to create commerce among the several states would make a Leviathan of the federal government, \"every-where extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.\" NFIB, 567 U.S. at 554 (Roberts, C.J.) (quoting The Federalist No. 48, at 309 (J. Madison) (C. Rossiter ed., 1961)). The joint dissenters similarly noted that the more expansive reading of the Interstate Commerce Clause would ren- der that provision a \"font of unlimited power,\" id. at 653 (joint dissent), or, in the words of Alexander Ham- a \"hideous monster whose devouring jaws . . . spare neither sex nor age, nor high nor low, nor sacred nor profane,\" id. (quoting The Federalist No. 33, at 202 (C. Rossiter ed., 1961)). 417 In Part III-B, again joined by no other Justice, Chief Justice Roberts concluded that because the indi- vidual mandate found no constitutional footing in the Interstate Commerce or Necessary and Proper Clauses, the Supreme Court was obligated to consider the federal government's argument that, as an exercise in constitutional avoidance, the mandate could be read not as a command but as an option to purchase insur- ance or pay a tax. This \"option\" interpretation of the statute could save the statute from being unconstitu-tional, as it would be justified under Congress' taxing power. Id. at 561-63 (Roberts, C.J.); see also id. at 562 (Roberts, C.J.) (\"No court ou ght, unless the terms of an act rendered it unavoidable, to give a construction to it which should involve a violation, however uninten- tional, of the constitution.\" (quoting Parsons v. Bed- ford, 28 U.S. (3 Pet.) 433, 448-49 (1830))); see also id. at 563 (Roberts, C.J.) (\"The question is not whether that is the most natural interpretation of the mandate, but only whether it is a 'fairly possible' one.\" (quoting Crowell v. Benson , 285 U.S. 22, 62 (1932))). In Part III-C, the Chief Justice\u2014writing for a ma- jority of the Court, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan\u2014undertook that in- quiry of determining whethe r it was \"fairly possible\" to read the individual mandate as an option and thereby save its constitutionality. See id. at 563-74 (majority opinion). Chief Justice Roberts reasoned that the individual mandate could be read in conjunc- tion with the shared responsibility payment in order to save the individual mandate from unconstitutional-ity. Read together with the shared responsibility pay- ment, the entire statutory provision could be read as a 418 legitimate exercise of Cong ress' taxing power for four reasons. First and most fundamentally, the shared-respon- sibility payment \"yield[ed] the essential feature of any tax: It produce[d] at least some revenue for the Gov- ernment.\" Id. at 564. Second, the shared-responsibil- ity payment was \"paid into the Treasury by taxpayers when they file their tax returns.\" Id. at 563 (alterna- tions and internal quotation marks omitted). Third, the amount owed under the ACA was \"determined by such familiar factors as ta xable income, number of de- pendents, and joint filing status.\" Id. Fourth and fi- nally, \"[t]he requirement to pay [was] found in the Internal Revenue Code and enforced by the IRS, which . . . collect[ed] it in the same manner as taxes.\" Id. at 563-64 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because of these four attributes of the shared re- sponsibility payment, the Court reasoned that \"[t]he Federal Government does have the power to impose a tax on those without health insurance.\" Id. at 575. The Court concluded that \"[ s]ection 5000A is therefore constitutional, because it can reasonably be read as a tax.\" 33 Id. We agree with the dissenting opinion that \"this case begins and ought to end\" with NFIB. 33 Seven Justices\u2014Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, Breyer, Alito, and Kagan\u2014agreed that the Act's Medicaid-expansion provisions unconstitutionally coerced states into NFIB , U.S. at 575-85 (plurality opin- ion); id. at 671-89 (joint dissent). But, in light of a severability clause, Part IV-B of the Chief Ju stice's opinion concluded that the unconstitutional portion of the Medicaid provisions could be sev-ered. Id. at 585-88 (plurality opinion). Meanwhile, Justice Gins- burg, joined by Justice Sotomayor, disagreed that the Act's 419 B. Now that the shared responsibility payment amount is set at zero,34 the provision's saving con- struction is no longer available. The four central at- tributes that once saved th e statute because it could be read as a tax no longer exist. Most fundamentally, the provision no longer yields the \"essential feature of any tax\" because it does not produce \"at least some revenue for the Government.\" Id. at 564. Because the provision no longer produces revenue, it necessarily lacks the three other characteristics that once ren- dered the provision a tax. The shared-responsibility payment is no longer \"paid into the Treasury by tax-payer[s] when they file their tax returns\" because the payment is no longer paid by anyone. Id. at 563 (al- teration in original and internal quotation marks omitted). The payment amount is no longer \"deter- mined by such familiar factors as taxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing status.\" Id. The amount is zero for everyone, without regard to any of these factors. The IRS no longer collects the payment \"in the same manner as taxes\" because the IRS cannot mandatory Medicaid expansion was unconstitutional. Id. at 633 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in the judgment in part, and dissenting in part). Those two Justices concurred in the judgment with re-spect to the Chief Justice's conclusion that the unconstitutional provisions could be severed from the remainder of the Act. Id. at 645-46 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in the judgment in part, and dissenting in part). The four dissenting Justices concluded that the Act's Medicaid-expansion provisions were unconstitutionally coercive and rejected the relief of allowing states to opt into Med-icaid expansion. Id. at 671-90 (joint dissent). 34 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5000A(c)(2 )(B)(iii), (c)(3)(A). 420 collect it at all. Id. at 563-64 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because these four critical attributes are now miss- ing from the shared responsi bility payment, it is, in the words of the state plaint iffs, \"no longer 'fairly pos- sible' to save under Congress' taxing power.\" St ate Plaintiffs' Br. at 32. The proper application of NFIB to the new version of the statute is to interpret it according to what Chief Justice Roberts\u2014and four other Justices of the Court\u2014said was the \"most straightforward\" reading of that provision: a command to purchase insurance. Id. at 562 (Roberts, C.J.). As the district court properly observed, \"the only reading available is the most natural one.\" Under that reading, the individual mandate is unconstitutional because, under NFIB, it finds no constitutional footing in either the Interstate Commerce Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause. Id. at 546-61 (Roberts, C.J.); id. at 650-60 (joint dissent). The intervenor-defendant states have several ar- guments against this conclu sion, all of which fail. They first argue that the saving construction of the in- dividual mandate, interpreting the provision as an op- tion to buy insurance or pay a tax, is still \"fairly possible.\" As the individual plaintiffs point out, the Court interpreted the individual mandate as an option only because doing so would save it from being uncon-stitutional. Accordingly, the intervenor-defendant states must show that the \"option\" would still be a con- stitutional exercise of Cong ress' taxing power. To make that showing, the intervenor-defendant states reject the plaintiffs' attempt to read a \"some revenue\" requirement into the Constitution's Taxing and 421 Spending Clause, arguing instead for a potential-to- produce-revenue requirement. The individual man- date, they say, is still set out in the Internal Revenue Code. It still provides a \"statutory structure through which\" Congress could eventually tax people for failing to buy insurance. It still includes references to taxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing status. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5000A(b)(3), (c)(2), (c)(4). Further, it still does not apply to individuals who pay no federal in-come taxes. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(e)(2). The intervenor-defendant states have little sup- port for this reading of the Taxing and Spending Clause. For starters, NFIB could not be clearer that the \"produc[tion]\" of \"at least some revenue for the Government\"\u2014not the potential to produce that reve- nue\u2014is \"the essential feature of any tax.\" 567 U.S. at 564 (majority opinion) (emphasis added). As the dis- trict court observed, when determining whether a stat- ute is a tax, the actual production of revenue is \"not indicative, not common\u2014[but] essential.\" The intervenor-defendant states also find no sup- port in United States v. Ardoin , 19 F.3d 177, 179-80 (5th Cir. 1994). In that unusual case, Congress had imposed a tax on machine guns, but subsequently out- lawed machine guns altogether, which prompted the relevant agency to stop collecting the tax. Id. at 179- 80. The defendant was convicted not only for pos-sessing a machine gun but also for failing to pay the tax, which remained on the books. Id. at 178. The court upheld the conviction on the basis that the tax law at issue could \"be upheld on the preserved, but un-used, power to tax or on the power to regulate inter- state commerce.\" Id. at 180. But the taxing power was 422 \"preserved\" in Ardoin because it was non-revenue-pro- ducing only in practice whereas the \"tax\" here is actu- ally $0.00 as written on the books.35 See Fed. Defendants' Br. at 32. Expanding Ardoin to apply here would, as the federal defendants point out, puzz-lingly allow Congress to \"prohibit conduct that exceeds its commerce power through a two-step process of first taxing it and then eliminating the tax while retaining the prohibition.\" Fed. Defendants' Br. at 32. The intervenor-defendant states argue further that the individual mandate does not even need constitu-tional justification because it is merely a suggestion, not binding legislative action. The individual man-date, they contend, is no different from the Flag Code, which, though entered into the pages of the U.S. Code, \"was not intended to proscribe conduct.\" Dimmitt v. City of Clearwater , 985 Cir. 1993) (analyzing \u00a7\u00a7 174-76). This argu-ment is just a repackaged version of their argument that the individual mandate ca n still be read as an op- tion. But, as the state plai ntiffs, the individual plain- tiffs, and the federal defendants point out, the Supreme Court has already held that the \"most straightforward\" reading of the individual mandate\u2014 which emphatically demands that individuals \"shall\" buy insurance, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(a)\u2014is as a command 35 This distinction also disposes of the intervenor-defendant states' concern about \"cast[ing] constitutional doubt on taxes with delayed start dates or that Congress has temporarily sus-pended for periods of time.\" Intervenor-Defendant States' Br. at 43. In none of the examples the intervenor-defendant states cite did the statute purport to levy a \"tax\" of $0.00. 423 to purchase health insurance. The Court then con- cluded that that command lacked constitutional justi- fication. The zeroing out of the shared responsibility payment does not render the provision any less of a command. Quite the opposite: Chief Justice Roberts concluded that the greater-than-zero shared responsi- bility payment actually converted the individual man-date into an option. NFIB, 567 U.S. at 563-64 (majority opinion). Now that the shared responsibility payment has been zeroed out, the only logical conclu-sion under NFIB is to read the individual mandate as a command, quite unlike the Flag Code. It is an indi-vidual mandate , not an individual suggestion. Moreover, it is not true that when the Court adopts a limiting construction to avoid constitutional ques-tions, that construction controls as to all applications of the statute, regardless of whether the original con- stitutional implications are present. The case on which the U.S. House relies involved different appli- cations of an identical statute to different facts. Clark v. Martinez , 543 U.S. 371, 380 (2005) (rejecting the ar- gument that \"the constitutional concerns that influ-enced\" a previous interpretation of a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act were \"not present for\" the aliens at issue in that case). This case is read-ily distinguishable because the four characteristics that made the previous interpretation possible\u2014the production of revenue and other tax-like features\u2014have now been legislatively removed. The limiting construction is no longer available as a matter of stat- utory interpretation. The interpretation must accord-ingly change to comport with what five Justices of the 424 Supreme Court have said is the \"most straightforward reading\" of that interpretation.36 The dissenting opinion justifies its continued reli- ance on the saving construction\u2014even though it is no longer applicable\u2014by citing Kimble v. Marvel Entm't, LLC, 135 S. Ct. 2401 (2015). Th is approach fares no better. The dissenting opinion quotes Kimble to say that \"in whatever way reasoned,\" the Court's interpre- tation \"effectively . . . to congressional change.\" Id. at 2409. The dissenting opinion correctly acknowledges that the individual mandate was never changed. But what did change was the provision that actually mat-tered: the shared responsibility payment. When it was set above zero, it could be saved as a tax, even though five justices agr eed this was an unnatural reading. It would be puzzling if Congress could change a statute at will, entirely insulated from constitutional infirmity, just because the Court had previously used constitutional avoidance to save a previous version of the statute. 36 Contrary to the dissenting opinion's suggestion, a saving con- struction is no longer available. The canon of constitutional avoidance applies only \"when statutory language is susceptible of multiple interpretations.\" Jennings v. Rodriguez , 138 S. Ct. 830, 836 (2018). In NFIB , \u00a7 5000A was amenable to two possible in- terpretations. It was either \"a command to buy insurance\" or \"a tax.\" NFIB, 567 U.S. at 574 (Roberts, C.J.). After Congress ze- roed out the shared responsibility payment, one of those possible interpretations fell away. What was then the \"most straightfor-ward reading\" is now the only available reading: it is a \"command to buy insurance\" and \"the Commerce Clause does not authorize such a command.\" Id. 425 The intervenor-defendant states argue further- more that the individual mandate can now be consti- tutional under the Interstate Commerce Clause because it does not compel anyone into commerce. This is again a repackaged version of their argument that the individual mandate is an option even with- out a revenue-generating shared responsibility pay-ment, an argument that, as the state plaintiffs point out, the Supreme Court has already rejected. This ar- gument, as the district court observed, is also logically inconsistent. If the individual mandate no longer truly compels anything, then it can hardly be said to be a \"regulat[ion]\" of interstate commerce. In the words of the district court, the intervenor-defendant states \"hope to have their cake and eat it too.\" 37 Finally, we would be remiss if we did not engage with the dissenting opinion's contention that \u00a7 5000A is not an exercise of legislative power. This would likely come as a shock to the legislature that drafted it, the president who signed it, and the voters who cel- ebrated or lamented it. It is not surprising that the dissenting opinion can cite no case in which a federal court deems a duly enacted statute not an exercise of legislative power, much less a statute that clearly commands that an individual \"shall\" do something. 38 37 Any argument that the individual mandate can now be sus- tained under the Necessary and Proper Clause fails for the same reasons. The individual mandate now must be read as a com-mand, and five Justices in NFIB already rejected the argument that such a command could be sustained under the Necessary and Proper Clause. NFIB , 567 U.S. at 561 (Roberts, C.J.); id. at 654- 55 (joint dissent). 38 The dissenting opinion's theory of the \"law that does nothing\" 426 The dissenting opinion is inconsistent on this point: it argues that the provision's status as an exercise of leg- islative power fluctuates according to the amount of the shared responsibility payment while simultane-ously contending that \"if the text of the coverage re- quirement has not changed, its meaning could not have changed either.\" Our decision breaks no new ground. We simply observe that \u00a7 5000A was origi- nally cognizable as either a command or a tax. Today, it is only cognizable as a command. It has always been an exercise of legislative power. * * * In NFIB , the individual mandate\u2014most naturally read as a command to purchase insurance\u2014was saved from unconstitutionality because it could be read to- gether with the shared responsibility payment as an option to purchase insurance or pay a tax. It could be read this way because the shared responsibility pay- ment produced revenue. It no longer does so. There-fore, the most straightforward reading applies: the mandate is a command. Using that meaning, the in- dividual mandate is unconstitutional. results in some bizarre metaphysical conclusions. The ACA was signed into law in 2010. No one questions that when it was signed, \u00a7 5000A was an exercise of legislative power. Yet today, the dissenting opinion asserts, \u00a7 5000A is not an exercise of leg-islative power. So did Congress exercise legislative power in 2010, as seen from 2015? As s een from 2018? Does \u00a7 5000A on- tologically re-emerge should a future Congress restore the shared responsibility payment? Perhaps, like Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, \u00a7 5000A exists in both states simultaneously. The dissenting opinion does not say. Our approach requir es no such quantum musings. 427 VI. Having concluded that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, we must next determine whether, or how much of, the rest of the ACA is severable from that constitutional defect. On this question, we remand to the district court to undertake two tasks: to explain with more precision what provisions of the post-2017 ACA are indeed inseverable from the individual man- date; and to consider the federal defendants' newly- suggested relief of enjoining the enforcement only of those provisions that injure the plaintiffs or declaring the Act unconstitutional only as to the plaintiff states and the two individual plaintiffs. We address each is-sue in turn. A. The Supreme Court has said that the \"standard for determining the severability of an unconstitutional provision is well established.\" Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock , 480 U.S. 678, 684 (1987). Un less it is \"evident that the Legislature would not have enacted those pro-visions which are within its power, independently of that which is not, the invalid part may be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law.\" Id. (quoting Buckley v. Valeo , 424 U.S. 1, 108 (1976)). This inquiry into counterfactual Congressional in- tent has been crystallized 567 U.S. at 692 (joint dissent). First, if a court holds a statutory prov ision unconstitutional, it then determines whether the now-truncated statute will operate in \"a manner consistent with the intent of Congress.\" Alaska Airlines , 480 U.S. at 685 (emphasis omitted). This first step asks whether the constitu- tional provisions\u2014standing on their own, without the 428 unconstitutional provisions\u2014are \"fully operative as a law,\" not whether they would simply \"operate in some coherent way\" not designed by Congress. Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd. , 561 U.S. 477, 509 (2010) (quoting New York v. United States , 505 U.S. 144, 186 (1992)); NFIB, 567 U.S. at 692 (joint dissent). Second, even if the remaining provisions can operate as Congress designed them to, the court must determine if Congress would have enacted the remain-ing provisions without the unconstitutional portion. If Congress would not have done so, then those provi- sions must be deemed inseverable. Alaska Airlines , 480 U.S. at 685 (\"[T]he unconstitutional provision must be severed unless the statute created in its ab- sence is legislation that Congress would not have en- acted.\"); Free Enter. Fund , 561 U.S. at 509 (\"[N]othing in the statute's text or historical context makes it evi- dent that Congress, faced with the limitations im- posed by the Constitution, would have preferred no Board at all to a Board wh ose members are removable at will.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Severability doctrine places courts between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, courts strive to be faithful agents of Congress, 39 which often means re- fusing to create a hole in a statute in a way that cre- ates legislation Congress never would have agreed to or passed. See Murphy v. NCAA , 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1482 (2018) (\"[Courts] cannot rewr ite a statute and give it an effect altogether different from that sought by the 39 See Frank H. Easterbrook, Text, History, and Structure in Stat- utory Interpretation , 17 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol'y 61, 63 (1994) (\"[Courts] are supposed to be faithful agents, not independent principals.\"). 429 measure viewed as a whole.\" (quoting R.R. Ret. Bd. v. Alton R.R. , 295 U.S. 330, 362 (1935))). On the other hand, courts often try to abide by the medical practi- tioner's maxim of \"first, do no harm,\" aiming \"to limit the solution to the problem\" by \"refrain[ing] from in- validating more of the statute than is necessary.\" Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of N. New England , 546 U.S. 320, 328 (2006); Collins v. Mnuchin , 938 F.3d 553, 592 (5th Cir. 2019) (en banc) (Haynes, J.) (severing un- constitutional removal restriction from remainder of Federal Housing Finance Agency's enabling statute). 40 In fact, courts have a \"duty\" to \"maintain the act in so far as it is valid\" if it \"contains unobjectionable provi- sions separable to be unconstitu- tional.\" Alaska Airlines , 480 U.S. at 684 (quoting Regan v. Time, Inc. , 468 U.S. 641, 652 (1984) (plurality opinion)). The Supreme Court emphasizes this duty so strongly that commentators have identified \"a pre- sumption [of severability] implicit in jurisprudence. Adrian Vermeule, Saving Constructions , 85 Geo. L.J. 1945, 1950 n.28 (1997); see also Brian Charles Lea, Situational Severability , 103 Va. L. Rev. 735, 744 (2017) (\" [C]ourts assume that a legislature intends for any unlawful part of its handi- work to be severable from all lawful parts in the ab- sence of indicia of a contrary intention.\"). This presumption is strongest when Congress includes a severability clause in the statutory text; however, \"[i]n the absence of a severability clause . . . Congress's si- 40 Judge Haynes wrote the opinion of the court as to the question of remedy. See Collins , 938 F.3d at 591. 430 lence is just that\u2014silence\u2014and does not raise a pre- sumption against severability.\" Alaska Airlines , 480 U.S. at 686. Nevertheless, the meticulous analysis required by severability doctrine defies reliance on presumptions or generalities. The Supreme Court's latest venture into severability territory, Murphy v. NCAA , 138 S. Ct. 1461 (2018), provides an example. There, the Court held that the entirety of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act was unconstitutional because one of its provisions\u2014authorizing private sports gam- bling\u2014violated the anti-commandeering doctrine. Id. at 1484. Justice Alito's majority opinion separately ex- plored each of the other oper ative provisions in the act, reasoning that all of the act's provisions were \"obvi- ously meant to work together\" and be \"deployed in tan- dem.\" Id. at 1483. Because Congress would not have wanted the otherwise-valid provisions \"to stand alone,\" the Court declined to sever them. Id. This conclusion prompted a dissent from Justice Ginsburg, who characterized the majority as \"wield[ing] an ax . . . instead of using a to trim the statute\" and reit- erated that \"the Court ordinarily engages in a salvage rather than a demolition operation.\" Id. at 1489-90 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). These Murphy opinions draw attention to one dif- ficulty inherent in severability analysis: selecting the right tool for the job. Justice Thomas' concurring opinion goes further, providing two reasons why nav-igating between the Scylla of poking small but crit- ical holes in complex, carefully crafted legislative bargains and the Charybdis of invalidating more duly enacted legislation than necessary stands \"in tension with traditional limits on judicial authority.\" Murphy , 431 138 concurring). \"[T]he ju- dicial power is, fundamentally, the power to render judgments in individual cases,\" and severability doc- trine threatens to violate that vital separation-of-pow-ers principle in more than one way. Id. (Thomas, J., concurring). First, severability doctrine requires \"a nebulous in- quiry into hypothetical congressional intent,\" as op- posed to the usual judicial bread-and-butter of \"determin[ing] what a statute means.\" Id. at 1486 (Thomas, J., conc urring) (quoting United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 at 321 n. 7 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting in part)). Becaus e \"Congress typically does not pass statutes with the expectation that some part will later be deemed unconstitutional,\" id. at 1487, this requirement often leaves courts to exercise their imagination or \"intuitions regarding what the legisla-ture would have desired had it considered the severa- bility issue.\" Lea, supra, at 747. This, in turn, \"enmeshes the judiciary in making policy choices\" the Constitution reserves for the legislature, David H. Gans, Severability as Judicial Lawmaking , 76 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 639, 663 (2008), providing unelected ju- dicial officers with cover to simply implement their own policy preferences. Second, severability doctrine forces courts to \"weigh in on statutory provisions that no party has standing to challenge, bringing courts dangerously close to issuing advisory opinions.\" Murphy , 138 S. Ct. at 1487 (Thomas, J., concurring); see also Jonathan F. Mitchell, The Writ-of-Erasure Fallacy , 104 Va. L. Rev. 933, 936 (2018) (\"The federal courts have no authority to erase a duly enacted law from the statute books, 432 [but can only] decline to enforce a statute in a partic- ular case or controversy.\"41). As Justice Thomas points out, when Chief Justice Marshall famously de-clared that \"[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is,\" he justified that assertion by explaining that \"[t]hose who apply [a] rule to particular cases, must of necessity ex-pound and interpret that rule.\" Marbury v. Madison , 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803). Yet severability doctrine directs courts to go beyond the necessary\u2014that is, the application of a particular statutory provi- sion to a particular case\u2014to consider the viability of other provisions without even \"ask[ing] whether the plaintiff has standing to challenge those other provi- sions.\" Murphy, 138 S. Ct. at 1487 (Thomas, J., con- curring). \"[S]everability doctrine is thus an unexplained exception to the normal rules of standing, as well as the separation-of-powers principles that those rules protect.\" Id. Severability analysis is at its most demanding in the context of sprawling (and amended) statutory schemes like the one at issue here. The ACA's framework of economic regulations and incentives spans over 900 pages of legislative text and is divided into ten ti- tles. Most of the provisions directly regulating health insurance, including the one challenged in this case, are found in Titles I and II. See, e.g. , 26 14(a) (requiring insurers offering family plans to cover adult children until age 26), \u00a7\u00a7 18031-18044 (creating 41 If that is true, then courts are speaking loosely when they state that they are \"invalidating\" or \"striking down\" a law. 433 health insurance exchanges). The other titles gener- ally amend Medicare (Title III), fund preventative healthcare programs (Title IV), seek to expand the supply of healthcare workers (Title V), enact anti-fraud requirements for Medicare/Medicaid facilities (Title VI), establish or expand drug regulations (Ti- tle VII), create a voluntary long-term care insurance program (Title VIII), address taxation (Title IX), and improve health care for Native Americans (Title X 42). The plaintiffs group this host of provisions into three categories for ease of reference. State Plaintiffs' Br. at 38. The first catego ry includes the three core ACA provisions the Supreme Court has called \"closely intertwined\": the individual mandate, 26 , 135 S. Ct. at 2487. The second category includes the remaining \"[m]ajor provisions of the Affordable Care Act,\" NFIB, 567 U.S. at 697 (joint dissent), namely other provi- sions dealing with \"insurance regulations and taxes,\" \"reductions in federal reimbursements to hospitals and other Medicare spending reductions,\" the insurance \"exchanges and their federal subsidies,\" and third category includes a variety of mi- nor provisions, for example taxes on certain medical devices or provisions requiring the display of nutri- tional content at restaurants. See, 343(q)(5)(H); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4191(a). 42 Title X also includes a number of miscellaneous provisions re- lating to the other titles. 434 Moreover, Congress has made a number of sub- stantive amendments to the ACA, revising the statute in 2010, 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2018. See, e.g. , Medi- care and Medicaid Extenders Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-309, 124 Stat. 3285 (2010) (modifying tax credit scale and Medicaid requirements); Department of De-fense and Full-Year Continui ng Appropriations Act, 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-10, 125 Stat. 38 (2011) (repeal- ing program that required some employers to provide some employees with vouchers for purchasing insur-ance); Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, Pub. L. No. 114-74, 129 Stat. 584 (2015) (repealing requirement that employers with more than 200 employees enroll new full-time employees in health insurance and con- tinue coverage for current employees). Most of these amendments occurred prior to the 2017 legislation eliminating the shared responsibility payment, but some are more recent. See, e.g. , Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-123, 132 Stat. 64 (2018) (repealing Independent Payment Advisory Board). In summary, then, this issue involves a challeng- ing legal doctrine applied to an extensive, complex, and oft-amended statutory scheme. All together, these observations highlight the need for a careful, granular approach to carrying out the inherently dif-ficult task of severability analysis in the specific con- text of this case. We are not persuaded that the approach to the severability question set out in the district court opinion satisfies that need. The district court opinion does not explain with precision how par- ticular portions of the ACA as it exists post-2017 rise or fall on the constitutionality of the individual man- date. Instead, the opin ion focuses on the 2010 Con- gress' labeling of the individual mandate as \"essential\" 435 to its goal of \"creating effective health insurance mar- kets,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 ignate the entire ACA inseverable. In using this approach, the opinion does not address the ACA's pro- visions with specificity, nor does it discuss how the in- dividual mandate fits within the post-2017 regulatory scheme of the ACA. The district court opinion begins by addressing the 2010 version of the ACA. Starting with the text of the ACA, the district court opin ion points out that the 2010 Congress incorporated into the text its view that \"the absence of the [individual mandate] would under- cut Federal regulation of the health insurance mar-ket.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(H). The district court opinion notes that the 2010 Congress devised the indi- vidual mandate, \"together with the other provisions\" of the ACA, to \"add millions of new customers to the health insurance market.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(C). In this way, the 2010 Congress sought to \"minimize th[e] adverse selection\" that might otherwise occur if healthy individuals \"wait[ed] to purchase health in- surance until they needed care,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(I)\u2014a strategic choice that would otherwise be available given the ACA's guaranteed-issue and community-rating provisions. According to the dis-trict court opinion: because the 2010 Congress found the individuate mandate \"essential\" to this plan to re- shape health insurance markets, the individual man-date is inseverable from the rest of the ACA \"[o]n the unambiguous enacted text alone.\" The district court opinion also addresses ACA caselaw. Citing the Supreme Court's decisions in NFIB and King , the district court opinion states that \"[a]ll nine Justices . . . agreed the Individual Mandate 436 is inseverable from at least the pre-existing-condition provisions.\" See NFIB , 567 U.S. at 548 (Roberts, C.J.), 596-98 (Ginsburg, J., joined by Breyer, Kagan, and So- tomayor, JJ.), 695-96 (joint dissent of Scalia, Ken- nedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.); King , 135 S. Ct. at 2487 (stating that the individual mandate is \"closely inter-twined\" with the guaranteed-issue and community- rating provisions). As to the ACA's other provisions, the district court opinion notes that the only group of Justices who fully considered whether the other major and minor provisions were severable was the joint dissent in NFIB\u2014and those Justices would have held that \"invalidation of the ACA's major provisions requires the Court to invalidate the ACA's other pro- visions.\" NFIB, 567 U.S. at 704 (joint dissent). Beyond these points, the district court opinion states that its \"conclusion would only be reinforced\" if it \"parse[d] the ACA's provisio ns one by one.\" The dis- trict court opinion arrives at this conclusion by reason- ing that declaring only the individual mandate unlawful would disrupt the Act's careful balance of \"shared responsibility.\" The district court opinion lists a few examples of how it would expect this to happen with regard to the ACA's major provisions. First, the district court opinion reasons that \"the Individual Mandate reduces the financial risk forced upon insur- ance companies and their customers by the ACA's ma- jor regulations and taxes.\" If the individual mandate fell and the regulations and taxes did not, insurance companies would suffer a burden without enjoying a countervailing benefit\u2014\"a choice no Congress made and one contrary to the text.\" Second, if a court were to declare just the individual mandate and the protec- tions for preexisting conditions unlawful\u2014but not the 437 subsidies for health insurance\u2014then the Act would be transformed into \"a law that subsidizes the kinds of discriminatory products Congress sought to abolish at, presumably, the re-inflated prices it sought to sup-press.\" Third, Congress never intended \"a duty on em- ployers, see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H, to cover the skyrocketing insurance premium costs\" that would \"inevitably result from removing\" the individual man- date. Fourth, because \"the Medicaid-expansion provi- sions were designed to serv e and assist fulfillment of the Individual Mandate,\" removing the individual mandate would remove the need for that expansion. As to the ACA's minor provis ions, the district court opinion states that it is \"i mpossible to know which mi- nor provisions Congress would have passed absent the Individual Mandate,\" and that such an inquiry in-volves too much \"legislative guesswork.\" Relying on the 2010 Congress' labeling of the individual mandate as \"essential,\" the district court opinion ultimately de-termines that there is \"no reason to believe that Con- gress would have enacted\" the minor provisions independently. The district court opinion similarly disclaims the ability to divine the intent of the 2017 Congress\u2014which had zeroed out the shared responsi- bility payment but left the rest of the ACA un-touched\u2014labeling such an inquiry \"a fool's errand.\" To the extent it analyzed the intent of the 2017 Con- gress, the district court opinion determines that Con-gress' failure to repeal the individual mandate shows that it \"knew that provision is essential to the ACA.\" In sum, the district court opinion concludes that the entire ACA is inseverable from the individual man- date. 438 The plaintiffs urge affirmance for essentially the same reasons stated in the district court opinion.43 As to the guaranteed-issue and community-rating provi- sions, they rely primarily on the 2010 Congress' ex-press findings linking those provisions to the individual mandate. State Plaintiffs' Br. at 39-44; In- dividual Plaintiffs' Br. at 47-48. The 2010 Congress found that, without the individual mandate, \"many in- dividuals would wait to pu rchase health insurance un- til they needed care,\" creating an \"adverse selection\" problem. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(I); see also id. (finding that the individual mandate is \"essential to creating effective health insurance markets in which improved health insurance products that are guaranteed issue and do not exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions can be sold\"). As to the remaining major and some of the minor provisions, the plaintiffs rely primarily on the joint dissent in NFIB for the proposition that leav- ing these provisions standing would \"undermine Con- gress' scheme of shared responsibility,\" throwing off the balance of the interlocking insurance market re- forms set out in the ACA. 567 U.S. at 698 (joint dis-sent) (internal quotation marks omitted); State Plaintiffs' Br. at 44-49. As for the most minor provi- sions, they argue that these were \"mere adjuncts\" of the more important provisions and would not have been independently enacted. State Plaintiffs' Br. at 50. On appeal, the federal defendants agree with the plaintiffs that the entirety of the ACA is inseverable from the individual mandate. Fed. Defendants' Br. at 43 The individual plaintiffs adopt the state plaintiffs' severability arguments by reference. See Fed. R. App. P. 28(i). 439 36-49. This marks a significant change in litigation position, as the federal defendants had previously sub- mitted to the district court that only the guaranteed- issue and community-rating provisions were insever-able. And that is not the only new argument the fed- eral defendants make on appeal. For the first time on appeal, the federal defendants argue that the remedy in this case should be limited to enjoining enforcement of the ACA only to the extent it harms the plaintiffs. See Fed. Defendants' Br. at 26-29 (arguing that the in- dividual \"plaintiffs do not have standing to seek relief against provisions of the ACA that do not in any way affect them\"); Fed. Defendan ts' Supp. Br. at 10 (\"[T]he judgment itself, as opposed to its underlying legal rea- soning, cannot be understood as extending beyond the plaintiff states to invalidate the ACA in the intervenor states.\"). The intervenor-defendant states, meanwhile, ar- gue that every provision of the ACA is severable from the individual mandate. They argue that the 2017 Congress' decision not to repeal or otherwise under- mine any other provision of the ACA shows that it in-tended the rest of the ACA to remain operative\u2014and that the court should not focus on the intent of the 2010 Congress. Intervenor-Defendant States' Br. at 34-35, 43. They point to the statements of several leg- islators in the 2017 Congress that seem to evince an assumption that other parts of the ACA would not be altered, 44 and to Congress' knowledge of reports high- lighting the severe consequences a total invalidation 44 Although we decline to opine on the merits of the parties' argu- ments at this juncture, we cautio n against relying on individual 440 of the ACA would have. Inte rvenor-Defendant States' Br. at 40. Finally, they argu e that the passage of time since the ACA's enactment has shown that the indi- vidual mandate is not all that crucial after all, and they provide examples of ACA provisions they say have nothing to do with insurance markets or became oper-ative years before the individual mandate took effect. Intervenor-Defendant States' Br. at 45. Although we understand and share the district court's general disinclination to engage in what it re-fers to as \"legislative guesswork\"\u2014and what a Su- preme Court Justice has de scribed as \"a nebulous inquiry into hypothetical congressional intent,\" S. at 1486 (Thomas, J., concurring) (quot- ing Booker , 543 U.S. at 321 n.7 (Thomas, J., dissenting in part))\u2014we nevertheless conclude that the severa- bility analysis in the district court opinion is incom- plete in two ways. statements by legislators to determine the meaning of the law. \"[L]egislative history is not the law.\" Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis , 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1631 (2018); see also Asadi G.E. Energy (USA), LLC, 720 F.3d 620, 626 n.9 (5th Cir. 2013) (\"[T]he authoritative statement is the statutory text, not the legislative history or any other extrinsic material.\" (quoting Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapat- tah Servs., Inc. , 545 U.S. 546, 568 (2005))); Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 392-93 (2012) (\"Each member voting for the bill has a slightly different reason for doing so. There is no single set of intentions shared by all . . . [y]et a majority has undeniably agreed on the final language that passes into law . . . and that is the sole means by which the assembly has the authority to make law.\"). And even among legislative history devotees, \"floor state-ments by individual legislators rank among the least illuminat-ing forms.\" N.L.R.B. v. SW Gen., Inc. , 137 S. Ct. 929, 943 (2017). 441 First, the opinion gives relatively little attention to the intent of the 2017 Congress, which appears in the analysis only as an aftertho ught despite the fact that the 2017 Congress had the benefit of hindsight over the 2010 Congress: it was able to observe the ACA's actual implementation. Although the district court opinion states that burdening insurance companies with taxes and regulations without giving them the benefit of compelling the purc hase of their product is \"a choice no Congress made,\" it only links this obser- vation to the 2010 Congress. It does not explain its statement that the 2017 Congre ss' failure to repeal the individual mandate is evidence of an understanding that no part of the ACA could survive without it. Second, the district court opinion does not do the necessary legwork of parsing through the over 900 pages of the post-2017 ACA, explaining how par- ticular segments are inextricably linked to the individ- ual mandate. The opinion lists a few examples of major provisions and cogently explains their link to the individual mandate, at least as it existed in 2010. For example, the opinion discusses the individual mandate's interplay with the guaranteed- issue and community-rating provisions \u2014all of which are found in Title I of the ACA\u2014analyzing how Congress in- tended those provisions to work and how they might be expected to work without the individual mandate. But in order to strike the delicate balance that sever-ability analysis requires, th e district court must un- dertake a similar inquiry for each segment of the post-2017 law that it ultimately declares unlawful\u2014and it has not done so. Instead, the district court opinion fo- cuses on the 2010 Congress' designation of the individ- ual mandate as \"essential to creating effective health 442 insurance markets\" and intention that, for at least one set of legislative goals, the individual mandate was in- tended to work \"together with the other provisions\" of the ACA. E.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(I). On this basis, and on the views of the dissenting Justices in NFIB addressing the ACA as it stood in 2012, the district court opinion renders the entire ACA inoperative. More is needed to justify the district court's remedy. Take, for example, the ACA pr ovisions in Title IV re- quiring certain chain restaurants to disclose to con-sumers nutritional information like \"the number of calories contained in the standard menu item.\" Pa- tient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, \u00a7 4206, 124 Stat. 119, 573-74 (2012) (codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343). Or consider the provisions in Ti- tle X establishing the level of scienter necessary to be convicted of healthcare fraud. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u00a7 10606, 124 Stat. 119, 1006-09, (codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347) . Without more detailed analysis from the district court opinion, it is unclear how provisions like these\u2014w hich certainly do not di- rectly regulate the health insurance marketplace\u2014 were intended to work \"together\" with the individual mandate. Similarly, the district court opinion's asser- tion that \"most of the[] effective exe- cution\" of the project of the individual mandate is not supported by the actual analysis in the district court opinion, which does not dive into those provi- sions. Finally, some insurance-related reforms be-came law years before the effective date of the individual mandate; the district court opinion does not explain how provisions like these are inextricably linked to the individual mandate. See, e.g. , 42 U.S.C. 443 \u00a7\u00a7 300gg-11, 300gg-14(a). Whatever the solution to the problem of \"legislative guesswork\" the district court opinion identifies in severability doctrine as it currently stands, it must include a careful parsing of the statutory scheme at issue to address questions like these. We have long \"require[d] that a district court ex- plain its reasons for granting a motion for summary judgment in sufficient detail for us to determine whether the court correctly applied the appropriate le-gal test.\" Wildbur v. ARCO Chem. Co. , 974 F.2d 631, 644 (5th Cir. 1992). This is because we have \"little op-portunity for effective review\" when the district court opinion leaves some reasoning \"vague\" or \"unsaid.\" Myers v. Gulf Oil Corp. , 731 F.2d 281, 284 (5th Cir. 1984). \"In such cases, we have not hesitated to re- mand . . . .\" Id. In this case, the analysis the district court opinion provides is substantial and far exceeds the sort of cursory reasoning that normally prompts us to remand. Yet, the vast, wide-ranging statutory scheme at issue in this case also far exceeds the com- paratively small number of provisions at issue in other severability cases, see, e.g. , Chadha , 462 U.S. at 931-35 (considering whether 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 244(c)(2) could be severed from the rest of \u00a7 244)\u2014especially cases in which entire legislative acts are determined to be inseverable, see, e.g. , Murphy , 138 S. Ct. at 1481- 84 (considering whether part of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(1) could be severed from \u00a7\u00a7 3701-04). Moreover, the Supreme Court has remanded in the severability context upon a determination that addi-tional analysis was necessary. In Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, 546 U.S. 320 (2006), the Supreme Court took up the issue of what 444 relief was appropriate upon a determination that a New Hampshire provision requiring parental notifica- tion prior to abortion was unconstitutional in some ap- plications. Id. at 328-32. The Supreme Court determined that, although the district court's choice to use \"the most blunt remedy\"\u2014total inseverability\u2014 was \"understandable\" under its own precedent, more analysis was needed to determine \"whether New Hampshire's legislature intended the statute to be sus- ceptible to\" severability. Id. at 330-31. As a result, Supreme Court remanded for \"lower courts to de- termine legislative intent in the first instance.\" Id. We do the same here, direct ing the district court to employ a finer-toothed comb on remand and conduct a more searching inquiry into which provisions of the ACA Congress intended to be inseverable from the in-dividual mandate. We do not hold forth on just how fine-toothed that comb should be\u2014the district court may use its best judgment to determine how best to break the ACA down into constituent groupings, seg- ments, or provisions to be analyzed. Nor do we make any comment on whether the district court should take into account the government's new posture on ap- peal or what the ultimate outcome of the severability analysis should be. 45 Although \"we cannot affirm the order as it is presently su pported,\" we do not suggest what result will be merited \"[a]fter a more thorough inquiry.\" Unger v. Amedisys Inc. , 401 F.3d 316, 325 (5th Cir. 2005). We only note that the inquiry must be 45 The district court should also consider this court's recent sev- erability analysis in Collins v. Mnuchin , 938 F.3d 553 (5th Cir. 2019) (en banc). That opinion was issued after both the district court's decision and the oral argument here. 445 made, and that the distri ct court\u2014which has many tools at its disposal\u2014is best positioned to determine in the first instance whether the ACA \"remains 'fully op- erative as a law'\" and whethe r it is evident from \"the statute's text or historic al context\" that Congress would have preferred no ACA at all to an ACA without the individual mandate. Free Enter. Fund , 561 U.S. at 509 (quoting New York , 505 U.S. at 186). It may still be that none of the ACA is severable from the individual mandate, even after this inquiry is concluded. It may be that all of the ACA is severable from the individual mandate. It may also be that some of the ACA is severable from the individual mandate, and some is not. 46 But it is no small thing for une- lected, life-tenured judges to declare duly enacted leg-islation passed by the elected representatives of the American people unconstitutional. The rule of law de- mands a careful, precise explanation of whether the provisions of the ACA are a ffected by the unconstitu- tionality of the individual mandate as it exists today. 46 For an explanation of some, but certainly not all, of the poten- tial conclusions with re gard to severability, see Josh Blackman, Undone: The New Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare , 23 Tex. Rev. L. & Pol. 1, 28-51 (2018) (stating that the district court could halt the enforcement of just the individual mandate, halt the enforcement of the entire Act, or halt the enforcement of the community-rating and guaranteed-issue provisions along with the individual mandate, for exam ple). The district court could also issue a declaratory judgment without enjoining any govern-ment official. 446 B. Remand is appropriate in this case for a second reason: so that the district court may consider the fed- eral defendants' new arguments as to the proper scope of relief in this case. The relief the plaintiffs sought in the district court was a universal nationwide injunc- tion: an order that totally \"enjoin[ed] Defendants from enforcing the Affordable Care Act and its associated regulations.\" Before the district court, the federal de- fendants urged entry of a declaratory judgment stating that the guaranteed-issue and community-rating pro- visions\u2014at that time, the only provisions the federal defendants argued were inseverable\u2014were \"inva- lid[ated]\" by the zeroing out of the shared responsibil- ity payment. This would be \"sufficient relief against the Government,\" the federal defendants argued, be-cause a declaratory judgment would \"operate[] in a similar manner as an injunction\" against the federal government, which would be \"presumed to comply with the law\" once the court provides \"a definitive interpre- tation of the statute.\" Ultimately, of course, the district court opinion de- termined that no ACA provision was severable and re-sulted in a judgment declaring the entire ACA \"invalid.\" On appeal, the federal defendants first changed their litigation position to agree that no ACA provision was severable. Now they have changed their litigation position to argue that relief in this case should be tailored to enjoin enforcement of the ACA in only the plaintiff states\u2014and not just that, but that the declaratory judgment should only reach ACA pro-visions that injure the plaint iffs. They argue that the Supreme Court has made clear that \"[a] plaintiff's 447 remedy must be tailored to redress the plaintiff's par- ticular injury.\" Gill v. Whitford , 138 S. Ct. 1916, (2018); see also Printz v. United States , 521 U.S. 898, 935 (1997) (reasoning that the Court has \"no business answering\" questions dealing with enforcement of pro- visions that \"burden . . . no plaintiff\"); see also S. Ct. at 1485-86 (Thomas, J., concurring). This argument came as a surprise to the plaintiffs, who ex- plained at oral argument that they saw the govern- ment's new position as a possible \"bait and switch.\" The federal defendants admitted at oral argument that they had raised the scope-of-relief issue on appeal \"for the first time,\" but argued that it was necessary to address, as it went to the district court's Article III ju- risdiction. The federal defendants therefore suggested that it \"would be appropriate to remand to consider the scope of the judgment.\" The court agrees that remand is appropriate for the district court to consider these new arguments in the first instance. The district court did not have the ben- efit of considering them wh en it crafted the relief now on appeal. 47 On remand, the district court\u2014which is in a far better position than this court to determine which ACA provisions actually injure the plaintiffs\u2014 may consider the federal defendants' position on the proper relief to be afforded. As part of this inquiry, the district court may consid er whether the federal de- fendants' arguments were timely raised, and whether limiting the remedy in this case is supported by Su- preme Court precedent. On ce again, we place no 47 The consideration of limited relief may affect the intervenors as well. The district court is better suited to resolving these is- sues in the first instance. 448 thumb on the scale as to the ultimate outcome; the dis- trict court is free to weigh the federal defendants' changed arguments as it sees fit. VII. For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part and VACATED in part. We REMAND for proceedings consistent with this opinion. 449 KING, Circuit Judge, dissenting: Any American can choose not to purchase health in- surance without legal consequence. Before January 1, 2018, individuals had to choose between complying with the Affordable Care Act 's coverage requirement or making a payment to the IRS. For better or worse, Congress has now set that payment at $0. Without any enforcement mechanism to speak of, questions about the legalit y of the individual \" mandate \" are purely ac- ademic, and people can purchase insurance \u2014or not\u2014 as they please. No more need be said; it has long been settled that the federal courts deal in cases and con- troversies, not academic curiosities. The majority sees things differently and today holds that an unenforceable law is also unconstitu-tional. If the majority had stopped there, I would be confident its extrajurisdictional musings would ulti- mately prove harmless. What does it matter if the cov- erage requirement is unenforceable by congressional design or constitutional demand? Either way, that law does not do anything or bind anyone. But again, the majority disagrees. It feels bound to ask whether Congress would want the rest of the Af- fordable Care Act to remain in force now that the cov- erage requirement is unenforceable. Answering that question should be easy, since Congress removed the coverage requirement 's only enforcement mechanism but left the rest of the Affordable Care Act in place. It is difficult to ima gine a plainer indication that Con- gress considered the coverage requirement entirely dispensable and, hence, severable. And yet, the major- ity is unwilling to resolve the severability issue. In- stead, it merely identifies serious flaws in the district court 's analysis and remands for a do -over, which will 450 unnecessarily prolong this litigation and the concomi- tant uncertainty over the future of the healthcare sec- tor. I would vacate the district court 's order because none of the plaintiffs have standing to cha llenge the coverage requirement. And although I would not reach the merits or remedial issues, if I did, I would conclude that the coverage requirement is constitutional, albeit unenforceable, and entirely severable from the re- mainder of the Affordable Car e Act. I. To my mind, this case begins and ought to end with the Supreme Court 's decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius , 567 U.S. 519 (2012). In that case, the Court held that the coverage requirement would be unconstitutional if it were a le- gal command, because neither the Commerce Clause nor the Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to compel individuals to engage in commerce by pur- chasing health insurance. See NFIB , 567 U.S. at 552, 560 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.); id. at 652-53 (joint dis- sent). The Court concluded, however, that the cover- age requirement was constitutional, because\u2014 notwithstanding the most natural reading of the pro- vision 's text\u2014 the coverage requirement was not actu- ally a legal command to purchase insura nce. Instead, according to the NFIB Court, the coverage requirement \" leaves an individual with a lawful choice to do or not do a certain act, \" i.e., purchase health in- surance. Id. at 574 (Roberts, C.J., majority opinion). All that is required, under this reading, is \" a payment to the IRS \" if one chooses not to purchase health in- surance. Id. at 567. Beyond this shared -responsibility 451 payment, there are no further \" negative legal conse- quences to not buying health insurance, \" and individ- uals who forgo insurance do not violate the law as long as they make the required payment. Id. at 567. \"Those subject to the [coverage requirement] may lawfully forgo health insurance and pay higher taxes, or buy health insurance and pay lower taxes. The only thing they may not l awfully do is not buy health insurance and not pay the resulting tax. \" Id. at 574 n.11. Forcing individuals to make that choice was constitutional, per NFIB , because Congress could \" impose a tax on not obtaining health insurance \" by exercising its enumer- ated power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises. Id. at 570. Contrary to the suggestion of the majority, which I address specifically infra at Part III, Congress did not alter the coverage requirement 's operation when it amended the ACA in 2017. See Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Pub. L. No. 115-97, \u00a7 11081, 131 Stat. 2054, 2092 (\" TCJA \"). All the TCJA did, with respect to healthcare, was change the amount of the shared -re- sponsibility payment to zero dollars. Thus, despite tex-tual appearances , the post -TCJA coverage requirement does nothing more than require individ-uals to pay zero dollars to the IRS if they do not pur-chase health insurance, which is to say it does nothing at all. This insight, that the coverage requirement now does nothing, should be the end of this case. Nobody has standing to challenge a law that does nothing. When Congress does nothing, no matter the form that nothing takes, it does not exceed its enumerated pow- ers. And since courts do not change anything when they invalida te a law that does nothing, every other 452 law retains, or at least should retain, its full force and effect. II. But as the majority goes well past NFIB , I respond. To begin, I emphasize the importance of the rule that a plaintiff must have standing to invok e a federal court 's power. This is not an anachronism lingering from some era in which empty formalities abounded in legal practice. Quite the opposite: \" [T]he requirement that a claimant have ' standing is an essential and un- changing part of the case -or-controversy requirement of Article III. '\" Davis v. FEC , 554 U.S. 724, 733 (2008) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)); see also Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 157 (2014) ( \"Article III of the Constitu- tion limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to ' Cases' and 'Controversies. '\" (quoting U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2)). And \" [n]o principle is more fundamental to the judiciary 's proper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of federal -court ju- risdiction to actual cases or Int'l USA , 568 U.S. 398, 408 (2013) (alteration in v. Cuno , 547 Raines 818 (1997). The Constituti on's case -or-controversy require- ment reflects the Framers ' view of the judiciary 's place among the coequal branches of the federal govern- ment: to fulfill \" the traditional role of Anglo- American courts, which is to redress or prevent actual or immi-nently th reatened injury to persons caused by private or official violation of law.\" Summers v. Earth Island Inst. , 555 U.S. 488, 492 (2009). Strict adherence to the case-or-controversy requirement \u2014and to standing in 453 particular\u2014thus \"serves to prevent the judicial pro- cess from being used to usurp the powers of the politi- cal branches. \" Clapper , 568 U.S. at 408; see also Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017) ( \"This fundamental limitation preserves the 'tripartite structure ' of our Federal Government, pre- vents the Federal Judiciary from ' intrud[ing] upon the powers given to the other branches, ' and 'confines the federal courts to a properly judicial role. '\" (alteration in original) (quoting Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins , 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016))). Thus, \"federal courts may exercise power only ' in the last resort, and as a necessity, ' and only when adjudication is ' consistent with a system of separated powers and [the dispute is one] traditionally thought to be capable of resolution through the judi- cial process. '\" Allen v. Wright , 468 U.S. 737, 752 (1984) (alteration in original) (citation omitted) (first quoting Chi. & Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Wellman , 143 U.S. 339, 345 (1892); then quoting Flast v. Cohen , 392 U.S. 83, 97 (1968)), abrogated on o ther grounds , Lexmark Int 'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc. , 572 U.S. 118 (2014). And needless to say, a federal court must conduct an \"especially rigorous \" standing inquiry \"when reaching the merits of the dispute would force [it] to decide whether an action taken by one of the other two branches of the Federal Government was unconstitutional. \" Amnesty Int'l, 568 U.S. at 408 (quot- ing Raines , 521 U.S. at 819- 20). \"The importance of this precondition should not be underestimated as a means of ' defin [ing] the role assigned to the judiciary in a tripartite allocation of power. '\" Valley Forge Chris- tian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church & State , 454 U.S. 464, 474 (1982) (alteration in original) (quoting Flast , 392 U.S. at 95). The standing do ctrine polices this constitutional limit on the judiciary 's power \" by 'identify[ing] those 454 disputes which are appropriately resolved through the judicial process. '\" Susan B. Anthony List , 573 U.S. at 157 (alteration in original) (quoting Lujan , 504 U.S. at 560). The party seeking redress in the courts has the burden to establish standing. See Spokeo , 136 S. Ct. at 1547. To do so, the plaintiff must show it has \" (1) suf- fered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. \" Id. \"To establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered ' an invasion of a legally pro- tected interest' that is 'concrete and particularized ' and 'actua l or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. '\" Id. at 1548 (quoting Lujan , 504 U.S. 560). This means the injury must be \"personal\" to the plaintiff and, alt- hough the injury does not need to be \"tangible, \" \"it must actually exist. \" Id. at 1548- 49. The pl aintiffs ' evidentiary burden depends on the stage of the litigation. At each stage, the plaintiffs must demonstrate standing \"with the manner and de- gree of evidence\" otherwise required to establish the plaintiffs ' merits case. Lujan , 504 U.S. at 561. Thus, because this case comes to us on the plaintiffs ' own motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs must conclusively prove all three elements of standing with evidence that \" would 'entitle [them] to a directed ver- dict if the evidence went uncontroverted at trial. '\" Int'l Shortstop, Inc. v. Rally 's, Inc. , 939 F.2d 1257, 1264- 65 (5th Cir. 1991) (quoting Golden Rule Ins. Co. v. Lease, 755 F. Supp. 948, 951 (D. Colo. 1991)). If a plaintiff meets its burden, the defendant can nevertheless de-feat summary judgment \" by merely demonstrating the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact. \" Id. at 1265. In other words, the plaintiffs here must show that, considering the summary -judgment record, all reasonable factfinders would agree that the plaintiffs 455 demonstrate an injury traceable to the coverage re- quirement and redressable by a favorable decision. See Alonso v. Westcoast Corp. , 920 F.3d 878, 885- 86 (5th Cir. 2019). These general principles alone should make the majority 's error apparent. More specific authority illu- minates it. I explain first why the majority errs in con- cluding the individual plaintiffs have standing, then I explain why the majority errs in concluding the state plaintiffs have standing. A. The majority concludes that the individual plain- tiffs ha ve standing to challenge the coverage require- ment in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \"ACA\" ), 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5000A(a),1 because it forces them to purchase health insurance that they would not purchase otherwise. The majority overlooks what will happen if the individual plaintiffs fail to pur- chase insurance: absolutely nothing. The individual plaintiffs will be no worse off by any conceivable meas- ure if they choose not to purchase health insurance. Thus, whatever injury the individual plainti ffs have incurred by purchasing health insurance is entirely self-inflicted. A long line of cases establishes that self -inflicted injuries cannot establish standing because a self-in- flicted injury, by definition, is not traceable to the chal- lenged action. See, e.g. , Amnesty Int 'l, 568 U.S. at 416 (\"[R]espondents cannot manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on themselves . . . . \"); Pennsylvania v. New Jersey , 426 U.S. 660, 664 (1976) (\"The injuries 1 The coverage requirement is sometimes colloquially known as the \"individual mandate.\" For reasons that will become clear, this nickname can be misleading. 456 to the plaintiffs ' fiscs were self -inflicted, resul ting from decisions by their respective state legislatures. . . . No State can be heard to complain about damage inflicted by its own hand. \"); Zimmerman v. City of Aus- tin, 881 F.3d 378, 389 (5th Cir.) (\"[S]tanding cannot be conferred by a self-inflicted injury. \"), cert. denied , 139 S. Ct. 639 (2018). When a plaintiff chooses to incur an expense, the plaintiff must show that the challenged law forced the plaintiff to incur that expense to avoid some other concrete injury. See Amnesty Int 'l, 568 U.S. at 415-16 (concluding costs plaintiffs incurred trying to avoid surveillance were self -inflicted because plain- tiffs' fear of surveillance was speculative); Contender Farms, L.L.P. v. USDA , 779 F.3d 258, 266 (5th Cir. 2015) (finding plaintiff had standing to challe nge reg- ulations that required plaintiff to either \" take addi- tional measures \" to comply with regulation or \" face harsher, mandatory penalties \" and prosecution). In other words, a plaintiff can show standing if the chal- lenged act placed him between the prove rbial rock and hard place. But without showing such a dilemma, a plaintiff \"cannot manufacture standing \" by expending costs to avoid an otherwise noncognizable injury, which is exactly what the individual plaintiffs did here. Amnesty Int'l, 568 U.S. at 416. The majority brushes off this authority by insist- ing\u2014without explanation \u2014that labeling the plain- tiffs' injuries self -inflicted \"assumes\" that the coverage requirement does not act as a legal command to pur- chase insurance, which the majority refuses to ques- tion at the standing stage. The majority misunderstands the argument. Even accepting that the coverage requirement acts as a legal command, the individual plaintiffs are still free to disregard that command without legal consequence. Therefore, any 457 injur y they incur by freely choosing to obtain insur- ance is still self-inflicted. Nor does it matter that to avoid inflicting injury upon themselves, the plaintiffs would have to violate an unenforceable statute. Plaintiffs may challenge a statute that requires them \"to take significant and costly compliance measures or risk criminal prosecu- tion.\" Virginia v. Am. Booksellers Ass'n , 484 U.S. 383, 392 (1988) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Int'l Tape Mfrs. Ass' n v. 28 (5th Cir. 1974) (expl aining that standing to challenge a statute re- quires a \" realistic possibility that the challenged stat- ute will be enforced to [the plaintiff 's] detriment\" ). But \"[w]hen plaintiffs ' do not claim that they have ever been threatened with prosecution, that a p rosecution is likely, or even that a prosecution is remotely possible, ' they do not allege a dispute susceptible to resolution by a federal court. \" Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat'l Union , 442 U.S. 289, 298- 99 (1979) (quoting Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 42 (1971)); see also Poe v. Ullman , 367 U.S. 497, 507 (1961) (Frankfurter, J., plurality) (\"It is clear that the mere existence of a state penal statute would constitute insufficient grounds to support a federal court 's adjudication of its constitutio nality in proceedings brought against the State 's prosecuting officials if real threat of enforce- ment is wanting. \"); cf. Zimmerman , 881 F.3d at 389 -90 (\"[T]o confer standing, allegations of chilled speech or 'self-censorship must arise from a fear of prosecution that is not \" imaginary or wholly speculative. \"'\" (quot- ing Ctr. for Individual Freedom v. Carmouche, 449 F.3d 655, 660 (5th Cir. 2006))). 458 Ullman illustrates this principle well.2 The plain- tiffs there sought to challenge Connecticut 's criminal prohibi tion on contraception. Ullman , 367 U.S. at 498 (Frankfurter, J., plurality). But in the more than 75 years that the statute had been on the books, only one violation had been prosecuted \u2014and even that was a collusive prosecution brought to challenge the law . Id. at 501-02. The Court dismissed the challenge for lack of standing, holding that \" [t]he fact that Connecticut has not chosen to press the enforcement of this statute deprives these controversies of the immediacy which is an indispensable condition of constitutional adjudi- cation. \" Id. at 508. The Court explained that it could not \"be umpire to debates concerning harmless, empty shadows. \" Id.3 2 The majority dismisses Ullman as an adversity case. Nonethe- less, as this court and the Supreme Court have repeatedly recog- nized, Ullman grounds its analysis in terms of standing and ripeness. See, e.g. , Blum v. Yaretsky , 457 U.S. 991, 1000 (1982); Roark & Hardee LP v. City of Austin , 522 F.3d 533, 544 (5th Cir. 2008); Thomes Loan Ass'n , 837 F.2d 1317, 1318 (5th Cir. 1988). In any event, Ullman is just one example; other cases demonstrate this concept just as well. See, e.g. , Driehaus , 573 U.S. at 158-59 (\"One recurring issue in our cases is determining when the threatened enforcement of a law creates an Article III injury. . . . [W]e have permitted pre -enforcement review under circumstances that render the threatened enforce-ment sufficiently imminent.\"). 3 The lead opini on in Ullman garnered only a four -judge plural- ity. But Justice Brennan, who concurred in the judgment, wrote that he \"agree[d] that this appeal must be dismissed for failure to present a real and substantial controversy\" and that \"until the State makes a definite and concrete threat to enforce these laws . . . this Court may not be compelled to exercise its most delicate power of constitutional adjudication.\" Ullman , 367 U.S. at 509 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment). Accordingly, five Justices 459 Ullman makes this an easy case. Connecticut 's con- traception law at least allowed the possibility of en- forcement, even if it was speculative and unlikely to ever occur. Here, as I cannot say often enough, the cov- erage requirement has no enforcement mechanism . It is impossible for the individual plaintiffs to ever be prosecuted (or face any other consequences) for violat-ing it. In \"find[ing] it necessary to pass on \" the cover- age requirement, the majority \" close[s] [its] eyes to reality. \" Id. 4 The majority does not engage with the lessons of Ullman and its progeny. The closest it comes is in its citation to Texas v. EEO C, 933 F.3d 433 (5th Cir. 2019). That case does not abrogate Ullman , Younger , Babbitt , American Booksellers, or Manufactur- ers\u2014nor could it. In Texas v. EEOC , Texas challenged EEOC administrative guidance stating that employ- ers who screen out job appli cants with criminal rec- ords could be held liable for disparate- impact discrimination. Id. at 437 -38. The EEOC argued that Texas did not have standing to challenge the guidance because the guidance reflected only the EEOC 's inter- pretation of Title VII, and the Attorney General, not the EEOC, has the sole power to enforce Title VII agreed that plaintiffs lacked standing absent any real threat of enforcement. 4 For the same reason, it does not matter that the district court \"expressly found\" that the individual plaintiffs \"are obligated to\" purchase health insurance. Even ignoring the concluso ry nature of this supposed finding of fact, it is not the abstract obligation that matters; it is the concrete consequences, if any, that follow from a violation of that obligation. And the district court did not find (and there would be no basis for it to find) that the individual plaintiffs would face any consequences. 460 against states. See Brief for Appellants Cross -Appel- lees at 18 -19, Texas v. EEOC , 933 F.3d 433 (5th Cir. 2019) (No. 18- 10638). In rejecting that argument, this court explained that Title VII' s enforcement scheme is not so simple. Although the EEOC may not itself bring enforcement actions against states, it may investigate states and refer cases to the Attorney General for en-forcement actions. EEOC, 933 F.3d at 447. Therefore, \"the possibility of investigation by EEOC and referral to the Attorney General for enforcement proceedings if it fails to align its laws and policies with the Guid- ance \" put pressure on Texas to conform to the EEOC 's guidance. Id. In other words, even absent a di rect threat of a for- mal enforcement action from the EEOC, Texas faced other consequences for disobeying the guidance\u2014in-cluding the possibility that the Attorney General would enforce Title VII against it. In fact, we noted that \"[o]ne Texas agency ha[d] already been required to respond to a charge of discrimination filed with EEOC based on its no-felon hiring policy. \" Id. at 447 n.26. The majority here cites no similar concrete conse- quences that will (or even plausibly could) follow if the plaintiffs violat e the coverage requirement. My conclusion that individual plaintiffs lack stand- ing is only bolstered by a unanimous opinion issued mere weeks ago by a panel that included the author of today 's majority opinion. In that case, the court held that Austin, Tex as could not use a suit against the Texas Attorney General to challenge a state statute, which the Attorney General was authorized to enforce, that barred the city from enforcing one of its ordi- nances. City of Austin v. Paxton , No. 18 -50646, ___ F.3d ___, 2019 WL 6520769, at *6 (5th Cir Dec. 4, 2019). Although the Paxton court based its holding on 461 sovereign immunity, it looked to \" our standing juris- prudence, \" and \"note[d] that it' s unlikely the City had standing, \" because it did not show that the Attorney General would likely \" inflict 'future harm '\" by enforc- ing the statute against Austin. Id. at *6 -7. If standing was absent in Paxton because enforcement was insuf- ficiently probable, I have no idea why standing should be present in this case, where enforcemen t of the chal- lenged portion of the ACA is altogether impossible. In sum, even if the unenforceable coverage require- ment must be read as a command to purchase health insurance, it does not harm the individual plaintiffs because they can disregard it without consequence. Binding precedent squarely establishes that plaintiffs may not sue in such circumstances \u2014and with good reason. The great power of the judiciary should not be invoked to disrupt the work of the democratic branches when the plaintiffs can easil y avoid injury on their own. 5 5 The majority's suggestion that NFIB , 567 U.S. at 552 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.), supports the individual plaintiffs' standing does not warrant above -the-line attention. In short, the NFIB Court did not address standing. See id. at 530-708. At the time NFIB was decided, the coverage requirement was set to take effect with the shared -responsibility payment as an enforcement mecha- nism. And there is no indication that any of the NFIB plaintiff s were exempt from the shared -responsibility payment. Thus, even if the majority seeks to infer from NFIB some jurisdictional rul- ing in violation of the Supreme Court's \"repeated[]\" command \"that the existence of unaddressed jurisdictional defects has no precedential effect,\" Lewis v. Casey , 518 U.S. 343, 352 n.2 (1996), NFIB offers no inferences of value for the majority to draw. Fur- ther, counsel's answer to a Justice's hypothetical question does not bind this court. 462 B. The majority 's conclusion that the state plaintiffs have standing to challenge the coverage requirement fares no better. I would deny the state plaintiffs stand-ing because there is no evidence in the record, much less con clusive evidence, to support the state plain- tiffs' alleged injuries. 1. The majority first concludes that the state plain- tiffs have standing because it believes that the cover- age requirement increases the number of state employees who enroll in the states ' employee healthcare programs. And with more enrollees, the logic goes, the states as employers must file more forms with the IRS at a higher cost to the states. The majority 's biggest mistake is that it ignores the posture of this case: the defendants app eal from the district court 's order granting summary judgment to the plaintiffs . Accordingly, the state plaintiffs face a tremendous evidentiary burden \u2014they must produce evidence so conclusive of the coverage requirement 's effect on their healthcare -admini stration costs that the evidence \" would 'entitle [them] to a directed verdict if the evidence went uncontroverted at trial. '\" Int'l Short- stop, 939 F.2d at 1264- 65 (quoting Golden Rule Ins., 755 F. Supp. at 951). 6 And the state plaintiffs provided 6 The district court was free to \u2014but di d not \u2014make findings of jurisdictional fact, which we would review for clear error. See Krim v. pcOrder.com, Inc. , 402 F.3d 489, 494 (5th Cir. 2005). In- deed, the district court did not address the state plaintiffs' stand- ing at all. Thus, for the state plain tiffs to establish standing on their own motion for summary judgment, they must show the summary -judgment evidence is conclusive. 463 no eviden ce at all, never mind conclusive evidence, to support the dubious notion that even a single state employee enrolled in one of state plaintiffs ' health in- surance programs solely because of the unenforceable coverage requirement.7 The majority relies on affidavits from several of the state plaintiffs ' healthcare administrators. But these affidavits only establish that the state plaintiffs incur costs complying with the IRS reporting requirements found in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6055(a) and 6056(a). And as the majority r ecognizes, these requirements are distinct from the coverage requirement. Accordingly, to trace the state plaintiffs ' reporting burden to the coverage re- quirement, the majority must additionally show that at least some state employees have enrolled in em-ployer- sponsored health insurance solely because of the unenforceable coverage requirement. The majority comes up empty at this step, pointing only to a conclu- sory statement from a South Dakota human -resources director claiming that the coverage requirement, not \u00a7\u00a7 6055(a) and 6056(a), caused South Dakota to incur its reporting expenses. This will not do. See, e.g. , Lujan v. Nat 'l Wildlife Fed'n, 497 U.S. 871, 888 (1990) (\"The object of [summary judgment] is not to replace conclu- sory allegations of the compla int or answer with con- clusory allegations of an affidavit. \"); Shaboon v. 7 The majority misunderstands my position. See Maj. Op. 32 n.31. The state plaintiffs do not need to identify a \"specific\" person that is likely to enroll, but they still must establish that at least one state employee will enroll as a result of the post-TCJA coverage re- quirement. Otherwise, the state plaintiffs' injuries are not trace- able to the provision they challenge and would not be redressed by its elimination. 464 Duncan, 252 F.3d 722, 737 (5th Cir. 2001) (\"[U]nsup- ported affidavits setting forth 'ultimate or conclusory facts and conclusions of law ' are insufficient to either support or defeat a motion for summary judgment. \" (alteration in original) (quoting Orthopedic & Sports Injury Clinic v. Wang Labs., Inc., 922 F.2d 220, 225 (5th Cir. 1991))).8 Citing Department of Commerce v. New York , 139 S. Ct. 2551 (2019), the majority argues the state plain- tiffs can establish standing by \" showing that third par- ties will likely react in predictable ways \" to the coverage requirement. Id. at 2566. But the majority 8 The majority suggests we must accept this statement as true be- cause the defendants did not \"challenge\" this evidence. The ma- jority cites no authority for this proposition, and I am at a loss to understand where the majority came up with its challenge rule. I know of nothing in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or the caselaw requiring litigants to \"challenge\" conclusory statements in declarations. On the contrary, courts in this circuit regularly confront and disregard conclusory statements in the summary - judgment record. See, e.g. , Tex. Capital Bank N.A. v. Dall. Road- ster, Ltd. (In re Dall. Roadster, Ltd.) , 846 F.3d 112, 124 (5th Cir. 2017); Brown v. Mid -Am. Apartments, 348 F. Supp. 3d 594, 602- 03 (W.D. Tex. 2018) . The district courts and litigants of this circuit will be surprised to learn about the majority's new summary - judgment rule. The majority also claims that the statement is not conclusory. But nothing in the affidavit addresses the post-TCJA coverage requ irement. The affiant states that his knowledge is \"related to the enactment of the ACA,\" which occurred in 2010. He focuses on \"financial costs associated with ACA regulations\" and con-cludes that \"South Dakota would be significantly burdened if the ACA remained law.\" The affidavit does not explain how the post - TCJA coverage requirement harms South Dakota. Such general-ities, untethered to the actual law at issue in this appeal, cannot establish standing \u2014especially not at the summary -judgment stage. 465 fails to explain why state employees who do not want health insurance would nevertheless pred ictably en- roll in health insurance solely because an unenforcea-ble statute, here the coverage requirement, directs them to do so. What the majority fails to mention in its discussion of Department of Commerce is that the \"predictable \" behavior at issue there was individuals \"choosing to violate their legal duty to respond to the census. \" Id. at 2565 (emphasis added). Thus, Depart- ment of Commerce shows that people will predictably violate the law when sufficiently incentivized to do so. This directly contrad icts the assumption undergirding much of the majority 's analysis\u2014that people tend to follow the law regardless of the incentives. And state employees who do not want to enroll in insurance have every incentive to violate the coverage requirement. 9 2. The m ajority similarly argues that the coverage re- quirement increases the number of individuals en-rolled in the state plaintiffs ' Medicaid programs. This 9 A Congr essional Budget Office report released shortly before Congress repealed the shared -responsibility payment further supports this notion. It concluded: If the [shared -responsibility payment] was eliminated but the [coverage requirement] was not repeal ed . . . . only a small number of people who enroll in insurance because of the [coverage requirement] under current law would continue to do so solely because of a will- ingness to comply with the law. Cong. Budget Office, Repealing the Individual Health In surance Mandate: An Updated Estimate at 1 (2017) (hereinafter \"CBO Report\"). On this record, we have been given no reason to believe that any of the state plaintiffs' employees are among this \"small number of people.\" Id. 466 argument fails for the same reason: the state plaintiffs produce no evidence\u2014let alone conclusive evidence\u2014 showing that anyone has enrolled in their Medicaid programs solely because of the unenforceable coverage requirement. To this end, the best the majority can scrape up is a statement from Teresa MacCartney, a Georgia budget official, stating that \" [a]fter t he imple- mentation of the ACA, [Georgia] experienced in- creased enrollment of individuals already eligible for Medicaid benefits under pre -ACA eligibility stand- ards. \" The majority 's takeaway is that the coverage re- quirement caused this increase. Maybe so. Bu t MacCartney 's statement refers specifically to the cov- erage requirement at the time of the ACA 's enactment, when the coverage requirement interacted with the shared -responsibility payment. This statement pro- vides no insight into how the coverage requirement af- fects Medicaid rolls after the shared -responsibility payment' s repeal. In fact, MacCartney signed her dec- laration on May 14, 2018, more than seven months be- fore the shared -responsibility payment 's repeal went into effect. See Budget Fiscal Year, 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-97, \u00a7 11081(b), 131 Stat. 2054, 2092 (2017). Accordingly, the majority 's analysis again rests on the necessary assumption that people will obey the coverage requirement regardless of the incentives, in direct contradiction to Department of Commerce. And because Medicaid is available to eligible recipients at little to no cost, it is especially unlikely that the unen- forceable coverage requirement would play any signif- icant part in anyone 's decision to enroll. It belies common sense to conclu de that anyone who would otherwise pass on the significant benefits of Medicaid would be motivated to enroll solely because of an un- enforceable law. 467 In sum, the majority cites no actual evidence tying any costs the state plaintiffs have incurred to the un- enforceable coverage requirement. The state plaintiffs accordingly cannot show an injury traceable to the coverage requirement, so they do not have standing to challenge the coverage requirement. III. I would not reach the merits of this case because, as explained in Part II, I would vacate the district court 's order for lack of standing. But as the majority errs on the merits too, I voice my disagreement. \"Neither the Act nor any other law attaches nega- tive legal consequences to not buying health insurance , beyond requiring a payment to the IRS.\" NFIB , 567 U.S. at 568 (Roberts, C.J., majority opinion). Now that Congress has zeroed out that payment, the coverage requirement affords individuals the same choice in- dividuals have had since the dawn of private he alth insurance, either purchase insurance or else pay zero dollars. Thus, to my mind, the majority 's focus on whether Congress's taxing power or the Necessary and Proper Clause authorizes Congress to pass a $0 tax is a red herring; the real question is whether Congress exceeds its enumerated powers when it passes a law 468 that does nothing.10 And of course it does not.11 Con- gress exercises its legislative power when it \" alter[s] the legal rights, duties and relations of persons. \" INS v. Chadha , 462 U.S. 919, 952 (1983); cf. id. (\" Not every action taken by either House is subject to the bicam- eralism and presentment requirements of Art. I. Whether actions taken by either House are, in law and fact, an exercise of legislative power depends not on their form but upo n 'whether they contain matter which is properly to be regarded as legislative in its character and effect. '\" (citation omitted) (quoting S. Rep. No. 1335, 54th Cong., 2d Sess., 8 (1897))). Lest the majority mistake my position and end up shadowboxing with \"bizarre metaphysical conclu- sions, \" \"quantum musings, \" or ersatz inconsistencies, Maj. Op. at 44 & n.40, I need to make something ex-plicit at the outset. The TCJA did not change the text or the meaning of the coverage requirement, but it did change the re al-world effects it produces. Before the TCJA, the two options afforded by the coverage re-quirement\u2014purchasing insurance or making a shared -responsibility payment \u2014were both burden- some, but Congress could force individuals to choose one of those options by exercising its Taxing Power. Today, the shared -responsibility payment 's meaning 10 \"In litigation generally, and in constitutional litigation most prominently, courts in the United States characteristically pause to ask: Is this conflict really necessary?\" Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona , 520 U.S. 43, 75 (1997). The majority would do well if it paused to ask whether it is necessary for a federal court to rule on whether the Constitution authorizes a $0 tax or other- wise prohibits Congress from passing a law that does nothing. The absurdity of these inquiries highlights the severity of the ma-jority's error in fi nding the plaintiffs have standing to challenge this dead letter. 11 The majority does not argue otherwise. 469 has not changed \u2014it still gives individuals the choice to purchase insurance or make a shared -responsibility payment\u2014but the amount of that payment is zero dol- lars, which means that the coverage requirement now does nothing. The majority 's contrary conclusion rests on the premise that the coverage requirement compels individuals to purchase health insurance. With this understanding, the majority says that the coverage re- quirement does exactly what the Supreme Court said it cannot do: compel participation in commerce. See NFIB , 567 U.S. at 552 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.); id. at 652-53 (joint dissent). This conclusion follows fine from the premise, but the premise is wrong. Despite its seemingly mandatory language, the coverage require- ment does not compel anyone to purchase health in- surance. In NFIB , although five Justices agreed that \" [t]he most straightforward reading of the [coverage require-ment] is that it commands individuals to purchase in- surance, \" id. at 562 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.); accord id. at 663 (joint dissent), applying the canon of consti- tutional avoidance, the Court rejected this interpreta-tion. Instead, the Court interpreted the coverage requirement to offer applica ble individuals a \" lawful choice \" between purchasing health insurance and pay- ing the shared -responsibility payment, which the Court interpreted as a valid exercise of Congress 's tax- ing power. Id. at 574 (Roberts, C.J., majority opinion). This is a permissi ble construction, the Court con- cluded, because \" [w]hile the [coverage requirement] clearly aims to induce the purchase of health insur- ance, it need not be read to declare that failing to do so is unlawful. \" Id. at 567- 68. The Court observed that \"[n]either the [ACA] nor any other law attaches 470 negative legal consequences to not buying health in- surance, beyond requiring a payment to the IRS. \" Id. at 568. And the Court further explained: Indeed, it is estimated that four million people each year will choose to pay the IRS rather than buy insurance. We would expect Congress to be troubled by that prospect if such conduct were unlawful. That Congress apparently re- gards such extensive failure to comply with the [coverage requirement] as tol-erable suggests that Con gress did not think it was creating four million out- laws. Id. (citation omitted). The NFIB Court 's application of constitutional avoidance as an interpretive tool does not mean that the Court rewrote the statute. Only Congress can do that. Rather, the Court was \" choosing between com- peting plausible interpretations of a statutory text, resting on the reasonable presumption that Congress did not intend the alternative which raises serious con- stitutional doubts. \" Clark v. Martinez , 543 U.S. 371, 381 (2005). \"The canon is thus a means of giving effect to congressional intent, not of subverting it. \" Id. at 382. Accordingly, when the Court ruled in NFIB that \"[t]hose subject to the [coverage requirement] may lawfully forgo health insurance, \" NFIB , 567 U.S. at 574 n.11, that was an authoritative determination re- garding what the text of the coverage requirement meant and what Congress intended. The majority pushes aside NFIB 's construction, act- ing as though the fact that the NFIB Court applied the 471 canon of constituti onal avoidance means that its inter- pretation no longer governs following the repeal of the shared -responsibility payment. But when the Court construes statutes, its \" interpretive decisions, in what- ever way reasoned , effectively become part of the stat- utory scheme, subject (just like the rest) to congressional change. \" Kimble v. Marvel Entm 't, LLC, 135 S. Ct. 2401, 2409 (2015) (emphasis added). While Congress can change its mind and could have amended the coverage requirement to turn the \" law- ful choice \" described by NFIB , 567 U.S. at 574, into an unwavering command, the majority does not suggest that Congress ever made such a choice. Sure, Congress amended the shared -responsibility payment in 2017. Yet as the district court went to great lengths to estab-lish and the majority is elsewhere eager to point out, the coverage requirement and the shared -responsibil- ity payment are distinct provisions. See Maj. Op. at 19 (\"To bring a claim against the [coverage requirement], therefore, the plaintiffs needed to show inj ury from the individual mandate \u2014not from the shared responsibil- ity payment. \"); Texas v. United States, 340 F. Supp. 3d 579, 596 (N.D. Tex. 2018) ( \"It is critical to clarify some- thing at the the shared -responsibility pay- ment, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 [coverage requirement], id. \u00a7 5000A(a). \"). And Con- gress did not touch the text of the coverage require-ment when it amended the shared -responsibility payment. See Budget Fiscal Year, 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-97, \u00a7 5000A(a) (2011). At risk of stating the obvious, if the text of the coverage requirement has not changed, its meaning could not have changed either. By \" giv[ing] these same words a different meaning, \" the majority \"invent[s] a statute rather than interpret[s] one. \" Clark , 543 U.S. at 378. 472 The majority is thus left on unsteady ground: amendment by implication, which \" will not be pre- sumed unless the legislature 's intent is ' clear and manifest. '\" In re Lively , 717 F.3d 406, 410 (5th Cir. 2013) (quoting Nat 'l Ass' n of Home Builders v. Defs. of Wildlife , 551 U.S. 644, 662 (2007)); see also, e.g. , Epic Sys. Corp. v. , 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1624 (2018) ( \"[I]n approaching a claimed conflict, we come armed with the 'stron[g] presum[ption] ' that repeals by implication are 'disfavored' and that ' Congress will specifically ad- dress ' preexisting law when it wishes to suspend its normal operations in a later statute. \" (second and third alterations in original) (quoting United States v. Fausto , 484 U.S. 439, 452-53 (1988))). This rule oper- ates with equal force when a judicial construction pre- viously illuminated the meaning of the purportedly amended statute. See TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Grp. Brands LLC, 137 S. Ct. 1514, 1520 (2017) (\"When Congress in tends to effect a change of [a stat- ute's earlier judicial interpretation], it ordinarily pro- vides a relatively clear indication of its intent in the text of the amended provision. \"); Midlantic Nat 'l Bank v. N.J. Dep 't of Prot. , 474 U.S. 494, 501 (19 86) (\"The normal rule of statutory construction is that if Congress intends for legislation to change the inter-pretation of a judicially created concept, it makes that intent specific. \"); cf. Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass'n , 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) ( \"Congre ss, we have held, does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions \u2014it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\" ). Congress's silence on the matter is thus conclusive. Yet even if one probes further, it boggles the mind to suggest that Congress intended to turn a non- mandatory provision into a mandatory provision by 473 doing away with the only means of incentivizing com- pliance with that provision. Congress quite plainly in- tended to relieve individuals of the burden the coverage requirement put on them; it did not intend to increase that burden. And if it did, it certainly did not make that intent \"clear and manifest. \" Lively , 717 F.3d at 410. Moreover, the considerations that led the NFIB Court to conclude that Congress did not intend the coverage requirement to impose a legal command to purchase health insurance are even more compelling in the absence of the shared -responsibility payment. Whereas before the only \" negative legal consequence[] to not buying health insurance \" was the payment of a tax, NFIB , 567 U.S. at 567- 68, now there are no con- sequences at all . And as the Congressional Budget Of- fice (\"CBO \") has predicted, without the shared - responsibility payment, most applicable individuals will n ot maintain health insurance solely for the pur- pose of obeying the coverage requirement. See Cong. Budget Office, Repealing the Individual Health Insur-ance Mandate: An Updated Estimate at 1 (2017). \"That Congress apparently regards such extensive failure t o comply with the [coverage requirement] as tolerable suggests that Congress did not think it was creating [millions of] outlaws. \" NFIB , 567 U.S. at 568. Ergo, when Congress zeroed -out the shared -re- sponsibility payment without amending the coverage require ment, it did not do away with the lawful choice it previously offered applicable individuals; it simply changed the parameters of that choice. Under the old scheme, applicable individuals could lawfully choose between maintaining health insurance and paying a tax. Under the new scheme, applicable individuals can lawfully choose between maintaining health insur- ance and doing nothing. In other words, the coverage 474 requirement is a dead letter \u2014it functions as an ex- pression of national policy or words of encoura gement, at most. Accordingly, although I would not reach the merits, I would reverse if I did. IV. I agree with much of what the majority has to say about the district court's severability ruling. But I fail to understand the logic behind remanding this ca se for a do-over. Severability is a question of law that this court can review de novo. And the answer here is quite simple \u2014indeed, a severability analysis will rarely be easier. After all, \"[o]ne determines what Congress would have done by examining what it did, \" and Con- gress declawed the coverage requirement without re- pealing any other part of the ACA. Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez , 531 U.S. (2001) (Scalia, J., dis- senting); see also Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of N. New Eng. , 546 U.S. 320, 330 (2006) ( \"[T]he touchstone for [severability analysis] is legislative intent. \"). Con- sequently, little guesswork is needed to determine that Congress believed the ACA could stand in its en- tirety without the unenforceable coverage require-ment. The majority s uggests that remand is necessary be- cause the district court \"has many tools at its disposal \" and is thus \"best positioned to undertake \" the severa- bility inquiry. Maj. Op. at 60. It is true that the district court is better able to assess factual issues tha n appel- late judges, because it can hold evidentiary hearings, but I cannot see how that could be relevant, since sev- erability is a question of law that we review de novo. Further, it is not clear what sort of evidence the district court could receive that would be useful when deciding severability questions except perhaps legislative his-tory, a source which the majority derides. See Maj. Op. 475 at 56 n.45 ( \"[W]e caution against relying on individual statements by legislators to determine the meaning of the law.\"). When it comes to analyzing the statute 's text and historical context, see id. , we are just as com- petent as the district court. There is thus no reason to prolong the uncertainty this litigation has caused to the future of this indubitably significant statute. 12 A. Before I address the more specific problems with the district court 's inseverability ruling, some back- ground on the ACA is in order. Congress passed the ACA in 2010 to address a growing crisis of Americans living without health insurance. Prio r to the ACA, nearly 50 million Americans (about 15 percent of the population at the time) were uninsured. Florida ex rel. Att'y Gen. U.S. Dep 't of Health & Human Servs. , 648 F.3d 1235, 1244 (11th Cir. 2011), rev'd on other grounds , NFIB , 567 U.S. 519. Alt hough many large employers provided health insurance, coverage was of-ten cost prohibitive for small businesses and consum- ers seeking insurance through the individual market (i.e., directly instead of through an employer). See U.S. Gov't Accountability Offi ce, GAO- 12-166R, Health Care Coverage: Job Lock and the Potential Impact of 12 The majority also suggests that remand is necessary so that the district court can consider remedial issues, raised by the United States for the first time on appeal, regarding the appro-priate scope of relief. But such issues are largely moot if, as I be-lieve, the coverage requirement is completely severable from the rest of the ACA. For example, I do not perceive a meaningful dif- ference between a nationwide injunction prohibiting enforcement of the already -unenforceable coverage requirement versus an in- junction against enforcement that is limited to the plaintiff states. In any case, this court could \u2014and, in my view, should \u2014 resolve the severability issue even if remanding remedial issues is appropriate. 476 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 3-4 (2011). Moreover, insurance companies could \u2014and regularly would \u2014deny coverage to high -risk consum- ers, especially those with preex isting medical condi- tions. Id. at 4. The pre -ACA status quo created numerous eco- nomic and social problems. Most obviously, America 's uninsured population could not afford spiraling healthcare costs, thus exacerbating health problems, leading to an estimate d 45,000 premature deaths an- nually, Andrew P. Wilper et al., Health Insurance and Mortality in US Adults , 99 Am. J. Pub. Health 2289, 2292 (2009), and causing \" 62 percent of all personal bankruptcies, \" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091(2)(G). The uninsured crisis caused some subtler problems too. For one thing, hospitals would have to absorb the costs of treating uninsured patients and would inevitably pass those costs along to insurance companies, which would then pass them along to consumers. See \u00a7 18091(2)(F) ( \"The cost of providing uncompensated care to the uninsured was $43,000,000,000 in 2008. To pay for this cost, health care providers pass on the cost to private insur-ers, which pass on the cost to families. \"). See generally Amicus Br. of HCA Healthcare, Inc. at 9 -13. And de- pendency on employer -based healthcare decreased la- bor mobility, discouraged entrepreneurship, and kept potential caregivers away from the home. See GAO -12- 166R, supra , at 5 -6. In enacting the ACA, Congress sought to address these and other problems with the national healthcare system by drastically reducing the number of unin- sured and underinsured Americans. To achieve this goal, the ACA undertook a series of reforms, most no- tably to the individual insurance market. See gener-ally Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. 477 L. No. 111 -148, tit. I, 124 Stat. 119 (2010). Among the ACA' s most important (and visible) reforms are two related provisions: guaranteed issue and community rate. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300gg, 300gg -1. The guaranteed- issue provisio n requires health -insurance providers to accept every individual who applies for coverage, thus preventing insurers from denying coverage based on a consumer' s preexisting medical condition. See \u00a7 300gg - 1(a). The community -rate provision prevents insurers from charging a higher rate because of a policyholder 's medical condition. See \u00a7 300gg(a). Left without some counterbalance, the guaranteed - issue and community -rate provisions threatened to overload insurers ' risk pools with high -risk policyhold- ers. Beyond allowing more high -risk consumers to purchase health insurance (as intended), these provi-sions disincentivized healthy (i.e., low risk) consumers from purchasing health insurance because it allowed them to wait until they developed costly health prob-lems to purchase insurance. 13 This would have caused premiums to skyrocket, exacerbating many of the problems Congress sought to solve. See generally Ami-cus Br. of Blue Cross Blue Shield Ass'n at 3-4. Thus, the ACA included several provisions to incentivize low - risk consumers to purchase health insurance. It of-fered tax credits to offset much of the cost of health insurance for middle -income consumers. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 36B(b). It created healthcare exchanges to facilitate competition among health plans and to lower transac- tion costs. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18031, 18041. It limited new enrollments to an open -enrollment period set by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, which mitigates the adverse -selection problem by preventing consumers from purchasing health insurance only 13 This is known as the adverse -selection problem. 478 when they need it. See \u00a7 18031(c)(6). And it included the coverage requirement at issue in this lawsuit. See \u00a7 5000A(a). Although the coverage requirement has been among the ACA 's best -known provisions, the ACA 's re- forms to the private insurance market extend well be- yond it. As just mentioned, Congress created other mechanisms to achieve the same goal as the coverage requirement: incentivize low -risk consumers to pur- chase health insurance. The ACA also included other provisions expanding access t o the private insurance market, including a requirement that employers with 50 or more employees offer health insurance, see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4980H, and a requirement that health -insur- ance providers allow young adults to remain on their parents ' insurance until they turn 26, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg -14. And it included provisions designed to make health -insurance policies more attractive, such as those directly regulating premiums, see, e.g. , id. \u00a7 300gg -18(b), limiting benefits caps, see 300gg 11, and prescr ibing certain minimum- coverage re- quirements for health plans, see, e.g., id. \u00a7 300gg -13. Moreover, the ACA contains countless other provisions that are unrelated to the private insurance market \u2014 and many that are only tangentially related to health insuranc e at all. 14 The following are only some of many possible examples: Section 3006, which directs the Sec- retary of Health and Human Ser- vices to \" develop a plan to 14 The ACA contains ten titles. Only the first title focuses on the private insurance industry. The other titles address wide -rang- ing topics from the \"prevention of chronic disease,\" ACA tit. IV, to the \"health care work force,\" id. tit. V. 479 implement a value -based purchas- ing program for payments under the Medicare program . . . for skil led nursing facilities. \" Section 4205, which requires chain restaurants to conspicuously dis- play \"the number of calories con- tained . menu item[s]. \" Section 5204, which creates a stu-dent- loan repayment assistance program \"to eliminate critic al pub- lic health workforce shortages in Federal, State, local and tribal pub- lic health agencies.\" Section 6402, which, among other things, strengthens criminal laws prohibiting healthcare fraud. Title III of Part X, which reauthor- izes and amends the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, a decades - old statute creating and maintain-ing the infrastructure for tribal healthcare services. Given the breadth of the ACA and the importance of the problems that Congress set out to address, it is simply unfathomable to me that Congress hinged the future of the entire statute on the viability of a single, deliberately unenforceable provision. 15 15 I do not mean to suggest that, as a policy matter, Congress chose the best (or even worthwhile) solutions to these prob lems. 480 B. In Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, the Court announced the three principles that must guide our severability analysi s. \"First, we try not to nullify more of a legislature' s work than is necessary, for we know that ' [a] ruling of unconstitutionality frus- trates the intent of the elected representatives of the people. '\" Planned Parenthood of N. New Eng. , 546 U.S. at 329 (alteration in original) (quoting Regan v. Time, Inc., 468 U.S. 641, 652 (1984) (plurality opinion)). \"Second, mindful that our constitutional mandate and institutional competence are limited, we restrain our-selves from ' rewrit[ing] [a] law to conform it to consti- tutional requirements ' even as we strive to salvage it. \" Id. (first alteration in original) (quoting Am. Booksellers, 484 U.S. at 397). \" Third, the touchstone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent, for a court cannot 'use its remedial powers to circumvent the intent of the legislature. '\" Id. at 330 (quoting Cali- fano v. Westcott , 443 U.S. 76, 94 (1979) (Powell, J., con- curring in part and dissenting in part)). In accordance with these principles, the Court 's cases suggest a two-part inquir y. First, we must ask \"whether the law remains ' fully operative ' without the invalid provisions. \" Murphy v. NCAA, 138 S. Ct. 1461, 1482 (2018); see also United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 258 -59 (2005); Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock , 480 U.S. 678, 684 (1987). If so, the remaining provisions are \"presumed severable\" from the invalid provision. Chadha , 462 U.S. at 934 (quoting Champlin Ref. Co. Such matters are beyond my job description, so I express no opin- ion on them. But the district court should have thought more crit-ically about whether Congress likely intended to leave its chosen solution to a serious problem so vulnerable to judicial invalida- tion. 481 v. Corp. Comm 'n, 286 U.S. 210, 234 (1932)). This pre- sumption is rebutted only if \" the statute 's text or his- torical context makes it 'evident' that Congress, faced with the limitations imposed by the Constitution, would have preferred \" no statute over the statute with only the permissible provisions. Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 47 7, 509 (2010). And as should be clear by now, \" the 'normal rule' is 'that partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the required course.'\" Id. at 508 (quoting Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc. , 472 U.S. 491, 504 (1985)). 1. The majority has identified the most glaring flaw in the district court 's severability analysis: the district court \"gives relatively little attention to the intent of the 2017 Congress, which appears in the analysis only as an afterthought. \" When one takes this fact into ac- count, the re can be little doubt as to Congress 's intent. We have unusual insight into Congress's thinking because Congress was given a chance to weigh in on the ACA' s future without an effective coverage re- quirement and it decided the ACA should remain in place. By zeroing out the shared -responsibility pay- ment, the 2017 Congress left the coverage require-ment unenforceable. If Congress viewed the coverage requirement as so essential to the rest of the ACA that it intended the entire statute to rise and fall with the coverage requirement, it is inconceivable that Con- gress would have declawed the coverage requirement as it did. And make no mistake: Congress declawed the coverage requirement. As the CBO found only a month before Congress passed the TCJA, \"[i]f the [coverage re- quirement] penalty was eliminated but the [coverage requirement] itself was not repealed, the results would be very similar to\" if the coverage requirement 482 itself were repealed. 2017 CBO Report, supra , at 1. Re- gardless of lofty civic notions about people who follow the law for the sake of following the law, the objective evidence before Congress was that \" only a small num- ber of people\" would obey the coverage requirement without the shared -responsibility payment. Id. ; cf. Dep't of Commerce, 139 S. Ct. at 2565- 66 (concluding people will \" predictabl[y] \" \"violate their legal duty \" when incentivized to do so). Congress accordingly knew that repealing the shared -responsibility pay- ment would have the same essential effect on the ACA' s statutory scheme as wou ld repealing the cover- age requirement. Furthermore, as various amici highlight, judicial repeal of the ACA would have potentially devastating effects on the national healthcare system and the economy at large. See, e.g. , Amicus Br. of Am. 's Health Ins. Pla ns (discussing impact on health -insurance in- dustry); Amicus Br. of 35 Counties, Cities, and Towns (discussing impact on municipalities); Amicus Br. of Bipartisan Econ. Scholars (discussing impact on econ- omy); Amicus Br. of Am. Hosp. Ass 'n et al. (discussin g impact on hospitals). Regardless of whether the ACA is good or bad policy, it is undoubtedly significant pol- icy. It is unlikely that Congress would want a statute on which millions of people rely for their healthcare and livelihoods to disappear overnigh t with the wave of a judicial wand. If Congress wanted to repeal the ACA through the deliberative legislative process, it could have done so. But with the stakes so high, it is difficult to imagine that this is a matter Congress in-tended to turn over to th e judiciary. 2. A second flaw in the district court 's analysis is the great weight it places on the fact that Congress in 2017 483 did not repeal its statutory findings emphasizing the coverage requirement 's importance to the guaranteed - issue and community -rate provisions. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18091. The district court overread the significance of \u00a7 18091. Congress enacted the findings in \u00a7 18091 to demonstrate the coverage requirement 's role in regu- lating interstate commerce. When it invokes its com- merce power, Con gress routinely makes such findings to facilitate judicial review. See United States v. Mor-rison , 529 U.S. 598, 612 (2000) (\"While 'Congress nor- mally is not required to make formal findings as to the substantial burdens that an activity has on inter- state commerce, ' the existence of such findings may 'enable us to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affect[s] inter-state commerce, even though no such substantial ef-fect [is] visible to the naked eye. '\" (alterat ions in original) (citation omitted) (quoting United States v. Lopez , 514 U.S. 549, 562- 63 (1995))). Indeed, \u00a7 18091(2), the subsection the district court focused its attention on, is entitled \" Effects on the national econ- omy and interstate commerce. \" Section 18091 is not an inseverability clause, and nothing in its text suggests that Congress intended to make the coverage requirement inseverable from the remainder of the ACA. If Congress intended to draft an inseverability clause, it knew how to do so. See Of- fice of Legislative Counsel, U.S. Senate, Senate Legis- lative Drafting Manual \u00a7 131(b) (1997) (explaining purpose of inseverability clause). Compare id. \u00a7 131(c) (providing as example of proper form for inseverability clause: \" EFFECT OF INVALIDITY ON OT HER PRO- VISIONS OF ACT. \u2014If section 501, 502, or 503 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (as added by this section) or any part of those sections is held to be invalid, all provisions of and amendments made by 484 this Act shall be invalid \"), with \u00a7 18091(2)(H) (\" The re- quirement is an essential part of this larger regulation of economic activity, and the absence of the require- ment would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance market. \"). In fact, both the House and the Senate legislative draft ing guides suggest that Con- gress should include an inseverability clause if it wants to make a statute inseverable because \" [t]he Su- preme Court has made it quite clear that invalid por- tions of statutes are to be severed ' unless it is evident that the Legis lature would not have enacted those pro- visions which are within its powers, independently of that which is not.'\" Office of Legislative Counsel, U.S. House of Representatives, House Legislative Coun- sel's Manual on Drafting Style \u00a7 328 (1995) (quoting Chadh a, 462 U.S. at 931); accord Senate Legislative Drafting Manual, supra , at \u00a7 131(a). The absence of a genuine inseverability clause should be all but conclu- sive in assessing the legislature 's intent. Moreover, the argument that \u00a7 18091 is meant to signal Co ngress 's intent that the coverage require- ment be inseverable proves far too much. Sec-tion 18091 discusses the coverage requirement 's importance to the entire federal healthcare regulatory scheme, including \u2014along with the ACA \u2014the Public Health Service Act ( \"PHSA \") and the Employee Re- tirement \"ERISA\" ). See \u00a7 18091(2)(H) ( \"Under the Employee In- come Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), and this Act, the Federal Government has a significant role in regulating health insurance. The [coverage] re- quirement is an essential part of this larger regulation of economic activity, and the absence of the require- ment would undercut Federal regulation of the health 485 insurance marke t.\" (emphasis added)). It is not sug- gested that Congress intended a court to strike down the PHSA and ERISA if it found the coverage require- ment unconstitutional. This would be especially im-plausible given the intensity of the debate over the coverage requ irement' s constitutionality from the get- go. See NFIB , 567 U.S. at 540 ( \"On the day the Presi- dent signed the [ACA] into law, Florida and 12 other States filed a complaint in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Florida. \"). Yet in signali ng that the coverage requirement is \" an essential part of this larger regulation, \" Congress did not distinguish between the ACA and these prior statutes. Thus, \u00a7 18091 cannot reasonably be read to bear on the cov- erage requirement 's severability. 3. Another flaw in the district court 's analysis is its suggestion that the Supreme Court concluded in NFIB and King v. Burwell , 135 S. Ct. 2480 (2015), that the coverage requirement is inseverable from the ACA's guaranteed- issue and community -rate provisions. The district court misconstrued these opinions. And even if the district court read them correctly, these opinions address the coverage requirement as enforced by the shared -responsibility payment. They give little valua- ble insight into the coverage requirement's role in the post-TCJA ACA. In NFIB , only the dissenters addressed the cover- age requirement 's severability. The district court did not suggest it is bound by a Supreme Court dissent, and of course it is not. The district court instead took language from the other five Justices out of context to conclude that each of them viewed the coverage re- quirement as inseverable. But none of the language the district court cited addresses severability. See 486 NFIB , 567 U.S. at 547 -48 (opinion of Roberts, C.J.) (discussi ng Government 's argument that coverage re- quirement plays a role in regulating interstate com- merce); id. at 597 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting in part) (same). Although the Justices ' reasoning certainly sug- gests that they saw the coverage requirement as an impor tant part of the statutory scheme as it existed in 2012, this does not mean the Justices found it \"evident\" that Congress would have preferred the entire statute to fall without the coverage requirement. Alaska Air-lines , 480 U.S. at 684. King likewise contains some helpful commentary about the ACA 's original statutory scheme, but it does not discuss severability or otherwise control the sever- ability analysis. The Court ruled in King that the ACA' s tax credits were available to every eligible con- sumer regard less of whether the state in which a con- sumer lived established its own exchange or relied on the federally operated exchange. 135 S. Ct. at 2496. The coverage requirement came up because many more individuals would have been exempt from the shared -respons ibility payment if tax credits were not available to them. Id. at 2493- 95; see also \u00a7 to . . . [a]ny applicable individual for any month if the applicable individual' s required contribu- tion (d etermined on an annual basis) for coverage for the month exceeds 8 percent of such individual 's house- hold income . . . .\" ). 16 Noting the importance of the tax 16 Lest there be any confusion, the exemption at issue in King ex- empted individuals otherwise subject to the coverage requirement from the shared -responsibility payment; it did not exempt them from the coverage requirement itself. Exemptions from the shared -responsibility payment are listed in \u00a7 5000A(e)(1), 487 credits and coverage requirement (as enforced by the shared -responsibility payment) to the statuto ry struc- ture, the Court concluded as a matter of statutory in- terpretation that Congress did not intend a scheme in which neither tax credits nor the coverage require- ment were operating to bring low- risk consumers into the insurance pools. See King , 135 S. Ct. at 2492- 94 (\"The combination of no tax credits and an ineffective coverage requirement could well push a State' s indi- vidual insurance market into a death spiral. . . . It is implausible that Congress meant the [ACA] to operate in this manner. \"). The district court framed King as saying that Con- gress intrinsically tied the community -rate and guar- anteed- issue provisions to the coverage requirement, meaning that those provisions must be inseverable from the coverage requirement. But the district court ignored a crucial aspect of the King Court 's analysis: it explicitly discussed the coverage requirement as en- forced by the shared -responsibility payment. See id. at 2493 (referring to the coverage requirement as \" a re- quirement that individuals maintain health insurance coverage or make a payment to the IRS \" (emphasis added)). Indeed, as the Court identified it, the crux of the problem with denying consumers tax credits in fed- eral-exchange states was that doing so would make a large number of individuals unable to afford insur-ance, thus exempting them from the shared -responsi- bility payment. See id. These widespread exemptions would, in turn, make the coverage requirement \"inef- fective.\" Id. King thus speaks far more to the shared - responsibility payment 's role in t he ACA' s pre -TCJA whereas exemptions from the coverage requirement itself are listed in \u00a7 5000A(d). 488 statutory scheme than it does the coverage require- ment' s role in the statutory scheme. Even to the extent the Court in NFIB or King meant to opine on the coverage requirement 's severa- bility, these cases were both decided before the TCJA. They thus give no insight into how the coverage re- quirement fits into the post- TCJA scheme. Whatever reservations the Court previously harbored about sev- ering the coverage requirement, Congress plainly did not share those concerns when it zeroed out the shared-responsibility payment. Congress either con- cluded that healthcare markets under the ACA had reached a point of stability at which they no longer needed an effective coverage requirement, 17 or it chose to accept the negative side effects of effectively repeal-ing the coverage requirement as a cost of relieving the burden it placed on applicable individuals. Either way, the legislative considerations have necessarily shifted. In sum, there was no reason for the district court to conclude that any provision in the ACA was inse- verable from the coverage requirement. The majority does not necessarily disagree. I thus do not understand its decision to remand when, even on the majority 's analysis of the case, it could instead reverse and ren- der a judgment declari ng only the coverage require- ment unconstitutional. 17 See CBO Report, supra , at 1 (concluding that \"[n]ongroup insur- ance markets would continue to be stable in almost all areas of the country throughout the coming decade\" if the coverage re- quirement were repealed); Amicus Br. of Blue Cross Blue Shield Ass'n at 24-27 (explaining that tax credits and other ACA provi-sions are driving enough consumers into insuranc e markets to make the coverage requirement unnecessary). 489 V. Limits on judicial power demand special respect in a case like this. For one thing, careless judicial inter- ference has the potential to be especially pernicious when it involves a complex statute like the ACA, which carries such significant implications for the welfare of the economy and the American populace at large. For another, the legitimacy of the judicial branch as a countermajoritarian institution in an otherwise demo- cratic system depends on its ability to operate with re- straint\u2014and especially so in a high -profile case such as the one at bar. The district court 's opinion is text- book judicial overreach. The majority perpetuates that overreach and, in remanding, ensures that no end for this litigat ion is in sight.
