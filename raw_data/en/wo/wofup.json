The secondar y Plan is the Plan of the parent whose bi rthday falls later in the year . b) if both parents have the same bir thday , the benefi ts of the Plan which covered t he parent the longer time is the primary Plan; th e Plan whi ch cove red the parent the sh orter time is the secondary Plan. c) if the other P lan does not h ave the birthday rule, but has the male \\female rule and if, as a result , the Plans do not agr ee on the order of benefits, the rule in the other Plan will determine the order of benefits. 4. Dependent Child: Separ ated or Divorced Pare nts: If two o r mo re Plans cover a person as a depe ndent child of divorced or separated par ents, benefi ts for the chi ld are deter mine d as foll ows: a) first, the P lan of the parent with custo dy of t he child; b) then, th e Plan of the sp ouse or Domestic P artner of the p arent w ith custody of the child; and c) finally, the Plan of the parent witho ut cus tody of the chil d. However, if the specific terms of a court decree state that one par ent is responsi ble for the health care expenses of t he child and the en tity obligate d to pay or pr ovide the benefits of the Plan of that parent has actual knowle dge of those terms, that Plan is the pri mary Plan.

The s econdary Plan i s the Plan which covers that person as a laid off or retired Covered Per son (or a s that Cov ered Person's depend ent).
