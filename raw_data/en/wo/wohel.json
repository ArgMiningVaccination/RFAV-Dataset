Chandler, ND, MPA:HA, MSOM, LAc](https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/200408-loch-s-chandler?region=or) With an emphasis on positive and proactive health management, Providence Integrative Medicine Program offers an excellent complement to conventional medicine. As part of the multidisciplinary treatment model at Providence Health & Services, our naturopathic physicians work alongside a patient's other care team members. The goal of integrative medicine is to help patients achieve optimal health, even in situations where they simply don't feel well, but don't have a diagnosis. Providence Integrative Medicine Program providers use therapies that are supported by modern medical research. Our expert clinicians are trained to provide treatment that is current, safe and evidence-based. Modern research supports the use of complementary medicine to treat conditions such as: - Side effects of cancer treatment - Chronic pain syndromes - Insomnia - Skin disorders - Heartburn, ulcers and esophageal reflux - Irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease - Weight problems - High cholesterol - High blood pressure - Metabolic syndrome, high blood sugars and type 2 diabetes - Arthritis - Allergies - Asthma - Sinusitis Because we take time to get to know you as a whole person, we are able to provide reasonable and appropriate naturopathic care that is tailored to your individual health needs. Offerings include therapeutic, acupuncture, naturopathy and dietary counseling. - Acupuncture - Chiropractic medicine - Dietary counseling - Naturopathy - Stress reduction - Therapeutic massage Providers may refer you to our clinic. However, no referrals are needed to make an appointment with our providers. Please check with your insurance company to see whether naturopathic medicine, acupuncture or massage is included in your plan prior to scheduling an appointment with our providers. The cost of a visit depends mainly on two things - the complexity of the visit and the length of the visit. Given that many insurance plans now cover integrative medicine, you may only have a copay at the time of visit. Check with your insurance company whether naturopathic medicine, acupuncture or massage is included in your plan. A self-pay discount for is available for massage services and some acupuncture services. If you have questions about self-pay or services offered, please call us directly at the number listed above. We treat anyone. As we are housed in the Cancer Center, many of our patients also have cancer. We regard ourselves as specialists, and because of that we do not consider ourselves to be PCPs. We believe in integrated care, and encourage people to have an established PCP. However, we would greatly appreciate being a part of your health care team. We leave the prescribing of narcotics to a patient's primary care provider or pain management specialist. We focus on diet and lifestyle interventions, including acupuncture and massage, to help you reduce your pain and inflammation. Medical marijuana is not currently a part of the Naturopathic formulary. As a result, we cannot currently prescribe medical marijuana. Yes, our Naturopaths can order the same labs that a conventional provider could order. Yes! We believe the best care is integrated care where providers communicate freely about how best to help you, the patient. Just let us know what your goals and expectations are. With our current level of data, or science, on non-conventional therapies, we don't have anything (supplement, herb, remedy, therapy, etc.) that has been found to be effective against any cancer by itself as a standalone treatment. In other words, we don't have the \"Silver Bullet\" of cure. However, we do have many things with anticancer properties. We like to look at the whole person to see what recommendations we can make with regards to diet, lifestyle and supplements or herbs, in order to help them achieve more optimal health and healing. This involves an individualized approach with every patient receiving customized treatments and recommendations. We like to call it \"Silver Buckshot,\" and there is much stronger science on these approaches. Yes. We can support you however you would like to be supported with whatever your health care choices are. When you first hear the words \"it's cancer,\" the road ahead may seem overwhelming. But from that moment on, Providence Cancer Institute surrounds you with people to help you through the journey.
