What I think a lot of people don't know about homeopathy is that when we talk about healing, we're talking about whole-person healing. This means not just treating symptoms that cause us physical discomfort or pain, but rather we are addressing the root of those symptoms. Though physical symptoms are often something we feel acutely, the root to those symptoms is most likely happening on a deeper plane \u2014 the mental, emotional, or spiritual plane. This is why it's important for your homeopath and YOU to understand and become conscious of what you are experiencing; thoughts, feelings, even dreams! We spend a lot of time in patterns. This isn't a bad thing, it's part of being human, but when we are mentally, emotionally, or even our physical bodies are stuck in a pattern, it makes it difficult to heal. The first step to interrupting a pattern it to become conscious of it. What I love about homeopathy is that it helps us bring patterns to consciousness by two means: the intake and follow-ups, and the remedies themselves. The purpose of a homeopathic intake is to gain a thorough understanding of how you individually experience your symptoms, \u2014 how your pain feels to you, how you experience stress, what sorts of practices make you feel better, etc. \u2014 through this you are expressing your experience while someone listens deeply and tries to understand how your symptoms feel to you. In homeopathy, the belief is that your symptoms are the deepest expression of what needs healing. \"Homeopathy\" literally means \"like cures like.\" With \"homeo\" meaning \"similar\" and \"pathy\" meaning \"suffering.\" Through the intake, your homeopath is perceiving the energy of your unique life-force, then a remedy is chosen (from nature, ethically sourced from a plant, mineral, or animal) that matches your energetic frequency to facilitate a healing response. It's kind of like lovingly holding up a mirror and saying \"hey, something needs to change here.\" Homeopathic remedies deeply support all systems while gently nudging the life-force back into homeostasis. Essentially, the entire homeopathic treatment process is about bringing our suffering to consciousness to open up space for healing. It's the opposite of suppression which would be working against our symptoms. Each and every one of us has experienced varying levels of suffering, whether we perceive them to be great or small, acute or chronic. Holding space for our suffering, sitting with it, reflecting on it, journaling about it, are all ways we can become conscious of what's ailing us and facilitate healing. Yes! You can practice this deep healing on your own by holding space for yourself! Take some time to sit with your symptoms, try closing your eyes and paying attention to sensations. Where do you feel them? How do they feel? Is there a specific time you feel them getting better or worse? If it helps (like it does me) try journaling about what is coming up, this can really help ground ourselves and allow us to gain a better understanding of our own experience and what our life force is expressing. As always, remember to be gentle with yourself in this process. Sometimes just the practice of holding space for ourselves can bring up potent emotions, memories, or sensations. Stay with the discomfort, and hold yourself in unconditional love. If you are feeling ready to dive into this more deeply, I encourage you to lean into that!
