Chronic toxicity and car cinogenicity studies are intended to identify toxic effects and potential health hazards following prolonged, repeated exposure. This type of study is usually required if humans are likely to be exposed to a substance over a significant portion of their li fe span. In the 1960s, long -term animal bioassays (chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies) began to be routinely used for hazard identification, to assess the qualitative potential of a chemical to cause chronic toxicity and cancer. 2. The objectives o f the long -term bioassays have however expanded beyond hazard identification and are now focused primarily on hazard characterization for use in the assessment of risk for humans. In addition there has been increasing pressure for the long term bioassay de signs to consider financial constraints and societal desires to minimize the number of animals needed for scientific interpretation of results. There is a growing desire for long -term studies to provide data that cover a number of objectives including char acterization of the nature of specific toxic responses, description of dose - response relationship, establishment of inflection points, and provision of insight into the roles of toxicokinetics and mechanisms of toxic action. In practice, it is likely that the bioassay design will be a compromise among a set of different purposes; to the extent that the ability to address one question is enhanced, the ability to address others may be diminished. For example, it may be necessary to achieve a balance between t he power to detect toxicity and the ability to estimate the dose -response relationship of any observed effects. If information on carcinogenicity hazard identification is not available, this should be the main objective of the study. 3. The use of formal risk assessment procedures by government regulatory bodies began to emerge in the late 1970s and early 1980s bringing with it a strong interest in using data for quantitative as well as qualitative purposes. The need to gather data that allowed an understandin g of the shape and slope of the dose -response curve focused attention on the number of doses in a bioassay and their spacing. Advances in knowledge of how chemicals perturbed or otherwise modulated biological processes in the development of tumors or other forms of toxicity provided bases for further improving the risk assessment process. Through meetings held primarily under the auspices of the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS), a Mode of Action (MOA) framework was developed and refined (S onnich -Mullin et al., 2001; Cohen et al., 2003; Meek et al., 2003; Holsapple et al., 2006; Boobis et al., 2006; EPA, 2005), as will be further developed in Chapter 2 of this guidance. The key purpose of this work was to introduce greater transparency into the process of assessing human relevance, and the goal was to use a broad array of relevant data to determine the predictive value of a bioassay tumor response to risk in humans. 4. The broadened range and complexity of scientific data used to evaluate chem ical toxicity and carcinogenicity potential for humans highlighted the need to revise and update the following OECD Test Guidelines (TGs): TG 451 (Carcinogenicity Studies), TG 452 (Chronic Toxicity Studies), and TG 453 (Combined Chronic Toxicity/Carcinoge nicity Studies), originally adopted in 1981. These TGs have therefore recently been revised in the light of scientific progress and the updating of 4 related OECD Guidelines such as TG 408 (90 -day oral toxicity study in rodents) and TG 407 (28 -day oral toxic ity study in rodents). 5. During the revision of the Test Guidelines, an emphasis was placed on providing guidance on factors that influence the selection of test doses, particularly for carcinogenicity studies. It was recognized that while general principles of dose selection should be contained in the Test Guidelines themselves, there was a need for additional guidance on these principles. The revision took into account two publications by the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), Principles for the Selection of Doses in Chronic Rodent Bioassays\" (ILSI, 1997), and Issues in the Design and Interpretation of Chronic Toxicity and Carcinogenicity Studies in Rodents: Approaches to Dose Selection (Rhomberg et al., 2007) These reports provided theoretical and practical guidance on factors that influence dose selection in chronic bioassays. 6. A summary of the principles contained in these two publications, to underpin the texts on dose selection contained in the Test Guidelines, is provided in this guidance (Section 3.1, Appendix 1). During the development of this material, suggestions were made for additional guidance on specific aspects of study design in relation to core objectives of these studies, and how they might impact on other aspects of the study (e.g., designing for optimal collection of carcinogenicity data versus chronic toxicity data, design of studies for risk estimation rather than hazard assessment). It was generally agreed that the scope of the guidance should be wider than principles of do se selection, and should cover a number of key issues related to carcinogenicity and chronic toxicity testing. 7. This guidance therefore provides additional information on the conduct of studies performed using TG 451, 452 and TG 453. Its objective is to assist users of the TGs to select the most appropriate methodology to assess the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of a test chemical so that particular data requirements can be met while reducing animal usage if possible/appropriate. 8. The guidance i s intended to foster a common approach among those carrying out chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies , and thereby contributes to the harmonisation activities undertaken by the OECD and other agencies, such as the WHO1. It should be consulted in ad dition to other guidance and requirements documents. It provides broad guidance on approaches to the execution of chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. The text reflects current scientific understanding and standards. In time, the scientific commun ity will gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of toxicity, and this may lead to changes in both methodology and interpretation of results, which should reflect scientific consensus at the time data are reviewed. 9. It should be noted that the basi c principles for the conduct of chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies will differ, given that the endpoints are different. While the guidance provided in this document can be taken as generally applicable to the conduct 1 An example, already referred to, is the IPCS project Harmonisation of Approaches to the Assessment of Risk from Exposu re to Chemicals , which has developed a Conceptual Framework for Cancer Risk Assessment . The framework is an analytical tool for judging whether the available data support a postulated mode of carcinogenic action. 5 of either a chronic toxicity or a carcinogenicity bioassay, or a combined chronic and carcinogenicity study, users of the guidance should be mindful of the primary objectives of the study. It should also be noted that much of the information provided in the guidance reflects general principles for cond ucting animal studies , e.g. information on route of exposure and dosing considerations, choice of species and strain, the importance of toxicokinetic studies, housing and feeding and animal welfare issues, and is not unique , and is not unique to chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity studies. The objective in restating this general in formation in this guidance is to provide as far as possible a stand -alone document, avoiding the need for the reader to make cross reference between several g uidance documents covering different aspects of such studies. 10. Two other OECD documents also provide guidance on aspects of the conduct and interpretation of repeat -dose toxicity studies , chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies, Guidance Notes for An alysis and Evaluation of Repeat -Dose Toxicity Studies (OECD, 2002a) and Guidance Notes for Analysis and Evaluation of Chronic Toxicity and Carcinogenicity Studies (OECD, 2002b). The Guidance Notes for Analysis and Evaluation of Chronic Toxicity and Carcino genicity Studies (GD 35 ), provides valuable information on assessment of the quality, integrity, and completeness of the experimental data from chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies and determining the acceptability of the study reports, including a spects such as reliability, relevance and adequacy (OECD, 2002b). GD 35 also provides guidance on the reporting of the study and on the use of historical control data as an adjunct to the internal controls of the study in question. These aspects are there fore considered to lie outside the scope of the current Guidance Document, and GD 35 should be consulted for further information. 1.2 Scope of application of the guidance 11. The Test Guidelines 451, 452 and 453 and this guidance document are designed to be used in the testing of a wide range of chemicals, whatever their field of application, including pesticides, industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals. However, as noted in the Test Guideline 451, some testing requirements may differ for pharmaceuticals. The International Conference on Harmonisation of Testing for Pharmaceuticals (ICH) has produced a series of safety guidelines for the testing of pharmaceuticals, including guidelines on toxicokinetics (ICH, S3A), genotoxicity testing (ICH, S2), duration of chronic toxicity testing in animals (rodent and non -rodent toxicity testing) (ICH, M3(R2)), testing for carcinogenicity of pharmaceuticals (ICH, S1B) and dose selection for carcinogenicity studies of pharmaceuticals (ICH, S1C(R2)). These guidelines should al ways be consulted for specific guidance when testing pharmaceuticals using the approaches outlined in TG 451, 452 and 453. This guidance document provides, in various sections, examples of where the testing requirements may be different for pharmaceuticals . 1.3 Objectives of a chronic toxicity study 12. The objective of a chronic toxicity study, such as described by TG 452, is to characterise the toxicological response of a substance in a mammalian species 6 following prolonged and repeated exposure. The chronic toxicity study provides information on the possible health hazards likely to arise from repeated exposure over a prolonged period of time. Key objectives of the study are to provide information useful for classification and labelling and an estimate of a point of departure (e.g., the benchmark dose low level (BMDL) or the no -observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL)) for any adverse effects, which can be used for establishing safety criteria for human exposure. The study will provide information on the major t oxic effects, and indicate target organs, progressive toxic effects and the possibility of delayed toxicity. The need for careful clinical observations of the animals, so as to obtain as much information as possible, is also stressed. Previous repeated dos e 28-day and/or 90 -day toxicity tests on a chemical may, among others, have indicated the potential to cause neurotoxic/neurobehavioural effects, or effects on the endocrine system, warranting further in -depth investigation as part of a chronic toxicity st udy. 1.4 Objectives of a carcinogenicity study 13. The objective of a long -term carcinogenicity study, such as described by TG 451, is to observe test animals for a major portion of their life span for the development of neoplastic lesions during or afte r exposure to various doses of a test substance by an appropriate route of administration. The carcinogenicity study may also provide information on the possible health hazards likely to arise from repeated exposure for a period lasting up to the entire li fespan of the species used. The study will provide information on potential carcinogenicity, and may indicate toxic effects, target organs, progressive toxic effects and the possibility of delayed toxicity. It can provide information useful for classificat ion and labelling, and an estimate of a point of departure for toxic effects and, in the case of non -genotoxic carcinogens, for tumor responses, which can be used for establishing safety levels for human exposure. The need for careful clinical observations of the animals, so as to obtain as much information as possible, is also stressed. Such an assay requires careful planning and documentation of the experimental design, a high standard of pathology, and unbiased statistical analysis. These requirements ar e well known and have not undergone any significant changes in recent years. 1.5 Objectives of a combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study 14. The objective of a combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study, such as described by TG 453, is to det ermine the toxicological effects of a substance (including carcinogenic potential) in a mammalian species following prolonged and repeated exposure. The combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study provides information on the possible health hazards lik ely to arise from repeated exposure over the majority of the entire lifespan (in rodents) . The study will provide information on the major toxic effects of the substance including potential carcinogenicity, and indicate target organs, progressive toxic ef fects and the possibility of delayed toxicity . The need for careful clinical observations of the animals, so as to obtain as much information as possible, is also stressed. The application of the TG 453 should generate data on which to identify the majorit y of chronic and carcinogenic effects and to determine dose -response relationships. Ideally, the design and conduct should allow for the detection of 7 neoplastic effects and a determination of carcinogenic potential as well as general toxicity, including ne urological, physiological, biochemical, and haematological effects and exposure -related morphological (pathology) effects. 15. The design of the updated TG 453 recommends, for the chronic phase of the study, at least three dose groups and a control group, each group containing at least 10 males and 10 females per group. The reduction of the number of animals per sex in the updated TG 453 compared to the initial version (1981) is justified on the basis of further information being available from animals on t he carcinogenicity phase of the study and a more careful use of animals in laboratories than in 1981. The design of the carcinogenicity phase of the revised TG 453 is identical to the revised TG 451. The study will thus provide similar information on chron ic toxicity and carcinogenicity as TG 452 and TG 451. It will allow derivation of a point of departure (e.g. BMDL or NOAEL), and will offer greater efficiency in terms of time and cost compared to conducting two separate studies, without compromising the quality of the data in either the chronic phase or the carcinogenicity phase. The data from both phases (chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity) will reinforce each other, as the animals used in the studies are drawn from the same stock and have similar cha racteristics at the start of the study. Measurements carried out on the animals in one phase will be relevant for the animals in the other phase, e.g. clinical signs, body weights, haematology and biochemistry (if carried out), pathology. The terminal kil l of the chronic phase can act as an interim kill for the carcinogenicity phase. 1.6 Consideration of testing strategies 16. This section refers to testing strategies that may be applicable for certain regulatory authorities but have not been formally adopted by all. It does not recommend any particular testing strategy or approach, but suggests consideration of such approaches as part of an ongoing strategy to assess the toxic potential of a substance in an intelligent and iterative manner. As new vali dated approaches become scientifically appropriate for use in chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity assessment, and accepted by the relevant regulatory authorities, the study sponsor is encouraged to implement them where possible. 17. A reasoned scientific a pproach to the assessment of substances for chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity must first include an assessment of all available information that has the potential to influence the study design. This can include the identity, molecular structure, class, a nd physico -chemical properties of the test substance; any information regarding mode of action; results of relevant in vitro or in vivo toxicity tests such as genotoxicity, subchronic toxicity and toxicokinetics studies; anticipated use(s) and potential r human exposure; available (Q)SAR data; and relevant toxicological data on structurally -related substances. This analysis can focus the study parameters, but may also lead to the conclusion that a study can be refined in some way, or not conducted at all based on a weight of evidence (Carmichael et al., 2006; Doe et al., 2006; Barton et al., 2006; Cooper et al., 2006). 18. Integrating a wide range of information to determine the potential toxicity of a substance is becoming more common as the gap between asse ssments that need to be conducted and the resources with which to conduct such assessments widens. Efforts 8 are underway in many OECD countries to determine ways in which assessments of substances can be satisfactorily completed, and protection of public he alth and the environment achieved, while minimising costs in terms of time, money and animal use. However, the acceptability and use of testing strategies and weight -of-evidence approaches differ among OECD countries and regulatory sectors; thus, applicati on of these approaches should always occur in consultation with appropriate regulatory authorities. 19. Shorter -term in vitro or in vivo tests may provide information regarding potency, mode of action, metabolism, and/or target organ that can help refine the c hronic toxicity study protocol parameters or priorities for observation. Tiered approaches using a combination of in silico , in vitro , and in vivo tests have been proposed but are not yet widely implemented (Worth and Balls 2002; Becker et al., 2007). 20. A ph ased or tiered approach to the assessment of the carcinogenic potential of a substance should also be considered (Ashby, 1996). A number of shorter -term tests can be conducted which will provide useful information for determining whether and how a substanc e may be carcinogenic, including genetic toxicity assays, cell transformation or other cell -based assays, short -term cancer initiation -promotion tests which may or may not include toxicogenomic analyses (Ellinger -Ziegelbauer et al., 2005; 2008), and in vivo repeated dose 28 - or 90 -day toxicity tests (for a review on in vitro and in vivo short term test see Maurici et al., 2005). (Q)SAR prediction models have been used in a regulatory context to predict the carcinogenic potential of chemicals for several decades. There are also commercial (Q)SAR models available for predicting rodent carcinogenicity (Benigni et al., 2007). (Q)SAR models should be validated according to OECD principles (OECD 2007, GD No. 69). 21. A number of different strategies for assessing carc inogenicity have been proposed (Langley 2001; Worth and Balls 2002; Knight et al., 2006; Combes et al., 2008). All feature a stepwise process or decision tree that prescribes information analysis and stopping points where classification and labelling and/o r risk assessment could be possible. However, specific approaches have not yet been optimised or validated. 22. Consideration of particular tests or approaches should always be made within the context of whether the results will contribute mechanistic informat ion that will be useful in the weight -of-evidence assessment of carcinogenic potential (OECD, 2002b). 23. The US National Toxicology Program, along with institutes in other OECD countries, has had a longstanding interest in the use of transgenic or knockout mo use models for the assessment of carcinogenicity (Bucher and Portier, 2004), as they consider that these models offer potential refinements, in terms of study duration and animal numbers, over the traditional long -term bioassay. At the time this guidance w as prepared, some regulatory authorities in the pharmaceutical sector may accept studies with these models in combination with a full long -term rat bioassay in lieu of a second full bioassay in mice (ICH, 1997). In the past, the predictive ability of the m odels, and any refinements or animal reductions, have been questioned (Goodman, 2001; van Zeller and Combes, 1999; RIVM, 2004). A detailed review paper (DRP) on transgenic rodent mutation assays prepared by Canada was published by OECD (OECD, 2009). 9 1.7 Animal welfare considerations 24. The principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement), first articulated by Russell and Birch in 1959 (Russell and Birch, 1959), should be considered as integral to the assessment of carcinogenicity or chronic to xicity in mammals, in order to ensure sound science, maximize animal welfare, and minimize animal use. Animals in a condition of stress or distress have a documented effect on the outcome of the study (Olsson and Dahlborn, 2001; Reinhardt and Reinhardt, 20 02). For these reasons the following principles should be implemented as much as practicably possible. 25. First and foremost, as discussed above, consideration of documented existing information from any reliable source that could provide a refinement in the testing protocol or procedure is recommended. Existing information could be used to inform dose spacing or selection, exposure route, observation priorities, potential modes of action or target organs of the test substance, and/or study design. Use of thi s information to focus the study before it begins ensures that the study will meet the expectations of the study sponsor and/or regulatory authorities, decreasing the likelihood of repeat studies. 26. The use of the combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity st udy (TG 453) is also recommended, which can in most cases accomplish the objectives of both studies, and offers savings in the numbers of animals used. This is due to the use of 10 animals per sex per dose group for the chronic toxicity phase of the study instead of 20 animals per sex per dose group when the carcinogenicity and the chronic toxicity studies are performed separately. 27. Any studies involving animals should abide by the principles of humane euthanasia as detailed in the OECD Guidance Document 19 on the recognition, assessment, and use of clinical signs as humane endpoints for experimental animals used in safety evaluation, and in particular paragraph 62 thereof (OECD, 2000). This paragraph states that In studies involving repeated dosing, when a n animal shows clinical signs that are progressive, leading to further deterioration in condition, an informed decision as to whether or not to humanely kill the animal should be made. The decision should include consideration as to the value of the inform ation to be gained from the continued maintenance of that animal on study relative to its overall condition. If a decision is made to leave the animal on test, the frequency of observations should be increased, as needed. It may also be possible, without a dversely affecting the purpose of the test, to temporarily stop dosing if it will relieve the pain or distress, or reduce the test dose. Close and frequent observations are recommended in order to determine the status of the animals, and any animals exhib iting clear signs of severe pain or distress should be humanely killed. 28. Animals may be housed individually, or be caged in small groups of the same sex; individual housing should be considered only if scientifically justified. Further detailed information on housing, feeding, and handling will be provided in Section 3.5. 29. As will be further discussed in Section 3.2, while the route of administration will depend on the physical and chemical characteristics of the test substance and expected route of human exposure, mixing the test substance into the diet or water is normally recommended for rodent studies. Administration of the test substance by oral gavage in carcinogenicity and chronic toxicity testing is normally not recommended for the 10 reasons outlined in Section 3.2. If the oral gavage route is employed then its use should be justified. The testing of substances at potentially irritating or corrosive concentrations/doses should be avoided, as administering such substances could result in severe pain an d tissue damage at point -of-entry, which would compromise both animal welfare and the integrity of the study. 30. Testing the chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity of inhaled substances can be achieved using either of two exposure conditions: whole -body or nose -only/snout -only. Because of the long -term nature of chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity tests, the preferred exposure method is whole -body. However, nose -only exposure is generally preferred for studies of liquid or solid aerosol and for vapor that may c ondense to form aerosol. If rodent species other than rats are exposed nose -only, maximum exposure durations may be adjusted to minimize species -specific distress (GD 39). 31. Guidelines providing practical advice on animal welfare specifically for today's can cer researchers were updated in 2010 . They define and encourage sharing of best practice in laboratory work in the field of cancer research (Workman et al., 2010). R elevant information can be found in these guidelines , that applies to toxicological studies . 1.8 Quality assurance and good laboratory practice 32. In addition to the Test Guidelines themselves and this Guidance Document, there are many other sources of information on the generation of scientifically valid data, concerning good experimental design and reporting, and accepted codes of Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP (OECD, 1998; US EPA, 2007 ). The International Programme on Chemical Safety has produced detailed guidance on Quality Management for Chemical Safety Testing (WHO, 1992), while OECD also provides extensive guidance in its Series on Principles of Good Laboratory Practice and Compliance Monitoring (OECD, 1998) . It is essential that the standard or quality of the data reported is verified by a quality management (assurance) system involving independent monitoring of laboratory management and personnel, facilities and equipment, methods records and controls (WHO, 1992). 33. While implementation of a quality management system is primarily the responsibility of the testing laboratory and guidance on the principles of Quality Assurance or Good Laboratory Practice is beyond the scope of the current document, implementation of these standards are a prerequisite in demonstrating the competency of the laboratory and the reliability of the data generated. Quality assurance should be integrated within the entire process in order to ensure that the results are valid and that the final study report accurately reflects these results (WHO, 1992). 11 REFERENCES Ashby J, (1996), Alternatives to the 2 -species bioas say for the identification of potential human carcinogens Hum Exp Toxicol Vol. 15: 183 -202.

MODE OF TOXICOLOGIC ACTION Note: This mode of action guidance section is based largely from the U.S. EPA Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment, (USEPA, 2005) and the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) Workshop Report (IPCS, 2005) Table of Content: 1. Section 2.1 will define what is considered by a mode of action for a particular chemical and what data is needed to support a postulated mode of action; 2. Section 2.2 will describe the human relevance framework, which considers whether the observed rodent tumours are relevant for humans and 3. Section 2.3 will provide specific guidance on how to consider mode of toxicologic action data in optimizing the design of a long term study. It is important to note that while this chapter focuses primarily on the cancer endpoint, the mode of toxicologic action may be more generically applied to both cancer and noncancer endpoints 2.0 Background 33. Animal long -term bioassays have been used for more than a half century to determine whether pesticides , pharmaceuticals, industrial chemicals, and other types of substances might cause cancer or other adverse chronic health problems in humans. As such, cancer bioassays, recognized by national and international regulatory groups, have become the default fo r testing the carcinogenic potential of products when human use or exposure is anticipated. Inherent in these animal -based assessments is the assumption that the observation of tumours in animals is directly relevant to the risk of cancer in humans, and t hat the responses observed at high doses in animals could be meaningfully extrapolated to regulatory doses with relevance for humans (IPCS, 2005). In order to predict responses in people more accurately, information is preferred from animals that are as s imilar to people as possible. More specifically, the use of other mammals, such as dogs, rats, and mice, as models for responses in humans is based on the assumption that there are important similarities among mammals in the way they respond to chemicals. In fact, a qualitative similarity has been established in the response of laboratory animals and humans to carcinogenic substances. Most known human carcinogens have been shown to be positive for tumo urigenicity in well - conducted animal studies (Parekh and Dearfield, 2007). 34. Based on this assumption, such animal to human extrapolations, (dose and species) while necessary and practical, have been surrounded by intense discussion and debate. Through the evaluation of key events on the molecular and cellu lar level, a clearer understanding of how chemicals induce neoplasia has been realized. Such mechanistic 16 data have called into question the appropriateness of extrapolating certain rodent tumour responses to humans. Thus, cancer risk assessments are rare ly without controversy and are often heatedly debated within the scientific community (Holsapple et al., 2005) . 35. More recently, the understanding of the pathogenesis of neoplasia has evolved significantly. It is now recognized that cancers originating from at least some cell types may arise by a variety of independent pathways. It is also established that different carcinogens may have different modes of action and that some carcinogens act through more than one mode of action in different tissues. While some modes of action lead to cancers in both experimental rodents and humans, others that are carcinogenic in rodents are not in humans, at least under realistic circumstances of human exposure. To refine and improve the process of carcinogenic hazard ide ntification, and to avoid misidentification of nontumourigenic compounds as possible human carcinogens, it has become crucial that regulatory mode of action analysis be undertaken and that data to support such analysis be collected in a thorough and scient ifically rigorous manner (Rice, 2004). 36. Risk assessments have benefited from our understanding of the mode of action of carcinogenesis in both animals and in humans and from the use of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data to determine the appropriaten ess of assumptions and to characterize the biological basis underlying the use of such assumptions. There has been increased recognition of advancements in scientific thinking on cancer that is reflected in some regulatory agency's adoption of the mode of action paradigm (USEPA, 2005). In accordance with this line of thinking, some regulatory agencies have also provided a systematic framework to test hypothesized toxicity pathways. Because of the many benefits of using this mode of action framework, imple mentation has been widespread and is now commonly used by additional regulatory agencies and international organizations ( Meek et al., 2003; Boobis et al., 2006). . In the United Kingdom, the mode of action framework is being applied to the assessments of pesticides and industrial chemicals. The UK Committee on Carcinogenicity (COC) has noted its value with regard to both harmonization between agencies and internal consistency in its latest Guidelines (COC, 2004). It has also been adopted and is being implemented by Canadian agencies, for example in the evaluation of Existing Chemicals under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. The European Union has incorporated the framework into the technical guidance of assessments that are being updated for tox ic effects, including carcinogenicity, of new and existing industrial chemicals (ECHA, 2009). The framework has been featured by the WHO/FAO Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues in its evaluation of pyrethrin extract and its incorporation into the resulting monograph. Finally, IPCS in cooperation with international partners has taken steps to move the framework forward by melding it with the human relevance concept (IPCS Workshop, 2005). 2.1 \"Mode of Action\" Framework 37. The term mode of action is defined as a sequence of key events and processes, starting with interaction of an agent with a cell, proceeding through operational and anatomical changes, and resulting in e.g. cancer formation. A key event is an empirically observable precursor step that is itself a necessary element of the mode of 17 action or is a biologically based marker for such an element. Mode of action, contrasted with mechanism of action which implies a more detailed understanding and description of events, often at the molecular lev el than is meant by mode of action. The toxicokinetic processes that lead to formation or distribution of the active agent to the target tissue are considered in estimating dose but are not part of the mode of action as the term is used here. This chapte r focuses on the carcinogenic mode of action. There are many examples of possible modes of carcinogenic action, such as mutagenicity, mitogenesis, inhibition of cell death, cytotoxicity with reparative cell proliferation, and immune suppression. 38. Elucidat ion of a mode of action for a particular carcinogenic response in animals or humans is a data rich determination. Significant information should be developed to ensure that a scientifically justifiable mode of action underlies the process leading to cance r at a given target site. In the absence of sufficiently scientifically justifiable mode of action information, regulatory scientists generally take a public health protective default position regarding interpretation of toxicologic and epidemiologic data; animal tumour findings are judged to be relevant to humans and cancer risks are assumed to conform with low dose linearity. Mode of Action Framework: Animal Tumours 39. The framework is intended to be an analytic tool for systematically judging whether avail able data support a mode of carcinogenic action hypothesized for an agent in a transparent manner. It is not designed to give an absolute answer on sufficiency of the information as this will vary depending on the circumstance (IPCS, 2005). Amongst the strengths of the framework are its flexibility, general applicability to carcinogens acting by any mechanism and the ability to explore the impact of each key event on the carcinogenic response (IPCS, 2005). It is primarily based upon considerations for causality in epidemiologic investigations originally articulated by Hill (1965) but later modified by others and extended to experimental studies. The modified Hill criteria is useful in organizing thinking about aspects of causation, and they are consistent with scientific method of developing hypotheses and testing those hypotheses experimentally. A key question is whether the data to support a mode of action meet the standards generally applied in experimental biology regarding inference of causation. Components of a Mode of Action Analysis 40. To perform a mode of action analysis, the key biochemical, cellular, and molecular events need to be established, and the temporal and dose -dependent concordance of each of the key events in the mode of action can then be determined. The key events can be used to bridge species and dose for a given mode of action. The next step in the mode of action analysis is the assessment of biological plausibility for determining the relevance of the specified mode of action in an animal model for human cancer risk based on kinetic and dynamic parameters. (Holsapple et al., 2005) Postulated Mode of Action: Key Events 41. The postulated mode of action is a biologically plausible hypothesis/basis for the sequence of key events leading to an observed effect supported by robust experimental observations and mechanistic data (IPCS, 2005). Key events are measurable events that are critical to the induction of tumours as hypothesized in the postulated mode of 18 action. To support an associatio n, a body of experiments needs to define and measure an event consistently. 42. To evaluate whether a hypothesized or postulated mode of action is operative, an analysis starts with an outline of the scientific findings regarding the hypothesized key events le ading to cancer, and then weighing information to determine whether there is a causal relationship between these events and cancer formation. Again, it is not generally expected that the complete sequence will be known at the molecular level. Instead, em pirical observations made at different levels of biological organization (e.g., biochemical, cellular, physiological, tissue, organ, and system) are analyzed. 43. For each tumour site being evaluated, the mode of action analysis should begin with a description of the relevant data and key events that may be associated with a hypothesized mode of action and its sequence of key events. This can be followed by discussion of various aspects of the experimental support for hypothesized modes of action in animals an d humans. (See Appendix I. for examples of mode(s) of action.) Experimental Support for the Postulated Mode of Action 44. Experimental support addressing the strength, consistency and specificity of association, dose response concordance, temporal relationshi p and if the mode of action is biologically plausible all add to establishing a clear mode of action. 1. Strength, Consistency and Specificity of Association 45. A statistically significant association between key events and tumour response, observed in wel l conducted studies is generally supportive of causation. Consistent observations in a number of such studies with differing experimental designs increase that support, because different designs may reduce unknown biases. Studies showing absence/reduction of carcinogenicity when the rate limiting event is reversed, blocked or diminished, are particularly useful tests of association. Conversely, if enhancement of rate limiting key events increases the tumour response, this evidence would also provide stron g support for the postulated mode of action. Pertinent observations include tumour response and key events in the same cell type, sites of action biologically related to key event(s), and results from multistage studies and from stop/recovery studies (Boo bis et al., 2006). Specificity of the association without evidence of other modes of action also strengthens a causal conclusion. And while these factors provide additional confidence that the primary mode of action has been identified, conversely, a lac k of strength, consistency and specificity of an association tends to weaken the overall causal conclusions for a particular mode of action. 2. Dose Response Concordance 46. If a key event and tumour endpoints increase with dose such that the key events forec ast the appearance of tumours at a later time or higher dose, the shape of the dose/response curve could be revealed and a causal association can be strengthened. Dose -response associations of the key event with other precursor events can add further strength. 3. Temporal Concordance 19 47. If a key event is shown to be causally linked to tumourigenesis, it should precede tumour appearance. An event may also be observed contemporaneously or after tumour appearance; these observations may add to the strength of association but not to the temporal association. Pertinent observations include studies of varying durations observing the temporal sequence of events and development of tumours (see paragraph 66 on precursor/key events for application to long term studi es). 4. Biological Plausibility and Coherence 48. The biological plausibility of any postulated mode of action in humans depends on a consideration of dose -effect and dose -response relationships. (IPCS, 2005) The postulated mode of action and key events shoul d be based on contemporaneous understanding of the biology of cancer. If the body of information under scrutiny is consistent with other chemical agents for which the hypothesized mode of action is accepted, the case is strengthened. Note: Because some m odes of action can be anticipated to evoke effects other than cancer, the available toxicity database on noncancer effects can contribute to this evaluation. Alternative Mode(s) of Action 49. The possibility of other modes of action should also be considered and discussed. If there is evidence for more than one mode of action, each mode should receive a separate analysis. Furthermore, different modes of action can operate in different dose ranges; for example, an agent can act predominately at lower doses wh ere cytotoxicity may not occur. Ultimately, however, information on all modes of action should be integrated to better understand how and when each mode acts, and which modes may be of primary interest for exposure levels relevant to human exposure of int erest. Uncertainties, Inconsistencies and Data Gaps 50. Uncertainties should be stated clearly, fully and explicitly. They should include those related to the biology of the toxicological response and those for the database on the specific chemical being eval uated. Any inconsistencies, whether positive or negative, should be clearly noted and characterized with respect to the impact on the weight of evidence in support of the postulated mode action. Data gaps should also be identified and characterized. It s hould be clearly stated whether the identified data gaps are critical in supporting the postulated mode of action and what recommendations can be provided to address those data deficiencies in the future (Boobis et al. , 2008). Conclusion of Postulated Mode of Action Analysis 51. Conclusions about each postulated mode of action should address (1) whether the mode of action is supported in animals and (2) is relevant to humans and (3) which populations or life stages can be particularly susceptible. Special att ention should be paid to whether tumours can arise from childhood exposure, considering various aspects of development during these life stages. Because the cancer studies are usually performed with young adult or juvenile animals, conclusions about relev ance during early childhood generally rely on inference. Relevance of rodent mode of action for humans 52. Relevance of a potential mode of action is considered in the context of characterization of hazard and not at the level of risk. Anticipated levels of human 20 exposure are not used to determine whether the postulated mode of action is operative in a particular population or life stage, for example, in those with pre -existing disease. (USEPA, 2005) Human relevance is discussed in the following section (se ction 2.2), in the context of the Human Relevance Framework. 53. Other populations or life stages may not be analogous to the test animals, in which case the question of relevance would be decided by inference. Although agent specific data would be preferabl e, this review may also rely on general knowledge about the precursor events and characteristics of individuals susceptible to these key precursor events. Any information suggesting quantitative differences between populations or life stages should be flag ged for consideration in the dose -response assessment, and a separate risk estimate should be quantified for susceptible populations or life stage if data suggests a quantitative difference. 2.2 Human Relevance Framework 54. Considerable effort has been expe nded during the past several decades to evaluate the mode of action for specific chemicals causing cancer in rodents. However, the key question is the relevance of this postulated mode of action to human risk assessment. A framework was developed by an I LSI/RSI working group sponsored by the U.S. EPA and Health Canada to address this issue and to provide direction in determining the relevance of rodent tumours to human health (Cohen et al., 2003; Meek et al., 2003; Cohen et al., 2004). This human relevan ce framework is not prescriptive and does not provide a check list of criteria; it is an analytical tool that describes methods and a decision tree logic to establish a relationship between early cellular events and the development of cancer and its releva nce to humans. Knowledge of key events and the identification of a mode of action provide a more rational basis for human hazard and risk assessment. 55. The human relevance framework is based on three questions: (1) is the weight of evidence sufficient to establish the mode of action in animals?, (2) are key events in the animal mode of action plausible in humans? And (3) taking into account kinetic and dynamic factors, are key events in the animal mode of action plausible in humans? This is a more quantit ative analysis which addresses the relevance of tumourigenicity to a level of exposure, and again relies on a concordance analysis between animal model and humans. This approach focuses not only on dose response but also on quantitative differences betwee n species in fundamental biologic processes that can affect exposure. 56. Presentation in tabular form referred to as a concordance table can be particularly useful. The information in these tables should be relatively brief, as a narrative explanation. The re should be one column for the effect on humans for each key events evaluated and another column for the results in a different strain, species, or sex or for a different route of administration that does not result in toxicity. Factors may be identified that are not key events but can modulate key events and contribute to differences between species or individuals. Examples include genetic differences in pathways of metabolism, competing pathways of metabolism, and effects induced by concurrent patholog y. While information for evaluating key events in humans may come from in vitro and in vivo studies on the chemical, basic information on anatomy, physiology, endocrinology, genetic disorders, human epidemiology, and other 21 information that is known regard ing the key events should be considered in this framework (Boobis et al. , 2008) . 57. This human relevance framework is focused on hazard identification and evaluation. If the second and third questions are answered in the negative, then there is not a cancer hazard for humans and therefore no cancer risk. (Holsapple et al. , 2005). It is clearly acknowledged that departure from the default assumption of human relevance is a data rich determination. If a conclusion is strongly supported by empirical data, exp osure to chemicals producing the toxicity only via that mode of action would not pose a risk to humans. Therefore, no additional risk characterization for this endpoint of carcinogenicity is further warranted (Boobis et al., 2008). 58. Appendix II includes an example, where Pastoor et al. (2005) describe a rodent mode of action they judge not relevant for humans. This determination for thiamethoxam - related mouse liver tumours was based on the quantitation of key metabolites in vivo and in vitro that showed mi ce, but not rats or humans to be capable of generating sufficient amounts of these metabolites to initiate the hepatic toxicity necessary for tumour formation). Hazard Characterization 59. The hazard characterization provides the overall weight of evidence sum mary of the assessment. It summarizes the conclusions about the agent's potential effects, whether they can be expected to depend qualitatively on the circumstances of exposure, and if anyone can be expected to be especially susceptible. It discusses the extent to which these conclusions are supported by data or are the result of default options invoked because the data are inconclusive. It explains how complex cases with differing results in different studies were resolved. The hazard characterization highlights the major issues addressed in the hazard assessment and discusses alternative interpretations of the data and the degree to which they are supported scientifically. 60. When the conclusion is supported by mode of action information, the hazard chara cterization also provides a clear summary of the mode of action conclusions, including the completeness of the data, the strengths and limitations of the inferences made, the potential for other modes of action, and the implications of the mode of action f or selecting viable approaches to the dose response assessment. The hazard characterization also discusses the extent to which mode of action information is available to address the potential for disproportionate risks in specific populations or lifestages or the potential for enhanced risks on the basis of interactions with other agents or stressors. 2.3 Consideration of \"Mode of Action\" information to Optimize the Design of Long - term Studies An \"Integrative\" Approach 61. Before embarking on the design of a l ong-term chronic rodent study, the objective or goal of the study must be clearly defined. It is critical to explore potential challenges that might arise from having multiple objectives for the bioassay. For practical reasons, it is often the case that there are multiple objectives in this one study design. To this 22 end, multiple objectives can be accomplished by considering how the design of the study could be optimized for each individual objective. If the objective is to determine a chemical's carcin ogenic potential, and understand how it elicits its carcinogenicity (mode of toxicological action), a weight of evidence, integrative approach needs to be considered. 62. Using an integrative approach, the following information on the chemical would be weigh ed: What is the basic physicochemical properties of the chemical? Can the compound be administered orally for a long term duration? Is the material a direct acting DNA mutagen; is it genotoxic? Does the chemical induce liver enzymes, liver weight increase , hypertrophy? How does the chemical causes its toxicity in shorter term studies and is this consistent across multiple species? Does the chemical cause hyperplasia or toxicity in particular target organs? Does the chemical cause cell proliferation, infl ammation, cellular necrosis, apoptosis? Does the chemical cause hormonal perturbation in shorter term or subchronic animal studies? or Are there similar analogs, QSAR analyses or structural alerts for organ toxicity? Cancer? All these data become releva nt to the consideration of a chemicals primary mode of action and the determination of carcinogenic potential (Jacobs, 2005). Hypothesized Mode of Action 63. If the objective of the study is to provide data to test hypotheses regarding a mode of toxicologic a ction based on information from a structurally similar analog, SAR prediction, or if a chemical fits structurally in a particular class of compounds that is known to have a specific mode of action and similar target organ, the study design should include the consideration of dose spacing, temporal sequence of key events specific to the proposed or suggested mode of action, and subsequent precursor key events. Some key questions include: what properties of the dose -response curve are most important, the s teepness of the slope? How would one determine the placement of animals into the various dose categories and what are the necessary precursor events in the mode of action for carcinogenicity? The issues of a chemical's structural activity, dose selection and inclusion of precursor key events will be discussed in the ensuing paragraphs. Consideration of Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) 64. If information on potential modes of action on the chemical of interest or similarly structured compound analog (e.g., SAR) is available, this could assist in identifying the possible, proposed mode of action. In general, the results of shorter term, subchronic studies can also provide information needed to identify necessary precursor events, and inform the selection of adequate doses for a subsequent carcinogenicity study. However, the dose levels administered in a subchronic study in the parent or structurally similar compound that induce a particular targeted effect may need to be adjusted (increased or decreased) for incorporation in a carcinogenicity study. 23 Dose Selection/Placement 65. Dose selection and placement could be informed by how the toxicity of the chemical changes with increasing dose, and providing some possible insights as to the postulated mode of action. This approach would require some previously generated information (e.g., shorter term studies or toxicokinetic data). If prior evidence allows, it may be possible to optimize the study design in terms of the location of the doses and the allocation of ani mals to the doses. For example, if high dose only tumours are suspected from the subchronic or shorter term studies, the tumour incident in the cancer study needs to be evaluated at high enough doses and consequently, precursor events should be observed e arlier in time and lower in dose. Temporal concordance of key events will also be a critical element in this investigation; the number of dose groups may need to be considered so as to provide enough animals for multiple sacrifices/evaluation times. Depe nding on the state of the scientific knowledge regarding possible mode(s) of action, sensitivity may be less important constraint on dose group number than the need for an experimental design, that can compare the various alternative modes of interest. Th is is a method driven by hypotheses regarding the mode of action. Precursor/Key Events 66. With a hypothesized mode of action, the study design of the long -term bioassay can be optimized to include additional precursor key events (cytochrome induction, cellul ar proliferation, hormonal perturbation, necrosis/apoptosis, hyperplasia, foci development, clonal expansion, etc.) that would support a mode of action. Additional analyses of cellular proliferation at various time points (1, 7, 14, 28 days), or cellular necrosis/apoptosis and additional clinical chemistry parameters (e.g., GGT, ALT, etc.) could be included to provide a more robust mode of action analyses. Some of these key events may also be observed in subchronic studies and other shorter term studies. In including these additional parameters, it is important to consider dose selection and key events at doses and time points lower than the tumourigenic dose and observations earlier than the time of first tumours. In addition, for mode of action determi nations, there may be value in conducting more than the usual subchronic repeat dose general toxicity studies as a preliminary step to conducting a chronic/carcinogenicity study. (Appendix III includes a case study of the mode of action for conazoles, as a class of pesticides with a specific mode of action that illustrates this integrative approach for considering a chemical's postulated mode of toxicologic action.) 2.4 Overall Summary 67. The integrative approach to combining our understanding of a chemical' s toxicologic pathway by weighing data from short -term toxicity, subchronic toxicity, genotoxicity and other toxicokinetic data becomes critical when designing a long -term bioassay. If a mode of action is proposed, this information could greatly enhance t he design of the long-term bioassay to offer better insight on how a chemical elicits its toxicity and help elucidate the shape of the dose -response curve. To fully utilize information on the hypothesized mode of action, the design of the study would need to account for doses that need to be placed carefully so as to yield observations of subtle precursor effects or other biomarkers of toxicity without inducing confounding effects related to frank 24 toxicity. Potential for toxic effects observed in subchroni c studies to progress in severity to neoplasia needs to be considered. A dose that induces an overt effect in a subchronic study should not necessarily be excluded from a carcinogencity study if the effects can reasonably be anticipated to be precursor ev ents in the progressive development of neoplasia. This is defined as a key event or rate limiting step for the primary mode of action of the chemical. However, attention should be paid to the selection of a dose that induces such effects without excessive toxicity in the carcinogenicity study. Other data that are relevant for selection doses for a carcinogenicity study may be provided by toxicokinetic studies. Evidence that absorption and distribution are not saturated at a tested dose may support select ion of a higher dose for a carcinogenicity study.

Transcriptional profiles in liver from mice Examples of Animal Mode(s) of Action Framework 1. Example(s) of Liver Cytotoxic Mode of Action: Chloroform and Carbon Tetrachloride This paper summarizes recent developments in the continu ing evolution of Human Relevance Frameworks to systematically consider the weight of evidence of hypothesized modes of action in animals and their potential human relevance for both cancer and non -cancer effects. These frameworks have been developed in ini tiatives of the International Life Sciences Institute Risk Sciences Institute and the International Programme on Chemical Safety engaging large numbers of scientists internationally. They are analytical tools designed to organize information in hazard char acterization as a basis to clarify the extent of the weight of evidence for mode of action in animals and human relevance and subsequent implications for dose -response. They are also extremely helpful in identifying critical data gaps. These frameworks whi ch are illustrated by an increasing number of case studies, have been widely adopted into international and national guidance and assessments and continue to evolve, as experience increases in their application.

See website: http://www.epa.gov/sab/chloro00.htm Under the 2005 U.S. EPA Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (1), evaluations of carcinogens rely on mode of action data to better inform dose response assessments. A reassessment of carbon tetrachloride, a model hepatotoxicant and carcinogen, provides an opportunity to incorporate into the assessment biologically relevant mode of action data on its carcinogenesis. Mechanistic studies provide evidence that metabolism of carbon tetrachloride via CYP2E1 to highly reactive free radical metabolites plays a critical role in the postulated mode of action. The primary metabolites, trichloromethy l and trichloromethyl peroxy free radicals, are highly reactive and are capable of covalently binding locally to cellular macromolecules, with preference for fatty acids from membrane phospholipids. The free radicals initiate lipid peroxidation by attackin g polyunsaturated fatty acids in membranes, setting off a free radical chain reaction sequence. Lipid peroxidation is known to cause membrane disruption, resulting in the loss of membrane integrity and leakage of microsomal enzymes. By -products of lipid pe roxidation include reactive aldehydes that can form protein and DNA adducts and may contribute to hepatotoxicity and carcinogenicity, respectively. Natural antioxidants, including glutathione, are capable of quenching the lipid peroxidation reaction. When glutathione and other antioxidants are depleted, however, opportunities for lipid peroxidation are enhanced. Weakened cellular membranes allow sufficient leakage of calcium into the cytosol to disrupt intracellular calcium homeostasis. High calcium levels in 28 the cytosol activate calcium -dependent proteases and phospholipases that further increase the breakdown of the membranes. Similarly, the increase in intracellular calcium can activate endonucleases that can cause chromosomal damage and also contribute t o cell death. Sustained cell regeneration and proliferation following cell death may increase the likelihood of unrepaired spontaneous, lipid peroxidation - or endonuclease -derived mutations that can lead to cancer. Based on this body of scientific evidence , doses that do not cause sustained cytotoxicity and regenerative cell proliferation would subsequently be protective of liver tumors if this is the primary mode of action. To fulfill the mode of action framework, additional research may be necessary to de termine alternative mode(s) of action for liver tumors formed via carbon tetrachloride exposure.

J Environ Sci Health Environ Ca rcinog Ecotoxicol 25(3) and Increased Dimethylarsinic Acid The dose -response relationship for Dimethyl Arsenic (DMA) tumorigenesis based on mode of action consideration s will be nonlinear as it is dependent on genetic, biochemical and histopathological events for which dose -response relationships are nonlinear. There must be a sufficient concentration of DMAIII in the bladder to produce cell death and regenerative prolif eration. The dose -response assessment would ideally be based on use of DMAIII dosimetry at the target tissue because it represents the rate -limiting event of reductive metabolism to DMAIII to provide a level of exposure that will be protective against the key event of regenerative proliferation. Therefore, the mode of action analysis shows that sufficient DMAIII must be present to result in sufficient urothelial cytotoxicity and cell killing to result in increase cell poliferation and associated chromosomal aberrations. All of these events must occur to result in a neoplastic response. Any one event alone is not sufficient to lead to tumors.

EPA described this MOA and th e relevant cancer and reproductive toxicity data in the Atrazine: Hazard and Dose -Response Assessment and Characterization 29 (FIFRA SAP, 2000a). In brief, upon high levels of exposure to atrazine, the release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus is reduced, thereby lessening the afternoon pituitary luteinizing hormone surge in female Sprague Dawley rats. As a result, the estrus cycle lengthens. This, in turn, leads to increased estrogen levels and an increased incidence of mamma ry tumors in female Sprague Dawley rats.

Example of a Mutagenic Mode of Action: Chromium (VI) Based on the fi ndings from the National Toxicology Program (NTP) 2 -year drinking water studies in rodents that Cr (VI) significantly increased the incidence of carcinomas in the small intestine of male and female mice. A weight -of-the-evidence (WOE) approach was applied to judge the mutagenic data of Cr (VI) relative to the induction of gene mutations and/or chromosome aberrations. The next step was to determine whether the induction of gene mutations and chromosome aberrations, which was seen across in vitro studies, in animals (mice and rats) and in humans, was an early key event in the carcinogenic process. The synthesis and critical analysis of these data were instrumental in establishing whether the genetic damage occurs early and at doses that are within the tumo urigenic range. These two criteria are the hallmarks of the Cancer Guidelines MOA framework and were clearly supported by the Cr (VI) data. While this is largely a data -rich undertaking, most of the studies evaluated in this document were primarily designe d for hazard identification. Consequently, studies that specifically address various aspects of the MOA framework analysis are not always available for review. Despite this limitation, the WOE approach taken with Cr (VI) demonstrates the utility of this strategy in identifying missing data and establishes the influence missing data can have on the final conclusion. Based, on these considerations, it was concluded that there is plausible evidence that Cr (VI), administer via drinking water, acts via a mut agenic MOA for carcinogenicity (Akerman et al., ,A., and Rinde E. 2009 .

An evaluation of the mode of action framework for II. Example of Human Relevance Framework Evidence Evaluation of the Human Health Relevance of Thiamethoxam -Related Mouse Liver Tumors . (Pastoor et al., 2005) Thiamethoxam was shown to increase the incidence of mouse liver tumours in an 18 -month study; however, thiamethoxam was not hepatocarcinogenic in rats. Thiamethoxam is not genotoxic, and given the late life generation of mouse liver tumours, suggests a time related progression of key hepatic events that leads to the tumours.. These key events were identified in a seri es of studies of up to 50 weeks that showed the time dependent evolution of relatively mild liver dysfunction within 10 weeks of dosing, followed by frank signs of hepatotoxicity after 20 weeks leading to cellular attrition and regenerative hyperplasia. A metabolite CGA330050 was identified as generating the mild hepatic toxicity, and another metabolite, CGA265307, exacerbated the initial toxicity by inhibiting inducible nitric oxide synthase. This combination of metabolite generating hepatotoxicity and in crease in cell replication rates is postulated as the mode of action for thiamethoxam. The relevance of these mouse specific tumours to human health was assessed by using the framework and decision logic developed by ILSI/RSI. The postulated mode of actio n was tested against the Hill criteria and found to fulfil the comprehensive requirements of strength, consistency, specificity, temporality, dose response, and the collective criteria of being a plausible mode of action that fits with known and similar mo des of action. Whereas the postulated mode of action could theoretically operate in human liver, quantitation of key metabolites in vivo and in vitro showed that mice, but not rats or humans, generate sufficient amounts of these metabolites to initiate the hepatic toxicity and consequent tumours. Indeed rats fed 3000 ppm thiamethoxam for a lifetime did not develop hepatotoxicity or tumours. In conclusion, the coherence and extent of the database clearly demonstrates the mode of action for mouse liver tumo urigenesis and also allows for the conclusion that thiamethoxam does not pose a carcinogenic risk to humans because of toxicokinetic differences between mice and humans. 31 Appendix III. Specific Mode of Action Case Study: Conazoles Class of Pesticides Although a mode of action analysis is often time consuming and data rich, increased experience in evaluating mode of action data lead to the belief that certain aspects of this analysis can be minimized through the more efficient use of toxicology data. Ca rdinal to any mode of action analysis is the consideration of causality based on dose response and temporal concordance. Basically what this means is that the relevant key events leading to the adverse outcome must be demonstrated: 1) in the target organ; 2) at a dose where the adverse outcome is apparent and/or at lower dose(s); and 3) either before or concomitant with the adverse effect. A case in point is the pesticide specific conazole group of antifungal agents, many of which induce liver tumours in m ale mice through a mitogenic mode of action. In this section, this group of pesticides will be used to illustrate the strategy of how to make the most of the available data to inform a mode of action analysis. First, advantage is taken of the Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) to categorize the test substance and the available information on this class of compounds (e.g., many of these conazoles, including several that are used as pharmaceuticals for treatment of local and fungal infections, induce a wide range of toxicities that consist of induction or inhibition of hepatic CYP hepatotoxicity and liver tumours in mammals). Second, the mutagenicity data are evaluated to determine whether the test material is DNA reactive. Third, classic tox icological endpoints are examined. Among the 28 toxicological tests required for registration under The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (or \u00a7 136 et seq . This is a United States federal law that set up the basic U.S. system of pesticide regulation to protect applicators, consumers and the environment . Under FIFRA, the Test Guideline requirements for this set include: organ weight, clinical chemistry, and histopathological data; the studies typically 90 days in duration. T hese assays are quite flexible and readily lend themselves to mode of action analysis because they can be expanded to encompass a time course evaluation (e.g., 1, 3, 7, 14 days or 1, 2, or 3 month) and take into account specific end points of interest for a suspected mode of action by simply adding satellite groups of test animals. For the conazoles, key events leading to tumour induction are known: isoforms, increased liver weights, increased liver hypertrophy, induction of cell proliferation, and liver tumours. By expanding the sampling times and adding additional measurements such as liver enzymes (e.g., PROD, EROD, BROD and possible other liver function assays) and cell prol iferation tests, the mode of action analysis can proceed and generate meaningful results long before the data from chronic studies are generated. Similarly, the organ weight data and histopathologic data on hypertrophy and hyperplasia can be examined to d etermine if a time -related increase in liver weight occurs and if the development of hyperplasia is sustained. It is also important to note that data pertinent to the MOA analysis may also be found in other toxicology tests such as other subchronic, chroni c, carcinogenicity, developmental and/or reproductive toxicity studies. This is particularly true for target organ support, organ weights and histopathology and consistency across animal species. 32 Using this approach, it is not difficult to envision such an expanded and optimized assay as a predictive tool for liver tumours; thus, reducing the time, use of animals and man power necessary to insure that crucial elements in the mode of action framework are assessed adequately and accurately. 33 3. STUDY DE SIGN 3.1 DOSE SELECTION 3.1.1 Introduction 68. The purpose of a long -term bioassay (chronic toxicity and/or carcinogenicity studies) is the detection of biological evidence of any toxic and/or carcinogenic potential of the substance being investigated. Protoc ols should therefore maximise the sensitivity of the test without significantly altering the accuracy and interpretability of the biological data obtained. The dose regimen has an extremely important bearing on these two critical elements. Since one of the objectives is determination of the dose -response relationship in respect to any endpoints, the OECD TGs 451 (Carcinogenicity Studies), 452 (Chronic Toxicity Studies) and 453 ( Combined Chronic Toxicity/Carcinogenicity Studies) normally require at least thr ee dose levels, as well as controls. 69. OECD TGs 451, 452 and 453 outline general principles for dose selection in their respective bioassays. Provision of in depth guidance and a strategy for dose selection is however beyond the scope of the Test Guideline texts. This section of the Guidance Document is designed to underpin and expand the principles of dose selection for chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies outlined in the Test Guidelines . 70. These principles of dose selection are generally applicable t o a wide range of chemicals, whatever their field of application, e.g. pesticides, industrial chemicals and pharmaceuticals. However, although this document provides a number of references to specific requirements for dose selection for pharmaceuticals, th e principles applied in studies on pharmaceuticals may differ from that for other agents (Rhomberg et al., 2007; ICH, 2008). More information is generally available on the pharmacodynamic effects of pharmaceuticals, including the results of controlled clin ical studies, than for other types of chemicals. The intended systemic human exposure is known and detailed pharmacokinetic studies enable valid comparisons to be made between the systemic exposures in rodents at the chosen dose levels and those in humans under therapeutic administration of the drug, as measured by the comparative areas under the curve (AUC) of blood concentrations over time (Rhomberg et al., 2007). U sers of the Guidance should therefore consult the Guideline S1C (R2) on dose selection for carcinogenicity studies of pharmaceuticals for specific information on testing of such chemicals (ICH, 2008). 71. General principles and guidance on dose selection for chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rodents are provided in two publications of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). An initial 1997 report, entitled Principles for the Selection of Doses in Chronic Rodent Bioassays (ILSI, 1997) , presented common views on the selection of doses for carcinogenicity and chronic toxicity st udies while a second ILSI working group publication in 2007, entitled Issues in the Design and 34 Interpretation of Chronic Toxicity and Carcinogenicity Studies in Rodents: Approaches to Dose Selection (Rhomberg et al., 2007) provides additional discussion of the factors that influence dose selection in chronic bioassays ( Rhomberg et al., 2007) . The latter publication incorporates concepts included in other documents prepared by national and international organisations (OECD, ECETOC, NTP and USEPA), and places emphasis on the influence of the objectives of a long -term bioassay on dose selection, as summarised in section 3.1.3 of this guidance. Users of this Guidance Document are recommended to consult these publications for more information on the factors influ encing dose selection. The following sections provide guidance on (a) the principles for dose selection in the Test Guidelines 451, 452, 453, and (b) the influence of the objectives of a long term bioassay on dose selection. 72. The basic principles for the c onduct of chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies will differ, given that the endpoints are different. However, given the drive to reduce the number of animals for welfare reasons and the cost of carcinogenicity bioassays, there is a need to maximise the results to assess non -cancer effects that may arise during the study, as these may be critical to the interpretation of any carcinogenic effects. The possibilities for considering non cancer effects in the interpretation of carcinogenic effects are max imised in the TG 453, Combined Chronic Toxicity/Carcinogenicity Study. 73. While the guidance provided in this chapter can be taken as generally applicable to dose selection for either a chronic toxicity or a carcinogenicity bioassay, or a combined chronic an d carcinogenicity study, users of the guidance should be mindful of the primary objectives of the study in establishing the optimum study design in terms of dose selection. 74. In selecting appropriate dose levels for long-term bioassays (e.g. TG 451, TG 452, TG 453), a balance has to be achieved between hazard identification/characterisation on the one hand and characterisation of low -dose responses and their relevance on the other. This is particularly relevant in the situation where a combined chronic toxic ity and carcinogenicity study (TG 453) is to be carried out. 3.1.2 Principles for Dose Selection 75. The general principles for dose selection laid down in the TGs are summarised as follows: Dose levels should generally be based on the results of shorter -term repeated dose or range finding studies and should take into account any existing toxicological and toxicokinetic data available for the test substance or related materials (Barton at al. 2006). The highest dose level should be chosen to identify toxic effects including the principal target organs while avoiding severe toxicity, morbidity, or death (OECD 2000, GD No.19). It should be noted that the severity of toxicity and survival in a two year study may be underestimated from the short -term study; for this reason, Test Guidelines indicate that 35 a top dose lower than the dose providing evidence of toxicity in a short -term study may be chosen. When there is no toxicity in shorter -term studies it is recommended to consult with the relevant regulatory author ities. Dose level should be selected to reflect the purpose of the study. In most cases, dose levels and dose level spacing may be selected to establish a dose -response and to derive a point of departure (e.g., BMDL or NOAEL). 76. These principles for dose s election are broadly similar to the key principles for dose selection outlined in the ILSI publications (ILSI, 1997; Rhomberg et al., 2007), as listed in full in Appendix I. They are further discussed in the following sections. 3.1.2.1 Key information f or the selection of doses in chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies 77. Identifying/characterising carcinogenic effect is the primary objective of the OECD TG 451 on Carcinogenicity Studies while identifying/characterising other toxic effects is the pri mary objective of the OECD TG 452 on Chronic Toxicity Studies. The OECD TG 453 Combined Chronic Toxicity/Carcinogenicity Studies combines the objective of OECD TG 451 and OECD TG 452 . For all three studies the core minimum study design comprises at least o ne control group and three dose groups, each of which is exposed to different concentrations of the test substance. 78. The robustness of a carcinogenicity or chronic toxicity study, in particular the former, is dependent on a demonstration that the dose lev els selected in the study are adequate to show an effect or effects of the test substance, without producing either false negative results (because the doses selected were too low) or false positive results (because metabolic/ homeostatic mechanisms are ove rwhelmed, etc), which may be problematic in assessing risk in humans. 79. The data provided by shorter -term repeated dose or range finding studies, including 28 - day or 90 -day studies, are important in selecting the dose levels for a longer -term chronic toxici ty or carcinogenicity study. The dose levels used in such studies and the NOAELs established can be used as a starting point for dose selection, both in relation to the highest dose level to be chosen in the study and possibly (but not necessarily) to the lower dose levels. Considerations that should be taken into account in determining whether similar, lower or higher dose levels than those used in a short -term study should be selected for a chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity study include ( Rhomberg et al., 2007 ): whether the effect is an adaptive response (e.g., liver hypertrophy in the absence of any other evidence of hepatotoxicity); potential of the toxic effect(s) observed in repeat dose toxicity studies of shorter duration to progress to neoplasia. A dose that induces a marked effect in such study should not be excluded from a carcinogenicity study if the effect or effects can 36 reasonably be anticipated to be a precursor event in the development of neoplasia (e.g., a key event for the mode of action of the test substance). However, care should be taken that selection of a dose level that induces such effects will not result in excessive toxicity in the carcinogenicity study; the potential that an effect may limit the sensitivity of the chronic/carcinog enicity study to detect tumours (e.g. haemolytic anemia may limit the duration of the study due to an increase in mortality or to severe toxicity that may compromise the health of the animals); the duration of the short -term study (e.g., repeated dose 90 -day study, repeated dose 28-day study, two -generation reproduction study) and the potential for a toxic effect to progress in severity (e.g., progression from focal to multifocal necrosis); evidence of transitory effects that may be life -threatening: if pr echronic studies revealed transitory effects that may last during some days or weeks until metabolic capacity (e.g. by liver enzyme induction) is adapted, testing of high dose is limited by transitory effects of life -threatening nature (e.g., sedation); use of gavage for administration of the test substance in studies of shorter duration. A dose that induces overt toxicity in a gavage study may be tolerated if a dietary route of administration is selected for a carcinogenicity study because of the differen ces in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics resulting from the two methods of administration. 80. Additional evidence on the extent to which dose levels should be increased or decreased in a long -term study relative to a short -term study or studies may be provid ed by dose -response data from the latter studies. For example, a marked reduction in dose levels would be warranted if results from short -term studies show that a minor increase in dose is associated with a pronounced increase in severity or incidence of a lesion (i.e., a steep dose -response). It is recommended that all the information from such short -term studies, (rather than the use of an arbitrary factor e.g. one -tenth the highest dose tested in a short -term study that induced a severe toxic effect) sho uld be used when selecting the high dose (or mid and low dose levels) for a proposed carcinogenicity study. 81. Available toxicokinetic data (ADME) should always be taken into account when selecting dose levels for a chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity study, although such data may not be readily available for all chemicals, as they are not required under all regulatory schemes. Many toxicokinetic processes influencing absorption, distribution, elimination and metabolic activation or detoxication may become sa turated at higher doses, resulting in systemic exposures to parent compound or metabolites that would not be expected in the real life human exposures for which risk assessments are needed. The effect of repeated exposures on the pattern of absorption, met abolism, detoxification, and clearance of a compound will provide information on the internal dose achieved during chronic exposure under conditions of the bioassay. The importance of having data on toxicokinetics in reaching a decision on the design most suitable for a chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity study is stressed in this guidance and the use of such data will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 3, Section 3.4 of this Guidance Document. 82. Physiologically -based toxicokinetic (PBTK) modelling is al so a valuable tool for defining doses where non -linear toxicokinetics may occur, thus allowing this to be considered in selecting the highest and other dose levels in the study. The use of PBTK 37 modelling will be explored in more detail in Section 3.4 of Ch apter 3. Finally, specific mechanistic studies (where available) may provide useful information regarding target tissues affected by the test substance and the doses associated with effects on key events, and should be taken into account when selecting dos es for a chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity study. 83. Additional considerations in selecting dose levels for chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity studies arise as a result of practical constraints such as the physicochemical characteristics of the substance t o be tested (e.g., solubility, vapour pressure), palatability of the compound in food or drinking water, and other factors such as the potential for the test substance to cause adverse effects such as irritancy at the site of administration ( Rhomberg et al ., 2007 ). Further guidance on these aspects is provided in the ILSI publications (ILSI, 1997; Rhomberg et al., 2007 ) and will be published in Chapter 3, Section 3.5 of this guidance. 84. Information on, and consideration of, the mode of action ( MOA) of a susp ected carcinogen is particularly important, since the dose selection may differ depending on the known or suspected mode of action (Sonnich -Mullin et al., 2002; Cohen et al., 2003; Meek et al., 2003; Holsapple et al., 2006; Boobis et al., 2006; EPA 2005). In selecting dose levels for such a study, doses will need to be placed carefully, to yield observations of subtle precursor effects or other biomarkers of toxicity without inducing confounding effects related to frank toxicity. This approach requires some previously gathered information on potential modes of action, e.g. from genotoxicity studies. Further guidance on these aspects will be discussed in Chapter 2 of this Guidance Document. 3.1.2.2 Selection of the top dose 85. Dose selection should be based on the findings of subchronic or range -finding studies. The highest dose level to be used in a chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity study needs to be carefully considered and the reasons for the final choice clearly defined . Ideally, the dose levels selecte d will maximise the detection of dose -response relationships and facilitate the extrapolation of these to potential hazards for other species, including humans. 86. The selection of the highest dose level to be used in a chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity st udy has long been a matter of controversy. At the time when long - term animal bioassays began to be routinely used to assess the qualitative potential of a test substance to cause chronic toxicity and cancer, the emphasis was on testing at high levels in o rder to maximise the potential of such studies to detect effects. The concept of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), conventionally defined as the highest dose to produce toxic effects without causing death and to decrease body weight gain by no more than 10 % relative to controls (OECD 2002, GD No. 35) became well established. The MTD is often used in the assessment of a chronic toxicity or a carcinogenicity study to decide whether the top dose tested was adequate to give confidence in a negative result. Thi s Guidance Document focuses on the selection of the top dose, rather than attempting to define an MTD. 38 87. While some regulatory bodies or organisations interpret an adequate high dose to be a minimally toxic dose, others emphasize the need to select a dose le vel that is a maximally tolerated dose (i.e., more severe toxicity should be demonstrated). Thus, because of differences in views regarding the severity of toxic effects that are interpreted as providing evidence that an adequate high dose has been attaine d or exceeded, a completed carcinogenicity bioassay may be considered to be acceptable by one organisation but not by another. Many carcinogenicity studies can be challenged on the basis of selection of a top dose that is too high, particularly if there is a large interval to the next highest dose. This results in data that are difficult to interpret and cannot be used for regulatory purposes. Appendix 2 of Rhomberg ( Rhomberg et al ., 2007) provides detailed guidance on criteria that can be applied in order to assess the acceptability of the high dose level or MTD ( Rhomberg et al., 2007 ). 88. If the main objective of the study is to identify a cancer hazard, there is broad acceptance that the top dose should ideally provide some signs of toxicity such as slight depression of body weight gain (not more than 10%), without causing e.g., tissue necrosis or metabolic saturation and without substantially altering normal life span due to effects other than tumours. Excessive toxicity at the top dose level (or any other dose level) may compromise the usefulness of the study and/or quality of data generated. Criteria that have evolved for the selection of an adequate top dose level include: (in particular) toxicokinetics; saturation of absorption; results of previous repea ted dose toxicity studies; the MOA and the MTD. 89. Toxicokinetic non -linearity should also be considered in the selection of the top dose to be used. Although top dose selection based on identification of inflection points in toxicokinetic non -linearity may result in study designs that fail to identify traditional target organ or body weight effects, it must be appreciated that metabolic saturation in fact represents an equivalent indicator of biological stress. In this case, the stress is evidenced by appear ance of non -linear toxicokinetics rather than appearance of histological damage, adverse changes in clinical chemistry, haematology parameters or decrease in body weight gain (Toxicokinetics will be discussed in Section 3.4). 90. For compounds that are (or pot entially are) genotoxic, conventional considerations of top dose given above would apply. For compounds that are not genotoxic, the top dose should be informed by considerations of MOA (see Chapter 2). For a given compound, for which the mode of action is known or suspected, establishing a point of departure based on precursor key events, may also be protective against any carcinogenic effect. This is because non -genotoxic carcinogens produce cancer by perturbing normal physiology or biochemistry. The long -term assay should be designed to identify and characterise these key events and not necessarily cancer per se . 91. Nutritional effects, physiological factors, physical -chemical factors and compound bioavailability can influence selection of the top dose level to be used in a long -term bioassay. For nutritional and possibly other physiological reasons a maximum level is imposed, commonly 5% concentration in the diet (Sontag et al., 1976; Chhabra et al., 1990). 92. Palatability of a compound in either feed or water can also lead to perturbation of physiological homeostasis or nutritional status. A compound's solubility limit or vapour pressure may constrain selection of the top dose level. Irritation at the site of compound deposition may constrain dose or otherwise confound cross species 39 extrapolation. Inhalation of doses that overwhelm pulmonary clearance may lead to tissue responses that are specific to the species being tested; however, this does not apply to asbestos -like substances. These limitations may influe nce selection of the top dose. 93. The top dose used in the study may be based on a defined level of the target population's exposure of interest and multiples of that exposure (e.g. 100 times or 150 times higher based on dose ratios expressed in terms of body weight). If toxicokinetic data are available, dose levels based on internalised doses (e.g., AUC) can be used. It has been shown that the relative systemic exposure corresponds better with dose ratios expressed in terms of body surface area (AUC ratios) r ather than rations expressed in terms of body weight. It should be noted that the use of systemic exposure comparison between rodents and humans to derive the top dose may be useful in the case of pharmaceuticals testing (ICH, M3(R2) , S1C(R2)) but is not likely to be useful for testing plant protection products or commodity chemicals, given the uncertainties regarding exposure levels in scenarios where these are used, and given the need for these chemicals that the top dose be sufficiently high for the pur pose of classification for carcinogenic effect, i.e. an inherent potential of the substance in question to cause cancer irrespective the dose should be demonstrated, if appropriate. . 94. The relevance of the top dose level recommended to be used in the study to potential human exposures can also be debated. Mechanistic information gleaned from this type of study may be irrelevant. If the top dose level is set lower, to ensure relevance, the power to detect effects may be compromised . In short, positives may b e difficult to interpret vis -\u00e0-vis low exposure levels, because they may reflect a high -dose-only phenomenon. 3.1.2.3 Dose level spacing 95. Selection of dose intervals is influenced by the study objectives (see section 3.1.3) and the available informatio n. Dose levels and dose level spacing may be selected to establish a dose -response and to derive a point of departure (e.g., BMDL or NOAEL). The dose level spacing does not need to be regular. It may be reduced in regions of the dose-response curve where p articularly robust estimation is needed, e.g. in the range of the anticipated BMD or a suspected threshold. The increasing emphasis on consideration where the lower dose levels used in the study are placed, and the number of such dose levels, reflects the changing purposes of lifetime bioassays. 96. If the primary purpose is identification of hazard, whether this is chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity, the focus of dose selection should be on maximizing the power of the study and on the top doses tested. As th e risk assessment process becomes increasingly concerned with characterisation of human risk, there has been a corresponding need to characterise whether and how high - dose effects extend to responses at lower exposure levels as well, with a consequent int erest in how the lower dose levels are placed in bioassays ( Rhomberg et al., 2007). 40 97. Dose selection and dose level spacing need to be based, where possible, on the following considerations: known or suspected non -linearities or inflection points in the dos e-response; toxicokinetics, and dose ranges where metabolic induction, saturation, or non - linearity between external and internal doses does or does not occur; precursor lesions, markers of effect, or indicators of the operation of key underlying biologi cal processes; key (or suspected) aspects of mode of action, such as doses at which cytotoxicity begins to arise, hormone levels are perturbed, homeostatic mechanisms are overwhelmed, etc.; regions of the dose -response curve where particularly robust est imation is required, e.g., in the neighbourhood of the anticipated point of departure; consideration of anticipated human exposure level; a suspected threshold. 98. Dose levels should be selected to reflect the purposes of the study, and they should use available knowledge on how dose -dependent biological and impacted physiological factors may affect study outcomes. The Test Guidelines (TG 451, Par. 24, TG 452, Par. 24, and TG 453, Par. 26) indicate that The dose level spacing selected will depend on the cha racteristics of the test substance, and cannot be prescribed in this Guideline, but two to four fold intervals frequently provide good test performance when used for setting the descending dose levels and addition of a fourth test group is often preferable to using very large intervals (e.g., more than a factor of about 6 -10) between dosages. In general, the use of factors greater than 10 should be avoided, and must be justified if used. 99. If prior evidence allows, it may be possible to optimise the design i n terms of the location of the dose levels . A design often applied uses a mid dose that is half of the top dose, or the geometric mean of the low and high dose. This will ensure that the power and sensitivity of the assay is maximised and that at least one dose is unlikely to have a carcinogenic or other effect. This approach minimises the chance of a false negative (failing to detect an effect that actually exists) at some increased risk of a false positive (finding a high -dose effect that is an artefact of excessively high doses and is not relevant to the dose range of interest). 100. Limited information may be obtained regarding the shape of the dose -response curve, particularly if non -linearity is seen in the middle of the dose range. The power of the assay at lower dose levels will also be limited if the incidences of the responses of interest are low (e.g., rare tumours) and not markedly different from the controls. Information on the dose -response relationship would depend on how well the dose range of in terest is anticipated . 101. The issue of where to place the lowest dose should receive comparable attention as to the placement of the top dose. If the lowest dose is too low, it may be insufficiently powerful and therefore uninformative; if too high, it may l ose opportunities to characterise effects as near as possible to environmental exposure levels. For example, for pharmaceuticals, a dose sufficient to produce a pharmacodynamic effect or result in systemic exposure comparable with that expected at the inte nded clinical use is normally selected for the low dose level (see also ICH guideline S1C(R2)) . 41 102. It may be possible to place adjacent dose levels somewhat above and below the levels at which a key transition in underlying biological actions, including consi derations of the mode of action, is believed to lie, thereby revealing its influence on response. Transitions need not be sharp; typically, there are ranges of doses over which an underlying biological factor, such as metabolic saturation or cytotoxicity, comes increasingly into play. 103. When evaluating threshold effects in a chronic toxicity bioassay, the doses selected will include at least one dose high enough to show toxicity, at least one dose low enough to show lack of toxicity, and usually one but occas ionally more than one in between to help characterise the shape of the curve near the point where the threshold appears to lie (Rhomberg et al., 2007). These dose placement concerns differ from those in the carcinogenicity bioassay for substances where gen otoxicity is known or suspected; however, this difference disappears if the BMD approach is used. The same dose range is preferred for both phases of a combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenic study, particularly if the MOA is under investigation. 3.1.3 Integration of the objectives of a long -term bioassay 104. The ILSI publications (ILSI, 1997; Rhomberg et al., 2007 ) provide practical guidance on factors that influence dose selection in long -term bioassays, with particular emphasis on how the varying objective s of a chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity bioassay influence dose level selection. 105. Test Guideline 453 (combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity studies) identifies nine possible objectives : The identification of the carcinogenic properties of a chemical, resulting in an increased incidence of neoplasms, increased proportion of malignant neoplasms or a reduction in the time to appearance of neoplasms, compared with concurrent control groups; The identification of the time to appearance of neoplasms; The iden tification of the chronic toxicity of a chemical; The identification of target organ(s) of chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity; Characterisation of the dose:response relationship; Identification of a point of departure (e.g. , BMDL or NOAEL); Extrapolatio n of carcinogenic effects to low dose human exposure levels; Prediction of chronic toxicity effects at human exposure levels; Provision of data to test hypotheses regarding mode of action (EPA 2005; OECD 2009, GD No.116; Boobis et al., 2006; Cohen et al., 2003; Holsapple et al., 2006; Meek et al., 2003). 106. Various study designs have been proposed to address these objectives, as described by Rhomberg et al., 2007. The core study design for a long -term bioassay as laid out in TGs 451, 452, 453 primarily addre sses the objective of identification/characterisation of carcinogenic substances or those causing other toxic effects, while seeking to integrate the other objectives as far as possible. Modifications of the core study design in TGs 451, 452, 453 in order to optimise data for the other objectives may compromise the Mutual Acceptance of Data and should be discussed with the relevant regulatory authorities before the commencement of the study. More generally, it is recommended to ensure regulatory acceptance of the study design before performing any long -term bioassay to be submitted to a competent authority. 42 107. The different objectives outlined above seek to maximise the statistical power of the study at different points on the dose -response curve. The focus may be on a level of response or on the shape and slope of the overall curve. The situation is also complicated by the fact that, below a certain dose, attempts to increase statistical power by increasing animal numbers in particular dose groups become futile . 108. For the majority of bioassays, there will be one primary objective (typically the identification of carcinogenic potential and/or chronic toxicity) and several subsidiary objectives such as characterising the dose -response curve, extrapolating to low do ses, or identifying a point of departure. The nature of the subsidiary objectives will be contingent on the intended outcome. If a valid negative result is obtained in a carcinogenicity study (e.g. , OECD TG 451), and this was the only objective of the study, there may be no further questions to be answered. If a positive result is obtained, however, a number of issues arise regarding the nature of the carcinogenic responses and their relevance to the levels of exposure of target populations, requiring furt her investigation into the nature and interpretation of the effects seen. Consideration of the mode of action framework before embarking on a long -term bioassay will provide guidance on optimising the design to collect the information necessary to the interpretation (see Chapter 2). 109. The choice of dose levels for the identification of a point of departure will depend on the type of point of departure sought. For a NOAEL, a dose without effects is required but ideally at the highest dose at which this can b e observed. For a BMDL, the data from all dose levels is used but it is important that the responses differ at the different doses. 110. The study design selected at the outset should include dose levels that combine several objectives. One approach to achie ve this is to include additional dose groups in such a way that the optimal doses for a number of different objectives are all included (Rhomberg et al., 2007). Some doses would be optimised for some objectives and others for other objectives, essentially running several bioassays in tandem. 111. However, this is not feasible, given animal welfare, economic and time constraints. When attempting to combine these various objectives into a single study, selection of dose levels must be done in a way that does not compromise the primary objective while still allowing a secondary objective to be pursued in an acceptable albeit suboptimal manner. There may be embellishments to the core design based on study objectives but it would be a rare event when an erosion of th e core minimum would be acceptable. 112. Based on Rhomberg et al., 2007, four core selection schemes are presented below: 1. Hazard Identification/Characterisation Plus Dose -Response: The top dose is chosen to increase the study's statistical power to detect effe cts that may be rare. A second dose combines two functions: (1) hedging against the top dose being found to have been too high in retrospect, and (2) providing the opportunity for dose -response characterisation of any effects found. The lowest dose level o r, if considered necessary, other lower dose levels can be placed so as to inform dose -response, no -effect levels, or other purposes. Key challenges will be balancing statistical power and toxicological relevance of the top dose level and compromising amon g subsidiary objectives while 43 accounting for relevant dose -related physiological changes when setting lower dose levels. 2. NOAEL/BMDL -Seeking for Threshold Effects: The main aim is to identify no -effect (or low -effect) levels for the more sensitive adverse threshold effects. The top dose should aim at engendering an adverse effect, the lowest dose should aim at constituting a NOAEL/BMDL, and the intermediate dose or doses should be set so as to identify the dose levels at which the top dose responses begin t o manifest. 3. Assessment of Safety of Human Exposure Levels: This is modeled on safety assessment studies for nutrients and pharmaceuticals. For agents that are not genotoxic, show low toxicity, and evince no known difference in metabolic profile between rodents and humans, one can test multiples of anticipated human exposure. Lack of adverse effects at doses sufficiently above human exposure (and the perceived implausibility of non -threshold effects) gives evidence supporting the safety of the anticipated e xposures. The bioassay exposures should be selected on an appropriate basis for animal:human comparison; for instance, the application to pharmaceuticals is typically based on area under the blood concentration -time curve that results from anticipated hum an exposures. Special -Purpose Bioassays: this case would be beyond the OECD Test Guidelines and therefore is not developed in this document. 44 REFERENCES Barton HA, Pastoor TP, Baetcke T, et al (2006), The Acquisition and Application of Absorption, Dist ribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) Data in Agricultural Chemical Safety Crit 36: 9 -35.

Within a reasonable dose range, increasing the dose can increase the ability to detect an effect; therefore, doses for chronic rodent bioassays should be selected within this range to maximize the sensitivity of a chronic bioassay. However, trying to increase study sensitivi ty by increasing doses into ranges that do not reflect application of sound toxicologic principles could lead to results that are inappropriate for human risk assessment. Increasing the highest dose in a chronic bioassay may increase sensitivity within som e defined dose range, but the potential exists that different mechanisms of toxicity or chemical mode of action are active at higher doses, which may not be relevant to humans exposed to lower doses. In this case, selection of the highest dose may be influ enced by consideration of the mechanism/ mode of action and other factors discussed in Principle 4. However, when the highest dose in a carcinogenicity assay is limited by effects (e.g., a mode of action in one organ system) that are thought not to occur i n humans, one must be aware that it still is possible that a higher dose of the chemical may be carcinogenic in other animal/organ systems. To address these issues, the ILSI working group encourages an approach to dose selection that incorporates all relev ant information from prechronic studies and other sources, uses toxicologic tools associated with an understanding of the mechanisms or mode of action by which a chemical produces an effect (e.g., genotoxicity, cell proliferation, etc.), and uses good scie ntific principles to enhance the accuracy of judgments of potential human risks. In the case of negative studies (particularly where the highest dose is chosen based on a full characterization of the chemical's toxicity in prechronic studies), use of sound scientific principles as well as all available chemical, physical, and toxicologic data will lessen concern that the result may be a false negative. Similarly, in positive carcinogenicity studies, this approach will lessen concern that the result may be a false positive. In both cases, the predictiveness of the bioassay for human health effects will be improved. Principle 2 A chronic bioassay requires a major investment in resources and time, and the objective of such a study should be broader than hazard identification. Scientists who conduct chronic 2 The terminology used in the Guidance Doc ument regarding long term bioassay designing both chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies doesn't apply to this annex. 47 bioassays and those who use data from bioassays, including regulatory agencies, should encourage innovative approaches to dose selection by considering appropriate study designs, mechanistic data, and other in formation in the design and interpretation of studies. Use of additional endpoints and other information must be based on sound scientific rationale, and such designs should be evaluated on the basis of their individual merits. A goal of high -dose selectio n in carcinogenicity bioassays is, in the context of hazard identification, to reduce the likelihood of a false -negative result. However, it is recognized that the qualitative nature of the hazard (e.g., carcinogenic response) may itself be dose dependent. This principle encourages approaches to dose selection that incorporate consideration of mechanistic and other toxicologic information. Such approaches should improve the scientific basis for dose selection and aid in interpretation of data generated from chronic bioassays. Principle 3 Human exposure should be considered in dose selection, particularly for selection of the middle and lowest doses. Further, the middle and lowest doses should be selected to characterize the shape of the dose response curve a s much as possible. Selection of the middle and lower doses should take into account factors such as the mechanism or mode of action, toxicokinetics, and others listed in Principles 4 and 5 and should not be based solely on a fraction of the highest dose. Issues that should be considered when incorporating potential human exposure in dose selection include the human exposure route and mode, the dose range in the chronic bioassay in relation to human exposure, and the duration and frequency of human exposure , if known. Subpopulations that may be more highly exposed than the general population, or that are genetically more susceptible, also should be considered. The relationship between external and delivered (internal) dose (e.g., ingested dose versus dose de livered to the target organ, toxicokinetics) in both humans and test organisms may influence dose selection. Further, for substances expected to exhibit a toxicity threshold, or if the evaluation of carcinogenic potential is being combined with an evaluati on of chronic toxicity, the study should be designed to include one dose that does not elicit adverse effects; that is, one dose should be a NOAEL. Of course, caution must be exercised to ensure that the NOAEL is not simply an artifact of small sample size or poor study design. Principle 4 The [ILSI] working group has recommended the use of innovative approaches, additional endpoints, and other information in the selection of doses for chronic rodent bioassays. The following endpoints, generally determined in prechronic studies, should be considered in dose selection for chronic rodent bioassays. Further, it is recognized that endpoints other than those listed below may provide important information for dose selection, and use of those endpoints, where they are based on sound toxicologic principles, is encouraged. Such endpoints may be available presently, or they may be developed as the science of toxicology advances. 48 Histopathology The site, morphology, and severity of the treatment -related effects observed in the pre -chronic study should be taken into account in setting dose levels for the chronic study. Histopathological examination of tissues, especially the liver, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, respiratory tract, skin, spleen/bone marrow /blood, and endocrine tissues derived from properly designed pre -chronic studies, often provides information that is crucial for dose selection in chronic bioassays. Toxicokinetics Studies to determine the effect of dose (or exposure concentration) on abs orption, tissue distribution, metabolism, and clearance of a compound are helpful in selecting appropriate doses for the chronic bioassay. The kinetics of absorption will determine the internal exposure dose achieved. The absorption and clearance of the compound and its metabolites will determine the systemic and target organ exposure resulting from a single dose and can be used to design the treatment regimen required to achieve a desired internal dose. The effect of repeated exposures on the pattern of absorption, metabolism, biotransformation, and clearance of a compound will provide information on the internal dose achieved during chronic exposure under conditions of the bioassay. The nutritional status of the chronically exposed animals may be affected during the experimental period which is why adequate information on interactions between the exposure chemical and nutrionally important compounds may be of great value in the interpretation of the final results of the chronic study. Cell Proliferation In the process of chemical carcinogenesis, events related to induced cell proliferation might be critical in fixing mutations and in providing a selective growth advantage to pre -cancerous cells. Considerations may be different for direct mitogenic stimulat ion of organ growth versus regenerative cell proliferation, and these modes of action should be distinguished for the test agent. Further, apoptosis can be a strong determinant of normal and pre -cancerous cell turnover kinetics and should be considered. In formation on the dose dependence of regenerative cell proliferation is a useful adjunct to histological observations in determining the shapes of 49 organ -specific toxic response curves. This information, when available, can be of value in selecting high, mid dle, and low doses and in interpreting the results of the study. Physiological Functions Disturbances of physiology or homeostasis that would compromise the validity of the study should be considered in the dose -selection process. Examples include hypote nsion, inhibition of blood clotting, overwhelming normal pulmonary clearance mechanisms, immune system effects, and in some cases hormonal imbalance. Such disturbances, and their effects on the validity of a study, may be difficult to determine and may app ly differentially to different categories of chemicals (e.g., pharmaceuticals in which the desired pharmacological action is a physiological effect). Body Weight It is suggested that body -weight changes are the primary factor in the selection of the highe st-dose group (that is, when no other toxic effects are observed), a decrement in body -weight gain of no more than 5 -10% in pre -chronic studies should be used in the selection of the highest dose for chronic assays of carcinogenicity. Historically, scien tists have adopted a 10% decreased body -weight gain at the end of pre -chronic studies (typically 90 days duration) as the target that should not be exceeded in chronic (carcinogenicity) studies. It is now recognised that there is a positive correlation bet ween body weight and the occurrence of certain tumours in rodent species and strains used in safety assessment or for hazard identification; i.e., the higher the body weight between 6 and 18 months on test, the higher the probability that the animal will d evelop some tumours. Moreover, the lower the body weight, the less sensitive the animal may be to agent - induced toxicity, including cancer. A significant decrease in body - weight gain therefore could reduce the animal's ability to respond to compound -induce d toxicities. Clinical Chemistry, Haematology, Urinalysis 50 Clinical chemistry and urinalysis results are best used to support dose-selection decisions based on other criteria/parameters. Changes in serum clinical chemistry in the absence of histopathologi cal observations may not affect high -dose selection but may complement dose -selection decisions based on toxicokinetics, cell proliferation, and other parameters. Haematology results also are more often affected secondarily to other processes more relevant for dose selection (e.g., inflammation). However, when haematological tissues are determined to be a target organ in pre -chronic studies, haematology results may be an appropriate basis for dose selection. Organ Weights Organ weights are not often the cr itical factor in selection of doses for chronic rodent bioassays. Chemically induced changes in organ weights, however, should be considered in conjunction with other data in the dose -selection process. Ideally, data from the factors and endpoints listed above would be collected from pre -chronic studies and used to select doses for chronic studies; however, not all parameters may be useful or necessary for every compound. Even when based on information concerning the points described above, dose selection for a chronic bioassay will remain an inexact process; thus, reconsideration of these same points must be made when interpreting and assessing the significance of the effects obtained in the bioassay. Principle 5 Physicochemical factors (e.g., solubility, vapour pressure), the bioavailability of the compound, the palatability of the compound in food or drinking water, and other factors such as the potential for the substance to cause adverse effects at the site of administration (e.g., irritation, erosion, and ulceration) will influence the selection of the highest dose for chronic rodent bioassays. It is recommended that doses for chronic rodent bioassays be selected to minimise or avoid adverse nutritional, physical, organoleptic, and irritant effects. 51 3.2 ROUTES OF EXPOSURE AND DOSE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERATIONS 113. The choice of the route of administration depends on the physical and chemical characteristics of the test substance, its intended field of application, the availability of information on short er-term repeat dose studies and the predominant route of human exposure Comparison across the set of studies available for a given chemical will be more robust if the parameters of the study e.g., route, dose volume, vehicle, remain constant between all th e repeat dose toxicity studies. The three main routes of administration used in chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies are oral, dermal and inhalation. For example, if human exposure to the test substance is likely to be through food or is a pharmac eutical intended to be taken by mouth, the relevant route of administration will be the oral route, while for a workplace gas, inhalable dust or volatile liquid, inhalation should be the route of choice. The dermal route may be chosen, e.g. for substances used in the workplace, where skin contact is likely, or for pharmaceuticals applied to the skin. Other routes such as subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection have been used when they are considered to be more appropriate for the anticipated route of expo sure of humans (see paragraphs 134 and 135). In choice of route of administration of the test chemical due consideration should be given to animal welfare including choice of routes different from the predominant route of human exposure, if relevant. 114. Give n the potential for oral exposure to a wide range of chemicals and also the practical experimental considerations associated with the long duration of chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies, the oral route is the route most commonly used in chronic t oxicity and carcinogenicity studies. Route -to-route extrapolation may be considered for systemic effects when reliable data on ADME are available, rather than carrying out an additional study by a second route. For example, it may be possible to carry out an assessment of systemic effects via inhalation exposure based on the results of an oral chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity study (Gerrity and Henry, 1990). The use of route -to-route extrapolation should be decided on a case -by-case basis (Nielsen et al., 2008) and is not however relevant for the assessment of local toxicity. 3.2.1 The oral route of exposure 115. Test substances may be administered via the diet or drinking water, by oral administration in capsules or by gavage, normally in a vehicle, depend ing on the physical and chemical characteristics of the test substance, its intended field of application and the predominant oral route of exposure of humans . Each method has advantages and disadvantages, and it should in particular be kept in mind that t he toxicokinetics of the test substance may be affected by the method of oral administration . Data from previous short -term toxicological studies, including data on toxicokinetics, can provide information on potential local gastrointestinal effects and the extent of bioavailability of the test substance, in order to select the most appropriate route of oral administration and to demonstrate that systemic exposure is adequate (see also chapter 3.4). 52 116. The animals are dosed with the test substance daily (seve n days per week), normally for the entire duration of the study. Any other dosing regime, e.g., five days per week, needs to be justified. In the case of rodents, d osing of the animals should begin as soon as possible after weaning and acclimatisation and preferably before the animals are 8 weeks old. 3.2.1.1 Administration via the diet 117. Oral administration via the diet is the preferred route of administration if human exposure to the test substance is also likely to be via the diet. This route of admini stration may be appropriate if the objective is to establish an ADI or TDI, for example for substances deliberately added to food, substances released from food contact materials or for environmental contaminants entering the food chain, and the pattern of exposure is continuous ingestion of small doses. However oral gavage studies may also be used to derive an ADI or a TDI. 118. When using oral administration via the diet, t he test substance is administered in the diet either as a constant dietary concentration (mg/kg diet), or as a constant dose level in terms of the animal's body weight. In the latter case the dietary concentration must be adjusted regularly based on anticipated food consumption and body weight of the animals. While doses are expressed in term s of mg/kg diet, food consumption must be monitored on a cage basis at least weekly in order to be able to derive the intake of the test substance on mg /kg body weight per day or mg/m2 per day . The food intake e.g. in the rat decreases from above 100 g pe r kg bw per day in early life (6 -8 weeks, at the commencement of the study) to about little above 50 g per kg bw per day for older females (e.g. 6 months or more) and below 50 g per kg bw per day for older males. This will lead to a gradual decrease in int ake of dietary administered test substance over age when keeping the dietary concentration of the test chemical constant. The concentration of the chemical in the feed should not normally exceed an upper limit of 5% of the total diet (FDA, 1982, Borzelleca , 1992), although higher levels are feasible (e.g. when testing carbohydrates or proteins) as long as the diet is adapted nutritionally adequately, e.g. the test substance is incorporated, at the expense of other components in a purified diet (Howlett et a l, 2003). 119. Oral administration via the diet has the advantage that no handling of the animals is required. However, the palatability of the diet may be reduced at high dietary levels due to the taste or odour of the test substance, resulting in reduced fo od intake and thus reduced exposure to the test substance. This is likely to have been identified in previous shorter -tem studies and may require the introduction into the study design of an additional control group, pair fed (i.e. having matched food inta ke) in parallel with the high dietary level test group (see section 3.5.2 for further details). The substance should be stable during the preparation, storage and period of administration of the diet, for example it should not react chemically with dietary constituents, and analytical data must be provided to demonstrate this. It is also essential to ensure that the substance is mixed homogeneously in test diet at the desired level and, again, analytical data must be provided to demonstrate this, as requir ed under Good Laboratory Practice (OECD, 1998). 53 3.2.1.2 Administration via drinking water 120. Oral administration in drinking water is the method of choice if human exposure to the test substance is likely to be via drinking water (e.g. drinking water conta minants) or in liquids (e.g. for substances that are volatile, or reactive with feed components, or any case where drinking water has an advantage over diet administration such as for soft drinks or beverages). The test substance is normally incorporated a t a fixed concentration in the drinking water, at the approximate levels (in mg/ml water) required to provide the dose levels selected for the study (in mg/kg body weight per day), based on anticipated water consumption of the animals. While doses are expr essed in terms of mg/ml water, water consumption must be monitored on a cage basis at least weekly in order to be able to derive the intake of the test substance on mg/kg body weight per day . Concerning possible adjustment of the concentration of the test substance in the drinking water e.g. when this route of administration causes changes in water consumption due to palatibility of the drinking water, similar measures as described for dietary dosing are appropriate (see paragraph 119) (Sharp and Regina, 19 98; Wolfensohn and Lloyd, 1998; Pool, 1999; Nielsen et al, 2008). The test substance should not markedly affect the palatability of the drinking water or cause marked changes in the pH, and its content and stability must be demonstrated analytically, as re quired under GLP (OECD, 1998). 3.2.1.3 Administration via gavage or encapsulation 121. Oral intubation (gavage) may be used if administration in the diet or drinking water is not possible, e.g. because of stability or palatability considerations. However, in the interests of animal welfare in particular, administration of the test substance by oral gavage should preferentially be restricted to those agents for which a bolus dose administration reasonably represents potential human exposure (e.g., administrat ion of pharmaceuticals or food supplements orally at one or more doses per day) ( Craig and Elliott, 1999; Brown et al.2000). Gavage dosing is experimentally more difficult than dietary administration, inducing stress in the animals which has toxicological implications ( Brown et al.2000) , and also requires daily handling of the animals, which may interfere with experimental parameters e.g. if neurobehavioural assessments are carried out during the study. Some laboratories may include a second control group t o address this potential confounding factor. 122. If the test substance is administered by gavage, this should be done using a stomach tube or a suitable intubation cannula, at similar times each day. The test substance may be administered in capsules, disso lved or suspended in a suitable vehicle. Administration b y encapsulation rather than gavage dosing is a common route for dogs, but is not a preferred route for rodents, due to the associated technical difficulties. Vehicles of choice include oil (e.g., cor n oil) or aqueous sol utions of thickeners such as carboxymethylcellulose, although other vehicles may be used. The maximum volume of solution that can be given by gavage in one dose depends on the size of the test anim al. For rodents, the volume ordinarily should not exceed 1 ml/100 g body weight, except in the case of aqueous solution s where 2 ml/100g body weight may be used (Diehl et al. 2001) . If the gavage vehicle is oil, the use of a low -fat diet should be considered, and the volume administered should normally not exceed 0.5 ml/100 g body weight/day, since the administered oil may interfere with feed intake . 54 123. Normally a single dose will be administered once daily, but where for example a substance is a local irritant or the pattern of human dosing is mu ltiple doses per day, the daily dose may be administered as a split dose e.g. twice a day , within a 6 hour period. Variability in dose volume should be minimised by adjusting the concentration to ensure a constant volume at all dose levels. Potentially co rrosive or irritant substances may however need to be diluted to avoid severe local effects, and testing at concentrations that are likely to be corrosive or irritant to the gastrointestinal tract should be avoided T he frequency and length of time for whic h the animals in a chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity study are dosed can lead to irritation in the oesophageal tissue and distress of the animals, potentially compromising the integrity of the study. If oral gavage is used, careful observation should be conducted after dosing to watch for signs of distress such as laboured breathing, sudden lethargy, or poor mucous membrane colour. 3.2.2 The dermal route of exposure 124. The dermal route of exposure has been used in long -term carcinogenicity studies, primar ily in the assessment of carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in skin painting studies generally carried out in the mouse. Although the dermal route may be used in assessing the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of substances such as workplace chemicals, where skin contact is likely, or for pharmaceuticals applied to the skin , for which continuous dermal contact is anticipated, it is in practice a difficult route for long -term administration of a test substance, and the animal welfare im plications involved in carrying out a 1 - or 2-year dermal exposure study are significant . 125. Assessment of systemic toxicity or carcinogenicity using the dermal route is only appropriate if it has been demonstrated that the test substance is bioavailable via the skin, i.e. it crosses the skin barrier. This may be assessed initially via a dermal penetration study to determine extent of absorption through the skin i n vivo or in vitro in accordance with OECD TG 427 or OECD TG 428 (OECD 2004a, 2004b) and followi ng the guidance laid down in GD 28, the OECD Guidance Document for the conduct of skin absorption studies (OECD 2004c). This should be followed by a short term 21/28 day dermal toxicity study (TG 410, OECD, 1981) before conducting the longer term study. If the chemical does not penetrate the dermal layer, it is not appropriate to use this route for examination of chronic toxicity. 126. The method is based on the repeated application of the test substance, generally at a defined concentration in mg/ml in a su itable vehicle, to a clipped or shaved area of skin of approximately 10% of the total body surface area, to provide the desired dose in mg/kg body weight per day. Application is fo r at least 6 hours per day, 7 days per week, for a period of 24 months. Animals are normally housed separately in dermal studies to prevent grooming behaviors and oral ingestion of the test substance. TG 410 on Repeat Dose Dermal Toxicity: 21/28 day study and Subchronic Dermal Toxicity: 90 day study (OECD, 1981) should be consulte d in the case of testing carried out by the dermal route, 127. The site may be occluded with polyethylene sheeting and gauze patches or semi -occluded, in order to prevent dislodgement of material and oral ingestion, which 55 could affect the validity or usefulne ss of the study. With volatile or semi -volatile materials, application and covering procedures should minimise the possibility of evaporation. However, long -term dermal mouse studies without occlusion are acceptable when justified scientifically, consideri ng the technical difficulties of occlusion when using this species. 3.2.3 The inhalation route of exposure 128. If it is likely that humans may be exposed by inhalation to a test substance, either as a gas, a vapour, or a liquid or solid aerosol (or a mixtur e thereof), the inhalation route should be used to evaluate the chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity of the substance in animals. The results of acute, subacute (28 days), subchronic (/90 days) and range finding inhalation studies should be considered whe n designing these studies and selecting concentration levels that will yield robust data regarding local and systemic toxicity. When testing substances which are irritants and/or corrosive, existing information should be used in selecting an appropriate di lution ratio for testing (see paragraph 130). This guidance does not extend to the testing of nanoparticles which can pose challenging physiological and methodological problems 129. A chronic inhalation toxicity or carcinogenicity study should follow the princi ples described in Test Guideline 413 (subchronic inhalation toxicity: 90 day study, OECD, 2009a) in all respects except for the number of animals per group and study duration. Exposure by the inhalation route is normally carried out for 6 hours per day, 7 days per week, but exposure for 5 days per week may also be used, if justified. A rationale must be provided when using an exposure duration less than 6 hours per day. If rodent species smaller than rats, e.g. mice, are exposed nose -only, maximum exposure durations may be adjusted to minimise species -specific distress. The exposure restraining tubes must be adapted to the size of this species. Historical data must be available to demonstrate that the exposure technology chosen does not impose undue stress to the animals exposed. Endpoints suggestive of undue immobilization stress - related effects include marked changes body temperature, changes in ventilation, or decrease in body weight gains. The duration of a chronic toxicity study by the inhalation route will normally be 12 months and that for a carcinogenicity study will be 18-24 months, dependent on the species used (see also Section 3.3.3 of this guidance). Further general guidance on the performance of an inhalation toxicity study can be found in the G uidance Document 39 on Acute Inhalation Toxicity Testing (GD 39; OECD, 2009b) and the OECD Guidance Document on Histopathology for Inhalation Toxicity Studies. Although GD 39 is intended to provide guidance for acute inhalation studies, the technical aspec ts of exposing animals and generating and characterizing test atmospheres are similar for repeated exposures and single exposures and are therefore also applicable for chronic and carcinogenicity inhalation studies. 130. The nature of the test substance and th e object of the test should be considered when selecting an inhalation chamber. The preferred mode of exposure is nose -only, which is well tolerated by rodents in long -term studies. To avoid oral exposure due to grooming of particles deposited on the fur, nose-only exposure is generally preferred for studies of liquid or solid aerosols and for vapours that may condense to form aerosols. Special objectives of the study may be better achieved by using a whole -body mode of exposure, but this should be justif ied in the study report. Particular attention 56 should be paid to the technical problems that may arise from the large numbers of animals in whole body inhalation chambers (e.g., time required to attain inhalation chamber steady -state, heat and CO 2 productio n, and adsorption of test article on inhalation chamber walls and other surfaces). To ensure atmosphere stability when using a whole -body chamber, the total volume of the test animals should not exceed 5% of the chamber volume, and there should be a sustai ned dynamic airflow of at least 10 air changes per hour. Principles of the nose -only and whole body exposure techniques and their particular advantages and disadvantages are addressed in GD 39. 131. Test substances that are irritating or corrosive should alway s be tested using methodology laid out in Test Guideline TG 413 because it provides the study director or principal investigator with control over the selection of target concentrations. Corrosive or irritating test substances should be tested at concentra tions that will yield the desired degree of toxicity without affecting longevity or undue stress to respiratory tract irritation (GD 39; OECD, 2009b). Any information available on the corrosive or irritancy potential of the substance, including inhalation toxicity studies, existing in vitro data, pH values, and data from similar substances, should be considered in the design of a long -term study. When exposing animals to corrosive or irritating substances, the targeted concentrations should be low enough to not cause marked pain and distress, yet sufficient to extend the concentration -response curve to levels that reach the regulatory and scientific objective of the test. These concentrations should be selected on a case -by-case basis, preferably based upon adequately designed range - finding studies that provide information regarding the critical location of irritation within the respiratory tract and endpoint for probing it. Adequately designed range - finding studies should demonstrate whether respiratory trac t irritation depends on any irritation threshold (concentration -dependent) or on the total daily exposure intensity (concentration x time - dependent), and whether carry -over effects from one exposure day to another may lead to time -dependent exacerbations . Some irritant effects are instant in onset and others require time to accumulate. These factors need to be identified and may serve as justification for concentration selection. 132. Species selection should be carefully considered for test substances causin g upper respiratory tract irritation because numerous secondary species -specific physiological responses make the extrapolation from small rodents to humans more difficult (GD 39, OECD, 2009b). In depth justification for species -selection is necessary when using species other than rats for inhalation studies of irritant test substances. 133. For substances likely to accumulate in the lung over time due to poor solubility or other properties, the degree of lung -overload and delay in clearance needs to be estimate d based on adequately designed pre -studies; ideally a 90 -day study with postexposure periods long enough to encompass at least one elimination half -time. The use of concentrations exceeding an elimination half -time of approximately 1 year due to lung -overl oad at the end of study is discouraged. 3.2.4 Other routes of exposure 134. Other routes of exposure e.g. subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection are generally only used in chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity studies when they mirror the 57 anticipated route o f administration in humans, such as in the case of pharmaceuticals, although they have been used in experimental carcinogenicity studies, e.g. on insoluble materials such as fibres and plastics. For example subcutaneous or intramuscular injections may be u sed for pharmaceuticals and for materials designed to be used as implants or prostheses, while intravenous administration could be appropriate for substances that are administered by this route due to pharmacokinetic considerations such as lack of bioavail ability by other routes. Intravenous administration may be via bolus injection, slow intravenous injection or intravenous infusion. The subcutaneous and intraperitoneal routes have been used in carcinogenicity bioassays for some solid - state, insoluble mate rials. 135. For substances administered parenterally, the dose volume used, stability of the formulation before and after administration, pH, viscosity, osmolality, buffering capacity, sterility and biocompatibility of the formulation are factors to consider ( Diehl et al. 2001). The smallest needle size should be used for administration, taking into account the dose volume, viscosity of injection material, speed of injection and species. (Diehl et al. 2001). The use of parenteral injections in chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies is likely to result in local inflammation, and has significant animal welfare implications. REFERENCES Borzelleca J.

The choice of species to be used in a chronic toxicity or a carcinogenicity study is dictated by a number of factors, including the following: physiological and metabolic similarity to humans, in order to provide a valid model for extrapolation of the findings, familiarity with the species, availability of existing data on the species chosen, lifespan of the animals, ease of handling under experimental conditions, other issues such as cost of maintenan ce, litter size, and gestation period. Rodents (e.g. rats, mice or hamsters) have been used extensively, also dogs and primates. The choice of species must be justified and may be dictated by the purpose of the study (e.g. chronic toxicity or carcinogenic ity) and by regulatory requirements. It should also be noted that mechanistic studies should be performed on the same species and strain as the cancer/chronic toxicity studies unless otherwise scientifically justified. 137. With few exceptions, carcinogenicity and combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity studies are normally carried out in rodent species. Similarly, chronic toxicity studies are normally carried out in rodents. Chronic toxicity testing in non -rodents may however be required under certain regula tory regimes. The dog has been a commonly used non - rodent species in chronic toxicity studies, although several regulatory regimes have now discontinued this requirement considering a chronic toxicity study in dogs provides no added value compared with a 9 0 day subchronic dog study. There has been extensive debate about the need for, and added -value of, a chronic toxicity study in the dog as discussed further in section 3.3.2 (Box and Spielman, 2005; Doe et al. 2006; EFSA, 2007; Kobel et al, 20 10). 3.3.1 Testing in rodents 138. As indicated, rodent species have been used in the majority of chronic toxicity studies and in almost all carcinogenicity testing. The standard approach to carcinogenicity testing has been to use two species, the rat and t he mouse, although in recent years a number of alternative approaches have been initiated to refine this approach in hazard identification and for risk assessment purposes, as discussed further in paragraphs 147 onwards. Advantages deriving from the use o f rats and mice include the (relatively) low cost of maintenance, their short lifespan, meaning that a lifetime study can be completed in 2 - 3 years, and the availability of a large amount of historical data on age-related biochemical, haematological and pathological changes including on spontaneous tumours at specific organ sites. 61 139. Rodents have a number of metabolic pathways, physiological and pathological responses in common with humans. However, there are a number of instances where the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity findings in rodents have been demonstrated not to be relevant to humans, because of toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic differences including species -specific pathways of metabolism, genetic differences, enzyme differences, differences in toxicologic pathways etc. If differences in toxicokinetics or toxicodynamics and/or other relevant parameters are suspected between the test species and humans, that may have an impact on the relevance of the outcome of the study, these should be explored to determine if another test species may be more appropriate for testing Syrian golden hamsters have been used in some studies, especially when considering a specific mode of action (PPAR -alpha, etc.) where the hamster is more similar to humans toxic kine tically and dynamically, and have also been used in studies of carcinogenesis in the respiratory and urinary tract, particularly using parenteral routes such as intraperitoneal and intratracheal installation. In addition it should be noted that a number of tumor types are considered to be species -specific or strain - specific tumors with no relevance for humans (ECHA, 2009) . In any case weight of evidence analysis must show differences in modes of actions among test species and humans and sufficient strength of evidence considering historical control data. Assessment by international scientific bodies may facilitate acceptance as test species - specific tumorigenicity. 140. It is important to consider the general sensitivity of the test animals, their background pathology and hence the responsiveness of particular organs and tissues to the chemicals under test when selecting rodent species, strains or stocks for toxicity studies. In general the selected rodent strain or stock should be well -characterized preferably i ncluding data on e.g. body and organ weight, haematological and biochemical parameters and background pathology. Additionally, it is important that test animals come from healthy colonies. Normally Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) animals are used, being SPF d erived at birth and maintained under barrier conditions. Rodent species and strain specificity 141. Assessment of chronic toxicity in rodents using the Test Guideline 452 is generally carried out in the rat, although other rodent species, e.g., the mouse, m ay be used. Since the duration of the study is normally 12 months, the potential for development of age - related background pathologies that may be influenced by the strain of rat is lessened, and in practice the strain commonly in use in the testing labora tory will be used, since the laboratory will have historical data that will aid in the interpretation of any test substance -related change. 142. As already indicated, assessment of carcinogenic potential has traditionally been carried out in both rats and mice , particularly in the case of pharmaceuticals, pesticides and veterinary drugs, for which there is potential for widespread human exposure, either directly (pharmaceuticals) or via food and water. Hamsters may also be used. Common rat strains used in toxi cological testing include the Fischer 344, Sprague -Dawley and Wistar rat, and genetic typing enables characterization of a range of different sub - strains within these main strains. 143. The Fischer 344 rat is a particularly well -characterised rat strain in ca rcinogenicity studies, since it has been the selected rat strain for the National Toxicology Programme 62 (NTP) studies for over 20 years, together with the B6C3F1 mouse. However it has recently been reported (King -Herbert et al. 2010) that the NTP is current ly evaluating the Harlan Sprague Dawley (Hsd: Sprague Dawley SD) as the primary rat model for NTP studies, due to a number of health issues and decreased fecundity inherent in the Fischer 344 rat, and has carried out a number of long -term studies with this strain. 144. Importantly, in selecting a suitable rat strain for carcinogenicity testing, test animals should be selected that are likely to survive for the recommended duration of the study (see section 3.3.2). Britton et al (2004) reported that of the thre e rat strains studied (Harlan Hsd:Sprague -Dawley SD, Harlan Wistar Hsd:BrlHan:WIST, Charles River Crl:CD), Harlan Wistar strain survived in much greater numbers in 104 -week carcinogenicity studies. The improved survival rate, according to the authors, appe ared to be independent of body weight and food consumption and was reflected in the spontaneous pathology profile. Other authors believe this phenomenon to be attributable to a combination of obesity and genetic susceptibility and advocate dietary restrict ion as a method of extending survival in long -term carcinogenicity bioassays (Keenan, 1996). 145. As discussed further in section 3.5, and as reported by many investigators, dietary restriction results in a delay in age -related degenerative diseases such as nep hropathy, which is commonly seen in all rat strains and has been shown to be diet -related. Dietary restriction may however result in a lower susceptibility of the animals to the development of tumours in carcinogenicity studies and to development of chemic ally- induced toxicity, thus presenting problems in extrapolation of the results of such studies to humans. (See paragraph 196, section 3.5 for further information). 146. Mouse strains used in carcinogenicity testing include the B6C3F1 mouse, as used by NTP, the ICR Swiss (CD -1), BALB/c. The B6C3F1 remains the mouse model used in the NTP cancer bioassay, but the use of multiple strains of mice is being explored by NTP (King -Herbert et al. 2010). The CD -1 mouse has been used by the US EPA OPP for chronic long term toxicity studies. Notably, different mouse inbred strains show a variation in susceptibility to tumorigenesis in different organs. The commonly used strains, in particular the B6C3F1 mouse used by NTP, carry hepatocellular tumour susceptibility loci that result in a high susceptibility to chemically induced hepatocarcinogenesis (Gariboldi et al. 1993; Manenti et al. 1994), which has limited their usefulness in carcinogenicity testing, while CD -1, an outbred mouse line derived from the Swiss strain has a r elatively high incidence of spontaneous lung tumours and a high susceptibility to chemically induced lung tumorigenesis (Manenti et al. 2003). 147. In recent years there has been considerable debate about the value of the two rodent species approach to carcinog enicity and about the continued use of the mouse as a second species, within the ICH (ICH, Proceedings of the Third International Conference, 1995 ) and in other fora (e.g. Huff and Haseman, 1991; Gold and Stone, 1993; Ennever et al., 2003; Cohen, 2004, Bil lington et al., 2010; Storer et al, 2010). A number of studies have assessed t he relative individual contribution of rat and mouse carcinogenicity studies and whether the use of rats or mice alone, or alternatively the reduced protocol using male rats and female mice would result in a significant loss of information on carcinogenicity relevant to human risk assessment . This debate has led to the suggestion that there may be no need for routine conduct of two long -term rodent carcinogenicity studies, since the use of the mouse in carcinogenicity testing may have limited utility (References above, also Griffiths et al. 1994, Usui et al, 1996, 63 Carmichael et al. 1997; Meyer, 2003, Doe et al., 2006). However, testing in a second species is still acceptable, and is required under some current regulatory programmes. 148. Other e xperimental approaches to the evaluation of carcinogenic potential have been recommended, that may obviate the requirement to test in a second species (see also paragraphs 161 onwards). These ap proaches include short or medium -term in vivo rodent test systems providing insight into carcinogenic endpoints, such as models of initiation -promotion in rodents, or models of carcinogenesis using transgenic or neonatal rodents. Numbers and sex of anim als to be used in rodent studies 149. The Test Guidelines TG 451, TG 452 and TG 453 specify the core number of animals to be used in chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. In a stand -alone chronic toxicity study, the core number indicated is normally at least 20 animals of each sex per group. Additional animals may also be included in the study design for interim kills during the study, also satellite animals for investigation of reversibility of any toxicological changes and sentinel animals for investig ation of disease status. Smaller numbers of animals per sex and dose group are acceptable for these purposes, as indicated in TG 452. It is unlikely that a regulatory authority would find a study using a lower core number of animals per sex and per group acceptable for regulatory purposes, unless a robust scientific justification is provided, since a sufficient number of animals should be used so that a thorough biological and statistical evaluation can be carried out. The key issues of importance in car rying out a statistical evaluation of the results of a chronic toxicity study are discussed further in chapter 4 of this Guidance Document. In the case of a combined chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity study, there is provision for a smaller number of an imals (at least 10 per sex and per group) to be used in the chronic toxicity phase, since interpretation of the data from the reduced number of animals per group in the chronic toxicity phase of this combined study will be supported by the data from the la rger number of animals in the carcinogenicity phase of the study. 150. Similarly, TG 451 on the conduct of a carcinogenicity study specifies that at least 50 animals of each sex per dose group should be used, plus a concurrent control. Again, i t is unlikely tha t a regulatory authority would find a study using a lower core number of animals per sex and per group acceptable for regulatory purposes, since a sufficient number of animals should be used so that a thorough biological and statistical evaluation can be c arried out. It is however possible to increase numbers of animals in all groups, in particular the lower dose groups, in order to increase the sensitivity of the study. In general use of additional numbers of animals above the 50 males and 50 females per g roup indicated in the TG for carcinogenicity testing (OECD 451 and 453) has to be justified,considering e.g. animal strain, survival rate and statistical power. This is discussed further in chapter 4. However, a number of publications have indicated that survivability problems exist for ce rtain strains, notably the Sprague - Dawley rat ( Nohynek et al., 1993; Keenan, 1996). For strains w ith poor survival such as Sprague Dawley rats, higher numbers of animals per group may be needed in order to maximise the d uration of treatment (typically at least 65/sex/group). 64 3.3.2 Testing in non -rodents, including considerations of numbers of animals to be used 151. The use of non -rodent species may be considered when available data suggest that they are more relevant for the prediction of health effects in humans. Non -rodents are used generally only for chronic toxicity testing and not for carcinogenicity testing. The principles and procedures outlined in t his Guidance Document, together with those outlined in OECD TG 409, Repeated Dose 90 -day Oral Toxicity Study in Non -Rodents (OECD, 1998) should be applied, with appropriate modifications. The use of non- rodent species should be, in the main, restricted to special purpose studies, rather than for basic screening of chronic toxicity. As indicated in the Test Guideline, a second, non-rodent species should only be used: where effects observed in other studies indicate a need for clarification/characterisation in a second species, or where toxicokinetic/toxicodynamic studies i ndicate that the use of a specific non - rodent species is the most relevant choice of laboratory animal, or where other specific reasons justify the use of a non -rodent species. 152. As already indicated in paragraph 137, the dog has been a commonly used non -rodent species in chronic toxicity studies in the past, although several regulatory regimes have now discontinued this requirement. There has been extensive debate about the need for, and added -value of, chronic toxicity studies in the dog (Box and Spielmann , 2005, Doe et al., 2006, ESAC, 2006, EFSA 2007; Kobel at al, 2010). As a result of analyses carried out by these authors and also by the US EPA (Baetcke et al. , 2005), it has been suggested that tests using typical non -rodent species, such as the dog, do not have a substantial added value beyond a duration of 3 months. 153. Dogs used for chronic toxicity testing should be of a defined breed. Beagles are the most commonly used dog strain. The study design should minimise the numbers of animals used, and for a c hronic toxicity study normally 4 -6 animals per dose level are used. Dosing should begin preferably at four to six months and not later than nine months of age. Of particular importance when using dogs for toxicity testing, are considerations of appropriat e housing, exercise, the need for environmental enrichment and for social contact. These aspects are discussed further in Chapter 3. 5. 154. Other non -rodent species used include mini -pigs, as their basic physiology is considered to be very similar to humans, a nd they may therefore provide a better model than e.g. dogs or rodents. Rabbits, although used in the area of skin and eye irritation testing and reproductive toxicity testing, are rarely if ever used as a second species for chronic toxicity and carcinogen icity testing, and their use is therefore not discussed further in this Guidance Document. The use of non -human primates is now contraindicated and in 2007 the European Parliament called for a phase out of all use of primates in medical research and toxici ty testing. However, in Europe, the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) came to the conclusion that for many areas of biomedical research including toxicity testing in its entirety, there are no valid alternatives which would all ow the complete discontinuation of the use of non- human primates at this time (SHER, 2009). Their use should always be rigorously justified. 155. Minipigs used for chronic toxicity testing should be of a defined breed. G\u00f8ttingen Minipigs are the most commonly used minipig strain used. The study design should 65 minimise the numbers of animals used, and for a chronic toxicity study normally 4 -6 animals per dose level are used. Dosing should begin preferably at three to four months of age. Where the study is conduc ted as a preliminary to a long -term chronic toxicity study, the same species/breed should be used in both studies. Animal welfare considerations are of the utmost importance when using minipigs for toxicity testing, including housing, exercise, the need fo r environmental enrichment and for social contact. These aspects are discussed further in Chapter 3. 5. 3.3.3 Study duration 156. The duration of the chronic toxicity study and of the chronic toxicity phase in the combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity st udy is normally 12 months, although longer or shor ter periods may be used if scientifically justified, and for pharmaceuticals, chronic studies of 6 month s duration in rats are required . 157. In the carcinogenicity study, mice are generally exposed to the test chemical for 18 -24 months and rats for 24 -30 months with exposure being longer for strains of greater longevity or with a lower spontaneous tumour rate The Test Guideline 451 specifies that the duration of the study will normally be 24 months for rodents, representing the majority of the normal life span of the animals to be used. Shorter or longer study durations may be used, dependent on the lifespan of the strain of the animal species in the study, but should be justified. For specific strains of mice, e .g., AKR/J, C3H/J, CD - 1 or C57BL/6J strains, a duration of 18 months may be more appropriate, but should be justified by reference data from historical controls. Many carcinogenicity studies in mice are conducted for 18 months; therefore, there is limited historical control data available at 24 months. The study may also make provision for interim kills, e.g., at 12 months, to provide information on progression of neoplastic changes and mechanistic information, if scientifically justified. Where such infor mation is already available from previous repeat dose toxicity studies on the substance, interim kills may not be scientifically justified. 158. Termination of the study should be considered when the number of survivors in the lower dose groups or the control group falls below 25 per cent, considering the s urvival of each sex separately. The US EPA Health Effects Test Guidelines 870.4200 (US EPA, 1998b) specify that survival in any group should not fall below 50% at 15 months in the case of mice and 18 months in the case of rats, or below 25% at 18 and 24 months respectively. In addition, the WHO (1990) has recognised a further type of carcinogenicity study that continues until mortality in the most susceptible group reaches a fixed level, usually 80%. 159. The stud y should not normally be extended beyond the point when the data available from the study are no longer sufficient to enable a statistically valid evaluation to be made. However, in the case where only the high dose group dies prematurely for obvious reaso ns of toxicity, this should not trigger termination. While the validity of the study may be prejudiced by early mortality, e.g. in the high dose group, valuable information will still be obtained from it, and a decision to terminate the study in its entire ty must be carefully weighed against the animal welfare implications of having to repeat the study. The lower dose groups, in particular, the next highest dose level, when continued to the scheduled end of the study may still be useful for the evaluation. 66 160. If the current dosing regime results in severe animal toxicity and the study must be terminated before the full duration of exposure, the study sponsor needs to contact the regulatory authority immediately. All data should be compiled and all available t issues preserved for further evaluation. While this study may not meet all guideline requirements for long term/carcinogenicity testing, the results may be useful and considered in the overall risk assessment. The determination of a retest will be made on a case -by-case basis by the regulatory authorities. Consideration of the acceptability of a negative carcinogenicity result relative to survival in the study. 161. For a negative result to be acceptable in a rat carcinogenicity bioassay, survival in the study should ideally be no less than 50% at 24 months. It is the responsibility of the study director to use rat strains that would ensure adequate survival at 24 months. In a mouse study, survival in all groups in the study should be no less than 50% in all groups at 18 months. Additionally, no more than 10% of any group should be lost due to autolysis, cannibalism, or management problems. Survival of less than 50% of animals in the top dose group need not disqualify the evaluation of a negative study outcome, provided that the higher mortality in this group can be clearly attributed to another toxic effect, such as chronic undernutrition or malabsorption resulting from gastrointestinal irritation by too high a dietary concentration of the test substance . Evalu ation of a negative study outcome may be based on calculation of the power of the test for groups with lower mortality. A broad general guideline is that at interim sacrifice, survival should not be below 50%, while for life span studies at study termin ation beyond 18 and 24 months survival should not be less than 25%. 3.3.4 Alternative in vivo models for carcinogenicity testing, including testing in transgenic animals 162. Some of the medium -term tests for carcinogenicity involve the development of prolifer ative lesions in a single tissue, e.g. foci of alteration in the liver (Williams et al. , 1982; Goldsworthy et al. , 1986; Ito et al. 1989). Others use tumour end -points, such as induction of lung adenomas in the A -strain mouse (Maronpot et al. , 1986) or in duction of tumours in initiation -promotion studies using various organs, including the skin, bladder, intestine, liver, lung, mammary gland and thyroid (see reviews by Enzmann et al., 1998a & 1998b; IARC, 1992 & 1999). A further category of study is the start/stop protocol. Here, an agent is administered for a limited period to induce particular effects or lesions; the progression or reversibility of these is then observed in the absence of further treatment (Todd, 1986; Marsman & Popp, 1984). 163. Transgenic assays in genetically engineered rodents have also been developed following the identification of genes, such as proto -oncogenes and tumour -suppressor genes that are highly conserved across species and associated with a wide variety of human and animal can cers. They involve activated oncogenes that are introduced (transgenic) or tumour suppressor genes that are deleted (knocked out). If appropriate genes are selected, these assay systems may provide information on mechanisms of tumour formation or serve as selective tests for carcinogens. The modified transgene is expected to accelerate carcinogen -induced cancer development without interfering with other relevant genetic and/or epigenetic steps. High spontaneous tumour incidence in 67 control animals is a major confounding factor of the conventional bioassay; the presence of the transgene itself does not induce high spontaneous tumour incidence in the short time span of the assay. These assays have been extensively reviewed in publications, including a single -theme issue of Toxicological Pathology (26 (4), 1998) and others The transgenic mouse model has not yet been fully validated or accepted by most national an d international validation organizations (e.g., Scientific Advisory Committee on Alternative Toxicological Methods of the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods) or testing laboratories. Although at this time, there is no large repository of historical control data to establish baseline parameters, work is currently on -going towards validation and the development of an OECD Test Guideline on Transgenic Rodent in vivo Gene Mutation Assays based on a Detailed Review Paper that was published in 2009 (OECD, 2009). This document provides a comprehensive review of the transgenic rodent mutation assay literature and assesses the potential use of these assays in a regulatory context. 165. Transgenic mouse models appear to have usefuln ess as hazard identification screening models as part of an initial phase of the risk assessment process. However, they are not definitive proof of potential human carcinogenicity, and they are not proof of a specific mechanism of action. Like the 2 -year b ioassay, the results from tests in these models need to be incorporated into an overall integrated, weight of evidence evaluation for a given compound that takes into account genotoxicity, particularly DNA reactivity, structure activity relationships, resu lts from other bioassays, and the results of other mechanistic investigations including toxicokinetics, metabolism, and mechanistic information (ICH, Proceedings of the Third International Conference,1995; Meyer, 2003; NAS, 2007; Phang W & Dellarco V.

Mutat Res 97: 359-370. 72 3.4 TOXICOKINETICS Studies examining the toxicokinetics (TK) of a c hemical substance are conducted to obtain adequate information on its absorption, distribution, biotransformation (i.e. metabolism) and excretion, to aid in relating concentration or dose to the observed toxicity, and to aid in understanding its mechanism of toxicity (OECD, 2010). Basic TK parameters determined from these studies will also provide information on the potential for accumulation of the test substance in tissues and/or organs and the potential for induction of biotransformation as a result of e xposure to the test substance (OECD, 2010). Toxicokinetic studies may provide useful information for determining dose levels for toxicity studies (linear vs. non -linear kinetics), route of administration effects, bioavailability including differences in si ngle versus repeat dose, internal dose, metabolism pathways and whether a point of saturation exist and a reactive intermediate can be formed and issues related to study design. 167. The specific objectives of a toxicokinetic study, as an adjunct to a chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity study, include the following (ICH, 1994): to describe the systemic exposure achieved in animals and its relationship to dose level and the time course of the toxicity study. to relate the exposure achieved in toxicity studies to toxicological findings and to contribute to the assessment of the relevance of these findings for other species i.e. humans/extrapolation. to provide information which, in conjunction with the toxicity findings, contributes to the design of subsequent t oxicity studies including studies on MOA. 168. For the purpose of dose selection, TK studies are informative in indicating whether there is a point of saturation\" or saturation kinetics evident in the dose response curve . They may also indicate a dose at which all biochemical changes plateau and doses above which such changes are not informative to the toxicity profile. 169. The kinetics of absorption will determine the internal exposure dose achieved. The absorption and clearance of the compound and its metabolite s will determine the systemic and target organ exposure resulting from a single dose and can be used to design the treatment regimen required to achieve a desired internal dose. The effect of repeated exposures on absorption, metabolism, biotransformation, and clearance of a compound will provide information on the internal dose achieved during chronic exposure under conditions of the bioassay. 170. The nutritional status of animals exposed chronically to a test substance may be affected during the experimental period; thus, information on potential interactions between the test chemical and nutritionally important dietary constituents may be of value in the interpretation of the final results of the chronic study i.e. it may help to distinguish between a direc t adverse effect and an effect due to possible interaction with essential dietary constituents leading to nutritional deficits. 171. As indicated in OECD TG 417 on Toxicokinetics (OECD, 2010), there are numerous studies that might be performed to evaluate the TK behaviour of a chemical for 73 regulatory purposes. However, depending on particular regulatory needs or situations, not all of these possible studies may be necessary for the evaluation of a chemical. Flexibility, taking into consideration the characteris tics of the substance being investigated, is needed in the design of toxicokinetic studies. In some cases, only a certain set of questions may need to be explored in order to address chemical -associated hazard and risk concerns. In some situations, TK data can be collected as part of the evaluation in other toxicology studies. For other situations, additional and/or more extensive TK studies may be necessary, depending on regulatory needs and/or if new questions arise as part of chemical evaluation. 172. In orde r to be of maximum utility in planning the design of a chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity study, particularly in the selection of dose levels, TK studies should be carried out, or data should be available, in the same species used in the long -term study and should preferably be performed using the same route and, where appropriate, the same vehicle as that used in the other toxicity studies. It should be noted however that such data may not be readily available for all chemicals, as they are not required u nder all regulatory schemes. 173. While single dose TK studies may provide useful information on absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the test substance, the information most relevant in the planning and the execution of a chronic toxicity or c arcinogenicity study will come from a repeat -dose toxicokinetic study over an extended period. As noted in OECD TG 417, repeated administration of the test substance may be needed to address more fully the potential for accumulation and/or persistence or changes in TK, or as required by a competent authority. 174. In addition to data from toxicokinetic studies (e.g. OECD TG 417), useful for among others in designing of longer term studies information on repeat -dose toxicokinetics may be generated as part of a chronic toxicity (TG 452) or carcinogenicity (TG 451) study, or the combined chronic toxicity/carcinogenicity study (TG 453). In the case of rodent studies, additional animals, typi cally satellite animals, while not necessary, may be included in the stud y design for the purpose of providing excreta and blood samples for toxicokinetic analysis, if considered appropriate (Saghir et al 2006 & 2009). Quantity of test substance excreted in urine, feces, and expired air should be measured on at least two time p oints on day 1 of collection (one of which should be at 24 hours post-dose), and daily thereafter until the experiment is terminated. Blood samples should be taken from the satellite animals (and also in the case of an independent TK study) at suitable tim e points. The volume and number of blood samples which can be obtained per animal may be limited by potential effects of repeated sampling on animal health and/or physiology and the sensitivity of the analytical method. Comparison of the area -under -curve ( AUC) on Day 1 and the last day is used to indicate accumulation, or not. 175. Guidance on toxicokinetic investigations following administration of test substance by the dermal or inhalation route(s) is given in the OECD TG417. 176. With respect to plasma levels of the test chemical measured in toxicity studies, an important point to note is that in rats there is a marked influence of sex hormones on liver biotransformation processes (see e.g. Chhabra & Fouts, 1974). In general, male rats metabolise xenobiotics (as well as endogenous substrates) faster than females, a finding not generally seen in other species. Thus rat studies may exhibit sex differences 74 in plasma kinetics and in clinical and toxicological effects of the test chemical. These findings may not be rel evant to human exposure. 177. As indicated in OECD TG 417 on Toxicokinetics (OECD, 2010), all available information on the test substance and relevant metabolites and analogs should be considered by the testing laboratory prior to conducting an additional toxi cokinetic study in order to enhance study quality and minimise animal usage. This could include data from other relevant test methods ( in vivo studies, in vitro studies , and/or in properties, such as water solubility, vapour pressure, and molecular weight of a chemical may be useful for study planning and interpretation of results. They can be determined using appropriate methods as described in the relevan t OECD Test Guidelines. 178. The draft revised TG 417 also provides guidance on use of supplemental approaches in addition to the in vivo studies described in the preceding paragraphs that can provide useful information on absorption, distribution, metabolism a nd excretion (OECD, 2010). For example, use of freshly isolated or cultured hepatocytes and subcellular fractions (e.g. microsomes and cytosol or S9 fraction) from liver can provide useful information on metabolism of the test substance. Local metabolism i n the target organ, e.g. lung, may be of interest for risk assessment. For these purposes, microsomal fractions of target tissues may be useful. Studies with microsomes may be useful to address potential gender and life -stage differences and characterize e nzyme parameters (Km and Vmax) which can aid in the assessment of dose dependency of metabolism in relation to exposure levels. In addition microsomes may be useful to identify the specific microsomal enzymes involved in the metabolism of the substance whi ch can be relevant in species extrapolation. 179. The potential for induction of biotransformation can also be examined by using liver subcellular fractions (e.g., microsomes and cytosol) of animals pretreated with the substance of interest, in vitro via hepat ocyte induction studies or from specific cell lines expressing relevant enzymes (OECD, 2010). In certain circumstances and under appropriate conditions, subcellular fractions coming from human tissues might be considered for use in determining potential sp ecies differences in biotransformation. Primary cell cultures from liver cells and fresh tissue slices may be used to address similar questions as with liver microsomes. In certain cases, it may be possible to answer specific questions using cell lines wit h defined expression of the relevant enzyme or engineered cell lines. In certain cases, it may be useful to study the inhibition and induction of specific cytochrome P450 isozymes (e.g., CYP1A2, 2A1, and others) and/or phase II enzymes by the parent compou nd using in vitro studies. Information obtained may have utility for similarly structured compounds (OECD, 2010). 180. The results from in vitro investigations may also have utility in the development of PBTK models (Loizou et al., 2008), see also paragraphs 181 and 182. In vitro dermal absorption studies may provide supplemental information to characterize absorption (OECD, 2004). 181. Toxicokinetic models such as PBTK modelling may have utility for various aspects of hazard and risk assessment as for example in th e prediction of systemic exposure and internal tissue dose. A PBTK model comprises an independent structural mathematical 75 model, comprising the tissues and organs of the body with each perfused by, and connected via, the blood circulatory system. PBTK mode lling may be used to predict the target tissue dose of the parent chemical or its reactive metabolite. Information derived from PBTK mode lling experiments may aid in the comparison of biotransformation and pharmacokinetics of a test substance and/or its me tabolites and may provide a basis for extrapolation across species or dosing patterns. Such experiments may also provide estimates of relevant internal tissue dose which might be important to the hazard or risk assessment process (Andersen, 2003; US EPA 2 006; Nielsen et al. 2008, Clewel and Clewel, 2008). Furthermore, specific questions on mode of action (see chapter 2) may be addressed, and these models can provide a basis for extrapolation across species, routes of exposure or dosing patterns. Use of the approach must however be adequately validated against experimental data and must be justified. 182. Data useful for developing PBTK models for a chemical in any given species include 1) partition coefficients, 2) biochemical constants and physiological parame ters, 3) route - specific absorption parameters and 4) in vivo kinetic data for model evaluation (e.g. clearance parameters for relevant (> 10 %) excretion pathways, Km and Vmax for metabolism) (OECD, 2010). The experimental data used in model development sh ould be generated with scientifically sound methods and the model results validated. Chemical - and species -specific parameters such as absorption rates, blood -tissue partitioning and metabolic rate constants are often determined to facilitate development of non -compartmental or physiologically -based models (IPCS, 2010). 183. The ICH guidance on the Assessment of Systemic Exposure in Toxicity Studies provides additional guidance on the value of TK data in dose selection in carcinogenicity studies (ICH, 1994). The ICH guidance emphasises the need to estimate systemic exposure to the parent compound and/or metabolite(s) at appropriate dose levels via TK studies and at various stages of a carcinogenicity study, in order to ensure that the findings of the study can be interpreted in relation to the comparative exposure for the animal model and humans. The guidance notes that increases in exposure may arise unexpectedly as a result of non -linear kinetics due to saturation of a clearance process. Increasing exposure ma y also occur during the course of a study for those compounds which have a particularly long plasma half -life. With particular reference to administration of the test compound by oral gavage careful attention should also be paid to compounds which achieve high Cmax values over comparatively short time periods within the dosing interval. Conversely, unexpectedly low internal doses may occur during a study as a result of enzyme induction over time.

An overarching principle is that the particular needs of given species and strains must take precedence and that adherence to guidelines should never replace close observation of the particular animals involved, continued throughout their lives (Council of Europe, 1997). Provision of exhaustive guidelines for all species and strains is difficult to achieve and local initiatives for improving housing conditions should be taken whenever possible. Appendix A of the Council of Europe Convention Guidelines for accommodation and care of animals, does however provide detailed guidance on these issues, including aspects such as design and maintenance of the test facilities ( Appendix A, Council of Europe, 2006). It should be consulted for in -depth information. 3.5.1 Housing 186. Taken as an example, the Council of Europe Convention (Appendix A, 2006) states on housing that special relevance should be given to the enrichment of the environment of the respective species according to their needs for social interaction, activity -related use of the space, appropriate stimuli and materials. In a review of laboratory environments and rodents' behavioural needs, Balcombe (2006) note s that there is growing recognition of the inherent problems of depriving rodents the space and resources to carry out natural behaviours, such as exploring, foraging, running, escaping hiding and hygiene maintenance. The author reports a recent survey of animal facilities at the US National Institutes of Health which indicates that a slight majority of rats and mice at these facilities are now being provided with nesting and structural (shelter) enrichment (Hutchinson et al. 2005). Other indicators that ro dent housing conditions are improving include the availability of commercially produced resources for nesting, shelter, gnawing and play (Key 2004), and a sharp rise since the late 1980s in the number of citations using keywords environmental enrichment' and rodent' (Hutchinson et al. 2005). Considering that two decades ago environmental rodent enrichment was scarcely being discussed, the author notes that these are laudable trends (Balcombe, 2006). 187. The Council of Europe Convention Appendix A (2006) recom mendations on housing for rodents are as follows: Rodent species other than guinea pigs should be kept in cages made of easy to clean material and their design should allow proper inspection of the animals without unnecessarily disturbing them; 78 The cages s hould be provided with solid floors with bedding instead of grid floors, unless there is good reason to have alternatives; Gregarious species should normally be group -housed, although it may be difficult to achieve stable and harmonious groups of male mice , and also female hamsters; Where the experimental procedures or welfare requirements make group -housing impossible, consideration should be given to accommodating animals of the same species within sight, sound or smell of one another; Encouragement shoul d be given to break up the interior space of a cage by introducing objects such as platforms, tubes, boxes, etc. and attempts should be made to provide environmental enrichment with objects to explore, carry or transform, unless negative effects are observ ed on welfare or on the intended scientific use; High hygiene standards should be maintained. However, it may be advisable to maintain odour patterns left by the animals; Special attention should be paid to ensuring that the lighting intensity particularly on the top row of cages is not too high. Maximum light intensity should not exceed 350 Lux measured 1 metre from the floor. Provision should be made for shaded areas within the cage to allow the animals to withdraw. 188. The Convention makes specific recommend ations for size of caging and stocking densities, dependent on the size/weight of the animals. In relation to environmental conditions, the Convention provides specific recommendations for temperature, humidity and ventilation for each species of laborator y animal covered in the guidelines. Those for rodents are in line with those indicated in the OECD Test Guidelines, as outlined in the next paragraph. 189. The Test Guidelines make some specific recommendations for housing of rodents only, including the recomm endation (in line with that of the Convention) that animals may be housed individually e.g. when the test substance is administered via the dermal route, in order to prevent grooming behavio urs and oral ingestion, or be caged in small groups of the same se x; individual housing should be considered only if scientifically justified. Animals may be group -caged by sex, but the number of animals per cage must not interfere with clear observation of each animal. The biological properties of the test substance or toxic effects may indicate a need for individual caging. Rodents should be housed individually in dermal studies and during exposure in inhalation studies. 190. The Test Guidelines also specify that cages should be arranged in such a way that possible effects d ue to cage placement are minimised. For rodents, the temperature in the experimental animal room should be 22oC (\u00b1 3oC). Although the relative humidity should be at least 30% and preferably not exceed 70% other than during room cleaning, the aim should be 50-60%. Lighting should be artificial, the sequence being 12 hours light, 12 hours dark. These recommendations, together with those of the Convention should be applied in any rodent chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity study conducted according to the Test Guidelines. 191. As indicated in Chapter 3.3, although rodents (rats or mice) are the main species used in chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity studies, other species, dog in particular, may be used 79 on some occasions. As for rodents, specific guidelines for the care of dogs including housing, feeding health and handling have been developed, e.g. Council of Europe (2006). In relation to the housing of dogs, the Council of Europe Convention recommends that: Dogs should be housed in socially harmonious groups, unles s the experimental procedures or welfare requirements make this impossible; Dogs should be exercised at least daily. Under no circumstances should dogs be caged without exercise for more than 14 days. Preferably, dogs should be exercised with other dogs. Dog pens should allow some privacy for the animals. They should include playthings and structures, including elevated platforms. Solid floors should be used for dogs. The materials, design and construction of slatted or perforated floors should provide su rfaces which do not produce welfare problems such as irritation or injury of the feet or toes, blistering, etc. (these must be prevented at all times), and should supply a solid resting area. Temperature in dog studies should be held within a range of 15 -21oC, light period between 10 and 12 hours a day, and humidity 40 -70%. 3.5.2 Feeding 192. In both humans and laboratory animals, diet has a direct bearing on health, and many neoplastic and non -neoplastic diseases are caused (or prevented) by dietary factors, including variations in the composition and amount of feed consumed. The association in rats of caloric consumption, the spontaneous formation of tumours and life span is well established. Although the zero -dose group may be expected to control for the influence of diet, dietary constituents may still profoundly affect the outcome of an experiment ( OECD, 2002) . 193. A nutritionally -balanced diet is important both for the welfare of laboratory animals and to ensure that experimental results are not biased by uni ntentional nutritional factors (NRC 1995). The US National Research Council provides detailed guidance on the nutritional requirements of a wide range of laboratory animals, with detailed information on essential nutrients and other considerations for each species (NRC, 1995). The NRC guidance emphasizes that feed palatability and intake, nutrient absorption and utilization, and excretion can be affected by physicochemical characteristics of feeds such as physical form, sensory properties, naturally -occurri ng refractory or anti -nutritive substances, chemical contaminants, and conditions of storage (NRC, 1995). Many biological factors also affect nutritional requirements, including genetic differences between species and strains, stage of life of the animals, environmental influences (e.g. diurnal rhythms, temperature etc.), housing and microbiological status (NRC, 1995). Detailed information is also given on diet formulation for natural -ingredient diets, purified and chemically -defined diets, and on manufactu re and storage procedures and other considerations (NRC, 1995). 80 194. The Test Guidelines state that rodents should be fed and watered ad libitum with food replaced at least weekly. Conventional laboratory diets should normally be used/ are normally used. The d iet should meet all the nutritional requirements of the species tested and the content of dietary contaminants, including but not limited to pesticide residues, persistent organic pollutants, phytoestrogens, heavy metals and mycotoxins, that might influenc e the outcome of the test, should be as low as possible. Control and test animals should be fed from the same batch and lot. Analytical information on the nutrient and dietary contaminant levels should be generated periodically, at the beginning of the st udy and whenever there is a change in the batch used, and should be included in the final report. Analytical information on the drinking water used in the study should similarly be provided. The choice of diet may be influenced by the need to ensure a sui table admixture of a test substance in the diet and to meet the nutritional requirements of the animals when the test substance is administered by the dietary route. 195. As noted in section 3.2.1 , the concentration of the test substance in the feed should not normally exceed an upper limit of 5% of the total diet (FDA, 1982, Borzelleca, 1992), although higher levels are feasible (e.g. when testing carbohydrates or proteins) as long as the diet is adapted to be nutritionally adequately, e.g. incorporated, at th e expense of other components, in a purified diet. Section 3.2.1 also discusses the problems associated with the palatability of diet (or drinking water) containing test substances affecting the taste and/or smell of the food. If this is marked, it may be necessary to introduce into the study design an additional control group, pair fed (i.e. having matched food intake) in parallel with the high dietary level test group. 196. An important aspect of the feeding regime used in chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity is the recognized effect on study outcome of feeding ad libitum . Traditionally, maximal growth and reproduction have been used as criteria for the evaluation of laboratory animal diets (NRC, 1995). However, evidence from a number of studies indicates that restricting the caloric intake of laboratory animals may have beneficial effects on life span, the incidence and severity of degenerative diseases, and the onset and incidence of neoplasia (Weindruch and Walford, 1988; Yu, 1994; Keenan et al. 1997). Based on these results, allowing animals to eat ad libitum to produce maximum growth and reproduction may not be consistent with objectives of long -term toxicological and aging studies (NRC, 1995). Overfeeding by ad libitum food consumption is generally conside red to be the most significant, uncontrolled variable affecting the outcome of the current rodent bioassay, and in particular, the correlation of food consumption, the resultant adult body weight and the 2 -year survival in Sprague -Dawley rats is highly significant. (Keenan et al., 1997). However, it will probably take years to introduce dietary restriction into national and international test guidelines for toxicity testing because of concern that the delayed occurrence of, for example, cancer reflects a decrease in the sensitivity of the carcinogenicity test in detecting the carcinogenic potential of tested chemical and because the considerable database on historical control is based on data from ad libitum feeding studies (Meyer et al, 2003). Species and s train differences in survival are discussed further in chapter 3.3. 197. At a practical (experimental) level however, restriction of the caloric intake of laboratory animals is not straightforward. It may disrupt normal diurnal eating rhythms and is not compat ible with group housing. It is also important to achieve caloric restriction of test animals without producing unintended nutrient deficiencies (NRC, 81 1995). Elevation of nutrient concentrations in the diet may be necessary to ensure that the nutrient intak e of animals whose eating is restricted is comparable to that of animals allowed to eat ad libitum. There is, however, relatively little information available about the extent to which caloric restriction affects nutrient requirements (NRC, 1995). Since ra ts regulate their food intake according to caloric intake, the mineral and vitamin etc. content of the diet should be adjusted to caloric density . 198. As already noted, t he US National Research Council provides detailed guidance on the nutritional requireme nts of a wide range of species other than laboratory rodents, including dogs and rabbits (NRC, 1995). In the case of a chronic toxicity or carcinogenicity study involving animals other than rodents, this guidance should be consulted for information regardi ng feeding. 3.5.3 Handling, Health Surveillance and Experimental Procedures 199. The quality of care provided in the laboratory may influence not only growth rate and welfare, but also the quality and outcome of experimental procedures ( Council of Europe Conve ntion 2006) . The animals should be accustomed to competent and confident handling during routine husbandry and procedures; this will reduce stress both to animals and personnel. In particular, for non -rodent species such as dogs, animals should be handled or be in social contact with humans on a regular basis. The behaviour of an animal during handling and the performance of experimental procedures depend to a considerable extent on the confidence and competence of its handler. Good technique should be unhu rried, sympathetic and gentle but firm and safe for the animal and operator. All personnel should be appropriately educated and trained, and records of training maintained. 200. A strategy should be in place in all establishments to ensure that an appropriate h ealth status is maintained, which safeguards animal welfare and meets scientific requirements (Council of Europe Convention 2006) . This strategy should include a microbiological surveillance programme, plans for dealing with health breakdowns, and should d efine health parameters and procedures for the introduction of new animals, e.g. quarantining. Supervision of the accommodation and care by a veterinarian or other competent person is essential. 201. In relation to the experimental phase of a chronic toxicity o r carcinogenicity study, as indicated in the Test Guidelines, the animals selected for the study should have been acclimated to laboratory conditions for at least 7 days and should not have been subjected to previous experimental procedures. A period of ac climatisation is needed to allow animals to recover from transport stress, to become accustomed to a new environment and to husbandry and care practices, and to ensure that their health status is sound. The test animals should be characterised as to specie s, strain, source , sex, weight and age. Each animal should be assigned a unique identification number, and permanently marked with this number by tattooing, microchip implant, or other suitable method. The method chosen should be reliable and cause the min imum pain and discomfort to the animal when applied and in the long -term. Staff should be trained in carrying out the identification and marking techniques, and sedatives or local anaesthetics and analgesics should be used if necessary. 82 202. At the commencement of the study, the weight variation for each sex of animal used should be minimal and not exceed \u00b1 20 % of the mean weight of all the animals within the study, separately for each sex. Animals should be randomly assigned to the control and treatment groups . After randomisation, there should be no significant differences in mean body weights between groups within each sex. If there are statistically significant differences, then the randomisation step should be repeated, if possible. 203. The animals should be in spected regularly throughout the study, at least daily by a trained person, to ensure that all sick or injured animals are identified and appropriate action taken. Regular health monitoring should be carried out. The Test Guidelines specify that a ll animal s should be checked for morbidity or mortality, usually at the beginning and the end of each day . Animals should additionally be checked once a day following dosing in the case of gavage studies, for specific signs of toxicological relevance, taking into c onsideration the peak period of anticipated effects after dosing in the case of gavage administration. Particular attention should be paid to tumour development. The time of tumour onset, location, dimensions, appearance, and progression of each grossly vi sible or palpable tumour should be recorded. Body weights and food/water consumption and food efficiency should be assessed and recorded at the intervals specified in the guidelines. 204. At the end of the study, for interim kills and in the case of animals fo und sick or moribund during the study, the animals should be humanely killed. For non -scheduled killing i.e. for animals showing clinical sign of pain, suffering or distress, OECD Guidance Document 19 on the Recognition, Assessment, and Use of Clinical Sig ns as Humane Endpoint for Experimental Animals Used in Safety Evaluations should be followed (OECD, 2000). All humane methods of killing animals require expertise, which can only be attained by appropriate training. Animals should be killed using a method that adheres to the principles set by the European Commission Recommendations for the euthanasia of experimental animals (Part 1 and Part 2) (EEC, 1986). A deeply unconscious animal can be exsanguinated, but drugs which paralyse muscles before unconsciousn ess occurs, drugs with curariform effects and electrocution without passage of current through the brain, should not be used without prior anaesthesia. Disposal should not be allowed until death has been confirmed. 205. Records of source, use and final disposal of all animals bred, kept for breeding, or for subsequent supply for use in scientific procedures should be used not only for statistical purposes but, in conjunction with health and breeding records, as indicators of animal welfare and for husbandry and planning purposes. 83 REFERENCES Balcome JP (2006) Laboratory environments and rodents' behavioural needs, a review.

This Chapter on investigations includes guidance on the design and conduct of pathological, histopathological and ophthalmoscopic investigations together with more general advice on the avoidance of bias during investigations. Sponsors and study directors should consider this guidance when planning and performing studies to reduce the likelihood of misleading or ambivalent findings that could result in inappropriate conclusions or the need to repeat studies., and on the optimal use of animal s for generation of data. It complements existing Guidance contained in OECD Guidance Document No. 35 on the analysis and evaluation of chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. Guidance Document 35 should be consulted for detailed guidance on mortal ity, clinical observations, body weight changes, food and water consumption, absolute and relative organ weights, haematological, clinical and urinary measurements, post mortem observations and analysis of toxicokinetic and metabolism data. The Society of Toxicologic Pathology recommendations for organ weights have also been published (Sellers et al 2007) . 207. Ophthalmoscopy is an extremely useful clinical technique that allows examination of the anterior and posterior of the eyeball (fundus), including the re tina, optic disc, choroid, and blood vessels in the eye. Ophthalmoscopy can help to detect diseases of the eye, to diagnose other conditions or diseases that damage the eye, and can detect other diseases such as some brain tumours. In life ophthalmoscopy allows the progression of the disease to be followed in time and can indicate that additional sampling at necropsy would be informative. 208. Histopathology evaluation is an important part of the assessment of the adverse effects of chemicals on the whole organ ism. Conventional histological, histochemical and special staining techniques, together with electron microscopy can be used both to define the identity and morphology of tissue, cellular and subcellular structures and to indicate the chemical characterist ics of their constituents. In addition to conventional special staining techniques and electron microscopy, new techniques involving immunohistochemistry, molecular biology and novel visualisation procedures can be applied to provide additional more object ive methods Information from such investigations can be used to obtain better functional and morphological characterisation of induced alterations in tissues of the body, when needed. 3.6.2 Ophthalmoscopy 209. In toxicity studies, ophthalmoscopic evaluation s hould be conducted by a suitably trained and experienced individual, preferably using indirect fundoscopic examination and a slit -lamp evaluation. A topical mydryatic agent will normally be employed to facilitate ophthalmoscopic examination. 210. Animals shoul d be examined pre -treatment and pre -terminally. Preferably, they will also be examined at least once during the course of the study. Dependent upon the nature of any abnormalities observed, additional ophthalmoscopic examination or other clinical investiga tions may be warranted. Ocular abnormalities may indicate additional 86 tissue sampling at postmortem to enable histological examination of the ocular adnexa. When ocular abnormalities are detected by ophthalmoscopy and treatment -related causes cannot be co nfidently excluded, histopathological examination of the eye should attempt to identify the morphological correlate of the abnormality. If ocular abnormalities are focal, it may be appropriate to perform histological examination on additional sections. Ap propriate sections from all groups should be taken to provide adequate controls. 211. The study report should contain an integrated interpretation of all treatment -related ocular findings (ophthalmoscopic, macroscopic and microscopic examinations), along with p ertinent individual animal data. 212. It should be noted that rodent models are not suitable for the detection of disturbances of ocular pressure by tonometry or for monitoring for certain visual disturbances, such as dyschromatopsia. 3.6.3 Pathology and His topathology 3.6.3.1 General Considerations. 213. Pathology has an important role in toxicology since it provides information on the differences in tissue and organ morphology that establish the presence or absence of lesions and whether or not there are dose -effect relationships. Pathology data can facilitate the interpretation of other data, such as organ weight changes, clinical biochemistry or haematology findings ( e.g. Krinke et al. , 1991), and evaluators should always make it clear whether there are any as sociations between pathological abnormalities and other findings of physiological significance. Nevertheless, not all changes in tissue morphology are accompanied by abnormalities in other parameters, and perturbation in organ biochemistry will not necessa rily be accompanied by changes in the histological appearance of the affected organ(s). An overview of physiological and environmental factors that can complicate the interpretation of findings in a toxicity study may be found in the Handbook of Toxicologi c Pathology (Bucci, 1991). 3.6.3.2 Sampling 214. The pathologist should ensure that standard sections of all appropriate tissues and organs are present on the slides to be evaluated. The use of standard sections helps to ensure comparable samples across all a nimals, thus reducing inconsistency. If flawed or incomplete specimens (eg. missing medulla of adrenal, pars distalis intestine, the parathyroid), impair the pathologist's ability to detect, or evaluate treatment -related effects, it is the pathologist's responsibility to obtain recuts, to the extent possible, of those missing or inadequate tissues. Any irretrievable omissions should be taken into account in the interpretation of the data and discussed in the pathology narrative. 215. Procedures for tissue sampling and trimming to ensure optimal fixation, vary between laboratories. However, more standardised approaches to the selection of blocks, orientation of tissues and number of slides examined for rat and mouse organs and 87 tissues in re gulatory type toxicity studies are now available (Ruel -Fehlert et al., 2003; Kittel et al., 2004 and Morawietz et al., 2004) and are recommended. These publications are based on the experience of the European Registry of Industrial Toxicology Animal -Data (RITA) and North American Control Animal Database (NACAD). They are an extended revision of the trimming guidelines published by Bahnemann et al. (1995). The articles describe in detail the optimum localisation for tissue preparation, the sample size, the direction of sectioning and the number of sections to be prepared, organ by organ. However, existing information on the substances tested and gross findings at autopsy may indicate that samples from non standard locations should also be taken. If a test su bstance is administered by the dermal route or by inhalation route for example, samples should be taken from the site of application, in addition to the standard specimens. 3.6.3.3 Histopathology specimen processing and quality 216. High quality tissue specim ens are necessary for histopathologic evaluation. For routine purposes, fixation in a suitable concentration of a formalin solution followed by processing and embedding in paraffin wax, and cutting of a suitable thickness of histological section is adequat e for most tissues. Exceptions are the eyes and testes for which formalin is generally regarded as an inadequate fixative. In these instances, Bouin's or Davidson's fixatives are preferable, especially if evidence from shorter term studies indicated treatm ent-related testicular or ocular toxicity. Bouin's fluid is generally considered the best fixative for testis although there has been a move away from this because of the safety concerns of its picric acid content (Latendresse et al., 2002). Formalin, when used under stringent conditions is usually also a good fixative for many immunohistochemical and molecular biological techniques on tissue sections. Frozen sections are however usually needed for studies of enzyme activity or those requiring intact RNA. T issues should be processed in a manner that reduces the potential for variation to be introduced among groups, as indicated in Section 3.6.5. 217. Special stains should be used where appropriate. Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) remains the most widely used stain, supplemented, where appropriate by a Romanovsky stain for haemopoietic cells, Periodic -acid Schiff (PAS) stain for hepatic glycogen, glomerular basement membrane and the acrosome on testicular germ cells, trichrome and elastic stains for the myocardium, an d blood vessels and oil red O applied to frozen sections for neutral lipids. While still not standard, immunohistochemical techniques are now widely used in special cases and the advantages and pitfalls of the techniques are discussed in detail by Greaves (2009). All specially stained tissues should be accompanied by a specimen known to be positive for the particular test to confirm the proper functioning of the technique. 218. The use of larger semi -thin (1 to 3 \u00b5m thick) plastic or resin embedded sections is a technically demanding but cost effective compromise between electron microscopy and conventional light microscopy. It requires specialist equipment frequently not present in routine histology laboratories. Sometimes termed high resolution light microsco py', light microscopic evaluation of semi -thin sections provides a means of avoiding extensive use of the electron microscope because it can locate cytoplasmic organelles in a way sometimes not possible in a paraffin wax embedded material. 88 219. All slides eval uated should be identified with a unique code from which identifies the study number, animal number, and slide (block) number and the tissue[s] present on the slide. 220. In view of the hazard to health of formalin, used for fixation, and xylene, used during processing, an increasing number of laboratories are adopting technologies which are free of both formalin and xylene. Nassiri et al. (2008) describes the utilization of a formalin -free fixation and processing system for tissue detection of two important biomarkers in breast cancer at the RNA and protein levels. Falkeholm et al. (2001) demonstrated that xylene -free histological sections are qualitatively on a par with conventional paraffin sections for routine diagnostic work. Overall, these techniques appea r to have good safety profiles, provide excellent histology quality and are suitable for further analysis by immunohistochemistry and nucleic acid extraction. There can however be subtle differences between xylene -free and xylene sections thus the patholog ist should be aware of the potential for these differences especially when reading between studies on the same compound where one study uses sections using xylene and the other is xylene -free. 221. In addition to histopathology and immunohistochemistry, tissue may be required for molecular genomic or transcriptomic analysis of biomarkers. This should be borne in mind when collecting and studying tissue. It is important therefore to be prepared to extract RNA, DNA and even protein from paraffin embedded material. This can be achieved using both formalin -containing and formalin -free fixed tissues. Hewitt et al. (2008) summarizes the current state -of-the-art of preanalytic factors in tissue handling and processing as they impact the quality of RNA obtainable from fo rmalin fixed paraffin -embedded tissue. 222. Artefacts may be produced at each of the following stages in the processing of tissue sections: before death, at postmortem or necropsy, during the fixation of tissues, during processing, paraffin embedding and microt omy, during the mounting of tissue sections onto glass slides, staining procedures and coverslipping. Some artefacts are easily distinguishable from normal or diseased tissue components but these render the task of the pathologist more difficult and great care should be taken to avoid their introduction. Some artefacts are difficult to distinguish from pathological changes and are thus of particular concern. McInnes (2005) sets out some of the more common artefacts that are most frequently encountered as a result of inadequacies in the preparation of microscopic tissue sections. 3.6.3.4 Histopathologic evaluation 223. Details of the nature of the test substance, results of any previous toxicity studies and known activities of this class of compounds should b e made available to the pathologist before evaluation of the tissue slides begins. Knowledge of target organs and tissues and the types of changes previously encountered, even in different species, facilitates the evaluation of tissues and provides for the consistent use of terminology. Previous knowledge of target tissues should be utilized during the protocol development to determine whether special pathology procedures should be used in obtaining, fixing, processing, or staining of sections. 89 224. The study pa thologist should have access to in -life clinical observations, organ and body weight data, haematology and clinical biochemistry data, and macroscopic findings of the postmortem examination for each animal in addition to complete information about the expe rimental design, characteristics of the animal (age, sex and strain) and husbandry of the study population. These include, but are not necessarily limited to: study protocol, including amendments and relevant deviations, species, strain, and age of animal s, route, doses, and duration of dosing. 225. Metabolic, pharmacokinetic, or toxicokinetic information may be necessary for understanding patterns of change and interpreting differences in species responses. 226. In-life data (i.e., clinical signs, body weight cha nges, food consumption, ophthalmoscope findings etc.) from animals may help greatly in the identification of target organs and in understanding mechanisms of toxicity. Haematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis results also aid the identification of t arget organs and may contribute to an understanding of the mechanism of action. Results of special assays, such as hormone concentrations or enzyme induction, are equally important in locating morphologic changes and in the understanding of their significa nce. 227. Necropsy (gross) findings for individual animals must be available to the pathologist for lesion tracking and correlation with histopathology findings. The pathologist should also be aware of organ weight changes. Often histomorphologic correlates of altered weights can be identified. 228. All of the above -mentioned data, if available, should be provided to the pathologist at the time of the initial slide evaluation. Provision of information on previous findings for the individual animals may render the t reatment status of the animal obvious. The pathologist may wish to examine samples from animals of the same treatment group for the same histopathological changes. This may improve the efficiency of the process but comes at the price of inevitably introd ucing the potential for bias into the process. Careful consideration needs to be given to the balance between ensuring that subtle or rare changes are detected and the possible introduction of bias. This is discussed further in section 3.6.5. 229. Tissues may be evaluated animal by animal or organ by organ as the preference of the pathologist dictates. The animal by animal technique affords an encompassing overview of an animal's complete health status. The organ by organ technique allows more focused attentio n to changes and aids in the consistent grading of changes in a particular organ. Where concise terminology is inadequate to convey lesion complexity, detailed free text descriptions should be used to define the diagnostic term used for tabulation. 230. For co mmon lesions in a species or strain of animal, it is important to know if the experimental treatment alters severity. The pathologist should use a severity grading system that allows for an appropriate severity classification, as treatment may affect the incidence (number of animals showing the pathology) or the severity of a particular pathology lesion. Toxicological lesions are frequently found in a continuous spectrum of severity. Therefore, severity grading systems should be: 1) definable, 2) reproducib le, and 3) meaningful. A description of each of the various grades should be included in the narrative for target lesions where severity is critical to interpretation of the data. Photomicrographs may be helpful in conveying the severity differences for th e 90 grading system used. Well -defined severity grading systems greatly aid the pathology peer-review process. For carcinogenicity studies, it is the pathologist's responsibility to distinguish between hyperplasia, dysplasia, neoplasia and to classify tumours , where applicable, as 1) benign or malignant, and 2) primary or metastatic. 231. Computerised systems of recording findings help to organise the process of evaluation and ensure that all animals and all tissues have been examined, and that gross and microsco pical correlation is followed. They also allow rapid, and reproducible, formation of the pathology tables needed to ensure appropriate interpretation of treatment -related effects. 3.6.3.5 Procedures to enhance the accuracy and consistency of histopatholo gy 232. Histopathology is a descriptive and interpretive science and therefore includes an element of subjectivity. However, the pathologist should evaluate tissues as consistently as possible to avoid the introduction of artificial differences or between - group bias. Evaluation of all tissues within a study by one pathologist with consistent standards for detecting, naming, and grading tissue changes, facilitates the detection of differences induced by treatment. However, two or more pathologists are on rare occasions involved in evaluation of a study. In such circumstances, the utmost care must be taken to ensure that nomenclature and severity grading systems used by the contributing pathologists are harmonized to limit variation and that steps are taken to avoid bias (see section 3.6.5). For example, the situation where all of the samples in one dose group are evaluated by one pathologist and those in another dose group by another pathologist should be avoided. Standardized criteria and consistent terminolo gy should be agreed upon for grading systems of common spontaneous and treatment -related findings. The use of a shared computer system that can define a study -specific lexicon for capturing data facilitates this process. Guidance on standard nomenclature is available in OECD Guidance No. 35. 233. Pathologists are aware of the phenomenon of diagnostic drift. Drift refers to a gradual change in nomenclature or severity grading of lesions within a single study. Diagnostic drift usually develops from the incre ased awareness of a lesion by the pathologist and it is more of a problem in large studies with many animals and tissues requiring evaluation over a prolonged period of time. It is a source of inconsistency that can negatively impact detection of treatment -related lesions or artefactually introduce apparent treatment -related effects where none exist and can erroneously affect the determination of no -effect -levels. When a pathologist becomes aware of drift in his/her selection of terminology or severity grad ing, he/she must re -evaluate the tissue(s) involved. Any suspected treatment -related effects should normally be re -evaluated through the use of a blinding or masking technique, where appropriate. 3.6.3.6 Image Capture 234. It is useful to capture images of key features, both as an aide memoire but also as a means of sharing with other pathologists, thus reducing problems of diagnostic drift. Rather than relying solely upon subjective opinions consideration should be given to use of quantitative morphometry for morphological features, where possible, for 91 example in metabolic bone studies, and the accurate quantitation of protein expression detected by immunofluorescence. 3.6.3.7 Peer Review of histopathology 235. Peer review increases confidence in the accuracy o f the histopathology findings from a study. Peer review by an independent pathologist is essential to ensure consistency of the histopathological findings in any studies but in particular those evaluated by more than one pathologist. The objectives of a fo rmal histopathology peer review are several: 1) determine accuracy and consistency of nomenclature i.e., survey for the presence of incorrectly diagnosed or inaccurately described treatment -related lesions, 2) determine completeness; i.e., survey for the p resence of undiagnosed treatment -related lesions, 3) determine the appropriateness of the NOEL, NOAEL or other point of departure, e.g. BMDLx, by reviewing all target tissues and organs, and 4) review the correctness of the textual interpretations derived from those data. The methods employed may vary depending on the purpose of the peer review. For a routine peer review, tissues from a sufficient number of treated animals need to be evaluated to assure that significant lesions were not missed and that a n o effect level can be verified. 236. A number of procedures can be used for peer review (Eighmy, 1996; Peters, 1996; The Society of Toxicologic Pathologists, 1991 and 1997). Peer reviews are generally included in the study protocol and are conducted prior to the issuance of the study report (Ward et al., 1995). It is important that the original plan for the review process include a joint review by the original and reviewing pathologist of the two sets of results to explain or resolve apparent differences, shou ld they occur. The results of the peer review should be documented and archived and any differences of opinion resolved through consensus. This procedure is then part of the process that leads to finalizing diagnoses and interpretations. 237. If any differenc es cannot be resolved through a joint review of the data, then arbitration through a third pathologist should take place or the problem referred to a pathology working group (PWG) or to a panel of expert consultants for resolution. Contingency plans to allow for this should also be included in the original study plan. A Pathology Working Group (PWG) may be formed to review, revise and/or interpret diagnoses (Peters, 1996; The Society of Toxicologic Pathologists, 1991) and this should be done prior to fi nalising the report. The PWG should be composed of individuals having expertise both in the pathology of the test species and with the specific lesion in question. The PWG may include both the original and the reviewing pathologist but the diagnoses of bot h the original and the reviewing pathologist should not be known to the other PWG members. Prior to beginning work, a PWG chairman is appointed who directs the focus of the PWG and orchestrates agreement of the criteria used to make the diagnoses of the le sions in question. For impartiality reasons, neither the original pathologist nor the reviewer pathologist should be nominated as chairman (Mann P.C., 1996). This process should be clearly defined and documented. The PWG may request additional sections fro m tissues to aid with the diagnostic process of the peer review. Following slide examination by the PWG in a blinded fashion and tabulation of the results; the findings of the PWG are compared to those of the original pathologist. When the consensus of the PWG is clearly different from that of the original pathologist, the diagnosis for an individual lesion should be changed. When 92 there is a close split on a vote of a diagnosis, however, the diagnosis of the original pathologist should be allowed to stand. The records of the PWG should indicate the final diagnoses for each lesion and the degree of certainty of the diagnoses. 238. Regardless of its exact form, the peer review process should encourage direct interaction between the original and the reviewing pathol ogist and should result in the production of a single, scientifically robust pathology report that appropriately and accurately summarises the results and any uncertainties. The process should be constructive, meet the needs and objectives of the review an d have an inbuilt procedure for resolving differences, should they arise. 239. Retrospective peer reviews by a single pathologist or a PWG may also be undertaken after the completion of a study. This type of peer review is necessary when unexpected issues are h ighlighted after a study is finalised and additional work is needed to clarify the issue. In these exceptional circumstances, where the conclusions of the study may change for example, it is necessary to take steps to ensure that the original report is marked to indicate that a revision of the final conclusions has occurred. A separate report or a report amendment may be appropriate and any changes must be documented as required by GLP. 3.6.3.8 Early Death Investigations 240. Guidance on the interpretation of early deaths is provided in Guidance document 35. In this chapter further guidance on investigations that are valuable is provided. 241. In accordance with OECD Guidance (GD 19), the earliest possible endpoints that are indicators of distress, severe pain, or i mpending death should be used as indications for humanely killing the animals prior to them reaching a moribund state or dying. GD19 was developed largely for animal welfare reasons. However, this practice also has the advantage or reducing the number of animals that are found dead with the accompanying risk of loss of tissues from autolysis or cannibalism. It also avoids confusing direct effects of the test substance with secondary effects resulting from post - mortem or moribund changes. 242. Reasonable effo rts should be made to determine the cause, or likely cause, of individual deaths or severe toxicity leading to euthanasia. It is important to identify causes unrelated to exposure to the test agent ( e.g. acute or chronic infections, age or disease -related degenerative processes, anatomical abnormalities, mishandling or accident) from toxicity -induced effects. All in -life data, as well as the results of the post mortem, of euthanized or dead animals in a study, should be used in an attempt to make this disti nction. 243. Assignment of the cause of death or of severe toxicity, leading to euthanasia is a component of the assessment of carcinogenicity studies in rodents, which is widely practised to aid statistical evaluation (Kodell et al., 1995). The US National Cen tre for Toxicological Research (NCTR) requests routine assignment of cause of death for all dead and moribund animals examined histologically in carcinogenicity studies. A determination as to whether a particular tumour under consideration was fatal to an animal or was simply an incidental finding at necropsy is important for determining the 93 type of information that an individual animal contributes to age -adjusted statistical tests for carcinogenic effects (Peto et al., 1995). 244. Organ weights from animals tha t die or are euthanized prior to scheduled necropsy are of little value in most cases to the overall study because of differences in nutritional status and tissue congestion and oedema secondary to the health status of the animal. The absence of matched c oncurrent control data further hinders interpretation of organ weights from animals that die or are euthanized prior to termination of the study. They can however be useful in indicating a potential cause of death in the individual animal and should theref ore still be taken at necropsy. 245. An experienced pathologist should, under appropriate conditions, be able to distinguish peri - and post -mortem changes in tissues from treatment -related effects on tissues. While cannibalism can inhibit accurate pathology e valuation it is almost always useful to fix and block tissues from all animals, even those found dead, since different tissues show different degrees of autolytic change in death and conclusions can often be made even when some time has elapsed between dea th and tissue sampling. 3.6.3.9 P athology Final Conclusions 246. A final pathology/histopathology conclusion is reached when the following have been achieved: 1) histopathologic diagnosis and description of all findings for each animal on the study, 2) the di agnoses and descriptions reflecting the consensus of a peer review, if a peer review was done prospectively, 3) tabular summary data providing an accurate representation of the findings, 4) a NOEL, NOAEL, or other point of departure, e.g. BMDLx, if appropr iate. Final conclusions and diagnoses may often be the result of an iterative process in which the diagnosis is continually refined and modified until a final conclusion can be reached. This process may include taking additional samples for evaluation. Details of areas of disagreement and/or uncertainty that arose during the study and how these were resolved should be documented. The final pathology report must accurately and completely present the data and their interpretation. Benign and malignant neo plasms of the same cell type are sometimes combined because one is seen as the progression of the other, but benign and malignant lesions should always be presented separately, because combination may result in a loss of sensitivity if the substance tested accelerates the progression to malignancy, since the increase in malignant neoplasms is balanced by a decrease in benign neoplasms. Therefore, whilst combined data may eventually be useful, the pathology narrative should be full and precise to prevent mi sinterpretation or doubts over the interpretation. Statistical analysis should be performed on the combined incidence of tumours (benign & malignant) of the same histogenetic origin, even when those tumours are in different tissues: So for example, the in cidence of lipoma & liposarcoma should be combined across all tissues, as should the overall incidence of vascular and fibromatous tumours and tumours of other connective tissue types. 247. The narrative of the final pathology report should address all the sign ificant pathology findings and any group differences. Background pathology and other underlying conditions such as infections or the presence of incidental lesions in both control and treated animals should also be reported. There should be precise descrip tions of any 94 treatment -related findings and their likely importance. Clear reasons for concluding that any observations are unrelated to treatment or are not biologically or toxicologically significant should also be provided (Morton et al., 2006). 3.6.4 Supplementary Investigations 248. Previous knowledge of the effects of the substance may indicate that non -standard investigations would be of value in the interpretation of the results. Samples for such investigations should be taken and stored appropriate ly, provided that this does not jeopardise the basic requirements of the study. Such supplementary sampling would not thus invalidate the study as an OECD -compliant study according to the test guideline. Findings in the initial standard investigations ma y raise further questions that may be addressed by supplementary studies if appropriate stored samples are available. 3.6.5 Avoiding bias 249. Bias can arise if samples or observations in one group differ from those in another group for any reason other than t reatment with the test substance. Therefore it is important that steps are taken to prevent the introduction of bias throughout the whole study and not restricted to the randomisation of animals to the treatment groups at the beginning of the study. Bias can be introduced whenever the operator or observer, equipment used or the timing of investigations are confounded with treatment group. The study design should minimise such effects by use of randomisation or a well balanced investigation scheme. 250. Random isation should be done formally, not semi -subjectively. There are several methods for performing the randomisation process. The most commonly used is a computerised algorithm, but card assignment and the use of a random number table may also be used. Rando misation is normally used for the sequence of necropsy and can also be used for the sequence of other investigations. Similarly, if different operators or observers and equipment are used for the same investigation, randomisation should be used to prevent confounding with the treatment group. A well balanced investigation scheme can be used instead of randomisation for investigations. 251. Re-randomisation of samples is not necessary at each stage of the study and an initial randomisation or well balanced inve stigation scheme can be re -used throughout the study investigations. Slides are not normally randomised for histopathologic evaluation; slides from the control and highest dose groups are usually evaluated before other groups. The benefits and drawbacks of blinding or masking samples for histopathological evaluation are discussed below. 252. Subjective evaluations, such as clinical signs and histopathology are susceptible to bias if the evaluator is aware of the treatment group to which the individual animal or slide belongs. Blinded or masked evaluation is carried out without prior knowledge of treatment group, which could include untreated or other control groups as a mechanism to minimize the introduction of observational bias. Blinded/masked evaluation is a more rigorous scientific approach to assessment. 95 253. For the evaluation of clinical signs, the absolute masking of the treatment group for individual animals is practically difficult as animals within one cage are usually from the same treatment group. H owever, blinding of the evaluator should be maintained to the extent possible without jeopardising other aspects of the study, particularly by increasing the risk of errors in dosing or animal identification. 254. Appropriate blinding procedures should be consi dered by the pathologist before, during, and after the microscopic evaluation of tissues. Blinding need not prevent the pathologist being provided with detailed information of other observations in the study, including animal -specific findings (see Sectio n 3.6.3.4). The foremost objection to blinded slide evaluation in the initial histopathological examination is loss of knowledge of the range of normal that exists in known controls. This may be particularly pertinent for studies on new chemical entities or in new species, where little is known about potential treatment -related effects and their background frequency in control animals. Without this baseline, subtle differences between treated and control groups may be difficult to detect. Knowledge of the treatment group also allows the pathologist to assess the spectrum of related morphological changes and determine the most appropriate diagnostic terminology, including combining related diagnoses where indicated. However, these advantages must be weighe d against the inevitable bias introduced by non -blinded evaluations. If an initial non -blinded examination is carried out to allow the recognition of treatment -related findings, subsequent masked evaluations of target tissues can be very helpful because it ensures an unbiased determination of a NOEL (no -observable -effect -level), or other point of departure. 255. Randomisation, well balanced investigation scheme and blinding or masking procedures employed to minimise bias in investigations should be described in the protocol and study report. 3.6.6 Data Archives 256. Archiving of documents and specimens generated during a non -clinical laboratory study is a fundamental Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) requirement. The records and material that should be archived as well as the characteristics and the organisation of archive facilities are addressed in the OECD series on Principles of Good Laboratory Practice No. 1 (1997) and the OECD GLP document 15 (2007). Each kind of material has its own individual requirements for pr oper storage and may have different retention times. Materials should be retained for the period specified by the appropriate authorities. 257. Raw data are defined in the OECD series on Principles of Good Laboratory Practice No. 1 (1997) as \"all original test facility records and documentation, or verified copies thereof, which are the results of the original observations and activities in a study. Raw data also may include, for example, photographs, microfilm or microfiche copies, computer readable media, dict ated observations, records data from automated instruments, or any other data storage medium that has been recognised as capable of providing secure storage of information for a time period as stated in section 10\". 258. Any computerised system used to collect or store histopathology data should be GLP compliant. .A variety of security measures will have been incorporated into each of 96 these computer systems to ensure both data integrity throughout the process of histopathology data collection and reporting and t o ensure that any changes made after the pathology contribution has been locked are recorded, and that an audit trail for the changes, including who made them and when, is kept. These security controls include: limited user access, single and/or multiple p assword requirements, procedural controls and technical controls built into the systems. A critical requirement of an audit trail is a record of any change to the data. 97 REFERENCES Abdo KM, Kari FW (1997).

Definitions/glossary will be added from Chapter 2, Chapter 3.1 and as gaps are identified by the WNT and Expert Group . ADI/TDI: Acceptable daily intake/Tolerable daily intake: the amount of a test article in food or drinking water that can be ingested (orally) over a lifetime without an appreciable health r isk. Adverse Effect : Change in the morphology, physiology, growth, development, reproduction or life span of an organism, system, or (sub) population that results in an impairment of functional capacity, an impairment of the capacity to compensate for additional stress, or an increase in susceptibility to other influences. AUC : Area Under the Curve (Area under the plasma concentration -time curve): Area under the curve in a plot of c oncentration of substance in plasma over time. Benchmark dose (BMD): The dose corresponding to a small specified increase in effect over the background level. BMDL: is the lower confidence limit of BMD (see above) Typically, BMDL1 (with a response rate s et at 1%) or BMDL10 (with a response rate set at 10%) is selected). Bioaccumulation: the accumulation of the test article in an exposed organism. Bioaccumulation occurs when an organism absorbs a test article at a rate greater than that at which it is excr eted. Bioavailability: Fraction of an administered dose that reaches the systemic circulation or is made available at the site of physiological activity. Carcinogenicity: Substances are defined as carcinogenic if they induce tumours (benign or malignant), increase its incidence or shorten the time of tumour, when inhaled, ingested, dermally applied or injected. Chronic Toxicity : Toxicity (adverse effect) after an exposure period of 12 months or longer due to a test article that has been ingested inhaled, d ermally applied or injected. Detoxification pathways: Series of steps leading to the elimination of toxic substances from the body, either by metabolic change or excretion. Dose: Total amount of a test article administered to, taken up by, or absorbed by an organism, system, or (sub) population. 104 Dose -response: Relationship between the amount of an agent administered to, taken up by, or absorbed by an organism, system, or (sub) population and the change developed in that organism, system, or (sub) populat ion in reaction to the agent. Extrapolation: Inference of one or more unknown values on the basis of that which is known or has been observed. Exposure: Concentration or amount of the test article that reaches a target organism, system, or (sub) populati on in a specific frequency for a defined duration. Genotoxic/genotoxicity: A deleterious action on a cell's genetic material affecting its integrity. GLP : Good Laboratory Practice Induction/Enzyme induction: Enzyme synthesis in response to an environmenta l stimulus or inducer molecule; Hazard: The inherent property of a test article to cause adverse effects when an organism, system, or (sub) population is exposed to that test article. Hazard identification : The identification of the type and nature of ad verse effects that an agent has as inherent capacity to cause in an organism, system or (sub) population. Mechanism of Action: The individual biochemical and physiological events leading to a toxic effect). MOA : Mode of Action: the processes by which a ch emical induces toxicity. A MOA can inform about relevance of observed effects in laboratory animals to humans and the variability of response within the human population. Local effect: Adverse effect at the site of first contact (e.g. skin, eye, mucous membrane/gastro -intestinal tract, or mucous membrane/respiratory tract). MTD : Maximum Tolerated Dose MTC : Maximum Tolerated Concentration NOAEC : No -Observed - Adverse -Effect -Concentration. The highest concentration of a test article to which an organism is exposed, that does not cause any observed and statistically significant adverse effects on the organism compared with the controls. NOAEL : No-Observed - Adverse -Effect -Level. The highest level of a test substance to which an organism is exposed, that does n ot cause any observed and statistically significant adverse effects on the organism compared with the controls. NOEL : No-Observed -Effect -Level Palatability/ decrease in palatability : Acceptable to the taste, sufficient agreeable to be eaten/reduced taste(? ) / makes the food less aggreable due to organoleptic changes e.g. change in odor/flavor leading to reduced food intake. 105 POD : Point of Departure: The dose -response point that marks the beginning of a low -dose extrapolation. This point is most often the up per bound on an observed incidence or on an estimated incidence from a dose -response model. QSAR : Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship Read -across: The endpoint information for one or more chemicals is used to make prediction of the endpoint for t he target chemical i.e. use of structure similarity analysis to identify analogous compounds to determine whether there may be opportunities to bridge databases for one chemically structurally similar compound to another. Reference dose: An estimate of a daily exposure to a chemical that is unlikely to cause harmful effects during a lifetime. Route of administration (oral, IV, dermal, inhalation, etc.): Refers to the means by which substances are administered to the body (e.g., orally by gavage, orally by diet, dermal, by inhalation, intravenously, etc). Route -to-route extrapolation: The prediction of an equivalent dose and dosing regime that produces the same toxic endpoint or response as that obtained for a given dose and dosing regime by another route . SAR : Structure Activity Relationship Systemic effect: A toxicological effect that affects the entire body or many organs. Systems Modeling: (Pharmacokinetic -based, Physiologically -based Pharmacokinetic, Biologically -based, etc.): Abstract model that use s mathematical language to describe the behaviour of a system. Target tissue: Tissue in which the principal adverse effect of a toxicant is manifested. Threshold: Dose or exposure concentration of an agent below which a stated effect is not observed or e xpected to occur. Toxicity: Inherent property of an agent to cause an adverse biological effect. Toxicodynamics: the p rocesses of interaction of toxicologically active substances with target sites, and the biochemical and physiological consequences lead ing to adverse effects i.e. the way in which the chemical substance behaves/interacts within the biological system to cause toxicity Toxicokinetics (Pharmacokinetics) : A term describing the processes of chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, and e xcretion in the organism (ADME) i.e. the way in which the chemical substance is absorbed, moves within the body and are "}
