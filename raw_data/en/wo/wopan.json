Long-acting beta 2-adrenergic agonists the active ingredient in SEREVENT DISKUS , increase the risk of asthma -related death (see WARNINGS AND PREC AUTIONS ). Use of SEREVENT DISKU Sfor the treatment of asthma without concomitant use of an inhaled cort icosteroid; a long -term asthma control medication; is contraindi (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ).Use SEREVENT DISK USonly as add -on therapy for patients with asthma who are currentlytaking but are inadequately controlled on an inhaled corticosteroid. Once asthma control is ac hieved and maintained, assess the patient at regular inte rvals. If possible without los s ofasthma control, discontinue SEREVENT DISKUS and maintain the patienton an inhaled corticosteroid; a long -term asthma control medicatio n. Do not use SEREVENT DISKUS for patients whose asthm a isadequately controlled on lo w or medium dose inhaled corticosteroids. SEREVENT DISKUS is a slow onse t, long-acting ,beta2-agonist and should not be us ed as a rescue medication. To relieve ac ute asthmatic sympt oms, a rapid onset, short duration inhaled bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) should be used. Pediatr ics and A dolescent Patients: Available data fro m co ntrolled c linical trials suggest that LABA inc rease the risk of asthma - related hospita lization in pediatr ic and adolescent patients (see WARNINGS AND PREC AUTIONS ). For pediatric and adolescent patients with as thma who requi re addition of a LABA to an inhaled corticosteroid, a fixed -dose combination p roduct containing both an inhaled corticost eroid and LABA should ordinarily be used to ensure adherence with both dru gs. In cases where use of a separate inhaled co rticosteroid a nd LABA is clinically indicated, appropriate steps must be taken to ensure adh erence with both t reatment components. If adheren ce cannot be assured, a fi xed-dose combination product containing bo th an inhaled corticosteroid and LABA is recomm SEREVENT DISKUS is indicated for: long t erm, twice daily (morning and e vening) administration in the maintenance treatment of bronchospasm and relief of dyspnea associated with COP D, includin g chronic bronchitis and emphysema. SEREV ENT DISKUS should be used as a rescue medicat ion.Page 5of 491.1 Pediatrics Pediatrics (< 4years of age): At present, there is insuf ficient clinical data to recommend the use of salmete rol xinafo ate in children younger than 4 yea rs of age. 1.2 Geriatrics There is no need to adjust the dose i notherwise healthy elder ly pat ients. 2CONTRA INDICA TIONS SEREVENT DISKUS is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to this drug or toany ing redient in the formulation , includ ing any non -medicinal ingredient or compo nent of the contain er and t o adrenergic compounds. For a complete listing, s ee 6 DOSAGE FORMS, STRENGT HS, COMPOSITION A ND PACKAGI n contain slactose (which contains milk protein) and is therefore contraindicated in patients with an allergy t o lactose or milk. Patients with a history of anaphyla ctic shock, anaphylactic reacti on or angioedema associated with salmeterol xinafoate or an y component of this drug. Because of the risk of asthma -related death and hospitalization, use of SEREVENT DISK USfor the t reatment of asthma without concom itant use of an inhaled corticosteroid; a long -term asthma control medication; is co ntraindicated (see WARNINGS AND P REC AUTIONS ).Page 6of 493SERIOUS WARNINGS A ND PRECA UTIONS BOX Serious Warnings and Precaution s ASTHMA TED DEATH Long-acting beta 2-adrener gic agonists SEREVENT DISKUS , increase the risk of asthma -relateddeath. Data from a large placebo controll edUS study that compared the safety of salmeterol (SE REVENT Inhalati on Aerosol) or placebo added topatients usual asthma therapy showed an incr ease in asthma -related deaths in pat ients receiving salmeterol (1 3 deaths out of 13, 176 p atients treated for 28 weeks on salm eterol versus 3 deaths out of 13, 179 pat ients on plac ebo). Post-hoc analysis of the SMART trial data suggests that the risks may b elower i n patients who were using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) atstudy entry. However, these post -hoc analys is results are not conclusive (see 14CLINICAL TRIALS : Salmeterol Mul ti-center Asthma Research Trial (SMART)). Cu rrently available clinical d ata are inadequat e to deter mine whether concur rent use of inhaled corticos teroids mitiga tes the increased risk of asthma -related death from LABA. Because of this risk, us e ofSEREVENT DISKUS for the treatment of asthma without concomitant us e of an in haled corticosteroi d; a long -term a s add-on therapy for pat ients with asthma who ar e current ly taking but are inadequately controlled on an inhale dcorticosteroid. Once asthma control is achiev ed and maintained, assess the patient at regular inter vals. If possible without loss of as thma c ontrol, discontinue SERE VENT DISKUS and maintain the patient on an inhaled cortic osteroid; a long -term asthma control medication. Do not u se SEREVENT DISKUS forpatients whose asthma is ad equately controlled on low or medium dose inhaled cortico steroids (s ee DOSAGE AND ADM INISTRATIO N). Pediatric an d Adolescent Patient s Available data from contro lled clinical trials sugg est that LABA increase the risk of asthma - related hosp italization in pediatric and ad olescent pa tients. For pediatric a nd adolescent patients wi thasthma who require add ition of a LAB A to an inhaled cort icosteroid, a fixed - dose com bination product containi ng both an inhaled cor ticost eroid and LABA sho uld ordinarily be considered to ensure adherence w ith both drugs. In case s where use o f a separate inhaled corticosteroid a nd LABA is cli nically indicated, a ppropriate steps must be taken to ensure adherence wi th both treatment comp onents . If adherence can not be assured, a fixed -dose combinatio n product c ontaining s salmeterol, the active ingredient in SEREVENT DISKUS , increase the risk of asthma -related d eath ( see WARNINGS AND PREC AUTIONS ).Because of t his risk, use of SEREVENT DISKUS for the treatment of asthma witho ut concomitant use of an inhaled corticosteroid, a long -term asthma c ontrol medicatio n, is cont raindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ).Use only as add -on therapy for pa tients with asthma wh o are currently taking but are inadequately contro lled o n an inh aled cortico steroid. Once a sthma control is ac hieved and maintained, ass ess the pat ientat regular intervals . If possi ble without loss of asthma control, discontinue SER EVENT DISKUS andmaintain the patient on an inhaled co rticosteroid , a lo ng-term ast hma control medicat ion. Do not use SEREVENT DISKUS for patients whose asthma is adequat ely controlled on low ormedium doseinhaled corticosteroids (see WARNINGS AND P REC AUTIONS ). Pediatricand A dolesce nt Patients (4 to 17 y ears of age): Available data from controlled clinical trials suggest that L ABA increase the risk ofasthma -related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. For patients wi th asthma less than 18 years of age w ho requ ire addition of a LABA to an i nhaled corticosteroid, a fixed -dose combination product containing both a n inhaled corticostero idand LABA s hould ordinarily be used to ensure adherence with both drug s.In cases wh ere use of a s eparate inhaled c orticosteroid and L ABA is clinically indica ted, appropriate steps must be taken to ensure adherence with both treatme nt components. If adhe rence cannot be assured, a fixed -dose combination product containing both an inhaled c orticosteroid and LABA is recom mended (see WARNINGS AND P REC AUTIONS ). At present, there are insufficient clinical data to rec omme nd the use of salmeterol xinafoate in children younger than 4 years of a ge. Based on ava ilable data, no adjustmen t of salmeterol dosage in pediatric p atien ts is warranted. In adolescents/children the severity of asthma may be varia ble with age and peri odicreassessm ent should be considered to determine if continued maintenance therapy with SE REVENT DISKUS is still indicate d. SEREVENT DISKUS (salmeterol xinafoate) should not be initiated in patient s with signif icantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma ,which may be a life -threatening condition (see WARNINGS A ND P REC AUTIONS ). SEREVENT DISKUS is not a replacement for inhaled or oral cor ticos teroid therapy ; its use is complementa rytoit. Patients must be warned not to stop or reduce anti - inflammatory ther apy (see CONTRA INDICA TIONS ). SEREVENT DISKUS should not be used to treat a cutesymptoms. It is crucial to inform patient s ofthis and pre scribe a rapid onset, short duration beta 2-agonist for this purpose. The need for additional sy mptom atic bronchodil ator therapy is usually reduced with A ND P REC AUTIONS sectio n).Medical atte ntion should be sought if patients find that rapid onset, short duration relief bronchodilator treatment becomes l ess effective or if they need more inhalations than usual.Page 8of 49Bronchodilators should not be the only or th e maintreatment inpatients with moderate to severe or unstable asthma. P atients with severe asthma require regula r medical asses sment since death may occur. These patients will require high dose inh aled or oral corticosteroid therapy. S udden worsening of symptoms may re quire increased corticosteroid dosage which should be admi nistered under medical supervision. As twice -daily regular treatment, SEREVENT DISKUS provides 24 -hour br onch odilation and can replace regular use of a rapid onset, short duration (4 hour) inhaled or oral bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) w hen optimum corticosteroid therapy is bei ng used. For full therapeutic benefit, regular usage of SE REVE NTDISKUS is recomm ended in the treatment of reversible airway s obstruction. Chronic Obstructive Pulmo nary Diseas e (COPD ) Counselling on smoking cessation should be th e first step in tre ating patients with COPD. Smoking cessation produces symptomatic benefits and has bee n shown to conf er a survival advantage by slowing or stopp ing the progress ionof chronic bronchiti s and emphysema. Use with Rapid Onset, Short Durat ion Bronchodilators: When beginning treatme nt with SEREVENT DISKUS , COPD patients should be instructed to use their rapid onset, s hort duration bronc hodilators as de termined by their treati ng physician, at the lowest dose to relieve their symp toms. The regular t wice-daily administration of SEREVENT DISKUS should reduce the excessive use of rapid onset , short duratio n, inhaled bronc hodilators. General Consi derations for A and dosage or frequency of SEREVENT DISKUS admin istration should no t be increased since there may be serious adverse effects associated with excessive d osing. SERE VENTDISKUS should n ot be used more than twice daily. Elderly and patients with impaired renal or hepa tic function: There is no need to adjus t the dose in the otherwise healthy elderly or in patients with i mpaired renal f unction. Because salmeterol is p redominantl y cleared by hep atic metabolism, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. 4.2Recommended Dose and Dosage A djustme nt Asthma Maintenance T herapy Patients 4 years of age and older : One blister [50 micrograms of salmeterol (as the forg inhale a dose, instruct the patient to inhale anot her as soon as th ey remember unlessit is near the time for their next dose. If so the patient should wait until the next dose and resume theregular do sing sched ule. Do not do uble dose. 5OVERDOSA GE For management of a suspected drug overdose, contact your regional Poison Control Centre. Do Not Exceed Recommended Dosage: As with othe r inhaled beta 2-adrenergic drugs, SEREVENTDISKUS should not be us ed more often or at higher doses than recommended. Fatalities have been reported in associatio n with excessive use of inh aled sympathomimetic drugs. Large doses of inhaled or oral salmeterol (12 t o 20 times the recommended dose) ha ve been associat ed with c linicall y sign ificant prolongation of theQTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhy thmias (se e WARNINGS AND P REC AUTIONS , Card iovascular). The expected signs and s ymptoms of sa lmeterol overdosage are those typical of e xcessive beta2adrenergic stimulation including tremor, headache, tachycardia, increases in systolic blood pressure, cardiac arrhythmias, hyp okalemia, hypertension, or hypotension , metabolic a rare cases) and, in ext reme cases , sud den death. There is no specific treatment for an overdose of salmetero l. If over dose occurs, the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate mo nitoring as necessary. The judicious u se of a cardi oselective beta -recepto r blocker ma y be consi dered , bearing in m ind that such medication can produce br onchospasm. Fatalities have been reported following excessive use of aerosol pr eparations containing sympathomimetic amines, the e xact cause of which is unkn own. Car diac arres t was reported in several instances. 6DOSA GE FORMS, STRENGT HS, COMPOSITION A ND PA CKA GING Table 1 Route of A dministration, Dosage Forms /Strengths and Nonmedicinal Ingredients / powder fo r inhalation /50 mcg salmeterol/blisterLactose and milk protein SEREVENT DISKUS is a novel dr y powder presentation of microfine salmeterol (a sthe xinafoate salt) for inhalation.

The product consists of 60 doses, each containing the equivalent of 50 mcg of salmeterol per dose. 7WARNINGS A ND P REC AUTIONS Pleaseseethe Serious W arnings and Pre cautions B oxat the beginning of Part I: Health Professional Info rmation be initiated in patients with significantl yworse ning or acutely deteriorating asthma, w hich may be a life -threatening condition. Serious acute respiratory events, including fatalities, have been reported worldwide, when SEREVENT has been initiate d in this situation. Although it is not possible from these reports to determine whether SEREVENT contributed to these events or simply failed to relieve t he deteriorating asthma, the use of SEREVENT DISKUS in this setting is inappropriate. In most cases these re ports have oc curred in patients wi th severe as thma (e.g. , patients with a history of corticosteroid dependence, lowpulmonary fun ction, intubation, mechanical ventilation, frequent hospitalizations, or previous life -threatening acute asthma exacerbations) and/or in somepatients in whom as thma has bee n acutely deteriorating (e.g. , unresponsive to usual medications, increasing need f orinhaled rapid onset, short duration beta 2-agonists, increasing need for systemic cor ticosteroids, significant increase in sy mptoms, recen temergency room visits, sudden o r progress ive deterioration i n pulmonary function). However, they have occurred in a few patients with less severe asthma as well. There are no data demonstrating that SEREVENT DISKUS provides greater efficacy than or additional efficacy to rapid ons et, short duration, in haled beta 2-agonist s in patients with worsening asthm a. General SEREVE NTDISKUS is not a substitute for inhaled or oral corticosteroids All asthma patients should be advised that they must also use corticost eroids if t heyare taking SEREVE NTDISKUS .Corticosteroid therapy should not be stopped or re duce d when SEREVENT DISKUS is initiated. There are no data demonstrating that SEREVENT has a clinical anti -inflammatory effect and could be expe cted to take the place of, or reduce th e dose of, corticos teroids. A sthmatic patie nts mus t bewarned not to stop o r reduce corticosteroid therapy even if they feel better as a result of initiating SE REVENT DISKUS . Any change in corticosteroid dosage s ma de ONLY after cli nical evalua tion. In the treatment o f COPD, therole o f inhaled corticoste roid therapy is less well established and SEREVENT DISKUS could be used with or without con comitant corticosteroids. The use of oral or inhaled corticosteroids shoul d be determi ned by the treating physici an. SEREVENT DISKUS shou ld not be used to t reat acute asthma or COPD symptoms It is crucial to inform patients of this and pre scribe a rapid onset, short duration, inhaled bronchodilator to relieve ac ute symptoms . The use ofbronchod ilator s hould be dete rmined by the treating physician. The role of long -acting beta 2-agonists in the Management of A sthma and COPD The management of asthma should normally fo llow a stepwise programme, andpatient response should be m onitored clinically a nd by lung function tes ts. Sudden or progre ssive deterioration in asthma control is potentially life -threatening; treatment plan must be re - evaluated, and consideration be give n to increasing corticoste roidtherapy . In patie nts at risk , daily peak f low mon itoring with precise in structions for accep table variation limits should be Page 11of 49considered. Increased use of inhaled, rapid onset, short duration beta 2-agoni stsis a mark er of destabi lization of asthma and requires r e-evalua tion o f the p atient and consideratio n of alternative tre atment regimens, especially inhaled or systemic corticosteroids. Long -acting beta 2-agonists are an alternative additional therapy for pa tients with moderate a sthma w ith unsatisf actory sympto m co ntrol despite an op timal dose of inhale d steroids particularly when there are be p rovided to t he patient on how to use the drug a nd what to do if asthma flares up. Long -acting beta2-agonists are an additional therapy for COPD patients requir ing long -acting control of symptoms. Use with r apid onse t, short duration bronchodila tors When begin treatmen t with SEREVENT DISKUS , those who have been taking rapid onset, short duration, inhaled beta2-agonists on a reg ular daily basis should be advised to discontinue their regula rdaily-dosing regimen a nd should beclearly instruct ed to u se rapid onset, short duratio n, inhaled beta 2-agonists only for symptomatic relief if they develop asthma symptoms while taking SEREVE NTDISKUS . When onset, short duration bronch odilators as determi ned by their treating physician, at the lowest dose to relieve their symptoms. The re gular twice daily administration of SEREVENT DISKUS should reduce the e xcessive use of rapidonset, sh ort dura tioninhale d bronchodilators. Cardiovascular The pharmacological side-effects of beta2-agonist treatment, such as palpitations have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular ther apy(see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). A sma ll increase in QTc interval has been reported at therapeutic doses. Large doses of inhaled or oral salme terol (12 to 20 times the recommended dose) have been associated w ith clinically sig nificant pro longatio nof the Q Tc interval, which has the potential f or producing ventri cular arrhythmias. Fatalities have been reported following of aerosol preparations containing sympatho mimetic amine s, the exact cause of which is unknown .Cardiac arrest was reported in several instanc es. In a very large scale post -marketing surveillance study in the UK, involving over twenty -four thousand patients comparing safety o f salmeterol and salbutamol in the treatmen t of asthma, the o verall cardiovascul ar deaths on salmet erol treatment were 0.17% vs. 0.12% on salbutamol (p=0.308). The subdivision of these deaths into groups dependent on asthma severity was as follows:Page 12of 49Inves tigator A sses sment of Severity of Asthma Mild (%) Mode rate ( %) Severe (%) Salm eterol 0.04 0.11 0.55 Salbutamol 0.14 0.07 0.27 Test for interaction p=0.233 In individual patient s any beta 2-adrenergic agonist may have a clinically significant cardia c effect. Card iovasc ular effects such a s increased blood pressure and heart r ate may occasionally be seen with all sympathomimetic drugs, especially at higher tha n therapeutic doses. Occurrence of cardiovascular effects may requir e discontinu ation of the drug. Salmeter ol, like all sympa thomimetic amines, s hould be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coro nary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hyperte ors, clinically sign ificant changes in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and electroc ardiograms have been seen infrequently in individual patients in contro lledclinica l studies wit hsalmet erol. Central Nervous Sy stem Central nervous s ystem effects (e.g., agitation) can occur after the use of SEREVENT . Occurrence of central nervous syste m effects may require discontinuation of the drug. The pharmacolo gicalside-effects of beta2-agonist treatme nt, such as tremor and h eadache have been reported, but tend t o be transient and to reduce with regular therapy. Salmeterol, like all sympathomime tic amines, should be used with caution in patients w ith convulsiv edisordersor thyrotoxic osis; and in patients w to sympat homimetic amines. Ear/Nose/Throat Symptoms or swel ling, such as stridor and choking, have been reported rarely in pa tients receiving SEREVENT . Endocrine and M etabolism Similar other beta -adrenergic agents, salmeterol can induce reversible metabolic changes (e.g. hyperglycemia, hypokalemia). There have bee nvery rare report s of increa sesin blood glucose levels (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ,8.5Post-Market Advers eReaction s) and this should be considered when prescribing to patients w ith a history of d iabetes mellitus. Doses of the related b eta2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol, when administered intravenously, have been repo aggravate pre -existing diabetes and k etoacidosis. Administration of beta2-adrenoc eptor onists may cause a e in serum potassiu m, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to increase the likelihood of arrythm ias. The effect is usually seen at higher therapeutic doses and the decrease is usual ly transient, not req uiring Page 13of 49supplemen tation. Th erefore, salmeterol should be used with caution in patients predisposed to low levels of serum potassium. of urticaria, ang ioedema, rash, bronc hospasm and very rare cases of anaphylactic shock, or anaphylactic reaction. Monitor ing and Laboratory Tests Monitoring Control of Asthma Asthma may d eteriorate acutely over aperiod of hours o r chronically over several days or longer. If the patient's rapid onset, short duration inhaled beta 2-agonist becomes less e ffective or the patient needs more inhalation than usua l, this ma y bea ma destabi of imme diate re -evaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen. Increasing the daily dosage of SEREVENT DISKUS in this situation is not appropriate. SEREVENT DISKUS shoul d not be used morefrequently than twice daily(morning and e vening) at the rec ommended dose. Use in Adolescents/Chil dren and Asthma Severity Reassessment In adolescents and childr en, the severity of asthma may be variable with age a nd periodic reassessment should be consideredto determine if continu ed mainten ance therapy with SEREVENT DISKUS is still in dicated. Compliance, especially neglect of anti -inflammatory therapy and overuse of r apid onset, short duration beta 2-agonists, shou paradoxical bronchospasm, characterized by an immedia te increase in wheezing after dosing may occur with SEREVE NTDISKUS .This shou ldbe treat ed immediately with a rapid ons et, shor t duration inhaled bronchodil ator (e.g. salbutamo l) to relieve acute asthmatic symptoms. SEREVENT DISKUS should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed, and if neces sary, alternat ive therapy institute d (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Systemic Effects The results of a drug interaction study conducted in healthy subjects indicated that concomitant use of systemic ketoconazole (a strong cytochrome P450 3A4 in hibitor) increased exposure to salmete rol in so me s ubjects. This increas e in pla sma salmet erol exposure may l ead to prolongation in the QTc interval. Due to the potential increased risk of cardiov ascular adverse events, the concomi tant use of wi th ketocon azole not recommended (see9 DRUG INTERACTIONS ,Drug -Drug In teractions ).Caution should a lso be exercised when other CYP3A4 inh ibitors some effe ctson th e fetus, typ ical for a beta -agonist occurred at exposure levels substantially hig her than those t hat occur with therapeutic use. Extensive use of other beta-agonists has provided no evidence tha t effects in a nimals are relevant t o human use.Page 14of 49Thereare no adequ ate and in preg nant women. SERE VENT DISKUS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Use in Labour and De livery There are no well -control ledhuman studies that have investi gated effects of sa lmeterol on preterm labour or labour at term. Because of the potential for b eta-agonist interference with uterine contractility , use of SEREVENT DISKUS during labo ur should berestricted to tho se patients in whom thebenef its clearly outweigh the risks. 7.1.2 Breast -feeding Plasma levels of salmeterol after inhaled thera peutic doses are very low (85 to 200 pg/mL) in huma ns and therefore leve ls in mil k should be correspondingly lo w. Studies i n lactatinganima ls indicate that salm eterol is likely to be secreted in only very small amounts in breast milk. However, since there is no experience with use of SEREVEN Tby nursing mothers, a decision should be made whe therto discontinue nu rsing or to d isconti nue the dr ug, taking into acco unt the importance of the drug to t he mother. Caution should be exercised when salmeterol xinaf oate is administered to a nursing wom an. 7.1.3 Pediatrics Pediatrics ( < 4 year s of age ): The sa fety and effi cacy of SEREVENT in children younger than 4 years of ag e have not been established. Pediatrics ( 4-11 years of age ): The safety and efficacy of sa lmeterol in ch ildren 4 -11 years old with asthm a have been evaluated in con trolled clinic al trials for up to 1 year. 7.1.4 Geriatri cs No apparen t differences in the efficacy and safety of SEREVENT were o bserv ed when geriatric patients were compared with younger pati ents in a sthma and COPD cli nical trials. As with other beta2-agonists, however, special caution sh ould be observed wh en using SEREVEN TDISKUS in elderly patients who have concomitant cardiovascular d isease that could be adversely affect ed by this cla ss of drug. 8ADVERSE REACTIONS 8.1Adverse Rea ction Overview As with ot her inhalation therap y, the potential fo r paradoxica l bronchospasm should be kept in mind. If it occurs, the pre parati on should be discontinued immed iately and alt ernati ve therapy instituted. Adverse reactions to SER EVENT(salmeterol xinaf oate) are simi lar in nature to re actions to other selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists, i.e. palpitation ; immed There have of arthralgia and muscle cra mps.Page 15of and extrasystoles) have been reported, us ually in susceptibl e patients. Clinically significant changes in blood glucose and/or ser um pota ssium were seen rarely during clinical studi es with long -term adm inistration of SER EVENT at recommended doses. Asthma Long-acting beta 2-adrenergic agonists (LABA), including s almeterol, t he active ingredient in SEREVENT DISKUS , increase the risk of asthma -related de ath. Data from a la rge, 28 -week, placeb o-contr olled US study that compared salmeterol (SE REVENT Inhalation Aeroso l) orplacebo add ed to usual asthma therapy showed an increase in asthma -related death in patients receiving salmetero l. Post -hoc analysis of the SM ART trial data sugg ests th at the risks m ay be lower in pati ents who were using inhal ed cort icosteroids (ICS) at study entry. However, these post -hoc analysis results are not conclusive (see 14CLINICAL TRIALS : Salm eterol Multi -center Asthma Re search Trial (SMA RT)). Available data from contro lled c linical trialssuggest t hat LABA increase the ri sk of asthma - related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients (see WARNINGS AND PREC AUTIONS , and 14CLINICAL TRIALS : Salmeterol rch Trial (SMART) ). 8.2Clinical Trial A dverse Reactions Because clinical trials are conducted under very specific conditions ,theadver se reaction rates obse rved in the clinical trials ma y not reflect the rates ob served in practice and s hould not be compa red to the rates in the clinic al trials of another drug. Adverse reaction information from clinical trials is useful for identifyi ng drug-relate d adverse even ts and for approximating rates. Asthma Use in A dolesce nts andAdults(18 years of age and a bove ) In controlled, mult idose clinical trials (treatment period of up to 1 ye ar)involving almost 2000 patients (18 years old ), the most f requently occurrin g adverse events were headache, tremor and pal pitations ( see Table 2below), which are pharmacologically pre dictable effects of bet a2- adrenoceptor agonists. Tremor tended to be transi ent, dose -related and reduced w ith regular therapy. Headache and palpi tations were repor ted but the incidence was not significantly different from placebo.

These even ts have be en chosen for inclusion due to either their serious ness, frequenc y ofreporting, or causal c onnection to SEREVENT orADVAIRor a combination of these factors. Cardiac D isorders Very rare: Hypertension and arrhythmias ( including or anaphylac tic reaction . Metabolism and Nutritio n Disorder s Very rare : Hyperglycemia.

In extensive worldwide post -marke ting experience, serious exacerbations of asthma, including some that have been fatal, have been rep orted. In most cases, t hese hav e occurred in pati ents with seve re asthma and/or in some patients in whom asthma has be en acutel y deterior ating (see WARNINGS AND P REC AUTIONS ),but they have occurred i n a few patien ts with less severe asthm a as well.

However, a salm eterol-ketoconazole inter action stu dy resu lted i n a significant increase in p lasma salmeterol exposure (see WARNINGS AND P REC AUTIONS ). In a placebo -controlled, crossover d rug interaction study in 15 healthy s ubjects , co- administration of s almetero l (50 inhibitor, ketoconazole (400 mg o nce da ily orally), for 7 days, resulted in a significant increase in plasma sal meterol exposure (1.4 -fold C max and 1 5-fold AUC) .

Binding studiesin rats have sho wn evide nce of sl ow dissociat ion of the drug from its receptor site.The long duration of effe ct of salmet erolis due to a unique method of action whereby a portion of the molecule bind swith high affinit yto no n-polar domains or exosi tes from where th e rest of th e molecule can interact freely with the active site of the bet a2-adrenoceptor. Salmete rol offers more a longer duration of bronchod ilation, lasting for at least 1 2 hours, than recommended doses of conventional rapi d onset, short du ration beta2-agonis ts. In con trast to conventional rapid onset, short durat ion beta2-agonists, the on set ofthe bronchodilato r effect of salme terol usuall y occurs i n 10-20 minute s. However, the full benefits only bec ome apparent afte r the f irst or seco nd dose of t he drug. Regular improvement in lung func tionthereby reduci ng symp toms of airways obstruct ion. In vitro tests on human l ung,have shown salmeterol is a potent and long -lasting inhibi tor of the release of ma st cell mediators, su chas histamine, leukotrienes and prostaglandi nD2. In man, salmeterol in hibits t he early and late pha se respons e to inhaled a llergen. The late phase response is in hibited for over 30 hour s after a si ngle dose, w hen the bronchodilato r effect is no longer evident.

The mechanism i s different from the a nti-inflammato ry effect of corticosteroids. 10.2 Pharmacodynamics In patients, salm eterol by both p ressurised and powder inhalers in single doses of 25mcg or great er has been shown to produce br onchodil ation lasting for app roximately 12hours. Thi s long duration of action has been con firmed by challen ge stud ies using ex ercise, histamine and methacholin e as bronchoconstrictor agents. Salmeterol has also been shown to aboli sh boththe early and lat e phase bronchoconstri ctor re sponse to inhaled allerg en, the clinical significance of whichhas not been est ablishe d. Pharmaco logy Salm eterol is a potent , selective beta 2-agonist i n respiratory smooth musc le and onlung mast cells. Salmeter ol is virtua lly de void of be ta1-adrenocept or activity with only weak agonist act ivity at beta 3-adrenoceptor s.

Salmeterol caused a concentration -related inhibition histamine, ed human lu ue and was significantly more potent than salbutamol. Inhibiti on of mediator re lease indu ced by salbu tamol was of s hort duration of action (<2 hours) whereas significant activit y was observed with sa lmeterol after 20 hours. The pharm acodynamic s of salmetero lhas been investigated in healthy sub jects and in pati ents with reversible a irways obstruc tion. In healthy subjects, there were pharmacologically predic table extra -pulmonary effects on pulse only at d oses of 200 mcg a nd greater . The onset of bron action of salmeterol (10 -20 minutes ) isslower than that seen with salbutamol (5 -15 minu tes). Th ere was no evidenc e of tachy phylaxis in tha t dissoci ates in solution so that salmeterol an d 1- -2-naph thoic acid (x Salm eterol acts lo cally in thelung; plasma levels there fore do n otpredict therapeuti c effect.

The high plasma clearance of salmeterol indicates tha t chang es in the degree of prot ein bind ing are unlikely t o influence th erate of elimination. Metabolism: Salmeterol is pre hepatic me live rfunction impairme nt may lead to ac cumulation of salmeterol in plasma. Therefore, patients wit h hepati c diseas e should b e closely moni tored.An in vitro study showed that s almeterol approximately 25% and 60% of the dose was recovered in the urine and feces, resp ectively. Excretion was predominantly as metabolites with no xenobiotic, has been exten sively investi gated in both animal and h uman st udies.

This was a randomised, double blind, double - dummy, para llel group, 16 -week study. Randomisat ion was 2 salmeter ol patients: 1 s albutamol patient. Medical withdrawals due to asthma were statistically significant, fewer wi thsalmeterol than with salbutamol (2 .91% vs. 3.79%, p=0.0002). However there was a small increase in mortality in th e group taking salmete rol for obstructive airways disease deaths [16 (0.10%) in and 3 31of 49Forboth treatment groups the num ber of nonfatal adverse events was related to severity of asthma on entry. Salmeterol Multi-center A sthma Research Trial ( SMART) The SMART study was a lar ge US post -mark eting study that compa red the tion aerosol (salmeter ol 50 mcg twice daily) and placebo, added to the usual asthma therapy for a 28 -week treatment p eriod. This study was prematurely ter minated after a planned interim analysis in wh ich a safety issue was identified. This analysis was per formed on 26,355 patie nts, app roximately half of the intended number for enrollment in this trial. Analysis of the d ata available to date showed increase drisk for asthma -related death and other serious respiratory -relate d outcomes in pati ents treated wit h SEREVENT compared t o those treated with placebo, in addition to their usual asthma therapy. The risk for the primar y endpoint of combined respiratory -related death or life -threatenin g experience (i .e., intubation and/or mechanical ventil ation) which inc ludes the asthma -related outco mes, during the 28 -week treatment period, was 40% higher in patients using salmeterol in addition to their usual asthma thera py compared to those using pla cebo in additio n to their usual asthm a therapy (50 in 1 3,176 vs 36 in 1 3,179; <1% in both rela tive risk of 1.40 with 95% CI: 0.91, 2.14). When asthma - related death was analysed alone , a statistically significant increas ed risk of greater than four - fold was seen in patients who used sal meterol as compare d to those who u sed placebo in additio n to the ir usual asthma therapy (13 in 13,176 vs 3 in 13,179; <1% in both cases; relative risk o f 4.37 with 95% CI: 1.25, 15.34). In addition, statistically signif icant increased risks were observed f or the outcomes of combined asthma -related death or life -threate ning experience (37 vs 22; relative risk of 1.71 with 95% CI: 1.01, 2.89) and respirator y-related death (24 vs 11; relative r isk of 2.16 with 95% CI: 1.06, 4.41). These s tatistically significa nt increased risks were observed a t interim analysis whe n enroll ment was half the planned number, and the power relatively low. Post-hoc subgroup analyses suggest that the ri sk for these serious events ma y be greater in the African -American population. In thi s subgroup, the relative risks after t he 28 -week treatment period were: 4.10 for the primary endpoint (20 out of 2,366 5 out of 2,3 19; 95% CI: 1.54, 10.90) in patients using salmeterol in addition t o their usual a sthma therapy compared tothose using pl acebo in additio n to their usual asthm a therap y, 7.26 CI; 0.89, 58.94), 4.92 combined asthma -threatening ex perience (19 vs 4; CI: 1.6 8, CI: 0.83 , 18.26). The relative risks i n the Caucasian population were: 1.05 for the primary endpoint (29 out of 9,281 vs 28 ou t of 9,361; 95% CI: 0.62, 1.76) for p atients using salmeterol in ad dition to their usual asthma therapy compared to those adding placebo, 5.82 for asthma -relate d death (6 vs 1; 95% CI: 0.70, 48.37), 1.08 for combined asthma -related death or life -threatenin g experience (17 vs 16; CI: 0.55, 2.14), vs 7; 95% CI: While no t conclusive, a post -hoc analy ses, of the data from the SMART trial suggested that the use of inhaled corticosteroids asreported at study entry, had a pro tective effect regarding asthm a-related outco mes in patients taking SEREVENT . For th e primary endpoi nt of combined respira tory-related death or life -threatening experience, a relative risk of 1.60 (27 out of 7,049 vs 17out of 7,041; 95% inhale d corticosteroid use a t study entry, whi le a relative ri sk of 1.21 (23 out of 6,127 vs 19 out of 6,138; 95% CI: 0.66, 2.23) was observed for those who did report ICS use. For asthma -related death alone, the relat ive risks were: 18.98* (9 vs 0; with 95% CI: 1.10, 326.15) for tho se without baselin e ICS use, and 1 .35 (4 vs 3; 95% CI: 0 .30, 6.0 4) for those reporting ICS use. For asthma -related death or life -threatening experience, the relative risks were: (21 vs 9; 95% Page 32of 49CI: 1.10, 5.22) for th ose without bas eline ICS use, and 1.2 4 (16 vs 13; 95% C I; 0.60, 2.58) f or those reporting ICS use; an d, for respiratory -related death: 2.28 (14 vs 6; 95% CI; 0.88, 5.94) for those without ba seline and 2.00 (10 vs 5; 95 %CI: 0.69, 5.86) for those r eporting ICS us e. Hence, the apparent protective effect was most notabl e for asthma -related o utcomes. When ICS effect was further analysed by ethnicity, risks of asthma -related outcomes were diminished for the African -American subgroup with ICS use (as rep orted at study entry), but contrary t o the Caucasian su bgroup, these ri sks were not extinguis hed, alt hough the data for this analysis were sparse. It is to be noted that the SMART study data do not include information regarding the continued use of ICS aft er study entry, nor information regar ding the dose(s) o f ICS used throu ghout the treatment pe riod of 28 weeks. A number of limitations are noted in the clinical trial's design and conduct, such as the ascertainme nt and enumeration of events, collection of covariate information (i.e., continued concurrent ICS us e) and confounding fac tors, wh ich may make the interpretation of the results problematic. In addition, post -hoc subgrou p analyses may be unstable and/or eas ily influenced by small chang es in covariate s or additional events . The findings from SMART are similar to the Salm eterol Nationwide Surveillance study conducted in the UK, where increased asthma -related deaths were observed for patients treated with salmeterol as compa red to salbutam ol over a 16 -week peri od. Given the simil ar basic mechanisms of action of 2-agonists, it is possible that the findings seen in this study may be consistent wit h a class effect. *Estimated by adding .5 to each c ell of the trea tment by event occurre nce table.

In pa tients u sing SEREVENT a significantly greater perce ntage of patients showed improvement in global quality of life scores (46%) as compared to p atients receiving placebo (32%). 16NON -CLIN ICAL TOXICO LOG Y Safety Pharmacol ogy The effects of salmeterol (as either the base or the xinafoate salt) on behaviour, muscl e tone, reflexes and autonomic function were investigated following intravenous dosing in the dog and acute or aladministrat ion in cons cious rat an ddog. These effects were consistent with the known pharmacology of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists. Salmeterol b ase (0.1 -1.0mg/kg i.v.) in the dog caused marked tachycardia. At 0.3 mg/kg, there was slight vasodilation and vomiting. Animals receiv ing 1 mg/kg showed signs of subdued behaviour. S almeterol (25 -100mg/kg p.o.) reduced general activity in the rat. In the dog, oral salmeterol (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) induced persistent tachycardia and cutaneous vasodilation, with some lacrimation o ccurring at 3 and 10mg/kg. Salmeterol caused no overt effe cts on gastrointestinal function following oral administration, producing no emetic or defaecatory effects in dogs over the dose range 1 - 10mg/kg and no effects on defaecatory activit y in rats at d oses of 25 -100mg/kg. However, emesis was observed in the dog following intravenous doses of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg. In conscious cynomolgus monkey, oral salmeterol (1 and 10 mg/kg) had only minor cardiov ascular effect s,causing small increa ses in heart rate which were not cle arly dose - related. There was no evidence of dysrhythmia or of significant changes in the electrocardiogram at either dose level. Salmeterol did not affect pento barbitone-induced sleepin g time in mi ce suggesting it is unlikely to inte rfere with hepatic drug metabolism. Acute Toxicity Extremely high levels of salmeterol xinafoate, relative to the therapeutic do se, were tolerated irrespective ofthe route o f administr ation or spe cies employed. At the maximum achievable or maximum non -letha l dosages, clinical signs were generally non -specific or were expected consequences of the pharmacological activity of salmete rol (e.g. vasodilation and tachy cardia in dogs ). There we re no findin gs indicative of specific target organ toxicity and salmetero l was well tolerated in the respiratory tract.Page 37of 49Table 12 Species comparison of single dose toxicity studies conducted with salmeterol xinafoate Species (route ) Approx. LD50 (mg/kg)Maximu m Non - Lethal Dose [MNLD] (mg/kg)MNLD as a Multiple of Therapeutic Dose Mouse (oral) 150 >75,000 Long-term Toxicity Subac ute toxicity studies of up to 13 weeks in rats , at doses up to 0.7mg/kg/day by inhalation and/or 2.0 mg/kg/day orally were conducted. No significant treatment -induced chang eswere seen. Findings included reduc tions in the number of platelets, decreased pl asma glucose, increased urea and creatinine, i ncreased urine v olume associated with decreased specific gravity, increased heart and lung weights, and decreased liver and kid ney weights. These regressed followin ga 4-week recovery period and were considered to be a consequence of the pharmacological ac tivityof salmet erol. Slight concentration were considere d to reflect metabolic adaptation by the liver to high circulating concentrations of salmeterol and regressed fully during the recovery period. In dog studies up to 13 weeks, reductions in mean cell volume and mean cell hemoglobin, a nd increases in anisocytosis and hypo chromia were found to occur at doses greater than 0.05 mg/kg/day orally and 0.07 mg/kg/day by inhalation. In two female dogs treated at these dosag es, histological changes were observed in the papillary muscle of the he art in common with known effects of o ther adrenoceptor agonists. Chronic toxicity studies were carried o ut forup to 18 mo nths in rats and up to 12 months in dogs. Repeated high exposures to salmeterol xinafoate were tolerated well b y rats and do gs, both locally within the respiratory tract, and systemically. Min or laryngeal changes occurred only after prolo nged exposure to h igh inhaled doses ( 0.18 mg/kg/day) and were confined to the rat, a species known to be especially sensitive. O ther findings were a consequence of e xcessive pharmacological activity or expecte d metabolic adjustments in response to high ci rculating plasma l evels of salmeterol. No effects attribu table to hydroxynaphthoic acid were observed in any study. A slight, work -induced incr ease in heart weight was fo und to occur in rats treated with inhaled salmeterol xinafoate. Cardiovascular ef fects in dogs dosed orally at 0.1 -10.0 mg/kg/day included slight to marked transient reflex tachycardia as a co nsequence of peripheral vasodilation and occasional areas of foc al papillary muscle necrosis as a consequence of tac hycardia. Skeletal muscle hypertrophy was evi dent in rats and dogs treated orally or by inhalation. In rats, the effe ctdiminished with extended treatment and reversed over 18 month s. Small increases in plasma urea and creatinine in some rat an d dog studies were concluded to be associated with skelet al muscle hypertrophy; no renal pathology was detected.Page 38of 49Minor fluctuations in serum en zyme activity levels occurr ed in some rat studies without significant histopath ological ch ange s and were att ributed to slight metabolic adjustments by the liver to high circulating salmeterol levels. Mild, transient red uctions in so me erythrocyte measureme nts occurred in some dogs t reated orally at doses of 1 mg/kg/day or more of salmeterol. Th e effects regresse d despite continued treatment. Themaximum concentrations of salmeterol detected in plas repeat -dose, combi ned oral/inhalation toxici ty studies exceeds by -fold the maxim um concentr ation s(200 pg/mL) determined after the standard therapeut ic dose in humans. The species used in toxicological studies were subjec ted to a syst emic exposure of salmete rol of up to 1800 -fold gre ater than that resulting from the therapeutic dosage in humans. Carcinogenicity In an 18 -month or al carcinogenicity study in CD -mice, salmeterol xinafoate caused a dose - related increa se in the incidence of s mooth muscle hyperplasia, cystic glandular hyperplasia, and leiomyomas of the uterus and a dose-related incr ease in the incidence of cysts in the ovaries. A higher incidence of leiomyosarcomas was not statistically sign ificant; tumo r findings were observed at oral doses of 1.4 and 10mg/kg, which gave 9 and 63 times, respectively, the human e xposu re based on rod ent:human AUC comparisons. Salmeterol caused a dose -related increase in the incidence of mesovarian l eiomyomas and ovarian cy sts in Sprague Dawley rat s in a 24 -month inhalation/oral carcinogenicity stud y. Tumors w ere o bserved in rats receiving doses of 0.68 and 2.58 mg/k g per day (about 55 and 215 times the recommended clinical dose [mg/m2]).These findin gs in rodents are simila rto those reported previ ously for other beta -adrenergic agonist drugs. The r elevance of these findings to h uman use is unknown. No significant effects occurred in mice at 0.2 mg/kg (1.3 times the recommended clinical dose based on c omparisons of the AUCs) a nd in rats at 0.21 mg/kg (15 times the recommended clinical dos e on amg/m2basis). Mutagenicity Salmeterol xinafoate produced no detectable or reproducible increases in m icrobial and mammalian gene mutation in vitro. No blastogenic activity occurred in vitro in human lymphocytes or in vivo in arat micronucleus te st. No effects on fertility were ident ified in male and female rats treated orally with salmeterol xinafoate at doses up to 2mg/kg orally (about 16 0 times the recommended c linical dose on a mg/m2basis). Reproduction and Te ratology No significant effects of maternal exp osure to oral salmeterol xinafoate occurred in the rat at doses up to the equivalent o f about 160 times the re commended clinical dose o n a mg/m2basis. Dutch rabbit fetuses exposed to sal meterol xin afoatein utero exhibited effects characteristically resul ting from beta -adrenoceptor stimulation; these included precocious eyelid openings, cl eft palate, sternebral f usion, limb and paw flexu res, and delayed ossification of the frontal cranial bones. No significant effects occurred at 0.6 mg/kg given orally (12 times the recommended clinical dose based on comparison of the AUCs). New Zealand W hiterabbits were less sensi tive since only delayed ossification of the frontal bones was s een a t10mg/kg given orally (approximately 1,600 times the recommended clinical Page 39of 49dose on a mg/m2basis). Extensive use of other beta -agonists has provided no evidence th at these class effects in animals are relevant to use in humans. Irritancy and Local To leran ce In an eye irritation study, 4 puffs (100 mg/puff) of salmeterol aerosol suspension were administered tothe right eyes of female New Zeala nd White rabbits. The lef t eyes served as controls. No signs of iritis or irr itant react ion o fthe cornea we re seen over the 24 -hour period follow ing the administration of salmeterol xinafoate 49READ THIS xinafoate dry pow der for inhalation Read t his carefully before y ou start ta king SEREVENT DISK USand each time you get a refill. This leaflet is a summary and will not tell you everything abo ut this drug . Talk to your healthcare professional about your medical conditio n and treatment and ask if the re is any new informat ion about SEREVE NT DISKUS . What is SEREVENT DISK USused for ? Asthma (patients 4 y ears old and older): SEREVENT DISKUS helps to prevent breathlessness a ndwheezing from happening due to asthma. SEREVENT DISKUS is used only as an add -on therapy to an inhaled corticosteroid when an inhaled corticos teroid by itself is not adequ ate to control your asthma symptoms. Asthma is a chronic in flammatory disease of the lungs chara cterized by episodes of difficulty in breathing. People with asthma have extra sensitive or \"twitchy\" airway s. Du ring an asth ma attack, the a irways react by narrowing making it more difficult fo r the air to flow in and out of the lungs. Control of asthma requires avoiding irritants that cause asthma atta cks and taking the appropriate medi catio ns. For exam ple, patien ts sh ould avoid exposure to house dust mites, mold, pets, tobacco smoke and pollens . Note to Parents :It is extremely i mportant to make sure that children 4 to 18 years take both SEREVENT DISKUS andan inhaled corticosteroid together. If this cannot be guaranteed , speak to your doctor. A single combination product, containing both a bro nchodilator and an inhaled corticoste roid, may be required. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): SEREVENT DISKUS isused for the long -term control of symptoms due to COPD and to prevent wheezin g in adults with COPD.Serious Warnings and Precautions SERIOU S WARNINGS FO R ASTHMA PATIENTS TAKING SEREVENT DISKUS SEREVENT DISKUS increases the risk of asthma -related dea th. SEREVENT DISKUS may increase t he risk of asthm a-related h ospit alizations in patients 4 to 18 years old. Therefore, SERE VENTDISKUS : must only be used as an add-ontherapy when your inhaled corticosteroid does not adequately co ntrol your asthma symptoms. must be us ed together wi th an inhal ed co rticosteroid. may be discontinued by your doctor when your asthma is assessed as adequately under control. For any co ncerns regarding the use of SEREVENT DISKUS , consult with your docto r.Page 41of 49COPD i s a type of lung disease in which the re is a permanent narrowing of the airways, leading to breathing difficulties. In many patient s, this narr owing of the airw ays is a result of many years of cigarette smoking. If you suffer from COPD, you must stop smoki ngto prevent further lung damage. Pl ease contact your healthcare professional for help in smoking cessation. How does SEREVENT DISK USwork? SEREV ENT DISKUS is a bronchodilator. It works by reli eving spasm o r narrowing in the small airpassages in the lungs. This h elps to open up the airwa ys and makes it easier for a ir to get in and out of the lungs. The effects of SEREVENT DISKUS last for at le ast 12 hours. When it is taken regular ly for the tre atment of C OPD o rin combination with a n inhaled corticosteroid for the trea tment of asthma, it helps the small air passages to stay open. SEREVENT DISKUS does not act quickly enough t o provide relief from a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing due to asthma or COP D.A fast acting 'reliever' medicine, such as salbutamol (e.g., VENTOLIN ) should be used for any sudden attacks of breathlessness or wheezing ( e.g., asthma attacks). Remember: If you are bei ng treated for asthma, you should always be given an inhaled cort icosteroid for use together with SERE VENT DISKUS . The inhaled corticosteroid decreases the inflammation in your lungs while SEREVENT DISKUS opensthe airways. What are the Medicinal ingredien ts:salmeterol xinafoate. Non-medicinal ilk sugar) and milk protein. SEREVENT DISKUS comes in the following dosage forms: SEREVEN TDISKUS is a dry powder administered through a plastic inhaler device containi ng a foil strip with 60 blisters. Each blister conta ins 50 mcg of sa lmeterol. Do not use SEREVENT DISKUS : Without an inhaled corticosteroid if you are being treated for asthma If you are allergic or have had an allergic reaction (swelling, anaphylactic reaction) to salmeterol or any of t heingredients in SEREVENT DISKUS Ifyou have a past history of problems with the way your heart beats called cardiac tachyarrhythmias (heart beating fast and/or irregularly) If you are allergic to lactose (milk sugar) or milk protein To help avo id side effects and ensure pro per use, talk to your healthcare profes sional before y ou take SEREVENT DISKUS . Talk about any health co nditions or probl ems you may have , including if you: Had to stop taking another medication for yo ur breathi ngproblems because you were allergic to it or it cau sed p roblems. Have been told that you are allergic to lact ose (milk sugar ) or milk protein . Are receiving treatment for a thyroid condition. Have diabetes. Have raised blood pressure. Have a h eart probl em. Are pregnant, plan ning to become pregnant or bre astfe eding. Are taking a medicine called ketoconazole, use d to treat fung al infection.Page 42of 49Have a past history of seizures. Other warnings y ou should kno w about: SERE VENT DISKUS is not for the treatment of a cute asth ma at tacks or su dden increase of breathlessness and wheezing in COPD. If you get a sudden atta ck of wheezing an d breathlessness between your doses of SEREVENT DISKUS and inhaled corticosteroid, you shou ld use your actin g 'reliever' medicine, such as salbut amol(e.g.VENTOLIN ) which your doctor has prescribed to you. Use the medication as direc ted by your docto r. Diabetes: SEREVENT DISKUS can increase your blood sugar levels. Diabetic patients may need the ir blood sugar monitored more o ften. I f you notice c hanges, dis cuss this with your doctor. Your diabetes medication may n eed a dosage adjustment. Blood Tests: SEREVENT DISKUS can cause abnormal blood test results including i ncreased blood sugar. Your healthcare professi onalwill decide when to perform bloo dtests and will interpret the results . Asthma: You should have your asthma assessed at regular intervals as agreed upon with your doctor. Once contr ol of your asthma is achieved a nd maintained, your d octor may d iscon tinue DISKUS. Do not sto ptaking your SEREVENT DISKUS unless your doc tor has advised you to do so. If you n otice the follo wing warning signs, y ou should contact your healthcare professional aspossible or go to the near esthospital: A sudden worsening of your shortness of breath and wheez ing shortly after using y our fast acting 'reliever' medicine or after using SEREVENT DISKUS and inhaled corticosteroid . You do no t feel reli ef within 10 minutes after using y our fa st acting 'relieve r' medicine or the relief does not l ast for at least 3 hours. Meas urement from y our peak flo w meter indicates a v alue less than 60 percent of predicte d or personal b est. You are br eathless at re st. Your pulse is more than 120 beats per minute. The followi ngwarning signs indicate that your asthma cond ition may be worsening and that your treatment needs to be reas sessedby your doctor. A change in y our symptoms such as more coughing, attacks of wheezing, chest tightness, or an unusual increase in the severity of the breathlessness. You wake up at night with che st tightnes s, wheezing or shortness o fbreath. You use increasing amounts of your f ast acting 'reliever' medicine. Measurement from your peak flow meter indicat es a value between 60 and 80 percent of predicted or personal b est. COPD: If you have COPD, it is very important that even mild chest infections be treated right away. If you think you h ave an infection, see your doctor immediately.Page 43of 49People with CO PD are more lik ely to get theflu (influenza). You s hould ask your doctor about flu vaccination. The following warning signs indicate that your COPD condition may be worsening. You should contact your doctor as soon as possible if yo u notice: An unusual increase or decrea se in the amount of phl egm. An unusua l increase in the consistency and stickiness of the phlegm. The presence of b lood in phlegm. Achange in th e colour of the phlegm to either brow n, yellow or green. An unusual increase in the severity of the breathlessness. The necessity to increase the number of pill ows in order to sleep in comfort. Symptoms of a cold (e.g., sor e throat). Unexplained tir edness or fever. Chest tightness . Unexplained swelling. Tell your healthcare professional about all the medicines y ou take, including any drugs , vitamins, minerals, natural supplements or alternative med icines. The f ollowing ma y interact with SEREVENT DI SKUS: Medicinesused to treat fungal infections, such as ketoconazole Medicines used to treat high blood pressure, such asdiuretics, also called \"water pills\" Medicines used to treat heart problems, such as beta -blockers Medicines u sed to treat depression ,such as mono amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or tricyclic antidepressants Other medicines to treat asthma and COPD How to take SEREVENT DISK US: It isvery important that you use SEREVENT DISKUS twice a d ay, even if you have no symptoms. Use it once in the morning and again in the evening. When used for the treatment of COPD or together wi th an inhaled corticosteroid for the tre atment of as thma, SEREV ENT DISKUS will help protect you against breakthrough sy mptoms throughout the d ay and during the night. You should not use it more than twice a day . SEREVENT DISKUS does not replace your fa st acting 'reliever' medicine, such as salbu tamol (e .g. VENTOLI corticosteroid therapy such propionate (e.g., FLOVENT ).The over use of SEREVENT DISKUS can cause serious side effects. After you h ave sta rted taking SE REVENT DISKUS it is likely that yo u will not ne ed to use the fast acting 'reliever' medicine as often. If you hav e more than one medicin ebe careful not to confuse them. If your doctor decides to stop treatment, do not keep any left -over m edicine unless y our doctor tells you to. Usual A sthma Dose: The usual dose is 1 inh alation twice daily (1 inhala tion in the morning and 1 inhalation in the evening). Even if you feel much better after st arting to use SEREVENT DISKUS , you must conti nue t o use an inhaled corticosteroid for your asthma accor ding to yo urdoctor's instruction s.Page 44of 49Adolescent s/Children with A 18 y ears of age): SEREVENT DISKUS is suitable for child ren 4 years of age and older. Th e severity of asthma changes with age. Your child should therefore be periodicall y re-examined by a doct or. It is impo rtant to make sure that he/she understands and properly follows the asthma therapies that have been prescr ibed. These will include in addi tion to SER EVENT DISKUS , a drug which reduces the inflammation in t he lung due to asthma (also known as an inhaled cor ticosteroid or 'controller' medication) and a rapid onset, short duration bronchodil ator (also known as a fast acting 'reliever' medicin e). It is extre mely important to make sure that children 4 to 18 yea rs take both S EREVENT DISKUS andaninhaled cortico steroid together. If this cannot be guaranteed , speak to your doctor. A single com bination product, contai ning both a bronchodilator a nd an inhal ed corticosteroid, may be required. Usual COPD Dose: The usual do se is 1 inhalation twice daily (1 inhalation in the morning and 1 inhalation in th e evening). COPD: If you are troubl ed wi th mu cus, try to clear your chest as completely as possibl e by coughing before you use SEREVENT DISKUS . This wi ll allow SEREVENT DISKUS to pass more deeply into your lungs. Even if you feel much better after starting t o use SERE VENT DISKUS , you must continue to use your other COPD med ication(s) according t o your doctor's instruc tions. About your SEREVENT DISKUS : The blisters protect the powde r for inhal ation from the effect s of the atmosphere. When you take your SEREVENT DISKUS out of its box, it will be in th e closed po sition . A new DISKUS contains 60 individually protected doses of your medi cine, in powde r form. The device h asa dose counter which tell s you the number of doses remaining. It counts down from 60 to 1. To show when the last five doses have be en reached the numbers appear red. Each dose is accurately mea sured and hygi enically protected. Itrequires no ma intenance, use y our SEREVENT DISKUS prope rly: It is important that you take each dose as inst ructed by your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. The DISKUS is easy to use. When you need a dose, just follow the six simpl e steps illust rated: 1. Open, 2. Slide, 3. Exhale, 4. Inhale, 5. Close, 6. Rinse. Sliding the lever of your DISKU Sopens a smal lhole in the mouthpiece and unwraps a dose ready for you to inhale it. When you clos e the DISKUS , the lev erautomatic ally moves back to itsoriginal position ready for your next dose whe n you need it. The outer case pr otects y our DISKUS when it is not in use.Page 45of 49 1.Open To open your DISKUS hold the outer case in one hand and put the thumb of your other hand on th e thumb gr ip. Push th e thu mb grip away from you, until you hear it click into p lace. 2.Slide Hold your DISKUS with the mouthpiece to wards you. Sli de the lever away until you hear another click. Your DISKUS isnow ready to use. Every time the lever is pushed back a dose is made availa ble for inhaling. This is shown by the dose counter. Do not play with the lever as this releases doses which will be wasted. 3.Exhale Hold the DISKUS away from your mouth. Bre ath out as far as is com fortable. Remember -never e xhale into your DISKUS . 4.Inhale Before you start to inhale the do se, read through this section carefull y. Once you have fully exhaled, place the mouthpiece to your mouth and close your lips around it. Breathe in steadily and deeply through your m outh until a full breath is taken. Remove the DISKUS from your mouth. Hold your breath for about 10 seconds or as long as is comfortabl e. Breathe out slowly. You may not be able to taste or feel the po wder on your tongue, even if youhave used the D ISKUS correctly . 5.Clos e To close you r DISKUS , put your thumb in the thumb grip, and slide it back until you hear a click.The lever is now automatically reset for your next use. The counter on the DISKUS indicates how many doses are rema ining. 6.Rinse Rinseout your m outh and gargle with w ater after each dose. Do not swallow the water. Overdose: Ifyou think you have taken too much SEREVENT DISK US, contact your healthcare professional , hospital emergency department or regional poison control centre immediately, even if there are no symptoms. If you accidentall y take a larger dose than r ecomme nded , you may not ice that your heartis beating faster than usual and that you feel shaky. Other symptoms you may ex perience include head ache, muscle weakness and aching j oints. Tell your doctor as soon as possible or conta ct your hos pital emergency department. Excessive use of SEREVE NTDISKUS can be extremely dangerous. If you have used a larger Page 46of 49than allowed recommen ded dose of SEREVENT DISKUS for a long period of ti me (months or years), you should talk to your doctor or pharmac ist for advice. A gr adual reduction of your dose may be n eeded. Do not stop taking the medication suddenly. Missed Dose: It is very important that you use SEREVEN TDISKUS regularly .If you forget to inhale a dose do not worry, inha le an other as soon as you remember butif it is near to th etime for the next dose, wait until this is due. Do not take a double dose. Then go o n as before. What ar e possible side effects from using SEREVENT DISK US?
