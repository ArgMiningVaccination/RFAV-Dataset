Self-medication with herbal supplements which are promoted for general well-being, weight loss, immunity, and memory boost, and mental and physical health claims are very prevalent. There is a misperception that herbal supplements are harmless as they are prepared from natural sources. Unlike conventional drugs, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate herbal supplements for premarketing purity and potency. Hence, there is a growing concern for health risks due to misbranded toxic ingredients, contaminants, adulterants, and herb-drug interactions (HDI) with co-administered drugs. The spectrum of pharmacological and toxicological effects of herbal supplements includes deranged lab results, allergic reactions, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, organ damage, and even fatality contributing to sizable emergency visits and hospitalizations in the US. The use of herbal supplements should be carefully monitored in high-risk groups such as pediatric and geriatric populations, pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, immunocompromised patients, and surgical candidates. The deleterious health effects of herbal supplements are loosely addressed in conventional medical practice in part due to the limited knowledge of practitioners. This comprehensive narrative review aims to explore the clinical implications of herbal supplements in order to fill the knowledge gaps by summarizing scientific publications. It also highlights the pivotal roles physicians can play in minimizing the health risks of herbal supplements by encouraging patients to disclose usage through a non-judgmental approach, employing HDI screening tools, and reporting adverse reactions to FDA. Formal training of physicians, a standardized pharmacovigilance system, stricter regulation of the herbal industry, and more scientific studies are keys to establishing herbal safety and efficacy in clinical practice.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-07-15", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
