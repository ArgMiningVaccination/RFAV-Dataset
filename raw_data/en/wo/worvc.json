Curious about whether there are crystals or stones I do not work with? You're not alone! Many of my clients grapple with similar questions, so to help you out faster, I have compiled the most frequently asked questions in one place. Here you go! HOW DO CRYSTALS WORK? Everything in the universe has a vibrational frequency, and as living organisms made up of several separate parts, we are susceptible to stagnant, sluggish or sporadic energy. Unlike us, crystals have the unique atomic structure that not only prevents them from having unstable energy, it also allows them to oscillate, or move outside energy in a smooth flow. The goal of crystal healing is to balance the energy centers of the body by stabilizing their vibrational frequency when placed on or around the body. IS CRYSTAL HEALING A \"NEW AGE\" THING? No. Crystal healing has been around since pre-recorded history as the art of \"laying on of stones' ' or Lithotherapy. This practice has been recorded for thousands of years in ancient Egypt, Mesoamerica, Native North America, South America, China, India, among Australian Aborigines, and many more cultures. Crystals are even referenced over 200 times in the Bible. Crystals and stones were used for a variety of reasons including identification, physical, mental, emotional and spiritual healing. WHAT GIVES INDIVIDUAL STONES THEIR HEALING CHARACTERISTICS? Different stones have different energetic properties. There are tons of books that list crystals by mental, physical, emotional and spiritual uses; these are based on experience and interpretations of the energy each crystal carries. The information can be a guiding post, but what works for one is not always what will work or is best for another. WHY ARE THERE DIFFERENT CRYSTALS RECOMMENDED FOR THE SAME THING? With approximately 6 THOUSAND crystals and stones, and thousands of years of use, there have been a lot of different experiences and opinions as to what crystal or stone does what. The crystals used and a crystal's specific use vary by region and culture. Just like most things in the natural world, crystals and stones are native to certain areas of the world, so what one region used may not have been available in another region, so different crystals were used for the same purpose. HOW DO YOU KNOW WHICH ONE TO PICK? Most people start with books or the internet, but what works for one person may not necessarily work for or be the best option for someone else. You do not need to know the exact properties of every stone before selecting them, and you may set out to buy a particular stone but find yourself drawn to another instead. Don't stress, this is your high-self at work, the best way to choose a crystal is using your intuition and some crystals basics including color, shape, size, composition and origin. ARE THERE ANY STONES AND CRYSTALS DO YOU NOT WORK WITH? I do not work with fake, artificial or man-made \"crystals\" as they do not have the perfect atomic structure that gives crystals their unique healing properties. I'll pass on the plastic, glass and lab created, thank you! ARE THERE ANY SIDE-EFFECTS OR DANGERS FROM CRYSTAL HEALING? Physically, crystals and stones are products of nature and may have a toxic chemical composition. It is important to make certain that you are using crystals that are nontoxic or appropriately using those with toxic elements in them. This is where a trained crystal healer comes in, but unfortunately not all crystal healers are trained equally. It is important to thoroughly research and understand a crystal healer's education and knowledge base before working with them. When done correctly, you are likely to experience a deep state of relaxation and overall sense of peace and calm during a healing session as the brain enters Theta Waves. HOW OFTEN SHOULD I HAVE A HEALING SESSION? This is a personal choice, as well as determined by your unique energetic needs. Some clients come weekly, while most others are monthly, quarterly, or on astrologically and energetically significant dates. My goal is to get you into alignment and then you self-maintain while using periodic sessions as a means to further raise your vibrational frequency rather than correct imbalances. What you do everyday is more important than what you do every once in a while. Regular sessions have immense benefits, but how frequently that regularity is depends on you and what you have going on physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. "}
