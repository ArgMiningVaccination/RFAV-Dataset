Yes, It Kind Of Does, Sometimes, But It Depends And Sometimes You Don't Feel Anything. (BUT Feeling Something Is Good Though!) If you pinched me I'd probably say \"OW! That hurt!\" but soon after I'd be OK. When you get acupuncture, you WILL FEEL something - a tiny pinch, a prick, a sting which lasts a few seconds at most. I would rate this no more than 2/10 on a pain scale. There can be discomfort but the sensations from acupuncture will change after the initial prick and at times, throughout the treatment. Some of the common sensations are: itchiness, heat or warmth, tightening, a dull ache, a muscle twitch, electrical sensation down a body part or static-y feeling. It is normal to feel these things. I always try to emphasize with my community that FEELING is quite important. We live in a world where our tendency is to numb our emotions and what we feel in order to be more efficient or effective, but we get used to this and ultimately forget how to read our own internal sensations. This is where we run into trouble because we become less in touch with our own bodies. I have found that new patients tend to feel concerned that acupuncture will hurt or they have some fear of laying still with needles in them. Both very valid concerns to someone who is new to this. To give this a bit of more perspective I asked a few people to describe their experiences with acupuncture. \"It's a quick poke, and to me, it feels like a massage.\" \"The moment the needle makes contact with my ear, I feel an instant sense of calmness,\" says Ann, mom and yoga instructor in Brooklyn, NY. \"It's a quick poke, and to me, it feels like a massage. I've only done acupuncture twice and those two moments were amazing!\" Abigail B., a blogger in the Bay Area says, \"For the most part, I barely even feel the needles go in. When I do, it's just the slightest little pinch. As far as how it feels once the needles are in, I again don't feel them usually. On the rare occasions that I do, it can feel a little tight in the area, if that makes sense. However, that usually doesn't last long. Maybe once or twice, I've felt a little tinge like when your funny bone gets hit, but I'll ask my acupuncturist to adjust it, and it feels totally fine afterwards. Never have I felt any pain during any of my treatments.\" These are Abigail's experiences with Rachel Hemphill in Oakland and with Dr. Andrea Jang in San Francisco. \"I've had sensations that feels like a string of energy is flowing from one point of my body to the next.\" I love this description that writer, A.A. who was receiving acupuncture at Minka in Brooklyn, gave: \"Acupuncture has different sensations, depending on what part of my body needs to be worked on that day and whether I'm feeling unwell. If the needle is inserted in a sore spot, it feels sharp and prominent. If it's inserted in an area that is connected to another spot that needs work, I feel a light pinch and no discomfort. I've had sensations that feels like a string of energy is flowing from one point of my body to the next. I've often felt like the part where the needle is inserted is awakening - becoming aware of the healing that needs to be done. After all the needles are inserted in their rightful places, and I'm left to rest and heal, I enter a meditative, dream like space where my mind can openly fantasize while my body and spirit work together to heal.\" \"Sometimes it feels like a heavy, warm hand during the treatment. \" Medical doctor, Macy says about her treatments with Michael Lee in Vancouver, WA: \"The needles going in are like really tiny pricks that's lasts maybe a millisecond. Most of the time, I don't even feel it. To me, it adds warmth to the area (especially with the lamp on). Sometimes it feels like a heavy, warm hand during the treatment. I usually have acupuncture sessions when I have significant tightness in my back and neck. Acupuncture has been a great relief in that area. I always feel a lot more relaxed, maybe 'lighter' after a session, and a little tired for the rest of the day. My session usually is very 'me-centered', physically and mentally, feeling more focused not just in what hurts but how everything feels. I always feel it also adds a lot of clarity to my thoughts as well.\" The more you receive acupuncture the less your body reads the sensations from acupuncture as painful or scary. I, personally, feel comforted by what I feel as I've learned to know that the sensations of healing and circulation will make me feel better later. Ultimately, the multiple benefits of acupuncture outweigh the short discomfort of what you might initially feel. Acupuncture can be used to treat back pain, neck and shoulder pain, knee injuries, ankle sprains, headaches, painful periods, digestive issues, sleep problems, anxiety, post surgery healing and many other conditions. Many of my patients tell me that they find the process of receiving acupuncture quite enjoyable and they look forward to their appointments. For people who feel concerned with laying during acupuncture for an extended period, I have found that those initially worried about this tend to feel comfortable after the first time. Please also know that during treatments in my practice, I tend to check in on patients every 15 minutes which seems to relieve many people's fears!
