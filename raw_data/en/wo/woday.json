In addition to the food we eat, exposure to prescription and recreational drugs, environmental pollutants, and alcohol can take its toll on the liver. As the largest internal organ, the liver is also one of the most important for keeping us \"filtered\" and functioning healthfully. Like a waste disposal plant, the liver filters blood coming from the digestive tract before it moves through the rest of the body, eliminating harmful chemicals, metabolizing drugs, secreting bile and more (performing about 500 crucial bodily functions, including synthesizing protein, producing enzymes and hormones, breaking down and recycling tired blood cells and regulating glycogen storage). Energetically, the liver can also hold onto emotions like negativity, hate, grief and anger. Fortunately, given a moment of rest, the liver has a remarkable ability to heal and rejuvenate itself. And now that spring is on the horizon, the time might be right for you to think about a liver cleanse. Unlike other parts of the body, the liver doesn't have pain receptors to signify it's in distress. Instead, symptoms might be a dull ache under the ribs on the right side of the body, right shoulder or back pain, itchy skin, fatigue, yellowing of the skin, dark urine or light-colored stools. Ready to give your liver some love? In addition to re-reading and following Dr. Stone's recommendations in \"A Daily Diet to Regain Health\" in Health Building, including utilizing his recipe for a liver flush each morning, consider using Young Living essential oils for liver support.
