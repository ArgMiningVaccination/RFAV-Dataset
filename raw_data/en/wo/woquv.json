All disease stems from the mind; Eastern medicine teaches us that the mind and body directly affect and influence one another. Modern research is proving how important the mind is in maintaining our general health. Naturopaths need to have an understanding of the history of psychology and the different schools of thought within the psychology and psychoanalysis sector. They also need to have an understanding of how the brain influences the physical body from a modern scientific perspective and have tools at hand that they can offer to their clients in order to help deal with the various stresses that we all have to cope with. This unit is therefore divided into two parts. The first part covers the history and basics of various psychotherapeutic models (the origins of psychotherapeutic intervention, psychotherapeutic intervention today, psychodynamic practice, humanistic practice, transpersonal practice and cognitive-behavioural practice) together with the different theories relating to the stress trauma response such as the polyvagal theory and Jungian personal theory. You will learn about the role of the therapeutic process, how to assess and relieve the stress-trauma manifestation, as well as psychotherapeutic strategies to implement in practice. The second part covers the stress response in more detail and the impact of stress on the physical body and its role in chronic disease. You will learn how to identify and treat adrenal fatigue, how to monitor and support stress levels, the role of flower remedies and aromatherapy. The section ends with information about different constitutional types (the four temperaments of Greek medicine, Jungian personality types, Myers Briggs, David Keirsey's personality types and the Enneagram).
