(ICH Q6B) specifications are legally binding criteria that a medicinal product must meet set of criteria that a drug substance and drug product must meet to fulfil pre -defined standards for commercial use assurance that the quality is safe and efficacious over its shelf -lifeFederal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health12 Definition Specification A specification is defined as a: -list of tests, -with references to analytical procedures, -with appropriate acceptance criteria which are numerical limits, -or ranges, -or other criteria for the tests described. It establishes the set of criteria to which a drug substance, drug product or materials at other stages of its manufacture should conform to be considered acceptable for its intended use. Definition Critical Quality Attribute (CQA) acc. ICH Q8R: A physical, chemical, biological or microbiological property or characteristic that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired product quality.Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health13 Definition Specification Conformance to specification \"Conformance to specification\" means that the drug substance and drug product, when tested according to the listed analytical procedures, will meet the acceptance criteria.Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health14 Implementation of ICH Q6B Important, critically discussed aspects Better understanding of the relative importance/relevance of specifications as part of a total control strategy Concept of heterogeneity for biotech productsFederal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health15 General Concepts Specifications are one part of a total control strategy designed to ensure product quality and consistency. Other parts of this strategy include thorough product characterisation during development, upon which many of the specifications are based, adherence to Good Manufacturing Practices, a validated manufacturing process, raw materials testing, in -process testing, stability testing, etc. Specifications are chosen to confirm the quality of the drug substance and drug product rather than to establish full characterisation and should focus on those molecular and biological characteristics found to be useful in ensuring the safety and efficacy of the product.Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health16 Specification as part of a total control strategy Manufacturing Process IPCs Batch results Specification Facility & EquipmentStability StudiesAnalytic MethodsCharacterisationDEVELOPMENT Drug Substance Drug ProductQuality Safety EfficacyFederal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health17 Control Strategy per ICH Q10 / Q11 Control Strategy: A planned set of controls , derived from current product and process understanding, that assures process performance and product quality. The controls can include parameters and attributes related to drug substance and drug product materials and components, facility and equipment operating conditions, in - process controls, finished product specifications, and the associated methods and frequency of monitoring and control.Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health18 CS acc. to ICH Q11 (Step2) A control strategy can include, but is not limited to, the following: Controls on material attributes (including raw materials, starting materials, intermediates, reagents, primary packaging materials for the drug substance, etc.); Procedural Controls implicit in the design of the manufacturing process (e.g., choice of reagents or media, sequence of operations); In-process controls (including in -process tests and process parameters); Controls on drug substance (e.g., release testing).Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health19 Manufacturig Process Development Drug Substance Critical Quality Attributes A CQA is a physical, chemical, biological, or microbiological property or characteristic that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired product quality. Potential drug substance CQAs are used to guide process development. The list of potential CQAs can be modified as drug substance knowledge and process understanding increase. Drug substance CQAs typically include those properties or characteristics that affect identity, purity, biological activity and stabilityFederal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health20 Manufacturig Process DevelopmentRisk assessment: Linking Material Attributes and Process Parameter to Drug Substance CQAs (ICH Q11, step 2) The development program should identify which material attributes (e.g., of raw materials, starting materials, reagents, solvents, process aids, intermediates) and process parameters should be controlled. Risk assessment can help identify the material attributes and process parameters with the potential for having an effect on drug substance CQAs. Those material attributes and process parameters that are found to be important should be addressed by the control strategy Using a traditional approach , material specifications and process parameter ranges can be based primarily on batch process history and univariate experiments. An enhanced approach can lead to a more thorough understanding of the relationship of material attributes and process parameters to CQAs and the effect of interactions.Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health21 Manufacturig Process Development Risk assessment: Linking Material Attributes and Process Parameter to Drug Substance CQAs (ICH Q11 step2) Using an enhanced approach, the determination of appropriate material specifications and process parameter ranges could follow a sequence as shown below: Identify potential sources of process variability ; Identify the material attributes and process parameters likely to have the greatest impact on drug substance quality . This can be based on prior knowledge and risk assessment tools Design and conduct experiments and/or mechanistic studies (e.g., multivariate Design of Experiments, simulations, modelling) to identify and confirm the links and relationships of material attributes and process parameters to drug substance CQAs ; Conduct analysis of the data to establish appropriate ranges , including establishment of a design space if desired.

Since the heterogeneity of these products defines their quality , the degree and profile of this heterogeneity should be characterised, to assure lot -to-lot consistency. When these variants of the desired product have properties comparable to those of the desired product with respect to activity, efficacy and safety, they are considered product -related substances. When process changes and degradation products result in heterogeneity patterns which differ from those observed in the material used during preclinical and clinical development, the significance of these alterations should be evaluated (Q5E).Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health28 Special Features of Biologics -Why are They Different?

Limits are justified based on critical information gained from the entire process spanning the period from early development through commercial scale production. For certain impurities, testing of either the drug substance or the drug product may not be necessary and may not need to be included in the specifications if efficient control or removal to acceptable levels is demonstrated by suitable studies (Process Validation/Evaluation, e.g. small scale studies.) Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health68 In-process acceptance criteria and action limits In-process tests are performed at critical decision making steps and at other steps where data serve to confirm consistency of the process during the production of either the drug substance or the drug product. The results of in -process testing may be recorded as action limits or reported as acceptance criteria. Performing such testing may eliminate the need for testing of the drug substance or drug product Data obtained during development and validation runs should provide the basis for provisional action limits to be set for the manufacturing process. These limits, which are the responsibility of the manufacturer, may be used to initiate investigation or further action. They should be further refined as additional manufacturing experience and data are obtained after product approval.Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health69 In Process Controls IPCs are of significant importance to demonstrate consistency of the manufacturing process in a defined production site under defined condition equivalence after a change of the manufacturing process Comparability (ICH Q5E) equivalence after Up -Scaling\" Comparability equivalence in a new manufacturing site ComparabilityFederal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health70 In Process Controls Examples:* Fermentation Purification -cell number/ cell agents at the end of cell culture is an example of testing for which acceptance criteria should be established. *not exhaustiveFederal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health71 Raw materials and excipient specifications The quality of the raw materials used in the production of the drug substance (or drug product) should meet standards, appropriate for their intended use. Biological raw materials or reagents may require evaluation to establish the presence or absence of endogenous or adventitious agents (TSE, Virus) Certain affinity chromatography (for example, employing monoclonal antibodies, Protein A, Affi Blue) should be accompanied by appropriate measures to ensure that such process -related impurities or potential contaminants arising from their production and use do not compromise the quality and safety of the drug substance or drug product. The quality of the excipients used as well as the container/closure systems, should meet pharmacopoeial standards, where available and appropriate. Otherwise, suitable acceptance criteria should be established for the non -pharmacopoeial excipients.Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health72 Setting Specifications -Considerations - Which (key / critical??) product quality attributes should be specified and merit control throughout the clinical development?

In such circumstances, test results should be considered as in -process acceptance criteria Requires a sufficient understanding of sources of variability and their impact on downstream processes , in-process materials (including intermediates), and drug substance/ drug product quality. Before shifting controls upstream, applicants should determine that factors later in the process (i.e., downstream) from the point of control will not compromise effective control. RTRT (real time release testing)Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health78 Considerations in Developing a Control Strategy (acc.to ICHQ11 step2) Traditional and enhanced approach, For drug substances that are particularly sensitive to factors such as temperature changes, oxidation, light, ionic content, and shear (e.g., most biotechnological products), these factors should be considered before implementing upstream approaches to attribute control. When in -process controls are used in lieu of testing of specific drug substance attributes, these controls should be described and justified. A drug substance should have a specification even when utilising real time release testing .Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health79 Drug Substance Specification The following tests and acceptance criteria are considered applicable to all drug substances : Appearance and description Identity (more than 1 test) Quantity Purity (Combination of methods) Impurities (process/product related) Potency Variants pH-, bioburden,endotoxin etc. Other tests are product dependent.Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health80 Drug Product Specification The following tests and acceptance criteria are considered applicable to all drug products : Pharmacopoeial requirements apply to the relevant dosage forms. include, but are not limited to -sterility, -endotoxin, -microbial limits, -volume in container, -particulate matter, -uniformity of dosage units, -moisture content for lyophilised drug products General tests -pH and osmolarityFederal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health81 Drug Product Specification The following tests and acceptance criteria are considered applicable to all drug products : Appearance and description Identity (more than 1 test may be necessary) Quantity ( Protein content or Units) Purity (Combination of methods) Degradation Products Impurities -Potency (When an appropriate potency assay is used for the drug substance, an alternative method (physicochemical and/or biological) may suffice for quantitative assessment of the drug product. Rationale to be provided.Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health82 Drug Product Specification and Stability Purity and impurities -Impurities may be generated or increased during manufacture and/or storage of the drug product. -These may be either the same as those occurring in the drug substance itself, process related, or degradation products which form specifically in the drug product during formulation or during storage. -If impurities are qualitatively and quantitatively (i.e., relative amounts and/or concentrations) the same as in the drug substance, testing is not necessary. -If impurities are known to be introduced or formed during the production and/or storage of the drug product, the levels of these impurities should be determined and acceptance criteria established. -Acceptance criteria and analytical procedures should be developed, to measure changes in the drug substance during the manufacture and/or storage of the drug product. -The choice and optimisation of analytical procedures should focus on the separation of the desired product and product -related substances from impurities including degradation products, and from excipients.Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Health83 Release Limits vs. Shelf -life Limits The concept of release limits vs. shelf -life limits may be applied where justified. This concept pertains to the establishment of limits, which are tighter for the release than for the shelf -life of the drug substance or drug product. Examples where this may be applicable include potency and degradation products. Stability Studies In some regions, the concept of release limits may only beapplicable to in -house limits and not to the regulatory shelf -life limits.Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices The BfArM is a Federal Institute within the portfolio of the Federal Ministry "}
