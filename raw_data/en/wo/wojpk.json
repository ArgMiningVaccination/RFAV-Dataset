Qi is responsible for the communication between all cells, organs and systems in the body. It is vital to our wellbeing, relieving physical and emotional pain, increasing vitality and enhancing the body's self-healing capacity. With his sensitive touch, Master Oh can feel how energy is circulating in your body and where it is blocked. He is also able to assess your energy reserves. He then works on your entire body, applying gentle acupressure on the main energy points to release blockages, clear toxins and recharge your energy system. Throughout the treatment he uses a breathing technique to make a sound vibration that transmits Qi deep into the energy channels. After the treatment, many people experience relief from pain, stress and anxiety, as well as a new sense of calm, lightness and increased mental clarity. "}
