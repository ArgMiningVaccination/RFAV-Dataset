These conditions are chronic in nature and are defined by criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Major characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder) are as follows: n Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): A disorder characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, including restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities causing significant impairments of functioning. n Intellectual Disability/Intellectual Developmental Disorder (ID): A disorder characterized by both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in conceptual, social, and practical domains. Given the early onset and life-long nature of these conditions, as well as the complexity of symptoms and high prevalence of comorbid conditions, these children and their families require a multi-faceted approach to care that integrates therapy, medication management, and community engagement. Treating children and adolescents with these conditions can be challenging, especially since empirically supported treatments are not always readily available. purpose The purpose of the 2019 Autism Spectrum Disorder & Intellectual Developmental Disorder: Florida Best Practice Psychotherapeutic Medication Recommendations for Target Symptoms in Children and Adolescents is to provide recommendations for psychotherapeutic medication prescribing based on the latest evidence and clinical consensus for a range of severe behavioral health symptoms and diagnoses often seen in children and adolescents with ASD or ID. proCess for Crea Ting The guidelines Every two years, the Florida Medicaid Drug Therapy Management Program for Behavioral Health organizes diverse array of stakeholders known as the Florida Expert Panel to review and update the Florida Best Practice Recommendations for ASD and ID. The 2019 Florida Expert Panel consisted of local and nationally recognized experts, academicians, medical directors of Florida Medicaid health plans and community mental health centers (CMHCs), child and adolescent psychiatrists, pediatricians, primary care providers, and pharmacists. The 2019 Expert Panel met in Coral Gables, Florida on February 2, 2019 to review and update the previous version of the Florida Best Practice Psychotherapeutic Medication Recommendations, which was published after the last consensus meeting in 2017. For each condition, a child and adolescent psychiatrist who is a nationally recognized content expert conducted a full review, presented the findings to the expert panel, and made suggestions to the panel on proposed revisions. The expert panel then discussed the proposed revisions and reached a consensus about whether or not to revise and adopt a particular set of recommendations. The final recommendations are a product of both an in-depth review of the literature with an emphasis on Page 4 floridamedicaidmentalhealth.orgOrganization and Disclaimer the highest level of clinical evidence (e.g., randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews), expert consensus on the strength of the evidence, and consideration of safety and efficacy. The names of the meeting attendees and meeting presentations are available on the Program website at floridamedicaidmentalhealth.org . Financial disclosures are available upon request. organiza Tion The 2019 Autism Spectrum Disorder & Intellectual Developmental Disorder: Florida Best Practice Psychotherapeutic Medication Recommendations for Target Symptoms in Children and Adolescents (2019) cover treatment recommendations for a range of behavioral health symptoms and conditions encountered in children and adolescents with ASD and ID, including hyperactive, impulsive, and inattentive symptoms; aggression; sleep disturbances; restricted, repetitive behaviors; mood symptoms; catatonia; and psychosis. This year, the guidelines include updates in the Principles of Practice, with a focus on recommendations for medication optimization and deprescribing psychotherapeutic medications when clinically indicated. The guidelines also include a section addressing complementary and alternative treatments that have been used for Autism Spectrum Disorders. The guidelines are organized by levels of treatment recommendations, beginning with Level 0, which involves a thorough clinical assessment. Subsequent levels (Levels 1, 2, 3, etc.) are based on the strength of the scientific evidence and expert consensus regarding a particular medication or treatment option. In addition to the current evidence, the expert panel considers both safety and efficacy when assigning a treatment option to a particular level. Therefore, Level 1 has the strongest evidence and safety profile compared to subsequent levels. After a thorough assessment, clinicians are encouraged to begin treatment at Level 1. In some cases (e.g., severe symptoms), clinicians may choose to initiate treatment at a different level based on clinical judgement in conjunction with best evidence and guideline recommendations. Any decision regarding treatment should take into consideration the best evidence, practice recommendations, benefit-to-risk ratio, current symptoms, and level of impairment. disClaimer Use of these guidelines in whole or in part is entirely the responsibility of the clinician. The authors and panel members bear no responsibility for treatment decisions and outcomes based on the use of these guidelines.Page 5 floridamedicaidmentalhealth.orgPrinciples of Practice in the Context of ASD and ID Level 0 - Evaluation and Comprehensive Assessment: The goals of the initial evaluation and comprehensive assessment are to document the child's performance levels; functional abilities in cognitive, language, and social domains; contributions of genetic/metabolic etiologies; and presence of comorbid medical/neurologic disorders such as epilepsy. The evaluation and comprehensive assessment includes: F Detailed developmental and symptom history to assess the full range of psychiatric symptoms and disorders, (i.e., irritability, inattention, impulsivity, aggressive behaviors, repetitive, restricted behaviors, anxiety, depression, psychotic symptoms, and sleep disturbances) as well as impairment from these symptoms and disorders. The use of rating scales is highly recommended (See Box 1 on page 7). F A full medical history and physical examination, including: vision, hearing, and dental screening. F Assessment of diet/nutritional deficiencies, seizures, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal problems (e.g., constipation, gastric reflux), and other medical problems. F Special consideration of developmental speech, language, communication, neuropsychological, and educational assessments. F Medication history, including over-the-counter, complementary, and alternative medicine. F Treatment history, including behavioral therapies, occupational therapy, speech therapy, physical therapy, all medication trials, and complementary and alternative treatments. F Assessment of family structure and functioning, including a safety assessment of the environment to identify: \u0097 Risk of harm to self or others \u0097 Nighttime wandering \u0097 Low safety awareness/ impulsivity (e.g., water safety) \u0097 Signs of abuse and/or neglect F Behavior inventory using validated rating scales and checklists to document the occurrence of specific behaviors. For a list of rating scales and diagnostic checklists, see Box 1 on page 7. For updated links to rating scales and checklists, visit floridamedicaidmentalhealth.org . Based upon results of history and physical examination, consider as clinically indicated: F Metabolic evaluation F Comprehensive psychological evaluation F Neurological consultation F Genetic consultationPage 6 floridamedicaidmentalhealth.orgLevel 1 - Evidence-Based Psychosocial Start with psychosocial and other non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., occupational therapy, speech/language therapy). Pharmacotherapy is not the primary treatment for youth with ASD and ID. Early intervention is of paramount importance to address the symptoms of ASD. Aim non-pharmacological therapy at the most impairing target symptom first. Please note, the Florida Expert Panel has added recommendations specific to each condition reviewed. See Use of Psychotherapeutic Medications in Children and Adolescents with ASD and ID on page 9. Recommended psychosocial and non-pharmacological interventions: F Behavior therapy: e.g., Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) for children under age 7; Parent Management Training (PMT) for children over age 7; Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA); Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT); and others F Speech/language therapy F Occupational therapy F Physical therapy F Social skills therapy F Special educational services (academic and life skills) Treat co-occurring medical problems (e.g., seizures). Note: Medication changes and reactions warrant consideration as to the cause of disruptive behaviors. Provide psychoeducation for parents/caregivers regarding ASD, ID, and co-occurring conditions.Principles of Practice in the Context of ASD and ID (continued)Page 7 floridamedicaidmentalhealth.orgRating Scales: F Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) F Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST) F Vanderbilt Assessment Scales F Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Second Edition (CARS-2)* F Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ)* F Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition (SRS-2)* F Conners Rating Scales* F Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)* *Not available in the public domain Diagnostic Instruments: F Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2)* F Autism Diagnostic Interview \u2014 Revised (ADI-R)* *Not available in the public domain Notes: Both the ADOS-2 and ADl-R are the \"Gold Standard\" to support the diagnosis of ASD if administered by qualified raters. The ABC can be used to assess medication responses. ABC, Vanderbilt, and Conners Rating Scales assess specific behavioral domains but are not screening tools for ASD. Sleep Screening Tools: F BEARS Sleep Screening Algorithm: Ages 2 to 18 years F Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ): Ages 4 to 12 years F Sleep diaries For updated links, visit floridamedicaidmentalhealth.org.

For updated links to rating scales and checklists, visit floridamedicaidmentalhealth.org. Early signs that may indicate a child under age 6 is at risk for ASD: F No big smile or other warm, joyful expressions by six months or later F No back-and-forth sharing of sounds, smiles, or other facial expressions by 9 months F No babbling by 12 months F No back-and-forth gestures such as pointing, showing, reaching, or waving by 12 months F No words by 16 months F No meaningful, two-word phrases (not including imitating or repeating) by 24 months F Any loss of speech, babbling, or social skills at any age Level 1 - Evidence-Based Psychosocial Treatment and Other Non- Pharmacological Interventions: Start with psychosocial and other non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., physical therapy, speech/language therapy). See Principles of Practice . Note : Pharmacotherapy is not the primary treatment for youth with ASD and ID. The use of antipsychotic medications in children under 6 years of age is generally \"off-label,\" not recommended, and should only be considered under the most extraordinary circumstances.Page 9 Although not considered first line treatment in children with ASD and ID, depending on the severity of symptoms, some medications may be helpful. If the decision is made to use medication, monitoring for side effects is essential. general Considera Tions n Prior to beginning any treatment with psychotherapeutic medications: F Consider functional behavioral assessment to identify triggers/effects of maladaptive behavior. F Weigh risks/benefits of treating with psychotherapeutic medications. F Define target symptom domain and rule out medical etiology. Aim pharmacotherapy at the most impairing target symptoms first. F Obtain resting blood pressure, heart rate, weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) percentile at baseline and follow-up visits. F Baseline and follow-up electrocardiogram (ECG) are warranted if the child has a history or evidence of cardiac disease. Considera Tions when Trea Ting wiTh anTipsy ChoTiC mediCaTions Note : See Table 1 on page 10 for full monitoring recommendations. n Prior to beginning treatment with antipsychotic medication: F Obtain height, weight, and BMI percentile. F Obtain baseline fasting glucose and lipid panel. F Complete baseline tardive dyskinesia screen (AIMS or DISCUS). F Treat concurrently with psychosocial interventions. n At treatment initiation: F Clearly establish the goal of antipsychotic therapy, first targeting symptoms that are most impairing. F Start low, go slow. F Start with antipsychotic medications that have the greatest strength of evidence in pediatric populations (ie, risperidone or aripiprazole). F Use the minimum effective dose to minimize adverse effects. F Provide healthy lifestyle information. n Follow-up medication monitoring: F Monitor BMI. F Obtain fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), lipid panel, and tardive dyskinesia screen at least every 6 months; repeat more frequently if there is rapid weight gain or signs of abnormal movement. Consider total insulin level in those with significant weight gain or early evidence of metabolic derangement. n Not recommended: F Use of antipsychotic psychosocial treatment(s). (Symbyax\u00ae) as first or second-line agents; use in patients who are overweight or obese, dyslipidemic, or hyperglycemic. Note: Overweight is defined as BMI >85th percentile for age and sex, weight for height >85th percentile, or weight >120% of ideal weight.Use of Psychotherapeutic Medications in Children and Adolescents with ASD and IDPage 10 Recommended Routine Monitoring in Youth with ASD and ID Treated with Antipsychotic Agents Table 1.

Obtain information from collateral sources such as parents/family members, teachers/school, and other care providers. Refer to the Principles of Practice. n Develop a comprehensive treatment plan, including evidence-based psychosocial interventions. n Be clear about the reasons for deprescribing psychotherapeutic medication. n Identify medications than can be reduced or discontinued. n In cases of polypharmacy, reduce or discontinue only one medication at a time. n Consider factors such as: F The target symptoms for which the medications are prescribed F Evidence-base for use F Medication benefit F Risk of medication-related adverse effects F Potential for drug-drug interactions. n Start with medications: F Without a clear indication. F If after assessment, it remains unclear what symptoms the medication was targeting.Page 16 floridamedicaidmentalhealth.orgMedication Optimization and Deprescribing in Children and Adolescents with ASD and ID (continued) F With the least evidence of efficacy for the symptoms the medication is prescribed to treat. n Develop a monitoring plan, including safety risk monitoring. n If symptoms recur once a medication is reduced or stopped, first wait and observe. Symptom exacerbation may be self-limited and related to medication withdrawal. Consider the presence of external stressors, and reinforce therapeutic support strategies. n If symptoms persist, review the differential diagnosis and treatment plan. Consider updating the treatment plan if indicated.

F Biologically-based interventions include dietary interventions (for example, elimination diets, vitamin supplements, and herbal remedies); chelation therapy; and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. F Non biologically-based CAM interventions include mind-body practices (for example, meditation, music therapy, yoga); manipulative and body-based treatments (for example, acupuncture); and energy medicine (homeopathy, Reiki). whaT is The sTaTe of The eviden Ce for Cam Therapy in The ConTexT of asd ? n There is a lack of high-quality research on complementary and alternative approaches to treat symptoms of ASD. n Treatments such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and chelation therapy have no scientific evidence supporting their use for ASD symptoms and the risks outweigh known benefits. n CAM treatments are not recommended to be used in place of conventional treatments.

Page 21 floridamedicaidmentalhealth.orgTreatment of Hyperactive, Impulsive, and Inattentive Symptoms in the Context of ASD and ID Youth with ASD and ID experience symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention (ADHD) at higher rates than their neurotypical peers. Children and adolescents can benefit from the same evidence-based treatments used to treat ADHD uncomplicated by ASD. Level 0 - Comprehensive Assessment: See Principles of Practice . In addition, give special consideration to: F Developmental history and cognitive assessment (neuropsychological or educational) F ADHD symptom history F Parent and teacher rating scales (e.g., Vanderbilt Assessment Scales, Conners Parent and Teacher Rating Scales)* Note: Conners Parent and Teacher Rating Scales are not in the public domain. F Teacher behavior reports F Involvement in community resources F Physical examination (e.g., if history of staring spells or focal neurological signs: EEG, MRI). F Safety concerns related to significant impulsivity (e.g., bolting away, darting across roads, excessive climbing). Level 1 - Methylphenidate or guanfacine monotherapy. If child has significant symptoms, consider methylphenidate or guanfacine as a first line medication. F Use methylphenidate or guanfacine (both immediate-release and extended- release) with caution since adverse behavioral effects may be higher in youth with ASD and ID compared to normally developing youth with ADHD. Methylphenidate or guanfacine yield benefit in about 50% of children in the ASD and ID population for hyperactivity. Close monitoring is recommended, and lower dosing than expected may be required for tolerability. F Methylphenidate is favored over guanfacine for treatment of inattention without hyperactivity. \u0097 Obtain resting blood pressure and heart rate at baseline and follow-up visits. \u0097 ECG is recommended if the child has evidence of cardiac disease or known family history of sudden death. Consult a pediatric cardiologist before initiating treatment. \u0097 Continue to increase dose until ADHD symptoms are adequately controlled, maximun recommended dosing is reached, or treatment- limiting side effects emerge. Refer to Tables 3-7 on pages 23-29 for dosing recommendations.Page 22 floridamedicaidmentalhealth.orgTreatment of Hyperactive, Impulsive, and Inattentive Symptoms in the Context of ASD and ID (continued) Level 2 - Combination therapy with methylphenidate and guanfacine OR atomoxetine: F 2a. If partial response to monotherapy (i.e., methylphenidate or guanfacine alone), consider combination therapy with methylphenidate and guanfacine. F 2b. Atomoxetine \u0097 Obtain resting blood pressure and heart rate at baseline and follow- up visits. \u0097 Consider ECG if there is evidence of cardiac disease or known family history of sudden death. Consult a pediatric cardiologist. \u0097 Consider liver function tests if on other medications or history of hepatic dysfunction. Refer to Tables 3-7 on pages 23-29 for dosing recommendations.

F A full developmental assessment. F A full medical history, including a sleep history. F A relevant medical work-up, physical examination, and nutritional status evaluation. F If relevant, an assessment of school functioning including academic, behavioral, and social aspects. F An assessment of family psychiatric history which includes past and current history of parental psychiatric illnesses, substance abuse and treatment history of parents, parent figures (e.g., step-parent), siblings, and other relatives. F An assessment of family structure and functioning, parent-child relationship and interaction. F An assessment of environmental risk factors and stressors including any history of abuse (physical, sexual) or neglect, traumatic life events, domestic violence, economic instability, etc. Notes: Effort should be made to communicate between primary care providers, psychiatrists, caseworkers, and other team members to ensure integrated care. Prior to initiating any intervention (e.g., psychosocial, medication), assess and document the risks/benefits of treatment. Education of children should be age-appropriate and targeted to the condition. Children and parents/legal guardians should be educated about the risks and benefits of treatment, including review of boxed warnings. Written informed consent should be obtained from the parents/legal guardian (i.e., the individual legally able to consent to medical interventions) and documented in the chart.appendi CesPage 42 floridamedicaidmentalhealth.orgLevel 1 Start with evidence-based psychosocial treatment (e.g., parent training). Parental involvement is essential with involvement by other caregivers or school-based interventions as needed. Provide a comprehensive treatment plan to treat target symptoms and monitor treatment progress. F Monitor response to treatment using reliable and valid measures of changes in the target symptoms. F In mild cases, attempt a course of at least 12 weeks of psychosocial interventions before considering medication. Consider a trauma-informed treatment approach as appropriate. F In moderate to severe cases, a higher level of intervention may be appropriate. F Treatment should be individualized. Level 2 If medications are being considered, first reassess the diagnosis and diagnostic formulation. Weigh the risks and benefits of initiating treatment with psychotherapeutic medications. The long-term effects of antipsychotic medication use in children is not well studied. If a decision is made to initiate medication: F Initiate with monotherapy. Start low, go slow. Take into consideration the pharmacokinetics of the medication (i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion). F Except in rare cases, use monotherapy. F Continue psychosocial treatment during treatment with medication. F If possible, monitor effectiveness of interventions with pertinent rating scales. F Use the lowest effective medication dose. F Monitor for adverse effects of medications. F After 6 to 9 months of stabilization, plan down titration trial (i.e., taper or discontinuation trial) to determine whether or not the medication is still needed and effective. F Continue psychosocial treatment during treatment with medication. F Use of psychotherapeutic medication in children under the age of 24 months is not recommended unless there are rare and extenuating circumstances. Additional Considerations: F Once medications are initiated, continue routine monitoring for medication benefits and side-effects. F If medication is no longer beneficial, consider deprescribing (refer to deprescribing recommendations). Monitor for symptom exacerbation. Principles of Practice Regarding the Use of Psychotherapeutic Medication in Children under Age 6 (continued)Page 43 floridamedicaidmentalhealth.orgThe use of antipsychotic medications in preschoolers (children under 6 years of age) is generally \"off-label\", not recommended and should only be considered under the most extraordinary circumstances. Disruptive aggression in autism is one such circumstance. Adequately powered studies have not been conducted in children under age 6. Before considering pharmacological treatment for children under age 6, the following guidelines are strongly recommended: 1. Patient has developmentally appropriate, comprehensive psychiatric assessment with diagnoses, impairments, treatment target and treatment plans clearly identified and documented. 2. Patient assessment must include evaluation of parental psychopathology and treatment needs, as well as family functioning. 3. Patient's psychosocial treatments should precede the use of psychotherapeutic medications and should continue if medications are prescribed.

F An assessment of family psychiatric history which includes past and current history of parental psychiatric illnesses, substance abuse and treatment history of parents, parent figures (e.g., step-parent), siblings, and other relatives. F An assessment of family structure and functioning, parent-child relationship and interaction. F An assessment of environmental risk factors and stressors including history of abuse (physical, sexual) or neglect, traumatic life events, domestic violence, economic instability, etc. Notes: Effort should be made to communicate between primary care providers, psychiatrists, caseworkers, and other team members to ensure integrated care. Prior to initiating any intervention (e.g., psychosocial, medication), assess the risks/benefits of treatment. Education of children should be age-appropriate and targeted to the condition. Children/adolescents and parents/legal guardians should be educated about the risks and benefits of treatment, including review of boxed warnings. Written informed consent should be obtained from the parents/legal guardian (i.e., the individual legally able to consent to medical interventions) and documented in the chart.Page 45 floridamedicaidmentalhealth.orgPrinciples of Practice Regarding the Use of Psychotherapeutic Medications in Children Ages 6 to 17 Years Old (continued) Level 1 Start with psychosocial treatment. Parental involvement is essential, with involvement of other caregivers or school-based interventions as needed. F Provide a comprehensive treatment plan to treat target symptoms and monitor treatment progress. Monitor response to treatment using reliable and valid measures of changes in the target symptoms. F In mild cases, attempt a course of at least 12 weeks of psychosocial interventions before considering medication. F In moderate to severe cases, a higher level of intervention may be appropriate as the initial step. Level 2 If medications are being considered, first reassess the diagnosis and diagnostic formulation. Weigh the risks and benefits of initiating treatment with psychotherapeutic medications. If a decision is made to initiate medication: F Initiate with monotherapy. Start low, go slow. F Except in rare cases, use monotherapy. F Continue psychosocial treatment during treatment with medication. F Monitor for suicidality. F Monitor for adverse effects of medications. F The use of antipsychotics should be restricted to the diagnoses of schizophrenia (rare in children), mania/bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, drug induced psychosis, Tourette's syndrome and tic disorders, and in some cases, severe aggression as a target symptom. F On rare occasions, antipsychotics may be used in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) after extensive cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or failure of two adequate selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) trials. F Antipsychotics should not be used primarily to target ADHD symptoms or as sedatives in children. F There may be instances where antipsychotics are used for parasuicidal and severe self-injurious behaviors. Additional Considerations: F Once medications are initiated, continue routine monitoring for medication benefits and side-effects. For children on long-term, continuous antipsychotic use, at minimum, yearly re-assessment of medication benefits and side-effects is recommended. F If medication is no longer beneficial, consider deprescribing (refer to deprescribing recommendations). Monitor for symptom exacerbation. F Consider a trauma-informed treatment approach as appropriate.Page 46 floridamedicaidmentalhealth.orgGeneral Procedures for Monitoring Side Effects of Antipsychotic Medication in Children and Adolescents Conduct side effect and metabolic assessments and laboratory tests that are clinically relevant, comprehensive, and based on established guidelines.

The American Diabetic Association recommends testing hemoglobin A1c every 3 years beginning at age 10 or onset of puberty in children who are overweight and have two or more risk factors for metabolic syndrome or Type 2 DM. For individuals receiving antipsychotic medications, the American Diabetic Association and American Psychiatric Association recommend metabolic monitoring as noted in Table 1 1 on page 48. If metabolic abnormalities are present, refer to the primary care physician for further evaluation/treatment and integrate care. Page 48 floridamedicaidmentalhealth.orgTable 11.

Notes: In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, results should be confirmed by repeat testing. The epidemiological studies that form the basis for recommending A1c to diagnose diabetes includes only adult populations. prola CTin moni Toring n There is a relationship between prolactin elevation and atypical antipsychotics. Although evidence does not support need for routine monitoring of prolactin levels in asymptomatic youths, surveillance for signs/symptoms of prolactin elevation (e.g., gynecomastia, galactorrhea, irregular menses) is recommended. n When symptoms of elevated prolactin develop, consider decreasing the dose of the atypical antipsychotic, switching to a different atypical antipsychotic, or discontinuing medication.
