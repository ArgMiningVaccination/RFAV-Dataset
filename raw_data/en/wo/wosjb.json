Cancer World was formerly published as Cancer Futures - it has a new name and a new look, but its aimis the same: to help reduce the unacceptablenumber of deaths from cancer that arecaused by late diagnosis and inadequatecancer care.We know that our success in preventingand treating cancer depends on many factors. Tumour biology, the extent of avail-able knowledge and the nature of caredelivered all play a role. But equally impor-tant are the political, financial and bureau-cratic decisions that affect how far andhow fast innovative therapies and tech-nologies are adopted into mainstream prac-tice. Cancer World explores the complexity of cancer care from all these very differentviewpoints, and offers you an insight intothe myriad decisions that shape your professional world. We hope the magazinewill become a lively forum for discussionand debate.The strength of Cancer World lies not only in this broad approach, but also in its com-mitment to exploring issues through thelives and work of those in the field. We willgive a voice to health professionals in allfields and at all levels, and offer a platformto those who are most affected by cancer -Kathy Redmond IEDITOR the people with the disease. We will include in-depth interviews with some ofEurope's most influential oncology leaders,who will be invited to comment on break-ing news, discuss complex and difficultissues and share their experiences in overcoming personal and professional challenges as they have pushed forwardsthe boundaries of their practice.People with a high public profile also havean important impact on cancer care - theyshape public attitudes towards cancer andinfluence how cancer services are deliveredand research is conducted. In each issue ofCancer World we will feature an interview with a celebrity, politician or captain ofindustry who influences the field of cancerin some way. We hope that these stories willgive our readers a broader perspective oncancer and perhaps inspire some initiativesthat will help improve the care that cancerpatients receive.Oncology is a fast moving field, whichplaces ever higher demands on us all, bothprofessionally and personally. This is yourmagazine. It aims to support you in yourjob, by addressing the issues you tackleevery day, and by giving you the informationyou need to do your job well. As Editor, I would welcome your comments and opin-ions on any of the diverse issues covered inthe magazine, as well as suggestions on top-ics for inclusion in future issues.Welcome to our World All correspondence should be sent to the Editor at magazine@esoncology.orgCoverStory Cora Sternberg: An Americanin Rome When Cora Sternberg left the Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York to make her way in Italy, she brought with her more than just expertise. From patient care to fundraising, the departmentof oncology which she heads at the San Camillo and Forlanini hospital complex in Rome nowhas a marked American flavour.Marc Beishon 4I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004\"When in Rome do the Romans\" is an old proverbthat Dr Cora Sternberg,head of medical oncologyat the city's sprawling San Camillo and Forlanini hospital complex, has dis-tinctly mixed feelings about. A high-energyAmerican by birth, she was smitten by the culturalattractions of Italy when she first came to live inRome nearly 16 years ago. But, having already madeher name as a top cancer researcher in the US,Sternberg has found the professional transitionrather more of a challenge in terms of establishinga solid base for her primary goal - first rate clinicalcancer care and research.After working in several of Rome's hospitals and in-stitutes, she became chief of medical oncology atthe San Camillo and Forlanini hospital in 2002, andin a short time has transformed the departmentfrom a place carrying out only standard treatment toa clinical trials centre with a growing reputation.Patient care, too, has been upgraded greatly sinceher arrival, using a holistic model in whichSternberg firmly believes.And from the start of her move to Italy, she waseagerly embraced by the European Organisationfor the Research and Treatment of Cancer(EORTC), such that her involvement withresearch has hardly faltered. \"At my very firstEORTC meeting I was asked to take over bladdercancer research in Europe,\" says Sternberg. \"I wassurprised - but they said they needed new blood.\"As a medical oncologist her speciality is genito-urinary cancers and, as her lengthy resum\u00e9 testifies, her name is on an exhaustive list ofpapers and worldwide conference sessions. Atpresent, Sternberg is principal investigator onseveral major protocols on prostate and bladdercancer, and last year she was elected by hercolleagues to the board of the EORTC.Like most top cancer doctors, her life is a dizzyingwhirl of international travel, long days and latenights spent writing and reviewing papers, consul-tancy and faculty positions in Europe and the US- all in addition to running a department.If the logistics of managing an international careerhave been well in hand, Sternberg has faced a bit ofa struggle with Italian bureaucracy - for example,her medical oncology accreditation was only recog- nised relatively recently in the country. But, havingstarted her career at a time when even in the USwomen were still relatively rare in the world ofmedicine, she was no stranger to adversity.It was Sternberg's first professional trip to Europethat was the catalyst for her move from America -in short, she met her husband, top laparoscopicurology surgeon Vito Pansadoro, at a conferenceand moved to Rome in 1988. Up to that point, shehad been set for outstanding success at theMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in NewYork, an institution she considers to be among thebest in the world.\"My parents came to the US from Poland duringWorld War Two - they were both professors ofmathematics,\" says Sternberg. \"My mother had al-ways wanted to be a doctor, but because of the warthis wasn't possible - and it was natural for me to think of becoming one.\"Always a good student at school, Sternberg was ac-cepted at the University of Pennsylvania, where shestudied psychology and art history - but the notionto become a doctor took hold and she went for it,taking all the maths, physics and other modulesnecessary to get into the university's medical school.\"When I arrived it was the first year they'd had asmany as 20% women - there were only a handfulbefore - and it was particularly competitive for us.We were told: 'Look to your right and to your left -one of you will not be here when you finish.' \"Once enrolled, Sternberg loved everything she did- \"If I was on a cardiology rotation, I wanted to bea cardiologist; likewise neurology and so on.\"After graduation, as an intern at Temple Universityhospital in Philadelphia, she became slightlyCoverStory CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 I 5 Sternberg has faced a bit of a struggle with Italian bureaucracydisillusioned by general hospital work and switched to psychiatry for a year at the Mount Sinai MedicalCenter in New York. \"This has helped me a lot tounderstand what depressed patients are goingthrough,\" she says, adding that at San Camillo she'sbrought in two psychologists and a psychiatrist aspart of the team who routinely work with the can-cer patients.\"I think it is a very important part of getting better -it is impossible for either patients or their family not to be scared about cancer, and we can really make a big difference with a multidisciplinary team ap-proach that includes psychologists, psychiatrists,dedicated nurses and volunteers.\"However, after one year of psychiatry training, shetransferred to Stanford University to complete herinternal medicine training. It was there that she de-cided to specialise in medical oncology. \"Back thenthere were many physicians who wanted to becomesurgeons,\" she says. \"Oncology was something peo-ple didn't understand and it was a big challenge, andin any case it was also very difficult at that time fora woman to become a surgeon in the US. I wantedto help people who were sick mostly due to no fault of their own and I saw a great need.\"Spurred on by the excellent medical oncology de-partment at Stanford - and by a few great womenrole models - Sternberg returned first to MountSinai, then to a fellowship position in medical on-cology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York.There, after being involved with a variety of re-search projects, she started working under her mainacademic mentor, Professor Alan Yagoda, whom shehad identified as \"a brilliant man\". \"He was head ofthe solid tumour services at Memorial and his re-search interest was genito-urinary cancers, which iswhy I started working in this area.\"Sternberg is very much a believer in slow but steadyprogress. She has seen good advances in cancertreatment since she started her career - \"Forexample, there are patients who are cured todaywith testicular cancer, and a better understandingof the biology of cancer has led to some break-throughs in such hard to treat cancers as gastro-intestinal stromal tumours. Patients are doing bet-ter today because of wider public knowledge aboutcancer and its symptoms, and screening pro-grammes have led to earlier diagnosis.\"There have been improvements in surgical tech-niques in addition to the progress that has beenmade with newer chemotherapeutic agents, and wehave better methods of overcoming the side effectsof chemotherapy.\"An important breakthrough came for Sternbergwhile working with Yagoda. He had been active inbladder cancer for years, she says, and proposed anew combination of chemotherapy based on his re-search. However, Yagoda became ill and Sternbergand a colleague, Howard Scher (now chief ofgenito-urinary oncology at Memorial), took thework forward and developed what has become the\"gold standard\" for treating relatively fit patientswith advanced bladder cancer, namely the M-VACchemotherapy regimen.\"Before, patients with advanced bladder cancer CoverStory 6I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 \"This has helped me a lot to understand what depressed patients are going through\" With her mentor, Professor AlanYagoda,at theMemorial Sloan-Kettering CancerCenter in New Yorkeither died or lived at most six months,\" says Sternberg. \"We started seeing cures - it was ab-solutely amazing. The first presentations of thiswork at the American Urological Association and atthe American Society of Clinical Oncology weregreeted with both scepticism and enthusiasm bythe medical community. However, today no regi-men has yet proven to be more effective.\"As Yagoda wanted to cut down on his workload, hesent his young colleagues off to international con-ferences - Scher to Australia and Sternberg to aurology conference in Erice, Sicily. It was her firstprofessional trip to Europe and turned out to be alife changing experience.\"As I was first author on the M-VAC papers, theEuropeans were expecting to see an elderly profes-sor and were rather surprised,\" she says. \"Since thiswas my first important European meeting, I spenta lot of time in my room studying, to make the mostof the conference. The last thing I thought was thatI'd meet my future husband there.\"However, on the last day, at a social event after themeeting, \"Vito Pansadoro, a urology professor, askedme to dance. We fell in love on the dance floor, witheveryone else stopping to watch. It really happenedas though in a fairy tale.\"With M-VAC so new, she continued on to Londonon that European trip to give further talks. \"I'll nev-er forget an English physician who asked, 'Wouldyou give your mother this therapy?' and I looked athim and said, 'You don't know my mother - shedoesn't listen to anything I say,' and everyone justbroke up laughing.\"The work on M-VAC brought Sternberg to interna-tional attention, but at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering she also worked on kidney cancer - shewas head of the interleukin-2 LAK programmethere - and on prostate and testicular cancers. So ittook a while to wind down her commitments inNew York. She got married in 1988 and moved toItaly. She's since been much in demand at many on-cology and urology conferences - \"There are fewergenito-urinary oncologists than let's say breast can- cer specialists,\" she says. But she doesn't feel herfield has a less high profile than breast or lungcancer - certainly not now that prostate cancer hasbecome recognised as one of the most commonforms of the disease.\"It's true that prostate cancer was felt in the past notto respond well to therapy,\" she says. \"But more hasbecome known about discovering it earlier, andthere has been an important decrease in mortalitysince there has been widespread PSA [prostate spe-cific antigen] testing. There were two highlightedpapers at the plenary session of the AmericanSociety of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conferencein June on this disease.\"She adds that prostate cancer has also becomerecognised as a chemosensitive disease, and thereis a series of new molecular targeted therapies.\"There is plenty of interesting research to be done.We have many protocols running at present for pa-tients with all stages of prostate cancer.\"Other studies she has in course include an inter-group protocol on bladder cancer, a US trial whereshe is the European coordinator, several others withpromising molecular targeted therapies and newchemotherapeutic agents for colon, kidney, stom-ach, breast and lung cancers and melanoma. At SanCamillo and Forlanini hospital the major specialistpathologies are gastro-intestinal and lung cancers,while of course Sternberg has been attracting muchinterest in genito-urinary research. But there waslittle cancer research of any kind in her departmentbefore her arrival at the hospital.Up until 2002, Sternberg had worked in severalhospitals in Rome, first as a medical oncology con-sultant at the well-known Regina Elena CancerInstitute. As she notes, it is hard to penetrate theItalian health system - there is a lot of bureaucracyin filling public appointments, and she ruffled somefeathers by being invited in as a consultant and be-ing sent to international meetings.After another consultancy position, at Rome's CTO CoverStory CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 I 7Out has gone... arcane rules, such as barring visits from patients' childrenHospital, she became head of medical oncology at a private hospital, the San Raffaele ScientificInstitute, which was set up as an offshoot of Milan'shospital of the same name.Then it was on to San Camillo and Forlanini, one ofEurope's biggest hospitals. Sternberg's departmentis in one of many large, airy but dilapidated pre-World War Two buildings. While she's been prom-ised major refurbishment - and the nearby remod-elled emergency and surgical pavilion shows whatcan be done - she has transformed matters inother ways.Out has gone an emphasis on very long admissionsand arcane rules, such as barring visits from pa-tients' children. Instead, she has put together ateam of motivated doctors and nurses, focused onmore day hospital treatments, and there's been aturnaround in attitudes towards patient care - aswell as enrolment in clinical trials. She's also takena lead in banning smoking from her department andfrom the hospital.Sternberg has ushered in the kind of infrastructure she'd take for granted back in America - comput-erised records, proper patient charts, team meet-ings within the department and multidisciplinarymeetings with colleagues in other departments.At San Camillo, the critical resource is people - sheis as yet only halfway through a recruitmentprogramme for oncologists, and like many publichospitals in Europe, the department has sufferedmajor nursing shortages. There's also the problemwith a lengthy procedure to appoint staff - andwhile she works on permanent changes she's evenbrought in people on her own.So the staff complement is a mix of official and un-official personnel, plus volunteers - many of whomare personal friends of Sternberg who are enthusi-astic and give their time for free.She has recruited a Spanish data management spe-cialist with great experience in clinical trial man-agement; another physician, an Italian professor ofpharmacology, has returned to Italy after workingfor more than seven years at the EORTC as a med-ical data manager in Brussels. These two specialistshave been \"brilliant in organising the clinical trialwork,\" says Sternberg. In a small way, too, she's al-so helping to reverse the country's oft-mentioned'brain drain' - some Italian colleagues have eitherreturned to the country to work with her, or havethought twice about leaving.Patient rights have been a major issue for Sternbergsince coming to Italy. Slowly, she says, the idea ofinformed consent has taken hold, and cancer hasbecome less of a taboo subject. \"There is so muchpublicity now about new treatments that patientsare interested and willing to be involved in trialsmost of the time. But I firmly believe that willing-ness depends on how much the doctor is convincedin what he or she is doing.\"Fifteen years ago, Sternberg's forthright, Americanapproach may have caused some alarm, such aswhen, after a liver biopsy, a patient had askedwhether his cancer had spread to the liver. \"Howcould you tell him the truth?\" asked her colleagues,\"We would have said 'we're not sure...' \" This atti-tude has since changed dramatically.\"Truth telling\" can differ widely between countries- for example a survey of cancer doctors in north-ern Italy (published in 2000, in Supportive Care in Cancer vol 8, pp 40-45), showed that one-third CoverStory 8I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 Playing the piano with daughter Tatianabelieved that \"patients never want to know the truth\". And even a revised version of the Italian\"deontology\" code allows for some degree of with-holding the truth from the patient, if not their fam-ily. While strongly defending the need to tell thetruth, Sternberg admits to being \"softer in her ap-proach than perhaps I was in the US,\" and theadded psychological support she's brought in hasbeen crucial. \"The patients know that we are readyto fight with them and they know that they can trustour team.\" At the hospital, apart from promoting apositive, caring attitude for her staff, she's had to tellpatients and concerned family members that theyhave every right to make appointments with theirphysicians - but she has had to educate them inproper procedure. There's certainly more calm andorder since she has taken over.There is a tremendous ambition to establish thehospital as a major cancer referral centre, workingwith colleagues at other important institutions inItaly such as the Regina Elena in Rome. Sternbergis bringing in as many resources as she can muster in the fight against the disease generally, and knowsshe cannot do this alone.In addition, she has started a fund-raising organisa-tion, the Samuel and Barbara Sternberg CancerResearch Foundation. \"It's named after my parents,because they are responsible for who I am today.\"The foundation, set up in 2003, has an impressivelist of members and a star cast of world cancer spe-cialists, and \"was initiated due to a dire and seriousneed for the support of cancer patients and re-search at San Camillo hospital.\"Sternberg says that some money has been raisedprimarily from banks and friends - but ideally she'dlike a full-time fund raiser or chief executive on thejob. She points to organisations such as theAmerican Italian Cancer Foundation (AICF),which are quite capable of raising a million dollarsat fund raising events. The AICF has granted$25,000 to a research fellow who is doing basic sci-entific research in Italy under Sternberg's guidance. CoverStory CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 I 9 \"The patients know that we are ready to fight with them and they know that they can trust our team\"With children Tatiana and Vincenzoand husbandVito Pansadoro ( front row) and brother Harvey ( second row ) and his family inPhiladelphia\"My approach to raising money is perhaps American,\" she says. \"I'd say also that organisationssuch as the EORTC need to raise funds in Europefor research without upsetting national institutions.They've been hesitant to do this so far, but this kindof work needs to be done by professional fund rais-ers.\" Those funds are especially needed, she adds,for trials that may not interest the pharmaceuticalcompanies. She's particularly concerned, alongwith other members of the EORTC, about theEuropean Union's Clinical Trials Directive, whichostensibly aims to promote multinational trials. Butit could pose a threat to non-commercial medicaloncology research, one reason being that pharma-ceutical companies may be unwilling to supply free,licensed drugs for trials as they could be deemed tobe the trial \"sponsor\", with onerous and costly re-sponsibilities. Sternberg says that there's also aproblem for smaller institutions in simply comply-ing with the directive's paperwork. \"I have two peo-ple working full time on regulatory affairs,\" shepoints out - and the worry is that basic academic re-search in some less fashionable areas may fall by thewayside. She would like to see the rules on transla-tional research clarified as well, noting that \"a lot oftrials have been done by giving drugs to patientswithout really studying the biology of the tumours.\"There is a need for \"more collaboration with basicresearch scientists.\" Sternberg is building links atpresent with the Regina Elena Cancer Centre andother research organisations in Italy, and if she getsher wish San Camillo will become a centre for drugdevelopment trials and translational molecular re-search - bridging the laboratory and the clinic. Shealso has an agreement with La Sapienza University- although San Camillo is not a teaching hospital,physicians who are training to become oncologistsnow spend time in her department, and she hopesto increase their number.Seminars and lectures are now playing a part in the day to day life of the department - the intention isalso to invite staff from other parts of the hospital sothey develop knowledge of oncology and clinicaltrials. Sternberg is also encouraging her doctors andnurses to attend national and international confer-ences and is always ready to help them prepare lec-tures. She recalls her formative period with AlanYagoda. \"The day that I was hired at Memorial hetold me that I should take a public speaking course.I never found the time for this, but he helped meanyway, as I practised my first important public lec-tures with him.\" After speaking in front of the vastaudiences at ASCO, this now holds little fear forSternberg, but she says she's very hard on herself inpreparing talks. \"I take lectures seriously and makesure that each one is different, even lecturing inItalian.\" She says that the secret is very simple: \"Youhave to study if you want to be prepared.\" On top of all this, she has a very busy family life.Sternberg is also a mother of two children.\"Vincenzo and Tatiana are my pride and joy.\" Andshe puts being a good mother as her top priority, al-though time is an issue (a card from Tatiana on heroffice wall asks her not to go to so many confer-ences...). She drives her children to school everyday and is not willing to give up that precious timewith them in the mornings, and she is always readyto help them with their homework if needed.It's certainly hard not to be impressed by Sternberg'spersonal life. Her home is a villa just outside Rome,which was in her husband's family. It has a beauti-ful garden and simple but genuine Italian food isserved. Like many Romans, they escape the cityeach August sailing, with Vito as captain and Coraas first mate. Sternberg is well established in Romenow - last year she received an award from theAmerican International Club of Rome for herachievements in the Italian healthcare system. CoverStory 10I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004\"My approach to raising money is perhaps American\" The worry is that basic academic research in some less fashionable areas may fall by the wayside\"When I think back, I believe the Italian medical community did not quite know what to make ofme,\" she told the audience at the awards dinner.While not one to seek media attention, she's beenfeatured by the BBC in rebutting the claims madein 1998 for a \"miracle\" cancer treatment by Dr LuigiDi Bella (and since disproved by the Italian govern-ment). She is a little wistful when she thinks aboutthe kinds of facilities and opportunities that areavailable for research in America, but has made amajor commitment to her family and to makingthings work in Italy. As she says, her present work-life balance in Rome would be hard to replicate inNew York. \"I also don't think that I would have beenable to have made all the contacts that I have inEurope if I'd stayed in America. Europe and myEuropean colleagues have been good to me - andthe EORTC has been particularly open towards mesince my arrival.\" She draws strength from womenrole models such as Eleanor Roosevelt, MargaretThatcher and Hillary Clinton - she's an avid biog- raphy reader of such individuals - but apart fromAlan Yagoda, she cites only her husband, Vito, andher parents as mentors in her life. \"Vito taught me that the glass is always half fullrather than half empty,\" she says. As Vito Pansadorois a surgeon, she adds, there is no professional ten-sion in the family.In their work, they have established a collaborativeapproach to cancer treatment, although they haveto be careful not to discuss medicine too much atthe dinner table.For the refurbished oncology department at SanCamillo hospital, Sternberg would like to make it aplace that people want to visit rather than run awayfrom. \"This will be done by employing the properuse of colours and space and perhaps by invitingartists to paint - it should be bright and cheery,\" shesays. Given the preponderance of art in the city, thisis certainly doing things the Roman way.CoverStory CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 I 11\"When I think back, I believe the Italian medical community did not quite know what to make of me\" Grand Round 12I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004Cancer in the year 2025 forms of cancer are simply a conse- quence of old age.With the increase in demand for treat-ment, the cost of cancer care is expect-ed to soar, creating immense challengesfor health services. While in 2025 morepatients will benefit from better diagno-sis and new treatments, technology willalso bring greater inequality to thehealth sector. It is unrealistic to assumethat the best care possible will beoffered to all patients irrespective oftheir socio-economic circumstances.Well-informed patients, with adequatefunds, will ensure that they have rapidaccess to the newest and best treat-ments. Many of these will take placeclose to patients' homes using mecha-nisms devised by innovative serviceproviders.Clinicians in Europe will continue to bedependent on technologies primarilydesigned for the world's major healthmarket - the United States - which,with 5% of the world's population, con- sumes nearly 55% of cancer medica-tion. Targeted niche drugs will be lessappealing to industry as the costs ofbringing each new generation of drugsto the market will not match the returnsfrom current blockbusters. Intraprofes-sional boundaries will blur - doctorsfrom traditionally quite distinct special-ties may find themselves doing thesame job. And clinical responsibilitieswill be assumed by health professionalswithout medical qualifications. All pro-fessionals are likely to find challenges totheir territory hard to accept. But newways of working need to be developedsoon, as the leaders of the health pro-fessions of 2025 - doctors, nurses,pharmacists and their support staff -are already in training. PREVENTION AND SCREENING At the beginning of the 21st century, 10million people in the world developedIn 2025 over three million peoplein the UK will be living with can-cer. Like diabetes, heart diseaseand asthma, cancer will becomeone of the major chronic dis- eases that impact on the way people livebut do not inexorably lead to death. Themodel will be prostate cancer, whichmen tend to live with, rather than diefrom. Progress will be made in prevent-ing cancers and even greater progresswill be made in understanding its myri-ad causes and in detecting, diagnosingand treating the disease. Refinementsof current technologies and techniques- in imaging, radiotherapy and surgery -together with the availability of targeteddrugs will make cancer a controllabledisease.Cure will still be sought, but will not bethe only satisfactory outcome. The fearthat cancer kills, still prevalent in theearly years of the 21st century, will bereplaced by an acceptance that manyOlivia Timbs and Karol Sikora How will cancer look in the year 2025 ? More than fifty UK cancer care specialists - physicians, scientists, health managers, economists, health servicewatchers - together with cancer charities and patients spent two days togetherin late 2003 asking themselves this question. Here is what they came up with.Grand Round CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 I 13 Coloured transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of a section through a cancer cell undergoing mitotic cell division SPL / GRAZIA NERIGrand Round 14I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004cancer each year. The cause of these cancers was known in roughly 75% ofcases: 3 million were tobacco related; 3million were a result of diet; and 1.5million were caused by infection. Anti-smoking initiatives were considered tobe successful - although it took 50years from the time the associationbetween smoking and cancer was firstidentified. In the UK, 80% of the popu-lation smoked in the 1960s; in 2003 thefigure fell to 30%, but masked realhealth inequality (the percentage ofsmokers in the higher socio-economicbracket fell to single figures, whileremaining around 50% in the lowersocio-economic bracket). Banningsmoking in public places will lead to afurther drop of about 4%.Lessons from anti-smoking initiativeswill be instructive for prevention in thefuture. Although the link between poordiet, obesity, lack of exercise and cancerhas not yet been confirmed, there issufficient circumstantial evidence tosuggest that strong associations will befound. Long before 2025 there will bebans on advertising for crisps, sweetsand soft drinks on television. A health tax on these products will beintroduced and sponsorship of publicevents by manufacturers of these prod-ucts will be banned. By 2010, obesityamong the middle classes will be socially unacceptable, but will remaincommon among the economically dis-advantaged.The future prevention picture will becoloured by post-genomic research. In2003, it was accepted that about 100genes were associated with the develop-ment of a whole range of cancers.Carrying a changed version of a particu-lar gene - or combination of changedgenes - will not necessarily lead to thedevelopment of that cancer but willincrease the risk. By 2025 most peoplewill be genetically mapped. The infor-mation - gained from a simple bloodtest - will be easily stored on a smart-card. Legislation will be required to pre-vent this information being used todetermine an individual's future healthstatus for mortgage, insurance andemployment purposes. However, theprocess of mapping and screening willreveal a predisposition to certain dis-eases and people will have to learn to live with risk.In the early years of the 21st century,the average age of diagnosis of cancerwas 68. This figure is expected to fall by2025 as a result of improvements inscreening, detection and diagnosis.Predisposition for certain cancers whichtend to manifest themselves when thepatient is 70 or 80, will be detected inyoung adult life and corrected success-fully when the patient is 30. And whileincreasing age will remain the strongestrisk predictor, the computing power ofthe future will bring accurate calcula-tion of risk factors, and predictions willtake place on an unimaginable scale.Screening programmes will be devel-oped on a national basis and novelproviders of risk assessment services arelikely to emerge. DETECTING CANCER By 2003 it was established that cancerswere fundamentally somatic geneticdiseases that result from several causes:physical, viral, radiation and chemicaldamage. Other processes - chronicinflammatory change, immuno-surveil-lance and failure of apoptosis, were alsoimplicated. By 2025 cancer will nolonger be understood as a single entity -it will be considered to be a cellularprocess that changes over time. In 2003most diagnoses of cancer depended onhuman interpretation of changes in cellstructures seen through a microscope.By 2025 microscopes will be supersed-ed by a new generation of scanners thatdetect molecular changes and can build THE NEW DIAGNOSTICS Radiology and pathology will merge into cancer imaging Dynamic imaging will create a changing image of biochemical abnormalities Cancer changes will be detected prior to disease spread from primary site Greater precision in surgery and radiotherapy will be used for pre-cancer Molecular signatures will determine treatment choiceWill fear and anxiety be mitigated? Will the focus be increasingly on control, not cure? Should it? Will we have a generation of elderly living with chronic cancer, treated as outpatients and supported by ever-dwindling numbers of carers? Will patients rely on other patients to guide them through treatment options? Are we training for specialisms that have no future in their current form?

We will have the abilityto probe molecular events that aremarkers for early malignant change.Imaging and diagnosis will be mini-mally invasive and enable the selectionof the best and most effective targetedtreatments. Even better imaging willbe able to pick up pre-disease phasesand deal with them well before they are currently detectable. Thesetechniques will also be crucial to successful follow-up. A patient whohas a predisposition to a certain cancer process will be monitored regularly and treatment offered whennecessary. Not all cancers will bediagnosed in these early stages - some patients will inevitably fall through thescreening net. Nevertheless, there will be opportunities to offer less invasive treatment than at present. Surgeryand radiotherapy will continue, but ingreatly modified form, as a result ofdevelopments in imaging. Most significantly, surgery will become partof integrated care. Removal oftumours or even whole organs willremain necessary on occasion, butthe surgeon will be supported by 3-Dimaging, radio-labelling techniques toguide incisions and by robotic instru-ments. And although many of the newtreatments made possible byimproved imaging will be biologicallydriven, there will still be a role forradiotherapy - the most potent DNAdamaging agent - in treating cancerwith great geographical accuracy.In 2025 most cancer treatments will beable to be performed on an outpatient basis. Minimally invasive treatments willreduce the need for long stays in hospi-tal and the need to provide care close towhere patients live will be both desirableand possible. Highly sophisticated scan-ning equipment and mobile surgicalunits will be transported to where theyare required. Technicians, surgical assis-tants and nurses will provide the hands-on care, while technical support will beprovided by the new breed of clinician -a disease-specific imaging specialistworking from a remote site. Cost controlwill be an essential component of thediagnostic phase. NEW TREATMENT APPROACHES In 2025 eradication of cancer, althoughstill desirable, will no longer be the pri- mary aim of treatment. Cancers will be identified earlier and the diseaseprocess regulated in a similar way tochronic diseases such as diabetes.Surgery and radiotherapy will still havea role depending on the type of cancer,the stage at which the disease is identi-fied and the performance of new drugs,but treatment will be less aggressive.By 2025, cancer treatment will beshaped by the new generation of drugs.What they will look like is not yet appar-ent and will depend on the success ofagents currently in development. Overthe next three to five years, we willunderstand more fully what benefitscompounds such as kinase inhibitorsare likely to provide. It is estimated thatin 2003 around 500 oncology drugswere being tested in clinical trials. Ofthese, around 300 were against specific molecular targets. This number is set torise dramatically. Two thousand com-pounds will be available to enter clinicaltrials by 2006 and 5,000 by 2010. Manyof the drug candidates will be directedat the same molecular targets, andindustry is racing to screen those mostlikely to make it through the develop-ment process.So what will these drug candidates looklike? In 2003, small molecules were themain focus of research - most of themdesigned to target specific gene prod-ucts that control the biological pro-cesses associated with cancer, such transduction, bodies, cancer vaccines and gene thera- py are also being explored. While thereis great confidence in the efficacy ofthese targeted agents, their overall effi-cacy at prolonging survival is moreuncertain. Many could just be expen-sive palliatives.We are already seeing the emergence ofdrugs targeted at a molecular level -Herceptin (trastuzumab), importantin 2025 is whether a cancer has partic-ular biological or genetic characteristics.Traditional categories will continue tobe broken down and genetic profilingwill enable treatment to be targeted at In 2025 eradication of cancer... will no longer be the primary aim of treatmentGrand Round 16I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004the right patients. Patients will under- stand that treatment options willdepend on their genetic profile and therisks and benefits will be much morepredictable than today.Therapies will emerge through ourknowledge of the human genome andthe use of sophisticated bio-informatics.Targeted imaging agents will be used todeliver therapy at the screening or diag-nostic stage and technology will enablethe disease process to be tracked muchmore closely. Biomarkers will allow cli-nicians to measure whether a drug isworking on its target and, if it is not, analternative treatment strategy will besought. Tumour regression will becomeless important as clinicians look formolecular patterns of disease and itsresponse. BARRIERS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TREATMENTSInnovation in cancer treatment isinevitable. However, there are certainprerequisites for the introduction of newtherapies. The therapies must be deliver-able to the right biological target, and tothe right patient, in a way that is accept-able to patients, healthcare professionalsand society. Innovation must also be mar-keted successfully so that professionals, patients and those picking up the costunderstand the potential benefits. Theexplosion of new therapies in cancer careis going to continue and costs will remainhigh. The cost of cancer drugs in 2003was estimated to be $21bn globally, ofwhich $14bn was spent in the UnitedStates. If effective drugs emerge from theresearch and development pipeline, thecancer drug market could reach $300bnglobally by 2025, with the cost spreadingmore widely around the world.But parallel to this explosion in thera-pies and increase in costs, a number ofconfounding factors will make marketssmaller. Technology will reveal whichpatients will not respond to therapy,thus making blockbuster drugs history.Doctors will know the precise stage ofthe disease process at which treatmentis necessary. And as cancer transformsinto a chronic disease, there will be more co-morbidities and associateddrug-drug interactions.How do we balance this equation?There is a risk that pharmaceuticalcompanies will stop developing drugsfor cancer and focus instead on thera-peutic areas where there is less individ-ual variation and more scope for profit.Development costs are also rising. Tenyears ago, the average cost of developinga new cancer drug was around $400m.In 2003, it was $800m. At this rate ofgrowth, the cost of developing a newdrug in 2025 could rise to $2bn. Withthis in mind, the process of developingdrugs needs to be made faster. However, instead of research being madesimpler, changes in legislation concernedwith privacy and prior consent are mak-ing it more difficult. The EU Clinical Trials Directive willmake quick hypothesis testing trialsimpossible. To overcome such constraints regulators will have to startaccepting surrogate markers ratherthan clinical outcomes when approv-ing therapies. Outcome studies maywell move to post-registration surveil-lance of a drug's efficacy similar tocholesterol-lowering agents today. Therise of personalised medicine willmean the temptation to over-treat will disappear. Doctors and patientswill know whether a particular treat-ment is justified. The evidence will bethere to support their decisions. As aconsequence of this, treatment failure- with all its associated costs - will beless common. BARRIERS TO INTRODUCING NEW THERAPIES The drug industry will continue to compete for investment in a competitive, capitalist environment Blockbuster drugs drive profit - niche products are unattractive in today's market Personalised therapies are difficult for today's industry machine Surrogate endpoints will be essential to register new drugs MAbs Vaccines Anti-Angiogenesis Kinase Inhibitors Apoptosis Inducers Anti-Sense Gene Therapy 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020ProstateColorectalLungBreastPREDICTED NEW DRUG APPROVAL DATES FOR MOLECULAR THERAPIES IN THE USAGrand Round CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 I 17THE PATIENT 'S EXPERIENCE Two separate developments will deter-mine the patient's experience of cancercare in 2025 - increased expectationsof patients and targeted approaches todiagnosis - both of which will individu-alise care. Patients will take moreresponsibility for decisions rather thanaccepting a paternalistic \"doctor knowsbest\" approach. This will partly befuelled by the Internet and competitiveprovider systems. With patients havingaccess to a wealth of health informa-tion, they will need help in assessingrisks and benefits and determiningwhat is best for them. Hence we willhave patient brokers who will act as independent advocates guiding patientsthrough treatment options.Cancer care will be a two-way street.Patients will coach doctors and otherpatients. With so many people expectedto be living with cancer in 2025, theywill have a great deal of knowledge andexperience that professionals will needto access. There will be continuedinterest in complementary medicinescovering a wide range of talking, touch-ing and pharmacological therapies oper-ating outside the norms of conventionalmedical science. Improved regulationof practitioners in this area will enhancethe quality of care provided and lead to better organisation of services.Care in the early stages will be providednear the patient's home. Even the mostsophisticated diagnostic machinery orrobotic surgeon will be mobile. Whencancer centres developed in the mid20th century, the disease was relativelyrare and survival low. In 2025, cancerwill be common and when in-patientcare will be required, patients will beable to be treated at a 'cancer hotel'. Formany, that option will not be necessaryas most new drugs will be administeredorally, enabling the patients to be treat-ed in their communities. The new At this rate of growth, the cost of developing a new drug in 2025 could rise to $2bn Immunofluorescent Light Micrograph of squamous carcinoma cells, cultured from a tumour SPL / GRAZIA NERIGrand Round 18I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004approach, however, will place a huge burden on social services and families,necessitating psychological and physi-cal support systems.In 2003, 70% of the cancer budget wasspent on care associated with the lastsix months of people lives. Althoughmany recognised that such treatmenthad more to do with the management offear rather than the management ofcancer, medical professionals had rela-tively few treatment options availableand there was limited awareness ofwhich patients would benefit. Therewas also an institutional reluctance todestroy patients' hopes that led to con-fusion between the limits of conven-tional medicines and a reluctance toface the inevitable - by patients, theirfamilies and doctors.By 2025 much of the fear associated withcancer in the past will be mitigated. Painrelief and the control of other symptomsassociated with cancer treatment will bemuch improved. Demand for treatmentswith few side-effects or lower toxicity willbe high, even if there are only quite mod-est survival gains. While, previously thetransition between active and palliativecare was often sudden, in 2025, becausepatients will be in much greater control oftheir situation, the change in gear will notbe as apparent. More patients will choosewhere they die and the manner of theirdeath. Euthanasia will be legal, but it willnot be a majority choice, because dis-tressing symptoms will be better con-trolled. Indeed a themed death may be arealistic option. In 1900, 90% of peopledied at home. By 1950 the figure had dropped to around 50%. In 2003, only aquarter of cancer patients died at home.In 2025 the percentage of people dying athome will climb again. This will be driv-en by patient choice, better communica-tion between health professionals andincreased domiciliary services. PROFESSIONAL RECONFIGURATION One of the greatest challenges to pro-viding the best cancer care in 2025 willbe having the right people in the rightjobs. Henceforth it will be essential notto continue to train people for jobs thatno longer exist. In 2025 barriersbetween health care professions will bebroken down in order to enable deliveryof the new approaches to cancer care.Intra-professional barriers will di-sappear. The work of pathologists andradiologists will become one as their traditional skills are augmented bythe new generation of diagnostic andtreatment devices.Oncologists will find that many forms ofchemotherapy will be delivered with theaid of the new technology, and surgeonswill be using robots to enable them tooperate. Fewer highly trained specialistswill be required, since much of theirresponsibility will be delegated to spe-cialist technicians and nurses workingto protocols, and mobile technology willenable them to work at a number ofsites on the same day. CONCLUSION In 2025 cancer will become incidentalto day to day life. It will not necessarilybe eradicated but it will not cause thesame anxiety as previously. Patients inall socio-economic groups will be betterinformed and have far greater controlover their medical destinies. Surgeryand chemotherapy will not be rationedon grounds of age since all interventionswill be less damaging psychologically aswell as physically.How true this picture will be willdepend on whether the technologicaladvances outlined in previous sectionsEXPERIENCING CANCER IN 2025 Patient brokers will guide people with cancer through the system Choice will be real and will involve cost decisions Patients will make a contribution to their care costs Complementary therapies will be widely available and well regulated Themed death chosen by patients will be possible 1999100. 80. 60. 40. 20. 0. 2000 2001 2010 sales $64bn, based on a compound annual growth rate of 12%, driven by new technology - particulary biologically targeted therapies earlier intervention patient numbers (ageing population - other diseases controlled)Global Cancer Market by Sector$bn 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015Vaccines Immunostimulants Gene Therapy Supportive Care Novel Approaches Hormonals CytotoxicsCANCER MARKET SET TO TRIPLE BY 2010Grand Round CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 I 19will emerge. The ideal in terms of can- cer care will exist for a minority ofpatients, but the majority may not haveaccess to the full range of services. Oldpeople in 2025, having been relativelypoor all their lives, may suffer from can-cer and a huge range of co-morbiditiesthat will limit their quality of life. Willthere be enough young people to pro-vide the care needed by the old? As withall health issues, the question of accesswill be determined by cost and politicalwill.Conservatively, with patients livinglonger with cancer, rather than dyingfrom it, and with access to new tech-nologies, cancer care costs couldincrease fivefold (from \u00a320,000 perpatient per year in 2003 in the UK to\u00a3100,000) and thus absorb a hefty chunk of a country's health care budget. On the plus side, although the technol-ogy will be expensive, it will be usedmore judiciously, as it will be better tar-geted, and though costs will increase fortreating each individual patient, theoverall costs will decrease becausemore care will be delivered at home. Atthe same time, because people will livelonger the life-time costs of cancer carewill rise along with co-morbidity costs.Politicians will be faced with a realdilemma: if the prevalence of cancerincreases, the cost of delivering carecould be massive. Will cancer care needto be rationed in a draconian way?One dilemma in 2025 will be the polit-ical power of old people. Old peoplewill live longer and will wield consider-able influence. This educated gerontoc- racy will have high expectations and willdemand high standards of care. Will atax-based health system be able to fundtheir expectations? Politicians will haveto consider the alignment betweenpatients' requirements and the wishesof taxpayers and voters, for as the popu-lation ages the percentage of tax-payingvoters will fall. Will the younger tax-payers of 2025 tolerate the expensivewishes of non-taxpayers? The interestsof voters may be very different to theinterests of taxpayers. It seems likely,therefore, that the days of an exclusivelytax-funded health service are num-bered. Co-payments and deductibleswill be an inevitable part of the newfinancial vocabulary.Whatever system is put in place there is the prospect of a major socio-economic division in 2025. A small percentage ofthe elderly population will have madesuitable provision for their retirement,both in terms of health and welfare, butthe vast majority will not be properlyprepared. Policy-makers need to startplanning now. The most productive wayforward is to start involving cancerpatient and health advocacy groups inthe debate, to ensure that difficult deci-sions are reached by consensus.Societal changes will also leave a greaterpercentage of old people alone with nopsychological crutch to lean on at theonset of serious illness, and there willbe a global shortage of carers - theunskilled, low-paid but essential com-ponent of any health delivery system.The richer parts of the world are now harnessing this from the poorer, buteventually the supply of this precioushuman capital will evaporate.New financial structures will emergewith novel consortia from the pharma-ceutical, financial and healthcare sec-tors, enabling people to buy into thelevel of care they wish to pay for.Hospitals will become attractive healthhotels run by competing private sectorproviders and global franchises will pro-vide speciality therapies through thesestructures.Governments will have long ceased todeliver care. In Britain the NHS, one ofthe last centralised systems to disap-pear, will convert to UK Health - aregulator and safety net insurer -already by 2012. The ability of technology to improve cancer care is assured. But this willcome at a price - the direct costs of pro-viding it and the costs of looking afterthe increasingly elderly population thatwill result.We will eventually simply run out ofthings to die from.New ethical and moral dilemmas willarise as we seek the holy grail of com-pressed morbidity. Living long anddying fast will become the mantra of21st century medicine. Our cancerfuture will emerge from the interactionof four factors: the success of new tech-nology, society's willingness to pay,future healthcare delivery systems andthe financial mechanisms that under-pin them.

Seriousadverse events have been the exceptionin the clinical trials of experimental vac-cines conducted to date. At the sametime, there have been few glimpses ofreal benefit, with numerous false dawnsand much disappointment.But there was an explosion of interest inthis field after the unravelling of mech-anisms for triggering cytotoxic T-cell(CTL) response about 15 years ago. It was a fundamental breakthrough inimmunology that provided insights intothe workings of the immune system andhow to activate and direct it to attackcancers. Moreover, our knowledge ofhow cancers, in turn, deploy defencemechanisms to evade or disable theimmune system has also increased.Cancer vaccines can be divided intothree categories. The first group, non-specific immunostimulants, covers theagents BCG, interleukin-2 and interfer-on alpha, which are used to treat blad-der cancer, renal cell carcinoma andmalignant melanoma. They boost levelsof activity in the immune system toreverse immunosuppression induced bythe tumour, resulting in rejection of thecancer. Although many agents havebeen tested, few have been successfuland these failures have tarnished theentire field.Specific-target vaccines are based onthe antigens expressed by tumours by normal tissues. ous variants: subunit and anti-idiotypevaccines and immuno-gene therapy toname three. Much effort has beendirected toward high-tech solutions inthis area, but it has become apparentthat tumours continue to mutate as thedisease progresses, evading the immunesystem by downregulating or losing theexpression of the target antigen.The third group, multivalent and ultra-valent vaccines, combine several anti-gens in one formulation to overcomeimmunological evasion. This is akin tocombination chemotherapies, wherebyresistance to one element is mitigatedby the presence of others. Taking thisconcept still further, a number of vac-cines use inactivated whole cancer cellsbecause they contain the entire spec-trum of tumour antigens in an ultrava-lent formulation. CELL VACCINES The most encouraging results so farhave come from cell vaccines. Thesehave moved the state of the art beyondsafety and immunogenicity into therealm of clear clinical benefit. Indeed,in 70 recently published vaccine trials,half used cell therapies (late-stage clini-cal highlights are shown in the box).Broadly speaking, there types ofcell cells, pro-cessing them ex vivo to induce immuno-Using vaccines that stimulate theimmune system to fight cancerappeals to many as a natural approach that is both safe and effective.And, judging from a recent headline in the UK newspaper The Times - \"Vaccine jab could cure lung cancer\" -there is clear public interest in this area.Even big pharma is showing signs ofexcitement. At a partnering conferenceone of the more traditional majors saidcancer vaccines had moved from the 'nostrategic interest' category to 'watchfulwaiting' - an almost seismic shift tothose of us who remember past scepti-cism. But is there promise beyond thehype? And can vaccines find a place inmodern cancer therapy?The immune system has always playedan important role in cancer prevention.Pre-malignancies, induced by toxicchemicals, excessive exposure to UVradiation, viral infection or simplyspontaneous genetic mutations, ariseat intervals throughout the body. Theyare generally detected and destroyedby a panoply of immune mechanisms,mostly before we are aware that any-thing untoward has happened. On rareoccasions, this occurs after the clinicalmanifestation of cancer, resulting inspontaneous regressions. Vaccinetreatment aims to harness these mech-anisms in a therapeutic setting.The prospect of avoiding the severeside-effects associated with many treat-ments underpins the demand for can-cer vaccines. Despite recurrent vaccineAnthony Walker* There have been many false dawns in the field of cancer vaccines, but some of the new products look distinctly promising.DrugWatch CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 I 21logical activity and then returning them to the donor. Companies using auto-logous tumour cells autolo-gous cell vaccines have significantmerit, matching the tumour antigensprecisely to the patient being treated.They have also produced favourableresults in trials of several cancers. Butinterest in this approach has wanedbecause of inherent logistical difficul-ties and the associated high costs.The other autologous technology employspatients' immune cells. Dendreon, IDMfrom California,use dendritic cells whereas Targeted Genetics, both of Seattle,Washington, use T-cells. Again, thisapproach is scientifically and medicallysound, but doubts remain as to whetherthe treatments can be applied acrossbroad patient populations.Allogeneic cell vaccines rely on the can-cer antigens present in a high percent-age of tumour spec-trum of tumour-specific and tumour-associated antigens (TSAs and TAAsrespectively) will be unique to a tumourdeposit, some cell lines express tens ifnot hundreds of common antigens athigh frequency. When immortalised,these cell lines can be used in vaccines.They grow indefinitely in culture sys-tems and can be manufactured at indus-trial scale in modern cGMP facilities.Another advantage of allogeneic cellvaccines is that the concept behindthem - they are a product in a bottlerather than a bespoke service - is famil-iar to the pharma industry. Furthermore,the costs are lower from economies ofscale and, importantly, they are readilyavailable (there are no lengthy leadtimes as there may be with certain autologous systems). The leading proponent of this approachis Dr Donald Morton, founder ofCancerVax and a pioneer in clinicalcancer immunotherapy for more thanfour decades. CancerVax's lead product,Canvaxin, is composed of three humanmelanoma cell lines rendered replica-tion-incompetent through irradiation,with BCG used as a vaccine adjuvantfor the initial two doses. Canvaxin,which is currently in two internationalrandomised Phase III trials in malig-nant melanoma, has arguably producedbetter safety and clinical efficacy datathan those supporting the approval ofseveral new cancer therapies.Other companies active in this areainclude Cell Genesys (which also hasautologous-vaccine programmes) andLondon-based Onyvax, whose leadproduct for prostate cancer, Onyvax-P,is in Phase II trials, data from which willbe reported later this year. NEXT STEPS The field of cancer vaccines hasmatured considerably over the past fewyears. Several products are in Phase IIItrials with the prospect of potentialproduct registrations over the next 18 to24 months. If all goes to plan, vaccinescould be available to patients in 2006 or2007.Although significant challenges andrisks remain - as they will until the firstcancer vaccine is registered - thesehave shifted away from the early proof-of-concept issues towards the practicalrealities of manufacturing and regula-tory affairs.This, together with compelling datafrom late-stage trials, is convincing thesector that cancer vaccines representmuch more than hype. *Anthony Walker is CEO of Onyvax, a London- based biotechnology company which develops novelcancer therapies that harness the body's immunesystem.

The renal-cell carcinoma vaccine was tested in a 55-centre, 558- patient trial. At 70 months, progression-free survival rates were 72% in the vaccine groupand 59.3% in the control group. The product was well tolerated, with only 12 adverse eventsassociated with the treatment.Canvaxin (CancerVax) . In a sample of 263 patients who underwent complete resection of clinically detectable stage IV melanoma, 150 people received post-surgical treatment withCanvaxin in Phase II protocols and 113 received other or no adjuvant therapy. Median over-all survival and five-year overall survival were significantly increased in patients who receivedthe treatment vaccine compared with those who didn't (36 compared with 18 months, and39% compared with 19%).Provenge (Dendreon) . In a randomised Phase II/III trial in hormone refractory prostate can- cer, patients receiving Provenge had a significant survival advantage, with an 89% averageoverall increase in survival time compared with the placebo group. Median survival time inthe treatment group was 30.1 months compared with 22.3 months among people who werenot treated. At 30 months from randomisation, the survival rate for Provenge-treated patientswas 3.7 times higher than for those receiving placebo.Regulatory Digest 22I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004Kathy RedmondNew law boosts EMEA role OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS a number of cancer drugs have received EU marketing Faslodex (pemetrexed), indicated for the treat- ment of malignant pleural mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer, has received a positive opinion from the CHMP.

One of these is MabThera (rituximab), which can now be used in previously untreated patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in combination with CVP(cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone)chemotherapy. The other is Herceptin (trastuzumab),which is now indicated for use in combination withdocetaxel for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have not receivedprior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

I I I PHARMION CORPORATION has withdrawn its European marketing authorisation application for thalidomide forthe treatment of multiple myeloma, and will now focus onpreparing a new dossier containing the additional clinicaldata requested by EMEA. Thalidomide will continue tobe available in Europe on a compassionate use basis. Theagent is already approved in Australia, New Zealand andTurkey for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiplemyeloma.The new European pharmaceutical legislationcame into force on 20 May. Its effect is toconsiderably enhance the role of the European Medicines Agency (formerly the EuropeanMedicines Evaluation Agency - it retains its acronym'EMEA') in a number of areas. These include theprovision of scientific advice to companies; givingopinions - in co-operation with the World HealthOrganization - on the use of medicines outside theEuropean Union; and giving opinions on the compas-sionate use of unapproved medicines in MemberStates.Under provisions which are due to be implementedin November 2005, EMEA will also take on a role inconditional approvals and fast-track reviews, and thescope of the centralised approval procedure will beextended in such a way that it covers all cancerdrugs. The Agency was also given a stronger role in the provi-sion of information to patients and the public, includinga mandate to develop a database of all medicinesapproved in the European Union ('EuroPharm'). Small-and medium-sized companies should benefit fromprovisions in the legislation enabling EMEA to offerthem administrative and scientific support. Other changes brought about by the legislation include: The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use replaces the Committee for ProprietaryMedicinal Products. The new Committee will beknown as the CHMP. A new Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products is created and is expected to begin activity later in2004. The composition of the Management Board changes from two to one member per MemberState, in addition to two representatives each of theEuropean Parliament and the EuropeanCommission. They are joined by two representativesof patient organisations, one representative ofdoctors' organisations and one representative of veterinarians' organisations.24I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004InsideTrack Secrets of success In the world of oncology drugs, Roche is one of the giants. Here, Chief Executive Franz Humer talks about the research and business strategies behind his company's success, and about noveltherapies in the pipeline that could help alleviate patients' experience of cancer. He also speaksof his mission to save Europe from relegation in the field of medical research. Austrian-born Franz B. Humer, Chairman and Chief Executive ofRoche, has good reason to be happy.His company, based in Basel, is aworld leader in cancer drugs and diagnostics, and he believes it holds one of themost exciting drug pipelines in the industry.Roche's success story is the outcome of shrewdstrategic choices initiated in the late 1980s. \"It isvery important to see how science has developedin the last 10 years,\" says Humer. \"The unravel-ling of the human genome has allowed biomed-ical research to make quantum leaps in oncologyand because Roche was at the forefront ofresearch, it was able to apply the new knowledgefaster than others.\"Several factors explain Roche's success. Very earlyon it decided to tackle the field of oncology fromtwo angles: small molecules (chemicalcompounds) and large molecules (proteins andmonoclonal antibodies). Then it made importantacquisitions or took majority participations thatboosted its research and development and turnedit into the second largest biotechnology companyInterview by Rapha\u00ebl Brenner in the world. The acquisitions were: Genentechin 1990, Boehringer-Mannheim in 1998 and theJapanese company Chugai in 2001. Says Humer,\"Our alliance with Genentech probably repre-sents our most successful move in America, and I am sure that, with time, we will see that ouracquisition of Chugai will be as successful for usin Japan as Genentech was for Roche in the US.On its side, Boehringer-Mannheim reinforcedour know-how of oncology diagnostics and was akey factor in acquiring access to the knowledgebase of tumour markers.\" BIOTECHNOLOGY THE PILLAR OF GROWTHThe combination of diagnostics and pharmaceuti-cals in oncology has secured Roche a powerfulposition in this field. \"As far as I know, ourapproach is unique,\" says Humer. \"In our researchcentre in Germany, diagnostics and pharmaceu-tical research in oncology are located in the samebuilding, in order to strengthen collaborationbetween the two.\" This approach has resulted in arich harvest of drugs for Roche. Indeed, thecompany's revenue growth has been driven by its oncology division, whose 2003 sales rose 30% andaccounted for a staggering 31% of its pharmaceu-tical sales.This year may well turn out to be a watershed yearfor Roche's oncology division. In Spring 2004, aphase III study of MabThera (rituximab), a mono-clonal antibody, reached its primary endpoints ofresponse rate and progression-free survival twoyears early in the relapsed indolent form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In February 2004, the FDAapproved Avastin (bevacizumab), the first angio-genesis inhibitor for the treatment of colorectalcancer. Most recently, at the meeting of the Amer-ican Society of Clinical Oncology in June, Rocheunveiled encouraging results of clinical trials intotwo of its products: Tarceva (erlotinib), an EGFRinhibitor for use in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have progressed afterstandard chemotherapy, and Xeloda (capecitabine) an oral form of chemotherapy used in the treat-ment of colorectal cancer.The strength of Roche's in-house R&D isreflected in 119 research projects and 61 newmolecular entities - nineteen of which are inoncology and focus on solid tumours and bonemetastases. It is therefore no surprise thatoncology is Roche's most important R&D field,and that it absorbs close to 20% of all investmentsinto the various therapeutic areas of Roche'sPharma division.Humer is pleased with the success of Avastin,which he says has enjoyed a very rapid and stronguptake in the US. Roche has now filed forapproval in Europe, which it hopes will beaccorded by the end of the year, after which it willlaunch a large number of trials in several countries. Roche and Genentech have alreadyInsideTrack I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 25 \"One should never forget that injecting is a dreadful act - it makes a patient sick\"26I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004InsideTrack with patient organisations.\" Together with Genentech, Roche is now trying to develop anorally active compound against the HER-2 target. RELATING TO PATIENTS Humer believes his personal experience of canceralongside his wife has given him some insight intothe needs of cancer patients. \"The loneliness ofcancer patients is not sufficiently understood,\" hestresses. Humer wants to see closer co-operationbetween patient organisations and the pharmaceu-tical industry, but notes: \"this relationship has to be carefully structured andnurtured. It must not be amere commercial relation-ship. Nor would I advocatethe involvement of patientorganisations in the develop-ment process, because thisis driven by scientific dataand regulatory require-ments. On the other hand,in later stages of the devel-opment process, that is, inphases IIIb and IV, we areinvolving patients to a greatdegree and this is proving very fruitful. I favour seeing Europe move closer tothe US in enabling greater access to patients.\"As a step in this direction, he has appointed a go-between to enhance contacts with cancer patientorganisations at the international level, withfurther staff responsible for liaising with cancerpatient organisations in each of the majormarkets.Humer is convinced that patient organisationswill play an increasingly pivotal role, particularlyin funding issues: \"Governments won't be able todo everything and will need help in setting prior-ities. This is where patient organisations will havesubstantial influence.\" STEMMING THE DECLINE INEUROPEAN RESEARCH As the new President of the European Federationof Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations(EFPIA), Humer has set himself the mission ofhelping to resolve Europe's research crisis. In thelast 12 years, the European pharmaceuticalinitiated an extensive further development programme for Avastin in order to test the drug incombination with other treatments and also tosee how it works in additional indications. \"Wewant to assess as quickly as possible where elsethis drug can be useful,\" says Humer.With such assets, Humer sees no interest in anyfuture merger, particularly with Novartis, itscross-town rival, which is also active in oncology:\"We are not anti-Novartis. We simply opposemergers in general. A merger does not make goodindustrial sense and would harm our capability toinnovate. Mergers destroyteams, knowledge andresearch continuity.\" FROMIV TO ORAL DRUGS Humer ranks the developmentof oral forms of chemotherapyfor cancer patients as one ofRoche's most significantachievements. Having lost hiswife to breast cancer after athree-year struggle, he has apersonal understanding of theplight of cancer patients. \"I went through all the hopesand despairs one can imagine. I used to inject mywife with chemotherapy and, believe me, it was anightmare. One should never forget that injectingis a dreadful act - it makes a patient sick, not tomention the fact of feeling even sicker because ofbeing immobilised the way cancertreatment is experienced.\"For the possibilities of oral drugs to be fullyrealised, however, Humer believes a change inthe economic incentives for hospitals and physi-cians is needed. \"In many countries, the rules ofthe game today in terms of financial incentivesare such that if doctors or hospitals can choosebetween making more money on an injectabledrug or prescribing an oral cancer drug, theychoose the injectable one - even if the oral formis available. The incentive system needs to berestructured. We fought a two-year battle in theUS to put Xeloda on equal footing with IVs interms of reimbursement. The need is there andthis is an example of an area where we can work industry has forfeited its place to the US as the world leader in sales and research. While, just adecade ago, European pharmaceutical companiesinvested 70% of their R&D budgets in Europe,this figure has now fallen to 50% and is expectedto continue falling. Among other factors, Humerattributes the change to the faster access tomarkets and patients enjoyed by US companies.He believes the key to resolving the crisis lieswith the recommendations of the G-10 group,established by the European Commission andmade up of health and trade representatives,pharmaceutical and generic industries andpatient groups.The crucial issue is whether individual MemberStates will have the political will to implementthe recommendations. Warns Humer: \"If wedon't turn this around, Europe will not have aproductive pharmaceutical industry in the future,and this will be a tragedy.\" The new drug legisla-tion recently passed by the European Parliamentis, he notes, a step in the right direction and will accelerate the approval process: \"This is particu-larly important in oncology, where patients oftenface access delays for innovative drugs. For ourpart, we intend to tackle access delays by puttingcancer drugs on the market as soon as theyreceive approval, at a price fixed by us, and onlyafterwards begin negotiating the reimbursementprice with the regulatory agencies of eachcountry.\"On the down side, Humer raises the alarmregarding the pharma legislation andclinical directives: \"This adds anotherunnecessary layer of requirements. Large compa-nies will be able to absorb this, but it will have anegative impact on smaller companies and onhospitals and research institutes.This is the reason why the G-10 is just the begin-ning of our struggle. We need to change the situ-ation dramatically if we wish to restore Europe'sattractiveness.\"InsideTrack I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 27 \"We need to change the situation dramatically if we wish to restore Europe's attractiveness\"28I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004Master piece Bob Pinedo: Bringing two worlds together At the tender age of 29, Dr Pinedo found himself in charge of a group of cancer patients who were being left to die, and he set out to find a way to treat them. What followed was a remark-able story of one man and his lab, whose pioneering work brought new hope to a generation ofpatients and helped set the standards for translational research. Your involvement with cancer started at a time when medical oncology was noteven recognised as a specialist area ofmedicine and all the action was takingplace in the US. What prompted yourinterest?B OBPINEDO It all started when, fresh out of medical school, I arrived in Utrecht to take thepost of Chief Registrar in Internal Medicine. I was struck by the fact that some cancer patientswere left lying on the ward, neglected and lackingtreatment. They were simply dying. I was 29 atthe time. I had completed my training in internalmedicine in Leiden, and had just defended mythesis on hypertension. When I arrived inUtrecht, hypertension was well taken care of butcancer patients were completely neglected, so I decided to forget about hypertension, andconcentrate on cancer. What did you do? B OBPINEDO One of the first things I did was to create a division of Medical Oncology - the firstin the country and one of the first in Europe.Interview by Anna Wagstaff Then I signed up for some of the general oncologycourses run by the UICC [International UnionAgainst Cancer]. In those days, GianniBonadonna had just started his adriamycin trialsin Milan, and I introduced the drug to treat breastcancer patients in Holland. My colleagues wereall highly critical. They said: \"This is a terribledrug; you will give your patients heart failure.\" SoI put my patients on a heart monitor. It seemsridiculous now, but at the time it was needed tostem the criticism and enable me to continuetreatment with the drug.By 1974, I knew I needed more training anddecided to go to the US. So at the World CancerCongress in Florence that year, I searched outPaul Carbone - who was very influential withinthe National Cancer Institute [NCI] - and askedif I could come over. He agreed, but when I arrived at the NCI, I was told he had just left,and true enough, his luggage was standing in thecorridor. So there I was, a young man, who hadcome to train but had no sponsor. The staff,however, were very nice and told me: \"You can dowhatever you want - go ahead.\" So I did. Master piece I was intrigued by methotrexate at the time, so I went to see Bruce Chabner, chief of the Pharmacology section, who was particularlyknown at that time for his work on this new drug. I explained that I wanted to study the pharma-cology of methotrexate in mice, and he said \"OK\".Along the same corridor I found a basic pharma-cologist, Dr Zaharko, who agreed to let me do theresearch in his lab. He told me about a companythat had started making infusion systems thatcould administer drugs under the skin of mice,and suggested I write a protocol. I proceeded todo it and it won his approval. Then I had to do thepharmacology. So I went back to Chabner's laband asked the assistant technician there to showme how to measure mouse methotrexate levels. Ibegan the research and it proved a big success.But I also needed to study the effects on bonemarrow stem cells, so I set out to find a lab wherethey had bone marrow stem cells I could use toculture my mouse marrow. I found Dr Joan Bull, Two years later, my critics all started using the drug themselveswho had previously been working with Carbone, and she said: \"Fine, go ahead.\" This was what wasso nice there. Though the person who hadbrought me to the NCI had left, everyone waseager to give me a chance. Eighteen months laterI had already five papers published in Cancer Research and other leading US journals on the effects of methotrexate on the bone marrow ofmice. That, for me, was the real scientific start. How did you use the knowledge you gained at the NCI to improve thetreatment of your patients back inUtrecht?B OBPINEDO Apart from my contribution towards researching methotrexate, I learned at the NCIabout how the skills of a basic scientist could becombined with my training as a clinician to betterunderstand what effect a particular dosage of aparticular drug and metabolism has on aparticular patient. I was determined to set up a With Bruce Chabner. \"Pinedo and Chabner\" became known to generations of oncology studentsthrough the Cancer Chemotherapy annuals they edited for many years. The two of them became lifelong friendsduring Pinedo's days at the NCI, whereChabner was Chief of Pharmacology30I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004lab when I returned to Utrecht, and combining the worlds of scientist and clinician has been myapproach to patient care ever since.Shortly before I left the US, in 1976, Chabner toldme of an experimental pharmacologist named AlLeyva who had just applied for a job at the NCI. SoI called him and said: \"Al, can you help me? I am aclinician and I want to set up a lab.\" He agreed tohelp, and a few weeks later we set up the lab at thehospital in Utrecht, and started doing pharma-cology in patients, beginning with high-dosemethotrexate for osteosarcomas. We created quitea stir and came in for a lot of criticism. Was there no regulation limiting your freedom to experiment in this way?B OBPINEDO No. One could just go ahead. For instance, we didn't have the money to pay for themethotrexate we needed, so I asked Al to purify itfrom the patient's urine, because almost 90% ofthis expensive drug is excreted in the urine. So wepurified it and gave it back to the patient. Thisworked fine. I still see one of those early patients.After that, we started trying out platinum ontesticular cancer. I knew that Larry Einhorn,whom I had met in the States, had achievedterrific results with platinum, but the drug hadnever been used in Europe. So when a colleagueof mine developed testicular cancer we agreed I should pick up some platinum on my next tripto the US, which I did and brought it back in mypocket.Then I began receiving phone calls from oncolo-gists in our Cancer Institute: \"Are you crazy touse platinum? You will make these patientshorribly sick.\" It was true. My patient was verysick. He was the first patient in the Netherlands- probably the first in Europe - to be givenplatinum, and we were still learning how to usethe drug properly. But he survived, and his meta-stasis disappeared. And he still visits me everyyear. Two years later, my critics started using thedrug themselves. This is how I had to do things, because if I'd done it in another way, it wouldhave taken years. After that first patient, we drew up a protocol fora proper trial of platinum in testicular cancer, andthen went out to many hospitals and presentedour first ten cases. We explained that we wantedto learn how to use the drug, and people wereimpressed and started referring patients to us. Afew years later, I and Dr Stoter (who was amember of my staff, and is now professor in theRotterdam Cancer Institute), published animportant paper in the Lancet showing very good results. We then moved on to using a platinumregimen in ovarian cancer, and again weconducted a large study in Holland, known as theDutch Ovarian Cancer Group. This was within acouple of years of returning from the NCI, andthere were still only four of us doing this work. You achieved all this by the age of 35 with very little money and no co-operation from those around you.How do you account for the fact thattoday we see such slow progress frommillion-dollar research efforts and hugemulti-centre collaborations that wereunimaginable in your early days?B OBPINEDO It's not the money that determines the result, it's the method. Let us not forget thatwhile the big research money and major trials areconcentrated in the US, most cancer drugs comefrom Europe, because European chemists aregood. Adriamycin came from Italy, carboplatinfrom the UK, VP16 from Switzerland, oxaliplatinfrom France, cyclophosphamide from Germany,and now CPT 11 for colon cancer, also fromFrance. The US has the system and the money.They are good at taking a European drug anddoing big trials.When it comes to translational research, thenumber of participating centres should be limited.Master piece Most of the cancer drugs came from Europe, because the European chemists are goodI CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 31Master piece Take adriamycin. It was developed here in Europe by Gianni Bonadonna at his owninstitute. He said: I don't want to involve theEORTC [European Organisation for Researchand Treatment of Cancer], I have enoughpatients in my institute. And it was a hit.Translational research makes use of the tissues andblood of your patients to understand the biology inthe patient, the pharmacology, and pharmaco-dynamics. This involves not only measuring thedrugs, but measuring the effects of the drugs onorgans. It is meticulous work and the mostimportant thing is to achieve complete standard-isation of the processing of the tissue and closeobservation of the patient. This is much harder toachieve when several centres are involved.In my view, the European Community ismaking a mistake in always seeking collabo-ration between many groups - eight or twelve centres in four or five countries. That is goodfor trials, and it may be good for basic scientists,but for trans lational research, 4 X2 is better than 1X8. So please, European Community, accept small groups. We can each do an excellent job inour area, and have standard tissue processing. Translational research is strongly promoted by large sections of the cancerworld today, but how much is it actuallytaught to trainee clinicians and basicscientists?B OBPINEDO When I joined the Free University, Amsterdam, in 1979, as Professor of MedicalOncology and Head of the newly createdDepartment of Medical Oncology, I made it mypriority to teach my students the philosophy of With Frits Duparc, Director of theyoung doctors on thecourse about howpatients feel aboutdiscussing theirdisease If we don't think about the pharmacology of drugs we can cause a lot of harm to our patients32I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004Master piece translational research and the importance of bringing the worlds of scientists and clinicianstogether. Unfortunately, this is not generally thecase elsewhere. We held regular clinical researchseminars attended by basic scientists, where thepresentation was oriented towards patients, notscience. And we held basic science seminarsattended by clinicians, which were orientedtowards basic science. Basic scientists wereencouraged to come with clinical proposals, makesuggestions, and ask the clinicians all sorts ofstupid questions. And clinicians were encouragedto feel free to ask the basic scientists stupidquestions of their own. This broke the ice. I also insisted that the clinicians pursue a labproject, and that the basic scientists spend oneweek in the clinic, on the unit, with the nurses,residents and interns. Can you imagine a chemistor a biologist involved in a phase I trial sitting andlistening to clinicians explaining the propositionto patients, talking through the patients' concernsand maybe hearing patients explain why theydon't want to participate? Initially I met with a lot of resistance. It's strangefor a biologist to sit and drink coffee with nursesand listen to them discussing the problems of thisor that patient. But just sitting in that coffee roomfor half an hour and listening to what the nursesare saying is crucial. At the simplest level, it helpsthem understand why the piece of tissue theyneed to examine arrives at 5.30 in the evening,and not at 8.00 in the morning, because thesurgeons who have to take that biopsy for theprotocol for the translational research won't do itin their routine programme. They will do it at theend of their programme, at around 3.00 or 4.00 inthe afternoon. That is why you may have to stayan hour or two longer in the lab to process thetissue. And if you have been in that environmentfor a week, you understand this, and you feelmore motivated because you see the two worldscoming together.I also think it's very important for medical oncolo- gists to know internal medicine and understandthe pharmacology of the drugs they prescribe. Theproblems of our patients affect all organ systems -we have to deal with cardiac toxicity, renal toxicityand so on. Many of our patients will havecomorbid conditions and will need other drugs aswell, and the functions of their organs are oftenabnormal. Medical oncologists need to ask thequestion: \"What is happening with the painkiller I prescribed if the liver is not functioning well?\" If we don't think about the pharmacology of drugswe can cause a lot of harm to our patients. This isnot taught enough in medical schools. Breaking down barriers between the world of the patient and the world of theclinician is something that is also veryimportant to you.B OBPINEDO I can tell my patients everything and they can tell me everything. A newly-diagnosedmay tell me she wants to postpone the start of hertreatment. So we sit down and talk frankly aboutthe risks of waiting, say, until after her holiday.All drugs are very important, but half of thework is how you approach your patient, and I'mconvinced that an empathic approach helpsthem live longer. I have a patient with a tumouron her liver, who enjoys biking. Every time I palpate that big protruding liver, I know shewill be watching the expression on my face. Ican either grimace, and utter - \"Oh God!\" - orI can ask her: \"How far have you biked today?\"And we will talk about the good things in herlife. This is the secret of homeopaths. Theymake use of the shortage of doctors, and taketime with their patients - time that we don'thave. The patients are happy and I believe livelonger as a result. This particular patient hasbeen biking around with a huge liver for fouryears, after having been told she would die inthree months.But just sitting in that coffee room and listening to what the nurses are saying is crucialStart talking more about surviving with cancer and not only stressing the cure I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 33Master piece How do you teach this approach to your students?B OBPINEDO By doing rounds. On teaching rounds, the students follow you around and theysee how you talk with your patients and how youtouch your patients. Touching your patients is nottaught in medical schools, but most patients liketo be touched if you are talking to them. Notnecessarily Spanish-style, when you kiss yourpatients on both cheeks - though I do haveSpanish patients, and I am happy to greet them inthis way. I also have many patients from Curacao,which is where I come from, and when I seethem on my rounds I will say two or three wordsin Papiamentu. None of my students understand,but the patients are delighted. You need to find aconnection.I also teach Masterclass courses for the EuropeanSchool of Oncology, where I have the chance totalk to medical oncologists from all over Europe,including many countries where there is verylittle tradition of openness with patients. I recently invited three of my patients toaccompany me on one of these courses so thedoctors at the Masterclass could see how I talk tothem, and how they talk to me. I wanted to letthem speak - to say how they feel aboutdiscussing their cancer, what they feel aboutphase I trials, or what they feel about anything.They did a wonderful job. They could see some ofthe doctors were afraid to ask questions, so one ofmy patients said: \"Listen, I want you to ask meanything that comes to mind. I can talk about it,I know I am going to die.\"Many of the doctors were shocked and didn'tknow how to respond. If we keep doing this,particularly at international courses, I believe wewill get the message across. Where do you see progress in the fight against cancer being made?B OBPINEDO I think targeted agents will be very important, and a much better multidisciplinaryapproach. We need to start talking more about surviving with cancer and not only stressing thecure. Many people are failing to recognise howmuch longer our patients are living now thanthey did 25 years ago. Instead of three months,they live eight years. I am convinced that cancerwill become a chronic disease, as long as wehave enough doctors and enough time for ourown patients. We need to start getting peopleaccustomed to this.Some of my patients are reluctant to go to workbecause people tell them they \"stink ofchemotherapy\" - this can be a terrible blow to aperson who is fighting cancer. Businesses mustlearn to accept the fact that they have four orfive cancer patients in their office, and thewhole social system should be more accommo-dating to patients living with cancer. We shouldstop talking just in terms of a cure rate, becausethe time is coming when these targeting agents,even if they don't eliminate cancer, will keep itunder control and society will have to make thenecessary adjustments. The human touchSpotlight on... I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 35EBCC: Driving up standards in breast care The European Breast Cancer Conference set up by researchers, clinicians and advocates who wanted to co-ordinate their work and widen the fight against cancer to include the publicand politicians. This year it took place under the shadow of the Clinical Trials Directive. In 1998, three of Europe's leading organ- isations representing researchers, clinicians and women cancer advocates launched thebiennial European Breast CancerConference (EBCC) to co-ordinate breast cancer research, educate primary care providersabout breast cancer and sensitise politicians andwomen to the potential for progress.These conferences are unusual in that they bringtogether, on an equal footing, researchers, clinicalpractitioners and women activists, and are orientedas much towards the public and politicians astowards professionals. Each EBCC issues a closingstatement, which makes demands on national politi-cians, the EU and on clinicians and researchers.They press for measures to improve the legalframework for research and treatment, the inter-change between research and clinical practice andthe management of services. They push ethicalissues up the agenda, and introduce the patientview into debates. The statements emanating from the biennial con-ferences carry great weight because of the author-ity of its three organising bodies: The Breast Cancer Co-operative Group of theEuropean Organisation for Research andPeter McIntyre Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) - an importantdriver of laboratory and clinical research inEurope. EUSOMA (the European Society of Mastology)- the organisation that sets standards in the man-agement of breast diseases, and helps cliniciansand centres to meet the standards to become spe-cialist breast units. Europa Donna - the coalition of breast cancergroups throughout Europe that represents the con-cerns and interests of women. Both EORTC and EUSOMA promotetranslational research, seeking to move laboratorydiscoveries quickly into clinical trials and tominimise the delay between the development ofeffective anti-cancer therapies and their use inpatient treatment.Europa Donna has proved a powerful lobby, press-ing authorities and governments for improvements.It played a key role in securing a strong resolutionin the European Parliament, in June 2003, aimedat reducing cancer mortality by 25% across Europe- the first policy ever passed by that body on a spe-cific disease. The EBCC formula emerged from lengthy discus-sions in the early 1990s around the possibility ofSpotlight on... 36I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004extending the former EORTC Breast Cancer Working Conference.The plans were finalised in June 1995, at a meet-ing hosted by Umberto Veronesi and attended byrepresentatives of the three organising groups andthe Federation of European Cancer Societies. Itwas a success from the first and has since grown insize and diversity. In 1998, Florence attracted morethan 3,000 delegates from 74 countries. Thefourth EBCC in Hamburg this year welcomed3,599 delegates from 82 countries. FOCUS ON OPTIMAL CARE Florence focused on the quality of treatment,demanding that all women should have access tomultidisciplinary and multi-professional breastclinics. It also drew attention to the need forresearch to feed more quickly into clinical trialsand treatments. By the time of the second EBCCin Brussels in 2000, the three societies had agreedguidelines defining the requirements for thesededicated breast units. The Brussels Statementcalled for all breast units to develop quality assur-ance programmes and to contribute to a commonEuropean database. It also called for mammogramscreening to be implemented throughout Europefor women aged between 50 and 75, free at thepoint of delivery. The statement expressed earlyconcerns about the future of European research projects. The Brussels Statement called forinformed consent to be routinely obtained from allbreast cancer patients for the use of frozen tumourspecimens. However, the EU, driven in part bypublic disquiet about medical abuses, was pursu-ing a different agenda. RESEARCH CONCERNS TOP THE AGENDA Fast forward two years to Barcelona in 2002, andthe third EBCC recognised \"pan-European con-cern about the future of clinical and translationalresearch for cancer in general and breast cancerin particular\". The conference was presentedwith data about the steep increase in age-specificmortality from breast cancer between the war andthe mid 1980s, followed by a significant fall inmortality between 1987 and 2000.There was a consensus that around two-thirds ofthe reduction in breast cancer mortality could beattributed to improvements in treatment sincethe first trials of tamoxifen in older women andcytotoxic chemotherapy for pre-menopausalwomen.The Barcelona Statement feared that Europeanmulti-centre trials, which were largely responsiblefor continuous incremental improvements in treat-ment, were under threat by \"well meaning, but Since its founding conferencein Florence, 1998,the gonefrom more than 3500 delegates from 82 countriesSpotlight on... I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 37misguided, bureaucratic challenges\". Indeed, what the EU called 'good clinical practice' as applied toclinical trials, patient confidentiality and ethicalissues would make trials difficult to conduct andprohibitively expensive. Ethics Committees were tightening their interpre-tation of the Helsinki Declaration on ethicalresearch to the point of threatening the recruit-ment of patients into trials. The statement said thatunless Ethics Committees encouraged cancerresearch they would become obstacles to progress,\"carrying equal responsibility for unnecessary lossof life in the future, as those clinical scientists whohave abused the trust of the public in the past\".And so to the fourth conference in Hamburg inMarch this year, barely a month before theEuropean Directive on Clinical Trials came intoforce. The Hamburg Statement - published in fullon these pages - issued a clear warning:\"Excessively rigid legislation, unjustifiable adminis-trative restrictions and government budget cuts arethreatening cancer research in general, and breastcancer research in particular.\" The EU directivewas said to be especially damaging to research intosurgery, imaging, radiation therapy and tailoringtreatments. There were calls for action. Karin J\u00f6ns, theEuropean Parliament's standing rapporteur forbreast cancer, who is herself a breast cancer sur-vivor and President of the German Forum of Europa Donna, criticised the fact that only eightEuropean countries currently offer nationwidemammography screening, and many of these arenot in line with EU guidelines. The need for screening was underlined by a con-troversy over self-examination. Professor LarsHolmberg, from the Uppsala Regional OncologicCentre, Sweden, said that self-examination raisedanxiety levels to no good effect and could be posi-tively harmful. He based his remarks on a Russian study, whichfound that women were reporting more benignlesions to their doctors without any reduction incancer deaths. FOCUS ON AGE Age-related issues were a recurring theme. TheInstitut Gustave Roussy in Villejuif, France, report-ed that women who carry the highly aggressiveBRCA breast cancer gene are at no greater risk ofrelapse after treatment. The gene is associatedwith cancer in young women, who are prone torecurrence. However, the risk factor appears to beage, rather than genetics. Dr Suzette Delaloge, assistant professor at theInstitut, called for more research into why youngerwomen relapse. Y ounger women who survive breast cancer can suffer long-term physical and psychologi- The 4th EBCC, in Hamburg,was chaired by 2004cal after-effects. Dr Lonneke van de Poll-Franse from the Comprehensive Cancer Centre South inEindhoven, in The Netherlands, said that 22% ofyounger women were having problems with unusualtiredness even ten years later, compared with only 4%of older women. In general, follow-up care is not reassuring. IngridK\u00f6ssler, President of the Swedish Association ofBreast Cancer Societies, reported on a question-naire returned by 600 women following treatmentfor breast cancer, which revealed that follow-upexaminations were often hurried, with no opportu-nity to ask questions, express emotional concernsor talk about a woman's social situation.She called for research into follow-up by specialistnurses.It is not only young women who need special attention, but also the elderly. Professor Holmberg said that doctors were not trying hard enough tofind suitable treatments for women aged 75 orolder, who make up a quarter of breast cancerpatients and who have a worse prognosis thanyounger patients.\"We don't know enough about attitudes among physicians; we don't ask elderly patients what theywant; and we don't do enough specific trials forthem.\"Professor Silvio Monfardini, from the Division ofMedical Oncology, Padova, Italy, agreed on theneed for trials. \"If this is not done we will discrim-inate against an already vulnerable group and denyus information on a very relevant part of the breastcancer population in Europe.\"Targeting treatment on specific age groups is a steptowards individual packages of care, which is thedirection signposted by research. Dr Alane Koki,Chief Scientific Officer of the French biotechnol-ogy company, Ipsogen, said that significantprogress was being made towards identifying thegenetic make-up of individual tumours, allowingtreatment choices that are based on personalisedinformation.Ipsogen has developed a breast cancer profile chipfor use in local pathology laboratories. WIDENING THE FIGHT The next EBCC, in Nice in 2006, will be chairedby Alberto Costa, a breast surgeon from Pavia, Italy,and Director of the Milan-based European Schoolof Oncology. At previous EBCCs he moderated thedrafting sessions that developed the influentialconference statements. Dr Costa has a number of plans for Nice. He willinvite experienced breast care nurses, to spread theconcept of specialist breast care nursing beyondNorthern Europe.Dr Costa also hopes that some of the big cancercharities in Europe will attend, creating a forumfor discussion on how to fund multi-centre, multi-national trials on breast cancer at a Europeanlevel. He said: \"If we can include some of the major can-cer charities in the Nice EBCC, it will strengthenlinks between those who raise money and theresearchers and clinicians who need the funding totarget treatment more precisely. If this led towardssome national cancer charities combiningresources to fund a major European cancer trial,that would be a fantastic step forward.\" The Florence, Brussels and Barcelona Statements can be found on the Eusoma web site at www.eusoma.org (go to Guidelines and Publications, EUSOMA Statements) The consensus session, chaired by Alberto Costa, where delegates vote on which issues to prioritise in the closing statementSpotlight on... Breast cancer is the commonest cancer and the most frequent cause of cancer death inwomen throughout Europe. However, mor- tality from breast cancer is decreasing as a result ofconcerted action by all parties involved (women atrisk, doctors, nurses, researchers, patients, journal-ists etc.). Partnership is paying off. Increasingnumbers of breast cancer patients may nowadaysachieve a normal life expectancy.All previous European Breast Cancer Conferencesproduced Statements that became important toolsin communicating with politicians and the mediaand we want to continue building upon this suc-cessful approach. Previous statements (Florence,Brussels and Barcelona) addressed the importanceof screening programmes, translational research,patient involvement, risk assessment and theneed for breast cancer to be managed in multi-disciplinary clinics (breast units) according to theguidelines recently approved by the EuropeanParliament. The 4th European Breast CancerConference in Hamburg reached a consensus onkey issues during the closing plenary session on the20th March 2004. Clinicians, scientists, advocatesand health care consumers representing 3,599 par-ticipants used a computerised voting system to for-mulate the Hamburg Statement.The delegates of the 4th European Breast CancerConference wish to give priority to the following fourareas: ACADEMIC RESEARCH Excessively rigid legislation, unjustifiable adminis-trative restrictions and government budget cuts arethreatening cancer research in general, and breastcancer research in particular. In addition, the newEuropean Directive on clinical trials might exacer-bate this by leaving cancer research almost entire-ly to the initiative of the pharmaceutical industry.Whilst not denying the contribution of those phar- maceutical companies engaged in new drug devel-opment, the participants in the 4th EuropeanBreast Cancer Conference are concerned that thissituation will lead to a decline of non-pharmaco-logical research (in surgery, imaging, radiation ther-apy, treatment tailoring etc.). This negative effecton independent academic research will alsoencourage even more gifted European researchersto emigrate to the United States to complete theirstudies and projects.Participants in the 4th European Breast CancerConference call for a more determined financialand structural support to academic research, facil-itation of the free circulation of tissue and bloodsamples within the European Union for researchpurposes, and a greater involvement of patientsand consumers in research planning and monitor-ing. They also propose that funds originating fromthe EU central budget (e.g. a percentage of thecurrent annual tobacco subsidy) are re-allocatedto transnational research on breast cancer and alsothat private donations to breast cancer researchare encouraged through the raising of the taxdeductibility level currently imposed on such con-tributions in all Member States. INDIVIDUAL RISK ASSESSMENT Women increasingly want to know about theirindividual risk of developing breast cancer. Allbreast units should put in place special clinics forthe assessment of individual risk and developresearch in the field. Counselling should include adiscussion of all proven risk-reducing measures,their availability within the relevant healthcare sys-tem and assistance in privacy protection. As risk-reducing interventions are being developed theissue of their availability, at no cost to the patient,should be addressed.The Hamburg Statement The partnership driving the European agenda on breast cancer I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 39Spotlight on... 40I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004For women with a serious family history of breast cancer full genetic counselling should be offeredand be made freely available, without cost, to thepatient. Genetic testing, when indicated, shouldalso be provided at no cost to the patient. AGE LIMITS Most diagnostic and treatment protocols andprocedures in breast cancer have age limits, butevidence is lacking for most of these limits. The4th European BreastCancer Conference wishes to draw atten-tion to the growing sizeof the elderly popula-tion and their specialneeds, and proposesthat participation inclinical trials is decid-ed according to physi-ological status ratherthan age and thatno upper age limit islaid down in thedesign of standard pre-vention and treatmentplans. CARE AFTER BREAST CANCERThe 4th EuropeanBreast Cancer Confe-rence recognises the need to redefine the conceptof care for breast cancer patients after primarytreatment. Routine continuous follow-up, as cur-rently practised, does not serve women well. Careafter breast cancer should not just aim at detect-ing local relapse and second primary tumours butshould also include psychological support and themanagement of treatment side effects. On theother hand, no consensus seems to exist on theduration and frequency of follow-up, nor on theschedule of requested examinations. For thosepatients treated outside a research setting, careafter primary breast cancer treatment should beplanned by the multidisciplinary team and indi-vidually tailored following discussion with the patient. CONCLUSION Breast cancer incidence is increasing, and deservespriority. The four aspects addressed in this document -academic research, assessment of individual risk,breast cancer in the elderly and care after breast cancer - representmajor issues in breastcancer management.Research is fuellingprogress, CancerGroup of Organisation for the andTreatment of Cancer(EORTC-BCG) andthe European Society of Mastology (EUSOMA), together with EuropaDonna, the European Breast Cancer Coalition,will work towards these goals bylobbying European Governments, the EuropeanParliament and the European Commission andby mobilising health-service providers, thescientific community and the healthcareindustry. You are invited to spread this statement,and the proposals put forward in it, in order tofurther advance the improvements already madein breast cancer research, treatment and policyin Europe. The measures called for by EBCC-4delegates will be reviewed at EBCC-5 to be heldin Nice, France in March 2006. The Hamburg Statement was published in the European Journal of Cancer vol. 40, pp. 1810-1811, and is available online at www.eusoma.org and www.fecs.beImpact Factor 42I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004Advanced head and neck cancers Transatlantic collaboration shows results Concurrent postoperative admin- istration of cisplatin (Platinol)and radiotherapy has been established by two separate studies tobe the treatment of choice in peoplewith advanced head and neck cancerwho have undergone surgery.Taken together, the results of theEuropean Organisation for Researchand Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)study and the US Radiation TherapyOncology Group (RTOG) study, bothpublished in the May 6 issue of theNew England Journal of Medicine (vol 350, pp 1945-1952 and 1937-1944,respectively), showed benefits from theconcurrent therapies compared toradiotherapy alone. This treatment wasalready the established therapeuticoption for tumours that had spreadlocally, but which were not consideredoperable.But while both studies were positive -showing enhanced disease-free survivalat five years in the EORTC group andenhanced two-year local and regionalcontrol in the RTOG group - only theEORTC study demonstrated signifi-cant increases in survival. \"These of Radio-Oncology at theOncology Institute of SouthernSwitzerland, Bellinzona.Squamous cell cancer of the head andneck is the sixth most common cancerworldwide, with a lifetime risk of 2% formen, and 0.6% for women. There areapproximately 76,000 new cases of oral-cavity, pharyngeal and laryngeal cancerdiagnosed each year in WesternEurope. \"Patients have a geneticpredisposition to head and neck cancerwhich favours malignant transformationif they come into contact with tobaccoand alcohol,\" said Professor Bernier.Early disease is generally treated with either radiotherapy or surgery, whichhave a similar likelihood of controllingtumours. But for patients with locallyadvanced disease - i.e. disease that hasspread locally from its site of origin, butnot to distant sites in the body - treat-ment is more complex, requiring surgerywith postoperative radiotherapy.Unfortunately such patients still show aparticularly high rate of local recurrence.When two or more regional lymphnodes are involved, or there is extra capsular spread of disease or micro-scopically involved mucosal margins of resection, there are particularly highrates local recurrence (27-61%), dis-tant metastases (18-21%) and of death, five-year survivalrate of 27-34%, indicating the need fordevelopment of additional treatments.Such statistics have led investigators tolook at different ways of deliveringchemotherapy, including inductionchemotherapy (consisting of severalcourses of chemotherapy before radio-therapy); sequential chemotherapy(where chemotherapy is administeredat a different time from radiotherapy);concurrent chemotherapy (wherechemotherapy is given at the sametime as radiotherapy) and adjuvantchemotherapy (administered afterpatients have been rendered diseasefree). Studies looking at deliveringsequential chemotherapy postopera-tively have revealed little in the way ofbenefit. Most noteworthy, the Janet Fricker Professor Jacques Bernier, principalinvestigator of theEORTC trial, is an explanationfor discrepanciesbetween the resultsof the two trialsImpact Factor I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 43classed as stage III or IV, or had to show high-risk characteristics such as histo-logic evidence of invasion of two or moreregional lymph nodes, extracapsularextension of nodal disease or microscop-ically involved mucosal margins.\"Cancers of the nasopharynx wereexcluded from the studies because it wasfelt they had a different natural historyfrom the other head and neck cancers(with faster metastasis) and would skewresults,\" said Dr Bernier. All patients hadundergone surgery with curative intentand those with distant metastases wereexcluded from the study.\"In both studies cisplatin was selectedbecause it was considered the bestagent at the time to increase the controlwithout increasing the toxicity\", said DrBernier. \"Although 5-FU, for the increasing mucosal reactivity toradiotherapy and can result in patientsneeding parental feeding and severelyadverse effects on quality of life.\" POSITIVE RESULTS Both studies yielded positive results. Inthe EORTC trial, after an average ofapproximately five years, progression-free survival was 47% in the group ofpatients treated with cisplatin plus radi-ation, compared with only 36% in thegroup of patients treated with radiationalone. The overall survival rates at fiveyears were 53% for patients treated withcisplatin and radiation therapy, com-pared with only 40% for patients treat-ed with radiation alone. Severe sideeffects (grade 3 or higher) occurred in41% of patients treated with combina-tion therapy, compared with only 21%of patients treated with radiation alone.But severe mucosal adverse effectswere similar in the two groups.In the RTOG trial, after approximately46 months cancer-free survival was22% higher in the patients treated withradiation and chemotherapy, comparedInter-group study 0034, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 1990 (vol 8, pp 838-847), showed that thesequential of cisplatin reduced theincidence of nodal and distant failure,but produced no effect on survival. However, other studies suggested thatfor patients with inoperable head andneck cancers, chemotherapy was bene-ficial when delivered at the same timeas radiotherapy. The RTOG 88-24study, published in 1997, which gavecisplatin in a single high dose(100mg/m 2) on days 1, 22 and 43 of radiotherapy ( Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 777-782), showed control and increasedsurvival. Whilst severe toxicity occurredin 20% of cases treated with adjuvantchemo-radiation, 48% of patientsremained alive at three years and 81%had locoregional control of disease.A study published in 1996 showed ben-efits from combining postoperativeradiotherapy with weekly cisplatin infu-sions for locally Oncol Biol Phys, vol pp improved out-comes combining studies, disease-free sur-vival was increased for patients in thecombined therapy arm compared tothose in the control arm, who justreceived radiotherapy.This was the background againstwhich the recently published EORTCand RTOG trials were started, in 1994and 1995 respectively. Both weremuch larger than the earlier studiesand both aimed to establish whetheradding cisplatin concurrently to post-operative radiotherapy improved out-comes for patients with high-riskresected head and neck cancers. Thefocus on cisplatin was due to its pre-sumed effect of \"radiosensitising\" cells - i.e. rendering cells more vulnerableto the toxic effects of radiation whenadministered concurrently - whichwas expected to yield a greater benefitthan the sum of the benefits of radio-therapy and chemotherapy consideredseparately. (The interaction betweencisplatin and ionizing radiation is notfully understood, but may be achievedby the synchronisation and redistribu-tion of tumour cells into the more sen-sitive G2-M phase of the cell cycle, orby the cisplatin creating abnormalridges within DNA that inhibits itscapacity to spontaneously repair afterradiotherapy.) PROTOCOLS AND PATIENTS The EORTC trial involved patients withstage III or IV head and neck cancers.After undergoing surgery, 167 patientswere randomly assigned to receiveradiotherapy alone (66 Gy over a periodof six weeks) and 167 to receive thesame radiotherapy regimen combinedwith 100 mg/m 2cisplatin on days 1,22 and 43 of the radiotherapy regimen. Thestudy, which had a median duration offollow-up of 60 months, was designedto detect an absolute increase of 15% indisease-free survival. The RTOG trial,which followed exactly the sametreatment protocol in a similar patientpopulation, assigned 210 patients topostoperative radiotherapy and 206 tocombined therapy, with a medianduration of follow-up of 45.9 months.The trial was designed to detect anabsolute increase of 15% in the two-yearrate of local and regional control.The eligibility criteria for the two trialsdiffered, but overall patients had to be ingood general condition to receivechemotherapy and to have a previouslyuntreated, histologically proven squa-mous cell carcinoma arising from theoral cavity, larynx orhypopharynx. The cancer had to beImpact Factor 44I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004to those treated with radiation alone. However, overall survival was similar.Cancer recurrences at or near the siteof origin occurred in 18% of patientstreated with combined therapy, com-pared to 28% of patients treated withradiation alone at approximately twoyears following treatment. Severe side-effects occurred in 34% of patientstreated with radiation alone, comparedwith 77% of patients treated withchemotherapy and radiation therapy,and in this study four patient deathswere directly attributable to treatment.\"The magnitude of a 13-15% differ-ence in survival observed in theEORTC trial was both much higherthan the RTOG trial and higher thanwe'd been expecting, suggesting thereare additional mechanisms in play thatwe've yet to determine,\" said DrBernier, who wants to find out why thebeneficial effect was so much higherthan in the RTOG trial. Differences inthe presentation of morbidity datamake comparisons of the two trials dif-ficult. There are, however, suggestionsthat differences in overall survivalfound between the two trials might beattributable to differences in the typesof patients recruited to each study,since they did not use identical eligi-bility criteria.Another theory, put forward by Dr Jay S.Cooper, principal investigator of theRTOG trial and head of RadiationOncology at Maimonides MedicalCenter in New York City, is that overtime an effect on overall survival maystill be seen in the RTOG trial. \"If youdon't find a mathematically statisticallysignificant change, it doesn't mean onedoesn't exist,\" he said. It is also possible,he suggests, that certain lifestyle issuesthat contributed to the cancer (such asheavy drinking and smoking) causedother problems, such as heart disease.\"Even if you do a better job of control-ling tumours, it may not translateimmediately into better survival, because they'll still die of other things,\"he said.Investigators from EORTC and RTOGhoped to review differences betweenthe two trials when they met at theSixth International Conference onHead and Neck Cancer in August. \"Weplan to screen for variations in patientselection and treatment density acrossthe two trials to see if these couldaccount for the differences in magni-tude,\" said Dr Bernier.Despite the positive findings, neithertrial showed any reductions in distantmetastases, and disease still recurredlocally in 30% of patients, demonstrat-ing that further improvements are stillneeded. One way forward, suggestedDr Bernier, may be to give chemothera-py immediately after surgery. \"We'dkeep the chemo as used in this study,but also give a weekly cycle of chemo-therapy seven to ten days after surgeryuntil the beginning of radiotherapy.\" TOXICITY CONCERNS Issues remain concerning toxicity, andfuture clinical trials evaluating agentsnot associated with such a high rate ofside-effects are warranted. One noveltargeted therapeutic approach underinvestigation is the agent Erbitux(cetuximab), which is a monoclonalantibody designed to bind to EGFR, aprotein involved in the growth andreplication of cells that is often over-expressed in cancer cells. This binding action is believed to pre-vent or reduce the replication of thecancer cells, resulting in anti-cancerresponses. In a trial presented by theErbitux Head and Neck Study Group atthe 40th Annual Meeting of theAmerican Society of Clinical Oncologyin June, 417 patients with locallyadvanced head and neck cancer wererandomised to receive Erbitux plushigh-dose radiation, or high-dose radia-tion was patientstreated with Erbitux plus radiation,compared with only 44% for those treat-ed with radiation alone. The mediansurvival increased from 28 months inthe standard arm to 54 months in theexperimental group. The only notableside-effect associated with Erbitux wasskin rash. NEXT STEPS Advances are also needed in radiother-apy. In an editorial which appeared inthe May issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, alongside the EORTC and RTOG trial results (vol 350, pp 1997-1998), MicheleSaunders, from the AcademicDepartment of Oncology at UniversityCollege London, and Ana Rojas, fromMount Vernon Hospital, Middlesex,UK, suggest that the next obvious steptowards further improving outcomeswould be to identify a more effectiveradiotherapy regimen. \"The radiobiolo-gy of radiotherapy as the sole agent inthe treatment of squamous cell cancerof the head and neck is well under-stood, but the optimal dose, time frameand regimen of fractionation in a multi-disciplinary setting are not.\" Two recentphase III trials indicate that use of ashorter than conventional overall treat-ment time for post-operative radiother-apy could improve tumour control andsurvival. Dr Bernier believes the two studiesmake a convincing case for the standarduse of the concurrent combined thera-py, at least in the age group 70 andunder. \"This transatlantic collaborationjustifies the fact that most countriesnow consider the combination of highdoses of cisplatin and radiotherapy to bethe new algorithm in the decision mak-ing process for locally advanced headand neck carcinomas treated with surgery,\" he said.Patient Voice CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004Nothing about us without us Europe's patient advocates gather for the first time From every corner of Europe and beyond, they descended on Milan. Patients andformer patients with breast cancer,leukaemia, prostate and testicular can-cers, multiple myelomas or lung cancer. Some were experienced cancer advocates and cam-paigners, others were active in support groups, orwere in the first stages of setting up a patient associ-ation. Yet others, from countries with no history ofpatient organisation, came as individuals. All hadone purpose in mind: to assert the voice of thepatient in all decisions that might affect them, inorder to improve the outlook for all cancer patients.This was the first meeting of the European CancerPatient Coalition (ECPC), held at the EuropeanInstitute of Oncology in Milan, June 12-13. Billedas a Masterclass in Patient Advocacy, it wasdesigned to equip delegates with the informationthey need to campaign effectively for an end toneedless suffering. Cancer patients suffer whenthey don't have the information they need at theright time, when their disease is picked up too lateor when they are treated inappropriately by medicalstaff with too little specialist experience. Even assurvivors, their quality of life is often blighted by alack of understanding and support.Using the European School of Oncology's officiallanguage ('bad English'), a procession of experi-enced patient activists, politicians, and medicaland research professionals filled in this interna-tional gathering on everything they might ever needAnna Wagstaff to know. This stretched from the details ofEurope's complex democratic, bureaucratic, legal,regulatory and consultative structures to advice ondealing with politicians and the media. There wasalso a focus on reaching out to other patients,working in alliance with one another, withdisability groups, and with the medical professionand drugs industry.Perhaps most valued by the delegates were oppor-tunities, during coffee breaks and meal times, toswap anecdotes and contact details and tonetwork: \"Everyone I went to sit next to had some-thing I could learn from,\" said Lia van Ginneken-Noordman, from the Multiple Myeloma andWaldenstr\u00f6m Macroglobulinemia Patients Associ-ation in the Netherlands (CKP), after busyevening chair-swapping at formal dinner.ECPC Chairman Lynn Faulds Wood said: \"Ourfirst Masterclass in Cancer Patient Advocacy wasan incredible experience. Over 100 cancerpatients organisations were represented, from 33countries, and every session was packed - no oneseemed to want to leave the meeting to take a lookat Milan! ECPC aims to be a sort of 'virtual tradeunion' of cancer patients, sharing ideas and bestpractice to help reduce inequalities within coun-tries and across Europe, to improve access to goodtreatment for all.\"We are a potent force and together we can help tochange our world: our mantra - 'Nothing About Us,Without Us!' - is becoming a reality.\"Patient Voice CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 I 49quiet and attentive throughout the weekend sprang to their feet to tell their stories. EkkeBuechler of the Austrian prostate cancer groupSelbsthilfe Prostatakrebs talked about the atti-tude of a union rep at his workplace who hadspecial responsibility for disabilities. \"I went tothis man after my prostatectomy, to ask for somehelp securing a less physically demanding job.He told me: 'You're looking good, you have allyour arms and legs, you're not blind - perhaps you could lose some weight. So what's the problem?' \"He added: \"It's ironic that so many cancerpatients are getting back their lives thanks toscientific research, only to find civil society thendenying them their lives by excluding them.\"Catherine Casserley, of the UK Disability RightsCommission, said that all but four countries inEurope have yet to introduce laws to complywith the EU Disability Rights Directive, forwhich there is a deadline of 2006. She urgeddelegates to campaign to ensure that theirgovernments define \"disability\" in such a way asto include the sort of chronic, often intermittent,and almost always invisible impairments sufferedby cancer patients.Many delegates had strong feelings on whetheror not cancer patients wanted to be labelledTHE PERSONAL AND THE POLITICAL Two former Health Ministers, Italy's UmbertoVeronesi and Holland's Else Borst-Eilers,contributed to a round table discussion on politicsand cancer. They agreed that access to top qualitytreatment and screening remains shockinglyunequal between and even within the countries ofEurope. However, they said that politicians facepressures from many directions, and while theywill always sound sympathetic behind closeddoors, you must use every weapon at yourdisposal if you want to see real change.Public campaigns in the Netherlandshelped to slash waiting lists, and in the UKgave chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)patients access to the drugs they need freeof charge. Taking test cases through thecourts has also proved effective, forinstance, in establishing the obligation ofnational health systems to pay for treat-ment abroad, if the patient cannot get thetreatment he or she has a right to expect intheir own country.Stella Kyriakides, President of EuropaDonna - The European Breast CancerCoalition - told the story of the longcampaign that led to an important break-through on breast cancer policy at theEuropean Parliament. Patient advocates,she said, are uniquely powerful; they takepainful personal life events and put themto use in driving political change. Speaking fromthe floor, Rita Rosa Martin, from the Germanbreast cancer organisation Breast Health, arguedthat if national governments and European insti-tutions want to consult and involve patientsgroups, then they must provide funds so thatgroups can buy in equipment and training to playan effective role. \"I for one,\" she said, \"am nolonger prepared to be grateful simply for beingasked for my opinion or advice.\" The example ofthe Netherlands, where lobbying led to 30 millioneuro of state funds being made available annuallyto patient groups, was held up as a possible leadfor ECPC and national groups to follow. WE WANT TO LIVE , NOT JUST SURVIVE The session on Discrimination in the Workplacewas like no other. Delegates who had remained Stella Kyriakides,President of Europa DonnaPatient Voice 50I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004\"disabled,\" but agreed that ECPC should work within the European Disability Forum, and thateveryone had to stick together to promote aculture, backed by legislation, that supports cancer patients whowant to remain in work. STRATEGIC ALLIANCESECPC Chairman LynnFaulds Wood spoke ofthe working systems,research institutions,the pharmaceuticalindustry, and politics. Few of these profes-sionals, she argued, have the single-minded determination that hasmotivated her ever since the day she was toldthat she stood only a 34% chance of surviving bowel cancer, and had to face the prospect of her three-year-old son growing up without her.\"That,\" said Lynn \"is what we patients bring tothe table.\"Before she was diagnosed, Lynn's general practi-tioner told her she had nothing to worry about.Later on, using her experience as an investigativejournalist, she discovered that, the world over,the advice doctors are given on how to differen-tiate bowel cancer from other bowel disordershas little backing in research. So she formed astrategic alliance with a number of specialists, tofind out more about the key warning symptomsdoctors should look for. \"Just a few patients canchange the world a little bit,\" she said, \"if wework in alliance with others.\"Two patient advocates, Sandy Craine and Eliza-beth Rees, told the story of a similar strategic alliance they put together in the UK to fight forthe right of all CML patients to be prescribedGlivec, free of charge. Their hard fought battlewas won because they campaigned alongsidetheir doctors and the drugs company Novartis.How best to work with drugs companies wasseen as a tricky question. Some delegates saidtheir groups were wary of inappropriate pressure, and would never accept funding fromthe industry. Others said they couldn't survivewithout it and they didn't feel too compromised.Some of the activities of the ECPC aresupported through no-strings grants from sixdrugs companies in accordance with the sort oftransparent funding policy that is increasinglybeing adopted by patient groups (see www.ecpc-online.org/policy_funding.html). Lynn FauldsWood said: \"The interests of patients and theindustry are by no means identical, and wherethey diverge we say so. But where they do coin-cide, it is important that we seize any opportu-nity to collaborate to achieve our ends.\" \"Just a few patients can change the world a little bit, if we work in alliance with others\" ECPC Chairman Lynn Faulds Wood The European Cancer Patient Coalition (www.ecpc-online.org ) is the voice of European Cancer Patients.It was established in 2003 to represent the views of cancer patients in the European healthcare debate and to provide a forum for European cancer patients to exchange information and share best practice experiences.Membership is open to organisations dedicated to advocacy, support and care of cancer patients and their carers.ECPC can be contacted at:ECPC, PO Box 555, (0)20 at:info@ecpc-online.org Patient Voice CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 I 53WhyI got involved in cancer advocacy:Four ECPC delegates tell their stories Eoghan Cahill Men Against Cancer, Ireland Eoghan Cahill, from County Cavan in Ireland, had to call on all his reserves of stubborn determinationand his creative skills as a commercial artist, inorder to get home from hospital with his self-esteem intact.His doctor had warned himthat surgery for prostate can-cer risked leaving him impo-tent and incontinent. But hehad also told him the inconti-nence was nothing to worryabout, \"You will have all theadvice you need.\" He didn'tget advice. What he got was amassive nappy that hardly fit-ted into his trousers, andadvertised to the passingworld: 'This man has lost con-trol of his bladder'. Eoghanwas having none of it. \"By this time,\" he said, \"I'dspent three weeks in hospital, and had seen howmen had come in for their operation, proud andtall, and had left bewildered and humiliated, someof them leaving dribbles of urine on the hospitalfloor before they'd even started their journeyshome.\" Armed only with a pair of scissors, a roll of stickytape, some plastic bags and the offending giantnappy, he cut, stuck, fashioned and moulded him- self an effective lining for his pants, invisible to theoutside world. And he went home. In the end, itwas his local chemist who led him to the advicethat had been so disastrously lacking following sur-gery. He put Eoghan in touch with a communitynurse who happened to specialise in problems of incontinence. She broughtneat absorbent pouches andshowed him how pelvic One man's postprostatectomy problems hadbeen greatly alleviated. But hewas very angry.The story of how Eoghanmoved to co-founding MAC(Men Against Cancer), even-tually teaming up with theEuropean prostate canceradvocacy group Europa Uomo and attending the ECPC conference,could match any told of a pleasant evening in a(smoke-free) Irish pub. One small part of itinvolved a throwaway comment by an eminentoncologist addressing a conference of supportgroups called by the Irish Cancer Society. Theoncologist said: \"We all know how backward menare about coming forward for medical treat-ment...\". For Eoghan, who had been through a \"Just to talk to someone who's been there, done that and wears the T-shirt lifts a huge load of fear off you\" ly refreshed, so it's not just a one-off effort. I would like to see better training of frontline primary carestaff to improve early detection, and addressing thequestion of over-treatment is very important. But atthe end of the day, we are patient support groups,and we mustn't forget why we are here. Because Iremember vividly what a dark, dark journey I trav-elled. It doesn't matter how loving and caring yourfamily is. Just to talk to someone who's been there,done that and wears the T-shirt lifts a huge load offear off you.\" Lt. Gen. Antonio Avelino Pereira Pinto Portuguese Association of Patients with Prostate Diseases When General Pinto found- ed the Portuguese Associa-tion of Patients with ProstateDiseases one and half yearsago, he did so somewhatreluctantly. As far as personalcancer journeys go, his hadbeen relatively free of trauma.He had a good doctor, who,on diagnosis, had encouragedhim to seek a second opinion(an offer General Pintodeclined) and then carefullywent through the options: Surgery would deal with the cancer, but carried a60% risk of impotence and a 15% risk of inconti-nence. Without surgery, because the cancer wasrelatively slow-growing, it could be contained fora good 10 years or so by regular medication, but inthe end it would probably be fatal.General Pinto, who was 62 at the time, took thevery personal decision to forego surgery, and heset about enjoying the life he had left to him -something he does very well. \"I told my wife I hada prostate problem. I never said it was cancer,personal battle to get information and who was attending this meeting uninvited, that was the laststraw. \"That comment just pressed my button,\" hesaid. \"I stood up and shouted 'THAT IS NOTTRUE!' and the room went silent. I said: 'If menhave a tendency to try to play down problems withtheir waterworks, it's because they don't know thedangers until it's too late. And whose fault is this?'I asked, and I pointed around the room, 'Every sin-gle one of you professionals in this room haveknown for years the true story and have neveronce made the effort to set up an awareness cam-paign to make men of this country aware of thedangers of prostate and testicular cancer. Andshame on you!'\"Clearly Eoghan was not the only angry man in theroom, because he sat down to a rousing applause -even the eminent oncologistjoined in. After the meeting,the Chief Executive of theIrish Cancer Society collaredEoghan and his friend, andMen Against Cancer (MAC)was born.Today, Eoghan and his col-leagues in MAC remain avital source of informationand support. Ireland is nowrunning its first prostate andtesticular cancer awarenesscampaign, using plenty ofhumour to encourage men tothink about the upkeep of their bodies the waythey do the maintenance of their cars.What did Eoghan learn from the ECPC meeting?\"I learned from the experience of others aboutcommunication, about dealing with politicians andabout creating powerful alliances by combiningsmall groups together, as we did with EuropaUomo, which will soon have groups from 13 dif-ferent countries.\"And how will he use it? \"I would like to see the cur-rent awareness campaign expanded and continual- Patient Voice 54I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004\"What could I do?

If she is going to wake up every morning and have to look close-ly at me to see whether her husband was dying,she would have died before me!\"Today, he has been living very happily with cancerfor more than 12 years, and his illness impingesvery little on his life.So when, in 2002, his doctor begged him to startup a prostate cancer organisation in Portugal, hefelt little of the sense of personal anger and injus-tice that motivates many cancer advocates. Hedid, however, recognise that many lives are beinglost needlessly. \"Every day, between five and sixmen die of prostate cancer, and there are around140,000 currently diagnosed with the disease. Yetvery few men in my country know what prostatecancer is. Most don't even know they have aprostate,\" he says.General Pinto's doctor was insistent, arguing thatit is crucial that patients speak out about their dis-ease and provide a point of information for menwho may be reluctant to visit their doctor. Withhis gregarious and optimistic outlook on life,Pinto, argued the doctor, was the man for the mis-sion. \"What could I do?\" said Pinto, \"He hassaved my life for 12 years. I couldn't say 'No'. Asa military man, I accepted the mission.\"He set about the task in a systematic way. He setup the Portuguese Association of Patients withProstate Diseases, andrecruited patients via theirurologists. The Associationnow has between 30 and 40members, but is still at a veryearly stage. \"When we have100 members, we will set upproper statutes and func-tions.\" He runs a help andinformation line from hishome, and has even fieldedcalls from France. He is inthe process of setting up awebsite. But he still worksvery much alone, so when hisdoctor told him about meetings of the ECPC andof Europa Uomo (which held its founding meet-ing in Milan), he was curious and eager to attend. He learned a lot. For a start, he met a womanfrom a breast cancer organisation in Portugal thathe had never known about, and she told him about other groups, for ovarian and colon cancer.\"When I return, I will contact these organisations,and we will try to decide how we can lobbytogether\".\"I have found out so much from this meetingabout how people help patients. I will take theinformation back with me and study it and decidehow to proceed. I want to start a newsletter withinformation about this seminar to send to mymembers.\"One of General Pinto's priorities has been lobbyingfor prostate cancer to be classified as a chronic dis-ease for the purpose of eligibility for free treatment.His present treatment, for example, costs himaround 30 euro a month.He is also keen to spread information amongPortugal's general practitioners, so that they pickup symptoms quicker and have a better under-standing of treatment options. \"The importantthing is for people to be diagnosed and treated ear-lier, and for them to realise that life does not stopbecause you are diagnosed with prostate cancer.Life is there to be lived.\"As for his personal goals, \"My aim is to live threeyears more, so I will complete 50 years of mar-riage, and my wife and I can celebrate our goldenanniversary.\" You sense that this is a man who will accomplish his mission.

She survivedbecause she knew someonewho was able to get her seenby a specialist for a secondopinion.

Again, he was told: if you want a cure,transplantation is the onlyoption. However, Jan's firstdoctor had mentioned a drugthat was still under develop-ment - Glivec (imatinib),then known only as STI-571and not available on the mar-ket - and Jan determined tofind out more.He turned to the Internet,and found nothing inGerman. Luckily, his grasp ofEnglish was just about suffi-cient to allow him to wade through the rapidly increasing amount of infor-mation coming onto the Web from patients, aca-demics and researchers. He located a paper writ-ten by a doctor in Mannheim and e-mailed himasking for more information. This doctor, whoturned out to be one of the best CML experts inGermany, phoned him, and after a conversationsister had been diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years previously. He just told me to 'wait and see'.\"Luckily, Anna had a friend who was on good termswith a cancer specialist. She went to see him atBratislava's cancer hospital, and underwent all hertests on the same day under the same roof. Fourdays later a lump measuring 2.8 cm was surgicallyremoved, and two weeks later she was started on acourse of adjuvant treatment combining radio-and chemotherapy. That was in 1997. Because sheis considered to be genetically at high risk, she stillattends a check up every three months. Once ayear she has tests to check for metastases.Anna knows that not everyone is as lucky as she is,and every year people are dying simply becausethey did not have the information they neededwhen they needed it. \"The most important thing,\"she says, \"is to inform people about all cancers.Very few people know, forinstance, that you can askyour general practitioner torefer you to breast screeningeven if there is no screeningcentre in your area, and that ifthey refuse this request, youcan go elsewhere.\"When her doctor told herabout the ECPC meeting inMilan, she saw it as a greatopportunity to set somethingup in Slovakia. \"I am so glad Icame,\" she said. \"Before com-ing here, I discussed with mydoctor the possibility of setting up an organisationand developing a cancer information website.After this meeting, I have a lot of new ideas. Iwant to go to schools to raise awareness aboutcancer among children - they have access to theInternet at school and will be able to pass oninformation about prevention and treatment to Patient Voice 56I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004\"Very few people know ...that you can ask your general practitioner to refer you to breast screening even if there is no screening centre in your area, and that if they refuse this request, you can go elsewhere.\" lasting two hours, Jan knew a great deal more. The Mannheim university hospital was runningan international trial comparing Interferon alone(the standard drug at that time) with STI-571(now known as Glivec). The new drug was show-ing terrific early results, but no-one knew how itwould behave in the longer term. So far it hadlargely been tested on patients who had failed torespond to Interferon, but never on patients likeJan who had undergone no previous treatment.As this trial was already closed, joining a smalltrial combining STI-571 with Interferon was hisonly option to get access to the new drug.Jan, the scientist, took a hard look at the statisticsand opted to join the trial: \"I calculated all theprobability values, and concluded that mychances of dying would have been much highergoing directly into transplantation.\" And so far,that has turned out to be a very good choice.\"During almost three years of treatment I havepretty much lived my normal life. I have hardlyany side effects, my life has returned to normal.\"Like so many patients involved in the Glivec tri-als, Jan wanted to make sure other patients ben-efited from the information he had. So being anIT professional, it was a simple matter to set up anew website: Leukaemie-Online.de.And in a matter of weeks, Europe's 100 million orso German-speaking population had their firstaccess to information on CML in a language theycould understand.With the help of a few other volunteers, Jan siftsthrough information he picks up from newslet-ters, health professionals and patients all over theworld, and in particular from US and Asian onlinesupport groups, and selects the stuff most rele-vant to patients in Germany. He then translates itand posts it up on his site, where it is accessed bythousands of patients at a rate of 45,000 hits amonth.Jan is convinced that many German doctors are continuing to recommend bone marrow trans-plants to their CML patients as a first line oftreatment. \"Doctors are no different to any otherprofession,\" he says. \"About 80% of them are justdoing their job, some 10% are alarmingly ill-informed, and about 10% are brilliant and have amission.\"The problem is among the 80%, because theydon't just deal with CML, they deal with all kindsof cancer, and they are often slow to pick up onnew developments which have revolutionisedleukaemia treatment in recent years. The missionof Leukaemie-Online.de is therefore to informpatients about all their options, so they can chal-lenge their doctors, and ask why they can't try thistreatment or another. If the doctor has a good rea-son, fine. But if not, the patient should insist onexploring the options further.\"Jan is a founding member of ECPC, and he got alot of benefit from the meeting. He met in personfellow CML patients from Canada, UK and Israelwhom he already knew through Internetexchanges, and he found out about internationalgroups working in a similar field. \"I had a pictureof what was happening in Germany, but notEurope wide and not in other cancers.\" He is nowconvinced about the need for European cancerpatients to join forces. \"When I saw what hap-pened with the EU clinical trials directive, whichis now heavily damaging life-saving research inEurope, I can see that we have to work at thelevel of the EU and not only at national level. Ithink it is very important not only to have CMLsupport groups or breast cancer support groups,and not only to have German or UK supportgroups, but to have a European perspective for allcancer patients. That is why I became a founding member ofECPC.\" Patient Voice CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 I 57\"When I saw what happened with the EU clinical trials directive, which is heavily damaging life-saving research in Europe, I can see that we haveto work at the level of the EU and not only at national level.\"e-World I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 59Betting on e-collaboration Interview with Dr Alex Jadad All over the world, communities are grappling in isolation with universal questions of how to prevent cancer and improve the lives of patients. But is there any reason, in this Internet age, whywe should not share ideas and adapt effective strategies to local conditions. Alex Jadad , Director of the Centre for Global eHealth Innovation, believes there is not. And he is trying to prove it. Global collaboration is an elusive goals pursued by many people for many differentends. What makes you so convinced it canwork in the case of cancer? A LEXJADAD I'm not convinced it will work, but it's worth a try and I'm giving it my best shot. We areall very good at believing that we are dealing withunique issues in every country, so we keepcompeting with one another to reinvent the wheel.Now with the Internet, we have a tool that has thepotential to give communities everywhere thesame access to vast quantities of vital knowledgeand information and the means to communicatewith one another. The problem is that the digitaldivide is actually widening, and most of the worldstill has no Internet access, nor the ability to usethe information it provides. So I am trying to bringpeople located in strategic areas of the worldtogether, and see whether we can make a realdifference. There are all manner of urgent health issues facing communities around theworld. Why focus on cancer?A LEX JADAD The Centre for Global eHealth Innovation, in Toronto, does not only deal withby Anna Wagstaff cancer, but cancer is a central interest. Onereason for this is that I am a specialist in sup-portive case and work mainly with cancerpatients. A few years ago the International UnionAgainst Cancer [UICC] asked me to co-chair athink tank promoting global ways ofworking, which means I have a hugeinternational cancer organisationinterested and supporting this work.Another reason is that cancer presents unique opportunities forwidespread collaboration, becauseit is a universal problem thatcrosses age groups, income levelsand countries and it covers thewhole spectrum of health services,from prevention to bereavement.The fact that cancer is so expensive to treat alsomeans that governments are prepared to investlarge sums in prevention.If we can pool our ideas on ways to tackletobacco cessation, this could have an impact, forinstance, on the one and a half billion strongpopulation of China, where tobacco use isnearing the levels we once had in WesternEurope and North America. e-World 60I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004In what fields are you trying to promote collaboration?A LEXJADAD We are concentrating initially on tobacco cessation and pain management as theseare the two main issues that are widely seen asuniversal and transcend every boundary. Tobacco is a huge problem everywhere, and thereasons for smoking are the same the world over.However, in some places we have had more success reducing tobacco consumption than in others. So rather than leaving each individualcountry, or community to work out, from scratch,ways of tackling the industry and educating youngpeople about the dangers of smoking, we want touse the Internet to gather success stories from allover the world.The UICC has already established a huge inter-national network - Global Link - that connects people interested in tobacco cessation. We arenow concentrating our efforts on creating whatwe call 'e-tool kits' to help make strategies thatworked in one country equally effective in othercultural environments. The other focus is pain management. In manycountries morphine is managed as an illegal drug,and it is still very difficult to prescribe. But somecountries, such as Colombia where I come from,have managed to solve the problem of how toprescribe morphine. So there is an opportunity towork with advocacy groups, to make them awareof the sort of regulations that have been success-fully introduced in other parts of the world. There are also many myths and cultural barriersthat deter patients from taking effective pain relief, Centre like this one Hargeysa,Somalia,are bringing Inernet access to many parts of rural Africa If we collaborate, then language is not an insuperable problem LIBA TAYLOR / CORBIS / CONTRASTOe-World I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004 61and these are surprisingly similar the world over. Some people fear pain relief might make them diesooner or turn them into zombies. Others see painas an inevitable part of cancer, or may not wish tobe seen as wimps or distract their doctors fromtreating the disease. So here is an important issuethat affects the quality of life of 75% of cancerpatients and which we can improve simply bygetting the message across that pain can bestopped effectively. Research has shown that ittakes around 10-15 years for an innovation thathas been proved successful in one environment tobe taken up and used effectively elsewhere. We can't afford this time lag in cancer, so we hope that by making these e-tool kits available we will be ableto speed up the learning and adaptation process. What is being done to bring Internet tech- nology to low-tech communities with poorinfrastructures?A LEXJADAD A lot. The United Nations has turned parts of India into a living lab for experi-ments on how to widen access to the Internet,and there are now more than 2000 different proj-ects to mobilise the community behind theseefforts. One of these is an attempt to extendInternet access from towns to the surroundingrural areas by fitting antennae on local buses.The antennae provide a wireless (Wi-Fi) connec-tion for anyone within a 300-metre radius, whichmeans that villagers will be able to sign on forshort periods, two or three times a day, as thebuses drive around their village. In some ruralareas in Africa there are now \"telecommunitycentres\" with phones, Internet access, photo-copiers, all under one roof. These initiativeshave many different purposes: to supportfarming communities, encourage small businesses, promote basic health and hygiene, bring information to schools... My question is:why not use the same resources to promotecancer prevention and disseminate informationon palliative care?This is what I mean about global collaborativeeffort - looking at what is there and workingtogether to achieve goals that go beyond whatwas originally intended. It's important toremember that we are not talking about acomputer in every home. Community workers,health workers and teachers can all act as \"infor-mation brokers,\" downloading what they need, adapting it and getting the message across in appropriate ways. Even if these communities do get Internet access, what good will it do them? Theinformation is almost entirely in alanguage they can't understand, andwritten in the contexts of economic,cultural and health environments thatdiffer radically from their own. A LEXJADAD If we collaborate, then language is not an insuperable problem. Toronto, where I work, is a good example. It is like a mini-worldwith 150 ethno-cultural communities. Here wehave a telephone service called 211, whichprovides a translation service in 100 differentlanguages, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It isexpensive, and paid for partly by the state and thephone company, and partly by charitable trusts.But it serves 3000 community groups and supportagencies in the city, so there are huge economies ofscale. None of the groups could provide thisservice alone, but through collaboration, they areable to overcome language barriers even in themost linguistically diverse city in the world.So instead of everyone starting from scratch and making the same mistakes, each community can benefit from the expertise and success of others e-World 62I CANCER WORLD ISEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 2004But the problem goes well beyond language. If we are to provide information on cancer care andprevention to Africa's Swahili-speaking communi-ties, that information will have to be relevant tothe local culture and conditions. Here too, collab-oration is everything. All it takes is for one localcommunity health team to work with us to adaptexisting materials for their own use. The materialscan then be made available via the Internet to allSwahili speaking communities of Africa, andhealth care workers or teachers in these commu-nities can then download them and use them andthen introduce their own modifications on thebasis of their own experience, and pass these onto others. So instead of everyone starting fromscratch and making the same mistakes, eachcommunity can benefit from the expertise andsuccess of others. Much of what we do at the Centre thereforefocuses on helping people take information devel-oped elsewhere and adapt it for local use. This isthe purpose of the \"e-tool kits.\" They consist ofthe raw information, strategies for adapting theinformation (how to sift out what is irrelevant andmake it locally pertinent), and options for gettingthe message across. If the material is to be postedon a website, it will need to be designed andorganised in a certain way, if it is for downloadingand photocopying for use in schools or clinics,then it will need presenting in a different way. Orone may want to use local television or radio tospread the message, in which case we have thefacilities to achieve this in Toronto, including 400actors and 1000 patients and their families fromvery diverse backgrounds who speak 52 differentlanguages between them. Does your work have any relevance for Europe? A LEXJADAD The potential for using the Internet and other information technologies in healthwork is now a major debate in both Europe andNorth America. The European School ofOncology (ESO) took the important step last yearof bringing together some of the key voices at theFirst Conference on Cancer on the Internet, heldin New York last September, and I have now beeninvited to co-chair the Second Conference, which, among other issues, will addressfostering global collaboration and promotingdigital inclusion.In Europe, the Internet may not be the mainanswer to improving access to information, at leastnot yet. In many European countries, fewer thanone in three families have access to the Internet -compared to almost nine out of ten in NorthAmerica. The mobile phone, however, is becomingalmost universal, certainly for the younger genera-tion, but increasingly for seniors as well. And it isan incredibly powerful way to communicate -mobile phones today can send and receive e-mailsand text messages, and can be used to watch tele-vision programmes and videoclips.We wish to help local organisations develop ways ofexploiting mobile phones - perhaps in conjunctionwith the Internet - to disseminate informationabout cancer treatment and prevention. The key isfinding out how people wish to receive the infor-mation. Do they want audiovisual clips? Wouldthey prefer text - large type or small? Everything wedo is subjected to \"usability\" tests to ensure theservice will be easy to use. At what point will you know whether e- collaboration can produce the healthbenefits you hope for?A LEXJADAD We've achieved a great deal in a short period of time. Through the UICC we haveaccess to hundreds of organisations working inthe area of cancer, tobacco cessation and pain,and we have set up the infrastructure to link themtogether. We have ESO in Europe, we are collaborating with six regional Health Ministriesin Spain, one of which wants to work with us todevelop a telehealth initiative for North Africaand Latin America. India is likely to take the leadon pain management tool kits. We need to think big, act small and deliverquickly. Let's try it - what did we learn? Makesome changes - what did we learn? And hopefullyafter four or five cycles of doing and learning, wewill have the basis for something effective thatcan be used by groups all over the world to makea real difference.
