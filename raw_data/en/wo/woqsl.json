There is, however, another option. Alternative medicine is sometimes considered the oldest medicine in the world. Alternative medicine envelops the concept of seeking out non-traditional ways to deal with day-to-day health issues. This type of medicine looks beyond taking medication. People look to use alternative medicine for two main reasons. The first is because of the idea that taking medications can potentially lead to unhealthy results such as dependencies and side effects. The second is because of the natural curiosity of man to find better methods to heal. Alternative medicine encompasses many different therapies, such as hypnosis, color therapy, yoga, meditation, herbal remedies, vitamin therapy, and many more. The main focus of alternative medicine is that life is a combination of parts that includes more than the treatment of disease. There is a definite focus on living life well, happily, and with purpose. It is believed that this is an essential part of healthy living. This guide will explore the many different components of alternative medicine, and how it can help you. Consider using the ideas captured here next time you feel ill to begin feeling better naturally. 5 Chapter 1 Alternative Medicine & Its History Treatments Beyond Conventional When most people get sick, they look to conventional methods of medical treatment for relief and healing. There are alternative methods to treatment that are becoming increasingly popular. What treatments are considered \"conventional?\" Prescription medication, traditional surgery, and computerized scientific testing are three examples of conventional medicine. Most physicians support conventional medicine in their practices, so when seeing a doctor, it is highly likely you will be advised to follow conventional medical advice. The decision to use conventional medicine should be made by the patient and doctor on a case by case basis. An alteration to the type of treatment is sometimes all that is needed to feel better. Alternative treatments include: Herbal remedies Massage Meditation Acupuncture Many more! Patients will often find themselves turning to alternative methods of treatment when conventional methods are ineffective or a medical problem has been 6 deemed untreatable. Alternative treatments are designed to not only aid in pain relief, but also reduce stress and tension that can worsen chronic pain. Alternative methods of treatment focus on the whole person; body and soul. Convention methods strictly focus on the physical problems alone. For alternative methods to be effective, the patient must be motivated and believe in the alternative treatment's ability to work. Of course, any serious, life-threatening health problem should blend conventional and alternative methods for a comprehensive approach. Be sure to consult with your doctor to avoid complications. If planned well, you can take advantage of best of both types of medicine for a life that is comfortable and enjoyable. Alternative Medicine History & Theory Thousands of years ago, all medicine was \"alternative medicine.\" Before modern science, healers would consider the full picture - emotional, physical, and spiritual - before healing a sick person. This is one of the main differences between modern conventional medicine and alternative medicine. Alternative medicine does not look for the instant cure for the physical problem, rather is looks more at a long-term solution that includes the whole self. Just a few centuries ago in Europe there were two types of healers; folk healers that used old tried-and-true methods, and professional physicians. The lower classes did not have the money to pay for the professional physicians, but they used the folk healers and it worked. In North America, philosophy and religion were often used to help folk healers provide holistic treatments. The conventional medicine that we have today has evolved from the days of folk healers and alternative medicine. Many conventional physicians support different 7 types of holistic treatments in the overall wellness plan for their patients. The reason that alternative medicine has stood the test of time is because it works! Ancient Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) includes acupuncture, Qigong, herbal treatments, deep massage, and more. More than 25% of the world's population practices TCM. Several reputable groups, such as the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Health, find traditional Chinese medicine to be a viable alternative to contemporary medicine. Many parts of TCM began well over 3,000 years ago in China. The focus of TCM is Qi (pronounced \"Chee\"), which is the body's energy that connects it to the world around us. It is believed that all disorders and bodily problems are caused by the misalignment of Qi. Acupuncture is one of the most widely recognized methods of bringing the Qi into alignment. Herbal remedies are popular in traditional Chinese medicine. They are used to relax and calm the patient's emotions to avoid depression, and provide a more positive outlook on the illness. This helps tremendously in the healing process. Ginseng and herbal green tea are the most popular herbal remedies in China. Exercise, mainly Qigong (pronounce \"Chee Kung\"), is also an important part of traditional Chinese medicine. Qigong involves posture, meditation, and slow, calculated body movements. Tibetan Medicine Tibetan Medicine is almost solely based on herbal remedies, and has been around for over 2,500 years. It is called \"gSoba Rig-pa\". Tibetans mostly live in 8 India because they have been in exile since the late 1950's. They practice Tibetan Buddhism. There is a Tibetan Medical Institute in Northern India, where doctors studying Tibetan medicine attend for 7 years before earning a degree. The underlying belief in Tibetan medicine is that all illnesses are caused by poisonous thinking which include dread, denial, and want. This concept ties to the principles of Buddhist philosophy. The three poisonous thoughts are believed to be caused by poor diet, inappropriate behavior, and the imbalance of time and season. This concept is more complicated than this, but this simplification will give a general sense of it. Cures are linked to all systems of the body working together. The elimination of sweat, feces and urine contributes to this harmony. Similar to the Chinese \"Qi\", the Tibetans have the Rlung, which is the overall life force that connects us to the universe. Rlung has five types: 1. Centered in the brain. Life grasping - controls breathing, intellect, sneezing and swallowing. 2. Centered in the chest. Upward moving - controls verbal ability and stamina. 3. Centered in the heart. All pervading - controls all movement like that of the orifices of the body and walking. 4. Centered in the stomach. Fire accompanying - controls digestion and metabolism. 5. Centered in the rectum. Downward cleansing - controls everything that is expelled from the body, such as babies, menstrual blood or semen. 9 Tibetan medicine usually handles sickness diagnosis by analysis of the tongue and urine. The spiritual element is also at play in Tibetan medicine, with much attention spent focusing on the type and temperament of spirits in the body. American Indian Medicine (aka Native American Medicine) North American Indian tribes have been practicing medicine for what some claim to be over 40,000 years. The medical information and techniques are handed down from generation to generation; ensure the longevity of the practice. Some remedies are tribe-specific, although all tribal medicine is called Native American Medicine, collectively. Native Americans believe that man is one with nature and that the elements provide strength and can cure disease. It is fascinating to note that at the same time that Native American medicine was being practiced in North America, Traditional Chinese Medicine was being practiced a half a world away. Ayurveda (medicine practiced in India), was also practiced at this time, and will be covered next. All of these traditional medical practices are based on the same fundamental belief that a person's lifestyle and environment should be taken into consideration before choosing a treatment path. There are subtle differences between the practices that are specific to the region. Native American medicine recognizes a purification procedure involving herbal smoke before and after treatment. Treatments include the use of sage and cedar smoke to repel negative energy. Negative energy is considered the pain released by someone who is ill, or the pain that the healer takes on themselves from their patients. Therapeutic touch is used. Singing, chanting, drums and rattles accompany the healing during the session. Ayurvedic Medicine 10 Ayurvedic Medicine is practiced in India, and focuses on natural healing. Practitioners believe that it is important for the body to be balanced, and all medicines are based on vegetables and minerals, with the active ingredients from plant alkaloids. In Ayurvedic Medicine there is the belief that there are three elements in the body, called Kapha, Pitta, and Vata, that cause disease. 1. Kapha: This energy is caused by the lack of stabilizing the balance in the body. These are commonly called viruses by Westerners. 2. Pitta: This energy supports vision, temperature, hunger, thirst, intelligence, and happiness. When out of alignment, the outcomes include weight fluctuation, dehydration, depression, digestive issues, and apathy. 3. Vata: This energy keeps the overall balance between the earth, sky and world around us in check with ourselves. If it falls out of balance, sickness is invited in. Disease is called Vyaadhi, and it is treated by focusing on the imbalance of elements. 100% Proven Method for Weight Loss with Natural Ingredients. You deserves the blessings of nature and attain the best possible healthy life. 11 Chapter 2 Alternative Treatment Options Homeopathy Treatments Homeopathy is defined as an organic system of medicine that is based on three main ideas: 1. Like cures like 2. Minimal dosing 3. One time remedies Alternative medicine traditionally has the least amount of \"active\" ingredient possible, with the concept of using one single remedy irregardless of how many symptoms are presenting. Homeopathy focuses on the least amount of treatments for better health. There are several reasons why homeopathy is the second most popular form of medicine (after conventional medicine). The most popular reasons are: It is extremely natural and safe The results are permanent It is effective You can take most homeopathic medicines along with conventional medicine without side effects It is non-addictive Homeopathy is a precise science, which is why it sometimes takes longer to find exactly the right medicine for your illness. Alternative medicine spends time 12 asking questions about symptoms and the root cause of the illness in an effort to make a clear diagnosis for the problem, and treat it effectively. Herbal Remedies Nature provides many cures and treatments for ailments of all kinds. Each region has its own native plants that are used in alternative medicine. When buying herbs for medicinal purposes, it is suggested that you use herbs from an herbal shop. Herb strength varies depending on the way in which they are grown, so until you are familiar with growing techniques for medicinal herbs, purchasing from a professional is recommended. The following list provides herbal cures to common ailments: Acne and skin blemishes. Wash your face and rub a clove of garlic that has been cut in half. Or, mix lavender with witch hazel at a 1:10 ratio. Tea tree oil can be substituted in place of the lavender. Anxiety and stress. Lavender pure essential oil soaked onto a cotton cloth, heated, and folded into a compress. Apply to head or neck. Bruises and contusions. Boil hyssop flowers and leaves into a tincture. Filter liquid, and soak a cotton compress. Apply to bruised area by applying pressure. The hyssop, heat and pressure combination will reduce the bruise. Burns. Minor burns can be treated with comfrey or aloe juice. Simply rub aloe juice into burned area. Comfrey can be crushed into a fine powder, mixed with 13 equal parts of melted beeswax, and added to vegetable oil. Simmer over low heat for 20 minutes, and then strain mixture. Warts. Either use a cut piece of garlic, placed directly on the wart or, for a less odorous cure, try dandelion juice applied repeatedly throughout the day. Herbal Teas An age old remedy, herbal teas are used to soothe and relive pain and stress. Many teas are actually a tincture rather than a tea. A tincture is a thicker tea that is herb-dense and is infused instead of steeped. The following list is a list of conditions and herbal tea remedies: Anemia. Drink a tincture made from boiled stinging nettle leaves. Arthritis. Drink a tincture of devil's claw, juniper, birch, or celery seed (not the type on your spice rack). Chemotherapy side effects. Drink a tincture of Siberian ginseng root. It soothes the insides and relieves fatigue. Colic in babies. Add less than 10 drops of dill and fennel tincture to their bottle. Constipation. Drink a liter of rhubarb root per day. 14 Cough. Drink a tea made from garlic bulbs and ribwort leaves. Depression. Drink a tincture daily made from the ground up oat plant and St. John's wart flowers. Fever. Drink a hot tea made of lemon balm, yarrow, and ginger. Gas. Drink a tea made of caraway, fennel, ginger, and peppermint. Flu symptoms. Drink a tincture made of Echinacea, yarrow, and catnip. Vitamins & Minerals Taking a vitamin supplement is not a substitution for eating healthfully. However, it does serve as insurance to be certain that you are getting all of the vitamins and minerals that your body needs. Vitamins are essential to the optimized functioning of your body. Without sufficient vitamins, for example, your blood will not clot. You need vitamins to fight colds, and boost your immune system. It is best to take a homeopathic test to determine the vitamins that you need. This will avoid a dangerous overdose. Then you can take the vitamins you need individually, as needed, and avoid a multi-vitamin, which is chockfull of fillers. This method will save you money, too. Bee Therapy (aka Apitherapy) 15 The practice of Apitherapy is the use of bee stings, bee pollen, propolis, royal jelly, and honey to treat a variety of aliments. While there has not been extensive testing in the scientific world to validate the claims of apitherapists, history proves that the treatments provide relief. There are five honeybee products that are used in apitherapy: 1. Venom: A practitioner will aid the patient in injecting or being stung by bees in the affected area. The venom is used to provide relief for conditions such as tendonitis, Multiple Sclerosis, and degenerative bone disease. It works because the venom is a natural anti-inflammatory which is more potent then others available to conventional medicine such as hydrocortisone. You must get tested to be certain that you are not allergic to beestings prior to exposing yourself to bee venom. 2. Pollen: A natural energy supplement that is also used as a seasonal allergy aid. It is also believed to slow down the development of wrinkles. 3. Raw Honey: A source of quick energy, raw honey is used for many cures. It can even be used as a salve on top of an open wound to avoid the spread of bacteria. 4. Royal Jelly: Is the milky white substance that the worker bees produce to feed the queen. While unsubstantiated, this substance is used as a beauty aid and is believed to help lower cholesterol. 5. Propolis: Is the glue used to keep the hives together and make repairs. Propolis is made from the sap of poplar and conifer trees. It is used to make lip balm and salves, and is considered to be an antioxidant. Iridology 16 Iridology is name for the practice of determining a person's toxicity based on the color of their iris. This concept goes back to Sweden and Hungary where physicians used it to gauge disease in their patients. For centuries, famous physicians and scientists, all the way back to the Greek physician Hippocrates, have found the people with injuries get black marks across the iris of their eye. These marks later disappear as the person's ailments heal. In today's world, iridology is used as a preventative measure to gauge if there is a change in a person's health. It is unfortunate that iridology cannot be used to identify a specific disease. The way in which iridology is practiced today is that the colored part of the eye (the iris) is carefully photographed using a strong camera lens. It is painless, and it takes about an hour to complete. The photos are then enlarged, and a trained professional iridologist studies it for signs of possible illness. Even conventional doctors use the eyes as an early warning sign of bad things going on inside of the body. This study is just the more focused analysis of the iris when looking for signs of degenerative health issues. Meditation in Healing Meditation is a skill that is learned. Once you know how to do it properly, it can be used to greatly improve your quality of life and health. The benefits of meditation are an increased level of energy, a more positive attitude, a better immune health, better sleep quality, and the slowing of the aging process. To take advantage of the maximum benefit, meditate for at least 20 minutes per day prior to bedtime. 17 Follow these steps for meditating. First, sit down and get comfortable in a quiet room. Keep your back and neck straight, and clear your mind so that you are focusing on the present moment. Then become aware of your breathing. Breathe in and out of your mouth, and pay attention to your stomach rising and falling. If thoughts come into your head, acknowledge them and let the pass through your mind. Remain conscious of your breathing and relax. If your thoughts carry you away, don't get frustrated. Simply return back to focusing on your breathing. When your time meditating is finished, become aware of your surroundings and stand up slowly. Meditation is a wonderful way to instantly relax yourself and reenter your being. It is the perfect supplement to any treatment, both alternative and contemporary. This deep relaxation technique will help remove stress and anxiety from life. Reduced stress can only help healing. Tai Chi & Yoga Tai Chi is a very gentle form of exercise that anyone can do. Since most people spend most of their time sitting, it is imperative that regular exercise become a part of their daily routine. Tai Chi can become that daily movement. Exercise helps by improving circulatory function, reducing headache tension, lowering blood pressure, and eliminating chronic back and neck pain. Tai Chi is a series of movements and stretches that anyone can do from any position, even sitting. The exercise will improve posture, stamina, and flexibility. Movements in Tai Chi are slow and deliberate, and easy to learn. Attending a class is the best way to learn Tai Chi.

It is not difficult, but you do have to want to learn about it. The main goal of yoga is to create a balanced relationship between you physical and mental health. Yoga is a way of life that is carried throughout the day, not just while in yoga class. Yoga creates an awareness of yourself and your day to day life. This is a drastic change to many people who often live on autopilot. You can decide how you want to use yoga, for its basic purpose of bringing together mind and body, or as more of a strenuous activity for exercise purposes. In yoga, it is best to start out at the lowest level possible and work your way up as you develop strength and understanding. Just like most other things, it is important to know the foundational concepts before branching out into more difficult territory, You can take instructor-led classes, or learn at home through the wide variety of DVDs. Birkram Yoga Birkram yoga is also known as \"hot yoga\", mainly because it is practiced in a space that has been heated to over 115 degrees. Hot yoga mainly focuses on stretches and balance. It also is filled with moves that create pressure in the body that blocks circulation. By going through the movements, the constant build up of pressure created by stretching are then released, providing a rush of blood through the veins. This is believed to clean them out. There are 26 poses in hot yoga. The purpose for the hot environment in Birkram yoga is the warmth warms the body's muscles and tendons which aids in flexibility. 19 There are a few tips for people considering this type of yoga. First, because it is practiced in a hot room, you will sweat a lot. It is best to wear appropriate light clothing. It is also a good idea to drink plenty of water prior to your session. Hatha Yoga The main focus of Hatha yoga is breathing, meditation, and posture. The practice of this form of yoga is perfect for people that are new to it. Hatha yoga has more of a strong emphasis on the mental component of meditation, mixed in with yoga. Karma Yoga The Karma form of yoga pulls together the spiritual and physical worlds. The fundamentals of Karma yoga are based in the Hindu philosophy and religion. It combines two competing philosophies in the world; from the West - that life should be pleasure based, and from the East - that life should be lived for knowledge. Both theories are blended in karma. Your karma growth is dependant on how you live your life. Bad karma comes from living your life for the purpose of money, wealth, and material possessions. Good karma comes from living your life for happiness and love. Karma yoga helps you focus on your life as you learn about you life goals, and helps guide you in the right direction.

Kinesiology Professionals test the various muscles throughout the body to determine areas that are not balanced properly, and then restore balance by using a variety of techniques. 2.

By applying gentle pressure to the head, the rhythm of the cranioscaral system can be evaluated and in some ways manipulated. This improves the flow and function of the central nervous system. This treatment is used in alternative medicine as a preventative measure. Professional craniosacral therapy practitioners believe they can locate and release energy cysts by unblocking them and realigning the neck. Acupuncture In acupuncture, thin needles are inserted into the skin to draw nerve stimulation at pinpointed locations around the body.

Fire, earth, air, and water, and the additional \"metal\", are represented inside the home by the selection of lighting, scents, sounds, and the placement of furniture and fixtures. The underlying concept is that the qi, or life force, must be able to move freely in a room. Therefore, the location of furniture, for example, is important. Chiropractics Chiropractics is an alternative medicinal practice that is now considered conventional. The main theory behind chiropractics is that the vertebrate of the spine is not in alignment. It is believed that this misalignment causes many diseases and disorders throughout the body. Chiropractors use pressure to realign and adjust the spine. Most chiropractors also look at the whole picture - stress, lifestyle choices, and overall health - when recommending treatment. Chiropractors have been known to heal a wide range of medical problems through their work on patient's backs. Asthma, migraines, arthritis and more issues can all be positively impacted. This treatment is safe and usually inexpensive. It is non-evasive. Going to a chiropractor will certainly require regular visits because your issues will not be fully treated in just one session. 25 Biofeedback Biofeedback is a tool used to gauge internal function, then determine treatment, and then gauge if treatment is working properly. Similar to a thermometer or scale to measure the body weight or if there is a fever, biofeedback is garnered through tools. The body function that it is measuring is activity that one cannot voluntarily control, such as blood pressure and brain wavelengths. The main recommendation in alternative health for biofeedback is usually relaxation. This reduces the heart rate, calms the brain, and greatly impacts the affected parts of the body. Using Alternative Medicine in Children Sometimes conventional treatments are not an option for children. One example of when alternative medicines are a viable option for children is when they refuse to take their over-the-counter medication.

Relaxation techniques and massage 26 This can help kids with asthma deal with constricting airways. Massage can help relax the stress surround asthma as well.
