(EPM), on behalf of Hunter Roberts Construction Group and the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) has prepared this Si te Characterization Work Plan at the request of the New York State Department of Environmen tal Conservation (NYS DEC) to further investigate the property proposed for the new Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Paratransit Facility, located on Commerce Avenue, Bronx, New York (Figure 1 - Project Site Location). The site is currently vacant and occupies an approximate 94,958 square-foot portion of Block 3838, Lot 60. The Department of Housing, Preservation and Development currently has jurisdiction ove r Block 3838, Lot 60. The subject of this Work Plan (\"the site\") is the approximate 94,958 square-foot portion of Lot 60 that is proposed for development of the MTA Paratr ansit Facility. The remaining portion of Lot 60 is not proposed as part of the subjec t development, and reportedly will remain in its current commercial use. There are curr ently no plans to subdivide Lot 60 into separate legal lots after construction of the Pa ratransit Facility. The survey plot of the entire Lot 60 is included in Appendix A. Fi gure 2 indicates the area of Lot 60 that is the subject of this Work Plan (the site). Pr ior to beginning the i nvestigation, the site boundaries will be surveyed and physically deli neated with stakes and fencing to clearly separate the portion of Lot 60 th at is being investigated from the portion that is not being investigated. The proposed Paratransit Facility w ill comprise an approximate 5,000 square- foot building that will include a traini ng room, administrative offices, and other back of house areas, as well as parking for appr oximately 150 Paratran sit vehicles. The remainder of the site will be completed as paved parking, with small planting areas possible within the sidewalk area al ong Commerce Avenue. Preliminary site redevelopment plans are provided as Appendix A. It is expected that the new facility will serve to receive new vehicles from manufacturers and retired vehicles from private operators for temporary storage onsite until disbursed to new operators/owners, to perform asset recovery of selected vehicle equipment, and to train drivers and maintainers in the operation and maintenance of the vehicles. A Phase I Environmental Site Assessmen t and a Phase II Environmental Site Investigation were completed at the site in 2013 on behalf of NY CEDC. The Phase II Investigation identified site soils to be imp acted primarily with metals and semi-volatile 2 organic compounds (SVOCs), and soil va por impacted with VOCs including tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethen e (TCE). Groundwater samples collected from temporary piezometers during the Phas e II Investigation contained metals and SVOCs above NYSDEC Class GA groundwater standards/guidance values. A Remedial Action Plan (RAP), dated April 21, 2014, was prepared based on the findings of the 2013 Phase II Investigation to describe procedures for mitigating hazardous material impacts during construction and operation of the Paratransit Facility. The primary components of the RAP are instal lation of a pavement cap over existing site soils, and installation of a sub-slab depressu rization system beneat h the new building to vent subsurface vapors. The RAP was accepte d by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP) in a letter dated May 23, 2014. Subsequent to approval of the RAP, MTA requested that NYSDEC provide input and oversight concerning site mitigation requirements. The main objectives of this proposed investiga tion are to further char acterize onsite soil, groundwater, and soil vapor c onditions; to investigate soil vapor and groundwater conditions offsite along Commerce Avenue; and, to determine surface aquifer flow patterns at the site. 1.2 Site History 1.2.1 Records Search EPM completed a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) for the project site, the results of which are provided in the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Report, Commerce Avenue, Bronx, NY, May 16, 2013 . According to hist oric Sanborn Maps, the site was undeveloped until as early as 1977, when the southern third was occupied by an automotive junk yard. The northern two-thir ds of the property was used as a truck storage yard as early as 1981. The project si te is also listed with NYSDEC as having a closed-status hazardous material spill reportedl y associated with a scrap metal dealer improperly storing vehicles on the project site which lead to gasoli ne leaking onto the site. A subsequent site inspection by NYSD EC in August 2014 resulted in issuance of Active Spill Number 1405821 due to oil being observed on the ground surface in an area where five gallon containers of waste oil were dumped on the site. The NYSDEC Spill Report states that it appeared the waste oil containers were recently dumped at the si te. The areas adjacent to the project site have hi storically been occupied by commercial and industrial uses including bulk fu el and coal storage, metal wo rks, and automotive repair. An area to the southwest of the project s ite was once occupied by a Manufactured Gas Plant as Bronx Gas and Electric, and a bulk fuel storage fac ility as Cirillo Brothers 3 Petroleum Company. This former MGP site is listed as a New York State Brownfield Site, a Major Oil Storage Facility, and Hazardous Material Spill site. A prior Phase I ESA for the project site completed by Metcalf & Eddy in 2004 was reviewed. During the 2004 site inspection, evidence was obser ved of petroleum stained soils, abandoned vehicles, a tanke r trailer, containe rs of identifiable hazardous materials and petroleum products and several containers of unidentifiable material. It is suspected that illegal dumping may also have o ccurred at the site over the years. EPM's 2013 Phase I ESA included a review of prior soil and groundwat er investigations performed at the project site by TRC Corpor ation in 2002 and GEI Consultants in 2005. These prior investigat ions identified volatile organi c compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and metals in soil samples collected from the site above guidan ce values. VOCs and metals were detected in onsite groundwater samples, however only iron, manganese, and magnesium were found in concentrations exceeding NYSDEC Class GA values. A prior soil vapor sample collected by GEI in 2005 in the vicinity of the proposed Paratransit Training Structure contained concentrations of refrigerants and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in excess of their onsite ambient concentrati ons, including Freon 11 and 12, Phase II Site Investigation EPM collected soil, groundwater, and soil vapo r samples from the project site in June 2013 for laboratory analysis from a combinati on of Geoprobe soil borings and test pits. The findings are detailed in the Site Investigati on Findings Report, Proposed MTA Paratransit Training Facil ity, July 12, 2013, EPM, Inc. The prior sampling locations and summary tables of the laboratory results are provided as Appendix B . Existing Soil Conditions Soils encountered in the borings and test pits generally consisted of urban fill with grey to dark brown sand and silt, and included glas s, brick, masonry, plastic, textile, and automotive parts. SVOCs and metals were found at concentrations exceeding NYSDEC Part 375 Commercial Soil Cleanup Objectives (SCOs) in the majority of soil samples collected from the project site. PCBs, pe sticides, and the VOCs 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and mixed xylenes were detected at concen trations exceeding Part 375 Unrestricted SCOs. 4 Existing Groundwater Conditions SVOCs and metals were detected in the ons ite groundwater samples that were collected from temporary piezometers at concentra tions above NYSDEC Cl ass GA values. No VOCs were detected in onsite groundwater above Class GA values, which is consistent with the findings of the prior groundwater sa mpling performed at th e site discussed in section 1.2.1. Existing Soil Vapor Conditions The VOCs trichloroethene (TCE) and tetrachloroethene (PCE) were detected in soil vapor sample SV2 at concentrations of 240 micrograms per cubic meter ( g/m3) and 28,000 g/m3, respectively. PCE was also de tected at a concentration of 239 g/m 3 in sample SV1. Methane was not detected in any of the soil gas samples above the lower explosive level for methane of 50,000 ppmv. 5 2.0 INVESTIGATION METHODS The following sections describe the proposed methods to further investigate conditions on the site and offsite along Commerce Avenue. 2.1 Objectives The objectives of this investigation are to further characterize onsite soil, groundwater, and soil vapor conditions; to investigate so il vapor and groundwater conditions offsite along Commerce Avenue; and, to determine over burden aquifer flow patterns. Shallow groundwater is expected to flow towards the east beneath the project site based on the proximity to Westchester Creek. The results of the investigati on will be used to identify a ppropriate mitigation measures to protect future users of the new Para transit Facility from exposure to hazardous materials. The results will also be used to evaluate th e likelihood of any onsite or offsite sources of groundwater or soil vapor impacts. 2.1.1 Data Quality Objectives The data collected during the investigation will be utilized to provide information to satisfy the following Data Qu ality Objectives (DQOs): Further delineate soil, groundwater, and soil vapor conditions within the boundaries of the project site; Identify conditions in offsite soil va por and offsite groundwater along Commerce Avenue; and, Determine groundwater flow patterns in the immediate vicinity of the site. The data will be evaluated as follows: Onsite data will be used to determine if the mitigation measures contained in the existing RAP are sufficient for construction of the proposed Paratr ansit Facility; Offsite and onsite data will be evalua ted in the context of groundwater flow patterns to determine the likelihood of any ons ite or offsite contaminant sources. 6 2.2 Standards, Criteria and Guidance Values Soil results will be compared to NYSDEC Part 375 Remedial Program Soil Cleanup Objectives (SCOs). Based on the proposed futu re use of the site as an MTA Paratransit Facility, achievement of Part 375 Commercia l SCOs is the proposed surface soil cleanup goal for the site. The existing RAP assumes that construction of the new Paratransit Facility will include capping of the entire development area based on the detection of metals and SVOCs above Commercial SCOs in onsite soil samples. Groundwater results will be compared to NYSDEC Division of Water Technical and Operational Guidance Series (1.1.1) Ambien t Water Quality Standards and Guidance Values and Groundwater Effluent Limita tions (Class GA), June 1998. Groundwater beneath the site is not propos ed for potable use and strict adherence to the Class GA criteria may not be applicable. The soil vapor sample results will be compared to the results of site-specific background air samples. Two background air samples w ill be collected in summa canisters for a duration of two hours on the same day the subsurface vapor samples are collected. The canisters for the background samples will be pl aced approximately 1 to 2 feet above the ground surface. The soil vapor sample results wi ll be evaluated to deli neate the extent of soil vapor impacts at the site, and to determin e the potential for future vapor intrusion into the proposed building. 2.3 Installation of Soil Borings, Moni toring Wells and Soil Vapor Implants Clearing and grubbing of the site will be performed prior to initiating the field investigation. A survey of the site boundaries will al so be performed by a NYS Licensed Surveyor prior to initiating the fiel d investigation. The boundaries of the site will be physically demarcated with stakes a nd fencing to clearly separate the portion of Lot 60 that is being investigated (the site) from the portion of Lot 60 that is not included in the investigation. The proposed locations of the additional Geoprobe soil bori ngs, groundwater monitoring wells, and soil vapor sampling implants are provided on Figure 2 - Sample Location Plan. The soil boring and monitoring well locations will be surveyed by a NYS Licensed Surveyor for placement on a site plan. Field observations and measurements will be recorded on logs to be included in the findings report. 7 2.3.1 Soil Borings Additional soil delineation will be conducted ac ross the site in general, and specifically around prior sample location B2 due to the disc overy of elevated lead in soil samples collected from this boring. A Geoprobe\u00ae with direct push technology will be used to advance ten soil borings on the pr oject site. The borings will be advanced to depths that encounter the groundwater table or to 15 feet below grade, whichever is greatest. Groundwater is located approximately 8 to 11 f eet below grade at the site. 2.3.2 Groundwater Monitoring Wells A hollow stem auger drill will be used to in stall five permanent groundwater monitoring wells on the project site, and to install three permanent wells to the northwest of the site within the sidewalk along Commerce Avenue. The wells will be constructed with 2-inch diameter 10-foot long 0.02 slot screens to br acket the ground water table (half of the screen will be submerged). The wells will be installed to approximately 5 feet below the water surface, with groundwat er expected at approximately 8 to 11 feet below grade across the site. The wells will be gravel pack ed from one foot below the screen to one foot above the screen with Morie #2 gravel pack. A fine sand seal will be placed above the gravel pack and a 2-foot bentonite seal wi ll be placed above the sand seal. The wells will be grouted from the bentonite seal to grade with a cement grout. The onsite wells will be finished with stick-up metal protect ive casings and locking caps. The offsite wells within the public sidewalk will be finish ed at grade with 8-inch diameter bolt down manholes. The wells will then be develope d using surge and pump techniques by the drilling contractor. 2.3.3 Temporary Soil Vapor Implants Three temporary soil vapor implant will be installed onsite, and three temporary soil vapor sampling implants will be installed o ffsite within the sidewalk along Commerce Avenue. One ambient surface air sample will al so be collected. A Geoprobe will be used to advance the vapor implants as described in Section 2.5.3. 2.4 Investigative Derived Waste Drill cuttings and well development water generated during installation of the offsite wells, along with all decontamination liqui ds/solids, and contaminated personal protective equipment will be collected in USDOT-approved 55-gallon drums and temporarily stored onsite pending waste classi fication testing and transport to a permitted disposal facility. Excess drill cuttings from the onsite borings will be returned to the 8 borings they originated from unless gross signs of contamin ation are observed, in which case the cuttings will be drummed for offsite disposal. Likewise, well development water from the onsite wells will be discharged to the unpaved land surface of the site unless contamination is observed, in which case the liqui ds will be drummed for offsite disposal. 2.5 Sample Collection and Analysis The following sections summarize the field samp le collection procedures to be used. Detailed field sampling and laboratory analys is protocols are provided in the Sampling and Analysis Project Plan (SAPP) provided as Appendix C . The quality assurance/quality control methods to be used to ensure reliable accu rate data are detailed in the Quality Assurance Proj ect Plan (QAPP) provide as Appendix D . Field activities will be conducted in accordance with the Health and Safety Plan provided as Appendix E. 2.5.1 Soil Soil samples from the ten Geoprobe borings will be continuously field screened from ground surface to the bori ng termination depth. The cores w ill be collected in 5-foot long dedicated acetate liners. The soil will be fi eld screened with a fr eshly calibrated photo- ionization detector (PID) for indications of organic vapors, and for visual or odor evidence of contamination. Three soil samples will be collected for laboratory analysis from each boring. A soil sample will be collected from each boring for lab analysis from the 0 to 2-foot depth, a second soil sample will be collected from each boring from the 2- foot interval at the boring terminus, and a third sample will be collected from a location with the greatest field evidence of contamina tion from between the top 2 feet of soil and the bottom of the boring. Soil samples will be prepared for the laboratory by placing the selected interval into a stainless steel mixing bowl, sepa rating it into quarters, and placing an equa l portion of each quarter into the proper laboratory provide d containers. To minimize volatilization, soil samples collected for VOC an alysis will not be composited in this manner, but rather will consist of discreet samples collected from locations with the greatest PID readings or other evidence of VOC impacts. The initial 24 inches of soil will be field screened for indications of VOCs at each boring. A di screet sample will be collected for VOC analysis from each boring from the location wi th the greatest evidence of impact from the upper 24 inches of soil, or from the upper 2 inches if no evidence of impacts are observed. The soil samples will be analyzed for Target Compound List (TCL) Volatile Organic Compounds+10 TICs (VOCs by Me thod 8260); TCL Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds+20 TICs (TCL SVOCs by Method 8270); PCBs by Method 8082, Pesticides 9 by Method 8081, and Target Analyte List (TAL) metals by methods 6010/7000. The samples will be collected, stored, shipped, and analyzed according to the procedures detailed in the attached SAPP and QAPP. Th e QAPP contains a summary of the types of samples, analytical methods, and quality a ssurance samples that will be collected and analyzed. 2.5.2 Groundwater After waiting a minimum of one week after well development, the six new wells will be measured for depth to water and free produc t with an electronic interface probe. After these measurements are recorded, the wells wi ll be purged and sampled with a low flow method bladder pump utilizing USEPA lo w-flow sampling pr ocedures. Field measurements will be recorded during purging for pH, temperature, specific conductance, turbidity, reduction-oxidation po tential, and dissolved oxyge n until these parameters stabilize indicating that the well contains a representati ve groundwater sample. The purge volumes and chemistry measurements will be recorded on Low Flow Purge and Sampling Logs, an example of which is incl uded with the SAPP in Appendix C. One round of groundwater samples will be collected from the eight wells for laboratory analysis of TCL VOCs+10, SVOCs+20, PCBs , Pesticides, and TAL Metals (total unfiltered). 2.5.3 Soil Vapor A Geoprobe will be used to advance 1.5-inch outer diameter rods with expendable vapor sampling points to a targeted sampling depth of six feet below grade. If groundwater is encountered at deeper than expected dept hs, a field decision will be made regarding placing the vapor probe deeper if possible. Cu rrent soil data for the site does not indicate a significant onsite source of VOCs in soil ; however, the Geoprobe soil sampling will be performed prior to the soil vapo r sampling so that the soil va por locations can be adjusted to suspected source locations if identified. The soil vapor samples will be collected in 6-liter summa canisters with a sampling duration of at least 2 hours. A 12-inch long stainless st eel vapor sampling implant will be inserted through the rod such that it is positioned at the bottom of the borehole. Dedicated Teflon tubing will be attached to the disposable implant. The annular space around the screen implant will be backfilled w ith clean #1 sand to two feet above the implant screen. A bentonite seal will be placed above the sand extending to ground surface. The sample tubing will then be connected to a T connector 3-way valve apparatus with one end of the T connector a ttached to a vacuum pump and the other end attached to a batch certified summa canister with calibrated flow controller. The tubing 10 will be purged at least approximately two vol umes with a Gillian vacuum pump set at a flow rate of 0.2 liters per minute. A tracer gas (helium) will be used to verify that ambient air does not dilute the soil gas sample being collected. The gas will be used to enrich the atmosphere where the sample tubing meets the ground surface to test the bore hole seal and confirm that ambient air is not entering the sample. A 5-gallon bucket will be placed over the borehole and the tracer gas pumped into the bucket. A tedlar bag will be connected to the Gillian pump and filled with the purge gas as the helium is added to th e bucket. Both the purge gas from the sample tubing and the helium enrich ed air in the bucket will be measured for helium with a Gas Check 3000 meter. If the tracer gas screening i ndicates the rate of helium detected in the sample tubing is greater than 20 percent of the helium detected in the bucket, the seals around the sampling appa ratus will be reset and purged again until the tracer gas is no longer present at levels greater than 20 percent of the enriched air within the bucket. After the purge and tracer gas verification pr ocedures, the valve leading to the pump will be shut, the pump shut off, and the soil vapor then directed to the summa canister for collection of the sample. The flow controller on the summa canister wi ll be set to a flow rate of 0.2 liters per minute or lower, and th e soil vapor sample colle cted for a duration of 30 minutes. After the sample is collected, the borehole will be backfilled with clean sand, a bentonite seal, and grouted to the land surface. The summa canisters will then be shipped to the laboratory for analysis of VOCs by EPA Method TO-15. The purge data for each sample location will be recorded on the Soil Va por Sampling Field Data Logs, with an example of this field log prov ided in the SAPP in Appendix C. 2.6 Field Decontamination Procedures All non-disposable sampling equipment such as down-hole drilling equipment, stainless steel mixing bowls, trowels, spoons, etc. will be decontaminated prior to initial use, between sample locations, and prior to leaving the site as follows: 1. Scrub equipment with brush and non-phos phate detergent so lution (Alconox); 2. Rinse with potable water; 3. Final rinse with distilled water; 4. Air dry the equipment; and, 5. Place on plastic for next use. All decontamination liquids and solids will be collected and characterized for offsite disposal. 11 2.7 Quality Assurance / Quality Control Refer to the QAPP provided as Appendix D for detailed QA/QC protocols. A New York State Department of Health Environmen tal Laboratory Approval Program (ELAP) Certified Laboratory will be used for all laborat ory analysis. The lab will be instructed to provide the data in a NYSDEC ASP Category B Deliverable. Th e laboratory data report will undergo independent third party data valid ation, which will include preparation of a Data Usability Summary Report (DUSR). The quality control samples will include trip blanks, field blanks, duplicat es, and matrix spike / matr ix spike duplicates. The frequency of the QA/QC samples is detailed in the QAPP. The method reporting limits (MRLs) will be those include d in NYSDEC ASP. All data will be submitted in an Electronic Data Deliverable (EDD) format compatible with EqUIS. 2.8 Health and Safety A Site Specific Health and Safety Plan (HAS P) is provided as Appendix E. All field personnel, including subcontractors and visitors to the site will be requ ired to adhere to the HASP. The intent of the HASP will be to protect individuals working on the project, as well as the general public in the vicinity of the project area. Procedures for air monitoring to protect project workers and the surrounding community during ground intrusive activities during the investigati on are included in the HASP. 2.9 Qualitative Human Heal th Exposure Assessment A qualitative human health exposure assessment will be performed to determine the potential for future exposure to site cont aminants in consider ation of the proposed development. The exposure assessment w ill be performed in accordance with NYSDEC DER-10 - Technical Guidance for Site Investigation and Remediation, May 2010, Appendix 3B. 12 3.0 REPORTING AND SCHEDULE A Site Characterization Findings Report will be prepared for submission to NYSDEC in accordance with the latest ed ition of NYSDEC DER-10 - T echnical Guidance for Site Investigation and Remediation. All data will be submitted in an Electronic Data Deliverable (EDD) format compatible with EqUIS. The findings re port will include a description of the work perf ormed, graphical and tabular presentations of the findings, and conclusions regarding appropriate mitigation requirements for construction and operation of the MTA Paratransit Facility. Conc lusions will also be drawn to the extent possible regarding the likelihood of any onsite or offsite sour ces of groundwater or soil vapor contamination. The field investigation is expected to requi re approximately two to three weeks. The validated Category B laboratory results with DUS Rs will be available within six weeks of sample collection. The Draft Site Characterization Findings Report will be submitted within approximately four weeks of r eceipt of the laboratory data.

C-11.0 INTRODUCTION This Sampling and Analysis Project Plan (SAPP) is prepared as part of the Site Characterization Work Plan to investigate the property pr oposed for the new Metr opolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) Paratransit Facility, located on Commerce Avenue, Bronx, New York (Figure 1 - Project Site Location). The SAPP outlines the specific sample collection and analysis procedures that will achieve the objectives of the investigation. The quality assurance/quality control methods to be used to ensure reliable a ccurate data are detailed in the Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) provide as Appendix D. All field ac tivities will be conducted in accordance with the Health and Safety Plan provided as Appendix E. The objectives of this investiga tion are to further characterize onsite soil, groundwater, and soil vapor conditions; to investig ate soil vapor and groundwater c onditions offsite along Commerce Avenue; and, to determine surface aquifer flow patterns. The results of the investigation will be used to identify appropriate mitigation measures to protect future users of the new Paratransit Fac ility from exposure to ha zardous materials. The results will also be used to evaluate the likelihoo d that the project site could be a source of soil vapor or groundwater contamination. The data collected during the investigation will be utilized to provide information to satisfy the following Data Quality Objectives (DQOs): Further delineate soil, groundwater, and soil vapor conditions with in the boundaries of the project site; Identify conditions in offsite soil va por and offsite groundwater along Commerce Avenue; and, Determine groundwater flow patterns in the immediate vicinity of the site. The data will be evaluated as follows: Onsite data will be used to determine if th e mitigation measures contained in the existing RAP are sufficient for c onstruction of the proposed Paratransit Facility; Offsite and onsite data will be evaluated in the context of groundwater flow patterns to determine the likelihood of any onsite or offsite contaminant sources. Once the field investigation activit ies have been performed, a dete rmination of the adequacy of the investigation will be made relative to the data quality objectives. Additional investigation may be required if all data quality objectives have not been met. EPM, Inc. C-22.0 SITE MANAGEMENT PLAN 2.1 Site Access, Security, and Permits The project site is currently vacant and owned by the City of New York. A locked security fence surrounds the entire site. No permits are considered necessary for work within the property line of the site. New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) Sidewalk Opening Permits will be obtained in order to install the monitoring wells and temporary soil vapor implants within the sidewalk along Commerce Avenue. Access to the onsite sampling locations will be through a secured gate. During sampling ac tivities, the Field Geologi st and/or the Site Safety Officer (SSO) will be responsible for recording the names, company represented, and the arrival and departure times of a ll persons who enter the site. Visitors to the site during field activities must comply with all aspects of the Health and Safety Plan provided as Appendix E. If the visitors have not received the proper OSHA 40- hour hazardous waste site training, they must be accompanied by trained personnel when they are in the work areas. 2.2 Traffic Control and Parking Only those vehicles directly involved with the field investigation activiti es (i.e., drill rig and support vehicles) will have access to work areas. All other vehicles will park in an area designated by the Field Geologist or SSO. It is expected that the borings within the public sidewalk can be performed without traffic in terruption to Commerce Avenue since a compact track mount drill rig will be used that will not encroach into the roadway. Safety cones and caution tape will be established around the work ar ea, and all work within the sidewalk will be conducted in accordance with the NYSDOT Permit stipulations. 2.3 Waste Disposal Drill cuttings and well development water generated during installation of the offsite wells, along with all decontamination liquids/solids, and co ntaminated personal protective equipment will be collected in USDOT-approved 55-gallon drums a nd temporarily stored onsite pending waste classification testing and transport to a permitted di sposal facility. Excess drill cuttings from the onsite borings will be returned to the borings they originated from unless gross signs of contamination are observed, in which case the cu ttings will be drummed fo r offsite disposal. Likewise, well development water from the onsite wells will be discharged to the unpaved land surface of the site unless contamination is obser ved, in which case the liquids will be drummed for offsite disposal. The specific waste trans port firm and disposal facility(s) ha ve not yet been determined. Only properly permitted transporters and disposal sites will be used. The fully executed waste EPM, Inc. C-3disposal manifests for any wastes disposed offsite will be incl uded in the Site Characterization Findings Report. 3.0 SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS METHODS 3.1 Soil Sampling and Analysis Soil samples from the ten Geoprobe borings w ill be continuously field screened from ground surface to the boring termination de pth. The cores will be collec ted in 5-foot long dedicated acetate liners. The soil will be field screened wi th a freshly calibrated photo-ionization detector (PID) for indications of organic vapors, and for visual or odor evidence of contamination. Three soil samples will be collected for laboratory anal ysis from each boring. A soil sample will be collected from each boring for lab analysis from the 0 to 2-foot depth, a second soil sample will be collected from each boring from the 2-foot inte rval at the boring terminus, and a third sample will be collected from a location with the greate st field evidence of contamination from between the top 2 feet of soil and the bottom of the boring. Soil samples will be prepared for the laboratory by placing the selected interval into a stainless steel mixing bowl, separating it into quarters, and placing an equal portion of each quarter into the proper laboratory provided co ntainers. To minimize volatilizat ion, soil samples collected for VOC analysis will not be composited in this manne r, but rather will consist of discreet samples collected from locations with the greatest PID re adings or other evidence of VOC impacts. The initial 24 inches of soil will be field screened for indications of VOCs at each boring. A discreet sample will be collected for VOC analysis from each boring from the location with the greatest evidence of impact from the upper 24 inches of so il, or from the upper 6 inches if no evidence of impacts are observed. The soil samples will be analyzed for Target Compound List (TCL) Volatile Organic Compounds+10 TICs (VOCs by Method 8260); TCL Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds+20 TICs (TCL SVOCs by Method 8270); PCBs by Method 8082, Pesticides by Method 8081, and Target Analyte List (TAL) metals by methods 6010/7000. The samples will be collected, stored, shipped, and analyzed accordi ng to the procedures detailed in the attached SAPP and QAPP. The QAPP contains a summary of the types of samples, analytical methods, and quality assurance samples that will be collected and analyzed. 3.2 Groundwater Sampling and Analysis The wells will be measured for depth to water and free product with an electronic interface probe. After these measurements are recorded, the wells will be purged and sampled with a low flow method bladder pump utilizing USEPA low-flow sampling procedures. Field EPM, Inc. C-4measurements will be record ed during purging for pH, temp erature, specific conductance, turbidity, reduction-oxidation potential, and diss olved oxygen until these parameters stabilize indicating that the well contains a representative groundwater sample. The purge volumes and chemistry measurements will be recorded on Low Flow Purge and Sampling Logs, an example of which is included in Appendix C-A. One round of groundwater samples will be collected from the eight wells for laboratory analysis of VOCs+10, SVOCs+20, PCBs, Pesticides, an d TAL Metals (total unfiltered). 3.3 Soil Vapor Sampling and Analysis A Geoprobe will be used to advance 1.5-inch outer diameter rods with expendable vapor sampling points to a sampling depth of six feet be low grade. If groundwat er is encountered at deeper than expected depths, a field decision will be made regarding placing the vapor probe deeper if possible. Current soil data for the s ite does not indicate a significant onsite source of VOCs in soil; however, the Geoprobe soil sampling will be performed prior to the soil vapor sampling so that the soil vapor locations can be adjusted to suspected source locations if identified. A 12-inch long stainless steel vapor sampling implan t will be inserted thro ugh the rod such that it is positioned at the bottom of the borehole. Dedicated Teflon tubing will be attached to the disposable implant. The annular space around the screen implant will be backfilled with clean #1 sand to two feet above the im plant screen. A bentonite seal will be placed above the sand extending to ground surface. The sample tubing w ill then be connected to a T connector 3-way valve apparatus with one end of the T connector attached to a vacuum pump and the other end attached to a batch certified summa canister with calibrated flow controller. The tubing will be purged at least approximately two volumes with a Gillian vacuum pump set at a flow rate of 0.2 liters per minute. A tracer gas (helium) will be used to verify that ambient air does not dilute the soil gas sample being collected. The gas will be used to enrich the atmosphere where the sample tubing meets the ground surface to test the borehole seal and confirm that ambient air is not entering the sample. A 5-gallon bucket will be placed over th e borehole and the tracer gas pumped into the bucket. A tedlar bag will be connected to the Gillian pump and filled with the purge gas as the helium is added to the bucket. Both the purge gas from the sample tubing and the helium enriched air in the bucket will be measured for helium with a Gas Check 3000 meter. If the tracer gas screening indicates the rate of helium detected in the sample tubing is greater than 20 percent of the helium detected in the bucket, the seals around the sampling apparatus will be reset and purged again until the tracer gas is no longe r present at levels greater than 20 percent of the enriched air within the bucket. EPM, Inc. C-5After the purge and tracer gas verification proce dures, the valve leading to the pump will be shut, the pump shut off, and the soil vapor then dir ected to the summa canister for collection of the sample. The flow controller on the summa canister will be set to a flow rate of 0.2 liters per minute or lower, and the soil vapor sample collected for 2 hours. After the sample is collected, the borehole will be backfilled with clean sand, a be ntonite seal, and grouted to the land surface. The summa canisters will then be shipped to the laboratory for analysis of VOCs by EPA Method TO-15 and methane by EPA Method TO-3. The purge data for each sample location will be recorded on Soil Vapor Sampling Field Logs, an example if which is provided in Appendix C-A. 3.4 Qualitative Human Heal th Exposure Assessment A qualitative human health exposure assessment will be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the New York State Departme nt of Health and NYSDEC. The exposure assessment will identify the potential routes of human exposure to contaminants at the site or migrating from the site, and any potential exposure pathways that may exist. Potential exposure pathways will be evaluated by identifying 1) contaminant sources , 2) contaminant release and transport mechanisms, 3) points of exposure, 4) routes of exposure, and 5) receptor populations. Additional data requirements wi ll be identified where appropriate. 3.5 Site Survey Upon completion of the sampling program, the ve rtical and horizontal locations of the soil borings and monitoring wells will be surveyed by a New York State Licensed Surveyor. The surveyed Site Plan will be provi ded in the Findings Report. 4.0 DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURES Designated decontamination areas will be established by the field Geologist. All non-disposable sampling equipment (augers, stainless steel mi xing bowls, trowels, spoons, etc.) will be decontaminated prior to initial use, between samp le locations, and prior to leaving the site) as follows: 1. Use a bristle brush and nonphosphate dete rgent (such as Alconox) in potable water to scrub equipment. 2. Rinse with potable water. 3. Rinse with distilled water. 4. Air dry the equipment and place on clean plastic for next use. EPM, Inc. C-65.0 DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN Proper management and documentation of field activities is essential to ensure that all field work is conducted efficiently and in accordance with the Field Sampling Plan and QAPP. Presented below are procedures for field documentati on, sample handling, packaging and shipping, QA/QC, and implementing field ch anges and corrective actions. 5.1 Field Documentation Field log sheets for collecting data during purging and sampling of the wells and during soil vapor sampling are provided in Appendix C-A. Bound field notebooks will be used to document daily field activities. Entries will be made in as much detail as possible so conditions may be reconstructed with minimal reliance on memor y. Daily entries made in the log books may include the following: Description and Sketch of Sample Locations, Number(s) and volume(s) of sample(s) taken, Description of sampling methodology, Date and time of sample collection, Sample Identification, Split samples (with another party), Field observations, including th e results of field analysis, A record of subcontractors a nd visitors at the site, and, Signature or initials of personne l responsible for log entries. Incoming documents will be date-stamped and filed. If necessary, the documents will be distributed to the appropriate project personnel. In addition, all notes from project meetings and telephone conversations will be filed, along with other project documents. 5.2 Sample Identification All samples will be given a unique designation that will be reco rded in the field log book, on the label affixed to the sample container, and on th e Chain-of-Custody form. Blind field replicate samples will be given numbers that will not indi cate the location being replicated. The replicate location will be recorded in the field notes. Trip blank and field blank samples will be labeled as \"TB\" and \"FB\", respectively, followed by a number and the date of shipment to the laboratory. Each sample bottle will be labeled with the sample designation as well as the date and time of collection, type of laboratory analysis, and initia ls of person(s) collecting the sample. EPM, Inc. C-75.3 Sample Handling, Packaging, and Shipping All analytical samples will be placed in the appr opriate sample containers as specified in the current NYSDEC Analytical Services Protocol (ASP). Sample volume requirements, sample container requirements, holding times, and pres ervation requirements are specified in the attached QAPP. All samples requiring chemical anal ysis will be shipped from the site to arrive at the laboratory within 48 hours of collection. The laboratory wi ll be notified by the Project Manager in a timely manner of the impending arri val of the samples. The laboratory will be prepared to receive the sample and perform pr eliminary extractions or analyses within the analytical method recommended holding times. Prior to packaging any sample for shipment, the sample containers will be checked for proper identification and compared to the Sampling Log and to the Chain-of-Custody Form for accuracy. The samples will then be wrapped with a cushioning material and placed in a cooler. Sufficient amounts of bagged ice or ice packs will be placed in the cooler to maintain the samples at 4\u00ba Celsius during sh ipment to the laboratory. All necessary documentation required to accompa ny the samples during shipment, including the Chain-of-Custody Record, will be placed in a sealed plastic bag a nd taped to the underside of the cooler lid. When the cooler is r eady, it will be seal ed with tape, and cust ody seals will be placed in such a manner that any opening of the cooler prior to arrival at the laborato ry can be detected. 6.0 QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL To identify the precision, accuracy, representativ eness, comparability, and completeness of data collected, quality control checks and quality assura nce audits will be performed as described in the attached QAPP. Specific procedures that will be followed in the field include the collection or preparation of QA/QC samples a nd the performance of field audits. 6.1 QA/QC Samples Blank and duplicate samples will be prepared during the field investigation. The purpose of these samples is to: 1. Check sample bottle preparation; 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of the field decontamination procedures and; 3. Evaluate the \"reproducibility\" and accuracy of laboratory anal ytical procedures. Equipment/field blanks will be performed for the type of sampling apparatus used (i.e. drill rig rods, sample compositing bowls, etc.). The equi pment / field blank will be prepared by pouring EPM, Inc. C-8analyte free water through the particular sa mpling device that has been decontaminated according to the procedure specified in the equipment decontamination section. 6.2 Performance of Field Audits During field activities, the Project Manager will periodically accompany sampling personnel into the field to verify that the fi eld sampling plan is being implem ented properly. All findings will be documented and filed. 6.3 Field Changes and Corrective Actions Frequently, unanticipated conditions necessitate modification to th e proposed field activities. If it becomes necessary to modify the field prog ram, the EPM Project Manager will notify the NYSDEC of the necessary changes. All change s made in the field during the investigation program will be documented and signed by the EPM Site Geologist. The EPM Project Manager is responsible for controlling, tracking, and impl ementing program changes. Documentation of the changes will be included in the findings report that will be submitted to NYSDEC. EPM, Inc.

Refer to Figure 1 and Figure 2 in the Work Plan for the project site location and proposed sampling locations, respectively. This QAPP presents the projec t organization, data quality obj ectives, and data management procedures for implementing the investigation. The QAPP identifi es the specific quality control (QC) checks and quality assurance (QA) auditing pr ocesses to be undertaken for the project. 2.0 Project Description The site is bounded by Commerce Avenue to the west/nort hwest and Westchester Creek to the east/southeast, and is located in the Unionport neighborhood of the Bronx. The site is currently vacant and oc cupies an approximate 94,958 square-foot portion of Block 3838, Lot 60. The Department of Housing, Preservation and Development currently has jurisdiction over the site. The proposed Paratransit Facility w ill include parking for approximately 150 Paratransit vehicles and an approximate 5,000 square- foot building that will in clude a training room, administrative office areas, and other back of house areas. The remainder of the site will be completed as paved parking, with small landsca ped areas possible within the sidewalk area along Commerce Avenue. It is expected that the new facility will serve to receive new vehicles from manufacturers and retired vehicles from private operators for temporary storage onsite until disbursed to new operators/owners; perform asset recovery of selected vehicle equipment; and, train drivers and maintainers in the operation and maintenance of the vehicles. 2.1 Data Quality Objectives The objectives of this investiga tion are to further characterize onsite soil, groundwater, and soil vapor conditions; to investig ate soil vapor and groundwater c onditions offsite along Commerce Avenue; and, to determine surface aquifer flow patterns. The data collected during the investigation will be utilized to provide information to satisfy the following Data Quality Objectives (DQOs): D-2 Further delineate soil, groundwater, and soil vapor conditions with in the boundaries of the project site; Identify conditions in offsite soil va por and offsite groundwater along Commerce Avenue; Determine groundwater flow patterns in the immediate vicinity of the site; The data will be evaluated as follows: Onsite data will be used to determine if th e mitigation measures contained in the existing RAP are sufficient for c onstruction of the proposed Paratransit Facility; Offsite and onsite data will be evaluated in the context of groundwater flow patterns to determine the likelihood of any onsite or offsite contaminant sources. 3.0 Project Organization and Responsibilities 3.1 EPM Personnel The following EPM personnel have designa ted responsibilities on this project: Glenn Umstetter, P.E., Quality Assurance Manager. The Quality Assurance Manager is responsible for performance of quality control checks and quality assurance audits during fi eld operations and review of proj ect documents and reports. Richard Hart, Project Manager. The Project Manager is responsib le for overseeing the implementa tion of the investigation. All documents including the work plan, reports, appr ovals and other corresponde nce will be routed through and approved by the Project Manager. The Project Manager is responsible for the technical adequacy of the inves tigation and all associated activities, including conformance to the work plan. The Project Manager is responsib le for reporting the progress of the investigation to NYSDEC. Judah Lebow, Field Geologist / Site Safety Officer. Darren Frank, Field Geologist / Al ternate Site Safety Officer. The Field Geologist responsibili ties include overall project co ordination, meeting the project schedule, sample collection, supervision of subc ontractors in the field, reviewing and assessing data, and preparation of project reports. Th e Site Safety Officer is responsible for implementation of the health and safety require ments and emergency response as presented in the Health and Safety Plan (HASP). The EPM personnel identified above have been trained and certified in the Occupational Safety and Hea lth Administration Hazardous Waste Operations Procedures. D-33.2 Subcontractors EPM anticipates that the following types of subcontractors will be working on the investigation, although the specific firms have not yet been selected pending a bidding process: Geoprobe and Hollow Stem Auger Drill Rig Services; Analytical Laboratory Services; Independent Data Validation; NY State Licensed Surveyor; and, Waste Transport and Disposal Firms. 4.0 Quality Assurance Object ives for Data Measurement The QA objective is to develop and implement procedures for field measurements and sampling and analytical testing that will provide data of known quality that is consistent with the intended use of the information. This se ction identifies the objectives by describing the use of the data, specifying the applicable field checks, and defining the acceptable criteria for data quality. 4.1 Data Usage and Requirements The intended use of the data is as follows: Onsite data will be used to determine if th e mitigation measures contained in the existing RAP are sufficient for c onstruction of the proposed Paratransit Facility; Offsite and onsite data will be evaluated in the context of groundwater flow patterns to determine the likelihood of any onsite or offsite contaminant sources. 4.2 Level of Quality Control Effort The field sampling team will use different types of QA/QC sample s to ensure and document the integrity of the sampling procedures, laboratory handling procedures, and validate the measured data. A summary of the Quality Control samples is provided in Table Q-1. The targeted laboratory reporting limits (R Ls) will be in accordance with NYSDEC ASP protocols, and are provided in the attached Ta ble Q-2. The laboratory makes every effort to achieve the RLs unless high concentr ations of the target analyte, or an interfering compound are present, necessitating sample dilution, or often, resulting in an interference that requires an elevated limit. The laboratory fl ags such data with footnotes. D-4In order to achieve the project DQOs, specific da ta quality requirements such as Precision, Accuracy, Representativeness, Completeness, and Comparability (PARCC) are required. 4.2.1 Precision Sampling precision will be measured to dem onstrate reproducible analytical data by the collection of at least one duplicate for every 20 soil samples taken in the field. All field sample duplicates will be collected in the same manner (split portion from) as all other samples as follows: collected at the same time, utilizing the same sampling methods, sampling equipment, sample containers a nd preservatives. 4.2.2 Accuracy Accuracy is defined as a measurement of bias th at exists in a measurement system. Systems of bias that may be introduced either in the collect ion or analysis of the samples may be external contamination, incorrect handling, or equipment malfunction. 4.2.2a Analytical Accuracy Analytical accuracy will be measured in the labo ratory as the recovery of a known analyte that has been added to a sample prior to analysis. Accuracy is checked as part of the laboratory's QA/QC as the matrix spikes and surrogate spike. 4.2.2b Sampling Accuracy Sampling accuracy will be assessed by the use of field blanks. Blanks help in quantifying the possibility of the introduction of a contaminant by either problem s in the collection or handling of the samples. Under ideal conditions, the bl anks should show no cont amination. One field blank will be collected for every 20 samples per t ype of media sampled. While blanks can assess the introduction of external contam inants into a sample, they cannot define a loss of contaminant concentration, if any, from the samples. Any loss in concentration can only be limited by the strict adherence to established Standard Operatin g Procedures (SOPs) as per the New York State Department of Environmental Cons ervation (NYSDEC) protocols. 4.2.3 Representativeness Representativeness is the degree to which sampli ng data accurately and precisely represents selected characteristics. All sampling will be co nducted in accordance with NYSDEC protocols. D-54.2.4 Completeness The data quality objective for th e completeness of the data with respect to sampling is 100%. In the event that 100% data completeness is not ob tained, due to inaccessibility of sampling points or other field conditions, the effect of the uncollected data will be evaluated by the Quality Assurance Manager. Corrective actions will be implemented to resolve any data gaps found as a result of less than 100% data completeness. 4.2.5 Comparability The methods used for collectio n and analysis of samples as documented in the QAPP are expected to provide comparable data. EP M will use standardized methods per NYSDEC protocols of field analysis, sample collection, ho lding times, and preservation (refer to Table Q- 1). In addition, field conditions will be documented and considered when evaluating data to determine the effects of sample characteristics or analytical results. Whenever possible, the same sampling team will obtain all samples on c onsecutive days to reduce inconsistencies which may be caused by technique and time variables. 4.3 Quality Control Objective The QC objective is to provide data of known and acceptable quality. QC check samples will be analyzed and results evaluated. The QC check samples include: Field blank samples Surrogate spikes Matrix spikes Duplicate samples 5.0 Sampling Procedures Quality control procedures to be adopted in the field include the collection of a field blank for testing decontamination procedures on sampling e quipment. One field blank per 20 samples will be prepared and submitted for each type of sampling equipment utilized. The field blank will be prepared using laboratory supplied deionize d water to fill the appropriate sample containers. Standard sampling equipment and procedures will be us ed for the field blank preparation. The field blank will be treated as a separate sample for identification, logging and shipping. D-6The laboratory targets will meet the specific QA/QC conditions stipulated in the current \"Statement of Work of the Contract Lab Program.\" All QA/QC documentation following ASP Exhibit B procedures will be provid ed in the laboratory report. Quality Control for the laboratory equipment and procedures will be achieved by collecting blind duplicate samples and matrix spike/matrix spike duplicate samples. Blind Duplicate samples will be collected at a frequency of one per 20 samples of each media being sampled. The duplicate sample will be labeled \"Duplicate\" so that its identification is not known to the laboratory and its identification will be recorded in the field log. A Matrix Spike sample and a Matrix Spike Duplicate sample will be collected at a frequency of one per 20 samples of each media. The recovery data for the spiked samples will be included in the laboratory deliverables package. 6.0 Sample Custody Sampling team personnel will perform all sampling and will be responsible for proper chain of custody documentation. Th is documentation begins upon releas e of the empty sa mple containers from the laboratory to sampling personnel. This initial transfer is marked on a chain of custody form. Examples of the chain-of-custody forms to be used are provided as Appendix D-A. Sampling personnel will retain custo dy of the sample containers unt il shipment of the samples to the laboratory. When the c ontainers are filled, the sampling personnel shall record the appropriate information on the chain of custody doc ument. The samples will then be packed in ice and delivered to the laboratory. At the laboratory, an authorized representative from the lab will accept custody of the samples and annotate such on the ch ain of custody document. The laborat ory will be informed that they are responsible for completion of the correct information on a chain of custody document each time the responsibility for the sample changes fro m one individual to anot her. Upon completion of the sample analysis, the chain of custody docum entation will be attached to the data report. 7.0 Calibration Procedures The calibration procedures for the laboratory instruments used for sample analysis will be performed according to those sp ecific to the analytical method. D-78.0 Analytical Procedures All laboratory analysis will be performed in accordance with NYSDEC ASP methods and provided in an Appendix B Data Deliverable Package with a Data Usability Summary Report prepared by an independent party. The soil samples will be analyzed for Ta rget Compound List (TCL) Volatile Organic Compounds + 10 TICs (VOCs by Method 8260b); TCL Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds + 20 TICs (TCL SVOCs by Method 8270c); PCBs by Method 8082, Pesticides by Method 8081, and Target Analyte List (TAL) metals by met hods 6010/7000. The groundwater samples will be analyzed for TCL VOCs+10, TCL SVOCs+20, P CBs, Pesticides, and TAL Metals (total unfiltered). The soil vapor samples will be analyzed for VOCs by EPA Method TO-15. 9.0 Data Reduction, Validation, and Reporting The laboratory data package will be evaluated following its completion by an independent third party data validation consultant. Currently, Julie Smith is expected to perform this task, with Ms. Smith's qualifications provided as Appendix D- B. Should an alternative data validator be proposed, the person's qualifications will be provided to NYSDEC for approval. 10.0 Internal Quality Control Field personnel will utilize duplicate samples and field blanks. To reduce the possibility of cross-contamination of the samples, all equipment that comes in contact with the sample that are not single-use disposable items will be decontam inated between each use. The decontamination procedure includes a wash with Alconox detergent, potable water rinse, followed by a rinse with distilled water. 11.0 Performance and System Audits Performance and system audits will be performe d on a periodic basis to ensure that the site investigation field activities ar e implemented in accordance with the approved Work Plan and in accordance with good work practices. The Qualit y Assurance Manager will oversee field personnel and check that the data is being obtaine d in an appropriate and organized manner. The data packages submitted by the laboratory will be checked to see that sample holding times were met, analysis were performed as requested, a ppropriate QC samples were reported and conform to requirements, etc. D-812.0 Preventive Maintenance EPM personnel will check all field equipment to ma ke sure that it is in good working order prior to field sampling activities (cleane d, charged, calibrating correctly). 13.0 Data Assessment Procedures The field and laboratory data will be assessed for precision, accuracy, representativeness, comparability and completeness using the field and lab QC check samples. 14.0 Corrective Actions The QA/QC program enables problems with the data to be identified, controlled, and corrected. Any person identifying an unacceptable condition w ill bring such to the attention of the Project Director and documented in the field log as we ll as any corrective action taken. Deviations identified by the laboratory will be documented in the data package as well as any corrective action taken. Corrective actions may include re-s ampling, reanalysis of samples, or modifying the project procedures. 15.0 Quality Assurance Reports Data collection activities will be documented in field log books for review. The data packages prepared by the laboratory will include analytical data, results of QC samp les, and a summary of any deviations or problems encountered with the samples and corrective actions taken.

This HASP focuses on the hazards associated with working in contact with potentially contaminated soil and groundwater, as well as the physical hazards associated with drilling equipment. The drilling contractor will be required to sign-off on and adhere to this HASP. The HASP Acceptance Form is provided in Attachment I. The procedures described in this document were developed in accordance with the provision of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rule 29 CFR 1910.120, and EPM's experience with similar projects. All field personnel performing duties on the environmental investigation must read this HASP before entering the project site. EPM's Site Health and Safety Officer (SHSO) will ensure that personnel have reviewed the HASP. All site personnel will be briefed on the contents of the HASP at daily safety briefings to be held prior to the start of each day's work. New employees will be briefed at that start of their firs t day and will be required to sign the New Employee Orientation Form provided in Attachment I. All field personnel will also sign the acknowledgement form also provided in Attachment I. Daily tailgate safety meetings will be held at the start of each work day to review the contents of the HASP and general safety procedures for that day's scope of work. The recommended health and safety guidelines in this document may be modified, if warranted, by additional information obtained prior to or during field activities. 2.0 Planned Field Activities The detailed investigation procedures are described in the associated Site Characterization Work Plan, Sampling and Analysis Project Plan, and Quality Assurance Project Plan. The proposed soil, groundwater, and soil vapor sample locations are shown on Figure 2. A Geoprobe\u00ae soil coring machine will be used to advance soil borings and soil vapor implants. A hallow stem auger drill rig will be used to install permanent groundwater monitoring wells. Groundwater samples will be collected from the monitoring wells using low flow sampling procedures. Soil vapor samples will be collected in Summa Canisters. Soil samples will be collected from the Geoprobe borings.The soil and groundwater samples will be analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, and metals. The soil gas samples will be analyzed for VOCs.EPM, Inc. 23.0 POTENTIAL CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL HAZARDS 3.1 Potential Chemical Hazards This HASP focuses on the following chemicals of concern: x Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs); x Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds (SVOCs); x Heavy Metals; and, x Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). Attachment II lists the exposure limits, physical and chemical properties, recommended protection levels and symptoms of exposure to the chemical compounds of concern. The chemical hazards will be minimized by limiting exposure of personnel to hazardous conditions and by the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Dust suppression controls may also be used to limit exposure if warranted. 3.2 Physical Hazards Physical hazards present at the site include the following: x Slip, trip and fall hazards; x Environmental (heat/cold) stress (refer to Attachment III ); x Noise Hazards; x Use of heavy equipment; and, x Moving vehicle hazards. Site personnel will be briefed at each day's tailgate safety meeting on the hazards of and safety protocols for heat and cold stress that are contained in Attachment III . Public street closures and maintenance and protection of traffic plans are not considered necessary. Entrances to the project site location will be secured prohibiting pedestrians from entering the work zone. 3.3 Biological Hazards Based on the vegetated conditions of the project site, there is a potential for exposure to biological hazards such as snakes and insects, including ticks. Basic protective Level D clothing, including work boots and long pants and tick spray if warranted is considered sufficient for protection. The following NIOSH recommended procedures will be followed to prevent exposure to tick bites if warranted. Refer to Attachment II for additional information about avoiding tick bites, recognizing the symptoms of Lyme Disease, and appropriate medical responses. EPM, Inc. 3To avoid tick bites: x Wear a hat and light-colored clothing, including long-sleeved shirts and long pants tucked into boots or socks. x Use insect repellents containing 20%-30% DEET on your exposed skin and clothing to prevent tick bites. Reapply repellent as needed. x Periodically check skin and clothes for ticks, and at the end of each shift. The immature forms of these ticks are very small and may be hard to see. o Check hair, underarms, and groin for ticks. o Immediately remove ticks from your body using fine-tipped tweezers. o Grasp the tick firmly and as close to your skin as possible. o Pull the tick's body away from your skin with a steady motion. o Clean the area with soap and water. x Wash and dry work clothes in a hot dryer to kill any ticks present. x Learn the symptoms of tick-borne diseases (stated below). x If you develop symptoms of a tick-borne disease seek medical attention promptly. Be sure to inform health care provider that you work outdoors in an area where ticks may be present. Lyme disease may cause one or more of the following symptoms: x An expanding circular rash called erythema migrans (may look like a red bulls-eye at the site of the tick bite) x Fever x Joint and muscle pains x Headache x Chills x Fatigue x Swollen lymph nodes 4.0 HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOL 4.1 Project Team Organization 4.1.1 Health and Safety Team EPM personnel responsible for implementation of this Health and Safety Plan are: Personnel Responsibilities Bob Vasiliades, CIH Corporate Health and Safety Officer Richard Hart Project Health and Safety Officer/Project Manager Judah Lebow Site Health and Safety Officer (SHSO) Darren Frank Alternate SHSO Judah Lebow is the designated Competent Person / SHSO for EPM's field activity. When Mr. Lebow is not onsite during EPM's field work, the Project Health and Safety EPM, Inc. 4Officer or the Alternate SHSO will serve as the Competent Person / SHSO. OSHA 40- hour Training Certificates for personnel likely to be onsite are provided as Attachment IV. 4.1.2 The Site Health and Safety Officer The Site Health and Safety Officer (SHSO) and the Project Health and Safety Officer or there designees are responsible for the following: 1. Monitoring to determine the degree of hazard. 2. Establish site work zones. 3. Ensure that all personnel in the work zone are wearing proper hearing protection. 4. Determining the protection levels and equipment required to ensure the safety of personnel. 5. Evaluating on-site conditions (i.e., weather and chemical hazard information) and recommending to the project manager and/or the field coordinator, modifications to the work plan and personal protection level. 6. Monitoring performance of all personnel to ensure compliance with the required safety procedures. 7. Notifying emergency authorities (police, fire and ambulance) of the team's presence, assignments and emergency procedures (as required). 8. Ensuring that all personnel have been trained in proper site safety procedures and the use of PPE, and have read and signed the Acknowledgement Form (Attachment II). 9. Conducting daily briefings as necessary. 10. Halting work if necessary. 11. Ensuring strict adherence to the Site HASP. 12. Reviewing personnel medical monitoring participation and health and safety training. The minimum qualifications for each individual participating in field activities are: EPM, Inc. 5x OSHA specific medicals including, but not limited to, audiometric testing under the hearing conservation program. x Participation in an Occupational Health Monitoring Program. x Successful completion of the 40-hour OSHA health and safety training for hazardous material sites (29 CFR 1910.120(e)(3)(i)) and valid/up-to-date 8-hour refresher training of each site worker's training certifications will be available onsite. x 8-hour OSHA Supervisor Training (if the SHSO determines potentially hazardous conditions exist). x Additionally, it is recommended that key field personnel be trained in first aid and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Project personnel will be under the direct supervision of a trained and experienced supervisor for a minimum of one day. The anticipated site activities do not include the need for specific operations, such as lock-out/tag-out, scaffolds or confined spaces. Therefore, these items are not addressed in the HASP. If a change in work scope occurs that requires these operations, an addendum to the HASP will be prepared and properly trained and experienced personnel shall be utilized. 4.2 General Safety Rules The following general safety rules apply to the project. 1. Work boots, hard hats, and reflective orange vests must be worn at all times. 2. Remove slipping, tripping or falling hazards from paths or roadways. 3. During work executions, pause every few minutes and assess surrounding traffic conditions. The SHSO will serve as a \"spotter,\" to the maximum extent possible, keeping a lookout throughout field activities. 4. Hearing protection will be used during operation of loud machinery, including the Geoprobe soil coring machine. 5. Crossing highways and major roadways is not recommended. Expect movement of cars, trucks, and buses at any time, along any roadway regardless of traffic signals, stop signs, yield signs, etc. 6. When walking on right-of-ways or road-shoulders, keep a sharp lookout in both directions. 7. Be sure that the appropriate roadway safety equipment is on site including road flares, reflective traffic cones, flags, etc. EPM, Inc. 68. For personal safety, be cognizant of your surroundings and ensure that equipment is properly secured. 9. Do not remain bent over or sitting along busy roadways - remain visible at all times. 10. All personnel who participate in field activities will be required to attend a Health and Safety meeting prior to the commencement of field activities. 4.3 Personal Hygiene Eating, drinking and the use of tobacco products in the work area are prohibited. The use of alcohol or other non-prescription drugs that could impair the ability to function at the job-site by personnel is prohibited. The use of some prescription drugs may impair the ability to function and can create safety problems on the job. Site personnel taking prescription medication should alert the SHSO in case of an emergency. Beards or facial hair that could interfere with the use of a re spirator are not allowed. Dermal contact with soil and groundwater should be avoided. This includes avoiding walking through puddles, pools, mud, sitting or leaning on or against drums, equipment, or on the ground. Site personnel should wash their hands before eating, smoking, using the toilet, etc. Site personnel should wash their hands, face and shower (daily) as soon as possible after leaving the Site. 4.4 Levels of Personal Protection The level of personal protection shall be re-evaluated on an ongoing basis. The SHSO may decide to upgrade the level of personal protection based on results of the air quality assessment and periodic air monitoring of the breathing zone with a photo ionization detector (PID) or specific site conditions observed during Site work. Personnel are always given the option to upgrade PPE. Downgrading of PPE is permissible only under the expressed direction of the SHSO. The SHSO is responsible for ensuring that adequate PPE and safety equipment supplies are maintained at the Site. Levels B or C protective equipment are not yet applicable to this project and are therefore not described herein. Should field observations require an upgrade to Level C or higher, work activities will stop and the HASP re-written to address the proper PPE needs in full accordance with OHSA 1910.120. 4.4.1 Level D PPE Level D applies to work in areas where contact with significantly hazardous contaminated groundwater and soil is not expected. Initially, it is anticipated that Level D PPE will be used for this work, and upgraded as necessary. The protective equipment for Level D includes: x Work clothes or coverallsEPM, Inc. 7x Safety work boots x Safety glasses x Hard hat x Reflective vest x Disposable latex gloves x First aid kit x Eye wash station x Potable drinking water or equivalent 4.4.2 Modified Level D Modified Level D protection will be used for dermal protection during field activities where there is a potential contact with significantly contaminated soil or groundwater. Protective equipment for modified level D includes: x Tyvek\u00ae QC coveralls x Outer Chemical resistant nitrile or required gloves and inner disposable latex gloves x Safety work boots x Hard hat x Safety glasses x Reflective vest x First aid kit x Eye wash station or bottles x Potable drinking water or equivalent x Joints between gloves, boots and suit must be taped 4.4.3 Level C (in addition to Modified Level D) x Full face air purifying respirator equipped with organic vapor cartridges and dust pre-filters, and x Chemical-resistant (neoprene) outer boots. 5.0 AIR MONITORING EQUIPMENT AND ACTION LEVELS Air quality monitoring equipment will be used during soil boring and sampling activities to detect the presence of organic vapors. A PID will be calibrated daily following the manufacturer's procedures. Significant generation of airborne dust is not expected when advancing the borings. Water misting will be instituted as necessary to prohibit airborne particulates at the boreholes. Background ambient VOC levels will be established on a daily basis. If the air concentration of total VOCs in the breathing zone of the work area exceeds 5 parts per million (ppm) above background for a 15 minute average, work activities will be halted EPM, Inc. 8temporarily and monitoring continued. If the total VOC level readily decreases (per instantaneous reading) below 5 ppm over background, work activities can resume with continued monitoring. If the air concentration of total VOCs in the breathing zone of the work area persists at levels above 5 ppm over background but less than 25 ppm, work activities will be halted, the source of vapors identified, corrective actions taken to abate emissions, and monitoring continued. After these steps, work activities can resume provided that the total organic vapor levels remain below 5 ppm with institution of the abatement steps. Such abatement would include forced air ventilation. If VOC levels are sustained at 25 ppm or greater within the breathing zone of the work area, activities will be shutdown and the need to upgrade to Level C PPE evaluated. 6.0 DECONTAMINATION 6.1 Site/Work Area Organization The organization of the Site/Work area shall consist of the following basic elements: x Exclusion zone - where the activity will take place and where contamination is either known or suspected to be present, or, because of the nature of the activity (use of mechanical equipment), it may potentially harm personnel. Entry into the exclusion zone requires the use of the level of PPE determined necessary by the SHSO. The exclusion zone will be the immediate work area surrounding a particular boring and will be delineated by safety cones and reflective caution tape. x Decontamination zone, located between the exclusion zone and support zone, where site workers will remove and containerize their contaminated PPE. x Support zone, located outside the exclusion zone, where the potential of encountering site hazards are minimal; therefore, PPE is not required. 6.2 Personnel Decontamination Decontamination of personnel consists of physically removing potentially contaminated soil particles from boots and the removal of PPE. A wire brush will be used to remove soil from boots, and disposable PPE will be containerized for offsite disposal. Should field observations indicate the need for an upgrade of PPE to Level C (refer to section 4.4), work shall stop and the HASP re-written to incorporate the applicable personnel decontamination procedures per OHSA 1910.120. EPM, Inc. 97.0 EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND CONTINGENCY PLAN 7.1 Personal Injury Emergency communications are to be maintained during all on-site field activities. During the safety briefing conducted prior to each day's work, all personnel will be instructed on the emergency evacuation route and gathering location. The nearest hospital to the project site with emergency room service is Calvary Hospital, located at 1740 Eastchester Road, Bronx County, NY. The telephone number for the hospital is (718) 518-2000. The route to the hospital from the work area is provided as Figure 3. A first-aid kit will be available on-site at all times to administer basic first aid. Emergency medical response will be sought should the injury require additional attention. On-site verbal communications should not be a problem since all tasks will be performed in Level D protection. If personnel are upgraded to Level C protection, or verbal communications become difficult for any reason, a universal set of hand signals will then be used. They are as follows: x Hand gripping throat: Can't breathe. x Grip partner's wrist or place hands around waist: Leave work area immediately. x Hand on top of head: Need assistance. x Thumbs up: Okay. I'm all right. x Thumbs down: No. negative. Communications from the site will be through a cellular telephone which will be brought to the site. All job-related injuries and illnesses will be reported to the SSO. If medical attention is needed, the injured worker will be decontaminated, if possible, prior to leaving the site. The SSO will investigate the cause of the accident and corrective measures will be taken before the work can resume. If there is a fatality, or if three or more workers are hospitalized as a result of a single incident, the SSO will contact the office health and safety manager immediately for OSHA reporting purposes. 7.2 Fires and Spills Since the project site consists of undeveloped, grassed areas, the potential for onsite fires is considered low, with the possible exception of malfunctioning drilling equipment. A fire extinguisher will be provided onsite at all times by the drilling contractor. On-site personnel will be instructed in the proper use of the fire extinguisher. A fire extinguisher EPM, Inc. 10should be used only for small fires in the early stages of development. Where the fire cannot be controlled through extinguisher use, the area will be evacuated immediately and the local fire department called to fight the fire. The phone number of the local fire department is provided in Table 1. The most likely source of spills or leaks of potentially hazardous material would be from the Geoprobe machine and support vehicles. These vehicles could potentially release fuel or other automotive fluids onto the site. In the event of such an occurrence, emergency spill response materials will be available on-site to immediately contain such spills should they occur. The spill response materials will include a \"spill bucket,\" with oil absorbent pads, plastic bags, additional PPE, plastic sheeting, and bags of clean sand. 7.3 Incident / Accident Investigation Process The three primary tasks of the incident/accide nt investigation process are to gather useful information, analyze the facts surrounding the occurrence, and write the investigation report. The intent of the investigation process is not to assign personal blame for the occurrence, but to determine the root cause of the occurrence and how it can be prevented in the future. In the event of an incident or accident, the SHSO and Project Health and Safety Officer will follow the following basic steps: Step 1 - Secure the incident/accident scene; Step 2 - Collect facts about what happened / develop sequence of events; Step 3 - Determine cause(s); Step 4 - Recommend improvements; and, Step 5 - Write a report summarizing above findings and recommendations. Copies of the incident/accident investigation forms to be completed by the SHSO or Project Health and Safety Officer in the event of such an occurrence are included in Attachment I.

Toxicological Information General E perimental chronic inhalation to icology studies showed kidney disease kidney cancer and liver cancer in animals following e posure to wholly vaporized petrol. Additional studies limited to the volatile fraction of petrol have not resulted in kidney damage which is generally considered to be a precursor to kidney cancer. Many scientists do not believe that the male rat is an appropriate animal model or predictor of human kidney cancer.Epidemiology studies in human e posed to hydrocarbons have not indicated e cess risk of kidney or liver cancer. Petrol typically contains benzene in concentrations from about 0.t to 5 . E cessive e posure to benzene may cause headaches loss of appepite rapid pulse fatigue increased bleeding tendencies and liver and kidney damage. Prolonged and repeated e posure to benzene has been associated with injury to and/or cancer of the bloof\u00edforming organs including aplastic anemia and leukemia. In animal studies benzene has also been associated with effects on the developing fetus. While the benzene content of petrol is relatively low it is important to minimize e posure to the skin and respiratory system to well within the current e psoure standards. Engineering controls including full enclosure vapour recovery or local e huast ventilation are recommended where routine e posure may e ceed applicable standards. Routine or intermittent skin contact should be avoided. Neoprene or nitrile gloves are recommended for routine handling of petrol/gasoline. Whole gasoline e huast was reviewed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC . Evidence for causing cancer was considered inade uate in animals and inade uate in humans. IARC placed whole gasoline e huast in Category 2B considering it possibly carcinogenic to humans. 12.

OEL - Occupational Exposure Limit, PEL - Permissible Exposure Limit, TL V - Threshold Limit Value, REL - Recommended Exposure Limit. Trade Names and Synonyms: HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION Emergency Overview: A bluish-white to silvery-grey heavy, soft metal that does not burn in bulk. Finely-divided lead dust clouds are a moderate fire and explosion hazard, however. W hen heated strongly in air, highly toxic lead oxide fumes can be generated. Inhalation or ingestion of lead may produce both acute and chronic health effects. Possible cancer and reproductive hazard. SCBA and full protective clothing are required for fire emergency response personnel. Potential Health Effects: Inhalation or ingestion of lead dust or fumes may result in headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal spasms, fatigue, sleep disturbances, weight loss, anemia and leg, arm, and joint pain. Prolonged exposure may also cause central nervous system damage, hypertension, gastrointestinal disturbances, anemia, kidney dysfunction and possible reproductive effects. Pregnant women should be protected from excessive exposure in order to prevent lead crossing the placental barrier and causing infant neurological disorders. Lead and inorganic lead co mpounds are listed as an A3 Carcinogen (Confirmed Animal Carcinogen with Unknown Relevance to Humans) by the ACGIH. IARC has listed lead compounds as Group 2A Carcinogens (Probably Carcinogenic to Humans) while lead metal is listed as Group 2B (Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans) . The NTP has recently liste d lead and lead compounds as Reasonably Anticipated to be a Human Carcinogen . OSHA and the EU does not currently list lead as a human carcinogen. (See Toxicological Information, Section 11) January 4, 2010 Lead Metal Page 2 of 6 Potential Environmental Effects: Lead metal has relatively low bioavailability; however, compounds which it forms with other elements can be toxic to both aquatic and terrestrial organisms at low concentrations. These compounds can be particularly toxic in the aquatic environ ment. Lead bioaccumulates in plants and animals in both aquatic and terrestrial environments (see Ecological Information, Section 12). EU Risk Phrase(s): R61 - May cause harm to unborn child; R62 - Risk of impaired fertility; R20/22 - Harmful by inhalation and if swallowed; R33 - Danger of cumulative effects. SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEASURES Eye Contact: Do not allow victim to rub eye(s). Let the eye(s) water naturally for a few minutes. If particle/dust does not dislodge, flush with lukewarm, gently flowing water for 5 minutes or until particle/dust is removed, while holding eyelid(s) op en. If irritation persists, immediately obtain medical attention. DO NOT attempt to manually remove anything stuck to the eye. Skin Contact: Dust: Remove contaminated clothing, shoes and leather goods (e.g. watchbands, belts). Quickly and gently blot or brush away excess chemical. Wash gently and thoroughly with lukewarm gently flowing water and non-abrasive soap for 5 minutes. If irritation persists, repeat flushing. Obtain medical advice. Completely decontaminate clothing, shoes and leathe r goods before reuse or else discard. Molten Metal: Flush contact area to solidify and cool but do not attempt to remove encrusted material or clothing. Cover burns and seek medical attention immediately. Inhalation: Remove victim from exposure area to fresh air immediately. If breathing has stopped, trained personnel should begin artificial respiration. Medical oxygen may be administered by trained personnel, where breathing is difficult. If the h eart has stopped, immediately start cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), or automated external defibrillation (AED). Quickly transport victim to an emergency care facility. Ingestion: Never give anything by mouth if victim is rapidly losing consciousness, or is unconscious or convulsing. Have victim rinse mouth thoroughly with water. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. Have victim drink 2 - 8 oz. (60 - 240 ml) of water. If vomiting occurs naturally, have victim rinse mouth with water again. Obtain medical advice and bring a copy of this MSDS. SECTION 5. FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES Fire and Explosion Hazards: Massive metal is not flammable or combustible. Finely-divided lead dust or powder is a moderate fire hazard and moderate explosion hazard when dispersed in the air at high concentrations and exposed to heat, flame, or other ignition sources. Explosions may also occur upon contact with certain incompatible materials (see Stability an d Reactivity, Section 10). Extinguishing Media: Use any means of extinction appropriate for surrounding fire conditions such as water spray, carbon dioxide, dry chemical, or foam. Fire Fighting: If possible, move material from fire area and cool material exposed to flame. Highly toxic lead oxide fumes may evolve in fires. Fire fighters must be fully trained and we ar full protective clothing incl uding an approved, self-contain ed breathing apparatus which supplies a positive air pressure within a full face-piece mask. Flashpoint and Method: Not Applicable. Upper and Lower Flammable Limit: Not Applicable. Autoignition Temperature: Not Applicable. SECTION 6. ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES Procedures for Cleanup: Control source of spillage if possible to do so safe ly. Restrict access to the area until completion of clean-up. Clean up spilled material immedi ately, observing precautions in Section 8, Personal Protection. Molten metal should be allowed to solidify before cleanup. If solid metal, wear gloves, pick up and return to process. If dust, wear recommended personal protective equipment (see Section 8) and use methods which will minimize dust generation (e.g., vacuum solids). Return uncontaminated spilled material to the process if possible. Place contaminated material in suitable labelled containers for later recovery or disposal. Treat or dispose of waste material in accordance with all local, regional, and national requirements. Personal Precautions: Persons responding to an accident al release should wear protective clothing, gloves and a respirator (see also Section 8). Close-fitting safety goggles may be necessary in some circumstances to prevent eye contact with dust and fume. Where molten metal is involved, wear heat-resistant gloves and suitable clothing for protection from hot-metal January 4, 2010 Lead Metal Page 3 of 6 splash as well as a respirator to protect against inhalation of lead fume. Workers should wash and change clothing following cleanup of a lead spill to prevent pe rsonal contamination with lead dust. Environmental Precautions: Lead metal has low bioavailability; however, compounds which it forms with other elements can be toxic to aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Releases of the product to water and soil should be prevented. SECTION 7. HANDLING AND STORAGE Store in a DRY, covered area, separate from strong acids, other incompatible materials, active metals and food or feedstuffs. Solid metal suspected of containing moisture should be THOROUGHLY DRIED before being added to a molten bath. Otherwise, entrained moisture could expand explosively and spatter molten metal out of the bath. Always practice good personal hygiene. Refrain from eating, drinking, or smoking in work areas. Thoroughly wash hands before eating, drinking, or smoking in appropriate, designated areas as well as at the end of the workday. No special packaging materials are required. EU Safety Phrase(s): S53 - Avoid exposure - obtain special instructions before use; S45 - In case of accident, or if you feel unwell, seek medical advice immediately (show label where possible) SECTION 8. EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION Protective Clothing: Gloves and coveralls or other work clothing are recommended to prevent prolonged or repeated direct skin contact when lead is processed. Appropriate eye protection should be worn where fume or dust is generated. Where hot or molten metal is handled, heat resistant gloves, goggles or face shield, and clothing to protect from hot metal splash should be worn. Safety type boots are recommended. Do not eat, drink or smoke in work areas. Thoroughly wash hands before eating, drinking, or smoking in appropriate, designated areas as well as at the end of the workday. A double locker-shower system with separate clean and dirty sides is usually required for lead handling operations to avoid cross-contamin ation of street clothes. Contaminated clothing should be changed frequently and la undered before each reuse. Inform laundry per sonnel of contaminants' hazards. Workers should not take dirty work clothes home and launder them with other personal clothing. Ventilation: Use adequate local or general ventil ation to maintain the concentration of lead fumes in the working environment well below recommended occupational exposure limits. Supply sufficient replacement air to make up for air removed by the exhaust system. Local exhaust is recommended for melting, casting, welding, grinding, flame cutting or burning, and use of lead powders. Respirators: Where lead dust or fumes are generated and cannot be cont rolled to within acceptable levels by engineering means, use appropriate NIOSH-approved respiratory protection equipment (a 42CFR84 Class N, R or P-100 particulate filter cartridge). When exposure levels are obviously high but the actual concentration is unknown, a self-contained breathing apparatus which supplies a positive air pressure within a full face-piece mask should be worn. SECTION 9. PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES Appearance: Malleable, bluish-white to silvery-grey Applicable Vapour Hg at @ Odour Threshold: None Solubility: Insoluble in water SECTION 10. STABILITY AND REACTIVITY Stability & Reactivity: Massive metal is stable and not considered reactive under normal temperatures and pressures. Hazardous polymerization or runaway reactions will not occur. Freshly cut or cast lead surfaces tarnish rapidly due to the formation of an insoluble protective layer of basic lead carbonate. January 4, 2010 Lead Metal Page 4 of 6 Incompatibilities: Lead reacts vigorously with strong acids (e.g. hot concentrated nitric acid, boiling concentrated hydrochloric acid, etc.), strong oxidizers such as peroxides, chlorates, nitrates and halogen or interhalogen compounds such as chlorine trifluoride. Powdered lead metal in contact with disodium acetylide, chlorine trifluoride, sodium carbide or fused ammonium nitrate poses a risk of explosion. Solutions of sodium azide in contact with lead metal can form lead azide, which is a detonating compound. Vigorous reactions can also occur between molten lead and active metals, such as sodium, potassium, lithium and calcium. A lead-zirconium alloy (1 0-70% Zr) will ignite when struck with a hammer. Hazardous Decomposition Products: High temperature operations such as oxy-acetylene cutting or burning, electric arc welding or overheating a molten bath will generate highly toxic lead oxide fume. Lead oxide is highly soluble in body fluids a nd the particle size of the metal fumes is largely within the resp irable size range, which increases the likelihood of inhalation and deposition of the fume within the body. SECTION 11. TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION General: Lead accumulates in bone and body organs once it enters the body. Eliminatio n from the body is slow. Initial and periodic medical examinations are advised for persons repeatedly exposed to levels above the exposure limits of lead dust or fumes. Once lead enters the body, it can affect a variety of organ systems, including the nervous system, kidneys, reproductive system, blood formation, and gastrointestinal system. The primary routes of exposure to lead are inhalation or ingestion of dust and fumes. Acute: Skin/Eye: Contact with dust or fume may cause local irritation but would not cause tissue damage. Inhalation: Exposure to lead dust or fume may cause headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal spasms, fatigue, sleep disturbances, weight loss, anemia, and pain in legs, arms, and joints. An intense, short-term exposure to lead could cause acute encephalopathy with seizures, coma, and death. However, short-term exposures of this magnitude are unlikely in industry today. Kidney damage, as well as anemia, can occur from acute exposure. Ingestion: Symptoms due to ingestion of lead dust or fume would be similar to those from inhalation. Other health effects such as metallic taste in the mouth and c onstipation or bloody di arrhea might also occur. Chronic: Prolonged exposure to lead dust and fume may produce many of the symptoms of short-term exposure and may also cause central nervous system damage, gastrointestinal disturbances, anemia, and, rarely, wrist drop. Reduced hemoglobin production has been associated with low lead exposures. Sympto ms of central nervous system damage due to moderate lead exposure include fatigue, headaches, tremors and hypertension. Very high lead exposure can result in lead encephalopathy with symptoms of hallucinations, convulsions, and delirium. Kidne y dysfunction and possible inju ry has also been associated with chronic lead poisoning. Chronic ov er-exposure to lead has been implicated as a causative agent for the impairment of male and female reproductive capacity. Pregnant women should be protected from excessive exposure as lead can cross the placental barrier and unborn children may suffer neurological damage or developmental problems due to excessive lead exposure. Teratogenic and mutagenic effects from exposure to lead have been reported in some studies but not in others. The literature is inconsistent and no firm conclusions can be drawn at this time. Lead and lead compounds are listed as an A3 Carcinogen (Confirmed Animal Carcinogen with Unknown Relevance to Humans) by the ACGIH. IARC has listed lead compounds as Group 2A Carcinogens (Probably Carcinogenic to Humans) while lead metal is listed as Group 2B (Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans) . The NTP has recently listed lead and lead compounds as Reasonably Anticipated to be a Human Carcinogen . OSHA and the EU do not currently list lead as a human carcinogen. SECTION 12. ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION While lead metal is relatively insoluble, its processing or ex tended exposure in aquatic and terrestrial environments may lead to the release of lead compounds in more bioavailable forms. While lead compounds are not particularly mobile in the aquatic environment, they can be toxic to aquatic organisms, especially fish, at low concentrations. Water hardness, pH and dissolved organic carbon content are three major factors which regulate the degree of lead toxicity. Lead in soil is generally neither v ery mobile nor bioavailable, as it can become strongly sorbed onto soil particles, increasingly so over time, to a degree related t o physical properties of the soil. Lead bioaccumulates in plants and animals in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. SECTION 13. DISPOSAL CONSIDERATIONS If material cannot be returned to process or salvage, dispose of in accordance with applicable regulations. SECTION 14.

The four main types of heat stress related illnesses: heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke are discussed. 1.1 Heat Rash Heat rash, also known as prickly heat, is likely to occur in hot, humid environments where sweat is not readily removed from the surface of the skin by evaporation and the skin remains wet most of the time. The sweat ducts become plugged, and a skin rash soon appears. When the rash is extensive or when it is complicated by an infection, prickly heat can be very uncomfortable and may reduce a worker's performance. The worker can prevent this condition by resting in a cool place part of each day and by regularly bathing and drying the skin. 1.2 Heat Cramps Heat cramps are painful spasms of the muscles that occur among those who sweat profusely in heat, drink large quantities of water, but do not adequately replace the body's salt loss. Drinking large quantities of water tends to dilute the body's fluids, while the body continues to lose salt. Shortly thereafter, the low salt level in the muscles causes painful cramps. The affected muscles may be part of the arms, legs or abdomen, but tired muscles (those used to perform the work) are usually the ones most susceptible to cramps. Cramps may occur during or after work hours and may be relieved by taking salted liquids by mouth, such as the variety of sports drinks on the market. CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERSIZED BY PEOPLE WITH HEART PROBLEMS OR THOSE ON LOW SODIUM DIETS WHO WORK IN HOT ENVIRONMENTS. THESE PEOPLE SHOULD CONSULT A PHYSICIAN ABOUT WHAT TO DO UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. 1.3 Heat Exhaustion Heat exhaustion includes several clinical disorders having symptoms that may resemble the early symptoms of heat stroke. Heat exhaustion is caused by the loss of large amounts of fluid by sweating, sometimes with excessive loss of salt. A worker suffering from this condition still sweats but experiences extreme weakness or fatigue, giddiness, nausea, or headache. In more serious cases, the victim may vomit or lose consciousness. The skin is clammy and moist, the complexion is pale or flushed, and the body temperature is normal or only slightly elevated. A summary of the key symptoms of heat exhaustion are as follows: /g120Weak Pulse In most cases, treatment involves having the victim rest in a cool place and drink plenty of fluids. Victims with mild cases of heat exhaustion usually recover spontaneously with this treatment. Those with severe cases may require extended care for several days. There are no known permanent effects. AS WITH HEAT CRAMPS, CERTAIN PERSONS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR PHYSICIAN ABOUT WHAT TO DO UNDER THESE CONDITIONS. 1.4 Heat Stroke This is the most serious of health problems associated with working in hot environments. It occurs when the body's temperature regulatory system fails and sweating becomes inadequate. The body's only effective means of removing excess heat is compromised with little warning to the victim that a crisis stage has been reached. A heat stroke victim's skin is hot, usually dry, red or spotted. Body temperature is usually 105\u00b0F or higher, and the victim is mentally confused, delirious, perhaps in convulsions, or unconscious. Unless the victim receives quick and appropriate treatment, death can occur. A summary of key symptoms of heat stroke are as follows: /g120Confusion /g120Convulsions /g120Incoherent Speech /g120Staggering Gait /g120Unconsciousness /g120Sweating stops /g120Hot skin, high temperature (yet extremities may feel chilled) Any person with signs or symptoms of heat stroke requires immediate hospitalization. However, first aid should be immediately administered. This includes moving the victim to a cool area, thoroughly soaking the clothing with water, and vigorously fanning the body to increase cooling. Further treatment at a medical facility should include continuation of the cooling process and the monitoring of complications that often accompany the heat stroke. Early recognition and treatment of heat stroke are the only means of preventing permanent brain damage or death. 1.5 Preparing for the Heat Humans, to a large extent, are capable of adjusting to heat. This acclimation to heat, under normal circumstances, usually takes about 5-7 days, during which time the body will undergo a series of changes that will make continued exposure to heat more tolerable. On the first day of exposure, body temperature, pulse rate, and general discomfort will be higher. With each succeeding day of exposure, all of these responses will gradually decrease, while the sweat rate will increase. When the body does become acclimated to the heat, the worker will find it possible to perform work with less strain and distress. A gradual exposure to heat gives the body time to become accustomed to higher temperatures, such as those encountered in chemical protective clothing. 1.6 Protecting against Heat Stress There are several methods that can be used to reduce heat stress: /g120Limit duration of work periods /g120Use protective clothing with cooling devices /g120Enforce the use of the \"Buddy System\" /g120Consume electrolyte solutions prior to suiting up /g120Monitor workers for pulse recovery rates, body fluid loss, body weight loss, and excess fatigue /g120Screen for heat stress susceptible candidates in your medical surveillance program /g120Have all personnel know the signs and symptoms of heat stress 2.0 COLD STRESS Persons working outdoors in temperatures at or below freezing may be frostbitten. Extreme cold for a short time may cause severe injury to the surface of the body, or result in profound generalized cooling, causing death. Areas of the body that have high surface area-to-volume ratio such as fingers, toes, and ears, are the most susceptible. Two factors influence the development of a cold injury; ambient temperature and the velocity of the wind. Wind chill is used to describe the chilling effect of moving air in combination with low temperature. For instance, 10 degrees Fahrenheit with a wind of 15 miles per hour (mph) is equivalent in chilling effect to still air at minus 18 degrees Fahrenheit. As a general rule, the greatest incremental increase in wind chill occurs when a wind of 5 mph increases to 10 mph. Additionally, water conducts heat 240 times faster than air. Thus, the body cools suddenly when chemical-protective equipment is removed if the clothing underneath is perspiration soaked. 2.1 Frostbite Local injury resulting from cold is included in the generic term frostbite. There are several degrees of damage. Frostbite of the extremities can be categorized into: /g120Frost Nip or Initial Frostbite: characterized by suddenly blanching or whitening of skin. /g120Superficial Frostbite: skin has a waxy or white appearance and is firm to the touch, but tissue beneath is resilient. /g120Deep Frostbite: tissues are cold, pale, and solid; extremely serious injury. 2.2 Hypothermia Systemic hypothermia is caused by exposure to freezing or rapidly dropping temperature. Its symptoms are usually exhibited in five stages: /g120Shivering /g120Apathy, listlessness, sleepiness, and (sometimes rapid cooling of the body to less than 95 degree Fahrenheit) /g120Unconsciousness, glassy stage, slow pulse, and slow respiratory rate /g120Freezing of the extremities /g120Death Thermal socks, long cotton or thermal underwear, hard hat liners and other cold weather gear can aid in the prevention of hypothermia. Blankets and warm drinks (other than caffeinated coffee) are also recommended. Measures shall be taken to keep workers from getting wet, such as issuance of rain gear. Workers whose clothes become wet shall be given the opportunity to dry off and change clothes.ATTACHMENT IV OSHA Certificates "}
