These forces can appear to be at cross purposes \u2014 with \"tradition\" stuck insis - tently in the past and \"innovation\" dismissing time's hard-earned wisdom. Fortunately, at a Jesuit university, we are blessed with a tradition of transformation. Saint Louis University's deep roots in the Jesuit tradition fuel our commitment to ask new questions, to envision new possibilities and to advance new solutions to the world's most urgent challenges. This issue of Universitas highlights just a few of the extraordinary things that become possi - ble when tradition and innovation meet: The foundational Jesuit principle of cura personalis \u2014 care for the whole person \u2014 is motivating a transformation of SLU's campus culture to support student well- being (page 12). Because of SLU's tradition of academic excellence, an impressive number of alumni have been at the forefront of scientific and technological advancements, playing pivotal roles in decades of space exploration (page 22). Experiential education \u2014 for centuries, a key element of Ignatian teaching and learning \u2014 is creating a new generation of leaders in the financial professions (page 28). SLU's community of Jesuits, foundational to our history, continues to shape our present and future. These dedicated men are integral to advancing the University's mission as teachers, scholars, ministers and leaders \u2014 and they now have a new home that reflects their central role in campus life (page 32). And generations of SLU alumni and supporters recently contributed to the historic conclusion of our Accelerating Excellence campaign \u2014 raising $604 million that will fuel a future of new possibilities for Saint Louis University (page 19). SLU is encountering a world of change. We responded effectively to the upheaval of a global pandemic by relying on the guidance of our experts and a firm commitment to our Jesuit values. We are navigating a challeng - ing environment for higher education, growing our enrollment and raising our research profile despite considerable headwinds. Our exceptional fac - ulty, staff and students do not shy away from challenge or from change. As stewards of this Jesuit institution, they adapt, they advance new initiatives, and they innovate to serve the greater good.

As alumni and friends of Saint Louis University, you are an essential part of our past, present and future. You exemplify the potential of Billikens around the world to transform your communities in the spirit of the Gospels. Each day, in your families, professions, faith commu - nities and civic lives, you show the potential of Jesuit values to shape the world as it ought to be.

The women's team, which achieved a unanimous top-10 national ranking this season, is a five- time defending A-10 champion and returned to the NCAA Women's Soccer Championship for the fifth straight season. The women posted a 10-0 record in winning the A-10 regular-season crown and carried a school-record 18-game winning streak \u2014 also the longest active streak in NCAA Division I women's soccer \u2014 into the national tournament. SLU was awarded a No. 2 seed for the 2022 NCAA Women's Soccer Championship but lost to former Conference USA rival Memphis in a first-round game. The men's team captured the Atlantic 10 Conference Championship in dramatic fashion, advancing past Loyola Chicago in penalty kicks. It was the second straight season that SLU was the A-10 regular-season and tournament champs. The Billikens went on to their 50th appearance in the NCAA Men's Soccer Championship, the most of all time. The team defeated Memphis in the first round and fell to Indiana in the second round.

Ownership of SLUCare Physician Group transitioned to SSM Health when the transaction closed last summer. For decades, SLUCare Physician Group and SLU School of Medicine partnered with SSM Health at SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital and, more recently, at SSM Health Saint Louis University Hospital. Integrating SLUCare Physician Group into SSM Health gives the community improved, seamless access to all levels of care. SLU Celebrates Launch of Taylor Geospatial Institute Saint Louis University President Dr. Fred P. Pestello announced the launch of the Taylor Geospatial Institute in April 2022 during an event at SLU's Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Building. Led by Saint Louis University, the Taylor Geospatial Institute (TGI) is a first-of-its-kind institution that brings together eight leading institutions to collaborate on research into geospatial technology. The other collaborating institutions are: The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, Harris-Stowe State University, Missouri University of Science and Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Missouri-Columbia, University of Missouri-St. Louis and Washington University in St. Louis. The TGI is funded by a legacy investment by Andrew C. Taylor, executive chairman of Enterprise Holdings Inc. and founding chair of Greater St. Louis Inc., with supporting investments from each of the eight member institu - tions. The institute builds on St. Louis' significant geospatial assets and positions the region as the global center of geospatial innovation, impact and excellence. Taylor said the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's construction of a new campus in North St. Louis combined with a visit to their current St. Louis office led him to believe geospatial would play a big role in the city going forward. He wanted to get involved and knew a regional collaboration made the most sense. The institute will be a hub for access to and development of technology powered by big data analytics and computing resources to support research and training. Pestello speaks with Taylor after the launch of the Taylor Geospatial Institute. INSTITUTE SECURES $1 MILLION GRANT In October, the TGI received a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation to create the Taylor Geospatial Institute Regional AI Learning System. The three-year grant was awarded to Dr. Vasit Sagan, associate professor of geospatial science at SLU and acting director of the TGI, along with Dr. William T.C. Kramer and Dr. Shaowen Wang, both from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The high-performance computing and data analysis system, known as TGI RAILS, will be housed at the National Petascale Computing Facility at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. \"The integration of SLUCare into SSM Health-St. Louis creates one of the most comprehensive, fully integrated academic and community-based physician groups in the region, with more than 1,200 providers,\" SLU President Dr. Fred P. Pestello said. \"This partnership bolsters our collective goal to improve the quality of life across generations and cultures while addressing the social determinants of health that prevent our neighbors from living life to the fullest. It will further serve to strengthen the academic and research missions of the School of Medicine.\" SSM Health and SLUCare Physician Group committed to a seamless transition, so patients experienced no disruption in health care providers or location of services. \"Both SSM Health and Saint Louis University School of Medicine have a rich legacy of providing hope and healing to those in need across the St. Louis community,\" Laura S. Kaiser (Grad CSB '85, Grad PH '85), president and CEO of SSM Health, said. \"SSM Health's founding congregation, the Franciscan Sisters of Mary, first arrived in St. Louis 150 years ago. As stew - ards of the healing ministry they began in 1872, we are thrilled to be taking this next step in our shared mission to ensure every patient gets the best care possible while keeping that care affordable for the individuals and families we serve.\" The agreement also represents a significant investment in the School of Medicine. \"Saint Louis University School of Medicine has a long tradi - tion of excellence in academic leadership, educating the doctors and scientists of the future, while advancing cutting-edge clin - ical research and patient care,\" Dr. Christine Jacobs, dean of the School of Medicine and vice president of medical affairs, said. \"This partnership will expand the scope of our primary and spe - cialty health care, allowing greater access to clinical trials for our patients, while we educate diverse and committed future physicians for our region, and grow our research in the School of Medicine.\" SSM Health Saint Louis University Hospital and parking garage, viewed from Grand Boulevard PHOTO BY SARAH CONROY PHOTOS BY STEVE DOLAN Longtime VPs Kauffman, Fowler Retire June marked the official retirements of two long-serving Saint Louis University vice presidents, Bill Kauffman and Jeff Fowler. Kauffman, who was interim president of SLU for the 2013-14 academic year, served as SLU's vice president, general counsel and secretary of the University for more than 26 years. In the year before his retirement, he continued to serve as senior legal counsel and secretary of the University. \"We have all benefited from Bill's selfless ded - ication and wise leadership,\" said SLU President Dr. Fred P. Pestello. \"As an attorney, Bill has served SLU with distinction. As a colleague, his generosity and mentorship will leave a lasting impact on the University and those with whom he has worked.\" In honor of his retirement, contributions can be made to the William R. Kauffman Student Higher Education Law Legal Writing Competition. Fowler, who most recently served as vice pres - ident for marketing and communications, was at SLU for more than two decades. Following a career in broadcast journalism, he joined SLU in 2000 as director of media rela - tions. Fowler was promoted to associate vice president for marketing and communications in 2003. After six years, he was tapped to serve as vice president for advancement. In 2014 he became vice president of the new Marketing and Communications Division. \"I have valued our collaboration, and I have deep respect for Jeff's integrity, loyalty and love for Saint Louis University,\" Pestello said. \"We are a better University for his contributions.\" Gifts in honor of Fowler's retirement are being directed to SLU's Student Mental Health Support Fund. Kauffman FowlerNew Institute Will Advance Neuroscience Research In November, Saint Louis University announced the launch of the Institute for Translational Neuroscience (ITN). The institute brings together experts in biochemistry, chemistry, pharmacology, social justice and community outreach to study the physiology and diseases of the brain and central nervous system, and thereby ease human suffering. Under the direction of Dr. Daniela Salvemini, SLU's William Beaumont professor and chair of the Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, and growing out of the Henry and Amelia Nasrallah Center for Neuroscience, ITN aims to improve human health through the work of pre-clinical and clinical researchers in areas that include cognition, Alzheimer's disease, chronic neuropathic pain, opioids, metabolism and traumatic brain injury. Comprising more than 100 members across six schools and colleges from 23 departments at SLU, the institute offers students the opportunity to develop skills in neuroscience fields, beginning at the undergraduate level.

The 2022 homecoming included the traditional fireworks, a Billiken men's soccer game, a carnival on campus and many other events.Homecoming and Family Weekend is three days of events celebrating SLU, held the last weekend in September. The 2023 event is scheduled for Sept. 22-24.

A heady time to learn and grow, to experience and experiment, to \"find yourself\" and forge your future. But over the last decade \u2014 to say nothing of the last few years, especially \u2014 college has been anything but the best four years for a lot of people. Campuses across the country have noticed an alarming increase in anxiety, depression and suicide among students \u2014 and that was before the COVID-19 pandemic. Between fall 2019 and spring 2020, the Healthy Minds Network and the American College Health Association found that depres - sion in college students rose from 36% to 41%, and the percentage who said mental health affected their academic performance increased by nearly 9%, to 31%. In June 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that a quarter of 18- to 24-year-olds seriously con - templated suicide. Texas A&M University later reported that 71% of college students experi - enced increased stress and anxiety due to the pandemic. Saint Louis University hasn't been immune to any of this. After a very difficult few years, the University has responded with sustained care and support, and renewed its commitment to a campus culture of well-being. \"The challenges our students have faced, and our community has faced here at SLU, are unfortunately not unique to the greater land - scape within higher education,\" said Dr. Sarah Cunningham, SLU's vice president for student development. \"But we have known that this work is a priority, and we're continuing to ele- vate and enhance our commitment to student well-being.\" A Culture of Cura Personalis The Jesuit concept of \"caring for the whole person\" informs and inspires Saint Louis University to prioritize the well-being of the whole community.

The national program promotes connectedness and awareness through a variety of interactive booths.14 UNIVERSITAS THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE OF SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY WINTER 2023 15 ACCEPTING THE MISSION The University's Jesuit tradition calls for care and development of the whole person. So, a well-rounded approach has always been charac - teristic of a SLU education. \"This concept of cura personalis \u2014 how the mind, body and spirit help to make up the whole person \u2014 that's central to our mission. We know that when one of those is out of balance, it impacts everything else,\" Eric Anderson (Grad CSB '04) said. Anderson has worked in campus recreation at SLU since 1999. \"We've been doing wellness for a long time,\" he said. \"But in the last three years or so, there's been a shift from using the term 'wellness' to 'well-being.' The goal for well-being is broader: not just the individual, but also the community.\" This means not just offering wellness resources \u2014 such as the Student Health Center and the 120,000-square-foot Simon Recreation Center \u2014 but also considering how the University can provide comprehensive support to all in the community. Staff from Student Development, the Dean of Students Office, the University Counseling Center, Housing and Residence Life, the Eckelkamp Center for Campus Ministry and other divisions have coordinated multiple points of response and care. \"The goal is for students to flourish. But what does that mean?\" Cunningham asked. \"If they graduate in four years but with significant anx - iety, huge debt and a question around their own confidence, that's not success. If our students are going to go set the world on fire, we need to position them to have the confidence and the resources and the ability to take care of them - selves to actually do that.\" A (TASK) FORCE FOR GOOD That broader perspective is the focus of Anderson's current position; he became the University's first assistant vice president for stu - dent well-being in August 2021. \"This new position showcases the University's dedication to supporting student well-being in a holistic and comprehensive way,\" Cunningham said. \"Eric's ability to be a nimble, collaborative and compassionate leader makes him the best person to help us shape the future of student well-being at SLU.\" HELP WANTED Even before the task force released its draft report, the University prioritized campus well-being. Many of these changes were prompted by the ongoing realities of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"As difficult as this past year has been, there's been such support across the institution. There are a lot of good things going on,\" Anderson said. The University Counseling Center (UCC) has seen increased service demand. During the 2020-21 school year, the number of appointments (including virtual ones) skyrocketed to more than 5,000. Although that number dropped over the last year, the UCC still provides more counseling appointments than in pre-pandemic years. To adjust to the student body's needs, the UCC looked at its systems and availability. They added several counselors. They began offering a 24-7 triage line (via an outside telehealth company) so that students can access care any - time they need it. The staff also started paying more attention to the particular needs of the students they serve, including graduate, medical and law students. In addition to making several strategic leadership hires over the past year, Anderson co-chaired the Student Well- being Task Force. The task force convened in the fall of 2021. Co-chaired by Dr. Ellen Barnidge (Grad PH '05, '08), interim dean and associate professor in the College for Public Health and Social Justice, the group comprised about 30 people across the University who spent the last academic year assessing SLU's well-being environment and developing recommendations to improve it. In addition to reviewing the resources SLU already had and considering data, trends and best practices, the task force conducted approximately 20 listening sessions with stakeholders across the University. \"We were able to engage the community in ways that were inclusive and also provided the opportunity to hear a lot of different perspectives,\" Anderson said. After all that input, the task force released a draft set of strategic priorities and proposed actions. \"We tried to make recommendations that were not only aspirational but inspirational,\" he said. \"Instead of creat - ing a specific to-do list, we challenged everyone to think about well-being as a core piece of their job in ways that they can prioritize and hopefully roll out. That will look different for different units and areas of expertise.\" The entire SLU community then had a chance to weigh in through an online survey. Anderson said that more than 80% of the responses were overwhelmingly positive. \"Part of the brilliance of what Eric and Ellen did was they created a space for our expertise from campus to really be highlighted,\" Cunningham said. \"We don't need to go out and buy modules and hire lots of people because we've got the talent here. Now, it's just figuring out how to leverage it.\" \"How do we make it more convenient for stu - dents to have services nearby, particularly if they spend a good portion of their time at one of our other campuses?\" Anderson said. \"We also wanted to think expansively around what well-being is for different domains,\" Knieba Jones-Johnson, director of the UCC, said. \"Whose voices are we not paying attention to? Who are the historically excluded groups of students that, because of race, religion, identity, have been ignored and are suffering because of it?\" On its website, the UCC has specific lists of mental health resources for students of color and LGBTQIA students. Jones-Johnson is working with SLU's Division of Diversity and Innovative Community Engagement to review how the counseling center responds to issues related to accessibility and disability. Students Jade Jameson (left) and Kayla Dalisay greet dogs during Cookies and Community last spring. The event is a stress reliever for the SLU community. (FROM LEFT) Heiden-Rootes, Jones-Johnson, Anderson, Cunningham and Harwood16 UNIVERSITAS THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE OF SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY WINTER 2023 17 \"You have to be able to slow down to develop the capacity for resilience,\" Jones-Johnson said. \"There's academic demand and rigor, but the result of that can be poor mental health and well-being. How do we resolve that?\" she asked. \"We allow and permit \u2014 and actually, not just allow and permit, but encourage and promote \u2014 rest, recuperation and rejuvenation.\" Dr. Katie Heiden-Rootes (Med '14), associate professor in the Medical Family Therapy Program, director of clinical services for the Center for Counseling and Family Therapy and assistant vice president for research in the Division of Diversity and Innovative Community Engagement, agreed. \"But those things are not a panacea,\" she said. \"It's like when you pull off a valve and let steam out, but then you put it back on. Wellness days are good for letting off steam, but they don't remove the pressure on our students.\" She suggested a change in the way faculty relate to students. \"We need to create an environment in which students feel supported and seen on an interpersonal level. That requires more work than wellness days,\" she said. \"I try to see my students who start to struggle not as an indicator of their inability to achieve, but that something is happening in their world that is making this difficult,\" Heiden-Rootes said. \"It's important to get to know students as people beyond their classroom performance.\" LOOKING OUT, REACHING OUT As professors get to know their students beyond the classroom, it's good to be aware of what diminished mental health looks like. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training helps. This one-day training teaches individuals how to identify, understand and respond to signs of mental illness and substance-use disorders. \"Think about American Red Cross CPR and first aid training,\" Anderson said. \"It's like that, but for mental health issues.\" Tori Harwood, whose department reports to Anderson, is SLU's MHFA coor - dinator. She was certified in the spring of 2021 to teach the course, as were three other SLU staff members. A grant from the National Council for Mental Well-Being provided for the certification of several more instructors this year. The goal is for all faculty, staff and students to be able to take the MHFA training. To date, more than 150 faculty and staff, and close to 200 students have been trained. The center started six student support groups in the spring, including around the unique needs of athletes, \"adulting,\" relationships, and stress reduction and anxiety management. In Wuller Hall, where counseling sessions are held, the UCC is creating a sensory/creative arts space and possibly spaces for expressive arts therapy and horticulture therapy. Jones-Johnson said, \"We're just looking at all different ways to heal, really.\" The UCC partnered with librarians from Pius XII Memorial Library to feature wellness books that students can check out. The shelf is located near the library's Wellness Space, a comfortable relax - ation area sponsored by the Student Government Association. Jones-Johnson would love to replicate similar spaces in the residence halls. For those students who might be struggling but don't need clinical help, the University has arranged for wellness coaching from a group called ComPsych. \"That would be for somebody who's a little overwhelmed and not quite sure the strategy on how to prepare for finals, or someone deal - ing with a disappointment \u2014 'I didn't get elected president of my student organization' \u2014 but who doesn't need ongoing counseling,\" Cunningham said. The UCC must be doing something right; SLU ranked No. 21 on Princeton Review's 2023 list of colleges and universities with the best student support and counseling services. LETTING OFF STEAM In the spring of 2021, the academic schedule was compressed due to COVID-19 but included \"men - tal health days\" throughout the semester instead of a weeklong spring break. SLU Provost Dr. Mike Lewis explained in a message to the University community: \"We need to give all students the necessary time and space to focus on their mental health during a compressed semester.\" The following fall, Lewis announced an impromptu mental health day to encourage undergraduates to take a break from classes and connect over University-sponsored activities such as yoga, an Examen walk, ice cream and more. The day was an extended version of pre- vious pre-exam activities that featured pop-up petting zoos with therapy dogs and other ani - mals, cookies with SLU President Dr. Fred P. Pestello and other events. There would be sev - eral more wellness days during the 2021-22 year, and similar days were added to the calendar for this academic year. Organizers continued to adapt the agenda based on student feedback. Participants join in a small group activity during Mental Health First Aid training. With a Little Help from My Friends Several student organizations revolve around well-being and mental health issues. Active Minds , a chapter of the national nonprofit that promotes mental health for young adults, has been at SLU since 2009. BALANCE provides a safe space for dialogue around mental health experiences that acknowledges the backgrounds of diverse populations.Make Dark Days Brighter offers workshops focused on wellness for students involved in the fine arts. The Green Bandana Project is SLU's chapter of The Bandana Project, a national movement for suicide prevention and mental health awareness.

Exceeding Expectations By Joe Barker \"We're a broader community of folks that might have varying levels of awareness and understanding, but we need to create a community of care,\" Anderson said. \"It's all part of building resilient Billikens,\" Harwood said. Harwood's job also involves prevention and outreach activities, which include educating students about alcohol and other drugs, stress management and self-care, and sexual assault and suicide prevention. She partners with Billikens After Dark, which sponsors late-night, alco - hol-free alternative programming; fraternities and sororities; and other student organizations. She also leads the Health Education Action Team (HEAT), a group of stu - dents passionate about health and wellness, who plan and implement \"fun programming with a side of education.\" \"Students want to listen to students,\" Harwood said. \"They take what the HEAT supervisors tell them better than if I were to say, 'Hey, you shouldn't drink so much.' It seems to come across better from someone their age who has been through the same experience.\" That sentiment is echoed in the words and work of Allison Twohig, a junior nursing major and director of The Green Bandana Project. The stu - dent organization is SLU's chapter of the national Bandana Project, which encourages solidarity around mental health issues. By wearing a green ban - dana, a student identifies as an advocate, someone who could be approached for help and resources. \"I got involved because it just seemed like a very simple thing. Now we have like 700 bandanas on campus,\" Twohig said. \"That's 700-plus stu - dents showing they care about mental health.\" Twohig's leadership earned her a 2022 Billiken Rising Star Award and the ear of the administration: She was asked to be one of a select few students on the Student Well-being Task Force. THE LONG VIEW The strategic and programmatic work of the task force continues to prog - ress, but there will always be the need to take the well-being pulse of cam - pus. Becoming a JED Campus helps the University evaluate its well-being initiatives. The Jed Foundation (JED) is a non - profit organization that works to protect emotional health and prevents suicide in adolescents and young adults. Its JED Campus program helps schools develop new programs, pol - icies and systems that build upon existing mental health, substance misuse and suicide prevention efforts. The four-year program has attracted nearly 400 colleges and universities, including Harvard, Princeton and New York universities, and Jesuit uni - versities such as Marquette and Xavier. \"It is a strategic relationship for an institution that says, we've been doing all of these things, and we want to make sure there's nothing we've missed,\" Cunningham said. SLU is part of JED's fall 2022 cohort. The first year began with the launch of the Healthy Minds Study on campus. The results will inform a strategic plan for student mental health and suicide preven - tion. As the University implements that plan, it has access to data from all the participating schools, as well as meetings with the rest of the cohort. In year four, SLU will complete the Healthy Minds Study again, providing a longi - tudinal look at campus well-being. At this point \u2014 as students still live amid what Jones-Johnson called \"a huge nexus of causation\" \u2014 it's clear that the University must implement both small and big changes to enhance well-being on campus. And the admin - istration, staff and faculty agree that they will do whatever it takes. \"We all have to do the work and make sure this is a place that's thriving,\" Harwood said. \"And it has to be systemic change. We can't think pro - gramming alone is going to work.\" Pestello has faith. \"Even as we struggle with the most difficult circumstances, the SLU community continues to inspire with its love, resilience and grace,\" he said. \"We will continue to care for one another, embrace our higher purpose and live our mis - sion.\" UTAS Twohig with her Green Bandana Project backpackCAMPAIGN NEWS WINTER 2023 19 To call Saint Louis University's Accelerating Excellence Campaign a success would be an understatement. Accelerating Excellence: The Campaign for Saint Louis University launched its public phase in November 2018 and was the first comprehensive fundraising campaign in SLU's history. The cam - paign set out to raise $500 million by the summer of 2022. On July 1, the University closed the books on the campaign and totaled up the contributions. The campaign not only reached its $500 million goal but soared past that number and ended with a total of $604 million raised.\"This is a historic achievement for Saint Louis University,\" said SLU President Dr. Fred P. Pestello. \"The Accelerating Excellence campaign has built momentum for our mission-driven work and created new possibilities for groundbreaking ini - tiatives in academics, medicine, research, athletics and service. The generosity of our donors will fuel an exciting, transformative future for SLU.\" Accelerating Excellence was intended to propel SLU to further national prominence as a Jesuit research university through investment in five strategic priorities: scholarships, academic excel - lence, business education, health sciences and athletics. The campaign was designed to impact all schools and colleges across the University. Exceeding ExpectationsExceeding Exceeding ExpectationsExpectationsThe Accelerating Excellence fundraising campaign shattered its goal. Exceeding Expectations \u2014 BY JOE BARKER20 UNIVERSITAS THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE OF SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY WINTER 2023 21CAMPAIGN NEWS \"The success of this campaign will provide support for many academic, research and student-focused areas,\" Provost Dr. Michael Lewis said. \"I am deeply grateful for our donors' commitment to scholarships and other support for students, and to enhancing fac - ulty work and advancing research across all colleges and schools. There will be a significant positive impact on our entire community. The generous gifts from our alumni and donors show how much they care about SLU and the future of the institution.\" The campaign was able to exceed its target even with the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Richard A. Chaifetz (A&S '75) said he had faith the campaign would meet its goal because of its strong start \u2014 by the summer of 2020 the campaign had raised more than $400 million, including sig - nificant donations from Chaifetz and his fellow campaign co-chair, Rex A. Sinquefield (CSB '67), both of whom are also SLU trustees. \"At the start of the campaign, I said that I wanted to improve Saint Louis University's stand - ing in the world, and I think this campaign has set SLU on that path,\" Sinquefield said. \"Achieving excellence benefits everyone, and that's just what this campaign set out to do. It's rewarding to see how many people got behind SLU's goals and are helping make those goals a reality.\" The campaign had a number of major contribu - tors. As co-chair, Chaifetz said part of his job was to encourage other parties to support the campaign. As a proud SLU alum, he said it wasn't a hard task. \"I'm a big believer in the school,\" he said. \"I live and breathe it. I think it's a tremendous university that is not as recognized as it should be in a lot of areas. I encourage students to go; I talk to parents and encour - age them to send their kids. It's pretty easy to be bullish on this place.\"Pestello said the campaign couldn't have reached its goal without contributions from everyone in the SLU community including alumni, faculty and staff. \"I want to thank everyone who helped make this campaign a success,\" he said. \"This achievement will make SLU a better university. With the resources this campaign generated, we will continue to recruit and retain exceptional faculty, staff and students. We will advance our students' accomplishments at SLU, and our alumni's success in their chosen careers. We will amplify our potential to serve and to produce scholar - ship that, in the Jesuit tradition, makes the world the way it ought to be.\" NOTABLE DEVELOPMENTS The campaign had several high-profile donations that led to some substantial developments. As part of the cam - paign, SLU saw the launch of the Saint Louis University Research Institute, a focal point for growing SLU's research capabil - ities and increasing research output. The institute was created through a historic gift from Dr. Jeanne and Rex Sinquefield. Two schools saw their name change during the campaign. The naming of the Richard A. Chaifetz School of Business was made in honor of gifts from Dr. Richard and Jill Chaifetz. The nursing school got a new name, the Trudy Busch Valentine School of Nursing, in recognition of philanthropic support from University trustee Trudy Busch Valentine (VSN '80). Funds raised during the campaign also led to the creation of a $10 million endowment for humanities education. FROM LEFT: Pestello, Manion, Sinquefield and Chaifetz at an event celebrating the successful conclusion of the campaign. The Taylor Geospatial Institute, a collaboration of eight research institutions focused on innovation in geospatial science and technology, supported by a legacy investment from Andrew C. Taylor, was estab - lished during Accelerating Excellence, as well. (See page 5.) Two new buildings also were made possible through campaign contributions. The Jesuit Center, a new residential facility and apostolic center on cam - pus that supports SLU's community of Jesuit priests, was finished this fall. (See page 32.) Still under con - struction is the O'Loughlin Family Champions Center, a 25,000-square-foot facility that will provide comprehensive interdisciplinary services to SLU's stu - dent-athletes and coaching staff. (See page 7.) BY THE NUMBERS The $604 million campaign was made possible by 190,402 gifts. The gifts led to four record-breaking fundraising years. A total of 98 donors made a campaign commitment of $1 million or more. That number includes bequest intentions, pledges and cash gifts. There were 3,077 faculty and staff donors who contributed $14,706,353. As a result of Accelerating Excellence, 416 new scholarships and awards were created. Of those, 281 were endowed. A total of 28 of the new scholarships have diversity, equity and inclusion criteria, and 290 are need-based. The campaign led to 36 newly endowed academic positions: 10 professorships, seven chairs, two dean - ships, seven lectureships and 10 fellowships. There also were 54 new funds created by donors that didn't fit into any of the categories but offer general support to SLU. Including scholarships, there were 535 new funds created overall. Accelerating Excellence led to the development of 19 new centers/institutes. Some existed before the campaign but were named by a donor during the fundraising effort. \"The goal of this campaign was a bold one,\" said Vice President for Development Sheila Manion. \"We asked our community to reach higher with us to strengthen SLU for decades to come, and our donors stepped up to support the University like never before. We are grate- ful for their enthusiastic participation and excited for the remarkable future their generosity enables. Any breakthroughs made possible by research funded by this campaign, any scholarships given to outstanding students who go forth to serve others, not only elevate SLU, they elevate the community. Every donor to the campaign shares in those successes.\" LOOKING FORWARD The Accelerating Excellence campaign may be over, but the fundraising doesn't stop. Chaifetz coined the Accelerating Excellence name and said it was intentional \u2014 it was meant to convey growth and not a finish line. \"We didn't say achieving excellence or anything final,\" he said. \"We're accelerating. It's a boost to getting to where we want to go. The journey is always there.\" Chaifetz wants to see more contributions to the University from his fellow alumni. \"I'm very proud of Saint Louis University,\" he said. \"I'm proud to be an alum. We should all be proud of our students' achievements. The best way to continue to promulgate that is to give money to areas that are important to you, so the University can continue to prosper. I would encourage all alums to do that. Without money, we can't do all the things necessary to achieve greatness. Accelerating Excellence is just the beginning. We want to be better than excellent, we want to be perfect \u2014 you can't get there, but you can try to get as close to perfect as you can.\" UTAS \"The generosity of our donors will fuel an exciting, transformative future for SLU.\" \u2014 DR.

Reczek is a flight controller at NASA's Mission Control in Houston, just a few years after his graduation from Saint Louis University with a bachelor's degree in aerospace, aeronautical and astronautical engineering. \"I can't believe that I've got the opportunity to train the astronauts, the first people who will go to the moon since 1972,\" Reczek said. After working for a NASA contractor, he started in late July as a full-time NASA civil servant working on planned Artemis missions aimed at landing astronauts on the moon in 2025. Today SLU graduates work in such diverse space endeavors as California-based SpaceX, NASA and the European Space Agency. Those space professionals said a Saint Louis University education prepared them for their challeng - ing careers in the dynamic industry. And with the 2022 debut of the School of Science and Engineering, home to programs formerly in Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology and four STEM departments from the College of Arts and Sciences, SLU will con - tinue to position future graduates for success in these rapidly evolving professions.EXPLORER // 1818SLU/1818111624 UNIVERSITAS THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE OF SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY WINTER 2023 25 DANIEL RECZEK Reczek is aware that he's the latest in a long line of SLU graduates who have served NASA and America's space program, including the legendary Gene Kranz (PC '54), flight direc - tor during the Gemini and Apollo programs. At NASA events, Reczek met Kranz, who is most famous for helping lead the Apollo 13 mission safely back to Earth after an explosion pre- vented it from landing on the moon. \"I think about the connection with Kranz a lot, and with the other Parks grads that have worked at NASA,\" Reczek said. \"There's never been such a huge volume of people and companies in space operations or space launches. What's happening in space today has never really happened before, and SLU graduates are involved in so much of it.\" Reczek said he never thought he'd be working in Mission Control so quickly after graduating. \"It helped that I came from Parks, and NASA has hired many graduates from there,\" he said. He recalls a NASA interviewer asking him what he thought he'd be doing in five years if he took the position. \"My answer was, I don't know because I thought this is what I'd be trying to do in five years,\" Reczek said. \"I feel really blessed to have been able to get a job here, right out of school.\" Since then, he's tried to network with aero - space students to let them know they can have their dream job if they just try for it. Experiences at SLU that helped prepare Reczek include building CubeSats, or very small satellites, as part of the University's Space Systems Research Lab and, perhaps surprisingly, working as events staff for SLU Athletics. \"Athletics events are fast-paced,\" Reczek said. \"I did everything from mopping the floor to run - ning free-throw contests. It turns out Mission Control is also a fast-paced environment, and NASA recognized the experience as valuable.\" He also credits his success to studying aero - space at SLU-Madrid and to mentors Dr. Michael Swartwout and Dr. Srikanth Gururajan, asso - ciate professors in aerospace and mechanical engineering. \"Working at NASA is much more achievable than you would think,\" Reczek said. \"We want all the SLU grads we can get.\" \"We talk a lot about how fast the space industry moves today, but to me it isn't so different from the speed of progress as we raced to the moon in the '60s,\" Posso said. \"The main difference is that, with 2000's tech, we can now reach similar speeds with a small fraction of the payroll.\" He believes humanity will reach a new \"golden age\" for space explora - tion when a permanent base on the moon or other celestial bodies becomes possible through mining and extraction of minerals, water, ice and other resources. Posso suggests students who want a career in space get involved in as many activities on campus as possible. He had worked on model rockets and CubeSats by the time he graduated. \"Clubs and organizations were extremely influential in my development as an engineer, and I am very thankful that I was encouraged and supported even to start my own. If there's one thing that makes candidates stand out, it is evidence of personal commitment to projects outside the classroom.\" Posso has a quick answer when asked if he'd go to Mars someday: \"Yes. Just not on a one-way trip.\" SILVIA BAY\u00d3N PEREZ At the European Space Agency, Silvia Bay\u00f3n Perez (PC '01, Grad PC '02) is helping plan missions to explore the solar system. From ESA's office in the Netherlands, Bay\u00f3n Perez leads the Solar System Mission Section, which investigates potential new missions to explore other worlds such as Venus, Mars, and Jupiter's and Saturn's moons. A fan of Mars exploration, she worked on the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter spacecraft that launched in 2016. A key goal of that mission was to analyze methane and other trace gases in the Martian atmosphere that could be evidence of possible life on the Red Planet. \"These are clearly exciting times for space exploration,\" she said. \"I think the paradigm has changed in the last few years in particular; there's a lot more interest from private investors and private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin, for example.\" Bay\u00f3n Perez attended classes at SLU's Madrid Campus and in St. Louis. She said her studies at SLU, while mostly focused on aeronautics, helped prepare her for a career in the space sector. \"I know things have evolved, and now there's a space research lab at SLU, and there are students who are building and launching CubeSats, so I'm very jealous of that experience in a way,\" she said. Hands-on activities are vital to an engineering program, she said, recalling her participation on SLU's team at the annual Design, Build, Fly contest for remote-controlled aircraft sponsored by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. After obtaining her bachelor's degree, she secured a grant to carry out work on her master's thesis as part of an official NASA program. That work described a mission that would take a greenhouse to Mars in preparation for a first human mission. She presented the results to engineers at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. SLU's international programs were vital to her education, she said. She remembers especially how the late Dr. Krishnaswamy \"Ravi\" Ravindra, for - mer associate dean at Parks, made international students feel at home on holidays such as Thanksgiving by inviting them to his house. GENE KRANZ The 1995 Apollo 13 movie depicted Kranz' central role during the infamous mission. Actor Ed Harris played Kranz, wearing his trademark white vest, a role that earned Harris a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Even in retirement, Kranz is still an eager student and sage of space exploration, having published a book about his career in 2000 called Failure Is Not an Option: Mission Control From Mercury to Apollo 13 and Beyond . He has been writ - ing a new book titled Tough and Competent , which he says will explore successful strategies and vision in the U.S. space program during Apollo and beyond. Kranz, who turned 89 years old in August, recalls that his father's death when he was just 7 years old prompted him to become independent and handy around the house, helping his mother by fixing appliances and other tedious mechanical jobs. \"I look at Parks and SLU as being one element of a series of experiences that pre - pared me to work in aerospace,\" Kranz said. \"Parks offered hands-on experiences. The miracle of Parks in those days was it had a small factory complex that built parts and maintained the airplanes we used at Parks Airfield.\" SLU moved Parks College from its former home in Cahokia, Illinois, to the main campus in St. Louis in 1997. Kranz said he thinks the move was good because it connects those students with a broader education at the larger campus. He said he was paired with older, experienced students who kept him focused and disciplined. That discipline also served him later as he became a U.S. Air Force pilot and tackled tough problems at NASA. \"People want to know why and how we pulled off the Apollo 13 rescue,\" Kranz said. \"It was because we had the total technical knowledge base because we wrote the manuals, we wrote the procedures, and we under - stood the spacecraft inside and out.\" Kranz received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University in 2015. MANUEL POSSO Manuel Posso (PC '12, Grad PC '14) is working for one of the newest space companies, Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has become the dominant commer - cial space launch provider. The company's Falcon rockets launched a new record of 31 orbital missions in 2021. Posso landed a job as an engineer at Boeing Co. when he graduated from SLU. After almost seven years, he moved to SpaceX as a senior launch engineer. He calls his education at SLU \"outstanding\" and said the Jesuit tradition influenced him as an engineer and a person. \"I wasn't just given a set of data and facts. I was also given the framework to make sense of the data and the facts within the context of human exis - tence. I learned to see light in darkness, to have the confidence to trust my instincts and to believe in humanity,\" Posso said. He's proud to be a part of a new chapter in space exploration, as NASA and commercial interests seek new milestones, such as landing on the moon again, establishing a base there and sending people to Mars, he said. Musk has made colonizing Mars the overarching goal of his business. What is a CubeSat? A CubeSat \u2014 short for cube satellite \u2014 is a small satellite that can take part in NASA's exploration, technology, educational and science investigations. The CubeSat was invented in 1999 when two professors in California wanted a way to provide affordable access to space for the university science community. Today, there are CubeSat programs at all levels of education, including in elementary schools. The satellites are developed in standardized sizes. The basic 1U CubeSat is a 10-centimeter cube with a mass of approximately 1 to 1.33 kilograms; a 3U CubeSat is about as big as a loaf of bread. Standardized sizing makes it possible for developers to use mass-market parts, which makes the whole enterprise more affordable and accessible. It typically takes 18-24 months to design, build, test and deliver a CubeSat. When it's ready, the satellite is attached to a launch vehicle via a dispenser, aiming to make it to orbit. SLU's Space Systems Research Laboratory has been working with CubeSats since 2009. COPPER, the first spacecraft developed by SLU students, entered the University Nanosat-6 Competition, which ran from 2009-11. In 2011, NASA selected COPPER for a sponsored launch under its Educational Launch of Nanosatellites Program. It launched in 2013. Another SLU CubeSat, the Argus-2, successfully launched into orbit from the International Space Station in February 2020.26 UNIVERSITAS THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE OF SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY WINTER 2023 27 LINDSEY JASPER Only a few years ago, Lindsey Jasper (PC '19) loved to collaborate on engineering homework assign - ments and sing on Sundays at St. Francis Xavier College Church. Now, she's helping to build and design satellites for the U.S. military's space surveillance network at Northrop Grumman in Virginia. \"Space is booming, and regardless of what sector you're in, it's such a great time to be an engineer or a scientist or a mathema - tician in this arena,\" Jasper said. Despite the hot job market, and great strides made toward more diver - sity in the field, Jasper still frequently finds herself as the only woman in a meeting or at an engineering event. She encourages women to get involved in aerospace, where she believes they have the best chance ever of getting hired in history. \"We've come really far, but we also have a really far way to go, and I do my best to make all the spaces that I work in welcoming and as diverse as possible,\" she said. Jasper is also grateful that she works at a time when powerful computing tools make many tasks easy that would have required days of work and lengthy calculations only decades ago. \"I have so many tools accessible to me that I use on a daily basis that are just infinitely more pow - erful,\" she said. \"With simulations, I can literally visualize my spacecraft, see where it's going, plug in the equations, and ultimately, just tell my computer what to do in a very simple and straightforward way. I'll even get a little video of what it's going to look like when it does that.\" Jasper said SLU allowed her to work directly on projects even as an under - graduate, which she believes is a unique benefit. \"As a freshman I was able to participate in a lab that built and designed CubeSats, and that was an absolute highlight of my education,\" she said. Her best memories are of the \"collaborative environment\" she discovered. \"We would wake up on a Saturday morning and go to a classroom and do homework together, even though that might sound super boring to some people,\" Jasper said. \"I found a group of people there that would legitimately look out for each other's best interests and help each other, which is one of the things that really contributed to my success.\" FERNANDO ABILLEIRA One of NASA's biggest achievements in recent years was the flawless landing of the sophisti - cated Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021. The mission had launched from Florida during the dark days of the pandemic despite work - place COVID-19 restrictions. Fernando Abilleira (PC '99, Grad PC '01) was deputy mission man - ager for the project, known as Mars 2020. Since its landing, the mission has confirmed new evidence of water action on the Red Planet and notched historic milestones for the first powered, controlled flight on another celes - tial body by the tiny, 4-pound Ingenuity. Now Abilleira is working on the next Mars objec - tive, the return of rock samples drilled by Perservance for study on Earth. \"Mars Sample Return will be the most tech - nically complex Mars mission to date,\" he said. The mission team is now planning to launch and land on Mars a robotic vehicle that will col - lect rock samples and launch them into Martian orbit, where they will be retrieved by another spacecraft and returned to Earth. Abilleira said he respects the work of previous generations that have allowed advancements in space exploration. He said being part of the Mars mission teams has been a privilege. \"We are sitting on the shoulders of giants. What the space pioneers did with a fraction of our technology level is nothing short of extraor - dinary. We went from being able to capture a very grainy black and white picture of another planet to recording our own landing on Mars. That is truly remarkable,\" he said. Abilleira said many professors and staff mem - bers at SLU had a \"great positive impact\" in his development, including the aforementioned Ravindra and Swartwout. As he looks to the future, Abilleira does have one caveat to his career trajectory. \"I would love to visit Mars,\" he said, \"but I would not leave Earth without my family and loved ones.\" UTAS Paul Brinkmann (A&S '89) is a journalist with more than 30 years of experience who has worked for the Orlando Sentinel and UPI, covering the space industry. He is now a writer at AIAA (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics) and its magazine Aerospace America . \"Space is booming, and regardless of what sector you're in, it's such a great time to be an engineer or a scientist or a mathematician in this arena.\" \u2014 JASPER28 UNIVERSITAS THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE OF SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY WINTER 2023 29 Overseeing an institution's collection of financial assets carries great responsibility . For Zoe Pezold (CSB '22) , it also carries great privilege . Pezold was among a prestigious group of undergraduate finance students given the responsibility of managing $2.5 million of Saint Louis University's endowment as part of an experiential learning course in the Richard A. Chaifetz School of Business. The Applied Portfolio Management (APM) course allows stu - dents, in consultation with industry mentors, the opportunity to learn about the intricacies of the stock market and equity research by directly steering the University's money. \"I did not take the responsibility lightly,\" Pezold said. \"I felt honored that the University trusted us with that much money and had faith that we could grow the portfolio and pass on that legacy to the next class.\" Doellman Finance students gain real-world experience by managing a portion of the University's endowment.30 UNIVERSITAS THE ALUMNI MAGAZINE OF SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY WINTER 2023 31 BUY, SELL, HOLD Each APM student analyzes a sector of the economy and two or three or stocks within that sector. Some of the stocks already may be in the University's port - folio; some are under consideration for inclusion. Working with their industry mentors, students are required to write two highly detailed, professional equity research reports. Each student must then defend their buy, sell or hold recommendations to their peers and professors in a formal presentation, followed by a 10-minute ques - tion-and-answer session. As part of their final project, the students work collaboratively to decide what, if any, changes will be made to the portfolio. The next class picks up where the previous class left off. Jacob Dowell (CBS '22), who took the APM course in 2021, chose the industrial sector and analyzed Honeywell (already in SLU's portfolio), Federal Signal and the Alamo Group. \"I was pretty grounded in the theoretical understanding of economics and finance, but until I took the APM course I didn't realize how it actually worked in the industry,\" Dowell said. \"It was interesting to see how financial analysts put together their reports and how much work goes into those reports.\" Pezold chose the communications services sector and ana - lyzed Disney, Netflix (both already in SLU's portfolio) and the video game company, Activision Blizzard. \"The hands-on experience helped me develop skills that only a select number of students have an opportunity to build,\" said Pezold, who also took the course in the fall of 2021. \"Most of us wouldn't be allowed to work with money of that magnitude until we entered the workforce, so I defi - nitely felt ahead of the game.\" EXPERT ADVICE The University introduced the APM course in the fall of 2002 with the initial class managing $500,000 of the University's endowment funds. In the two decades since then, the portfolio's value has grown to nearly $2.5 million. A 2016 dis - tribution from the portfolio helped fund the construction of the Edward Jones Data Analytics Lab, a state-of-the-art facility in the business school that houses 12 Bloomberg ter - minals, a computer system that allows students to access the Bloomberg data service with real-time global financial data and news feeds. In 2020, Dr. Thomas Doellman, associate professor of finance, enriched the experience by recruiting industry mentors to work one-on-one with the students. Each stu - dent is paired with an equity analyst from one of St. Louis' top financial firms, including Asset Consulting Group LLC, Edward Jones, Kennedy Capital Management, Wells Fargo and NISA Investment Advisors LLC. Students and mentors meet an average of once a week for an hour. \"Many business schools have APM courses, but this men - toring program is unique to SLU,\" Doellman said. \"It's powerful and exciting for students to have that connection to the industry, to see that what they're doing in the class - room is 100% what they will be doing in the industry.\" Larry Pfeffer (CSB '10), an equity sector ana - lyst at Wells Fargo in St. Louis, took the APM course during his senior year while interning at a financial institution. He said the course was the single most valuable class of his undergrad - uate education. \"With an internship, you get exposure to peo - ple who have experience,\" he said. \"You see what it's like to work in a given firm, and you might be asked to assist with tasks that involve real- world work, but your level of decision-making is minimal. With the APM course, you have some guardrails around you, such as your professor and your classmates who offer opinions, but you're making up your own mind.\" Pfeffer said he chose to volunteer as a mentor in part because his Jesuit education encouraged giving back and because he saw it as an oppor - tunity to stay humble. \"This industry can be really tough, and going back to the beginning by working with students keeps you grounded,\" Pfeffer said. \"It's import - ant to be mindful of where everybody starts, and I can't think of a better way to do that than through an experience like this. And sometimes a student will surprise me by asking questions I hadn't even considered.\" Since launching the mentorship program two years ago, Doellman said there are more equity analysts offering to volunteer than he has APM students. BULL MARKET Demand is high for the limited number of APM seats, and the application process is rig - orous. Students are required to submit names of references, essays and academic transcripts. While 30 or more students typically apply for the innovative learning experience, only 15 to 18 students are accepted into the one-semester, three-credit-hour course each fall. Dr. Naresh Bansal, chair and professor in the department of finance, said placement is coveted, but the course is not for everyone. He advises applicants in advance that it is aca - demically demanding. The extensive research that goes into the analysis of a company and the preparation needed for communicating insight to a room full of peers, professors and investment professionals requires tremendous preparation. \"We let them know that this course places a huge responsibility on their shoulders and requires a level of commitment greater than what they may be accustomed to,\" he said. \"If they are not ready to put in many, many hours of work outside the classroom, they should walk away.\" Pezold said she spent more than 120 hours outside the classroom working on her APM assignments. Dowell also recalls putting an immense amount of time into his reports. \"It's definitely a ton more work than my other courses,\" he noted, \"but it was proportionally more insightful and useful.\" BENCHMARKS Bansal said ample anecdotal evidence demonstrates the positive impact of APM on student success. He noted that APM students have \"stellar placements,\" upon graduation. All 2021 APM alumni secured jobs or advanced to higher education. Pezold interviewed with multiple companies and received several offers before deciding to join Equifax. Dowell was accepted into the doctoral program in finance at Boston College, where he plans to conduct research in investment theory. Bansal said leading investment firms contact him regularly looking to hire APM alumni or students considered to be APM material. Bansal said APM students also led the University to success in the annual Chartered Financial Analyst Institute's global research challenge. Teams of three-to-five students from participating universities are assigned to ana - lyze publicly traded companies, prepare a written report on their assigned company and recommend whether to buy, sell or hold the stock. Teams pres - ent their findings to a panel of industry experts, and winners are selected based on the students' knowledge and equity analysis. The University entered two teams composed of 2021 A P M s t u d e n t s , including Dowell and Pezold, in the competition. Under the direction of Doellman and Bansal, the teams placed first and sec - ond in the St. Louis regional competi - tion \u2014 a first for the University. Dowell's team also was one of only 17 teams to advance to the Americas regional competition, which included teams from South, Central and North America. It is the farthest a SLU team ever has advanced in the competition. Another bonus for students that positions them for success: APM is a required course for students in the financial analysis track. And the rigorous curriculum covers 70% of the material on the Chartered Financial Analyst Level 1 Exam \u2014 the first of three exams needed for an a to be credentialed as a CFA. Bansal and Doellman received the dean's 2022 Curriculum Innovation Grant for their cultivation of the APM course, the finance department's flagship program in experiential learning and student success. They plan to use the financial award as seed capital to establish the APM fund to support student scholarships. THE FINAL DECISION Based on Pezold's analysis and recommen - dations, the 2021 APM class chose to keep Disney and Netflix stock in SLU's portfolio and increased the portfolio's weight in the com - munication services sector. Based on Dowell's recommendations, the students chose to replace Honeywell with Federal Signal and increased the portfolio's weight in the industrial sector.

But Saint Louis University is not just any university, Mehan explained. It is a Jesuit university, and SLU's Jesuit community is now centered in the heart of campus. Construction of Saint Louis University's Jesuit residence was completed over the summer. Jesuits missioned as professors, pastors and staff members at the University moved into the facility near Spring Hall along Laclede Avenue beginning Aug. 1. \"One of the things we've really missed (during construction) is the fact that the University Jesuit community has been scat - tered around town,\" said David Suwalsky, S.J., vice president of mission and identity at SLU. \"Being able to share meals together, to celebrate Mass together and to live in community is so important.\" Having a strong Jesuit presence on campus was also import - ant to Marian \"Bo\" (Vatterott) Mehan (VSN '74, Law '82), the vice chair of SLU's board of trustees. She remembers the num - ber of Jesuits on campus during her time at SLU and what an impression they made upon her. \"They were front and center in so many ways. You didn't have to think about how important they are to the University. You saw them everywhere,\" she said. \"The new Jesuit residence affirms that \u2014 it puts our Jesuits right in the middle of the action.\" The Jesuit residence creates a space for enhanced interac - tion between SLU's Jesuits and the wider community. The facility has 20 bedrooms for SLU Jesuits and five for guests. It also has a chapel, dining space and meeting rooms. The chapel and first-floor meeting rooms are open for use by the commu - nity. Several student weeknight Masses, previously held in residence halls, have moved to the new chapel. \"There was no one single place where all of the Jesuits con - nected to the University worked, lived and could be found,\" Timothy McMahon, S.J., SLU trustee and rector of SLU's Jesuit community, said. \"Here, you can see the spire of the chapel. You can see the building, and you know that's where the Jesuits are and that they're here.\" Suwalsky noted that the new facility keeps SLU competitive for Jesuit assignments. The Jesuit provinces have made it clear that assignments will be based on strong resources available to the priests and Jesuit communities committed to and cre- ated on college campuses. The new Jesuit residence keeps SLU well-positioned for future growth by creating both a home for the University's Jesuits and a place for the community to gather with them. Michael Rozier, S.J. (A&S '03), assistant professor and chair of health management and policy in the College for Public Health and Social Justice, said his exposure to the Jesuit community at SLU during his undergraduate years led him to service. \"I would not be a Jesuit today if it weren't for the Jesuits I met as an undergraduate student over two decades ago,\" he said. \"My vocation, my very being, is grounded in those relationships.\" Rozier added that he hoped the central location of the residence on campus would allow for increased interaction between the Jesuit community, faculty members and students. Those interactions carry meaning for Terry Mehan, even 40 years after from his time at SLU. \"The Jesuits added a richness to campus life,\" he said, add - ing that the tenets of Ignatian spirituality he learned at SLU stayed with him and have been beneficial in his everyday life. A NEW BEGINNING SLU Jesuits and other members of the Society of Jesus have resided in Jesuit Hall since 1973. In 2020, former Jesuit Provincial Ronald Mercier, S.J., confirmed a plan to create two new communities from Jesuit Hall: One designed for retired Jesuits and those who need medical support, and the second for Jesuits working at the University. \"It was really important to us on the board of trustees that we remain committed to our mission and values,\" Bo Mehan said. \"This new facility is a statement and a commitment to our Jesuits for years to come.\" The Saint Louis University community and members of the Jesuits Central and Southern Province broke ground on the new residence in April 2021. University President Dr. Fred P. Pestello noted when the project was announced that the decision to locate the residence on campus followed SLU's strategic priority to strengthen its Catholic and Jesuit mission. \"For many, many years, the Jesuits carried Saint Louis University on their backs from every perspective \u2014 from the business perspective, the educational perspective, the finan - cial, the spiritual,\" Bo Mehan said. \"It's our turn to take some of that load on our backs, and I think this building really helps do that.\" The facility was designed by HKW Architects, and BSI Constructors Inc. served as the general contractor. SLU was awarded a $2 million challenge grant from the J.E. and L.E. Mabee Foundation toward the construction of the residence. The Mabee Foundation funds new construction, building renovations and the purchase of major medical equipment. It limits its grants to brick-and-mortar projects located in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arkansas, Missouri and Kansas. It was formed in 1948 by Missouri natives and Oklahoma res - idents John and Lottie Mabee. The couple also wanted to encourage others to give, and so crafted the foundation grants as challenge grants that both require and inspire widespread public support. Members of SLU's board of trustees officially opened the facility during Homecoming 2022, and the chapel was conse - crated in October.

BRYAN BEASLEY Sports fans rely on the stats, data and history that broadcasters share, but the announcers don't pull that information off the tops of their heads. They rely on people like Bryan Beasley (CSB '11). Beasley is a senior researcher on SportsCenter , which won the 2020- 21 Sports Emmy for Outstanding Studio Show Daily. He also works on NFL studio shows. Beasley collaborates with produc - ers, graphics producers, the features group and on-air talent. He uses broad and deep sports knowledge to ensure the accuracy of live news and informa - tion for studio, event and digital coverage. His responsibilities include researching original content for full-screen graphics, anchor lead-ins and original pieces. \"It's great to work with longtime talent like Chris Berman, who I grew up watch - ing on NFL Countdown and NFL PrimeTime ,\" he said. Though Beasley always wanted to work in the compet - itive sports industry, he admits he hadn't always wanted to be a researcher. At Saint Louis University, Beasley studied business administration with a concentration in economics and envisioned becoming an athletic direc - tor at a college or a sports agent in one of the major leagues. His analytical mindset and knack for numbers led him down a different path.He used microeconomics and statistics to analyze sports business. He studied profit maximization, revenue sharing, competitive balance and collective bar - gaining \u2014 skills that would serve him later in his career. \"I was interested in Saint Louis University because of the opportunities at the business school,\" he said. Those oppor - tunities included hands-on experiences. As a member of SLU's Delta Sigma Chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi, a professional business fraternity, Beasley networked with prominent local busi - ness people. And he assisted a sports eco - nomics professor with research on a consult - ing project for the 2011 Super Bowl in Dallas. He also played tennis for the Billikens, competing in Atlantic 10 conference tournaments and \"scrappy\" matchups against rivals such as Xavier University. \"Playing tennis has given me an incredible outlook on life and great lessons about failure, persistence, ver - satility, flexibility and never thinking you're above other people,\" he said.After SLU, Beasley pur - sued graduate work at the University of San Francisco, another Jesuit institution. While there, he was a public relations intern for the Oakland Raiders during the 2011 season. He weathered the NFL's highs and lows, including a lockout and the death of the team's longtime owner and general man - ager Al Davis. \"My interest in the NFL wasn't as big until I started the internship,\" he said. After earning a master's degree in sports management at USF, he started working as a data analyst for Nielsen Sports, formerly Repucom. That position led him to ESPN in 2014. In addition to his SportsCenter duties, Beasley leads tennis coverage at ESPN. He's attended two Wimbledon Championships in London and the U.S. Open every year since 2015. He also helped cover the NFL Draft in Las Vegas, the 100th running of the Indianapolis 500 in 2016, Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta, and talk show First Take during the 2017 NBA All-Star Weekend in New Orleans. \"The choice to attend SLU was the best decision I ever made,\" he said. \"It was the foundation of my success. \" \u2014 By Bridjes O'NeilALUMNI SPOTLIGHT Beasley on the set of ESPN's SportsCenter \"The choice to attend SLU was the best decision I ever made.

HAPPY 60TH SLU broke ground on Griesedieck Memorial Hall on March 5, 1962, and welcomed its first residents for the fall 1963 semester. The landmark hall was part of the $18 million Priority Needs Campaign, the first phase of the University's 150th Anniversary Development Program. ROOM FOR ALL \"Gries\" was conceived as a tower between Walsh and Clemens halls to house SLU's increasing number of out-of-town students. The building would add living quarters for 414 students, giving the U-shaped complex a total capacity of 853. FAMILY NAME The Griesediecks immigrated from Germany to St. Louis and operated several successful breweries. Alvin Griesedieck Sr., president of Falstaff Brewing Corp., was chairman of SLU's Firms and Corporations Council before he died in 1961; a lounge on the ground level of Gries was named in his honor. CAMPUS LANDMARK At 16 stories with 14 residential floors, Griesedieck Hall is the tallest building on campus. During past winter holiday seasons, select indoor lights have been left on strategically to create an illuminated cross visible from nearby Interstate 64. BLUE-LIGHT SPECIAL Twenty-five years ago, a lighted \"Saint Louis University\" was affixed to the top of Griesedieck; the switch first was flipped on June 24, 1997. Each blue letter measures six feet tall, and the length of the sign is 88 feet. BOLAND PLAZA The outdoor area in front of Griesedieck was called Boland Plaza after Joseph Boland, S.J., who lived in SLU's residence halls from 1946 after his Naval duty until he died in 1979. A 2004 renovation annexed the plaza space to double the size of the building's dining hall, which now is home to the Career Lab. J.
