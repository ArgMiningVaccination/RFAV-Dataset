It's heart disease\u2014not breast cancer\u2014that women need to worry about Most women fear breast cancer, but heart disease is actually the No. 1 killer for women, causing one in three deaths each year, according to the American Heart Association. Women's heart health risks increase after menopause, yet just one in five American women believe that heart disease is her greatest threat to her health. Here are [15 heart attack prevention tips every woman must know](https://www.thehealthy.com/heart-disease/heart-attack-prevention/). Heart attacks look a whole lot different on TV A man grabs his chest and falls to the floor\u2014everyone has seen this type of heart attack on TV and in the movies, but that's not always what it looks or feels like in women. For women, the most common heart attack symptom is chest pain or discomfort, but they are more likely to experience shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and back or jaw pain, according to the American Heart Association. Here are some more [ways that heart disease is different in women.](https://www.thehealthy.com/heart-disease/heart-attack-symptoms-women/) You're more likely to survive a heart attack if your doctor is a woman too A study of close to 582,000 heart attacks over 19 years found that women had a significantly higher survival rate when a female doctor treated them in the emergency room. The findings are published in the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/34/8569). \"You have highly trained experts with life or death on the line, and yet the gender match between the physician and the patient seems to matter a great deal,\" says Seth Carnahan, associate professor of strategy at the Olin Business School of Washington University in St. Louis, in a [news release](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/08/180806152045.htm). Exercising now will slash your risk of dementia Move it or lose it, literally. This is the main message of a [study](http://n.neurology.org/content/neurology/early/2018/03/14/WNL.0000000000005290.full.pdf) in Neurology that found women who are physically fit at middle age are nearly 90 percent less likely to develop dementia decades later, compared to women who are moderately fit. \"These findings are exciting because it's possible that improving people's cardiovascular fitness in middle age could delay or even prevent them from developing dementia,\" says study author Helena H\u00f6rder, PhD, of the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, in a news release. But, she cautions, \"this study does not show cause and effect between cardiovascular fitness and dementia, it only shows an association. More research is needed to see if improved fitness could have a positive effect on the risk of dementia and also to look at when during a lifetime a high fitness level is most important.\" Morning people may be less likely to develop breast cancer Are you an early riser? If so, you may be less likely to develop breast cancer. Women who are \"morning people\" have a lower for risk breast cancer, according to research presented at the 2018National Cancer Research Institute Cancer Conference. The study also found that women who sleep more may have higher chances of developing breast cancer. While more research is needed to confirm these results, the findings \"are consistent with previous research...[on] exposure to 'light-at-night' as risk factors for breast cancer,\" says Rebecca Richmond, PhD, a research fellow in the Cancer Research UK Integrative Cancer Epidemiology Programme and the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol, United Kingdom, in a [news release](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/11/181105200733.htm). These [50 everyday habits may lower your chances of developing breast cancer](https://www.thehealthy.com/cancer/breast-cancer/habits-that-reduce-risk-of-breast-cancer/). You're not off the hook for mammograms after age 75 If you're still in good health, you should probably still get screened, according to the [Harvard Health Letter](https://www.health.harvard.edu/screening-tests-for-women/should-you-still-have-mammograms-after-age-75). Although there has been some back and forth on this issue. The American Cancer Society says: \"Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer.\" One reason to continue is the comparatively high incidence of breast cancer found in this age group, according to research presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). Here are some [questions to ask if your mammogram results are abnormal.](https://www.thehealthy.com/cancer/breast-cancer/abnormal-mammogram/) Adding soy to your diet can strengthen your bones It's not just calcium and vitamin D that can help shore up your skeleton: Soy-based whole foods such as tofu and soy milk may also do the trick, [find researchers](https://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2018/0807-soy-diets-might-increase-womens-bone-strength-according-to-new-university-of-missouri-research/) out of the University of Missouri-Columbia. Snoring is hard on your heart Yes, your husband's snoring drives you mad, but your own snoring may be bad for your ticker. Obstructive sleep apnea, which is marked by heavy snoring, gasping, and pauses in breathing while asleep, may lead to heart problems in women\u2014and they can turn up earlier than the effects on men's hearts, according to a new [study](https://press.rsna.org/timssnet/media/pressreleases/14_pr_target.cfm?ID=2055) presented at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America. The findings also suggest that sleep apnea may be vastly underdiagnosed among snorers. Here are some [silent signs of sleep apnea that you may be ignoring](https://www.thehealthy.com/sleep/sleep-apnea/sleep-apnea-symptoms/). HRT isn't all bad Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) fell from grace a few years back: Results from the U.S. Women's Health Initiative study suggested HRT could increase the risk of strokes and breast and ovarian cancer. However, if HRT is used in low doses for a short period of time, it can dramatically ease some symptoms of menopause, explains Donnica Moore, MD, a Far Hills, New Jersey-based women's health expert and host of the podcast In the Ladies' Room with Dr. Donnica. \"HRT is not one drug. It is a whole category, including pills, patches, creams, gels, inserts and more,\" she says. Her point is that some formulations are may be safer and suitable for easing the complaints of menopause. \"Fully half of all women experience vaginal dryness with menopause and this doesn't get better and it is treatable.\" You may benefit more than most from a low-salt diet Cutting back on sodium may lower blood pressure in women better than it does in men. Women also might benefit most from drugs that directly block aldosterone, a hormone and blood vessel constrictor that is naturally higher in females and is further elevated by a high-salt diet, according to a [report](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.118.11303) in the journal Hypertension. Watch for the [signs you need to cut back on salt](https://www.thehealthy.com/nutrition/too-much-sodium/). You're not the only one Millions of women can't control that \"gotta go\" feeling (urge incontinence) or leak during exercise or when they sneeze or cough (stress incontinence), and this risk increases after menopause. \"It's common but not normal, and any leaking of urine should be evaluated and treated,\" Dr. Moore says. Here are [10 things you can do about stress incontinence](https://www.thehealthy.com/incontinence/stress-incontinence-treatment/). Your menopause symptoms could be a relationship issue Women who are emotionally abused by a spouse or partner may suffer from more menopausal symptoms than their counterparts in healthier relationships. Specifically, one in five women in the study of more than 2,000 women at mid-life and older had suffered emotional abuse by a current or former partner; these women had 50 percent higher odds of night sweats and 60 percent higher odds of painful sex. \"The data show that experience of domestic violence and emotional abuse, sexual assault and clinically significant PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) symptoms are common, and may affect women's health across the lifespan,\" says first author Carolyn Gibson, PhD, a clinical research psychologist affiliated with the University of California at San Francisco's Department of Psychiatry, in a news release. The triple threat is real Smoking, diabetes and high blood pressure are all bad for the heart, but they may be even worse for women's hearts, new [research](https://www.bmj.com/content/363/bmj.k4708) shows. Of 472,000 Britons aged 40 to 69, women experienced the highest increase in heart attack risk\u2014though both sexes suffered. Specifically, male smokers had more than twice the risk of heart attack than men who had never smoked, and women smokers had more than three times the risk of heart attack compared to never-smokers. This same trend was seen with high blood pressure and diabetes. Here are the [23 ways to stop smoking](https://www.thehealthy.com/addiction/smoking/quit-smoking/). Your sleeping position matters Stomach and side sleeping positions can cause wrinkles over time, and this effect gets worse as you age thanks to the natural thinning of your skin, according to a study in [Aesthetic Surgery Journal.](http://asj.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/20/asj.sjw074) Most sleep wrinkles can be seen on the forehead, lips, and cheeks. If you can tolerate it, sleeping on your back can help slow the wrinkles. Here are more [tips on how to get your beauty sleep](https://www.rd.com/health/beauty/overnight-beauty-products/). Dementia is not a given More than one-third of dementia cases could be prevented or significantly delayed by addressing lifestyle-based risk factors such as learning to eat right and engaging in regular exercise, according to the newly launched health initiative, [Be Brain Powerful: A Campaign for Women's Brain Health](https://bebrainpowerful.org/). Here are [50 everyday habits that can reduce your risk of dementia](https://www.thehealthy.com/alzheimers/how-to-prevent-alzheimers/). Alzheimer's is a woman's issue Almost two-thirds of Americans with Alzheimer's are women, and more than 60 percent of Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers are women, according to Jill Lesser, the president of [Women Against Alzheimer's](https://www.usagainstalzheimers.org/). \"Women are very interested in brain health and very aware of brain health and the issues surrounding cognitive decline, but are very confused about what to do about it and still very scared,\" she says. The [30-Day Brain Health Challenge](https://bebrainpowerful.org/) involves emailing simple tips on boosting brain health daily for 30 days to get women started on the right path. Keep up with the girls nights Staying engaged with friends and connected to a community can help prevent cognitive decline, Lesser says. \"There is an increasing amount of evidence that community engagement can protect the brain so try to do activities\u2014such as eating and exercising\u2014with others.\" Check out [50 science-backed ways to ward off loneliness](https://www.thehealthy.com/mental-health/how-to-not-feel-lonely/). You really are what you eat Planning a healthy diet that's rich in good fats, dark leafy greens, berries, and fish may help protect your noggin, Lesser says. Diets that limit carbs can also boost brain health. \"Your brain needs healthy fats, and fewer sugars and carbs.\" Talk to your doctor or a dietitian about what style of eating is best for you. Stick to a bedtime Most of us haven't had a real bedtime since childhood, but Dr. Moore says it's time to re-institute one. \"Getting adequate sleep is highly underappreciated as a health issue in women after 50, and setting and sticking to a regular bedtime can help make sure you are getting enough\u2014just like it did when you were a kid.\" The Office on Women's Health in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that women aged 50 and older get at least seven to eight hours of sleep per night. You can still get pregnant If you haven't officially entered menopause, you can still become pregnant, and you may need to use birth control, Dr. Moore says. Menopause is diagnosed when a woman hasn't had her period for 12 straight months for no other obvious reasons, and most women enter menopause at age 51. Losing weight is tougher after 50 It's time to start watching what you eat a little more closely\u2014and maybe add an exercise day to your week. As women hit menopause, their metabolism can slow, making it an uphill battle to lose weight. Check out [these 50 expert-approved tips for weight loss after 50](https://www.thehealthy.com/weight-loss/ways-lose-weight-after-50/). You need protein to boost your muscle strength Another reason your metabolism slows after 50 is that muscle mass declines with age. Eating an equal amount of protein at all three meals may help boost muscle strength in people older than 67, according to a [study](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/106/1/113/4634030) published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Cardio is no longer enough Add some strength training to your workout regimen after 50 to help lose weight, advises Louis J. Aronne, MD, an obesity medicine specialist with The Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. Because you're losing that muscle mass, it's more difficult to maintain your weight, he explains. Resistance exercise can help preserve your muscles. Here are the [exercises you should modify](https://www.thehealthy.com/exercise/exercises-to-modify-over-50/) though, if you're over the age of 50. Falling is a real risk It's not just the elderly who are in danger of falls and fractures: New [research](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0201989) finds that falls become more common after the age of 40\u2014particularly in women. Falling is more dangerous than you think\u2014it's one of the leading causes of hospitalization and mortality in the elderly, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/falls/adultfalls.html).

You may need more D Vitamin D is known as the sunshine vitamin because our bodies produce it in response to sunlight. In recent years, low levels of this key nutrient have been linked to a host of diseases and conditions including metabolic syndrome among postmenopausal women. In one [study](https://www.maturitas.org/article/S0378-5122%2817%2930628-X/fulltext), there was a 60 percent rate of metabolic syndrome\u2014a collection of dangerous conditions like high cholesterol and blood pressure\u2014seen among women with vitamin D deficiency. Get the [facts about metabolic syndrome.](https://www.thehealthy.com/weight-loss/stevia-help-prevent-metabolic-syndrome/) Eat for your heart and mind If something good for your heart, it's good for your brain too, says Suzanne Steinbaum, DO, the Director of Women's Cardiovascular Prevention, Health, and Wellness at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. \"Heart-healthy foods and habits are also brain healthy.\" Your numbers matter Knowing your cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, weight, and body-mass index (a combo of your height and weight) are crucial by the time you reach 50, Dr. Steinbaum says. Making sure that these numbers are in the healthy range will go a long way toward protecting your heart and brain as you age, she says. Your heart is not your mom's heart Just because your mom had heart disease doesn't mean you will too. This is why It's important to know your family health history, Dr. Steinbaum says: \"The more you understand about your history, the more you can fight against it,\" she says. \"Heart disease is preventable as much as 80 percent of the time, and the sooner we start prevention, the more effective it will be.\" Don't drink like a man Even if you can, you shouldn't\u2014women who go drink-for-drink with their male counterparts are at greater risk of dementia, alcohol-related cancers (like breast), and heart issues, according to the [American Heart Association (AHA)](https://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/HealthyEating/Nutrition/Alcohol-and-Heart-Health_UCM_305173_Article.jsp#.WmJbXJM-fOQ). The group recommends women stick to one drink per day maximum (men can have two). A drink is one 12 oz. beer, 4 oz. of wine, 1.5 oz. of 80-proof spirits, or 1 oz. of 100-proof spirits. Your pregnancy history still matters If you have a history of miscarriages or you developed diabetes or high blood pressure during pregnancy, you may be at an increased risk of heart disease later in life. \"Your cardiac risks are based on your whole life,\" Dr. Steinbaum says. You are more prone to anxiety Unfortunately, anxiety and anxiety disorders continue to pester women as they age\u2014they're among the higher risk groups, according to a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4951626/) in Brain and Behavior.
