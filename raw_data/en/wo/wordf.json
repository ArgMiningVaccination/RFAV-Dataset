As sophisticated biotechnologies capable of augmenting the human body's capacities, vaccinations are an instance of Human Enhancement (HE): The effort to use technologies to improve humans. Global vaccination efforts against SARS-CoV-2 evoke public concerns similar to those in the general HE debate, namely, naturalness and invasiveness. We explore these variables and their connection to vaccination behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted an online survey (N = 314 persons) with 256 participants (81.5%) vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and n = 58 (18.5%) not vaccinated. Participants answered questions concerning their attitudes on nature and naturalness, willingness to use cognitive enhancement methods, HE, psychological effects of vaccination, and planned vaccination. Several Bayesian regression models were constructed to predict the willingness to use cognitive enhancement, attitudes toward vaccinations and HE, and whether people plan for further vaccination doses. Results: Participants were more willing to use methods to improve cognitive abilities if considered natural, non-invasive, and not used frequently. A less a\u0000rmative attitude toward naturalness was also associated with more willingness to use. Effects were primarily moderated by vaccination status. Vaccinated and unvaccinated participants differed substantially, especially in measures that re\u0000ected the attitude toward naturalness and related phenomena. Participants did not assess vaccinations as a prime example of HE. Rating of vaccination as enhancement did not reliably predict attitude on vaccination nor HE. More a\u0000rmative attitudes toward naturalness and not being vaccinated were negatively associated with the attitude toward vaccinations and HE. A positive attitude toward HE predicted a more positive attitude toward vaccinations. Support of disease control measures and attitude toward vaccinations positively predicted vaccination intention. Receiving the vaccination led to psychological relief. Conclusions: Motives of vaccination and HE refusal appear to be linked. Interventions considered unnatural and invasive are deemed unfavorable. These reasons seem more pronounced for unvaccinated participants. If HE, e.g., vaccination, constitutes an essential public health measure, concerns about the human relationship to nature, perceived naturalness, and sanctity of the human body must be su\u0000ciently and thoughtfully addressed. Introduction Vaccinations (technological modi\u0000cations of the individual body) are important in defeating pandemics such as COVID-19 (emerged in late 2019). Effective at the end of 2022, the World Health Organization reports that approximately 67.5% of the population of Europe and parts of Asia (e.g., Russia, Turkey, Kazakhstan) have at least received one dose of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 [1]. In Germany (for the same time), ~85% of the population older than 18 years have received at least one dose of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 [2]. Longitudinal data provided by German authorities shows that since early 2022, the vaccination rate nearly stagnates [3]. So, even after an extended availability of different vaccines with various technologies (e.g., inactivated, vector, or mRNA vaccines), some people remain skeptical and refuse to be vaccinated. A phenomenon that cannot be fully reduced to an alleged end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination hesitancy can have fatal consequences, as the struggle against pandemics demands collaborative action [4] and compliance with disease control measures. Vaccination is not only a medical but a complex social issue. Tensions between individual opinions and scienti\u0000c insights fuel the public discourse revolving around it. In scienti\u0000c and public discussions, how we talk about technical concepts matters [5]. Experts and laypeople can have diverging models and assessments of the functioning and risks of vaccination [6, 7]. In the notoriously passionate discourse about vaccination, academic expertise is rivaled by a highly agile anti-vaccination movement that, prima facie, appears valid but does not follow the standards that academic science has imposed on itself [8, 9]. This forges the danger of derailing a public discussion by fostering notions and ideas that do not stand up to empirical scrutiny but can be pivotal for individual decisions. Citizens who are to be convinced to comply with disease control measures are required to \u0000lter relevant information. Stakeholders who help design or communicate the means for these measures are interested in making their message stick and enhancing compliance. To that end, it was suggested to attune vaccination advertisement campaigns to the moral foundation and worldview of the audience [10, 11]. Crucial to this is an understanding of the subject matter that goes beyond a super\u0000cial notion of vaccination as a disease-\u0000ghting measure everyone should be happy to embrace. Instead, recognize how vaccination is an example of a highly controversial concept. Vaccinations are biotechnology that enhances the human body's given capacity. In this regard, vaccination can be classi\u0000ed as an instance of Human Enhancement [12], a term used to describe techno-scienti\u0000c interventions intended to create improved, optimized, or even \"better\" humans [13-15]. The ethical arguments around this issue are notoriously utopian or dystopian [15- 17]. Yet, many historical and contemporary technologies either increase an aspect of their human users or grant them a new capability and qualify as Human Enhancement [12, 18, 19]. Albeit often framed in a science-\u0000ctional manner, Human Enhancement is actually widely used and a fundamental aspect of how we live [20]. We suspect that reservations against vaccinations, most recently against SARS-CoV-2, are linked to the arguments leveled against the overarching concept of Human Enhancement. The present study aims to empirically connect attitudes towards vaccination and vaccination behavior with the debate about and attitudes toward Human Enhancement. The COVID-19 pandemic offers an opportunity to investigate vaccination behavior in an urgent and global context and therefore shine new light on the practical nature of Human Enhancement in action. A more differentiated perspective on vaccination as an instance of Human Enhancement can improve our understanding of both phenomena and inform the public discourse on two highly polarizing issues. Rationale Albeit studies usually do not assess attitudes toward Human Enhancement and vaccination together, many links can be found in the empirical literature. To properly assess these \u0000ndings, one must remember that Human Enhancement is an umbrella term for a wide range of interventions [21, 22]. Vaccination,Page 3/27being a critical issue on its own, is inevitably related to Human Enhancement due to its features of employing technology to improve human capacities [12]. Although vaccination is not usually explicitly referred to as \"Human Enhancement,\" motifs that drive opposing both phenomena may be very similar. For instance, some consider the technological process of introducing synthetic biology in vaccination development as an act of \"playing God\" [6], an all too familiar accusation raised when discussing speci\u0000c Human Enhancements and their biotechnological realization [23-27]. (Perceived) Naturalness It has been revealed that people are more reluctant to use cognitive enhancement if means are framed as unnatural or individual concerns about unnaturalness are present [28, 29]. Regarding individual moral foundations, studies have shown that purity concerns, i.e., an aversion against acts considered 'unnatural,' play a crucial role in the negative evaluation of cognitive Enhancement [30, 31] and vaccination [10]. Naturalness bias and the belief that natural immunity is superior to vaccination hinder vaccination intention and behavior [32-35]. The question of perceived unnaturalness is also prevalent in online discourse among vaccination critics [8, 9]. But as with Human Enhancement [21], there is conceptual confusion about what naturalness means. Accordingly, the term may refer to the properties of an object or describe its history [11, 36]. Inconsistent use of the term may contribute to differences in how experts and laypersons understand it in the context of vaccination [6]. We encounter a somewhat similar confusion when debating about \"natural\" versus \"unnatural\" methods of Human Enhancement [18, 37]. Similar to vaccination, this argument employs nature as a source of moral insight to assess the goodness of a (technological) intervention [cf. 38]. (Perceived) Invasiveness People are more reluctant to an enhancement if the method is invasive [28, 29, 31, 39, 40]. Critical to note here is that nearly all vaccination methods are invasive health interventions. Therefore, the question is less about the individual perception of vaccination as invasive[1] but the moral evaluation of this characteristic that may be re\u0000ected in evaluating other instances of Human Enhancement. Efforts to supply vaccination by injection can be tempered by fear of needles [41]. Furthermore, some arguments raised by the anti-vaccination movement build on the alleged detrimental effects of the vaccine [9], which can - logically speaking - only be exercised from within the body. As vaccination is often applied by injection, the association of literally piercing the \u0000eshly boundaries of the bodily self may negatively modulate the reluctance to this type of intervention. Hence, evaluation of invasiveness seems to be an additional source for moral and use-related evaluation. There is an apparent focus within the ethical debate of Human Enhancement on those interventions that directly cross the line between what is considered \"outside\" and \"inside\" [37]. This focus has been rightfully criticized in the past [18, 19, 42]. But Human Enhancement means like genetic engineering, \"smart drugs,\" or invasive brain-computer interfaces are often employed as prime examples of the Human Enhancement debate. They all have in common that these technologies can only exercise their desired or feared effects from within. This links them directly to other interventions commonly employed in the medical context, e.g., vaccination. On the parallels between Human Enhancement and vaccination Since both phenomena generally aim to intervene with the individual body and directly concern important aspects such as bodily autonomy, health, and the relationship to nature and technology, similar concerns regarding vaccinations and the general debate about Human Enhancement are identi\u0000able. The brief snapshot from the literature fosters the impression that some reasons to reject vaccination in general and those against SARS-CoV-2 in particular are more emphasized derivations of the general concerns against Human Enhancement. Indeed, some fear that extreme situations like pandemics open up a backdoor that may render ethically challenging interventions, like Human Enhancement, more acceptable [43]. One possible aspect of vaccine skepticism is the belief that natural immunity is superior to vaccine immunity [33]. This suggests that people are more concerned with the means than the outcome. It was argued elsewhere that reasons to reject Human Enhancement in general, and vaccinations, in particular, may reside in the same aversion to an \"unnatural\" transformation of the human body [12]. The cited evidence from the literature further suggests that effectiveness is not the sole champion of (moral) evaluation. Perceived naturalness of means and their perceived invasiveness contribute to evaluating technological interventions regarding moral acceptability and propagation, respectively, the willingness to use an intervention. These concepts revolve around the debate about vaccination as an instance of modern biotechnology. Connecting the tropes and concerns of the anti- vaccination movement with the raised concerns about Human Enhancement leads to the admittedly very stark hypothesis that: People who reject a vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 do so mainly because they see it as an unnatural and invasive technological intervention.This rejection may be generalized to vaccination behavior in general.Seen more differentiated, and considering other reasons for vaccination hesitancy, we can reformulate this hypothesis into the claim that: Reasons for rejecting vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 include a greater emphasis on the role of invasiveness and naturalness. If so, these derivations of general concerns about Human Enhancement might explain vaccination reluctance among the unvaccinated, but also possible rejection of Human Enhancement (H1)[2]. The necessity to vaccinate presupposes a certain vulnerability and individual or societal risk. This risk is neither completely subjective nor objective but results from the relationship between the individual and the socio-material environment [13]. Accordingly, Human Enhancement can in\u0000uence this relationship and may lead to a transformation of risk and its perception. A practical example may be the application of vaccination. Hence, besides the intention to enhance a speci\u0000c capability, Human Enhancement can also constitute an altered relationship toward oneself and the environment (H2). The literature discusses if a widespread application of Human Enhancement may cause irreparable damage to the relationships humans build with their peers or certain values [26, 44]. Still, the question seems not to be: but rather, which changes are desirable [13]. This societal discourse will bene\u0000t from insights into how speci\u0000c enhancements like vaccinations affect the relationship of individuals to themselves and their environment.Dowewantchanthev----rabilityandriskconstitutgrelationshipourenvironment?Page 4/27The Present Study The questions posed in this study were intended to operationalize and further explore the hypothesized relationship between the evaluation of vaccination and Human Enhancement. Even if we cannot test our hypotheses causally, this study may provide initial evidence to inspire future research. Hence, we were interested in how people not vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 evaluate different phenomena related to the discourse about Human Enhancement, naturalness, and transformative technology. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was used as an example because the respective pandemic at the time of the data collection provided a convenient opportunity to examine vaccination behavior in the context of high relevance. In a previous study [12] with N = 67 (97% vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 or willing to do so), participants were asked to rate different examples on their quali\u0000cation as an instance of Human Enhancement. To further investigate public opinion on this issue, we wanted to include a more heterogeneous sample with the number of unvaccinated participants corresponding to the proportion in Germany when the present study was conducted. We suspected that those who refused to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 despite the widespread availability of vaccines and public awareness of the pandemic in early 2022 had to be a very distinctive population. Hence, we did not only collect data on the attitude towards Human Enhancement, respectively vaccination but aimed to capture attitudes on a broader range of phenomena. This was done exploratory to possibly connect vaccination behavior to other practical controversial discourse topics that touch on the relationship between humans and nature. In addition, we were interested in whether vaccination could alter the social environment's evaluation and change psychologically relevant variables such as feelings of safety and fear of infection. Any difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants was expected to suggest an altered relationship with the environment and oneself, respectively. The present study aims to contribute to an improved understanding of the motivations driving vaccination behavior and intention. Based on identifying vaccination as an instance of Human Enhancement, these questions are related to the broader discourse on this topic and the need for further understanding of the motivations and evaluations for a wide range of enhancement types [45, 46]. [1] Many thanks to an anonymous reviewer of a previous version of this manuscript who pointed this out. [2] The more differentiated perspective of our initial claim emerged within the peer review process, in which the reviewers suggested to re\u0000ect on our study rational more deeply. In concordance, statistical models were remodeled if necessary. We re\u0000ect on the research and review process in the Additional File 1. Methods Procedure We conducted the research via an online study that was in full accordance with the ethical guidelines of the University of Bamberg. It was approved by an umbrella evaluation for psychophysical testing of the university of Bamberg ethics committee (Ethikrat der Universit\u00e4t Bamberg) on August 18, 2017. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Participants We recruited participants from various sources (University e-mail-System, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and online survey distributors). To recruit unvaccinated participants, we posted the survey link to several Facebook groups whose names and descriptions suggest a critical attitude towards disease control measures of the corona pandemic or vaccination per se. We also reached out to groups that discussed the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in general and those that discussed alternative and naturopathic medicine. N = 316 persons completed the survey. Two people were excluded because they indicated they were only checking out the survey or felt compelled to give incorrect answers. The complete dataset comprised N = 314 persons (Male = 134, Female = 172, Other = 6, NA = 2; Mean age = 34.9 [16-65] years). 256 individuals (81.5%) reported having received at least one vaccination dose against SARS-CoV-2 (Vaccinated), and n = 58 (18.5%) did not (Unvaccinated)[3]. University students and participants from online survey distributors could apply for course credit or other bene\u0000ts provided by the particular website. The survey language was German. Data sampling took place from January 1st, 2022, to January 14th, 2022. At the end of the survey, the proportion of German citizens above 18 years who had received at least one dose of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was 84.8% [47], so the proportion of vaccinated to unvaccinated persons in our sample approximated the given relations in the German population. Measures If not stated otherwise, items used a 7-point Likert scale on which the maximum represented the highest a\u0000rmation. A complete list of questions asked is provided in Additional \u0000le 1. Due to the dynamic nature of the pandemic at the time of the study, scales \u2014 especially on the effects of the vaccination \u2014 were mainly self-constructed. They were meant to re\u0000ect on the speci\u0000c discourse in their particular area of interest and the related topics. We asked, for instance, how people think about genetic engineering of humans or efforts to colonize space. There are accusations that opposition to both fuels from the same anthropocentric motifs [48], and it is discussed whether genetic enhancement for long-term space missions is ethically necessary [49]. Enhancement rating (15 items): Similar to a previous study [12], participants were introduced to the notion of Human Enhancement. In the former study, participants were given an exemplary de\u0000nition (\"Human enhancement can be de\u0000ned as the improvement of humans by technological means\" [13], while in the present study, they were only told that this term has no standard de\u0000nition but that it generally refers to technologies that help expand people's abilities.Page 5/27Table 1. Presented Means of Memory Enhancement Intervention type Coded application frequency Administration of a drug in the form of tablets* Once | Daily Injection of a drug into the arm* Once | Daily Administration of a plant-based drug* Once | Daily Brain surgery Once Implantation of an electronic device into the brain Once Completion of a cognitive training program Once Special raw food diet Frequent Daily meditation Daily Note. In the case of Brain surgery, Implantation of an electronic device, completion of a cognitive training program, and raw food diet frequency were not explicitly mentioned but coded afterward. The other interventions were presented and assessed with the respective explicitly named frequencies. * = Intervention was included in the \"Interventions with parallel frequencies\" model (Table 4)Participants were asked to rate different phenomena on whether they represented an example of Human Enhancement. The examples were self-collected based on what is discussed as an instance of Human Enhancement in the literature and under different conceptualizations. To test for a possible link between the explicit representation of vaccination as an example of Human Enhancement, this rating was later employed as a predictor for the attitude toward vaccination. Data on the other examples was collected to exploratory scan for differences between unvaccinated and vaccinated participants. Attitude (10 items): People were asked to state their attitude toward phenomena like Human Enhancement, vaccination in general, space colonization, and genetic manipulation of animals, plants, or humans. Phenomena were chosen to re\u0000ect a cross-section of practical yet ethically controversial topics. These ratings mainly aimed to explore possible differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. Attitude toward Human Enhancement was later tested as a predictor for willingness to use a hypothetical enhancement, attitude toward vaccination, and future vaccination intention. Attitude toward vaccination was later employed as the outcome to test for a possible connection with the attitudes concerning Human Enhancement and other variables. We also used attitude toward Human Enhancement as outcome to compare possible predictors in separate models. Willingness to use: Participants were introduced to the following scenario: Imagine the possibility of changing your memory to the extent that exceeds your current level by far. You would remember things much better and would no longer have to rely on shopping lists reminders on your cell phone or calendar. You would also \u0000nd it much easier to learn new things. Which of the following means would you use for this? All methods have the same effect and have no adverse side effects. They were then invited to state their willingness to use different means for their bene\u0000t and rated them on invasiveness and naturalness (later referred to as perceived invasiveness and perceived naturalness). Intervention examples were chosen to re\u0000ect a mixture of invasive and natural means to improve cognitive abilities that depending on the conceptualization [21], qualify as instances of Human Enhancement. For some examples, the necessary frequency of application was explicitly mentioned (e.g., daily injections of a drug into the arm daily or one-time injection of a drug into the arm). For interventions that were not explicitly framed with an application frequency, this was coded afterward during the data analysis based on the implicit notion of the intervention (Table 1). Measuring the willingness to use an enhancement is common when assessing attitudes toward Human Enhancement and was employed in various other studies [cf. 27, 40, 50-52]. Models employed willingness to use as outcome and, among others, perceived naturalness and perceived invasiveness as predictors. Naturalness attitude (7 items): This self-developed scale was meant to re\u0000ect on the subjective evaluation of naturalness and the relationship toward nature. The intention was not to invoke a speci\u0000c notion of naturalness but leave the interpretation of this term to the participants. Example items: \"What is natural is also good,\" \"Humans and nature have separated too much.\" Sum-score of the scale was later employed to serve as a predictor for the willingness to use cognitive enhancement methods, attitudes on vaccination, and Human Enhancement and vaccination intention. Vaccination status, intention, and COVID: People were asked for the number of vaccination doses they have received against SARS-CoV-2, how many they are planning to get in the future (absolute amount), and if they are generally concerned with keeping their vaccination status against other diseases updated.[4] Current and planned vaccinations were accessed categorically (0-3 doses) with the possibility to answer by free text. Participants also indicated whether they were con\u0000rmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Y/N) and how much they identi\u0000ed with their vaccination status. Planned doses were later used as outcome in the prediction of vaccination intention. Here, past COVID infection served as a predictor. To explore the role of vaccination status (Unvaccinated/ Vaccinated), this categorization (Table 2) was used as predictor in all our models. Effects of vaccination status (11 items): These questions asked for feelings based on the current doses the participants have already received. The scale was self-developed and was meant to re\u0000ect on the individual and social effects of the vaccination and how the relationship to the environment may have changed. Sum-score of the scale served as a predictor for vaccination intention. It was also meant to explore how the administration of an example of Human Enhancement in\u0000uenced participants' perceptions and experiences during a pandemic. Example items: \"My vaccination status gives me back possibilities,\" \"My social environment reacts negatively to my vaccination status. \" Support of disease control measures (12 items): Support of different governmental-directed disease control measures. Examples were self-collected based on what has been discussed to contain the pandemic (general vaccine mandate) or was employed in various countries, including Germany (e.g., mask mandate,Page 6/27curfews). Sum-score of the scale served as a predictor for vaccination intention. The scale was employed to clarify whether unvaccinated participants only reject the vaccination or are generally critical against any disease control measures. Improvements after the \u0000rst (possible) dose (5 items): People were asked if their feelings right after the \u0000rst vaccine dose improved or worsened compared to the time before. Participants who had not received a vaccination were instructed to refer to the time when they were theoretically able to get vaccinated. The scale was self-constructed to re\u0000ect the possible psychological change of the opportunity of getting vaccinated. Values below four indicated a worsening; four indicated no change, and ratings above indicated an improvement. Sum-score of the scale served as a predictor for vaccination intention. It was also meant to explore how the administration of an example of Human Enhancement in\u0000uenced the perception and experience of participants amid a pandemic. Any change also suggests a relational change. For instance, participants were asked to which extent their feelings of safety had changed. [3] This terminology can only be interpreted in regard to the vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. We have no information on whether people have received any other vaccination in their lifetime. [4] At the time of data sampling, people vaccinated with a single dose of Janssen\u00ae by Johnson & Johnson had the legal status of being fully vaccinated. Participants were instructed to count a \u0000rst dose of this vaccine as two and add subsequent doses by one. Results Data analysis was primarily conducted with R (4.2.2). Models were calculated using the brms package [53] (2.18). Bayesian models ran four sampling chains, 10,000 iterations, with 5,000 warm-up iterations each. When equality of variance was not present, degrees of freedom were corrected using the Welch approximation. All p-values are two-sided. If not stated otherwise, data from all 314 participants were included. Table 2. Distribution of Vaccination Status Received doses of vaccines at the time of the data sampling 0 Doses 58 Unvaccinated: 58 1 Dose 4 Vaccinated: 256 2 Doses 65 3 Doses 187 Planned number of doses 0 Doses 54 1 Dose 0 2 Doses 18 3 Doses 132 3+ Doses 20 As much as needed 74 Undecided 3 NA 13 Current and planned vaccinations. Many people used the free-text option to answer the question about the planned vaccinations, stating that they either consider getting as many vaccine doses as needed or required (as needed) or a speci\u0000c number of doses greater than three (3+). Some people were unsure (undecided) or left an incomprehensible answer (NA). Eight participants (2.55%) reported that they planned to receive fewer doses than they already had. It is possible they misread the question and stated the relative amount of planned doses, not the absolute. Their planned vaccine doses were coded NA. Table 2 shows the distribution inside the groups. Figure 1 shows the association between current and planned received doses in the absolute amount of received and planned doses. A numeric overview can be found in the additional \u0000le. Of the three undecided persons, one had received three, one two, and one zero doses. Scales. Sum-scores of the effects of the vaccination status (internal consistency, Cronbach's = .76, Con\u0000dence Interval = CI95% [0.72, 0.80]), CI95% and approval for disease control measures attitude ( = .94, CI95% [0.93, 0.95]) were calculated. Some items were reverse-coded after the check.keys method of the R psych (2.1.9.) package [54] identi\u0000ed them as negatively correlated with the \u0000rst component of principal component analysis. Additional \u0000le 1 provides an overview. Table 3 shows selected differences, and Figure 2 detailed answers to the improvements after the \u0000rst (possible) dose scale for vaccinated participants only.Page 7/27Table 3.

Max values: attitude toward items, vaccination status importance, keeping up with vaccinations, and indented items = 7; support of disease control measures = 84; naturalness attitude = 49; improvements after \u0000rst possible dose = 35; effect of vaccination status = 77. When degrees of freedom (df) are uneven, Welch approximation was conducted. Human Enhancement Ratings. Ratings of unvaccinated and vaccinated people differed in two cases. Unvaccinated participants rated Drugs to increase life expectancy (t(312) = 3.41, p < .001, d = -0.50 [-0.79,-0.21]) and neuroenhancement drugs (t(312) = 2.32, p = .021, d = -0.34 [-0.63,-0.50]) as less exemplarily for being an instance of Human Enhancement. There were no differences regarding the other phenomena (all p < .10), including vaccinations (t(312) < 1, p = .529, d = -0.09 [-0.38,0.20]). Among vaccinated participants, ratings of vaccinations as an example of Human Enhancement and feelings of being technologically enhanced correlated positively, t(254) = 5.25, p < .001, r = 0.31 [0.20,0.42] Compared to our earlier study [12], mean ratings of neuroenhancement drugs (t(379) = 2.39, cybernetic p = .031, d = 0.29 [0.03,0.57]) were lower, respectively higher than in the present study. Cybernetic prostheses (M = 5.54, sd = 1.80), Cochlear implants (M = 5.46, sd = 2.01), followed by neuroenhancement drugs (M = 4.92, sd = 1.84), were rated most exemplarily for being an enhancement among all participants. Vaccinations ranked eight of \u0000fteen (M = 3.51, sd = 2.25). A graphical overview of the enhancement ratings is provided in Additional \u0000le 1. Willingness to use, perceived naturalness, and perceived invasiveness of cognitive enhancement methods: To test for the assumed link between vaccination behavior, Human Enhancement, perceived naturalness, and perceived invasiveness of an intervention, we predicted willingness to use a cognitive enhancement intervention. Differences between the example-speci\u0000c ratings on naturalness and invasiveness were also examined along the line of vaccination status. Unvaccinated participants rated the one-time administration of a drug in the form of tablets (t(312) = 5.90, p < .001, d = 0.86 [0.56,1.15]), one-time injection of a drug into the arm (t(312) = 6.67, p < .001, d = 0.97 [0.67,1.27]), one-time administration of a plant-based drug (t(312) = 2.91, p = .004, d = 0.42 [0.13,0.71]),Page 8/27daily administration of a drug in the form of tablets (t(312) = 4.96, p < .001, d = 0.72 [0.43,1.01]) and the daily injection of a drug into the arm (t(312) = 3.85, p < .001, d = 0.55 [0.27,0.84]) higher in invasiveness than vaccinated participants. There were no signi\u0000cant differences in the other examples (all p's < .10). Concerning perceived naturalness, unvaccinated participants rated the one-time administration of a drug in the form of tablets (t(312) = -4.07, p < .001, d = -0.59 [-0.88,-0.30]), one-time injection of a drug into the arm (t(312) = -4.61, p < .001, d = -0.67 [-0.97,-0.39]), daily administration of a drug in the form of tablets (t(312) = -3.11, p = .002, d = -0.45 [-0.74,-0.16]) and the daily injection of a drug into the arm (t(312) = -2.88, p = .004, d = -0.42 [-0.70,-0.13]) as less natural than vaccinated participants. There were no signi\u0000cant differences in the other examples (all p's < .06). Ratings of willingness to use, perceived naturalness, and perceived invasiveness displayed a rating tendency to the extreme (mostly 1 or 7 - see Additional File 1). We chose a mixed-model Bayesian ordered cumulative regression to account for these bimodal, non-Gaussian distributions. Attitude toward Human Enhancement, perceived invasiveness, perceived naturalness, application frequency, vaccination status, and interactions with vaccination status, except one with application frequency, were set as population-level effects. These effects represent effects that should be consistent across examples [56]. Participant and intervention type (left column Table 1, drugs, diet, etc.) were set as group-level effects. This allows for variation around group means that may differ from the general average [56]. We did so because we were interested in the general role of the \u0000xed effects across various interventions that may differ in their mean willingness to use. Tests for interaction effects were chosen to elaborate on whether unvaccinated participants would emphasize the subjective evaluations more when contemplating using various cognitive enhancement methods. 2 x 5 models were constructed to explore possible interaction effects and account for frequency and type asymmetry. Models 1-5 (Table 4) considered all interventions, and Models 6-10 only included interventions whose required application frequency was assessed symmetrically (i.e., once as daily and once as a one-time intervention). Figure 3 visualizes model 10. Attitude toward Vaccination. We predicted the attitude toward vaccinations using linear Bayesian regression to clarify the role of perceiving vaccinations as Human Enhancement. Estimates are shown in Table 5 and represent \u0000ve different models, all using different interaction terms. The reason for employing several models was to explore the role of the different variables as well as approximate the variable combination that provided the best \u0000t. Model 5 is visualized in Figure 4. Table 5. Estimating Attitude toward Vaccinations Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Predictors distribution of the calculated bayesian linear regression.

We were interested if the variables that reliably predicted attitude toward vaccination share this function when predicting attitude toward vaccination. We constructed several models with various interactions. Attitude toward Human Enhancement was chosen as outcome. After visually inspecting the correlations between the coe\u0000cient distributions, we observed that predictor weights of attitude on vaccination andPage 9/27vaccination status were highly correlated. To reduce the in\u0000uence of multicollinearity, we dropped attitude on vaccination as a predictor and calculated the models presented here. Table 6.

We noticed the model-dependent change of effect direction of rating vaccinations as an example of Human Enhancement and its interaction with vaccination status, e.g., when modeled with the interaction between naturalness attitude and vaccination status. Hence, we explored a three-way interaction between these variables (Table 6 - Model 5). For better comparison with Figure 4 and as it has a slighter better model \u0000t, we visualize the coe\u0000cients from Model 4 in Figure 5. Still, including the three-way interaction suggests that the interaction effect between vaccination status and enhancement rating of vaccinations only increases the attitude toward Human Enhancement for the vaccinated participants. Predicting vaccination intention. After testing for the assumed link between vaccination behavior Human Enhancement and perceived naturalness/invasiveness, we were interested in what drives vaccination intention, especially for already vaccinated and boostered participants. This interest emerged during the data analysis after recognizing that many people stated that they wanted to receive more than three doses (Figure 1, Table 7 Table 7. Planned and Current Doses Current Number of Vaccine Doses 0 Doses (n=58) 1 Dose (n=4) 2 Doses (n=65) 3 Doses (n=187) Overall (n=314) More doses? No (Equal) (93.1%) 0 15 88 157 (0%) 4 (6.2%) 10 (5.3%) 16 (5.1%) Note. People undecided about future vaccination status were coded as NA. 36.9% (69/187) of the boostered people reported getting as many doses as medically advised or needed. This are 77.5% (69/89) of all boostered participants that want to receive more doses. Out of the n = 65 with two doses, only n = 4 (6.2%) reported wanting more than three doses. We used Bayesian logistic regression to predict whether individuals plan to receive more vaccine doses, regardless of the exact intended amount, and excluded all participants whose intention was either not comprehensible or indecisive (NA in Table 7). Results are shown in Table 8 and Figure 6. Page 10/27 Table 8.

As the decision to get no more doses is not equivalent to the decision to not get vaccinated at all, additional Bayesian ordinal regressions were calculated, considering only participants who already received two or three doses, respectively. We separated the data as the number of received doses cannot logically predict each outcome (Boostered participants cannot plan to get only two doses). We did not predict the exact number of doses for unvaccinated participants because only 2/58 (5.2%) planned to get vaccinated (100%;2/2 = planned to get two doses), resulting in too little data. All four participants that received one dose stated that they wanted to receive more doses (25%;1/4 = 2 Doses, 50%;2/4 = 3 Doses, 25%;1/4 = As needed), but the sample size was again too small; consequently, we did not include the data into our models.

Our data revealed that both phenomena seem linked to a special and individual emphasis on the relevance of perceived naturalness and perceived invasiveness. We also found a link to the perceived human relationship to nature. Although our study design does not allow causal inferences, our \u0000ndings provide evidence for the hypothesis that these links may culminate in vaccination behavior or, more speci\u0000cally, the rejection of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. A summary of our \u0000ndings can be found in Table 10. At the end of the data collection (January 14th, 2022), nearly 85% of German adults had received at least one dose of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 [47], so about 15% of this population was still unvaccinated. More than one year after the start of the vaccination campaign in most Western countries (e.g., Germany started on December 27th, 2020 [57]), most of these countries are still faced with a large number of unvaccinated people (e.g., Austria ~23%, Hungary ~35%. Italy ~14%, USA ~19%[1, 57][5]). Reasons for vaccine hesitancy before or at the start of the vaccination campaign might have been based on safety and e\u0000cacy concerns [58, 59]. These concerns prevail under a longitudinal perspective after a vaccination campaign has started [60] and are a general facet of anti-vaccination attitudes [9, 33]. In addition to these concerns, additional motifs to reject any vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 may reside in the fundamental objection against any invasive technological intervention deemed unnatural. Our sample is clearly divided by the attribute of being vaccinated against SARS- CoV-2. Vaccinated and unvaccinated people differ in nearly all parameters that we have tested. Most importantly, unvaccinated people showed a more a\u0000rmative attitude towards naturalness and reported attitudes favoring phenomena commonly associated with alternative medicine and disfavoring those that imply human interference with nature of various kinds. Among the many different conceptualizations of Human Enhancement, functional approaches to this phenomenon emphasize how technologies can improve an existing capability of the human body [21]. Under this and other notions, vaccination is an instance of Human Enhancement. The widespread application of Human Enhancement in terms of the speci\u0000c vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 provides an excellent opportunity to study reservations against vaccination as such in the context of the ongoing ethical debate about Human Enhancement. However, it is crucial to carve out the divergence between the public perception of vaccinations as Human Enhancement and the academic discussion of this phenomenon. As in another study [12], those phenomena that, at \u0000rst glance, represent a combination of invasiveness and some kind of technological device (cybernetic prostheses and cochlear implants) were considered to be the best example of Human Enhancement (Additional File 1). Vaccination was not seen in such an exemplary way. There were no differences in these ratings across vaccination status groups. Interestingly, enhancement ratings of unvaccinated participants differed in two cases that are extensively covered by the literature as prime examples of Human Enhancement: Drugs to increase life expectancy and drugs to enhance cognitive functioning. These enhancements were rated as less exemplary. These interventions are considered crucial for the \"Enhancement Project\" and the desire to radically emancipate from the human condition [15-17]. While there are reasons to reject radically enhanced cognitive functions based on a \"conservative bias\" that values the status quo more than a promised, more valuable future condition, radical life expectancy enhancement cannot be rejected on the same ground [44]. Further research should investigate which conceptualization of Human Enhancement is publically predominant. Our \u0000ndings substantiate the impression that Human Enhancement is publically understood and de\u0000ned in terms of invasiveness and the material presence of the technology in question. Factors that also in\u0000uence the evaluation of such technologies [29, 39, 40]. This only concerns the classi\u0000cation and says little to nothing about moral or use-related evaluation. People are less likely to use means to enhance cognitive functions when considered invasive, even when told that no adverse side effects are expected. Perceived naturalness, higher attitude toward Human Enhancement, more a\u0000rmative naturalness attitude, and low application frequency also reliably predicted willingness to use means of cognitive enhancement across several models. The role of perceived naturalness and perceived invasiveness is concurrent with other studies [28, 29, 31, 39, 40][6]. Among individuals not vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, perceived naturalness was reliably more in\u0000uential than among vaccinated participants. Our statistical models also yielded evidence for interaction effects between naturalness attitude, perceived invasiveness, and vaccination status. Credible intervals of coe\u0000cient estimates of vaccination status and the interaction term with perceived invasiveness and naturalness attitude included zero, depending on the model. Still, at least our visual inspection of model predictions gave the impression that vaccination status increased the negative association effect of naturalness attitude and perceived invasiveness on willingness to use. When evaluated in a speci\u0000c context with additional background information, perceived naturalness of the intervention seems to have more impact than the more general attitude toward naturalness, which is not task-wise directly linked to the outcome. The interaction effect of vaccination status and perceived invasiveness was reliably present when including all interventions in the model. In contrast, the effect was more uncertain in the models that included only a subpart of interventions. The former models also included interventions like the implantation of electronic devices and brain surgery deemed highly invasive. However, the latter models kept including interventions rated as more invasive and less natural by unvaccinated participants. Including interaction terms only slightly improved models' \u0000t and predictive power. Still note, how under the introduction of interaction terms, the predictive power of vaccination status on willingness to use a means for cognitive improvement disappeared. Modeling these terms allows for a more differentiated perspective on the group-related evaluation of the interventions. The \u0000ts of the different models suggest that it is not the vaccination status per se that matters but rather the group-dependent accentuated valuation of intervention properties. This fosters the notion that unvaccinated participants put particular emphasis on the relevance of perceived naturalness and invasiveness. Crucially, perception of these properties is, taken alone, already critical for deciding whether to adopt a method for cognitive enhancement. Compare this to the belief that natural immunity is superior to vaccine-induced [33]. A common notion for vaccine skeptics and examined in isolation, this belief does question the necessity of gaining protection against a disease, but only the means to achieve them. Critically, unvaccinated participants differed in their ratings of naturalness and invasiveness in several examples. Compared to vaccinated participants, they rated daily and one-time administrations of drugs as tablets or injections consistently as more invasive and less natural. Taken together, these \u0000ndings suggest a different perception and emphasis on these variables, which consistently predict the general willingness to use different methods for cognitive enhancements in general. Page 14/27 Note, however, that the general willingness to use the interventions appeared to be relatively low, especially for the unvaccinated participants (Additional File 1). Effects at the group level showed a considerable variation across intervention types and participants. Visual inspection of model effects revealed that, at foremost, the probability of completely rejecting the interventions was most in\u0000uenced by the predictors. Interactions with vaccination status evidently in\u0000uenced the probabilities of the different willingness to use ratings, especially the rating of the lowest possible number (1). Probabilities rating the willingness to use with the highest possible number (7) were relatively low and less in\u0000uenced. Moreover, credible intervals of the ratings often overlap, so a clear distinction between the ratings is challenging. This suggests that our models may be able to predict any change from the lowest a\u0000rmation to slightly higher ratings but that predictions at the upper scale are not well captured. This slightly differed across predictors but may result from a general reluctance to use cognitive enhancement means, which was also observed elsewhere [40, 50]. Reasons for that may stem from a general moderate to negative attitude toward various phenomena related to Human Enhancement [46]. Unlike other studies [e.g., 31, 61, 62], we evaluated if participants would use the enhancement on themselves and not a third party. There is evidence that people are reluctant to use enhancement for themselves while being more permissive to the use by others [28]. Suppose vaccine skepticism re\u0000ects strong core beliefs about the association between agency, nature, spirituality, and individual health [63]; our \u0000ndings reasonably suggest a close kinship between these motives and the aversion to Human Enhancement. (Perceived) Naturalness plays a role in accepting means for Human Enhancement [28-30]. Vaccination behavior and intention are hindered by concerns about naturalness and the belief that natural immunity is superior to vaccinations [32-35]. Hence, naturalness seems to have a different salience for unvaccinated people. If something natural is automatically \"good,\" it seems likely that something unnatural is considered \"worse,\" i.e., cannot bene\u0000t oneself. Thus, it is questionable if unvaccinated participants understand Human Enhancement as an improvement in the \u0000rst place. Just as they may see vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 as a risky, unnatural, and consequently unbearable intervention, adverse side effects of other instances of Human Enhancement may weigh out their promised bene\u0000ts. This may have fostered a negative attitude toward this phenomenon. Albeit we did not introduce the term framed as \"improvement,\" low ratings and the not evident differences in classifying vaccinations as Human Enhancement may be due to several reasons. People may apply a different de\u0000nition of technology or question if prevention is an enhancement [22]. Participants, especially those skeptical of technological interventions, may additionally question if the intervention can live up to its improving purpose, implied by the denomination as Human Enhancement. This somewhat resembles one core problem of the general debate. The eponymous enhancement is often framed as an improvement. But on a more philosophical level, critics of Human Enhancement fear back\u0000ring and disastrous side effects such as alienation from our not enhanced peers and the world, losing what makes us human, or sealing the end of our species [16, 24, 37, 64, 65]. Although being a functionally effective improvement, subjective evaluation of enhancement effects may diverge. In addition, (long-term) side effects in various areas can quickly render any enhancement ethically controversial and undermine the meaning of the overarching concept. Given the nonexisting difference in enhancement ratings for unvaccinated and vaccinated participants across several examples, further research should investigate group differences in rationalization and identi\u0000cation. The data shows that a\u0000rmative attitudes toward naturalness negatively in\u0000uenced the attitude toward vaccination for both unvaccinated and vaccinated participants, although it was more in\u0000uential for unvaccinated participants. In addition, attitudes toward Human Enhancement increased only the attitudes toward vaccination for the unvaccinated group (Figure 5, upper right panel). This \u0000nding shows that unvaccinated participants tend to be more favorable to a speci\u0000c biotechnological intervention when they are generally open to the improvement of human capabilities. Yet, important to note that these beliefs seem not strong enough to convince people to get vaccinated. Across models, attitudes toward Human Enhancement were driven by vaccination status and naturalness attitude. Explained variance was consistently higher for attitude toward vaccination. Probably due to the implementation of vaccination status. Additional support for our hypotheses of the more pronounced emphasis on the relevance of naturalness as an alleged link between the rejection of vaccinations and Human Enhancement is provided by the \u0000nding that an interaction term between naturalness attitude and vaccination status very likely contributed to a less positive attitude toward Human Enhancement. This association was not as certain as in predicting attitude toward vaccination. The somewhat unreliable predictive power ratings of vaccination, as an example for Human Enhancement on attitude toward vaccination and Human Enhancement, could be cautiously interpreted as additional evidence for the evaluative link between the phenomenon. However, not only did the credible intervals of the effect estimation sometimes include 0, but the direction of interaction effects also changed across models and outcomes. When interpreted more conservatively and considering the correlative nature of our study, we suspect that contemplating vaccination as an instance of Human Enhancement given a particular attitude toward vaccination and providing an obvious, ready-to-hand example directly intertwines the two assessments. Caution is advised. Although Human Enhancement is manifold, the same ready-to-hand process could have in\u0000uenced the relationship between attitudes toward Human Enhancement and vaccination. A\u0000rmation or rejection of the two phenomena must not necessarily stem from the explicit individual labeling and conceptualization of vaccination as an instance of Human Enhancement. The term is an umbrella term that struggles to \u0000nd a focus for discussion in the charged utopian or dystopian debate. [21, 66]. One can reject vaccination without even knowing about Human Enhancement. At the same time, somebody else can be a\u0000rmative to the prospect of future cognitive enhancement drugs without acknowledging that vaccination is Human Enhancement. Shared motifs seem to be associated with evaluating the species (vaccination) and its genus (Human Enhancement), which do not require explicit linkage and academic classi\u0000cation. This is consistent with the observation that one general factor can explain over half of the variance in the personal willingness to use various and differing Human Enhancement associated means [27]. Perceived naturalness and perceived invasiveness seem to be good starting points for further evaluation of the characteristics of such factor. However, as the prediction of willingness to use suggest, the more speci\u0000c the features of the intervention in question, the less important general concerns about naturalness. Essentially, interventions not commonly associated with \"unnaturalness\" may boost human performance and qualify as Human Enhancement under a speci\u0000c de\u0000nition [12, 21, 67]. Examples are instrumental music training [68], Tai Chi in combination with cognitive interventions [69], and even drinking waterPage 15/27[70]. These means may be seen as \"conventional,\" \"natural,\" or \"historical\" and less problematic [18, 37, 71]. General di\u0000culties with this prescription are discussed elsewhere [12, 19, 42]. Still, Franke et al. [72] reported that participants expressed ambiguous opinions about the moral equivalence of caffeine and neuroenhancement drugs. But as our data shows, personal attitudes on naturalness can in\u0000uence the adaptation of technologies even when, as in the case of vaccinations, they have been conventionally used for about 300 years. This may also be due to the conceptual confusion around the term \"natural\" [36]. Vaccinated participants reported feeling more technologically enhanced. Unvaccinated participants are unlikely to a\u0000rm this statement, as it indirectly refers to being vaccinated. However, one must note the low a\u0000rmation of this statement among vaccinated individuals and the possibility of a confoundation due to asking whether participants consider vaccinations as Human Enhancement. Ratings of vaccinations as examples of Human Enhancement and feelings of being technologically enhanced correlated moderately positively among vaccinated participants. Vaccinations are not only an objective protection against a deadly virus but also seem to subtly modulate some aspects of the relationship toward oneself and the environment. Vaccinated over unvaccinated participants reported a signi\u0000cant improvement after the \u0000rst dose of the vaccine and more positive effects due to their vaccination status. The former \u0000nding suggests that receiving vaccination has a psychological effect. However, this data must again be interpreted cautiously. Although we had asked unvaccinated participants to compare their current condition with the point when they could theoretically receive the vaccine, it is di\u0000cult to assess purely hypothetical effects retroactively. Hence, one should interpret these \u0000ndings rather in the context of the self- assessed change within the vaccinated participants. The results suggest that the environment the vaccinated participants adapted to was perceived differently. This comprised fewer feelings of exclusion and stress (Additional File 1) and improved feelings of safety, and less fear of infections. Interestingly, vaccinated people, although better protected against the disease [73, 74], reported no differing feelings of vulnerability compared to unvaccinated people. In addition, unvaccinated participants reported being more relaxed. Two effects seem to work here: Most obviously, unvaccinated people seem not to view SARS-CoV-2 as dangerous. A general carelessness about the disease also explains why there are no differences between unvaccinated and vaccinated participants when asked if the disease appears less dangerous to them: If it is considered harmless, the perceived danger is hard to decrease. In addition, reports of decreasing immune protection combined with the back-then dominance of virus variant B.1.1.529 (\"Omicron\") in Germany may have fostered increased concerns among vaccinated people. Logically, those most concerned about their safety engage in the most protective behavior and higher adherence to health measures [75]. However, it is unclear if the risk perception is phenomenologically speaking comparable. Human Enhancement technologies transform the perception of risk [13]. There may be profound disagreement between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants about the initial dimensions of risk posed by the virus. Our data suggest that receiving a vaccination does not render the virus perception-wise harmless but that the effect is more subtle. A decrease is not an elimination but must \u0000rst be understood relative to a baseline, which may fundamentally differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. Our data also shine light on the social components of Human Enhancement technologies. Disease containment measures to the disadvantage of unvaccinated people may have contributed to feeling left out and adverse reactions from peers. In that case, the enhancement (vaccine) modulates the relation to the social environment and perception. Possible social in\u0000uence, coercion, and division are prevalent topics in the Human Enhancement debate [19, 37, 50, 52, 76-78]. Any so-experienced coercion to enhance, regardless of origin, can directly interfere with the subjective notion of autonomy and bodily integrity. The sometimes violent and aggressive civic protest of opponents of disease control measures and vaccination can be interpreted as the counter- reaction to an augmented (vaccinated) social and political environment to which the unvaccinated do not want to adapt with the help of Human Enhancement. If there is a su\u0000cient supply of vaccines, every citizen is faced with whether or not to be vaccinated. This collective interpellation may result in polarization about the decision to get vaccinated and the general pandemic discourse [79]. Opinions may have become so strong that future change becomes unlikely. Indeed, most unvaccinated people are not planning to get a vaccination in the future. Besides concerns about safety and e\u0000cacy, there are political and naturalness-related dimensions of vaccine hesitancy and risk perception of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [34, 80, 81] that may emerge again in the future, possibly even more deadly epidemics. Therefore, vaccine hesitancy should not be seen as a purely individual matter but embedded in the socio- technological context comprising individual and societal relationships to nature, technology, and risk [13]. Depending on the model's complexity, odds ratio of wanting more doses when being vaccinated three times compared to zero doses was < 1. Visual inspection of a model that included all but those participants who have only received one dose suggests the universal effect of attitude toward vaccinations and the support of disease control measures for vaccine intention. Group-related differences merely in\u0000uenced the certainty about the effect. Even if effects vary in uncertainty, strength, and alleged direction across participant groups: If examined in a broad context of different variables and interactions, having received three doses alone is insu\u0000cient to conclude that these people will further engage in speci\u0000c vaccination behavior. More important than the mere number are the underlying attitudes. However, models for the already boostered participants explained less variance than the one for participants with two doses. It is important to note two transition steps when predicting future vaccination doses. First is the decision to get vaccinated at all. The evident differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants suggest that this is related to attitudes toward vaccination and the basic notion of what technological changes are considered acceptable and necessary. This conclusion is supported by the negative in\u0000uence of naturalness attitude on the intention to get more doses if unvaccinated participants were evaluated alone. Hence, the decision to engage with technological interventions seems to be fundamentally linked to the perceived relationship of humans to nature. Once vaccinated, the second transition is the decision to get more vaccine doses, or more speci\u0000cally, to plan to get as many doses as medically required or needed. Here, the effect of the individual sets of beliefs and attitudes on naturalness-related questions may not disappear but decrease in importance and gain uncertainty. Attitudes do not simply change because one gets vaccinated for whatever reasons, but they play an essential role in preparing or hindering vaccination behavior or intention. Wanting more vaccination among the vaccinated participants depends mostly on the attitude toward vaccination and the support of disease control measures. But vaccination intention seems less present for people who have already been \"boostered,\" i.e., received three doses. Page 16/27 When assessing and predicting the exact number of planned vaccinations, it became evident that people with two doses seemed to plan until getting boostered. Only 6.2% of these participants stated that to receive more than three doses. If willing to receive more doses, boostered participants plan even further. This cannot be explained by the fact that \"more\" for boostered patients is always more than three doses. 77.5% of these participants stated they would receive as many doses as needed without submitting themselves to a speci\u0000c number. Once again, the support of disease control measures and the attitude toward vaccinations mattered the most here, while naturalness attitude had no predictive power. In addition, the positive aspect based on their vaccination status mattered only for people having received two doses. Visual inspection of the model also suggested a discernible but uncertain effect of attitude toward Human Enhancement for the intention to get three, respectively, as many doses as needed for participants with two doses. It is generally unclear whether the vaccinated persons are apodictic on the exact number of planned doses. Yet, it seems like there are psychological thresholds, ranging from dose to dose, that must be traversed when planning further ahead. Some evidence questioning the strength of intention is provided when considering that data sampling occurred in January 2022. As effective of January 2023, ~18 percent of the German population above 18 years have received more than three vaccine doses [2]. If we compare that number to the 29.9% (94 / 314) of the entire sample, respectively 36.7% (94 / 256)[7] of the vaccinated participants, who stated that they either plan to receive more than three or as many doses as medically necessary, we cannot deny the impression of observing a gap between intention and actual behavior. However, this should be interpreted with great caution, as we do not know how many of our participants put their plans for further vaccinations into action. Still, when predicting vaccination intention, the effect of attitudes toward vaccination and the support of disease control measures suggest two primary motivations here. First, one attitude toward vaccination may be related to acknowledging the critical effect of this technology in \u0000ghting the pandemic. Our data cannot determine whether participants held this belief a priori or formed it post hoc. Secondly, the support of disease control measures should not be interpreted as an end in itself but rather a re\u0000ection of the perceived danger of the virus. Besides questioning the general necessity, there are other reasons not to support measures like school closings and immunity passports. Still, if someone deems the virus not dangerous, they are less likely to support any countermeasures or get vaccinated [34, 58, 81, 82]. Another possibility may be that vaccinated people want to receive more doses not primarily because they are convinced of their individual and public health bene\u0000ts but because of the restrictions imposed on unvaccinated and not boostered persons. Since three doses were often su\u0000cient to circumvent other measures to prevent infection, such as mandatory testing, this would explain why vaccination uptake beyond three doses is still relatively low in Germany. Another reason lies in the fact that the German Health authorities have not explicitly a\u0000rmed the medical necessity for more than three doses unless for people with a certain age, medical history, or occupation [83]. Either way, getting boostered or vaccinated in the \u0000rst place can be understood as adapting oneself to a hazardous or socially restrictive environment through technology, i.e., a form of Human Enhancement. Attitudes, intentions, and behavior should be studied in acknowledgment of the complex embedding of these parameters and their dynamic interaction. Importantly, social institutions and processes can convey the need to enhance in the same manner as the \"natural\" environment. [5] Due to calculation method, percentages include people under the age of 18. Effective date: January, 18th, 2023. [6] Scheske and Schall [29] reported mixed results on naturalness. [7] No unvaccinated participant reported to want more than 2 doses Limitations And Directions For Future Research There are several limitations to our present study. The unvaccinated participants in our study were targeted by also using Facebook groups deemed critical to disease control measures. It is unclear if the members of the respective groups are representative of other unvaccinated participants, but also how many were redirected from the Facebook groups. However, ubiquitous advertisement to receive the vaccination paired with a discourse that put heavy pressure on everybody to get vaccinated and the fact that 85% of the German population above 18 years decided to receive a vaccination suggests that the remaining ~15% unvaccinated persons are more likely to represent a speci\u0000c ideological hard kernel. Not necessarily in terms of taking political action or engaging in public discourse like the organized anti-vaccination movement, but by sharing similar beliefs about the pandemic, the vaccine, and disease control measures. In the face of a public discourse that was very critical toward anyone refusing to get vaccinated and the state-ordered disease contagion measures, pre- pandemic ideological convictions could have been further ampli\u0000ed. We should also not forget that some disease control measures were de jure and ipso facto discriminatory to unvaccinated people. Due to the characteristics of a global pandemic, (not) receiving the vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was an individual but also highly political act that, at the time of the data sampling, cannot be reduced to logistical problems but must be seen in the context of the political dimension of the pandemic and the general anti-vaccination discourse. Still, the generalizability of our \u0000ndings to vaccine hesitancy in general, particularly at the beginning of a vaccination campaign against another disease, is limited. Comparison between unvaccinated persons who are and are not engaged in the public anti-vaccination movement remains an interesting topic for future research. Only four participants reported having received only one dose. More data is needed to research the transition between one and two or zero and one doses. While naturalness attitude, among other variables, seemed to matter, we did not ask participants why they were not vaccinated. Therefore, the direction of the effects shown here remains unclear. We do not know if the attitude toward vaccination was already low before the pandemic or if the ubiquitous discussion of this issue has polarized vaccinated and unvaccinated. Overall, the evidence for our hypotheses is weakened by correlative and cross-sectional operationalization by the very nature of the design of our study. Nevertheless, we consider our \u0000ndings an important \u0000rst step in linking vaccination behavior and Human Enhancement to related variables, but further studies are needed to disentangle correlation and causation. The survey language we used was German. That could have introduced a cultural bias to our \u0000ndings, especially when assessing the attitude toward phenomena like anthroposophy and alternate healing practitioners that has a speci\u0000c and in\u0000uential tradition in Germany (Additional File 1). Further studies should engage also employ cross-cultural samples. Page 17/27Due to the timely nature of this research, the items we employed were not part of a preexisting psychometric instrument and should be further tested for their validity. This especially concerns measurements of naturalness attitude. Items directly referring to the vaccination's effect are of limited use when answered by unvaccinated participants. Future studies should make sure to attune item formulation to unvaccinated participants better. Comparing the exact number of vaccinations is challenging due to differing regularities of required doses for licensed immunity. In addition, some participants may not be vaccinated due to medical reasons or have just recovered from the disease. When assessing the willingness to use a method for cognitive enhancement, interventions should be balanced and varied to a greater extent in future studies. This is re\u0000ected in the variation at the group level of intervention type. Differences between self-use and administration to third parties should be further explored. More comprehensive data should be collected to evaluate the generally low willingness to use. Additional attention should be directed to the implicit notions of the interventions. A scenario in which side effects of the administration of plant-based drugs are communicated to have the same potential side effects as brain surgery certainly demands improvement. This study, like many others, only assessed willingness to use methods for cognitive enhancement, which is just one subfraction of Human Enhancement. It also employed a \u0000ctional scenario. Linking our \u0000ndings to factual engagement with cognitive enhancement or other enhancement types seems promising. We interpret our data as support for the hypothesis that some people also reject vaccination due to an increased emphasis on their understanding of naturalness and invasiveness. However, our evidence for the important role of naturalness in all sorts is richer than for the role of invasiveness. In this context, we must acknowledge that vaccinations are per se invasive in their function as medical interventions that must be administered to the immune system. This fact cannot simply be neglected. Future research should examine to which amount this invasiveness is perceived and how this transpires to vaccination behavior and intention. This may be done by experimentally manipulating the administration method in hypothetical scenarios or comparing historical vaccine uptake data concerning the administration method (nasal vs. injection vs. oral). To specify the possible hierarchy of speci\u0000c naturalness concerns over general ones, studies should also examine if there is any difference in the perception depending on the vaccination mechanism (mRNA, vector, etc.). Nevertheless, vaccination behavior is a problem that is di\u0000cult to study in a laboratory and experimental context. Quantitative measures should be enriched by qualitative accounts that elaborate more deeply on the individual motifs and conceptual understandings[cf. 84]. In these studies, participants should actively be questioned about their direct reasons for their vaccination behavior. While perceived naturalness is already lively discussed by the literature, perceived invasiveness and overarching attitudes on the relationship between humans, nature, and technology should also be included as variables of interest. Note that these variables may function more subtly and are not easily captured in daily, more general conversations. Thus, they may not be the focus of persuasive communication, e.g., for adherence to public health measures. They also seem not exclusively linked to vaccinations but also seem to manifest when discussing other phenomena like Human Enhancement in general. We, therefore, suggest explicitly considering the character of vaccination as sophisticated biotechnology when researching public attitudes toward them. This applies to all sorts of potentially disruptive technologies. It is crucial to locate them in the broader context and draw on the rich body of theoretical literature to structure and enhance the public and scienti\u0000c discourse, Conclusions As deadly viruses like SARS-CoV-2 continue to exist and will develop in the future, humanity's environment poses threats we are not fully adapted to. Altering the environment can be a solution, but as seen with climate change, this strategy can also increase the probability of new zoonotic diseases, aggravate already existing pathogens [85, 86], and lead to other disastrous outcomes. Rather than relying solely on external disease control measures, people have been adapting to potentially dangerous environments through vaccination for about three centuries. This adaptive enhancement strategy\u2014 carried out at an unprecedented speed and with novel technology \u2014 triggers concerns about the relationship between humans and nature. There are still differences between the general Human Enhancement debate and the discourse about vaccination. It is critical to understand that the latter is a subsection of the former and that the former concept is a term to discuss and explore a wide range of phenomena that bear the potential to question the relationship between humans, technology, and nature. A\u0000rmative and negative attitudes largely build on the perspective of the technologically aided alteration of human capacities. In this sense, the discourse revolving around vaccination and the expressed hopes and concerns mirror the foundation of the concept of Human Enhancement: It is considered possible to signi\u0000cantly in\u0000uence the condition of an individual and eventually an entire species through the use of (bio)technology. The varying factor is just if one considers this a good thing. This is not to say that all fears and arguments against such interventions are irrational or unsustainable. There are real risks associated with vaccination and Human Enhancement. The parallels between the general Human Enhancement debate and the speci\u0000c reluctance to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 reveal how concerns and hopes regarding the transformative power of modern biotechnologies are widely acknowledged and manifest in a practical discourse in the face of a global threat. However, any discussion can quickly heat up and may lead to a mixture of passionate, utopian, or dystopian, yet individual accounts and opinions that are taken for granted. Here, we should exercise our critical thinking by trying to identify misleading arguments that mainly build on emotion and non-transparent lines of arguments instead of submitting themselves to systematic scrutiny [9]. This means not neglecting subjective emotional distress but providing a systematic and comprehensible perspective that may function as a potential corrective. The results presented here shine new light on these discourses and explicitly link them to the subjective evaluation concepts of invasiveness and naturalness. We have revealed aspects we consider essential for future vaccination campaigns and other efforts to mass distribute Human Enhancement. Whether we should pursue these efforts demands a case-by-case evaluation. The COVID-19 pandemic may have been an excellent opportunity to examine a practical example of Human Enhancement globally, but it also brought forward various motifs, concerns, and hopes that demand a careful and honest discourse.
