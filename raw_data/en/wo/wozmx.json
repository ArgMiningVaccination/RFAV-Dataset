With its beautiful downtown, great bluff-top restaurants, art museums, and sports venues, Pittsburgh will be a great setting for our meeting. I hope to take in a Pirates game myself and reminisce about Roberto Clemente, Willie Stargell, and Manny Sanguill\u00e9n\u2014the great Pirates of my boyhood. The magnicent David L. Lawrence Convention Center will provide spectacular space and cutting-edge technology for our meeting. And we can feel good about meeting there because the Lawrence Center is a LEEDS-certied \"green\" convention center\u2014the rst in the world, in fact. Its graceful roof and terrace gardens serve more than an aesthetic function. The \"living roof\" combats urban heat effects, and the gardens supply the heirloom vegetables and herbs served there. The center's well-designed layout will enable you to move from one session to another without missing a slide. This monument to scientic and technical innovation is a particularly tting venue for the AAI meeting, where our own eld's innovators will discuss the many current breakthroughs and advances underway. It's a great time to be an immunologist. Cancer immunotherapy was picked by Science magazine as \"Breakthrough of the Year 2013,\" and innate immunity research is exploding. And, as the most comprehensive and affordable immunology meeting in the world, IMMUNOLOGY 2014 will be THE place to keep abreast of current developments in our exciting eld. It will offer Major Symposia, Distinguished Lectures and Awards Lectures, Guest Society Symposia, NIH Institute-sponsored Symposia, 74 Block Symposia, and more than 1,700 poster presentations. Of course, I am especially excited about the President's Symposium, which I had the privilege of organizing this year: The Anatomy of the Immune Response. An all-star line-up, including Ron Germain, Michel Nussenzweig, Ellen Robey, and Jason Cyster, will take us on the immunologists' \"Fantastic Voyage.\" This special event will be dedicated to the memory of our friend and colleague Leo Lefran\u00e7ois, a leader in this eld, whom we lost in 2013. And, thanks to our corporate sponsors, we have many exciting social events in store for you to meet and greet your colleagues from far and near. IMMUNOLOGY 2014 will be the culmination of the hard work of the AAI Council, Program Committee, and AAI staff. Their efforts have set us up for a scientically exciting and professionally rewarding meeting. So, like the Ohio, Monongahela, and Allegheny Rivers, let's converge on Pittsburgh and celebrate our eld. See you in Pittsburgh! Marc K.

The testimony became part of the hearing record for the committee's January 14, 2014, hearing entitled, \"Examining Conference and Travel Spending Across the Federal Government.\" Over the last several years, policy changes within the federal government have limited the ability of federal employees to attend meetings and conferences. In May 2012, the White House Ofce of Management and Budget issued a memorandum, which, among other things, required agencies to reduce their travel budgets by 30 percent (from the scal year 2010 level) and to maintain this reduced level of spending through scal year 2016. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), of which the National Institutes of Health is part, responded by giving additional scrutiny to travel requests and implementing a more arduous approval process for travel to meetings where the total expense to HHS is more than $75,000. Congress also acted, requiring agencies to submit annual reports on all government-run conferences that cost the federal government more than $100,000. Legislation pending in Congress seeks to impose further restrictions on federal employee travel. While AAI understands, as stated in its testimony, that these policy changes \"were promulgated in an effort to prevent excessive or unnecessary government spending and to prevent abuses,\" AAI believes that they \"have had an unintended and deleterious effect\" on scientists and the scientic enterprise and \"have made government scientists feel cut off from the rest of the scientic community, wreaked havoc with their ability to fulll professional commitments, and undermined the morale of some of the government's nest minds.\" To read the full AAI testimony, please visit http://aai.org/Public_Affairs/ index.html.The American Association Council President Marc K.

This alliance, formally known as the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP), is slated to be a ve-year collaboration with a total cost of about $230 million. A little more than one-half of that funding will come from NIH. AMP will focus initially on three disease areas: Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, and autoimmune disorders (specically, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus). According to the NIH news release announcing the partnership, \"[t]hree- to ve-year, milestone-driven pilot projects in these disease areas could set the stage for broadening AMP to other diseases and conditions\" (http://www.nih.gov/news/health/feb2014/od-04.htm). AMP participants have agreed to share expertise, data, and resources (including blood and tissue samples). Participants may not use any of the discoveries for their own drug research until all of the project data have been made publicly available. AAI understands that there will be new requests for applications issued for the type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus projects. ScienceInsider has reported that \"three-disease specic NIH institutes will fund the projects\" and that \"[l]ater this year, the institutes will release requests for proposals to seek academic partners. The investigators who win the grants will then become part of joint disease steering committees\" (http://news.sciencemag.org/funding/2014/02/nih-10-drug-companies-partner-study-four-diseases).

Unanue Honored with AAI Lifetime Achievement Award Emil R. Unanue, M.D., Washington University School of Medicine, is the recipient of the 2014 AAI Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of a career of extraordinary scientic achievement coupled with exceptional leadership and service to AAI. This award is the highest honor bestowed by the AAI Council upon an AAI member. Dr. Unanue has pioneered fundamental advances in the eld of antigen processing and presentation, elucidating the biochemical basis of T cell recognition of antigen. His work was the rst to controvert dogma that macrophages served only to destroy dead cells and pathogens, showing that these cells can actually present antigen to T cells. Unanue also made strides in the eld to show that proteins need to be processed intracellularly before being recognized by T cells. In 1985, members of his lab published one of the most highly cited, pivotal immunology articles of all time, which demonstrated that major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are able to bind peptides and that these MHC-peptide complexes activate T cells. Unanue's current work continues to build on these ground-breaking antigen processing and presentation studies in the context of mouse models of autoimmune diabetes and Listeria monocytogenes infection. Unanue has been an AAI member since 1966 and has shown his dedication to serving his fellow AAI members over a span of 30 years. He has served as both associate editor and section editor of The Journal of Immunology (The JI), as well as member and chair of the editorial board. Unanue has also served as member and chair of the Travel Awards, Publications, and Nominating Committees and as a member of the Education Committee. He has spoken at AAI annual meetings as an AAI Distinguished Lecturer and delivered the Minority Affairs Guest Lecture. Unanue's commitment to scientic service has been wide- reaching. He has held positions on scientic advisory boards for the Lupus Research Institute, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Pew National Advisory Council, and the National Advisory Allergy and Infectious Diseases Council. In addition to his service to The JI, Unanue has served on editorial boards for numerous other scientic journals. Unanue received his medical degree from the University of Havana School of Medicine in 1960, before serving as a research fellow consecutively at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, California, and the National Institute for Medical Research in London, England. In 1970, he became a faculty member of Harvard Medical School, where he attained and held the position of Mallinckrodt Professor of Immunopathology from 1974-1984. In 1985, Unanue relocated to the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, where he resided as chairman of the Department of Pathology and Immunology and Pathologist-in-Chief of Barnes-Jewish Hospital until 2006 and now acts as the Paul and Ellen Lacy Professor of Pathology and Immunology in the Department of Pathology and Immunology. Unanue has received many accolades for his scientic contributions to basic science and immunology. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, and the Alpha Omega Alpha Honorary Medical Society. He is also a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Unanue is a recipient of the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research and William B. Coley awards, the Robert Koch Gold Medal, and the Gairdner Foundation International Award, in addition to many others. Unanue's dedication to science and service epitomizes the spirit of giving and accomplishment honored by the AAI Lifetime Achievement Award. The AAI Lifetime Achievement Award is given annually in recognition of distinguished scientic accomplishment and extraordinary service to AAI. AAI Excellence in Mentoring Award Bestowed upon William E. Paul William E. Paul, M.D., National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is the recipient of the 2014 AAI Excellence in Mentoring Award in recognition of his contributions to a future generation of scientists. Dr. Paul, a highly productive researcher in the eld of cytokine biology, is well known for the discovery of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and his demonstration of its functions in T helper cell differentiation. His investigations of almost every aspect of IL-4\u2014cellular, genomic, regulatory, and signaling\u2014have greatly enhanced our understanding of this molecule. His other legacy is the impressive number of successful scientists who have trained in his lab. Of the more than 75 postdoctoral trainees he has mentored, many have gone on to occupy posts as professors at universities in the United States, Europe, and Asia; NIH senior investigators; high ofce-holders at universities and scientic foundations; or high ofcers at scientic corporations. Three are members of the National Academy of Sciences. 2014 AAI Career Award Recipients AAI proudly presents the 2014 AAI Awards for outstanding research and career achievements. 8 AAI Newsletter March-April 2014 His past trainees laud Paul for his scholarly knowledge, his rigor in evaluating experimental data, and his open-mindedness to new ideas. \"He liked ideas and considered those from junior fellows, including ideas that contradicted his own (especially those that contradicted his own), with great respect,\" says a former fellow, Fred Finkelman, McDonald Professor of Medicine and professor of pediatrics at the University of Cincinnati School of Medicine. \"I learned that a hypothesis was an idea to test, not something to prove; that data take precedence over theories, which are usually wrong; and that results have to be reproducible and to make sense.\" Another past trainee, Anthony DeFranco, professor, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco, expands, recalling when early experiments in the laboratory suggested that B cell activation was MHC-restricted: \"I remember his saying, 'This experiment may convince reviewers, but does it convince us?' I think that statement fully encapsulates Bill's view. He wants to get the right answer; publishing papers and being an author isn't what is important, getting the right answer is what is important. [We] then went back to the drawing board and came up with an experimental setup that Bill now agreed would test the question without leaving uncertainty....When this experiment was done, we convincingly got the opposite answer, which agrees well with understanding 30 years later.\" Paul's past fellows commend his generosity and selflessness, describing how Paul shifted his own research efforts to give former trainees room to grow their independent research programs. He is described as not taking credit of authorship on publications resulting from projects he had guided or encouraged, including discoveries of enormous impact to the eld. Former fellow Mark M. Davis, Burt and Marion Avery Family Professor of Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, refers to his work on T cell receptor cloning as an example. \"When this ultimately worked, in the early summer of 1983, Bill did another extraordinary thing, which was that he never asked for any credit of authorship, but was entirely content to stay in the background. This was incredibly selfless of Bill, and I can think of no other scientist I could be sure would act the same way.\" Further exemplifying Dr. Paul's generosity is his orchestrated campaign to arrange the return of a Taiwanese fellow, who, because he had not yet fullled his military service requirement as a citizen of Taiwan, was denied permission to return from visiting his parents there. Paul's prodigious efforts resulted in the former trainee's return to report to his rst faculty post within months, not years. It is most tting that Dr. Paul be recognized for his remarkable record of mentorship with the 2014 AAI Excellence in Mentoring Award. Paul obtained his M.D. from the State University of New York in 1960. Following internship and residency at Massachusetts Memorial Hospitals (Boston Medical Center), he served as a clinical associate in the Endocrinology Branch at the National Cancer Institute and then as a research fellow and instructor at the New York University School of Medicine. He moved to the Laboratory of Immunology, NIAID, NIH, as a principal investigator in 1968. He was appointed to his current position of chief of the Laboratory of Immunology in 1970. In 2007, Paul was accorded the honor of being named an NIH Distinguished Investigator.Dr. Paul is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Among other prestigious honors received in recognition of his scientic accomplishment are the AAI Lifetime Achievement Award, the International Cytokine Society Honorary Lifetime Achievement Award, the Max Delbr\u00fcck Medal, the Abbott Laboratories Award in Clinical and Diagnostic Immunology from the American Academy of Microbiology, and the Life Sciences Award from the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB). A member of AAI since 1967, Paul was elected to AAI Council in 1981 and served as AAI president from 1986 to 1987. He has also served as a member and chair of the AAI Nominating and Program Committees, a member of the AAI Awards and Finance Committees, an AAI representative to the FASEB Board and IUIS General Assembly, a Distinguished Lecturer at the AAI annual meeting, a faculty member at the AAI Introductory Course, and an editor for The Journal of Immunology. The AAI Excellence in Mentoring Award is presented annually in recognition of exemplary career contributions to a future generation of scientists. Carl H. June Presented with the AAI-Steinman Award for Human Immunology Research Carl H. June, M.D., University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, is the recipient of the 2014 AAI-Steinman Award for Human Immunology Research. This award is given in recognition of his groundbreaking research on the control of T cell responses and the development of adoptive T cell transfer therapies. In the 1980s, before the term \"costimulation\" was widely used, Dr. June showed that CD28 induced T cell activation and proliferation by a pathway independent of T cell receptor signaling. He and his colleagues then elaborated on the signaling pathway, showing its role in the survival of activated T cells and its induction by the B7 family of ligands. For nearly two decades, June has also been dedicated to applying his knowledge of T cell costimulation to the development of new T cell therapies for HIV infection and human malignancies. His laboratory developed a cell culture system to generate large numbers of HIV-specic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells rapidly using gamma retroviruses that were tested in clinical trials of HIV patients. He also conducted a clinical evaluation of lentiviral vectors to modify T cells, initially in HIV . In 2011, June and his colleagues reported the rst successful use of CD19-targeted CAR T cells in patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), with two of three patients undergoing complete remission and one partial remission. The modied T cells were termed \"serial killers\" because each infused T cell was able to kill at least 1,000 tumor cells. These effects have since been shown to be dur able, and www.aai.org AAI Newsletter 9 the team has reported similar antitumor responses in more CLL patients, as well as patients with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Work is underway to use the same strategy to treat other malignancies. The successful application of CAR T cells to treat cancer has generated much recent excitement and offered new hope to the cancer patient community. \"Dr. June brought several unique things to this work that made it successful,\" says Kenneth M. Murphy, professor and HHMI investigator, Washington University School of Medicine. \"It required Dr. June's understanding of the detailed signaling properties of T cells and costimulatory pathways in order to engineer into the CAR constructs the appropriate type of signaling properties that made the chimeric receptors work in the proper type and quality of activation. But well beyond this, it took an ever greater (in my opinion) degree of personal dedication to the real application of this to human problems... Dr. June took enormous personal effort to organize the clinical translational side, which is far beyond the typical challenge of basic research in immunology.\" June earned his M.D. from Baylor College of Medicine in 1979. Following a research fellowship at the World Health Organization, he completed his internship and residency at the National Naval Medical Center and then a fellowship in oncology at the University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. In 1986, he joined the faculty of Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, holding the rank of full professor at his departure in 1999. He currently serves as professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine. Dr. June is a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Association of Physicians. In addition to these honors, June has received the Ernest Beutler Prize from the American Society of Hematology, the William B. Coley Award in Tumor Immunology from the Cancer Research Institute, the Philadelphia Award, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Freedom to Discover Award, the Federal Laboratory Award for Excellence in Technology Transfer, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of America, and the Dexter Conrad Award from the Ofce of Naval Research. June has been an AAI member since 1987 and has served AAI as a faculty member at the AAI Introductory Course in Immunology, a Major Symposium chair and speaker at the AAI annual meeting, and an associate editor for The Journal of Immunology. The AAI-Steinman Award for Human Immunology Research is presented annually for signicant, sustained achievement in immunology research pertinent to human disease pathogenesis, prevention, or therapy.AAI-Life Technologies Meritorious Career Award Conferred upon Timothy A. Springer Timothy A. Springer, Ph.D., Harvard Medical School, was chosen to receive the 2014 AAI-Life Technologies Meritorious Career Award for his seminal contributions to the discovery of immune cell adhesion molecules and the determination of how these proteins mediate cell-cell interactions and extravasation of hematopoietic cells into tissues. He has published well over 500 articles, several of which have been cited more than 1,000 times, making his \"scientic impact\" nearly immeasurable. Early in his career, Dr. Springer's lab discovered the rst known adhesion ICAM-2, and ICAM-3. The discovery of these molecules altered paradigms regarding cell-cell interactions, which, at that time, were thought to be regulated solely by specic receptors for antigen, complement, and Fc. Springer's lab also dened other adhesion molecules and chemoattractants, including selectins and SDF-1. These initial studies led to other dogma-shifting discoveries; notably, his lab demonstrated that inside-out signaling regulates adhesion molecule dynamics and helped dene the mechanism of extravasation. His work also dened the structural basis for integrin activation, showing how conformational changes can be communicated across membranes to regulate ligand binding. Springer's work has spanned the bounds from basic research to clinical applications. He was instrumental in the discovery of mutations in adhesion molecule genes that caused leukocyte adhesion deciency, a life-threatening disorder. Springer's lab dened molecules important to the understanding of human viral immunology, characterizing cell surface receptors that are used for HIV and rhinovirus entry to the cell. His research has also led to the development of several therapeutics targeting adhesion molecules that have been applied to autoimmune diseases, including alefacept, efalizumab, and natalizumab. Springer has also founded biological companies, including Scholar Rock and Leukocyte, Inc., which was later purchased by Millennium Pharmaceuticals. Michael Dustin, Muriel G. and George W. Singer Professor of Molecular Immunology at New York University School of Medicine, a former trainee of Springer's, describes Springer as \"a creative force with great insights and determination to get things done. I found him an inspirational leader as a student and continue to look to him as a leader in the eld of cell adhesion.\" Springer received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in biochemistry and molecular biology in 1976 and continued his training as a postdoctoral fellow in Cesar Milstein's lab at the University of Cambridge, England. He then returned to Harvard University as an assistant professor in 1977 and has remained a faculty member there ever since, holding appointments from the chief of the Laboratory of Membrane Immunochemistry 10 AAI Newsletter March-April 2014 at Dana Farber Cancer Institute to his current positions as Latham Family Professor and professor of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology at Harvard Medical School and professor of medicine and senior investigator of the Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine at Children's Hospital Boston. He also holds honorary professorships at several international universities and advises a number of pharmaceutical companies. Dr. Springer is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In addition to these honors, he has received NIH MERIT Grant Awards, the Basic Research Prize from the American Heart Association, the Crafoord Prize in Polyarthritis from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and many other awards. He has served on a number of journal editorial boards, including Cellular Immunology, Journal of Clinical Immunology, and Immunological Reviews. Springer has also acted as a member of NIH study sections, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Scientic Review Board, a National Research Council Committee, and the Board of Trustees at Children's Hospital Boston. An AAI member since 1979, Springer has served as a block symposium chair for the AAI annual meeting, a member of the Nominating Committee, and an associate editor for The Journal of Immunology. The AAI-Life Technologies Meritorious Career Award is given annually for outstanding research contributions to the eld of immunology. Katherine A. Fitzgerald Receives the AAI-BD Biosciences Investigator Award Katherine A. Fitzgerald, Ph.D., University of Massachusetts Medical School, was chosen to receive the 2014 AAI-BD Biosciences Investigator Award. She has made fundamental contributions to our understanding of innate immune signaling and function. This trajectory began with her early discovery of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) adapter molecule known as Mal (or TIRAP), as a fellow in the laboratory of Luke O'Neill at Trinity College Dublin. Upon moving to the University of Massachusetts in 2002, she has expanded her research into new areas and has continued to make high-profile discoveries, first in the laboratory of Douglas Golenbock and then as an independent investigator. These include the discovery of another TLR adapter, TRAM; identification of TBK1 and IKK-epsilon as kinases that phosphorylate and activate the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7; discovery of the AIM2 inflammasome and its role in recognition of microbial DNA; and demonstration that TRIF-dependent signaling by TLR4 licenses NLRP3 inflammasome activation by Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, recent studies in the Fitzgerald laboratory have provided new evidence for the importance of regulatory long-coding RNAs in innate immune cells. \"Dr. Fitzgerald is an extremely talented, creative, and productive investigator whose contributions are exceptional both for their scope and overall impact on the field of innate immunity,\" says Kenneth L. Rock, professor and chair, Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Medical School. \"Over the past five years, she has fearlessly expanded her research program into new arenas, and, in each case, her innovative approach and clever insights have rapidly identified her as a true super-star in that discipline,\" adds Ann Marshak-Rothstein, professor, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School. Fitzgerald earned her Ph.D. in biochemistry from Trinity College Dublin in Ireland in 1999. Following a postdoctoral fellowship at Trinity, she joined the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Massachusetts Medical School as a recipient of a Wellcome Trust International Research Award in 2002. In 2004, she joined the faculty as an assistant professor and is currently professor of medicine and co-director of the Program in Innate Immunity. Other prestigious awards and honors received by Fitzgerald include the Eli Lilly and Company-Elanco Research Award from the American Society for Microbiology, the International Cytokine Society Young Investigator Award, the Milstein Young Investigator Award, and the Donegan Medal from the Irish Royal Academy of Medicine. An AAI member since 2006, Dr. Fitzgerald currently serves as a section editor for The Journal of Immunology (The JI). She previously was an associate editor for The JI and a Major Symposium chair and speaker at the AAI annual meeting. Dr. Fitzgerald has assumed numerous leadership positions at the University of Massachusetts, coordinating a scientific writing course and vice-chairing the immunology and virology graduate program, among others. She also has served the international innate immunity community by serving on NIH study sections and helping to organize various international scientific meetings. The AAI-BD Biosciences Investigator Award is presented annually for outstanding, early-career research contributions to the field of immunology. 2014 AWARD PRESENTATIONS AND LECTURES For details on this year's AAI Awards Presentations and Lectures at IMMUNOLOGY 2014, see pages 23 and 25.www.aai.org AAI Newsletter 11 Jeremy M. Boss, Ph.D. Emory University School of Medicine Jeremy M. Boss, AAI '94, has provided crucial leadership to AAI in his service as editor-in-chief of The Journal of Immunology (The JI) from 2008 to 2013. During his tenure, Dr. Boss worked continuously to maintain and improve the quality of peer review in The JI. He also spearheaded efforts to ensure that The JI continues to evolve and keep pace with available technology in the digital media age, implementing multiple technological advancements to enhance user-friendliness and accessibility of The JI. These included launching \"Next in The JI, \" a feature that allows subscribers online access to the author-approved version of the article about three weeks earlier than publication in the journal issue; creating a podcast version of the \"In This Issue\" section of The JI, called \"ImmunoCasts;\" implementing RSS feeds; and adding online usage metrics for articles published in The JI. Boss was also instrumental in the creation of The JI site for mobile devices to improve ease of readability for users accessing The JI from handheld mobile devices. Boss has led several other signicant developments in The JI during his term. He oversaw improvements to the online manuscript-submission system and worked with reviewers, editors, and staff to reduce the average time from submission to decision for manuscripts submitted to The JI. He also introduced the \"Translating Immunology\" section, which explains, in general and historical terms, immunological discoveries that have led to advances in treatment, drugs, or diagnostic devices. In addition, \" Author Choice,\" an optional, fee-based feature that allows authors to make their article freely available immediately upon publication, was launched. In addition to his appointment as editor-in-chief, Boss has served as a deputy editor and associate editor of The JI. He is also a past invited symposium speaker and presenter in scientic writing and mentoring workshops at AAI annual meetings. Dr. Boss received his Ph.D. (biology) from the State University of New York at Albany in 1982, before becoming a postdoctoral fellow in Jack Strominger's lab in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Harvard University. In 1986, he joined Emory University's faculty, where he currently holds appointments as professor and chair of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology in the School of Medicine.Kristin A. Hogquist, Ph.D. University of Minnesota Kristin A. Hogquist, AAI '95, has provided exemplary leadership and outstanding dedication as chair of the AAI Program Committee from 2009 to 2012. Her efforts sustained and enhanced the standard for excellence in scientic and social programming that characterizes the AAI annual meetings and advances the interests of AAI members at every career stage. She oversaw the development of the scientic program of the AAI annual meetings, from the designation of AAI Distinguished Lecturers and Major Symposia chairs to the organization of abstract sessions and the participation of guest societies and NIH institutes. During her tenure, Dr. Hogquist displayed exemplary commitment to ensuring that all facets of immunology are represented at the AAI annual meetings and helped facilitate the restructuring of abstract submission topics to better reflect the expanding continuum of immunology research. AAI annual meeting attendance reached near-record levels during Hogquist's term, a reflection, at least in part, of her dedication to providing extensive, current, and relevant scientic programming at the AAI annual meetings. Beyond her extensive contributions as chair of the AAI Program Committee, Hogquist has provided other immeasurable service to the AAI organization. She has acted as section editor of The Journal of Immunology (The JI), chair of the AAI Nominating Committee, member of the AAI Committee on the Status of Women, and mentor for the AAI High School Teachers Summer Research Program.

Havran, Ph.D., AAI '85, has been named to chair the AAI Program Committee for a three-year term beginning on July 1 of this year. Havran, who served on the Program Committee from 2005 to 2008, will succeed interim program chair and past AAI president Leslie Berg, who assumed leadership of the committee last summer following the death of Leo Lefran\u00e7ois. Havran is a professor in the Department of Immunology and Microbial Science at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) in La Jolla, California. Her research has pursued a long-term interest in interactions between intraepithelial \u0003T cells and their neighboring epithelial cells. Findings on the part of Havran and her colleagues have dened unique properties of these cells and support a specialized role for epithelial\u0003\u0003T cells in immune surveillance, wound repair, inflammation, and protection from malignancy. The group's identication of cell surface molecules and growth factors regulating epithelial T cell functional responses has increased understanding of the role that these cells play in epithelial and mucosal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, malignancies, and wound healing. Their studies continue to address the debilitating problem of chronic wounds; new information gained is utilized to modulate\u0003\u0003T cell responses and develop new strategies to accelerate healing. In addition to her past service on the AAI Program Committee, Havran served as an annual meeting abstract programming chair and, on multiple occasions, as a Major Symposium chair and speaker at the AAI meeting. She has also served on the AAI Publications Committee, AAI Nominating Committee, AAI Awards Committee, and AAI Committee on the Status of Women. She is a past associate and section editor for The Journal of Immunology and past AAI Advanced Course in Immunology instructor. Her additional service appointments include participation on multiple review panels at NIH - including at NIAID (ad hoc consultant, Board of Scientic Counselors), NIDDK, and NIGMS - as well as for other organizations including the European Research Council, Institut National du Cancer (France), Scripps Translational Science Institute, U.S. Department of Defense Medical Research Program, Cancer Research UK, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Wellcome Trust, and American Heart Association. She has served on the editorial board for Immunological Reviews, as chair and scientic committee member in organizing the International\u0003\u0003T Cell Conference (multiple occasions), and as co-chair and council member in organizing the Midwinter Conference of Immunologists (multiple occasions). Her career honors include: honorary doctorate, University of Copenhagen, Denmark; Stohlman Scholar Award, Leukemia & Lymphoma Society; Leukemia Society of America Scholar; Lucille P . Markey Scholar in Biomedical Science; NIH Postdoctoral Training Grant Fellowship; NIH Predoctoral Training Grant Fellowship; University of Chicago Fellowship; Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger Scholarship; and Mary Gibbs Jones Scholarship. A native of Houston, Havran is a zoology graduate of Duke University. After serving as a research analyst at Duke, she received her Ph.D. in immunology from the University of Chicago (advisor: Frank Fitch, AAI '61). Havran then trained as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, (mentor: Jim Allison, AAI '78) before joining the Department of Immunology at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) as an assistant member in 1991. She was appointed TSRI associate professor in 1995 and full professor in 2006. She holds additional faculty appointments with TSRI's Kellogg School of Science and Technology; Strohm Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center, Scripps Clinic; Markey Trust Graduate Program, University of California, San Diego; and the Division of Dermatology, University of California, San Diego.

Dr. Morton acquired the guns after treating the famous actor for stomach cancer. John Kirkwood, M.D., a former colleague and now a melanoma expert at the University of Pittsburgh and a CRI scientic advisor, calls Morton's knowledge of cancer immunology and melanoma \"encyclopedic.\" \"We have lost a giant in our eld,\" he says. As aggressive as Dr. Morton was in the operating room, he was the exact opposite in his personal life. \"Dr. Morton was gentle and respectful, a cowboy hunting down only melanomas,\" says Stan. Donald Lee Morton was born on September 12, 1934, in Richwood, West Virginia. His father was a coal miner, and young Donald grew up without electricity or running water. He attended Berea College in Kentucky on scholarship before transferring to the University of California, Berkeley. He received his medical degree from the University of California, San Francisco, in 1958. He did postgraduate work at the National Cancer Institute and was for many years chief of the Division of Surgical Oncology at UCLA before establishing the John Wayne Cancer Institute at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, where he served as chief of the melanoma program. Dr. Morton served as president of the International Sentinel Node Society, the Society of Surgical Oncology, and the World Federation of Surgical Oncology Societies. He was a member of the CRI Scientic Advisory Council for more than 40 years.The following tribute to AAI member Donald Morton, M.D., who died on January 10, was published on the Cancer Research Institute (CRI) blog and authored by CRI Science Writer Matthew Tontonoz. It is reprinted here with the permission of CRI. Remembering Donald Morton, a Medical Pioneer CRI lost a devoted member of its community this month, 79-year-old Donald Morton, M.D., who died of heart failure. Morton was a longtime member of CRI's Scientic Advisory Council, and a world expert on melanoma\u2014a disease for which he revolutionized diagnosis and treatment. In the 1970s, when Dr. Morton was a young surgeon, the established way of determining whether melanoma had spread to the lymph nodes was to remove a large number of surrounding nodes. The procedure was invasive, and often proved unnecessary since the nodes turned out to be clean. Dr. Morton pioneered a new approach, which involved removing only the closest lymph node and testing it for signs of cancer. If no cancer was found, then this could be taken as a sign that the cancer had not spread further. This \"sent inel node\" (Dr. Morton's term) was identied by injecting the tumor with dye, which would then spread via lymphatic vessels to each node in the chain. The technique proved to be a reliable method of diagnosis, and quickly became established medical practice\u2014not only for melanoma but also for breast cancer and other cancers that spread via the lymphatic system. In addition to being a skilled surgeon, Dr. Morton was also a forward thinking tumor immunologist. He was an early proponent of cancer vaccines and of using immune-stimulating chemicals to boost the immune system's power to ght cancer. His strategy of injecting bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) directly into tumors represented the rst successful clinical use of immunotherapy against a metastatic human cancer. Dr. Morton later had melanoma himself, but it was caught early enough to be completely removed by surgery. Students and colleagues remember Dr. Morton as an intellectual force to be reckoned with, a kind of cowboy in the Wild West of cancer. \"I'll never forget when I walked into his ofce for my interview and the rst thing I saw were two big guns that belonged to John Wayne nicely hung in a display case on the wall!

Among the scientists who arrived in the late 1940s and 1950s were several distinguished members of the American Association of Immunologists (AAI), including Jonas Salk (AAI '47), (AAI '65). We chronicle below the achievements of these and other leading immunologists and their roles in shaping the history of immunology in Pittsburgh. Early Medical Research in Pittsburgh The discovery of large coal veins in 1833 brought rapid industrialization to Pittsburgh. The transformation of Pittsburgh from a small frontier city to an industrial center was accelerated by the mass production of steel and the heightened demand for that product during the American Civil War. The city's prominence in higher education and medicine, however, experienced a slower emergence. Western University of Pittsburgh was incorporated in 1813 1 but lacked a sizable enrollment until the turn of the twentieth century. It was not until 1853, following a decade that witnessed endemic typhoid and tuberculosis, as well as multiple outbreaks of smallpox and cholera, that the \u00bfrst chartered public hospital, Western Pennsylvania Hospital, opened its doors. 2 A group of local physicians chartered the \u00bfrst medical school in 1883, and construction began after 250 shares of stock were sold for $100 each. 3 Western Pennsylvania Medical College opened its doors to the \u00bfrst class in 1886. Initially, the college was completely autonomous, but in 1892, it entered into a formal relationship with Western University, of\u00bfcially becoming the Medical Department of Western University, although it was the stockholders, not the university, who had ownership and authority over the department. Western University underwent dramatic changes in 1908 to raise both the standards and prominence of the school. A new name\u2014the University of Pittsburgh\u2014was adopted, the campus was relocated from its site in Pittsburgh's North Side section to the Oakland area of the city; and the university formally acquired the medical college. With full control of what was now the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, the administration of Pitt hired a new chancellor, Samuel McCormick, who, modeling the institution on the top medical schools in the country, began recruiting accomplished researchers for faculty positions and raising the standards for enrollment and graduation. Facilities and opportunities for clinical research followed, as a new medical school building was opened in 1911, and formal relationships were forged with St. Francis and Mercy hospitals in 1912. The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine was not the only medical research institution in the city in these years. The William H. Singer Memorial Research Laboratory was founded at Allegheny General Hospital in 1914 as a research laboratory dedicated to the study of medical and surgical problems. Its staff included Oscar M. Teague (AAI '20), a noted bacteriologist and the \u00bf rst active AAI member in Pittsburgh, 4 as well as other researchers, who, although not AAI members, published early articles in The Journal of Immunology (The JI ). 5 Western Pennsylvania Hospital also attracted talented immunologists AAI LOOKS BACK The Emergence of Immunology in Pittsburgh by Bryan Peery and John Emrich With IMMUNOLOGY 2014 taking place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, May 2-6, AAI salutes the current prominence of this city in biomedical research and reflects on the individuals and events contributing to its emergence as an international center for immunology.

Locke (AAI '26) and Ralph R. Mellon (AAI '22) were researchers in the laboratories from the 1930s until the 1950s. The stature of the medical research in Pittsburgh steadily increased from the 1910s through the mid-1940s, but a series of events\u2014the First World War, the Great Depression, and the Second World War\u2014delayed more rapid progress until the end of the 1940s. Post-War Pittsburgh Renaissance Turning the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine into a \u00bfrst-rate research institution had been William S. Mc (llroy's aspiration since his election as dean by the medical school faculty in 1938. 6 Born into an af \u00c0uent Pittsburgh family, Mc (llroy had personal connections to Pittsburgh's private donors who might turn his dream into a reality. Resources and focus for Mc( llroy's plan were soon diverted to the U.S. war effort following the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. With the war's end in 1945, however, Mc( llroy and Pitt bene \u00bftted from the \u00bfnancing and enthusiasm of industrialists and philanthropists united in efforts to usher in \"the Pittsburgh Renaissance.\" Their plan for revitalizing the city included drastically improving public health. Mc (llroy encouraged the university chancellor to use a portion of the new endowment to fund a university-wide interdisciplinary research program known as the Division of Research in the Natural Sciences. 7 Furthermore, in 1948, the Graduate School of Public Health was founded at Pitt with a $13.6 million endowment from the Andrew W. Mellon (ducation and &haritable Trust. 8 Mc( llroy sought to make sure the medical and public health schools' interests were closely aligned. He found an ally in the dean of the new public health program, former U.S. Surgeon General Thomas Parran, Jr., 9 who argued that the success of the Graduate School of Public Health would depend on the School of Medicine's receiving the investment necessary to become a top-\u00c0 ight institution. 10 With \u00bfnancial backing and the new Division of Research serving as an indicator of the direction in which Pitt was heading, Mc(llroy began recruiting researchers from around the country. &onvincing established scientists to tie their fates to the nascent program proved dif \u00bfcult because the appointments lacked status. Younger scientists, however, could be attracted by the promise of independence and a unique opportunity to expedite their advancement through the academic ranks. 11 One researcher who was looking for just such an opportunity was Jonas Salk. Jonas Salk and Polio Research at Pitt After the war, Mc( llroy, recognizing virology as a young but promising \u00bf eld that might soon put Pitt on the map, began fundraising for virus research. In 1946, he secured funds from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) to start a Virus Research Laboratory. 12 His search for a director of the new laboratory led him to an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, Jonas (. Salk. Although Salks's credentials were respectable, he was hardly a luminary in 1947, and there was little to indicate that he would become the legend that he is today. 13 The eldest son of working-class Russian immigrants, Salk grew up in the Bronx, New York, and attended & ity & ollege of New York during the Great Depression before earning his M.D. from the New York University (NYU) & ollege of Medicine in 1939. At NYU, he studied under William H. Park (AAI '16, president 1918-19) and Thomas Francis, Jr. (AAI '30, president 1949-50), who Jonas Salk and Julius S.

The previous year, Francis had become chair of the Department of Epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health and director of the , n\u00c0uen]a &ommission of the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board. Francis brought Salk to Michigan, helping Salk secure both a National 5esearch &ouncil Fellowship and a draft deferment. 15 After \u00bfve years under Francis, Salk grew restless, desiring a promotion and more independence. He and Francis had a cordial relationship, but Francis could offer only an assistant professorship. When McEllroy promised to make Salk an associate professor and head of the Virus Research Laboratory at Pitt in 1947, he immediately accepted the offer. 16 At the time of Salk's arrival in Pittsburgh, the medical school's transition to major research institution was far from complete. Salk soon reali ]ed that it fell upon him to be an impetus for change. He later recalled the shock of learning that most of his colleagues \"were part-time instructors who earned their living in private practice and had neither the time nor inclination for basic research.\" 17 He would have to build his laboratory from the ground up\u2014literally. Starting with two rooms and a technician in the basement of Municipal Hospital, he waged what one colleague recalled as \"a kind of guerilla war\" for space and funding. 18 He continued his investigations into in\u00c0uen]a virus but increasingly turned to poliomyelitis virus, at least in part because he knew this research would attract funding. 19 When NFIP approached him in late 1947 about doing the tedious technical work of typing poliovirus, Salk readily agreed to do what senior researchers had shunned. In return, he received large research grants, beginning in 1948, to help him build his laboratory. 20 By 1949, his laboratory and of\u00bfces had expanded to two \u00c0oors in Municipal Hospital, he had been promoted to full professor, and he was hiring his own research faculty. One of the scientists whom he brought into his laboratory was Julius S. Youngner (AAI '50) from the University of Michigan, who, as a senior assistant research scientist at the National &ancer Institute, had speciali ]ed in cell culture techniques. Youngner would remain an active member of the Pitt faculty for the next 50 years. By 1951, Salk's laboratory had completed its typing project, concluding that there were three distinct types of poliovirus. The lab shifted its efforts to producing a vaccine. Based on the success that his mentor Francis had had with a killed-virus \u00c0u vaccine, Salk chose to pursue a killed-poliovirus vaccine over the attenuated-virus vaccine that the majority of other scientists, including his rivals Albert B. Sabin (AAI '46) and Hilary Koprowski (AAI '46), preferred. Even within the small community of researchers at Pitt, Salk had competition. In 1950, Parran recruited William McDowall Hammon (AAI '46) to chair the Department of Epidemiology and Microbiology at the Graduate School of Public Health. Unlike Salk, who had no experience with polio research when he was hired to head the Virus Research Laboratory, Hammon had already established himself in the \u00bfeld when Parran convinced him to leave his position as dean of the School of Public Health at the University of &alifornia, Berkeley, for Pittsburgh. Wary of both killed-virus and attenuated-virus vaccines, Hammon preferred passive immuni ]ation through gamma-globulin injections containing polio-resistant antibodies. He conceded that passive immuni ]ation would not prevent infection, but he argued that it could prevent the worst symptom of infection\u2014paralysis. NFIP-funded, double-blind trials involving more than 50,000 children in 1951 and 1952 yielded compelling evidence that passive immuni ]ation was a major step in the war against AAI LOOKS BACK Jonas Salk inoculating a young girl History of Medicine Division, National Library of Medicine p William M.

Unfortunately, as Hammon himself pointed out, the immunity produced was only temporary, and the gamma-globulin was in short supply. 21 Meanwhile, Hammon's passive immunization approach was eclipsed by Salk's March 1953 announcement of the successful completion of the \u00bfrst human trials of his group's killed-virus vaccine. 22 7he national \u00bfeld trial, which involved more than 1.8 million children and was overseen by Thomas Francis, commenced in June 1954, and, on April 12, 1955, Francis pronounced the vaccine safe and effective. 23 Salk instantly became a celebrity scientist, receiving a Presidential Citation and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1955 and the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award the following year. Although Salk left Pitt to head the Salk Institute in 1963, his accomplishments of the 1950s cemented Pitt's reputation as a major research center for medical sciences. Frank Dixon and the \"Pittsburgh Five\" In addition to attracting national attention through his own laboratory studies, Salk's administrative work helped contribute to the effort to transform Pitt into a major research institution. As the head of the search committee for a chair of the Department of Pathology in the medical school in 1951, Salk selected a scientist who shared several key characteristics with him: Frank J. Dixon was young, ambitious, and not yet well-known. 24 Dixon had grown up in St. Paul, Minnesota, and had attended the University of Minnesota, where he earned his M.D. in 1942 before entering the medical corps of the U.S. Marine Corps and serving in the Paci\u00bfc Theater. Upon his return to the United States in 1946, Dixon became a research assistant in the Department of Pathology at Harvard. He moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1948, where he was an instructor in the Department of Pathology at Washington University for two years before being promoted to assistant professor in 1950. The following year, Salk and his search committee offered a full professorship and the chair of the Department of Pathology to Dixon, who, at age 31, became the youngest department head at Pitt. 25 As a research assistant at Harvard in 1946, Dixon had developed a new technique for labeling and tracking the location of proteins in the body using radioactive iodine. 26 At Pitt, he used this procedure to study serum sickness and soon discovered that the host's antibody immune response to foreign proteins in the injected serum caused deposition of immune complexes in tissues that led to tissue destruction. 27 From these results, Dixon made a novel and important conclusion\u2014the body's immune response could have deleterious effects on the health of the host. Dixon's careful methodology in the study of serum sickness and kidney disease served as a paradigm for immune complex- mediated disease pathogenesis and established the \u00bf eld of immunopathology, a discipline critical to the understanding of autoimmune diseases, such as lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. In his second year at Pitt, Dixon received the Theobald Smith Award of the American Association for the Advan cement of Science, an honor bestowed u pon the most outstanding medical researcher under the age of 35.

Jerne next headed the Biological Standards and Immunology sections of the World Health Organization in Geneva from 1956 to 1962, but, wishing to return to academic life and his immunological research, he seized the opportunity to chair the Department of Microbiology at Pitt when it arose in 1962. The change of venues paid immediate dividends. Jerne, regarded as one of immunology's greatest theorists, returned to the laboratory and made an important technical innovation. With Albert A. Nordin (AAI '72), a post-doc at Pitt, he developed the plaque-forming cell assay\u2014often called the Jerne plaque assay\u2014which advanced the study of immunology at the cellular level by allowing researchers to see and enumerate antibody-producing cells in an agar plate. 36 Jerne left Pittsburgh in 1966, succeeded at Pitt by Julius Youngner, who chaired the Department of Microbiology from 1966 to 1989. Jerne returned to Europe and directed the Paul Ehrlich Institute before becoming the founding director of the Basel Institute for Immunology in 1969. In recognition of his maMor contributions to the \u00bfeld of immunology, he was awarded the 1984 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. New Directions: 1980s-Present Neither the growth of the medical sciences at Pitt nor the role of AAI members in advancing it ended in the 1960s. Donald N. Medearis (AAI '65) succeeded Cheever as dean of the medical school, serving from 1969 to 1974. One of his most signi\u00bf cant acts as dean was recruiting Thomas Detre to head the Department of Psychiatry in 1974. 37 As senior vice chancellor of the health sciences from 1984 to 1998, Detre left a lasting legacy on UPMC. He oversaw the transformation of UPMC into a research hub of international renown by establishing several research institutes, including the Pittsburgh Transplantation Institute (renamed the Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute in 1996) and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) in 1985. 38 Under the direction of Ronald B. Herberman (AAI '69), UPCI was designated a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute, \u00bfve years after its establishment, making it the youngest center to receive such a distinction. 39 Moreover, it was at UPCI that immunology began to emerge as one of the more signi\u00bfcant areas of basic research at Pitt in the late 1980s. By 1997, the interdepartmental Graduate Program in Immunology had received accreditation and was authorized to award Ph.D. degrees. 40 In January 2002, the School of Medicine established the Department of Immunology and appointed Olivera J. Finn (AAI '83, president 2007-2008) its founding chair. 41 Although there is now a permanent home for the study of immunology at Pitt, studies in the \u00bfeld and AAI members remain ensconced in several departments and institutes across the university. Since 1997, Charles R. Rinaldo, Jr. (AAI '78), has served as chair of the Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology in the Graduate School of Public Health, the position once held by William Hammon. Recognizing parallels between the mid-century work on polio carried out by his predecessors at Pitt and his own research on HIV and AIDS, Rinaldo declared in a 2004 interview, \"I look to history to help me look to the future.\" 42 Salk, Dixon, Cheever, Jerne, and the many other AAI members who have called Pittsburgh home helped to establish the city as a major center for immunological research. In turn, Pittsburgh has contributed much to AAI. Five past presidents and one current councillor, Joanne L. Flynn (AAI '96, councillor 2013-present), have spent at least some of their professional years in Pittsburgh. Beginning with Arthur Locke, who became an associate editor of The JI in 1936, Pittsburgh immunologists have worked to ensure that The JI remains the preeminent journal in the \u00bfeld, most notably Joseph Feldman, who served as editor-in-chief from 1971 to 1987. Together, these immunologists have left behind an enduring legacy that continues to inform the work of immunologists the world over. Bryan D. Peery, Ph.D., AAI Assistant HistorianJohn S.

Cyster, HHMI, University of California, San Francisco Deciphering the guidance cue code for B cell immunity IMMUN OLOGY 2014PROGRAM PREVIEW Ronald President22 AAI Newsletter March-April 2014 During my postdoctoral years at the NIH as a self-respecting 96-well plate immunologist, I was amazed by the work of Ian MacLennan and Garnet Kelsoe, who were using immunohistology to study germinal centers. Their efforts convinced me that in vivo and, even better, in situ approaches were the best ways to study the immune response, especially if antigen-specic lymphocytes could be mapped onto the body's geography. Research in this area blossomed in the last two decades, revealing fundamental information about how lymphocytes enter, exit, and move within lymphoid organs and how antigen-specic T and B cells, and dendritic cells, initially nd each other, become activated, enter germinal centers, and migrate to non-lymphoid organs during immune responses. The President's Symposium this year features leaders who made many of the discoveries mentioned above. Ronald Germain was one of the rst to produce dynamic images of T cells interacting with antigen-bearing dendritic cells in lymph nodes. Imaging studies from his group have shown how T cells and dendritic cells sense chemokines to facilitate their interactions before and after foreign antigens enter the body. His recent work is producing insights into how effector T cells become activated in the non-lymphoid organs. Ellen Robey used real-time two-photon microscopy to study the cellular dynamics of CD8 + T cells and dendritic cells in lymph nodes. She revealed that T cells scan many dendritic cells in the absence of antigen but stop on antigen-bearing dendritic cells for hours. Her group has also characterized the dynamic interactions of thymocytes and thymic epithelial cells during positive and negative selection. Michel Nussenzweig discovered that dendritic cells can induce tolerance and that self- reactive B cells are abundant in the repertoire. His work has also been essential to the current understanding of somatic mutation, class-switch recombination, and formation of neutralizing antibodies to HIV . His dynamic imaging studies have identied many of the important events in afnity maturation in germinal centers. Jason Cyster revealed the key role that S1PR plays in lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs and how chemokines direct the migration and positioning of B cells in the body. He discovered that CXCR5 directs the migration of activated T cells to follicles, setting the stage for much later work on follicular helper T cell-B cell interactions. Please join me at the IMMUNOLOGY 2014 President's Symposium to see the latest discoveries by these outstanding investigators. The science should be enlightening and the presentations entertaining, with lots of colorful cells scurrying about. Someone bring the popcorn!PRESIDENT'S PROGRAM Marc K.

The goal of this workshop is to communicate these recommendations and guidelines, which will be published in The Journal of Immunology prior to IMMUNOLOGY 2014, to the wider scientic community, to provide a forum for discussion, and to gather feedback for adopting the recommended nomenclature in the future. The session will consist of one hour of scientic talks followed by a panel discussion, which will culminate with a vote from the floor to arrive at a decision regarding the proposed recommendations.

Classical biochemical techniques are semi-quantitative in nature and do not provide per-cell translocation measurements. Manual microscopy allows visual identication of nuclear translocation on a per-cell basis, but an objective and statistically rigorous assessment is difcult to obtain. To overcome these problems, we use the Amnis ImageStream \u00aeX Mk II and FlowSight\u00ae imaging flow cytometry platforms, which combine the quantitative power of flow cytometry with the spatial information provided by microscopy in one system. In this workshop, we will present three case studies, demonstrating the Amnis \u00ae NFkB translocation kit for the Amnis\u00ae imaging flow platform for the monitoring of NFkB translocation in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, THP-1 human acute monocytic leukemia cells, and peripheral blood monocytes. Innovative Tools and Approaches for Optimizing Multicolor Panel Design 10:15 AM - 11:15 AM EXHIBITOR WORKSHOP ROOM 2 BD BiosciencesPr esenters: Jurg Rohrer, Director, Research & Development Flow cytometry has been an indispensable tool for immunologists for almost 40 years. Over time, the technology has advanced from two fluorescent parameters to 18 and counting today. These advances have also made multicolor flow cytometry more accessible to researchers worldwide. To take full advantage of these flow cytometry tools, one must consider instrument capabilities, biology and antigen expression levels, the brightness of dyes, and the consequences to spillover. One of the recent advances has been the introduction of the Brilliant Violet and Ultraviolet dyes. These bright dyes offer additional options (other than PE) when a bright reagent is required. The tutorial will highlight why it is important to base one's dye choice not only on instrument capabilities but also on the expression level of the antigen studied and the brightness of the dye. We show that by making the correct choices, one can dramatically improve resolution of the populations studied.Multicolor Flow Cytometry on Your Benchtop: Introducing the Guava EasyCyte 12 11:15 AM - 12:15 PM EXHIBITOR WORKSHOP ROOM 1 EMD MilliporePr esenters: Jessica Reed, Product Manager Katherine Gillis, Application Scientist Multi-laser flow cytometers can dramatically increase the capability of cell analysis. However, traditional multicolor flow cytometers have required deep expertise and exclusive dedication of user resources. In this workshop, you will learn how the simplicity of the new guava easyCyte 12 can further your research. The guava easyCyte systems are microcapillary flow cytometers that enable you to obtain absolute cell counts and use low sample volumes. Additionally, the violet laser of the guava easyCyte 12 system increases the amount of information you can get from each well. For analysis, guava InCyte software provides an easy-to-use solution capable of answering complex questions for both tube- and plate-based assays. We will dive into the guava easyCyte 12 system performance and examples of multicolor whole-blood immunophenotyping experiments with no compensation. Genomics Meets Proteomics: Detect Non-coding and Viral RNA Using Flow Cytometry 11:15 AM - 12:15 PM EXHIBITOR WORKSHOP ROOM 2 eBioscience, an Affymetrix CompanyPr esenters: Susan Reynolds, Applications Scientist QuantiGene\u00ae FlowRNA enhances the understanding of transcription and gene regulation by advancing RNA detection within a single cell using a standard flow cytometer. This novel assay complements gene expression arrays by deepening the information gathered in heterogeneic cellular environments. Detection of RNA can be supplemented to many existing flow cytometry workflows to recognize transcriptional events in specic cell subsets, label cells expressing proteins for which there are limited or no commercially available antibodies, and potentially identify viral or non-coding RNA molecules. This workshop details the results of QuantiGene\u00ae FlowRNA technology currently used in the eld and discusses how these approaches allow a more comprehensive look at gene expression inside an individual cell.EXHIBITOR WORKSHOPS 52 AAI Newsletter March-April 2014EXHIBITOR WORKSHOPSSmartFlare Probes Enable Live Cell RNA Detection in Monocytes and Macrophages by Flow Cytometry 12:15 PM - 1:15 PM EXHIBITOR WORKSHOP ROOM 1 EMD MilliporePr esenters: Don S. Weldon, R&D Victor Koong, Product Manager The ability to detect gene expression in live monocytes and macrophages, as opposed to xed or lysed cells, would uncover far more physiologically relevant information based on the cell's response to given stimuli. Here, we present SmartFlare probes, a novel RNA detection technology capable of detecting specic mRNA and miRNA in live cells. This technology also enables the ability to perform downstream assays such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to enrich for a specic subpopulation of live cells based solely on their RNA expression prole. Following RNA detection with SmartFlare probes, cells remain viable and fully functional for use in downstream assays. Studying both protein and RNA in the same cells, as opposed to using duplicate wells, provides correlating data while preserving precious samples. SmartFlare probes can be used in conjunction with traditional antibody staining techniques to simultaneously detect mRNA and its protein product at the single cell level. The Benets of T Cell Immune Monitoring 12:15 PM - 1:15 PM EXHIBITOR WORKSHOP ROOM 2 Immudex USAPr esenters: Stephen T. Haley, Ph.D., Vice President Cellular immune monitoring assays have become much more reliable and are now an important tool for efcient development of immunotherapeutics. This is particularly pronounced in cancer immunotherapy and HIV research, but immune monitoring is also increasingly being used in the elds of transplantation and autoimmunity. Consequences of poor assay choice, poor assay performance, or misinterpretation of data can be severe. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the various immune monitoring assays? Participation in the prociency panel programs allows benchmarking, and enables testing of your lab's prociency in performing the assay. Furthermore, some reagents are better than others. The higher avidity of MHC dextramer reagents, as opposed to conventional multimers such as tetramers, enables more efcient detection of antigen-specic T cells. This workshop will provide examples from cancer immunotherapy, CMV immune monitoring, as well as provide results of previous prociency panels. The data demonstrates that cellular immune monitoring assays are now standard, robust, and routine.Simplied Cellular Analysis of Routine Immunology Applications Using the Muse\u00ae Cell Analyzer 1:15 PM - esenters: Ph.D., Senior R&D Manager The Muse\u00ae cell analyzer is an innovative, highly compact, affordable cell analyzer that enables users of all expertise levels to access flow cytometry data easily. This workshop will focus on a range of research applications of value to the immunologist, including the easy enumeration of PBMC or whole-blood samples, determination of their viability/apoptotic status, and study of proliferation status based on Ki67 expression. Rapid assays that allow for the quick identication and enumeration of CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, or B cells in whole blood or PBMC samples and assays that allow for the study of lymphocyte activation status based on CD69 or CD25 expression levels will also be discussed. The simple, dynamic interface of the Muse\u00ae cell analyzer, coupled with specic assays for whole blood or PBMC samples, makes the platform a valuable tool in immunology research.

Phenotypic and Functional Characterization of Chemokine Receptors on Cancer Cell Lines Using Novel Antibodies 1:15 PM - 2:15 PM EXHIBITOR WORKSHOP ROOM 2 BioLegend\u00ae Presenters: Kelly Lundsten, Business Segment Manager, Advanced Cytometry BioLegend has generated a large library of high-afnity antibody clones against chemokine receptors. Not only is the ability to phenotype receptors important, but the blocking activity of these antibodies would be useful for in vitro studies, as well as having potential in therapeutics. The BioLegend library consists of antibodies against CCR, CXCR, and CX3CR chemokine receptor families. In this application, we screened chemokine receptor expression on 10 different human cancer cell lines. We then designed chemotaxis experiments to assess the potential blocking activity of these anti-chemokine receptor antibodies against appropriate chemokine ligands. Here, we report on unique BioLegend clones with chemotaxis blocking capacity. MONDAY, MAY 5 High Content Cell Surface Receptor Screening Methods and Applications 11:15 AM - 12:15 PM EXHIBITOR WORKSHOP ROOM 1 BioLegend\u00ae Presenters: Zach Bjornson, Graduate Student, Nolan Lab, Stanford University School of Medicine Ken Lau, Ph.D., Technical Marketing Scientist, BioLegend Our lab has applied LEGENDScreen kits in multicolor flow cytometry screening assays to identify unique markers of new cell populations, characterize and compare staining distributions between species and individuals, and study tolerance of antibody clones to different staining protocols. Additionally, by miniaturizing the protocol from 96- to 384-well plates, we have substantially reduced the number of cells and amount of materials required, allowing a scan of approximately 320 antibodies in less than two hours.54 AAI Newsletter M arch-April MEMBERS University of Connecticut Health Center Bianca L.

AAI congratulates the awardees as well as AAI member organizers of the conferences. New England Immunology Conference (NEIC) The 39th Annual NEIC was held November 2-3, 2013, at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The conference was organized by Mark Exley (AAI '02), J. Rodrigo Shannon Turley (AAI '05). For the third year, AAI sponsored awards given at the conference. AAI Young Investigator Awards were presented to four post-doc and student winners: Alexandre Massachusetts; and Francois Legoux (AAI '12), Massachusetts General Hospital. Also sponsored by AAI were two Janeway Awards, named in honor of the late Charles A. Janeway (AAI '74), AAI president from 1997 to 1998. These were won by Sarah Whelan, Trinity College Dublin, and Pablo Romagnoli (AAI '07), University of Connecticut Health Center. The broad-ranging program included sessions on lymphocyte biology at the intersection of autoimmunity, immunity, and tolerance; twenty-rst century vaccines; and mucosal immunity and tolerance\u2014the last dedicated to the memory of past NEIC organizer and AAI member Leo Lefran\u00e7ois.Autumn Immunology Conference (AIC) Nearly 600 scientists attended the 42nd Annual AIC, held November 22-25, 2013, in Chicago. Conference Chair Maria-Luisa Alegre (AAI '97) welcomed attendees on the opening night and introduced Keynote Speaker and Past AAI President Laurie H. Glimcher (AAI '83). Among Glimcher's career accomplishments, which Alegre highlighted, was the AAI Excellence in Mentoring Award in 2008. In the keynote address, Glimcher spoke on \"The ER stress sensor XBP1 in disease.\" AAI, for the third year, sponsored 21 awards in support of talented trainees. Presenting the awards were Alegre, assisted by Virginia Shapiro (AAI '04), AIC awards coordinator. Recipients of the AAI Young Investigator Award were William Bowen (AAI and Jilu Zhang (AAI '13). AAI also continued its sponsorship of the Careers in Immunology Workshop for Undergraduates, directed this year by Heather A. Bruns (AAI '05), who has served as a panelist for the session in past years. This annual workshop provides an opportunity for undergraduate students with a demonstrated interest in immunology to learn about options for research careers in the eld. The panel this year featured Calvin B. Williams (AAI '01) from the Medical College of Wisconsin, John R. Hackett (AAI '94) from AAI Outreach Program AAI Again Extends Support to Early-Career Scientists at New England and Autumn Immunology Conferences Mark Exley (far left) Pablo Romagnoliwww.aai.org 61 Abbott Laboratories, Charlotte M. Vines (AAI '05) from the University of Kansas Medical Center, and Aldo Vacaflores Salinas (AAI '14), a graduate student at the University of Iowa. In this interactive session, the panelists elded a range of questions, from the most important criteria in choosing a graduate school to whether joint M.D.-Ph.D. programs are required training for physician scientists. The workshop was followed by a meet-and-greet session for graduate program representatives to provide students with additional information about the eld and answer questions about their own institutions and programs. The AIC continued its commitment to career development through its workshop blocks and the AIC John Wallace Diversity Program. The workshop blocks give all presenters the opportunity to speak, providing a valuable training experience for students. The annual Wallace luncheon provides the opportunity for present Wallace scholars to meet one-on-one with AIC councillors, past Wallace scholars, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases representatives to hear about their scientic career experiences and receive advice on a range of career issues, including research-funding opportunities. AAI staff hosted a booth in the exhibit and poster hall. There, Jennifer Woods, membership manager, and Mary Litzinger (AAI '11), manager of educational and career development programs, engaged AIC attendees in discussion about the benets and resources available through AAI. Next Issue: Recent AAI Outreach Program support extended to the December \"CRWAD\" and January \"Asilomar\" meetings. Look for coverage in the May-June AAI Newsletter.

Th is crucial step depends on cytosolic DNA sensors (CDSs), which, upon activation, trigger the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and the induction of IFN-responsive genes and proinflammatory chemokines. InvivoGen has developed innovative tools in order to facilitate the study of CDS.Keeping a watchful eye on cytosolic DNA.
