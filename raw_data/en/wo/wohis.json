We will \"warm-up\" with a poem, a (short) short story or article. Or, we might begin by talking about a personal experience. Then, we will write about what we just discussed or about our medical experiences, our patients, our work-induced emotional life, and more. The topic range is broad indeed, and the choices will be up to us all. We will then read and discuss the rich details of our writing with each other in a safe, non-judgmental setting. Medical students and physicians are traditionally taught the need to be emotionally detached from patients - Osler called it \"aequanimitas.\" The reasons for this include protecting ourselves from being overwhelmed by patient suffering and protecting patients from physician loss of \"objectivity.\" The soundness of this rationale has been questioned; but, it is widely held. Regardless, being emotionally detached does not mean devoid of emotion. In preparation for, during, and after clinical encounters with patients, many feelings - both \"positive\" and \"negative\" - naturally arise in medical students. These have to do with seeing, touching, and learning from patients, and from making or the fear of making mistakes. (Nor are seasoned physicians immune to these feelings.) What is a medical student/physician to do with his or her emotions? Many learn to \"stuff\" them, ignore them; some doctors do get good at denial. Would it not be better, at least some of the time, to acknowledge them, give them breathing room, think about them, even discuss them? This is a primary goal of the class. In addition, we will consider the value of regarding the medical history as a \"text\" which can be written and read from differing, equally valid points of view. To this end we may rewrite our traditional medical histories from the non-biomedical perspective of our patients or their loved ones, then compare and contrast the versions. Beyond all this, we will write to explore any issue of importance to us. And, of course, we may write just for the sheer enjoyment of it. Course Requirements: To take the class for credit (one unit, pass/not pass or for a grade) requires attendance/participation at all meetings and writing at home each week. If a class must be missed, extra writing will be expected. Death, Dying, and Modern Medicine: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives History C191; Health and Medical Sciences C133; UGIS C133 Fall 2013 (to be offerred again in Spring 2015) Syllabus Thomas W. Laqueur 3221 Dwinelle Guy Micco 537 University Julia Wambach, GSI Jenni Allen, GSR This course is jointly offered by a physician and a historian. We will discuss contemporary questions of policy and practice: medical definitions of death; the \"right to die;\" how we die and how (we say) we want to die; the role of the hospital and the hospice; the functions of the State in mediating between various views about the end of life; the role of doctors, family, and others at the end of life, for example. We will also consider questions in the social and cultural history of death: how and in what numbers people have died before and after the demographic revolution; whether some cultures were more successful in assuaging the pain of death than others, whether there really has been a secularization of death; where bodies have gone and how they have been remembered; what the relationship is between the history of life and of death. One of the instructors, Guy Micco, MD, is a hospice/palliative care physician, was chair of the Alta Bates ethics committee for many years and regularly teaches medical humanities as well as clinical courses in the UC Berkeley-UCSF Joint Medical Program. The other instructor, Thomas Laqueur, has taught about the history of the body in various contexts and is completing a book on the history of death called The Work of the Dead.

Without it we are nothing,\" -Eric Kandel, Nobel laureate Memory is thought by some (with John Locke) to be a sine qua non of the self; lose it and autonomous agency and personhood are lost. Today, the neurosciences are suggesting something similar: dementia (aka \"major neurocognitive disorder\") is the progressive loss of neurons and their function; with this loss comes loss of memory and, hence, loss of the self and personhood. When personhood is lost, all is lost. Others believe that the \"self\" is relational and that dementia may be perceived (and treated) in a more benign fashion. This course will help students and faculty from diverse backgrounds explore these vastly different views from a number of perspectives across the sciences and humanities. In class, we will engage invited guests with expertise in religious studies, anthropology, history, geriatrics, social welfare, English literature, and the neurosciences. Readings and in-class discussion will be supplemented by fieldwork meant to expose students to programs that employ novel communication and therapeutic methods for elders with serious memory loss. Students will be able to pair with such elders, and perhaps their caregivers, to learn directly about their lives and elicit their psychosocial histories. Another potential fieldwork experience - patient encounters in the geriatric clinic and/or the newly proposed interdisciplinary memory clinic at Alameda County Medical Center (Highland Hospital) - would allow for student learning of how to assess cognitive function. Course Goals and Objectives: 1. Explore various understandings of the 'self' from biological, psychological, religious, historical, social and cultural points-of-view 2. Consider what it is to be a 'person,' and how memory plays into our conceptions of the 'self' 3. Consider whether memory loss as we age is pathological 4. Consider whether memory loss in dementia means loss of the 'self' and one's personhood 5. Experiential component - have first-hand experience with someone labeled as having a dementia and their caregivers Class Requirements and Expectations 1. All students are expected to come to each class prepared to discuss the readings of the week. In preparation for these discussions, two students each week will submit a brief reflection on these readings. These reflections are to be uploaded to bspace and emailed to our course listserv <theself@berkeley.edu> by the day before class, latest. An optional email conversation may or may not transpire. 2. Students are expected to complete at least 15 hours of fieldwork. An orientation to each potential fieldwork site will occur during the first class meeting. Each student will choose their top three site choices by week two of class (February 4), and assignments will be made based on this information. Fieldwork activities could include pairing with a client or resident with memory loss, spending time with them and their caregivers; shadowing staff members as they interact with clients/residents; and sitting in on group interactions/activities and interprofessional team meetings, if/when possible. 3. Each student will give a brief presentation at the end of the semester on his/her fieldwork experience. To facilitate this, students may wish to journal about these experiences. 4. Student will submit a final 8-10 page paper on a topic of their choice related to the subjects of the course - memory, aging, the self. This paper will be due by no later than the last class of the semester. If a class must be missed, Guy Micco should be contacted as soon as possible. A make-up assignment will be given; this will likely be an extended (3-4 page) reflection on the week's readings.

Live performances help bring new interpretations and new meanings to the written word. Readers' theater is a technique used in the performance of literature in which texts are staged with minimal production values and scripts are not fully memorized. Plays are not the only form of literature that can be \"performed.\" Poems and short stories, even novels and memoirs (and many other forms of fiction and nonfiction) have been successfully adapted for the stage. With Readers' Theater, rehearsal and preparation time are significantly reduced so that non-professional performers, who cannot commit to the six to eight weeks of nightly rehearsal traditionally necessary for a fully staged production, can participate; and, performances can be made available to communities with fewer resources. In this course, we will choose stories, plays, and poems that have to do with aging and old age; we hope they will deal with the pleasures as well as the problems and concerns brought to us by aging in our society. We anticipate a lively intergenerational and interdisciplinary dialogue among UC Berkeley students in healthcare professions, humanities, and social sciences, and a group of elders at Salem Lutheran Home, a continuing care retirement community in Oakland. Our course will begin on the Berkeley campus, but many of the class meetings will be at Salem Lutheran with interested elders who reside there. To spark discussion, we will engage in a variety of theater and intergenerational role-playing activities in which the topics will pertain to old age and aging. We will also practice dramatic exercises and techniques that focus on voice, body and presentation; and, for those who are interested, there may be opportunities to visit and participate in Linda Spector's \"Imagination Workshop\" at a skilled nursing elder care community (see below). We will have the time to prepare and perform only a few texts; though we will read and discuss many others together. At the end of the course, we will all 'perform' together at Salem Lutheran and on the Berkeley campus, for a wider audience from both sites. After each performance, we will engage in a discussion with our audience. This is perhaps the richest aspect of Readers' Theater. We look forward to an exciting and fun class! Small print: Some of our rehearsals, performances and/or after-show discussions may be recorded (audio and/or video) to be used later as teaching tools. A dvd comprised of a performance and comments by members of a former class and audience is available for your viewing pleasure. Course Objectives By the end of this course, students will: have discussed and learned from examples of the vast literature (poetry, novels, plays, essays, stories, myths) devoted to aging and end-of-life matters in various societies. have successfully performed (with the Readers' Theater technique) several types of \"aging\" literature before audiences of elders and of their (student) peers. have practiced and employed presentational skills such as vocal expression and proper posture while performing. better understand the relationship between old and young in our time and place and how that relationship is changing as we are living longer. begin to recognize the contributions of wisdom and experience that older people make to all societies. have learned more on how to communicate with elders in a positive and relaxed manner. understand how theater may be used to provoke action, changes in relationships, and comprehension of ideas. understand the potential of dramatic improvisation to enhance communication and comprehension of ideas. Course Requirements: 1. Attend and participate in all class meetings. Assignments, including readings and writing, are to be completed prior to each class. If a class must be missed, a 3-page paper, discussing the reading for the week, or another topic agreed upon with instructors, will be due the following week. (This will be in addition to any written assignment for the week.) 2. The first 15 (or so) minutes of most classes will be reserved for a student presentation on our topic (\"aging\"!). This could be a poem, story, or essay; a film clip, a newspaper or magazine article, a cartoon, TV program, internet site, or personal experience (or other). 3. Participate in the two Readers' Theater presentations near the end of course - one at Salem Lutheran Home, the other at UC Berkeley (These will occur on October 31 and November 7, during usual class time. Readings: some will be posted on the course's bspace site, others will be brought to class by instructors and students. COURSE SYLLABUS 1.

The Death Course: Suffering, Old Age, Death, and Medicine Spring 2009 Guy Micco, MD This all speaks to a major change of attitudes in our culture. The course we are about to take reflects this change; it will give us the time and place to think critically about what is going on. In so doing we will look at current and past representations of death, we will consider such questions as what constitutes a 'good death' and what makes a hospital death problematic. We will spend time discussing death in and through medical literature, fiction and poetry; visual representations and music. And, if you are willing, we will share personal stories of loss. All of this is a reflection of the notion that the better we know ourselves, specifically our attitudes concerning death and dying, the better we will be able to understand and help others - and ourselves - in times of crisis surrounding the death of a patient or loved one. Course Requirements: Weekly readings and discussions based on these readings. In addition, each student will be expected to write a one-half to one-page *reflection* on each week's reading - or some personal reflection on suffering/death stimulated by the reading - prior to that week's class time. This will be collected each week. (Note that a *reflection* is not meant to be a polished piece of writing; rather, it may be written within 10 to 15 minutes of concentrated effort.) The first 20 to 30 minutes of each class will be devoted to a student presentation/ discussion of a short reading - from any source - on our topic. (Three possible sources, Kitchen Table Wisdom, How Can I Help?, and The Oxford Book of Death, are listed below.) For a letter grade there will be a 10-15 page paper or a class-related project approved by course instructor due by the last day of class. Any student who so desires will be paired with a hospital chaplaincy resident, and provisions will be made for visiting patients in the hospital together. The time commitment to, and depth of, this experience is left to each student. The Retreat: On the weekend of April 10-12, a two-day retreat will be held at Green Gulch Zen Center, beginning with dinner Friday evening, ending with lunch on Sunday. We will engage in discussions and practices designed to give us a more keen awareness of our sense of life and death and how we deal with our own and others' suffering and mortality. The goal is to provide a structured opportunity to explore, integrate, and deepen individual learning from the class. Attendance cannot be mandatory but is strongly requested. _____________ Look Look me in the eye - Most of I mean all of - Why make such a fuss Are going to - I mean Look me in the eye. -Rick Fields SCHEDULE Note: All classes will be held on Wednesdays from 5:30-7:30PM (or 6 to 8:00) in 104 Dwinelle The retreat will be the weekend of April 10-12 January 21 Introduction - discuss themes, writing exercise, part of Marin Monsen's film January 28 What is Death?
