Children bring the virus home from school, infect one member of the family who infects the next, and before long the entire family has had an attack of the seasonal flu. The disease generally runs its course uninterrupted for five to seven days, and even with medications only gets slightly less virulent. Even though the seasonal cold and cough are barely harmful in the long run, it does account for a major loss of work and productivity. This is because even something as seemingly trivial as a blocked nose can in fact be a great discomfort that brings down energy levels significantly. People with poor immune systems are readily influenced by these seasonal viruses. Sudden change in temperature is the most commonly met causative factor. Perhaps coming home from the outside heat you switched on the fan to the maximum setting, or drank cold water right after coming from the sun. Or it could be that you enjoyed ice cream on a very hot day, or took a cold bath right after coming home from playing sports. There can be many other examples. When the immunity is weak the body is unable to adapt to these sudden changes in temperature and becomes susceptible to infections. As we are aware these infections are highly contagious and spread rapidly. School children are especially notorious for carrying these infections at home. If one child in the class gets infected the entire class becomes prone to the illness. [Cold and cough](https://www.schwabeindia.com/product-category/diseases/respiratory-diseases/cough/) that occurs with changing season show some typical signs and symptoms. Often the symptoms begin with sneezing or a stitch in the throat. This is followed by a running nose which is initially watery but may become thick once the bacterial infection gets superadded. The sneezes are violent and frequent and may feel like scraping the throat. The nose becomes blocked and this is worse at night when the person lies down. This makes sleep very difficult. Pain in the throat is also seen. This pain very commonly also travels to one or both ears which make the person very uncomfortable. If the illness is particularly virulent fever may also appear. Chilliness and shivering are also frequently seen. Headache, nausea and malaise are common. With these symptoms, there is a general sense of weakness, fatigue and lack of energy. It is therefore not surprising that both the amount and quality of work done by a person suffering from the seasonal cold and cough are affected adversely. It is important to build up our immunity, and it is important to start as early as possible. The major portion of building up our immunity is the dietary factor. What we eat and how we eat both impacts our health, and one cannot develop strong immunity based on unhealthy food. A diet rich in proteins, vitamins and minerals is absolutely essential. Eggs and milk must be a part of daily routine to build strong immunity. Also, green vegetables and fruits are irreplaceable. Apples, oranges, broccoli, spinach, nuts, basil, honey, ginger and garlic, and even fruits like amla are all important additions to make in the diet. Also, one must not forget the part played by something so basic: water. Water sustains us, our life as well as our bodies. Proper intake of water is an absolute must.
