University of California San Francisco Six health care experts grapple with how to address race without being racist. UCSF researchers have created a CRISPR technique to study how turning on or off single genes affects the function of different cell types and how these changes play a role in disease. New research by UCSF scientists shows retinal scans can detect key changes in blood vessels that may provide an early sign of Alzheimer's disease. Researchers at UCSF have observed a new feature of neural activity in the hippocampus - the brain's memory hub - that may explain how this vital brain region combines a diverse range of inputs into a multi-layered memories that can later be recalled. Scientists at UCSF are learning how immune cells naturally clear the body of defunct - or senescent - cells that contribute to aging and many chronic diseases Pioneering neural recordings in patients with Parkinson's disease by UCSF scientists are providing the groundwork for personalized brain stimulation to treat Parkinson's and other neurological disorders. Games and supplements claim to strengthen memory and cognition. Should you buy them? Researchers at UCSF have demonstrated how to engineer smart immune cells that are effective against solid tumors, opening the door to treating a variety of cancers that have long been untouchable with immunotherapies. Three faculty members from UCSFhave been elected to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), one of the highest honors accorded to American scientists. While researchers are still striving to understand why some patients experience these \"long-haul\" symptoms, two UCSF clinicians from complimentary specialties have teamed up to create an integrative medicine skills program that can give such patients better tools to cope with the debilitating symptoms. A large study of brain MRI scans from 11,679 children between the ages of 9 and 10 reviewed by UC San Francisco neuroradiologists identified potentially life-threatening conditions in 1 in 500 Scientists at UCSF's Neuroscape brain research center have developed a first-of-its-kind virtual reality video game that can improve memory in healthy, older adults. Researchers at UCSF have confirmed that a different, long under-studied type of brain cell - astrocytes, named for their star-like shape - can influence how long and how deeply animals sleep. A new study led by UC San Francisco finds that young adulthood may be the most critical period to practice the healthy lifestyle habits that may protect the brain from cognitive decline decades later. We asked UCSF infectious disease expert Monica Gandhi, MD, MPH, to unpack some of the big questions around vaccine science, such as how the Johnson & Johnson vaccine differs, how well it works against the new variants, and whether you should be worried about transmitting the virus after vaccination. The Global Brain Health Institute (GBHI) is delighted to present \"UnRavelled,\" a new drama by award-winning playwright Jake Broder, which explores the relationship between art, music and brain health. This will be one of the first and largest studies to examine the impact of factors like age and stress on vaccination effectiveness. UCSF and UC Berkeley today announced a long-term research partnership with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, and its parent company, Roche Holding AG, to speed the development of new therapeutics for debilitating brain diseases and disorders of the central nervous system. In a new study, UCSF and Stanford researchers have identified a central switch that appears to control when neural progenitor cells stop multiplying and start differentiating into mature neurons. UCSF scientists have formed a research alliance with pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly and Company aimed at better understanding autoimmune diseases and fostering the development of new therapies Millie Hughes-Fulford, a UCSF scientist who flew in June 1991 aboard the first space shuttle mission dedicated to biomedical studies, died on Feb. 2 at the age of 75. S A new study finds that inherited genetic variation plays a role in who is likely to benefit from checkpoint inhibitors, which release the immune system's brakes so it can attack cancer. "}
