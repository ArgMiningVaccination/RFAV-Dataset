Brucella abortus (B. abortus) primarily affects bovine species; however, goats, sheep, and horses are also susceptible. B. suis primarily affects porcine species; and a third strain, B. melitensis, primarily affects goats and sheep. A fourth strain, B. ovis, which primarily affects sheep, exists in the United States but it does not cause significant disease problems. Currently, there is no program or initiative to establish a program for the control of B. ovis or B. melitensis. In its principal animal hosts, brucellosis causes loss of young through spontaneous abortion or birth of weak offspring, reduced milk production, and infertility. It can affect both animals and humans. Brucellosis is transmitted from animals by direct contact with infected blood, placentas, fetuses, or uterine secretions, or through the consumption of infected and raw animal products (especially milk and milk products). There is no economically feasible treatment for brucellosis in livestock. The regulations of the APHIS Brucellosis Eradication Program vary based on the brucellosis status of each State. Minimum standards are set forth in the [Brucellosis Eradication Uniform Methods and Rules](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/brucellosis/downloads/umr_bovine_bruc.pdf), a publication distributed by VS; however, some States have more restrictive requirements. Check with the appropriate [APHIS Veterinary Services (VS) Area Offices](/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/contact-us/sa_area_offices/vs-area-offices) for testing and vaccination policies. Contact the [State or Federal animal health officials in your State](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/vet_accreditation/downloads/state-animal-health-officials.pdf) to obtain all necessary forms, mailers, identification tags, and other items required for both vaccinating and testing eligible animals. (Fees may apply.) Before testing for interstate shipment, obtain State-specific regulations by contacting the [State animal health official's office](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/vet_accreditation/downloads/state-animal-health-officials.pdf) in the importing State. When preparing to test and certify an animal for international export, follow the requirements found in the [National Center for Import and Export, Animal Regulations Library](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/importexport) and then contact the [APHIS VS Area Offices](/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/contact-us/sa_area_offices/vs-area-offices) for additional guidance. [VS Form 4-33, Brucellosis Test Record](/library/forms/pdf/VS_4_33.pdf) (and, if applicable, a [VS Form 4-33A, Continuation Sheet](/library/forms/pdf/VS_4_33A.pdf)) must be completed for each animal or herd tested. (A separate VS Form 4-33 must also be completed for each species tested). (See [Appendix D](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/vet_accreditation/downloads/appendix-d-forms.pdf) for an example of this form and instructions for completing it). The VS Form 4-33 requires that a reason be provided for conducting the test. Reasons may include export (specify the test required by the importing country), interstate movement (depends on the destination State), sale (including local change of ownership in many States), show or fair, diagnostic assessment (such as abortion), and owner request. If infection is suspected or confirmed, regulatory officials will contact you, the owner, or both, to develop a herd plan. [VS Form 4-54, Brucellosis Test Record - Market Cattle Testing Program](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/library/forms/pdf/VS_Form4_54.pdf), is used for brucellosis tests conducted as part of the Market Cattle Testing Program. This program governs the testing of cattle and bison at markets (first point of concentration) or slaughter. (See [Appendix D](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/vet_accreditation/downloads/appendix-d-forms.pdf) for an example of this form and instructions for completing it.) Bovine\u2014 A complete herd blood test must include all cattle or bison six months of age and older, except steers and spayed heifers, unless otherwise specified by a Designated Epidemiologist. Swine\u2014A complete herd test must include all breeding swine more than six months of age unless they are being fed for slaughter and are not in contact with breeding swine. Vietnamese potbellied pigs are considered domestic swine for the purposes of disease control and eradication procedures and, as such, fall under the same regulations in Title 9 of the CFR. All tested swine must be identified with an official eartag, tattoo, or other official identification. (Also see the APHIS Animal Disease Traceability guidance \" [Official Eartags: General Criteria and Options](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/traceability/downloads/ADT_eartags_criteria.pdf).\") Exotic Species\u2014When dealing with exotic or non-domestic species, contact your [State animal health official](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/vet_accreditation/downloads/state-animal-health-officials.pdf) or the appropriate [APHIS VS Area Offices](/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/contact-us/sa_area_offices/vs-area-offices). Identify each animal with either an official USDA metal eartag (placed in the upper middle portion of the right ear), an official USDA RFID eartag (placed in the middle of the left ear), an individual animal's breed registration tattoo or brand, or an individual registration number (in conjunction with an official eartag, or breed registration tattoo or brand) issued by a breed association recognized by VS. (Also see the APHIS Animal Disease Traceability guidance \" [Official Eartags: General Criteria and Options](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/traceability/downloads/ADT_eartags_criteria.pdf).\") Record the information from the identification or vaccination eartag, the registration tattoo, and the age (months or years), sex, and breed for each animal on VS Form 4-33. Take proper precautions by wearing protective gloves and eyewear when in contact with animals being tested. Avoid direct contact with any retained placenta, vaginal discharges, aborted fetuses, and other reproductive tissues, as these materials are potential sources of transmission of brucellosis. Note: If the animal has an approved official identification tag (e.g., NUES, RFID, etc.) in place, record the information from that eartag on the VS Form 4-33, and do not place a new official USDA metal or RFID eartag in the ear. Collect 3 to 5 mL of blood. Take appropriate precautions to prevent hemolysis by (1) sending the samples with ice packs or (2) centrifuging the blood and sending the serum only. (See \" [Laboratory Submissions](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/nvap/NVAP-Reference-Guide/Laboratory-Submissions).\") Because swine blood is particularly susceptible to hemolysis, take extra precautions in handling it. If bleeding the animal with a needle and syringe, do not extrude the sampled blood from the syringe through the needle into the test tube. This practice can cause hemolysis. Blood or serum samples should be delivered to the appropriate cooperative State or Federal laboratory as soon as possible for testing. Test results will be interpreted by State or Federal regulatory officials. You may be contacted for additional individual animal or herd history. Heifer calves should be vaccinated between four and 12 months of age; however, many States have more restrictive age requirements for vaccination. Before vaccinating any animals for brucellosis, be certain that you understand and follow the applicable State's requirements. Adult vaccination for brucellosis may only be conducted by State and/or Federal officials. If you have questions concerning this program, contact the appropriate [State animal health official](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/vet_accreditation/downloads/state-animal-health-officials.pdf) or [APHIS VS Area Offices.](/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/contact-us/sa_area_offices/vs-area-offices) Step 1: Vaccine Handling and Administration Step 2: Tattooing Example of an RB51 vaccination tattoo applied in the right ear Step 3: Records The details of eradicating brucellosis from herds known to be infected are beyond the scope of this guidance. Your State animal health official, the APHIS VS Area Offices for your State, and your local regulatory veterinarian will work with you and your client to develop a herd plan. "}
