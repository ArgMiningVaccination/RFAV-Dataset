In 2006, Monmouth's Department ofSurgery has added another impressive achievementto its long list of minimally invasive firsts, as the hos- pital became the first and only hospital in the region to offer the da Vinci S Surgical System\u2014a sophisti-cated robotic platform that combines computer androbotic technologies with the surgeon's skills to over-come the limitations of traditional surgery . (See story on page 38.) Robotic technology's entry into the operating room represents the latest advance in minimally invasive surgery, with patient benefits that includeless scarring , pain, blood loss and infection risk; a shorter hospital stay; reduced recovery time; and better clinical results when compared with tradition- al open surgery. The robot does not replace the surgeon, but instead translates the surgeon's hand movementsinto precise micromovements of the system's slender instruments, placed inside the body. Because it is not a true self -performing robot, da V inci cannot mak e decisions on its own, and will not move the surgical instruments or perform any type of movement with- out the surgeon 's direct input. The system is named after artist Leonardo da Vinci, who is often credited with inventing the firstrobot and who created artistic masterpieces withgreat anatomical accuracy and detail. ForMonmouth Medical Center, the da Vinci system has painted a picture of surgical precision and a future where an ever-widening population of patients\u2014 even those undergoing the most complex proce- dures\u2014will be able to benefit from the advan-tages of minimally inva-sive surgery.ROBOTICS' ADVANTAGE Sincerely , FRANK J. V OZOS , M.D., FACS Executive Director Monmouth Medical Center A 28 / November 2006Whatever you do, don't call it renovation. Thework on old houses thatphilanthropists MorganCline and Ben D'Onofriohave done together fordecades now is restoration , they insist\u2014it's predicatedon respect for things asthey once were, not an urge to update them. Their collaboration began years ago in Hobo - ken, where despite very different successful careers they found a common interest in bringing old brownstones back to life. \"W e would leave our jobs at the end of the day, put on dirty old dun - garees, and do painting,plastering and floor sand-ing,\" says D'Onofrio, 79. \"W e looked at it as fun, not as work.\" Still, the duo's activity was a business partner - ship, not just a hobby. They bought, restored and sold old homes, ultimately rehabilitating more than 200 urban buildings, then moving on to country estates, including mansions in R umson and Middletown. And some of the proceeds yielded by their love of the past now help to provide a better future for others. Neither man look ed lik e philanthropist mater - ial early on. D'Onofrio was the youngest in a Staten Island family of nine children. His father died when he was 13, and he and his siblings took jobs to help their mother make ends meet. He was entranced bythe waterfront, where cargo ships dock ed. \"I knew I wanted to get into the transportation and shipping industry ,\" he says. So he studied traffic and trans- portation in school, then work ed for steamship lines to learn the ropes. He went on to become CEO of three shipping and warehousing corporations. Cline, 75, grew up on a farm near the fading mining town of Exline in one of Iowa 's poorest coun- ties. \" We each had one pair of shoes\u2014and none inthe summer\u2014but we had a good time,\" he remem-bers. \"W didn't know we were poor, because every-one was.\" Valedictorian of his high school says,\"because there were onlyseven kids\"), Cline earned a pharmacy degree and took two years of medicalschool. But he felt cre - atively unfulfilled, so he got a job in the pharma- ceutical advertising field \u2014and found his niche. He went on to start an ad agency and producegroundbreaking direct-to-consumer advertising . These days, age and health concerns have slowed the two men up a bit\u2014they do a lot lesshands-on work in dungarees. (\"Our minds are stillracing at a hundred miles an hour , but our bodies can't keep up,\" Cline says.) But they've turned the same creativity that has long mark ed their many restoration projects to the task of charitable giving\u2014 especially to health care institutions and facilities for the elderly, both here and in Cline's native Iowa. Cline tak es a particular interest in the care of Alzheimer 's disease, which claimed his father 's life. And because many of D'Onofrio's family members were lost to cancer , he is especially active in raising funds for cancer treatment and research. T ogether the two men host the American Cancer Society's annual ball (see page 18). And this June, having been impressed by the treatment they've both received for various health problems at Monmouth MedicalCenter , they made a joint donation of $3 million to the hospital to benefit its emergency services. \"We've work ed hard, but the fates have also been kind to us,\" says Cline. \"Now we've reached an age where we want to share what we've made, and wewant to enjoy seeing it used.\" MPRO FILE this pair's philanthropy draws on a shared love of the pastby Barbara Franzese CronCHRISTOPHER BARTH PARTNERS IN GIVING Ben D'Onofrio, left, and Mor gan Cline MONMOUTH health &life / 31 JULIETTE BORDACARE Remember the old chart that showed the basic food groups as a pyramid, with the bottomreflecting what you were supposed to eat mostof? W ell, it's been revamped. Last year, theU.S. Department of Agriculture issued thefirst new version since 1992, giving the familiar icon a new look. The horizontal bars have been replaced by vertical stripes forfive main categories\u2014grains,vegetables, fruits, milk and meat-and-beans\u2014plus a thin yellow stripe repre-senting fats and oils.Not just cosmetic,the change reflects new diet recom - mendations. \"The new version dispenses with the suggest- ed numbers of servings,\" says Laura T addeo, assistant food service director at Monmouth Medical Center. \"Instead, it provides a basis for an individualized approach to diet planning based on each person's needs. There is a place in your diet for all kinds of foods, but balance, moderation and an emphasis on low-fat options and exercise are going to assure the best outcome.\" The pyramid has become the core of an inter - active W eb presentation at www.mypyramid.gov. Thesite lets users enter their age, gender and daily e xer- cise time to obtain dietary guidelines designed for them. And a feature called \"My Pyramid T racker\"offers an analysis of both your food intak e and your physical activity when you type in more detailed information about yourself . Instead of numbers of servings, the guidelines accompanying the new food pyramid define total daily allowances in ounces for grains, meat and beans; cups for fruits, vegetables and dairy products; and teaspoons for oils and fats. Serving sizes are given on the website and the widely distributed poster. The idea is that portion control is just as important as theselection of the proper foods.Another new twist: On the poster and website, the pyramid is accompanied by an image of stairs and a climbing human figure, a reminder that good health requires regu- lar exercise as well as a sound diet. The food pyramid and its \"My Pyramid\" website don't make the process of choosing the right foods automatic\u2014it still tak es some thought. \"Everyone's looking for a quick fix, but there isn't one,\" says T addeo. \"Still, the pyramid is an e xcellent tool that can help you come up with your own dietary goals and accomplish them.\" Mby Phyllis Maguire Better 6ways to make good health easier The Department of Agriculture suggests these tips for integrating healthy habits into your routine: 1.Make sure at least half the grains you eat\u2014in breads, pasta, cereals and rice\u2014are whole-grain products.(They're identified on the label.) 2.Choose whole or cut-up fruit instead of juice. The additional fiber will make you feel more full. 3. Remember that not all fats are equally bad. For the first time, the pyramid distinguishes between solid fats(such as butter and lard, which are heavy on saturatedfats and trans fat) and healthier fat-containing oils suchas canola oil and corn oil. 4.Choose lean meat cuts, and remove the skin from chicken before eating. 5.Vary your protein choices by eating more fish\u2014especially fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such assalmon, herring or trout\u2014and mak - ing more main dishes out of beans or peas instead of animal proteins. 6.Make exercise fun by varying your physical activities and work- ing out with friends. Keep runningshoes in your car or at the office.Walk more, drive less!EATING RIGHT, 2006 the familiar food pyramid gets a 21st-century makeover eliminates plaque, re- taining it inside acatheter tube. \"The length and narrowness of the guide wire and the precision of the blade make it possi-ble to treat longer , more severe blockages than angioplasty can treat,\" Dr. Haser explains. After the proce- dure, the patient is ableto return home withinhours. Meanwhile, the excised plaque is made available to researchers testing the effectiveness of new drugs for fighting chol - esterol. \"It's an advance on two levels\u2014for treatment and for research and development,\" says Dr . Haser . The Silverhawk plaque e xcision procedure is now being used at Monmouth as an alternative to arterial bypass surgery , which involves long incisions and hospital stays of two to four days. W ith Silver - hawk, patients are back on their feet the same day and resume normal activities within a week . \"They are very grateful,\" says Dr. Haser. Since the Silverhawk procedure was intro - duced at Monmouth a little more than a year ago, its success rate has been 80 percent. Success in this case means the artery remains open after one year , pain and numbness are alleviated and the patient is able to walk again. Those who stay on the follow-up program,which involves reduced dietary fat and daily moderate exercise, can expect to stay healthy, says Dr. Haser. MLinkHEALTH For some seniors, a sim- ple evening stroll on the boardwalk can be daunt-ing. They have peri- pheral artery disease(PAD), a variant of \"hardening of the arter- ies\" that is marked by leg pain and numbness that can mak e walking diffi - cult and uncomfortable. Not long ago, this condition kept people on the sidelines of life, with little but aspirin toease the pain. T reat-ment, when possible,often meant an open operation, typically with long leg incisions and a substantial recovery period after major surgery. When these methods failed, amputa-tion of a foot was often necessary to eliminate painand prevent gangrene. Now there's a better option: the Silverhawk system for arterial plaque excision. With it, says Paul Haser , M.D., Monmouth Medical Center's assistant program director of general surgery , \"patients feel they've gotten their lives back. And the beauty is that it 's a same -day procedure.\" Silverhawk removes plaque from blocked arter- ies with a 12-millimeter blade that works inside the artery . \"In laymen 's terms, I suppose you could call it a Roto-Rooter system,\" says Dr. Haser. The tiny, high- speed rotating blade is placed at the end of a wire, which is inserted in the groin via a needle. The blade is then advanced through the blockage, shavingplaque off the artery walls.

There are two types of strokes: ischemic andhemorrhagic. Eighty-five percent of all strokes are ischemic ones, in which oxygen is cut off from the brain because of a blockage caused by a blood clotthat has either built up on the wall of a brain artery(thrombosis) or traveled into the artery from anotherplace in the body (embolism). In hemorrhagicstrokes, the remaining 15 percent, a ruptured arterycauses bleeding in the brain, damaging brain tissue. Timing of diagnosis is crucial for an ischemic stroke, because the clot-busting drug tissue plasmino- gen activator (tPA) must be given within three hoursBRAI NHEAL TH minutes count in tr eating str oke A clot-busting dr ug can be a lifesaver when this serious condition strikes To find out more about treatment for stroke at Monmouth Medical Center, call 732-923-6635.continued of the onset of symptoms to be effective. When tPA is given, it can restore blood flow to the brain andsometimes prevent permanent damage. Patients whoare diagnosed with hemorrhagic stroke are quicklyevaluated by a neurosurgeon to assess whether surgery would be effective. Monmouth's stroke team has instituted proto- cols to prescribe each step of stroke care to speed theevaluation of patients with symptoms. These \"order steps\" cover the emergency room assessment and physical exam, blood tests, blood pressure check, com-puted tomography (CT) scan read by a neuroradiolo-gist, electrocardiogram (EKG) and finally a diagnosis. \"By expediting the diagnostic workup using American Stroke Association guidelines, we optimizecare with the goal of improving the outcome dramat- ically ,\" says Martin Herman, M .D., section chief of neurology , who heads the strok e team. If an ischemic stroke is diagnosed and the patient is given tPA, he or she is hospitalized for 24hours in the medical center 's intensive care unit and then moved to the designated strok e inpatient unit. If the three -hour tP A window has passed or the patient cannot tolerate the drug for medical reasons, aspirin or other antithrombolytic medications may be given. Patients are hospitalized in the strok e unit. (Those who e xperience transient ischemic attacks, or TIAs \u2014\"mini strokes\" that can be a precursor to a stroke\u2014 are observed in the medical center's short-stay unit.) \"Throughout the ne xt few days, every patient is assessed for rehabilitation therapy , smoking cessa - tion, nutrition services, social services and the pre- vention of heart disease and diabetes,\" e xplains nurse Shirley Hwang , administrative director of neuro- science services at Monmouth Medical Center. All these disciplines mak e up the strok e team, along with emergency medicine physicians, neurolo- gists, an advanced practice nurse coordinator, on-callneurosurgeons, radiologists, registered nurses andtrained ancillary staff . All nurses who staff the inpa - tient strok e unit must undergo at least eight hours of continuing education every year . Community outreach is a final component of Monmouth Medical Center's comprehensive stroke services. Earlier this fall, the strok e team presented an educational seminar for the Holmdel F irst Aid Squad's emergency medical services personnel. Strok e prevention is a frequent topic of talks deliv - ered by the medical center's health educators to senior groups and civic organizations. It 's all part of the hospital's aggressive efforts to ensure optimal response to an emergency condition in which timecan mak e all the difference. MConsult your doctor to see if ther e ar e steps you could take to r educe your risk of stroke\u2014for exam- ple, getting more exercise, eating healthier, starting dailyaspirin therapy or making other changes. Be extra vigilant if you belong to one of these thr ee gr oups, which have been linked in studies this year to a higher -than-average stroke risk: Seniors with a history of untreated severe sleep apnea, a dis- order in which breathing is briefly interrupted many times during the night. In a study , Spanish r esear chers found that older people with sever e apnea were two-and-a-half times more likely to suf fer stroke than others.

People with mildly impaired heart function. A study pub- lished in the American Hear t Association jour nal Strokesays individuals with the slight heart impairment known as left ventricular dysfunction (L VD) have a \"significantly incr eased risk of stroke.\" LVD, which has no symptoms, can be identi- fied with echocar diography, a test that uses soundwave tech- nology to test hear t function, and is thought to be pr esent in from 3 percent to 6 percent of the population. 3 groups with a higher risk of stroke JERRY CASIANOcontinuedLinkHEALTH Forget Rosie from The Jetsons and Star Wars' C-3PO. The robot that occupies an operating room atMonmouth Medical Center doesn't wave its arms or move around by itself. But it does function as a surgi-cal tool that can overcome some of the natural limi- tations of even the steadiest human hands. Of course, the robotic da V inci S Surgical Sys- tem, the newest technology employed by Monmouthsurgeons, isn't a substitute for surgeons' skills, but a new tool these physicians use in applying them. The center is the first and only hospital in Monmouth and Ocean counties to acquire a da Vinci, which is namedfor Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci, who designed \u2014and is thought to have built\u2014the world's first robot. Surgeons use the da V inci S Surgical System's computerized robotic technology to provide patients with a safer, gentler, more precise approach to manytypes of surgery , including hysterectomy , prostatec- tomy and lung biopsy . a natural evolution of laparoscopic surgery , which\u2014because it is performed through very small incisions\u2014offers patients reduced risk, faster recovery and the poten- tial for successful repeat operations. The robotic system cannot be programmed or maneuvered without the surgeon 's hands. When using da Vinci, the surgeon sits at a console in the operating room a few feet away from the patient. Inside the console, he or she views a magnified three - dimensional image of the surgical field that is sent by a tiny camera inside the patient. The surgeon slips hisor her hand into instrument controls resembling joy - sticks below the image display. These instrument con- trols move special robotic instruments that have been placed inside the patient through several very small incisions. The surgeon can even manipulate therobotic \"arms\" to move the camera without having torely on another person in the OR. \"Da Vinci enables us to operate more accurately because the system eliminates the slight movements that a surgeon's hand can make, and it offers us supe- rior visualization and improved de xterity ,\" explains Robert A. Graebe, M.D., chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Monmouth Medical Center, who was part of a medical team that helped bring da Vinci to the hospital in June. \"Da Vinci makes it easier for sur- geons to place sutures and connect tissue at difficult angles that would be impossible using standard laparoscopic surgery. In addition to routine surgeries,we can use the da V inci to perform more comple x procedures with less blood loss, fewer complications, less pain, fewer infections and a quicker recovery.\" Robotic surgery also gives doctors more options for patients who cannot tolerate traditional surgerycan technology improve on a surgeon's hands?

Potential future uses include urogynecologic procedures to treat incontinence andcomplex gynecologic surgeries to treat ovarian anduterine cancers. Mbecause of fragile overall health.

LinkHEALTH continued Cervical cancer claims the lives of 3,700 American women each year, but they don't need to die. The dis-ease is preventable. Cancer of the cervix\u2014the narrow, lower part of a woman's uterus\u2014has been declining for yearsthanks to widespread use of the P ap smear , a screen - ing test that is performed in a doctor 's office during a pelvic exam. In this broadly recommended test, cells taken from the cervix are smeared on a glass slide and examined under a microscope for abnormalities. But P ap smears aren 't perfect. Their effective - ness depends on the doctor 's getting a good sample and correctly interpreting changes within cells. A recent study in the International Journal of Cancer showed that these cell changes can be detected more clearly by testing the cellsfor the human papillo-mavirus (HPV), a commonsexually transmitted virus that has been link ed to gen- ital warts and an increased risk of cervical cancer . Use of the HPV test may soon become standardpractice. And the availabilityof widespread HPV testingcould mak e insurance com - panies less apt to cover Pap smears for certain women\u2014for e xample, those with a negative HPV test and a previous normal Pap. Some doctors now believe that a woman of any age shouldbe aware of her HPV status, so that if it 's positive she can be followed more carefully\u2014perhaps with Pap smears every six months rather than annually .

It blocks infection by the two strains of HPV virusthat cause 70 percent of cervical cancer cases and the two strains responsible for 90 percent of genitalwarts. Priced at $120 a shot and given in three shots over six months, it's only a preventive and does not cure these conditions. personal takeIf a woman's Pap smear shows precancerous or cancerous cells that may need treatment, these further procedures may be suggested: Colposcopy: Often in a doctor's office, a colposcope (a device with a bright light and a magnifying lens) is used to examine cer vical tissue. Biopsy: Tissue is removed, often in a doctor's office under local anesthesia, so a pathologist can examine it. T ypes include the punch biopsy, in which a sharp, hollow device pinches off tissuesamples; endocer vical cur ettage, in which a spoon-shaped instr u- ment or a br ush is used to scrape of f tissue fr om the cer vical canal; and LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure), in which an elec- tric wir e loop slices off a thin, round piece of tissue. A conization, or cone biopsy , in which a cone-shaped tissue sample is taken to see if abnormal cells lie below the surface, requires general anesthesia. Source: National Cancer Institute continued If you're an employer in Monmouth County and sur- rounding areas\u2014or have one\u2014you should know about Monmouth Medical Center's OccupationalHealth Department. \"Occupational health is a branch of medicine that focuses on the health and wellness ofemployees in the workplace,\" explains Joyce Jenkins, one of the unit's two full-time nurse practitioners.\"Its primary purpose is to protect employees andmaintain a safe work environment.\" The department, open weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., provides a variety of services both toMonmouth's many departments and to private com-panies that have contracts with the hospital. Says Jenkins: \"W e seek to keep employees safe and to limit employers' liability for workers' compensation claims.\" Businesses are required to have a workers' compensation policy, which covers needed treatment. If a workplace injury occurs, the Occu pational Health Department evaluates and treats the injured work er. But companies also request services such as pre - placement examinations, educational sessions, vacci- nation programs, risk analyses and annual physicals. \"About 50 percent of our contracted work involves pre-employment physical examinations,\"says Jenkins. Such an exam on an individual offeredemployment as a security officer, for example, must include a check to make sure the person is physicallyfit not just for the hours of watching required, but also for the occasional emergency that might demand a quick and agile physical response. The departmentmakes a recommendation, but it's the employer'sresponsibility to mak e final hiring decisions. Occupational Health also offers consultations on workplace health and safety\u2014for example, helping people avoid repetitive -motion injuries. In addition, it provides adult vaccinations, which now include immunizations required for international travel. \"Some occupational health units are free- standing facilities,\" says Jenkins. \"W e feel it's a big advantage that we're on the premises of MonmouthMedical Center, able to perform X-rays, CT [computed tomography] scans and MRIs [magnetic resonance imaging studies] on site.
