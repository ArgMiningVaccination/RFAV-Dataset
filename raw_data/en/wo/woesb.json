But when it reaches its lowest point, the spirit will begin to rise up again and out of this new spirit there will be not just a red Indian but a white, black, and yellow. The beginning of this new rising will be signified by the Eagle landing on the moon.\" in 1969, when Neil armstrong landed on the moon, his first words were, \"the eagle has landed.\" the spirit has been rising ever since. the First Nations Health authority's vision of holistic wellness is a part of that rising, and there is an opportunity for everyone today to play a significant role in the rising of the new spirit. The Rising Of The Spirit leonard George, Tsleil-Waututh Nation, First Nations Health Authority Elder AdvisorChange is Possible... Promoting health careers to the next generation of skilled First Nations students is a responsibility i hold near and dear to my heart. i remember starting my career in the health field over 30 years ago, almost by chance. it wasn't something i originally planned on undertaking. i had seen my mother supporting our community from when i was a young girl, and i witnessed the impact her kindness and unwavering commitment had on changing the lives of those she served. My mother knew we needed to return to our traditions to take care of our people the right way, and this is a lesson i still carry with me today. as First Nations people, we know we must have direct control over the programs and services that improve our health. My job as a Community Health director allows me to be a resource for change and to share my knowledge on how best to improve services and community wellness. this is not an easy task as we continue along our journey of transforming First Nations health in bC, but i take comfort in knowing we are inspiring students to get involved and build an even better health system for the future. What i have learned over my career is that change is possible if you have a clear picture of where you need to go, combined with the courage to take the first step. Help to keep the momentum going and carefully consider the health careers described in this guidebook. sharing your skills with your community when you complete your education is a rewarding, wonderful way to honour your people, your family and most importantly, yourself.Foreword there are Countless opportunities... today in bC, First Nations have a tremendous opportunity: we can take a lead role in the design and delivery of health services for our communities. We can be part of transforming our health system, creating a holistic approach to health that will keep people well. i entered medical school at ubC after completing my bachelor of science, which meant i was able to have the support of my home community of stz'uminus on Vancouver island, and the supports for aboriginal students at ubC. i completed the First Nations family practice program, and went to Vancouver island to work near my home community. it was an honor to work as a family physician with my community but i got frustrated with seeing people most often after they were already sick instead of being able to help people stay well. so i went back to school and completed a residency in Public Health and Preventive medicine. this has enabled me to be very involved in the creation of the First Nations Health authority. i would have never dreamed about the opportunity to be involved in such transformational work, and we need many more people to help us in this journey! in the years ahead, there will be countless opportunities for First Nations health professionals to make meaningful contributions to their communities, whether they choose to work in primary care, health promotion, or traditional practices. We are uniquely positioned to develop a blended health model combining western medicine and traditional wisdom. restoring health to our communities is everyone's responsibility, and everyone can play an important role in the process. Choosing a career in health helps build a brighter future for all First Nations and aboriginal people in bC.Jacki McPhersonPresident, Okanagan Nation, First Nations Health Directors AssociationDr. Shannon tania Waters, First Nation Stz'uminusDirector, Health Surveillance and Program Evaluation, First Nations Health AuthorityvFirst NatioNs HealtH autHority HealtH Careers Guidebook Introduction Today, health is everywhere you look. You'll find it on your grocery shelves, on TV, and in magazines and newspapers. It's a hot topic all over the internet, in your school, in your community, and everywhere we work and play. The focus on health has never been more significant. and for many of us, health no longer means simply a state of physical well-being. We are looking at health more holistically \u2014 acknowledging and valuing that it encompasses mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects as well. More and more, health care providers are starting to work together as teams to help people to maintain and improve their overall well-being. as the field of health continues to grow and change, now is an exciting time to begin your career in this dynamic and innovative area. it also happens to be the perfect opportunity for young, passionate, and educated bC First Nations and aboriginal youth. Here are five great reasons to consider starting your career in health: 1. you'll Change lives Working in the health field gives you the unique opportunity to make positive changes in the lives of others. there's no other career path that can give you the ability to save, change, and improve lives from birth to death (and everywhere in between). No matter what area of health you choose to focus in, whether it's dental care, vision care, information technology, public health, or policy and administration, you'll know that you're making a real contribution to people's wellbeing. and you'll work with others who share your passion to help people. 2. you'll Find Diversity, variety and opportunity Want to pursue a Phd? or are you looking for a job that you can start right out of high school? Hundreds of different jobs in the health field means that there are opportunities for everyone, regardless of their level of education, or their particular skills and interests. do you enjoy working with the public? or maybe you'd be more interested working in a laboratory setting, or with computers? Whether your ideal job involves working with children, using technology, Cody Caruso, Health Careers Coordinator, First Nations Health AuthorityviFirst NatioNs HealtH autHority HealtH Careers Guidebookspending time outdoors, or crunching numbers, there's a career in health to match your expectations. the field of health is so diverse, and there are lots of opportunities for growth and change throughout your career. you may choose to stay in the same job for three months, three years or for three decades \u2014 the choice is yours! 3. it's Growing... and Fast Here in bC, as in the rest of Canada, the population is aging. baby boomers are starting to retire \u2014 creating job openings \u2014 and they're also needing and using more health services \u2014 creating increased demand. and as people are living longer than ever before, that demand will only continue to grow. Meanwhile, we have a baby boom of our own happening! our aboriginal and First Nations population is the fastest growing demographic in the province, and with an average age in the mid-20s, our communities are growing by leaps and bounds. it all means there's no better time than right now for aboriginal and bC First Nations youth to find their way into a meaningful career within the health field. We need you! 4. You'll Enjoy Competitive Pay and Benefits Many of the opportunities within the health field in our province offer excellent pay along with medical, dental and extended health care benefits. these employers may also offer opportunities for professional development and progressive pay scales for continued service, as well as attractive pension plans. Health professionals who decide to enter private practice or who find employment with businesses or non-profit organizations will have more variable earnings, but with the high demand for many types of health professionals, wages are expected to remain very competitive across the field. 5. your Community Needs you if you're not already convinced that health is the right path for you, consider this: you can make a real, lasting contribution to the well-being of the people in your local community through your health career. For many First Nations and aboriginal youth who come from rural or remote communities, health care is a great way to give back to their home community. there's a shortage of health care workers in many areas of the province, and there's a shortage of First Nations and aboriginal health providers. you can change that. as our understanding of the holistic nature of health increases, we're realizing the importance of culture, language, and traditional foods and medicines. aboriginal health providers bring a cultural understanding to their work in their communities that can't be duplicated. aboriginal youth bring gifts, skills, and abilities that are in high demand in our communities, Nations, and the province. of course there are other incentives for working in rural and remote communities, including bC student loan Forgiveness programs and other financial benefits. Not to mention there is also a tremendous amount of value in working in close-knit communities and building lasting relationships with the people you work with and for. Choose a Health Career today as a First Nations or aboriginal person, you've got a tremendous opportunity to build an exciting career in the health field. your skills and education are highly sought after. so take the time to consider your options and choose a career path that fits your abilities and interests. as you read about the careers profiled in this guide, remember that the field of health is constantly changing: new jobs are emerging, new skills are always needed.

This group of diverse medical and health care practices are not generally considered part of conventional Western medicine. Alternative and complementary health practitioners take a holistic approach to patient care; they view and treat the patient as a whole person, rather than focusing on particular symptoms. This field of health tends to be strongly prevention-oriented, utilizing low-tech, \"hands-on\" techniques that are intended to strengthen the body's natural ability to heal itself.

When i decided to enter the Midwifery profession i was already enrolled in a ba program at McMaster university. i applied for admission to the ryerson university Midwifery education Programme. i had to go back and take a high school biology class in summer school, which felt a bit silly at the time, but was well worth it. i never dreamed in high school that i was going to go into the health sciences! i love what i do. it's this amazing privilege we have as midwives, to be invited into the most intimate and important time in a family's life. it's so neat to watch the family evolve over time, and i am happy to be carrying on a tradition. i believe being treated respectfully and gently during this time and welcoming that baby in a good way is important for the health of the whole community, young and old. Midwives look after women in pregnancy, during the labour and birth, and during the first six weeks after the baby is born. so my day usually involves a combination of prenatal visits, maybe a birth, and some mom and baby care. i do visits in a clinic and in home, and i also work at the hospital. i volunteer at the elementary school and i often participate in prenatal groups or i may go speak to a youth group. i would love to see each community being served by midwives from their own community, and to make Midwifery education and training closer to home for everyone. i would love if the whole lifecycle of care were available to our communities, so everyone could be supported by loved ones during birth, and also at the end of life. too many families are separated at these important times. it is my goal to help our communities get there.My storyEvelyn Harney Anishinaabe First Nation Registered Midwife Mental Health, Addictions & Community Services Did you know that in any given year, as many as one in five people may experience a mental health or addiction problem?
