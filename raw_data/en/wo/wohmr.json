These procedures include those where the worker's gloved hands may be in contact with sharp instruments, needle tips or sharp tissues (spicules of bone or teeth) inside a patient's open body cavity, wound or confined anatomical space where the hands or fingertips may not be completely visible at all times. e.g. dental work, surgical procedures]. AACP does not view acupuncture as constituting an EPP, however, contact with body or blood fluids may take place. Department of Health Guidelines require that practitioners provide evidence to their NHS trust of their Hepatitis -B surface antigen [HbsAg] status before undertaking such work. Those with HbsAg, but no eantigen in their blood are required to undergo quantitative Hepatitis -B virus DNA testing by a designated laboratory. NHS Staff with Hepatitis -B e antigen in their blood, are not permitted to perform exposure prone procedures [EPP]. The Department of Health [DOH] Guidelines are in situto safeguard practitioners and patients. In view of these Guidelines, it is clear that AACP procedures should reflect similar standards to maintain \"best practice.\" With forthcoming statutory regulation of the Acupuncture professio n it has become imperative that all AACP members maintain the required standards of practice to ensure protection of themselves and patients. AACP therefore recommend the following: 1.All AACP members should now seek Hepatitis -B vaccine, administered intram uscularly at 0, 1 and 6 months, unless they already have evidence of up to date vaccination. 2.Immunity should be checked [anti-HBs] two months after the third dose. The result should be recorded and the practitioner should retain an up-to-date vaccination card. If a good response a.In the case of iu > 100 Units anti-HBs, a single booster dose should be given after 5 years. b.Pre booster testing of anti-HBs is not recommendedc.Post booster testing is only required in individuals who have never demonstrated an adequate response (>100iu). d.Subsequent doses of vaccine need only be offered if indicated following a needle stick injury. If a poor response a.In the case of iu >10 but < 100 units, anti-HBs a fourth dose of vaccination is administered and immunity checked 1 month later. b.If the response remains poor after the second course, the vaccinee is probably immune. c.If high-risk exposure, vaccine will be required. If susceptible a.In the case of iu < 10 units anti-HBs the anticore status should be screened for evidence of past HBV infection. b.If anti-core antibody is not detected, a repeat full course of vaccine should be undertaken. All those identified, as true non-responders should be advised to obtain Hepatitis -B specific immunoglobulin. c.If anti-core positive further tests will be required to ensure that the vaccinee is not an HBV carrier. If significant illness develops after the second or subsequent doses of Hepatitis -B vaccine, this should be reported to the Committee on Safety of Medicines and no further doses should be given. AACP recommends that all Acupuncture practitioners undertake the above simple precaution.
