As of November 2, the Pfizer vaccine has received EUA from the FDA and approval from the CDC to vaccinate kids 5-11 years old. At this point, everyone 5+ years old in Aroma Park are eligible for the COVID vaccine. The CDC recommends everyone ages 5 and older get a COVID-19 vaccine to help protect against COVID-19. Vaccines for children under 5 years old are still awaiting results of clinical trials and approval from the FDA. Research shows these COVID vaccines are remarkably effective and safe. The American Academy of Pediatrics urges children and adults to get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as they can. Once the FDA provides emergency use authorization (EUA) for the vaccines to be administered to children, it is likely that the same providers in Aroma Park that are currently administering the vaccine to adults will begin accepting appointments for kids. Independent pharmacies, as well as regional and national chains, are administering the COVID vaccine across the country. Most are partnered with HHS directly to make the vaccine available as quickly as possible. Here are a few of the major pharmacy chains administering the vaccine with details on how to register for an appointment: The first two COVID vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna each require two (2) doses of the COVID vaccine. Each dose must be of the same product, and will need to be separated by either 21 days or 28 days, depending on the vaccine. That means if you received your first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, your second dose must also be the Pfizer vaccine. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine, approved for use in the US on February 27, 2021, only requires one dose. Consult your healthcare professional if you have additional questions. In most cases, COVID-19 testing and antibody testing is available at no out of pocket cost if you are covered by commercial insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid. You will likely have to pay a normal office visit copay, however. For cash paying patients, the two largest labs have reported that the Medicare rates (likely the lowest cost) to process an antibody test is around $50 and $100-$200 for a PCR swab test. It is important to understand that many healthcare providers are requiring screenings prior to testing, which may or may not be covered by your insurance, and may or may not require additional copays. After immunization, the body normally takes a few weeks to develop immunity (protection against the virus that causes COVID-19). That means a person could become infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 before or after vaccination and still become unwell. This is due to the vaccine's inability to provide protection due to a lack of time. Vaccines against COVID-19 are both safe and effective. Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines, which have been subjected to the most stringent safety testing in the country's history. You should acquire a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you are eligible, according to the CDC. While the ability to transmit COVID-19 is possible after you have been fully vaccinated, experts believe it will happen at a slower rate given the efficacy of the vaccine. It's most like only relevant for people who don't have a good immunological response to immunizations in general. According to the CDC, as of October 21, 2021, individuals who received a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the following groups are eligible for a booster shot at 6 months or more after their initial series: (1) 65 years and older, (2) Age 18+ who live in long-term care settings, (3) Age 18+ who have underlying medical conditions, and (4) Age 18+ who work or live in high-risk settings. For the nearly 15 million people who got the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, booster shots are also recommended for those who are 18 and older and who were vaccinated two or more months ago. - Verified patient on 1/26 - Verified patient on 4/7 - Verified patient on 5/30 - Verified patient on 9/18 - Verified patient on 12/5 - Verified patient on 12/17 - Verified patient on 11/19 - Verified patient on 3/9 - Verified patient on 12/4 - Verified patient on 2/7 - Verified patient on 11/24 - Verified patient on 4/7 - Verified patient on 9/10 - Verified patient on 2/23 - Verified patient on 3/14 - Verified patient on 2/21 - Verified patient on 4/13 - Verified patient on 5/15 - Verified patient on 3/11 - Verified patient on 2/6 There are currently 3 COVID vaccine available in Orlando and throughout the country: Pfizer-BioNTech (mRNA), Moderna (mRNA Vaccines), and Johnson & Johnson (Vector vaccine). As of April 7, 2021, three vaccines, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna, have been approved for use via an emergency use authorization (EAU) for adults ages 16 and older. Pfizer has since received EUA for 5-11 year olds, opening the door for everyone in the country 5 years and older to receiving a COVID vaccine. Getting a COVID vaccine will be similar to the process of getting any other type of vaccine. Patients should talk to their doctors about whether they have allergies and if they have ever experienced a reaction or specific side effects from a vaccine in the past. They should also inform their doctors whether they are currently ill, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant. The injection itself usually only takes a few seconds and may feel like a slight pinch on the skin. Most people do not experience serious side effects from vaccines, and any side effects they do experience are usually mild. Chills, low-grade fever, headache, tiredness, and muscle and joint aches are the most common side effects of vaccines. People who get a mRNA COVID vaccine will need another booster shot roughly 3-4 weeks after the first shot to stay protected from COVID-19, while the Johnson & Johnson vaccine only requires one shot. It is not yet known how long immunity to COVID-19 will last after receiving a COVID vaccine. Studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccines are safe to get and highly effective at preventing you from getting COVID-19. Even if you do get COVID-19, the vaccine prevents you from getting seriously ill. The more people that get vaccinated, the faster we can get back to normal life. When deciding to get vaccinated, it's important to separate fact from fiction. All vaccines come with potential risks and side effects. The most common side effects associated with vaccines are low-grade fever, malaise, and redness and pain at the injection site. More than 50% of people who received early COVID-19 vaccines reported experiencing mild short-term side effects including fever, headache, muscle aches, and reactions at the injection site.
