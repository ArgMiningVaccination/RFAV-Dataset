SACRED CEREMONIAL TATTOOING Tattoos are powerful rites of passage marking important elements of a person's life. We are taking this ancient sacred practice to the next level in our modern day world. Tattooing is a ritual where an intention is permanently inscribed into the client skin. We use our visionary talent with ceremony to create a powerful shift for our clients through the tattooing process. Getting a sacred tattoo is a unique and personalized experience. First, there is a consultation where the artist and the client work together to develop both the intention and the art for the tattoo process. What does the client wish for this tattoo to bring into their lives? What do they need to release? The tattoo ceremony itself begins with the opening of sacred space. Sacred space helps us step out of ordinary life and into the realm of magic where everything is possible. Optional: We could use something like shamanic rattles to break up your stagnant energy or a sage spray to clear your energy. The creation of space often includes a chakra opening because tattooing works just like acupuncture, but more intensely focused. The more open your energy is, the better it can flow through the tattoo ceremony process and create the change that is desired. We offer crystals (such as rose quartz, smokey quartz, and labradorite) to be held during the tattoo process. We also offer aromatherapy. Our choice is Lavender. It has a wonderful effect on the central nervous system. Lavender aromatherapy is thought to calm anxiety by impacting the limbic system, the part of the brain that controls emotions. It is quite calming. Several of our artists are also Reiki Practitioners. If you choose a Reiki artist, Reiki is available during your session. Reiki calms the client, provides an overall peaceful experience and is even said to decrease pain. Sacred space is ceremonially closed after the work of the tattoo is complete with the use of tingshas or a blessing. With clear energy, the intention has been implanted, and the sacredness is again acknowledged at the end of the working. There is an incredible transformative power that comes with receiving a ceremonial tattoo. In a short time, you are permanently changed for the rest of your life. This is where the magic is, and why tattooing is still practiced today. Ceremonial tattooing creates an altered state and helps you connect with your own inner awareness. This rite gives you confidence and power to live your life differently from that point forward. Our specialties include mandalas, sacred geometry and designs based on runes/numerology. What do you want to create in your life? What if I don't want that? Do you offer normal tattoo sessions as well? -Yes! All artists offer regular tattoo sessions as well. "}
