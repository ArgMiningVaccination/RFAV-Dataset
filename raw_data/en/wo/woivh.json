What the experts say ... \"I love, love, love your magazine.

Thank you. \u2014 Jim Gordon Congratulations Experience Life on 15 years of high quality health journalism!

Conquer Cravings, Retrain Your Fat Cells, and Lose Weight Permanently. EL keeps it real: real health, real people, real value in each issue, and shows readers that health is more than the latest diet or yoga pose; it's a total life experience. EL, also, importantly respects the intelligence of its readers, providing a step above so much of the information we're bombarded with daily, and making it a publication you can trust \u2014 and look forward to reading. I do! \u2014 Aviva Romm, MD (Yale School of Medicine), Author Botanical Medicine for Women's Health, The Natural Pregnancy Book, Naturally Healthy Babies and Children Nice piece (\" [The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/the-monk-who-sold-his-ferrari/)\") by one of my favorite peeps @_Brian_Johnson in one of my favorite mags, @ExperienceLife. @DrFrankLipman (Twitter) Experience Life magazine offers practical insights into the major health challenges that all Americans face. The writing is compelling and the message has impact. Reading the magazine is time well spent. \u2014Mehmet Oz, MD, The Dr. Oz Show Kathlyn and I look forward to every issue of Experience Life. It's a unique blend of right-now wisdom on all the things we're most interested in: well-being, relationships and positive personal change. It's insightful, life-changing and fun to read. \u2014Gay Hendricks, PhD, author of The Big Leap, Five Wishes and Conscious Loving (with Dr. Kathlyn Hendricks) Experience Life magazine's coverage of healthy eating, environmental issues, and wellness topics is not only well-researched and cutting edge, it is accessible enough for the everyday reader. The content is inspiring and empowering; just what busy folks need to start living healthier lives today. \u2014Sara Snow, green living expert, TV host and author of Fresh Living: The Essential Room-by-Room Guide to a Greener, Healthier Family and Home. Experience Life is consistently ahead of the curve in bringing us compelling information on what really works when it comes to living longer, better. While other health magazines were peddling the empty promises of diets and supplements, Experience Life was bringing us cutting-edge reporting on holistic, evidence-based medicine and prevention. If you're interested in adding years to you life and life to your years, there's no better magazine in America. \u2014Dan Buettner, author of The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest Experience Life magazine offers a refreshingly new approach to whole health. The look is sharp, the content is cutting edge, and the articles tell the truth about what it takes to build a great body and a great life. So if you're tired of the same old fads or \"quick fix\" gimmicks that most fitness magazines offer, pick up a copy of Experience Life and see what it takes to create real, long-lasting success! \u2014Cheryl Richardson, New York Times best-selling author of Take Time for Your Life, Life Makeovers and Stand Up for Your Life. Most publications follow trends but Experience Life started one. In a time when other publications are scrambling to reinvent themselves, to offer information on healthy living, the environment and sustainable practices, its no surprise that Experience Life has been offering that from the very beginning. \u2014Nathan Lyon, celebrity chef, health food authority, and star of Discovery Health's A Lyon in the Kitchen Over the past four years, I have become a raving fan of Experience Life because it's the very best magazine of its kind \u2014 honest, authentic, relevant and contemporary. Editor Pilar Gerasimo and her team have raised the bar on health and fitness publications in this country. Period. \u2014Sally Edwards, fitness expert and triathlon legend The folks at Experience Life magazine are on the cutting edge \u2014 not the fringe \u2014 of fitness and nutrition. They know the difference between trends and fads. \u2014Michael Boyle, MEd, CSCS, founder of [www.strengthcoach.com](https://www.strengthcoach.com/) Experience Life approaches food and nutrition topics with passion, intelligence and practicality. You can count on them for well-researched, insightful stories and delicious, healthy recipes that can truly help you live life to the fullest. \u2014Ellie Krieger, RD, bestselling and James Beard Award winning author of The Food You Crave What readers say ... I just received my first issue of Experience Life on a recommendation of a friend. I am hooked! Great, great publication. I thought your article \" [Autism's Puzzle](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/autisms-puzzle/)\" (October 2011) was very well done. \u2014Lisa Imerman, Waterford, Mich. Just sat down to enjoy this month's issue! What a great one (not surprised). I particularly liked the article \" [Don't Delay Your Dreams](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/dont-delay-your-dreams/)\" (November 2011) by Jon Spayde. Being a small business owner who's trying to make my mark, it particularly stood out to me! Thanks for your work! \u2014Hilani Ellis, via Web site comment I seriously love your magazine more than any other magazine I have ever read. It really covers things that matter and are healthy, and there is no fluff and stupid Cosmo-type stuff in it. Please don't ever change that. \u2014April Bjorklund, Minneapolis I love your magazine. It's by far the best of all the mags in my chiropractic office waiting room! It's actually quite shocking to see up-to-date information in a magazine! Thank you! \u2014Carley Fardell, via Web site comment I recently found Experience Life and I am honestly so excited. In the past year, I made a new life choice to change careers and pursue a new path. I have taught Pilates and yoga for a year and have decided that this is the time to pursue it full-time. While at the library recently, I passed by the periodicals and Experience Life caught my eye. Finally \u2014 a magazine that \"speaks to me.\" I have had subscriptions to several other magazines related to fitness and health but never really felt informed and motivated after I finished reading them. Thank you for putting out something with so much useful information, tools and resources. Plus, I have to say that what inspired me the most was the last page with the quote from Henry David Thoreau. At a time in my life where I'm feeling a little lost, it spoke to me. I look forward to the next issue. \u2014Valerie Smaldone, Littleton, Colo. As so many others have done, I too want to thank you for an outstanding magazine. I keep copies in my waiting room (I'm a marriage and family therapist) and I often have clients asking to borrow issues. I have also provided clients with links to articles on your Web site that address issues we are working with. Many of my clients have gone on to subscribe to your magazine. Thank you for your holistic and balanced approach to health \u2014 especially the inclusion of articles on relational health! \u2014Kristin Sliwicki, Lincolnshire, Ill. I'm one more Life Time fan of Pilar Gerasimo's \" [Thoughts From the Editor](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/department/thoughts-from-the-editor/)\" column and of the overall magazine. I realized how important Experience Life is to me when I noted that the reading material I brought along to read in a doctor's waiting room consisted entirely of four back issues of the magazine! \u2014Stanley Rowen, Baltimore I'm a member of Life Time and I'm highly impressed with the club. My overall experience is excellent. I love Experience Life magazine. It is very interesting and has tons of stuff that is useful in day-to-day life. \u2014Shipra Mehta, Eagan, Minn. I just wanted to say thank you for offering the choice with this month's issue to opt out of receiving the magazine. I personally love getting it and look forward to each new issue, but it's nice to try and conserve and give people the choice not to get it. \u2014Michelle Wolfe Cantrell I was surprised to receive the new copy of Experience Life magazine with a card asking me if I want to cancel my print subscription (I am Life Time member). After reading and understanding what you are trying to do (carbon-footprint reduction), I wanted to let you know that I appreciate the approach. I decided, however, not to cancel my print subscription. Your magazine is the only paper magazine I read and find extremely interesting. I did pick up a number of other health magazines over the years but found them to be very superficial, \"go-with-the-crowd\" types of publications. After reading an article in those magazines, I always start wondering about the depth of the research (if any was done) before the author wrote it. With your magazine, I do not feel the same way. So, I say thank you and keep my subscription coming! You will not see the little [opt out] card from me. In fact, after looking at the little \"no-stamp-needed\" return-card, I removed it and tore it up just to make sure I do not put it in the outgoing mail by mistake. Keep up the good work, and thanks again. \u2014Mo Omari, Sterling Heights, Mich. What a wonderful magazine and Web site; thank you! I copied your resiliency article (\" [The 5 Best Ways to Build Resiliency](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/the-5-best-ways-to-build-resiliency/),\" September 2011) for my clients and I to talk about. Becoming resilient isn't hard when one has a positive attitude. \u2014Marilyn Binstock Spenadel Love \u2014Kyla LadyMirage Latrice I'm a new subscriber, and I love the informative articles and tips that are truly practical and about health (rather than appearance) \u2014 unlike so many other magazines. \u2014Wendy Duchene, Pittsburgh Found you in the doctor's office today and loved your articles. =) \u2014Janet Giannoccari Andrews, via Facebook I really enjoy your magazine! Always helpful and useful information! \u2014Fit and Funky, via Facebook I enjoy your magazine immensely. All the articles are related to issues I've been attracted to recently. And I've noticed how you remain open-minded, and let your readers decide. Thanks again for a worthwhile and inspiring magazine that keeps readers focused on what is important in today's lifestyles. \u2014Venessa Rahe, Cincinnati, Ohio Thank you for sending me sample issues of Experience Life magazine! I read my first one over lunch, and really appreciate the excellent information and crisp, clean look of the magazine. I will be jumping on the Web site now \u2014 and then I'll be putting in for a subscription of my own. \u2014Jason Dicken, Iowa City, Iowa I have to tell you that I love, love this magazine. I know lots about fitness, nutrition, lifestyle choices, etc., and I'm an avid reader of quality media like the New York Times, The New Yorker and The Paris Review. I'm also a psychotherapist and a life coach. I say all of that to qualify my praise of your publication: I think that your magazine is, without a doubt, the best health, nutrition, fitness and lifestyle magazine that I have ever read. Thanks, and don't go away. \u2014Kari Moore, City, via email @ExperienceLife LOVE your magazine! Please don't ever change your commitment to true good health w/o all the BS and \"fakery\" of other mags!! \u2014@danceswifhooves, via Twitter Love @ExperienceLife mag plus @RevAct. well-written articles about health and wellness, holistic thinking. Excited when new issue arrives! \u2014@amybpeterson, via Twitter I am so excited \u2014 I just bought a subscription to your magazine! I LOVE this magazine! I should have purchased a subscription long ago, but was just borrowing a friend's for a long time and reading lots of your articles online. Now I will have my very own copies! I just want to say what a great job y'all do and how excited I am to read each new copy of EL! I recommend it to everyone \u2014 coworkers, family, friends \u2014 to help us all live healthier lives. And I'm always sending people links to your Web site. \u2014Meggen Wilburn, via email A colleague brought your magazine to my attention because one of your articles summarized some research I had talked with her about. I have now handed out copies of \" [Food Crazy](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/food-crazy/)\" and \" [Intuitive Eating for Weight Loss](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/intuitive-eating-for-weight-loss/)\" to my patients. I was so enthusiastic about your magazine that I subscribed. Thank you for the good work. \u2014Connie Natvig, PhD, Licensed Clinical Psychologist, Tinley Park, Ill. I received my first Experience Life magazine after signing up for the subscription last month. WOW! I am inspired. It sure does beat the mass-trade media out there. The article on glutathione [\" [Glutathione: The Great Protector](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/glutathione-the-great-protector/),\" April 2011] was fascinating and I loved the takeaways from \" [The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/the-six-pillars-of-self-esteem/)\" [Big Ideas, April 2011]. \u2014Clare Evans, Dove Creek, Colo. I just finished the latest issue of Experience Life and I had to write to you. This magazine is absolutely phenomenal. In fact, it may be the single best publication I have ever read. Each element of well-being, from meditation to exercise, is addressed in a thoughtful, balanced way (not unlike the way it should be in our daily lives). Not only is the content exceptional and an easy read, the layout is beautiful. \u2014Andrea Krakower, via email I recently picked up a copy of Experience Life magazine and I was absolutely bowled over. I guess I was expecting more typical \"lose weight fast,\" \"exercise makes you feel good\" or some such watered-down health-club fare, but instead got an impressive array of interesting, well-written, research-based articles addressing many important current topics. As a licensed marriage and family therapist, lifelong athlete and former coach who also believes health, wellness and movement is a way of being and living, not just something you \"do,\" I am now your magazine's newest fan! \u2014Marta Wilson Christmann, Stillwater, Minn. Your publication is about the best thing out there in print. You take such a balanced, no-nonsense approach to just about everything. I am a holistic health practitioner and natural gourmet chef, and voraciously read everything I can that is mind/body/spirit and food- related. I've learned and applied more from your publication than most of the others combined. \u2014Erin Fight Green, Marietta, Ga. \"Being Healthy is a Revolutionary Act!\" is the tag line of this excellent magazine and in fact it applies very well to the magazine itself. Experience L!fe consistently presents in-depth articles that challenge complacency and conformity. Every issue is packed with articles that are genuinely interesting, relevant and impressively cutting-edge. Looking through the December 2011 issue I found substantive articles on the following subjects: dangers of electromagnetic fields (EMF) and how we can reduce our risk; vitamin D benefits and recommendations; primal fitness - physical training in natural environments and based on our evolutionary genetic roots; functional medicine; mind/body connection in creativity; toxic ingredients in cosmetics.....and more. Disclaimer: I get nothing for recommending this magazine, in fact I'm sure they don't even know I exist. I'm telling you about it because it is the best of its type that I have seen. I think you will get a lot from it. It also would make a great gift. \u2014Avi Khadir Aberman, via email I just finished the latest issue of Experience Life and I had to write to you. This magazine is absolutely phenomenal. In fact, it may be the single best publication I have ever read. Each element of well being, from meditation to exercise, is addressed in a thoughtful, balanced way (not unlike the way it should be in our daily lives). Not only is the content exceptional and an easy read, the layout is beautiful. -Andrea K., via Facebook I LOVE this magazine! I can honestly say I've never read a magazine cover to cover like this one. I find myself flying through each article \u2014 each one just tends to resonate with me, my health and my life right now. I love the conscious living articles, as well as the health, diet and exercise articles, which beautifully blend both traditional, alternative and holistic approaches to attaining a good health and life. THANK YOU for being a unique publication that provides many ideas to improve one's well-being. It's not just a magazine, it's a guide to living a good life! \u2014Jennifer S., Chicago, Ill. I love your magazine! With all the so-called health magazines out there, I believe that your magazine is one of the few truly authentic ones. Keep up the good work! \u2014Toni G., via email Your magazine is probably the best, most informative and motivating health and fitness publication I've ever read. It cuts to the chase instead of using \"filler\" articles to bulk up pages to sell. I'm able to get all I need from one magazine instead of two or three. Thank you! \u2014Cheryl M., via email I find that a majority of fitness magazines miss the mark of both physical and emotional health. Your magazine does a wonderful job of stressing 360 degree health. \u2014Jamy, via email I love receiving, reading and learning from your magazine. I've made changes in my life because of it. Each issue has something to think about, act upon and be challenged by. At almost 57, I, too, have benefited from each issue. The articles have been practical, useful and inspirational. Having nearly died twice \u2014 once from a motorcycle accident, once from non-Hodgkins lymphoma \u2014 I have learned that having a body prepared for the unexpected may keep you alive. Although I am not a specimen of male perfection, my good diet and exercise program probably enabled my body to hang on during both ordeals. \u2014Peter F., via email Thank you for putting out such a great magazine. I used to read Hollywood gossip magazines over breakfast and they would just tear me down and give me a negative image about myself. Ever since I switched to your magazine, I have begun each day on such a lighter note! The articles are full of good things to know, but most importantly they are uplifting and get me motivated to have naturally healthy days. Thank you!! \u2014Nancy A., Fairfax, Va. Nice job. Helpful, thought-provoking and entertaining. I never thought I'd find a \"fitness\" magazine interesting to read. I'm a 49-year-old family man who finally woke up. I've never been physically fit in my whole adult life. Pudgy throughout. Now Experience Life is changing that and I feel great. I'm often told, \"You can't possibly be old enough to have a 21-year-old son!\" It's fun to \"be\" younger. \u2014Dave S., Mound, Minn. I recently received a complimentary issue of Experience Life and think I've found the perfect magazine. It's the best blend of fitness and lifestyle information that I've come across in a long time \u2014 an amalgam of Utne Reader magazine, Fast Food Nation and a fitness magazine all rolled up in one. Thank you! \u2014Kirstin C., via email I just received my fourth issue of Experience Life and I wanted to say thank you. Your magazine has helped me to realize that merely living life is not enough and that experiencing it to the fullest is a whole lot better. I have learned to take everything a day at a time, and I even enjoy exercising now! \u2014Shonta\u00e9 M., Orlando, Fla. What a great magazine! I was an avid reader of Men's Health for years but have switched to Experience Life \u2014 both for the content and the applicability to my family. I like that EL has more wholesome content, more in-depth research and more comprehensive subject-matter expertise. It leaves the reader feeling educated (vs. opined). EL also gravitates toward a broader audience: male/female, younger/older, athletic/intelligent (not that this last pair is mutually exclusive!). Finally, EL's layout is easy to read (spacing, coloration, etc.). Men's Health sometimes tries to place too much data in one issue and that can get a bit overwhelming. It's quality over quantity, in my opinion. You are doing a great job! \u2014Kurt Z., via email I had to write to tell you how much I enjoy your magazine. The amazing thing about this is that you are the only magazine that has ever captured my attention. I have always valued health and exercise, and at age 40, I have gained an interest in a more comprehensive understanding of good food and exercise so I can teach my children to live a healthy life. I even share your articles with others that can appreciate them. Thanks for being able to do what no other magazine has done! \u2014Renee S., Troy, Mich. Your magazine is excellent. It is so refreshing to read articles that are based on modern concerns for health and the world that don't push the latest fad or craze. I appreciate the \"real people, real concerns\" focus you have, and the articles are well researched and give the reader a chance to think for him- or herself, then get into action. Very inspiring! \u2014Katie K., St. Paul, Minn. It is such a pleasure and often an enlightening experience to become absorbed in the quality articles that fill this magazine. For my summer vacation, I packed several back issues that I hadn't had a chance to read cover to cover. The well-researched and inspirational advice was a perfect complement to the crashing ocean waves and truly helped me to restore and renew myself. On the train ride back home, I used many of these concepts to create a blueprint for a more healthy and balanced lifestyle. Thanks for continually working hard to produce this great publication. \u2014Emily M., via email I love your magazine \u2014 I read it cover to cover every time! I am a marathoner as well as a physical therapist, and I feel that your articles are very entertaining, as well as educational. \u2014Lori D., via email I continue to be impressed by your magazine. Not only do you provide depth to your articles, you pick topics that other magazines don't address that get to the core issues of being healthy, fit, happy and confident. I read each issue from cover to cover, and I am amazed how much you look outside the box of conventional thinking and how much your philosophy mirrors my own as a healthy-lifestyle coach. \u2014Alice G., via email You guys do a great job of covering all areas of health and wellness. I'm an Ironman triathlete, so that stuff is important to me. I look forward to every issue. \u2014Scott S., via email A few months ago, my wife picked up a copy of your magazine at a local bookstore. She was looking for a way to relax, get some good health tips, and, most of all, feel like she had a support system via podcasts, blogs and other outreach programs. Well, you certainly fit the bill; my wife was hooked. She asked me to read an article about [Sara Snow](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/a-change-for-the-better/) (Coverage, January/February 2008), and I could not put your magazine down. I now go to the mailbox with anticipation, hoping to get Experience Life before my wife notices. Perhaps I shouldn't give you my real name for fear that my cover will be blown! I just signed up for an additional two years \u2014 for my wife, of course! -Kurt F., via email I don't think I've ever read such a motivational magazine for my age group (over 50 or so). Thanks! \u2014Loraine M., Alberta, Canada I am a high school health teacher and subscribe to your magazine because I appreciate the positive, realistic view of the \"whole life.\" It is so difficult to find a relevant health magazine that is appropriate and healthy for young, developing adults. Experience Life is a breath of fresh air. I am most excited that I recently found a back issue in my kids' bathroom with the pages folded back. You see, my two pre-teen daughters are also reading and benefiting from your professionalism. As a teacher and a dad, I thank you. \u2014Chris F., via email Thank you for publishing such an excellent magazine. One very positive characteristic that I've noted is a holistic approach to life without the materialistic basis. \u2014Debbie A., via email I recently discovered your magazine and Web site, and I'm loving it! Thank you for the wonderful articles and information. I feel like everything I care about is wrapped up into one easy-to-read package. I especially appreciate your focus on green and sustainable living. Thanks, and keep up the good work. \u2014Anne M., via email I wanted to thank you for creating such a wonderful magazine. I have received many, many magazines over the years \u2014 from Organic Gardening to Prevention and so on. Your magazine is the most well written and contains the best articles of any magazine that I have read dealing with personal and health issues. I really enjoy it. \u2014Todd B., via email Wow! I bought your magazine on a whim today, enticed by [Dara Torres](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/in-the-fast-lane/). I thought she was in her 20s ans was wowed when I read the article and found out that she is 41! Go for the gold, Dara! Your magazine is the first magazine I have ever read from cover to cover in one sitting. It has everything I need to help me with my fitness goals and my personal and professional goals. Thanks! \u2014Mary F., via email Outstanding magazine! The information is invaluable to those of us who want to grow strong both mentally and physically. It's packed with common sense, and to me that's what makes a solid foundation for a balanced life: instructive, educational and reliable facts. I'm looking forward to the next issue and beyond. I wish you and your talented staff continued success! \u2014Lori B., via email I was just browsing your site and found your mag's \"digital edition.\" Wow! Finally, online editorial content that presents information as it was meant to be consumed! Extremely progressive! Love it! \u2014Kathy F., via email I'd like to compliment you and your entire staff on your magazine \u2014 it is really outstanding! I find the content to be wonderfully varied, speaking to readers who may be avid athletes to those who are just getting started. Your integration of mind-body concepts has been eye-opening for me and my family, and the layout is attractive and easy to read. Thanks for continually producing a great magazine \u2014 you've done a terrific job. \u2014Cathy S., via email This is my very first letter to a magazine ever. I just want to thank you very much for what you're doing. I've been receiving Experience Life for about three years now, and I read every issue cover to cover. I really, really enjoy it, and I've brought many ideas from it to my life and my family. \u2014Pavlina V., via email I love your magazine. I've been reading a garden variety of health publications for years. Experience Life offers a unique collection of articles that are interesting, informative and have a great way of sparking interest in old and new areas. I even found myself causing a buzz at work about quinoa after reading your article (\" [Quinoa](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/quinoa/),\" March 2008). Keep up the good work! \u2014Suzanne C., via email I picked up your publication for the first time at my hair salon \u2014 what a great magazine! Most magazines that focus on holistic living, while I love them all, don't speak to the average person easing him/herself into a clean living lifestyle. Kudos to you for bridging the gap! \u2014Tonia G., via email Your magazine is the best around! I am like so many other readers who read your issues cover to cover and enjoy aspects of each issue. I especially want to thank you for the noticeable absence of prescription drug advertisements. I don't know if this is a conscious decision or simply a happenstance, but with the overwhelming majority of doctors, public health officials, news media, TV shows, magazines and other advertising sources urging us to consider drug therapies as a requirement, your magazine is a breath of fresh air. Not only do your articles promote healthy alternatives (including the all-important preventative care), but your advertising content seems to support this. What a brave and refreshing choice! \u2014Angela J., Minneapolis, Minn. One year ago I visited my sister. I was feeling lost in my workouts and went with her to Life Time saying, \"Show me what you do.\" After an hour of working out and catching up, I had a new cardio plan that contributed to a new path for my life. As we were sipping a postworkout drink in the cafe, I noticed your magazine; a month later, I had my own subscription, which has pushed me along my journey with ideas for training, eating and achieving goals. In a few months, I lost 10 pounds, became the fittest I've ever been in my 35 years, changed my diet and hired a coach to help me prepare for my first competitive season in beach volleyball! Your articles support our choices to truly experience life with plenty of food for thought as we navigate our own paths. \u2014Sarah D., via email I am just now getting to your November 2007 issue (I got a bit behind last year \u2014 oops), and I just finished reading a letter you printed from a woman who refers to Experience Life as \"a glossy, superficial magazine\" and who ends her comments with \"I am insulted by the patronizing, superior tone of this article, but I have to say it is characteristic of your publication.\" I have been meaning to write to you for some time, but this letter finally pushed me to do it. I don't know why this woman is so angry, but I have to say that I have never found a magazine that is less superficial or patronizing than yours. I used to read other fitness magazines, but I was really tired of all the articles about how exercising will make your sex life better and how you can eat all the crappy food you want as long as you don't go over some ridiculously low \u2014 not to mention unhealthy \u2014 number of calories. When I first stumbled upon your magazine, I was immediately drawn to the cover, which featured a woman who radiated health and beauty (I believe it was the January/February 2006 issue), rather than the typical toothpicky, no-muscle-tone models that are on the front of all the other so-called fitness magazines. I read that first issue from cover to cover, and then I couldn't rest until I figured out how to get a subscription. I have thoroughly enjoyed every issue I have read since (including the article entitled \" [A Better Birth](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/a-better-birth/),\" which this woman seemed so upset by \u2014 it was truly informative and helped me to decide how my children will be born when that time comes for me). I want to say thank you, thank you, thank you, for such an outstanding publication! I think you people are doing a very wonderful thing with this magazine. I have become so much healthier due to the excellent nutrition and fitness articles you write; I have become more aware of environmental issues (more \"green\" if you will); and I am now looking into a major career change from CPA to Life Coach due in part to the inspiration I have received reading your magazine. Once again, thank you so much for all you do! \u2014Melinda B., via email I just finished flipping through the [\"Green\" issue](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/issues/april-2005/) of EL. WOW! I couldn't put the thing down! You have addressed so many of my interests and concerns that I am going to have to take an afternoon off just to read it all. I also discovered what I am, and what most of my family and friends are: [LOHAS-ians](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/article/are-you-living-lohas/). If we can convince people to take better care of themselves and the world around them, perhaps there is hope for us after all. \u2014Katy G., via email I just wanted to let you know that I was blown away by the [January/February 2005](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/issues/january-february-2005/) issue of Experience Life. I read a lot of magazines, and I've never seen one with so much excellent and relevant information in a single issue. The topics were very interesting and go deeper than other publications. I was so impressed that I have shared it with several of my friends, and they were all equally impressed. \u2014Mike G., via email I have to commend you on this magazine. I just got around to reading the [January/February 2004](https://experiencelife.lifetime.life/issues/january-february-2004/) edition and am very impressed with the caliber and range of the articles and authors. I actually read it cover to cover and was able to pull something helpful out of each article. I truly see this as a useful tool to my training program and not just another magazine. Thanks, and keep up the great work! \u2014Malyssa S., Schaumburg, Ill. I am pleased with my membership at Life Time. I think Experience Life is a great asset to the membership. It features great articles about fitness, health, nutrition and things that matter, unlike a lot of wanna-be magazines that have really watered-down material. -Marisol B., via email "}
