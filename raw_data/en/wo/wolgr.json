Many people automatically reach for over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or naproxen sodium to treat pain. For acute pain, people may request prescription painkillers like opioids. While these medications play an important role in offering respite from pain, it's important to use them sparingly. Painkillers can damage your liver and digestive system, and prescription painkillers can cause dependency. Natural pain management helps control pain and reduce the need for painkillers.
