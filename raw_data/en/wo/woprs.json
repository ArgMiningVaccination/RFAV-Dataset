As a synthesis of conventional and complementary treatment options, integrative medicine combines the pathological with the salutogenetic approach of therapy. The aim is to create a holistic system of medicine for the individual. So far, little is known about its role in plastic surgery. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that integrative medicine based on a conventional therapy with additional anthroposophic therapies is very potent and beneficial for plastic surgery patients. Evaluation and consequence of the hypothesis: Additional anthroposophic pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are promising for all areas of plastic surgery. We are convinced that our specific approach will induce further clinical trials to underline its therapeutic potential.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-04-01", "cleaned_text": "While the conventional understanding of medical treatment was predominantly in reacting to pathologic values, modern integrative medicine rather aims at promoting salutogenetic and hygiogenetic health as sources in a proactive manner [ [6](#B6-medicina-57-00326)]. [6](#B6-medicina-57-00326)]. The most widely used approach to complementary medicine can be divided into two subcategories: natural products, as well as mind and body practices and acupuncture [ [7](#B7-medicina-57-00326)]. This includes appropriate therapeutic and lifestyle approaches as well as healthcare professionals and most modern disciplines. [6](#B6-medicina-57-00326)]. The aim is to create a holistic system of medicine for the individual. Precisely this concept addresses the patient's needs and requirements of the present; a period of time in which self-determination and personal responsibility have become more and more important [ [8](#B8-medicina-57-00326)]. [9](#B9-medicina-57-00326)]. In anthroposophic cardiology, for example, the influence of rhythmic massage on heart rate variability has been studied [ [10](#B10-medicina-57-00326)]. [11](#B11-medicina-57-00326)]. For example, Arnica montana, onion extract, Vitamin E products, and Melitolus are considered beneficial [ [11](#B11-medicina-57-00326)]. Mind and body practices, such as hypnosis and meditation, are also known to have a positive effect on the postoperative course of plastic surgery patients [ [11](#B11-medicina-57-00326)]. It should also be mentioned that therapeutic concepts of integrative medicine can be applied in all four pillars of plastic surgery (aesthetic surgery, reconstructive surgery, burns, and hand surgery) [ [2](#B2-medicina-57-00326), [11](#B11-medicina-57-00326), [12](#B12-medicina-57-00326), [13](#B13-medicina-57-00326), [14](#B14-medicina-57-00326)]. However, little is known about the impact of a broader integrative concept that is based on anthroposophic medicine and combines these individual offerings and procedures, as the utilisation of IM in plastic surgery departments seems to be under-frequented [ [2](#B2-medicina-57-00326)]. We aim to share our encouraging first experiences of anthroposophic medicine integrated into standard plastic surgery treatments. 2. Hypothesis [15](#B15-medicina-57-00326)]. The demand of complementary therapy concepts next to conventional medicine leads to a very attractive and healthy environment at the GKH, even for patients with an international background. [15](#B15-medicina-57-00326)]. 3. Evaluation of the Hypotheses [2](#B2-medicina-57-00326), [13](#B13-medicina-57-00326)]. The first publications mentioning plastic surgery in combination with complementary medicine was published in the 1970s [ [16](#B16-medicina-57-00326)]. However, as already reported, the current published data on these aspects are sparse. Still, the positive effects on the emotional state of the patients and the perception and processing of a perioperative and postoperative course are indisputable [ [17](#B17-medicina-57-00326), [18](#B18-medicina-57-00326), [19](#B19-medicina-57-00326)]. Surveys have even shown that patients expect plastic surgeons to be familiar with integrative medicine [ [13](#B13-medicina-57-00326), [20](#B20-medicina-57-00326)]. One of these surveys, by Patel et al., described that 80% of plastic surgery patients received integrative medicine services, such as natural products and mind-body practices. The majority of the questioned patients (71%) strongly believe in self-healing [ [13](#B13-medicina-57-00326)]. This elective surgery population seeks and examines the possibility of complementary treatments [ [21](#B21-medicina-57-00326)]. Patients undergoing aesthetic surgery are reported to have a high incidence of psychosocial issues [ [22](#B22-medicina-57-00326), [23](#B23-medicina-57-00326)]. A department offering a surgical therapy in combination with a holistic approach that stresses the importance of mental wellness is promising. However, so far, no studies have been performed with respect to treatment based on anthroposophic medicine. [24](#B24-medicina-57-00326), [25](#B25-medicina-57-00326), [26](#B26-medicina-57-00326)]. The use of herbals like Gingko caused bleeding in a blepharoplasty patient and a perioperative therapy with acupuncture was associated with a risk of wound-site infections in a lipoplasty patient [ [27](#B27-medicina-57-00326), [28](#B28-medicina-57-00326)]. Taking into account this important information, we believe that all integrative approaches, which have been described so far mainly in aesthetic-surgical patients, can be applied to all areas of plastic surgery [ [11](#B11-medicina-57-00326), [27](#B27-medicina-57-00326)]. [1](#B1-medicina-57-00326), [29](#B29-medicina-57-00326)]. In Germany, a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of women and men aged 18-69 years was conducted, which showed that overall the effectiveness and usefulness of natural therapies was positively evaluated by the majority of the study population and 58% of those surveyed would like to see such therapies prescribed more often [ [30](#B30-medicina-57-00326)]. [31](#B31-medicina-57-00326)]. In pain therapy, complementary, non-pharmacologic approaches show a positive effect and have already begun to replace some of the conventional medication in times of opioid epidemics [ [31](#B31-medicina-57-00326)]. [32](#B32-medicina-57-00326), [33](#B33-medicina-57-00326), the addition of mistletoe (Viscum album) to targeted therapy significantly reduced the probability of adverse-event-induced oncological treatment discontinuation by 70% [ [9](#B9-medicina-57-00326)]. In addition, transcendental meditation can lead to a higher quality of life in older breast cancer patients also suggest the assumption that even in hospitals where IM is offered, it is rarely applied by plastic surgery departments. Because of this, we would like to emphasise our hypothesis that plastic surgery in combination with IM based on anthroposophic medicine is a promising treatment. [43](#B43-medicina-57-00326)]. Optimised health behaviours would have a positive effect on many of these points, as some studies have already shown [ [44](#B44-medicina-57-00326), [45](#B45-medicina-57-00326)]. Therefore, in our hospital we try to support patients in this respect, to give them an impulse or to reinforce them with our holistic offer. [46](#B46-medicina-57-00326), [47](#B47-medicina-57-00326), [48](#B48-medicina-57-00326)]. Expanding the included literature reveals a variety of negative and positive studies related to integrative therapy approaches and the corresponding issues investigated [ [46](#B46-medicina-57-00326), [49](#B49-medicina-57-00326), [50](#B50-medicina-57-00326), [51](#B51-medicina-57-00326), [52](#B52-medicina-57-00326), [53](#B53-medicina-57-00326)]. 4.
