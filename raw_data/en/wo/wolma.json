I obtained my undergraduate degree in biophysics and my PhD in Computational Neuroscience with Frances Skinner at the University of Toronto. My postdoctoral position with Paul Pavlidis at UBC was my entry into my current field of computational biology and high-throughput genomic data analysis. Tell us about your research My research focuses on three topics: gene networks, cell identity, and organismal variability. This roughly charts my academic progression with my oldest work focused on the use of expression data to understand how genes work together. More recently, like many, I have been exploiting the breadth and depth of single cell data to understand cell types. Organismal variability is the most recent topic within my lab, but one I am particularly excited to pursue in Toronto. Broadly, one might think of these three topics as being different levels of organization with gene networks largely defined within cells to help understand organismal variability. Why did you decide to come back to Toronto? On the personal side, I have always wanted to return home (as I still think of Toronto) and COVID-19 only sharpened that desire. On the professional side, as the First Bassingthwaighte Chair in Integrative Physiology, the position really did seem tailor made to my interests with its specific focus within integrative physiology.

After completing my undergraduate study at Wuhan University in China, I pursued PhD training at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, where I was in its neuroscience graduate program and conducted research in the laboratory of Dr. Luis Parada. I then joined the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., to conduct post-doctoral research, under the tutelage of Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch. Tell us about your research. I have always been fascinated by the brain, how it is formed and how it works. For my PhD research, I used animal models to probe normal development and study neural disorders such as Huntington's disease, neurofibromatosis and major depression. I started my post-doctoral research at a time when new technologies such as human pluripotent stem cells, genome editing, and three-dimensional organoid cultures put me in an exciting position to directly study human brain development and diseases in a dish. My research has been on developing and utilizing these new technologies to understand how the human brain is formed, what makes the human brain different from that of the other species, and how disorders such as autism impact its normal development and function. Why did you decide to come to Toronto? SickKids is a natural fit for me right away because of my interest in studying autism and other childhood disorders. From my first visit on, I have been extremely impressed by the outstanding research environment, the quality of science and most importantly the amazing colleagues around SickKids and the greater Toronto research community.

I completed my undergraduate degrees at the Biochemistry and Bioengineering department of the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure Paris-Saclay (ENS) in France. The school is entirely dedicated to training future educators and researchers. The ENS gives students the opportunity to spend a year or two abroad, and I was lucky to have my first research experience in the laboratory of Rudolph Tanzi at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. This is where I cemented my interest in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. I then went to the California Institute of Technology, in Pasadena, California, to pursue my doctorate in neurobiology with a scientific hero of mine, the late Seymour Benzer. Following the advent of induced pluripotent stem cell technology, I headed to the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., for my post-doctoral work in the laboratory of Rudolf Jaenisch. Tell us about your research. My primary interest is the etiology of neural and glial degeneration, particularly when there is an age-related aspect to it. Eventually, all central nervous system diseases manifest themselves outwardly in neuronal dysfunction, and motor, sensory or cognitive deficits for the patient. But we now appreciate how the problem often starts in glia, the non-electrical cells of the brain. Those constitute more than half of the cells of an adult human brain, and they are not merely a structural scaffold, or a set of insulating elements. One subpopulation of glia are cousins of some white blood cells, macrophages: they are known as microglia. We managed to generate these immune cells from patient skin, via pluripotent stem cells, in the dish. Microglia owe their identity to their residence in the brain, and their biology is linked to the surrounding presence of all the other cells of the brain. For that reason, we devised 3D cultures trying to replicate the tissue-like environment, allowing the study of patient microglia as they interact with neurons and other glial cells. These cells are still very mysterious, but circumstancial evidence is mounting about their involvement in a plethora of disorders. We have a functional platform to test how modulation of their activity (be it by mutations, protein aggregates or viruses) intersects with development, maturation, and degeneration of neural networks. Why did you decide to come to Toronto? Living in a new city and a new country is an exciting prospect. The University of Toronto is extremely well respected in the stem cell community, with pioneers ever since James Till and Ernest McCulloch. The Hospital for Sick Children is a powerhouse of research and clinical development in pediatric medicine. I have a particular interest, since my early days working with iPS cells, in a disease called adrenoleukodystrophy, which is a devastating disorder often presenting in childhood. It is also one of the few diseases that is already benefiting from fringe therapies using autologous stem cell transplants and gene therapy combinations. And yet, more needs to be done and understood. Toronto is a perfect place to continue this work, with direct clinical input, and hopefully therapeutic outputs down the line. I felt wonderfully welcomed from the first visit on. As a French citizen, I also liked the idea of coming to country with an old mix of cultures, and bilingual signs in the airport! What are you most looking forward to about joining the Medicine by Design community? The existence of Medicine by Design was a strong factor in choosing Toronto. I was lucky to train at institutions where interdisciplinarity has been the modus operandi for a long time, with very strong basic biological science emerging from cross-talks with so-called harder sciences. All those places also had in common a remarkable engineering tradition: I love to understand how things work, and then replicate what nature does to eventually go beyond. Medicine by Design is a community that understands that interdisciplinarity is key to leveraging the expertise of everyone on campus, to maximize benefits to humanity, patients in particular. A lot of fundamental science goes into laying out the groundwork for the greatest biomedical discoveries, and having a climate that promotes transitions is invaluable. My work on \"human-in-a-dish\" approaches will be very much at home here. What is one thing that people might not know about you from your CV? I love to play the piano and sing too loudly. My future colleagues might hear random renditions of Elton John's Tiny Dancer, or Jean-Jacques Goldman on the French side, late at night in the corridors of SickKids, once I figure out where the best acoustics are. Born and raised in the Alps, I am a winter sports enthusiast: if and when I find the time, I will be visiting the legendary ski resorts Canada has to offer.

I did my undergraduate studies in Dresden, Germany, and stayed there to join the Max Planck Graduate School for my PhD. After that it was time to explore the scientific world outside of Germany and I moved to Canada for my post-doctoral training in the lab of Gordon Keller at University Health Network in Toronto. Tell us about your research. During my PhD I became hooked on regenerative therapies to treat heart disease and was fascinated with the electrical wiring (conduction system) that controls the heartbeat. I followed that interest during my post-doc and worked on developing protocols for differentiating pluripotent stem cells into sinoatrial node pacemaker cells, the primary pacemaker cells that initiate the heartbeat. In cases of sinoatrial node failure, current treatment involves implantation of electronic pacemaker devices, but they have disadvantages, including the recurring need to replace batteries, lack of communication with the autonomous nervous system and lack of adaptation to growth in paediatric patients, which necessitates recurrent surgeries to refit pacemaker wires. Stem cell-derived biological pacemakers could overcome these disadvantages and represent an attractive future therapy. My lab will be working on refining strategies for the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into pacemaker cells and developing new strategies for generating additional cell types that are part of the heart's electrical wiring, such as atrioventricular nodal cells. By using pluripotent stem cells as a developmental model system, we will obtain new insights into human heart development in these projects. We will employ small and large pre-clinical animal models to test the ability of stem cell-derived pacemaker populations to work as biological pacemakers and regenerate the conduction system of the heart. I also plan on establishing new in vitro models for pacemaker diseases, such as congenital heart block, to study disease mechanisms and find novel drug treatment targets. Why did you decide to stay in Toronto? I decided to stay in Toronto because during my interviewing process for a principal investigator position, I realized that Toronto has a unique research environment that many other places I interviewed at were not able to offer. Toronto is both stem cell- and regenerative medicine-focused, but also has plenty of great basic research labs. And I started to really like Canadians - eh! What are you most looking forward to about joining the Medicine by Design community? I can't wait to join forces with the other Medicine by Design labs to develop new regenerative therapies. I especially appreciate the interdisciplinary and translational approach of the Medicine by Design program. Since my future plans involve developing a biological pacemaker, I am looking forward to collaborating with the excellent engineering labs in the Medicine by Design community to design 3D pacemaker tissues.
