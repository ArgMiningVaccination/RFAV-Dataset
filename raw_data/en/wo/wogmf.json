Read up on the vitamins and minerals your body needs.", "sitename": "The Recovery Village Drug and Alcohol Rehab", "date": "2022-01-18", "cleaned_text": "As the body detoxes from drugs or alcohol, the best thing you can do is give the body the vitamins and minerals it needs to function, as guided by your doctor. In recent years, the word \"detox\" has come to mean cleansing the body from everyday \"toxins\" by sticking to a special diet and even avoiding food altogether. But in the true medical sense, [detoxification](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/treatment-program/drug-detox/) is a process that the body undergoes naturally when removing harmful substances like drugs and alcohol from your system. This is why individuals often experience unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when undergoing a detox. Instead of restricting food, the best thing you can do is give the body what it needs to function. Detoxing isn't just about removing the bad stuff \u2014 it's also about replacing it with good. Article at a Glance: - Detoxification involves removing harmful substances from the body and replacing them with healthy things instead. - Addiction causes long-term nutrient deficiencies by changing the appetite, inhibiting nutrient absorption and encouraging empty calories. - B vitamins, C vitamins, omega-3 fatty acids, calcium and protein are necessary for drug detoxing. - You can get the vitamins you need during detox by focusing on a balanced diet, taking a multivitamin and detoxing in a medical setting. How Addiction Causes Vitamin Deficiencies [Drug and alcohol abuse](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/drug-addiction/) can cause long-term nutrient deficiencies in four ways: 1. Increasing Appetite Certain substances can cause food cravings. For example, individuals with an addiction to heroin often crave sweets and sugary foods. Marijuana users also often feel hungry while using and try to satisfy the craving with low-nutrient meals. 2. Decreasing Appetite [Meth](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/meth-addiction/), [crack](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/crack-addiction/), and [cocaine](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/cocaine-addiction/) users often have extremely decreased appetites. In this case, it's not that they're eating bad food necessarily. Rather, they're not eating enough at all. 3. Encouraging Empty Calories Alcoholics tend to get a huge amount of calories from drinks, but the drinks have little to no nutritional value. It's not just alcohol users: people with addictions of all kinds will struggle to put together healthy meals for themselves, opting instead for fast food and junk food. 4. Inhibiting Nutrient Absorption Even when an addicted individual does eat a healthy meal, chances are their bodies are not able to process the nutrients effectively. For example, alcoholism causes the body to struggle to absorb various forms of vitamin B. Vitamin B1, or thiamine, is especially important \u2014 a lack of B1 can cause [Korsakoff's Syndrome](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/alcohol-abuse/alcohol-brain-drinking/), also called \"wet brain.\" Even tobacco use causes a vitamin C deficiency and makes it hard for the body to use vitamin E, omega-3, zinc and beta-carotene. The Necessary Nutrients for Drug Detox When detoxing, the body will deplete its reserves for several nutrients and need extra nutritional support. Be sure to talk to your doctor before making any changes to your diet or taking any supplements, as they might not be right for your situation. For example, many alcoholics have a vitamin A deficiency, but we're not putting it on this list. Too much vitamin A in an alcoholic's body can cause [fibrosis](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh27-3/220-231.htm) in the liver (a buildup of scar tissue). Related Topic: [How to cleanse your liver from alcohol](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/alcohol-abuse/repair-liver-alcohol-use/) While there's no magic detox vitamin or supplement for alcohol withdrawal, there are certain nutrients that you may want to prioritize. The nutrients and detox vitamins your body likely needs most are: B Vitamins Vitamins B1, B3 and B5 all help your body convert sugar into energy. Vitamins B6 and B12 help your body produce blood cells. Unfortunately, heavy drinking and drug use inhibit the body's ability to absorb these nutrients. In general, individuals fighting with alcohol addiction can safely take [B1 (thiamine)](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh27-3/220-231.htm). A multivitamin supplement can also provide an adequate dosage of B2 (riboflavin) and B6 (pyridoxine). Vitamin B9 (folic acid) is another important piece of the puzzle that can usually be consumed through a normal, [healthy diet](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/treatment-program/drug-detox/ultimate-detox-diet-planning-guide/). C Vitamins Many people with a vitamin C (ascorbic acid) deficiency feel fatigued or depressed. These are the opposite of what you want when you're already facing withdrawal symptoms. Some studies have shown that adding Vitamin C to your diet can help alleviate symptoms not limited to [alcohol withdrawal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6306134/) and [heroin withdrawal](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10836211/). Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 has been linked to a host of benefits from heart health to helping with [depression](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/mental-health/depression/best-foods-for-depression/). While you can get this from eating fish, many people choose to go with fish oil supplements. When choosing a supplement, look for one that has both EPA and DHA. However, do not consume more than [3 grams of fish oil per day](https://foodandnutrition.org/january-february-2016/lowdown-essential-omega-3-fatty-acids-diet/), as too much can cause blood thinning. Calcium Alcohol interferes with the body's ability to absorb calcium. This poses a problem especially for women, who are at [risk for osteoporosis](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002149.htm) after [heavy drinking](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/alcohol-abuse/drinking-too-much/). Calcium supplements work best when you're also getting plenty of vitamin D, so lay in the sun for a bit to help your body produce what it needs. Protein Amino acids are the building blocks of protein. When the body breaks down protein you eat, it can use the amino acids to rebuild damaged cells and create neurotransmitters in the brain that help regulate drug cravings. The body can produce up to 12 amino acids on its own, but the remaining eight can only come from external sources. Studies have shown that amino acid supplements can be helpful for an individual with substance addictions. However, again, only take supplements with a doctor's guidance. A buildup of amino acids can cause negative effects such as brain damage. You can generally avoid this risk by forgoing supplements and focusing on supplying amino acids through varied protein-rich foods such as meat, eggs, beans, tofu, and quinoa. How to Get the Vitamins You Need 1. Start With a Balanced Diet and Multivitamin Supplement It will be hard to eat in the first few days of a drug or [alcohol detox](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/alcohol-abuse/alcohol-detox/), but eat what you can. If you choose to take a multivitamin, you may find it easier to begin with a liquid form so your body can absorb it easily. 2. Avoid \"Cleanses\" You might hear that a cleanse, such as drinking only juice or eating certain [detox foods](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/alcohol-abuse/withdrawal-detox/detox-foods-to-eat/), is the best way to clear your body of toxins. But the body is capable of cleansing itself, as long as it has the right nutrients. Instead of holding back nutrients, focus on giving your body the building blocks it needs by eating balanced meals. 3. Consider Detoxing in a Medical Setting Detoxing at home can be difficult, and in some cases, dangerous. In a [medical setting](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/treatment-program/medical-detox/), you'll have access to medicine and detox vitamins to help alleviate withdrawal symptoms and healthy meals to help your body begin the healing process.
