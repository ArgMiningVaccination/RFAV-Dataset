Revised: Jul 2021 SIDE EFFECTS Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directlycompared with rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. There is the possibility that broad use of SHINGRIX could reveal adverse reactions not observed in clinical trials. Adults Aged 50 Years And Older Overall, 17,041 adults aged 50 years and older received at least 1 dose of SHINGRIX in 17 clinical studies. The safety of SHINGRIX was evaluated by pooling data from 2 placebo-controlled clinical studies (Studies 1 and 2) involving 29,305 subjects aged50 years and older who received at least 1 dose of SHINGRIX (n = 14,645) or saline placebo (n = 14,660) administered according to a 0- and 2-monthschedule. At the time of vaccination, the mean age of the population was 69 years; 7,286 (25%) subjects were aged 50 to 59 years, 4,488 (15%) subjectswere aged 60 to 69 years, and 17,531 (60%) subjects were aged 70 years and older. Both studies were conducted in North America, Latin America,Europe, Asia, and Australia. In the overall population, the majority of subjects were White (74%), followed by Asian (18%), Black (1.4%), and otherracial/ethnic groups (6%); 58% were female. Solicited Adverse Reactions In Studies 1 and 2, data on solicited local and general adverse reactions were collected using standardized diary cards for7 days following each vaccine dose or placebo (i.e., day of vaccination and the next 6 days) in a subset of subjects (n = 4,886 receiving SHINGRIX,n = 4,881 receiving placebo with at least 1 documented dose). Across both studies, the percentages of subjects aged 50 years and older reporting eachsolicited local and general adverse reaction following administration of SHINGRIX (both doses combined) were pain (78%), redness (38%), and and (21%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (17%). The reported frequencies of specific solicited local adverse reactions and general adverse reactions (overall per subject), by age group, from the 2 studiesare presented in Table 1. Table 1: Percentage of Subjects with Solicited Local and General Adverse Reactions within 7 Daysa of Vaccination in Adults Aged 50 to 59 Years, 60 to 69 Years, and 70 Years and Olderb (Total Vaccinated Cohort with 7-Day |Total vaccinated cohort for safety included all subjects with at least 1 documented dose (n). | a7 days included day of vaccination and the subsequent 6 days. bData for subjects aged 50 to 59 years and 60 to 69 years are based on Study 1. Data for subjects 70 years and older are based on pooled data from Study1: NCT01165177 and Study 2: NCT01165229. cPlacebo was a saline solution. dGrade 3 pain: Defined as significant pain at rest; prevents normal everyday activities. eGrade 3 myalgia, fatigue, headache, shivering, and GI: Defined as preventing normal activity. fFever defined as 37.5\u00b0C/99.5\u00b0F for oral, axillary, or tympanic route, or 38\u00b0C/100.4\u00b0F for rectal route; Grade 3 fever defined as >39.0\u00b0C/102.2\u00b0F. gGI = Gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or abdominal pain. The incidence of solicited local and general reactions was lower in subjects aged 70 years and older compared with those aged 50 to 69 years. The local and general adverse reactions seen with SHINGRIX had a median duration of 2 to 3 days. There were no differences in the proportions of subjects reporting any or Grade 3 solicited local reactions between Dose 1 and Dose 2. Headache andshivering were reported more frequently by subjects after Dose 2 (28% and 21%, respectively) compared with Dose 1 (24% and 14%, respectively). Grade3 solicited general adverse reactions (headache, shivering, myalgia, and fatigue) were reported more frequently by subjects after Dose 2 (2.3%, 3%, 4%,and 4%, respectively) compared with Dose 1 (1.4%, 1.4%, 2.3%, and 2.4%, respectively). Unsolicited Adverse Events Unsolicited adverse events that occurred within 30 days following each vaccination (Day 0 to 29) were recorded on a diarycard by all subjects. In the 2 studies, unsolicited adverse events occurring within 30 days of vaccination were reported in 51% and 32% of subjects whoreceived SHINGRIX (n = 14,645) or placebo (n = 14,660), respectively (Total Vaccinated Cohort). Unsolicited adverse events that occurred in 1% ofrecipients of SHINGRIX and at a rate at least 1.5-fold higher than placebo included chills (4% versus 0.2%), and dizziness (1.2% versus 0.8%). Gout (including gouty arthritis) was reported by 0.18% (n = 27) versus 0.05% (n = 8) of subjects who received SHINGRIX or placebo, respectively, within30 days of vaccination; available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with SHINGRIX. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) In the 2 studies, SAEs were reported at similar rates in subjects who received SHINGRIX (2.3%) or placebo (2.2%) fromthe first administered dose up to 30 days post-last vaccination. SAEs were reported for 10.1% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and for 10.4% ofsubjects who received placebo from the first administered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination. One subject (<0.01%) reported lymphadenitis and 1subject (<0.01%) reported fever greater than 39\u00b0C; there was a basis for a causal relationship with SHINGRIX. Optic ischemic neuropathy was reported in 3 subjects (0.02%) who received SHINGRIX (all within 50 days after vaccination) and 0 subjects who receivedplacebo; available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with SHINGRIX. Deaths From the first administered dose up to 30 days post-last vaccination, deaths were reported for 0.04% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and0.05% of subjects who received placebo in the 2 studies. From the first administered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination, deaths were reported for 0.8%of subjects who received SHINGRIX and for 0.9% of subjects who received placebo. Causes of death among subjects were consistent with those generallyreported in adult and elderly populations. Potential Immune-Mediated Diseases In the 2 studies, new onset potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) or exacerbation of existing pIMDs werereported for 0.6% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and 0.7% of subjects who received placebo from the first administered dose up to 1 year post-lastvaccination. The most frequently reported pIMDs occurred with comparable frequencies in the group receiving SHINGRIX and the placebo group. Dosing Schedule In an open-label clinical study, 238 subjects 50 years and older received SHINGRIX as a 0- and 2-month or 0- and 6-month schedule.The safety profile of SHINGRIX was similar when administered according to a 0- and 2-month or 0- and 6-month schedule and was consistent with thatobserved in Studies 1 and 2. Immunocompromised Adults Aged 18 Years And Older The safety of SHINGRIX was evaluated in 6 placebo-controlled clinical studies that enrolled 3,116 subjects aged 18 years and older from 5 different immunodeficient or immunosuppressed (referred to as immunocompromised) populations, in which a total of 1,587 received SHINGRIX. In all studies, subjects received Doses 1 and 2 of SHINGRIX 1 to 2 months apart. Safety monitoring for these studies was similar to Studies 1 and 2. In addition, subjects were monitored for events relevant to their specific disease or condition. At the time of receipt of SHINGRIX or placebo, the mean age of the population was 55 years; 28% subjects were aged 18 to 49 years and 72% subjects were aged 50 years and older. Each of the studies was conducted in one or more of the following regions: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia/New Zealand. The majority of subjects were White (77%), followed by Asian (17%), Black (2%), and other racial groups (3%); 4%were of American Hispanic or Latino ethnicity; 37% were female.

In the auHSCT study (NCT01610414), at the time of receipt of SHINGRIX or placebo, the mean age of the population was 55 years; 25% of subjects were aged 18 to 49 years and 75% subjects were aged 50 years and older. The majority of subjects were White (78%), followed by Asian (16%), Black (2%),and other racial groups (3%); 3% were of American Hispanic or Latino ethnicity; 37% were female. Solicited Adverse Reactions Solicited local adverse reactions reported within 7 days following administration of SHINGRIX (both doses combined) inauHSCT recipients (aged 18 to 49 and 50 years of age) were pain (88% and 83%), redness (30% and 35%), and swelling (21% and 18%). Solicited general adverse reactions reported within 7 days following administration of SHINGRIX (both doses combined) in auHSCT recipients (aged 18 to 49 and50 years of age) were fatigue (64% and and fever (28% and 18%). The percentages of subjects aged 18 years and older reporting each solicited local and general adverse reaction following administration of each dose of SHINGRIX or placebo in the auHSCT study (NCT01610414) are presented in Table 3. Table 3: Adult auHSCT Recipients (NCT01610414): Percentage of Subjects with Solicited Local and General Adverse Reactions within 7 Daysa of Vaccination in Adults Aged 18 to 49 Years and 50 Years and Older by Dose (Total Vaccinated Cohort) |Total vaccinated cohort (TVC) for safety included all subjects with at least 1 documented dose (n). | % = Percentage of subjects reporting the symptom at least once. a7 days included day of vaccination and the subsequent 6 days. bPlacebo was sucrose reconstituted with saline solution. cGrade 3 pain: defined as significant pain at rest preventing normal everyday activities. dGrade 3 myalgia, fatigue, headache, shivering, and GI: defined as preventing normal activity. eGI = Gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or abdominal pain. In general, the reported frequencies of solicited local and general adverse reactions in the other studies in immunocompromised populations were similarto that in the auHSCT study (NCT01610414). The local and general adverse reactions seen with SHINGRIX had a median duration of 1 to 3 days acrossall studies enrolling immunocompromised subjects. Unsolicited Adverse Events Across all 6 studies enrolling immunocompromised subjects, unsolicited adverse events, including both serious and non-serious events, occurring within 30 days following each vaccination were reported in 46% and 44% of subjects who received SHINGRIX or placebo.Adverse events of arthralgia, infective pneumonia, and influenza-like illness occurred in 1% of recipients of SHINGRIX and at a rate at least 1.5-foldhigher than placebo (1.5% versus 1.0%, 1.5% versus 0.9%, and 1.3% versus 0.6%, respectively). Serious Adverse Events Across all 6 studies enrolling immunocompromised subjects, SAEs were reported at similar rates in subjects who received SHINGRIX (7%) or placebo (8%) from the first administered dose up to 30 days post-last vaccination. SAEs were reported for 26% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and for 27% of subjects who received placebo from the first administered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination. SAEs of infectivepneumonia were reported for 21 subjects (1.3%) who received SHINGRIX and for 11 subjects (0.7%) who received placebo up to 30 days post-lastvaccination. Available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship to vaccination. Deaths Across all 6 studies enrolling immunocompromised subjects, from the first administered dose up to 30 days post-last vaccination, deaths were reported for 2 subjects (0.1%) who received SHINGRIX and 7 subjects (0.5%) who received placebo. From the first administered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination, deaths were reported for 6% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and for 6% of subjects who received placebo. Causes of death among subjects were consistent with those expected in the populations evaluated. Potential Immune-Mediated Diseases Across all 6 studies enrolling immunocompromised subjects, new onset pIMDs or exacerbation of existing pIMDs were reported for 1.3% of subjects who received SHINGRIX and 1.0% of subjects who received placebo from the first administered dose up to 1 year post-last vaccination. There were no notable imbalances in specific pIMDs between treatment groups. Other Medically Relevant Events In the auHSCT study (NCT01610414), relapse or progression was reported by 315 of 922 subjects (34%) who receivedat least one dose of SHINGRIX and 331 of 924 subjects (36%) who received placebo from the first vaccination to study end. In the auHSCT study (NCT00920218), relapse or progression was reported by 17 of 59 subjects (29%) who received at least one dose of SHINGRIX and 8of 30 subjects (27%) who received placebo from the first vaccination to study end. In the hematologic malignancy study, relapse or progression was reported by 45 of 283 subjects (16%) who received at least one dose of SHINGRIX and58 of 279 subjects (21%) who received placebo from the first vaccination to study end. In the renal transplant study, biopsy-confirmed allograft rejection was reported by 4 of 132 (3%) of subjects who received SHINGRIX and by 7 of 132(5%) of subjects who received placebo from the first vaccination to study end (approximately 13 months later). Creatinine as a measure of graft functionand changes in alloimmunity post-vaccination were not systematically evaluated. In the HIV study, at least 1 event of worsening HIV condition was reported by 9 of 74 (12%) of subjects who received SHINGRIX and by 5 of 49 (10%)of subjects who received placebo from the first vaccination to study end. Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of SHINGRIX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from apopulation of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the vaccine. General Disorders And Administration Site Conditions Decreased mobility of the injected arm which may persist for 1 or more weeks. Immune System Disorders Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, rash, and urticaria. Nervous System Disorders Guillain-Barre syndrome. Postmarketing Observational Study of the Risk of Guillain-Barre Syndrome following Vaccination with SHINGRIX The association between vaccination with SHINGRIX and GBS was evaluated among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older. Using Medicareclaims data, from October 2017 through February 2020, vaccinations with SHINGRIX among beneficiaries were identified through National Drug Codes,and potential cases of hospitalized GBS among recipients of SHINGRIX were identified through International Classification of Diseases codes. The risk of GBS following vaccination with SHINGRIX was assessed in self-controlled case series analyses using a risk window of 1 to 42 days post-vaccination and a control window of 43 to 183 days post-vaccination. The primary analysis (claims-based, all doses) found an increased risk of GBS during the 42 days following vaccination with SHINGRIX, with an estimated 3 excess cases of GBS per million doses administered to adults aged65 years or older. In secondary analyses, an increased risk of GBS was observed during the 42 days following the first dose of SHINGRIX, with an estimated 6 excess cases of GBS per million doses administered to adults aged 65 years or older, and no increased risk of GBS was observed following the second dose of SHINGRIX. These analyses of GBS diagnoses in claims data were supported by analyses of GBS cases confirmed by medical record review. While the results of this observational study suggest a causal association of GBS with SHINGRIX, available evidence is insufficient to establish acausal relationship. DRUG INTERACTIONS No Information provided WARNINGS Included as part of the \"PRECAUTIONS\" Section PRECAUTIONS Preventing And Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions Prior to administration, the healthcare provider should review the immunization history for possible vaccine sensitivity and previous vaccination-related adverse reactions. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of SHINGRIX. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility SHINGRIX has not been evaluated for its carcinogenic or mutagenic potential. Vaccination of female rats with SHINGRIX had no effect on fertility [see Use In Specific Populations]. In a male fertility study, rats were vaccinated with 0.1 mL of SHINGRIX (a single human dose is 0.5 mL) on 42, 28, and 14 days prior to mating. There were no effects on male fertility. Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. There are no available human data to establish whether there is vaccine-associated risk with SHINGRIX in pregnant women. A reproductive and developmental toxicity study was performed in female rats administered SHINGRIX or the AS01B adjuvant alone prior to mating, during gestation, and during lactation. The total dose was 0.2 mL on each occasion (a single human dose of SHINGRIX is 0.5 mL). This study revealed no adverse effects on fetal or pre-weaning development due to SHINGRIX (see Data). Data Animal Data In a reproductive and developmental toxicity study, female rats were administered SHINGRIX or the AS01B adjuvant alone by intramuscular injection 28 and 14 days prior to mating, on gestation Days 3, 8, 11, and 15, and on lactation Day 7. The total dose was 0.2 mL on each occasion (a single human dose of SHINGRIX is 0.5 mL). No adverse effects on pre-weaning development up to post-natal Day 25 were observed. There were no vaccine-related fetal malformations or variations. Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether SHINGRIX is excreted in human milk. Data are not available to assess the effects of SHINGRIX on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for SHINGRIX and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from SHINGRIX or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in individuals younger than 18 years have not been established. SHINGRIX is not indicated for prevention of primary varicella infection (chickenpox). Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects who received at least 1 dose of SHINGRIX in the 2 efficacy trials (n = 14,645), 2,243 (15.3%) were aged 60 to 69 years, 6,837 (46.7%) were aged 70 to 79 years, and 1,921 (13.1%) were 80 years and older. There were no clinically meaningful differences in efficacy across the age groups or between these subjects and younger subjects. [see Clinical Studies] The frequencies of solicited local and general adverse events in subjects aged 70 years and older were lower than in younger adults (aged 50 through 69 years). [See ADVERSE REACTIONS] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism Of Action The risk of developing HZ, which increases with age and with immunosuppression due to disease and/or therapy, appears to be related to a decline in varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific immunity. SHINGRIX was shown to boost VZV-specific immune response, which is thought to be the mechanism by which it protects against zoster disease [see Clinical Studies]. Clinical Studies Efficacy In Subjects Aged 50 Years And Older Study 1 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical study conducted in 18 countries. Randomization was stratified (8:5:3:1) by age: 50to 59 years, 60 to 69 years, 70 to 79 years, and 80 years. The study excluded, among others, subjects who were immunocompromised, had a history ofprevious HZ, were vaccinated against varicella or HZ, and patients whose survival was not expected to be at least 4 years or with conditions that mightinterfere with study evaluations. Subjects were followed for the development of HZ and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) for a median of 3.1 years (range: 0to 3.7 years). Suspected HZ cases were followed prospectively for the development of PHN, an HZ-related complication defined as HZ-associated pain(rated as 3 or greater on a 0- to 10-point scale by the study subject) occurring or persisting at least 90 days following the onset of rash in confirmed casesof HZ. The primary efficacy analysis population (referred to as the modified Total Vaccinated Cohort [mTVC]) included 14,759 subjects aged 50 years and older who received 2 doses (0 and 2 months) of either SHINGRIX (n = 7,344) or placebo (n = 7,415) and did not develop a confirmed case of HZ within 1month after the second dose. In the mTVC population, 61% were female; 72% were White, 19% were Asian, 1.7% were Black, and 7% were of other racial/ethnic groups. The mean age of subjects was 62.3 years. Confirmed HZ cases were determined by either Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) (89.4%) or by a Clinical Evaluation Committee (10.6%). Efficacy Against Herpes Zoster Compared with placebo, SHINGRIX significantly reduced the developing HZ by 97.2% (95% CI: 93.7, 99.0) in subjects aged 50 years and older(Table 4). Table 4: Efficacy of SHINGRIX on Incidence of Herpes Zoster Compared with Placebo in 1 (mTVC) (Years)||SHINGRIX||Placebo||% Efficacy (95% CI)| (87.9, 100.0) |N = Number of subjects included in each group; n = Number of subjects having at least 1 confirmed HZ episode; HZ = 1: NCT01165177. bmTVC = Modified Total Vaccinated Cohort defined as subjects who received 2 doses (0 and 2 months) of either SHINGRIX or placebo and did notdevelop a confirmed case of HZ within 1 month after the second dose. cPrimary study endpoint was based on confirmed HZ cases in subjects aged 50 years and older. In a descriptive analysis, vaccine efficacy against HZ in subjects aged 50 years and older was 93.1% (95% CI: 81.3, 98.2) in the fourth year post-vaccination. Occurrence Of Postherpetic Neuralgia Among all subjects aged 50 years or older in the mTVC, no cases of PHN were reported in the vaccine group compared with 18 cases reported in theplacebo group. Efficacy In Subjects Aged 70 Years And Older Study 2 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical study conducted in 18 countries. Randomization was stratified (3:1) by age: 70 to79 years and 80 years. With the exception of age, the study exclusion criteria were the same as for Study 1. Subjects were followed for the developmentof HZ and PHN for a median of 3.9 years (range: 0 to 4.5 years). Suspected HZ cases were followed prospectively for the development of PHN as forStudy 1. The primary efficacy analysis population (mTVC) included 13,163 subjects aged 70 years and older who received 2 doses (0 and 2 months) of eitherSHINGRIX (n = 6,541) or placebo (n = 6,622) and did not develop a confirmed case of HZ within 1 month after the second dose. In the mTVC population, 55% were female; 78% were White, 17% were Asian, 1% were Black, and 4% were of other racial/ethnic groups. The mean age of subjects was75.5 years. Confirmed HZ cases were determined by either PCR (92.3%) or by a Clinical Evaluation Committee (7.7%). Efficacy Against Herpes Zoster Vaccine efficacy results against HZ in subjects aged 70 years and older are shown in Table 5.

In a descriptive analysis, vaccine efficacy against HZ in subjects aged 70 years and older was 85.1% (95% CI: 64.5, 94.8) in the fourth year aftervaccination. Efficacy Against Postherpetic Neuralgia Among all subjects aged 70 years or older in the mTVC, 4 cases of PHN were reported in the vaccine group compared with 28 cases reported in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy against PHN was 85.5% (95% CI: [58.5; 96.3]). The benefit of in the prevention of PHN can be attributed tothe effect of the vaccine on the prevention of HZ. Reduction Of Use Of Pain Medication Among subjects with confirmed HZ, the use of HZ-associated pain medications was reported for 10 of 23 subjects (43.5%) who received SHINGRIX and for 160 of 223 subjects (71.7%) who received placebo. Pooled Efficacy Analyses Across Studies 1 And 2 The efficacy of SHINGRIX to prevent HZ and PHN in subjects aged 70 years and older was evaluated by combining the results from Studies 1 and 2through a pre-specified pooled analysis in the mTVC. A total of 8,250 and 8,346 subjects who received SHINGRIX and placebo, respectively, wereincluded in the pooled mTVC analysis. Efficacy against Herpes Zoster Compared with placebo, SHINGRIX significantly reduced the risk of developing HZ by 91.3% (95% CI: 86.9, 94.5) in subjects 70 years and older(Table 6).

The benefit of SHINGRIX in the prevention of PHN can be attributed to the effect of the vaccine on the prevention of HZ. The efficacy of SHINGRIX inthe prevention of PHN in subjects with confirmed HZ could not be demonstrated. Immunological Evaluation To Support Dosing Schedule A measure of the immune response that confers protection against HZ is unknown. Anti-gE antibody levels were measured by anti-gE enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (gE ELISA) and were used to support the dosing schedule. In an open-label clinical study, 238 subjects 50 years and older received SHINGRIX on either a 0- and 2-month or 0- and 6-month schedule. Non-inferiority of the 0- and 6-month schedule compared with the 0- and 2-month schedule based on anti-gE ELISA GMCs 1 month after the second dose wasdemonstrated. Concomitant Administration With Influenza Vaccine In an open-label clinical study, subjects 50 years and older received 1 dose each of SHINGRIX and FLUARIX QUADRIVALENT (QIV) at Month 0 and 1dose of SHINGRIX at Month 2 (n = 413), or 1 dose of QIV at Month 0 and 1 dose of SHINGRIX at Months 2 and 4 (n = 415). There was no evidence forinterference in the immune response to any of the antigens contained in SHINGRIX or the coadministered vaccine. Efficacy In Immunocompromised Adults Aged 18 Years And Older The efficacy of SHINGRIX was evaluated in one Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind clinical study in immunocompromised adultsaged 18 years who received an auHSCT 50 to 70 days prior to Dose 1 and who were expected to receive prophylactic antiviral therapy for 6 monthspost-transplant. The efficacy of SHINGRIX was calculated post-hoc in another randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study in subjects withhematologic malignancies who received Dose 1 of SHINGRIX or placebo during or within 6 months of completing immunosuppressive chemotherapy.Each of these studies was conducted in the following regions: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa (auHSCT study only), andAustralia/New Zealand. Efficacy In Subjects Aged 18 Years And Older: auHSCT Recipients In the auHSCT study, subjects were followed for the development of HZ and PHN for a median of 21 months (range: 0 to 49.4 months). Suspected HZcases were followed prospectively for the development of PHN as in Studies 1 and 2. The primary efficacy analysis population (mTVC) for the auHSCT study included 1,721 subjects who received 2 doses of either SHINGRIX or placeboand did not develop a confirmed case of HZ within 1 month after the second dose. Confirmed HZ cases were determined by either PCR (83.7%) or by aClinical Evaluation Committee (16.3%). Efficacy Against Herpes Zoster Compared with placebo, SHINGRIX significantly reduced the risk of developing HZ in auHSCT recipients aged 18 yearsand older (Table 8).

Efficacy In Subjects Aged 18 Years And Older With Hematologic Malignancies In the study of hematologic malignancies, the mean age was 57 years. The majority of subjects were White (71%), followed by Asian (25%), Black(0.4%), and other racial groups (4%); 5% were of American Hispanic or Latino ethnicity; and 41% were female. Subjects were followed for thedevelopment of HZ for a median of 11.1 months (range: 0 to 15.6 months). PHN was not assessed as a study endpoint. In the hematologic [malignancy](https://www.rxlist.com/malignancy/definition.htm) study, the population for the post hoc efficacy analysis included 515 subjects who received 2 doses of either SHINGRIX orplacebo and did not develop a confirmed case of HZ within 1 month after the second dose. Confirmed HZ cases were determined by either PCR (81.3%)or by a Clinical Evaluation Committee (18.7%). The post hoc analysis showed SHINGRIX was 87.2% (95% CI [44.2; 98.6]) effective againstdevelopment The incidence rate of HZ per 1,000 person-years was 8.5 versus 66.2 in the SHINGRIX and placebo groups, respectively. Additional Efficacy Endpoints Evaluated In The auHSCT Study Efficacy Against Postherpetic Neuralgia In a descriptive analysis, including all subjects aged 18 years in the mTVC, 1 case of PHN was reported in thevaccine group compared with 9 cases reported in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy against PHN was 89.3% (95% CI: [22.5; 99.8]). The benefit ofSHINGRIX in the prevention of PHN can be attributed to the effect of the vaccine on the prevention of HZ. Herpes Zoster-Associated Pain Subjects with suspected HZ rated their \"worst\" HZ-associated pain on a 10-point scale. Among subjects with confirmedHZ, 37 out of 49 subjects (75.5%) receiving SHINGRIX and 120 out of 135 subjects (88.9%) receiving placebo rated their \"worst\" HZ-associated pain as3 or greater. In this subset of subjects, the median duration of \"worst\" HZ associated pain was 14 and 24 days, among SHINGRIX and placebo recipients,respectively.
