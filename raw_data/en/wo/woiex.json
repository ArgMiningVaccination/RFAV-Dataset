In the present study we compare the immune response generated against ED-B using the non-toxic and biodegradable adjuvant Montanide ISA 720/CpG with the response elicited by Freund's adjuvant. Montanide ISA 720/CpG induced anti-ED-B antibodies with higher avidity and less variable levels between individuals than Freund's. Moreover, the duration of the immune response was longer and the generation of anti-ED-B antibodies in na\u00efve mice was faster, when Montanide ISA 720/CpG was used. We conclude that it is possible to replace the mineral oil based adjuvant Freund's with an adjuvant acceptable for human use, which is a prerequisite for transfer of the ED-B vaccine to the clinic.
