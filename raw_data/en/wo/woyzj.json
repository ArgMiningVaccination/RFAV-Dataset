ATLANTA, May 10, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Micron Biomedical, a life science company developing first-in-class dissolvable microarray-based products that are simplifying and advancing the delivery and administration of drugs and vaccines, today announced it has secured an additional $3 million investment from J2 Ventures, bringing its total Series A funding to $17 million. Announced originally in November 2022, the Series A was led by Global Health Investment Corporation (GHIC) and LTS Lohmann with participation from GRA Venture Fund. The Series A extension will further support efforts to bring the company's dissolvable microarray-based drug and vaccine products to markets globally, providing convenience and access in high income markets, including a focus on national health security, and meeting the needs of under-served populations in low- and middle-income countries. J2 Ventures Partner and former Chief Medical Officer of the Defense Innovation Unit, US Department of Defense, Dr. Matt Goldman, will join Micron's board as an observer. Micron's patented microarray technology allows drugs and vaccines that today require cold storage and administration through injection to be self-administered or caregiver administered within minutes, without the need for refrigeration or administration by a skilled health professional. The technology significantly expands access by simplifying transport, storage and administration and eliminates traditional injection sharps waste. Completed trials show clinical efficacy and strong patient preference for Micron's technology over injections. \"We're excited by J2 Ventures' support of our commercial strategy to bring important drug and vaccine products to markets globally,\" said Micron CEO, Steven Damon. \"We've been speaking with the team since they learned about us after our initial financing, and their participation coincides with significant commercial interest from their network, helping to further our goal of making this technology widely available to patients.\" \"Our fund specializes in working with best-in-class deep technology that is primed to scale with government and Micron Biomedical is an obvious fit,\" said Alexander Harstrick, Co-Founder and Managing Partner at J2 Ventures. \"We are thrilled to support Micron's efforts that have the potential to radically disrupt the most significant logistical obstacles in delivering pharmaceutical and vaccine products to both private sectors and the government. Products that utilize the Micron technology have the potential to accelerate positive global impact including national security and veteran health.\" About Micron Biomedical Micron Biomedical is the leader in the field of dissolvable microarray-based, drug and vaccine administration technology.
