(a) Section 2502 of the Afghanistan Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022 (division C of Public La w 117-43) is amended\u2014 (1) in subsection (a)(1)(A) by striking \"September 30, 2022\" and inserting \"September 30, 2023\"; and (2) in subsection (b) by striking \"March 31, 2023\" and inserting \"March 31, 2024\". (b)Amounts pro vided by this section are designated by the Congress as being for an emer gency requirement pursuant to the concurrent resolution on the b udget. Language is needed to extend authority provided in the Afghanistan Supplemental Appro- priations Act, 2022 (division C of Public Law 117-43) to those Afghans paroled into the United States during FY 2023. Without the anomaly, Afghans paroled into the United States would not be eligible for resettlement assistance, entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program food assistance, and other bene- fits. Appropriated Entitlements and Other Mandatory Payments Sec. ___. (a) F or entitlements and other mandatory payments whose b udget authority was pro vided in appropriations Acts for fiscal year 2022, and for acti vities under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, acti vities shall be continued at the rate to maintain program le vels under current la w, under the authority and conditions pro vided in the applicable appropriations Act for fiscal year 2022, to be continued through the date specified in section 106(3). (b) Notwithstanding section 106, oblig ations for mandatory payments due on or about the first day of an y month that be gins after October 2022 b ut not later than 30 days after the date specified in section 106(3) may continue to be made, and funds shall be a vailable for such payments. Language is needed to ensure that funding for appropriated entitlements and other mandatory payments will continue at the rate to maintain program levels under current law and to ensure benefit payments are issued in a timely manner. Appropriated entitlements include, but are not limited to: Grants to States for Medicaid; Payments to States for Child Support Enforce- ment and Family Support Programs; Social Services Block Grant; Payments for Foster Care, Prevention, and Permanency; Payments to Health Care Trust Funds; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; Child Nutrition Programs; and the Supplemental Security Income Program. Continuing Rescissions of Discretionary Prior-Year Funds Sec. ___. (a) Rescissions or cancellations of discretionary b udget authority that continue pursuant to section 101 in Treasury Appropriations Fund Symbols (T AFS)\u2014 4(1) to which other appropriations are not pro vided by this Act, b ut for which there is a current applicable TAFS that does recei ve an appropriation in this Act; or (2) which are no-year TAFS and recei ve other appropriations in this Act, may be continued instead by reducing the rate for operations otherwise pro vided by section 101 for such current applicable TAFS, as long as doing so does not impinge on the final funding prerog atives of the Congress. (b) Rescissions or cancellations described in subsection (a) shall continue in an amount equal to the lesser of\u2014 (1) the amount specified for rescission or cancellation in the applicable appropriations Act referenced in section 101 of this Act; or (2) the amount of balances a vailable, as of October 1, 2022, from the funds specified for rescission or cancellation in the applicable appropriations Act referenced in section 101 of this Act. (c) No later than No vember 22, 2022, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall pro vide to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Represent- atives and the Senate a comprehensi ve list of the rescissions or cancellations that will continue pursuant to section 101: Provided , That the information in such comprehensi ve list shall be periodically updated to reflect an y subsequent changes in the amount of balances a vailable, as of October 1, 2022, from the funds specified for rescission or cancellation in the applicable appropriations Act referenced in section 101, and such updates shall be transmitted to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representati ves and the Senate upon request. Language is needed to allow continuing discretionary rescissions from prior-year funds in accounts with a rate for operations in the CR to be effectuated as a reduction in that rate for operations, rather than as a preclusion of carryover balances. Allowing agencies to reduce their rate for operations provides an affected account with the same annualized funding level as is otherwise provided by section 101. The language provides a reporting date on the comprehensive lists of rescissions that will allow final data to be reported. Intelligence Programs, State and International Assistance Waivers Sec. ___. Funds appropriated by this Act may be oblig ated and e xpended notwithstanding section 10 of Public La w 91-672 (22 U.S.C. 2412), section 15 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2680), section 313 of the F oreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (22 U.S.C. 6212), and section 504(a)(1) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3094(a)(1)). Language is needed to authorize specific intelligence activities for the various Intelligence Program components before funds can be obligated or expended, as required by section 504 of the National Security Act of 1947. The Intelligence Program includes the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, and elements of the Departments of Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, Justice, State, and the Treasury. In- telligence activities will not continue in the absence of this authority. In addition, in the 5absence of an authorization bill, the Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, United States Agency for Global Media, and other agencies that operate under the authority of the State Department Basic Authorities Act and Foreign Relations Author- ization Act also need waiver language that enables them to expend funds. Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Buildings and Facilities Rescission Sec. ___. Notwithstanding section 101, section 783 of di vision A of Public La w 117- 103 shall not apply during the period co vered by this Act. Language is needed to prevent the FY 2022 enacted $73 million rescission of unobligated balances from prior-year appropriations in the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Buildings and Facilities account from recurring during the period of the CR. USDA is planning to award a contract for the next phase of a building modernization project before the end of FY 2022, but it is possible that the award will not be made until the first month of FY 2023. Without this anomaly, if the contract is not awarded prior to the end of FY 2022, USDA's resources provided by the CR will be reduced by the full $73 million, resulting in insufficient funding to support ongoing maintenance and operations costs. If the contract is awarded prior to the end of FY 2022, then the recurring rescission level will be much smaller. Farm Loan Obligation Authority Sec. ___. Section 346(b)(2) of the Consolidated F arm and Rural De velopment Act (7 U.S.C. 1994(b)(2)) is amended\u2014 (1) the e xtent practicable\" after 1 of the fiscal year\"; (2) subparagraph (A)(iii) by inserting \"to the e xtent practicable\" after \"September 1 of the fiscal year\"; and (3) in subparagraph (B)(iii) by inserting \"to the e xtent practicable\" after \"April 1 of the fiscal year\". Language is needed to provide the Department of Agriculture (USDA) with additional flexibility to meet the demand for direct and guaranteed farm ownership loans without arti- ficially increasing the total loan levels available under the CR. Current law requires USDA to reserve 75 percent of direct and 40 percent of guaranteed farm ownership loans for socially disadvantaged (SDA) farmers, although the majority of the demand for these programs is from non-SDA farmers. After setting aside the required portions of the total loan level available during the CR, there is not sufficient authority remaining to fund the demand from non-SDA farmers. The anomaly would provide USDA with the authority to meet loan de- mand from non-SDA farmers without delays and without artificially contorting the loan level, while still providing loans to SDA farmers to the extent there is demand. Without this anomaly, USDA would continue taking administrative steps to artificially increase the 6total loan level during the period the CR, delaying loans to non-SDA farmers and risking future participation by guaranteed lenders. Farm Service Agency Salaries and Expenses Account Restructuring Sec. ___. Notwithstanding section 101, the matter under the heading \"F arm Service Agenc y\u2014Salaries and Expenses\" in title II of di vision A of Public La w 117-103 shall be applied during the period co vered by this Act by striking the fifth pro viso and inserting the follo wing: \" Provided further , That of the amount appropriated under this heading, $696,594,000 shall be made a vailable to county committees, to remain a vailable until expended:\". Language is needed to authorize the Department of Agriculture to obligate funds provided by the CR in the Farm Service Agency (FSA), Salaries and Expenses account using the budget structure proposed in the FY 2023 Budget request, which provides a separate appro- priation to county committees from within the account. Without the anomaly, FSA would need to execute this activity in the Salaries and Expenses account under the FY 2022 Budget structure during the CR using non-expenditure transfers and written apportionments. Without the anomaly, manual adjustments of the obligations and disbursements would be required, resulting in an administrative burden adversely impacting FSA's mission execution, as staff would devote more time to duplicative administrative work. Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program Sec. ___. Amounts made a vailable by section 101 to the Department of Agriculture for \"Rural Business\u2014Cooperati ve Service\u2014Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Pro- gram\" may be used for the costs of loans, including the cost of modifying such loans, as defined in section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, under the same terms and conditions as authorized by section 379E of the Consolidated F arm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 2008s). Language is needed to provide the Department of Agriculture with authority to spend ap- propriations in the Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program account on the cost of direct loans, in addition to grants that are already authorized, to ensure continued operation of the program during the period of the CR. In FY 2022 the program has a negative subsidy rate, but beginning in FY 2023 it will have a positive subsidy rate. This anomaly would provide authority to spend appropriations available under the CR on the subsidy cost of direct loans in compliance with the Federal Credit Reform Act. Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Economic Development Administration - CARES Act Grants Sec. ___. In addition to amounts pro vided by section 101, amounts are pro vided for \"Department of Commerce\u2014Economic De velopment Administration\u2014Salaries and Expenses\" at a rate for operations of $12,000,000, for an additional amount for staffing and associated support costs to administer grants a warded in prior fiscal years pursuant to the Corona virus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (Public La w 116-136). 7Language is needed to provide the Department of Commerce with an additional rate for operations of $12 million for the Economic Development Administration (EDA), Salaries and Expenses account to fund staffing and overhead to administer CARES Act grants. Funding provided for this activity in the CARES Act expires on September 30, 2022. Without this anomaly, EDA would not have enough resources to meet its mission of ensuring proper compliance and reporting of grant funding. Public Safety Communications Program Sec. ___. Notwithstanding section 101, amounts are pro vided for \"Department of Commerce\u2014National Telecommunications and Information Administration\u2014Salaries and Expenses\" at a rate for operations of $54,044,000. Language is needed to provide the Department of Commerce a rate for operations of $54 million for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), Salaries and Expenses account to provide discretionary resources for the Public Safety Communications Program. Funding for this program was previously provided out of the Public Safety Trust Fund, which will terminate on September 30, 2022. Without this anomaly, NTIA will be unable to meet all statutory responsibilities for its oversight of FirstNet. Afghan Resettlement Requirements - Federal Bureau of Investigation Sec. ___. In addition to amounts otherwise pro vided by section 101, for \"Department of Justice\u2014Federal Bureau of In vestigation\u2014Salaries and Expenses\", there is appropri- ated $15,300,000, for an additional amount for fiscal year 2023, to remain a vailable until September 30, 2023, for in vestigative acti vities associated with Afghan resettlement operations: Provided, That such amounts are designated by the Congress as being for an emer gency requirement pursuant to the concurrent resolution on the b udget. Language is needed to provide the Department of Justice an additional appropriation of $15 million in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Salaries and Expenses account to support ongoing Afghan refugee resettlement investigative efforts under Operation Enduring Wel- come. Funding for these activities was previously provided in the Afghanistan Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022 (division C of Public Law 117-43) for Operation Allies Welcome, which expires at the end of FY 2022. Defense Afghan Resettlement Requirements - Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid Transfer Authority Sec. ___. Notwithstanding sections 101 and 106, through September 30, 2023, the Secretary of Defense may transfer unoblig ated balances from amounts made a vailable under the heading \"Department of Defense\u2014Operation and Maintenance\u2014Ov erseas Humanitarian, Disaster , and Ci vic Aid\" in di vision C of Public La w 117-43 and di vision B of Public La w 117-70 to an y appropriation account a vailable to the Department of State for support of Operation Allies Welcome or an y successor operation: Provided, That upon transfer , the funds shall be mer ged with the appropriation to which the funds are transferred e xcept that such funds may be made a vailable for such purposes notwith- 8standing an y requirement or limitation applicable to the appropriation to which trans- ferred, including sections 2(c)(1) and 2(c)(2) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act with respect to the Emer gency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund and in section 4(a) and section 4(b) of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 with respect to funds transferred to the Emer gencies in the Diplomatic and Consular Service ac- count: Provided further , That section 2215 of title 10, United States Code, shall not apply to a transfer of funds under this section: Provided further , That the transfer author - ity pro vided under this section is in addition to an y other transfer authority pro vided by law: Provided further , That an y funds transferred pursuant to this section that were previously designated by the Congress as an emer gency requirement pursuant to the concurrent resolution on the b udget shall be designated by the Congress as being for an emer gency requirement pursuant to the concurrent resolution on the b udget. Language is needed to authorize the transfer of unobligated funds provided to the Department of Defense, Operation and Maintenance, Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid account in the Afghanistan Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022 and the Additional Afghanistan Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022 to the Department of State for continu- ing support of Operation Allies Welcome and the successor operation, Enduring Welcome. Without this anomaly, excess funding would not be available to the Department of State for these operations. Afghanistan Security Forces Fund Sec. ___. (a) Of the remaining unoblig ated balances of funds as of September 30, 2022, from amounts pro vided under the heading \" Afghanistan Security F orces Fund\" in title IX of di vision C of Public La w 116-260, $100,000,000 is hereby permanently cancelled. (b) There is appropriated on September 30, 2022, $100,000,000, to remain a vailable until September 30, 2026: Provided , That such amount shall be a vailable for the same purposes and under the same authorities pro vided under such heading in Public La w 116-260, as amended by section 2204 of title II of di vision C of Public La w 117-43, in addition to an y other amounts a vailable for such purposes. (c) This section shall become ef fective immediately upon enactment of this Act. (d) If this Act is enacted after September 30, 2022, this section shall be applied as if it were in ef fect on September 30, 2022. Language is needed to provide $100 million in funding for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) to pay outstanding invoices for contract costs associated with cancelled ASFF accounts, which are no longer available for payment of upward adjustments. To offset these costs, the language cancels $100 million in funding from funding that otherwise expires on September 30, 2022. Without the anomaly, outstanding obligations from these cancelled accounts would be sent to the Judgment Fund for payment. Military Operational and Training Cost Increases Sec. ___. (a) Amounts made a vailable by section 101 to the Department of Defense for \"Operation and Maintenance\u2014Operation and Maintenance, Na vy\" may be apportioned 9up to the rate for operations necessary to a void disruption of continuing projects or activities funded in this appropriation. (b) Amounts made a vailable by section 101 to the Department of Defense for \"Operation and Maintenance\u2014Operation and Maintenance, Na vy Reserv e\" may be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary to a void disruption of continuing projects or acti vities funded in this appropriation. (c) Amounts made a vailable by section 101 to the Department of Defense for \"Operation and Maintenance\u2014Operation and Maintenance, Air F orce\" may be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary to a void disruption of continuing projects or acti vities funded in this appropriation. (d) Amounts made a vailable by section 101 to the Department of Defense for \"Operation and Maintenance\u2014Operation and Maintenance, Air F orce Reserv e\" may be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary to a void disruption of continuing projects or activities funded in this appropriation. (e) Amounts made a vailable by section 101 to the Department of Defense for \"Operation and Maintenance\u2014Operation and Maintenance, Air National Guard\" may be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary to a void disruption of continuing projects or activities funded in this appropriation. Language is needed to authorize the Department of Defense to obligate funding under a CR in the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Navy, Navy Reserve, Air Force, Air Force Re- serve, and Air National Guard accounts at a rate for operations necessary to avoid disruption of its activities due to increased operational and training costs, including the increased cost of fuel. Without the anomaly, the O&M accounts would face significant operational impacts. Protection and Personal Security Extension Sec. ___. Notwithstanding section 106, during the period be ginning on the date of en- actment of this Act and ending on January 1, 2024, subsection (b) of section 714 of title 10, United States Code, shall be applied\u2014 (1) in paragraph (1)(A), by substituting \"a serious and credible threat\" for \"an imminent and credible threat\"; and (2) in paragraph (2)(B), by substituting \"three years' ' for ' 'two years\". Language is needed to extend authority provided by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7714 to provide physical protection and personal security within the United States to former or retired Department of Defense (DOD) officials for one additional year. Without the anomaly, physical protection and personal security of former or retired DOD officials is limited to two years following separation from DOD. Rapid Defense Experimentation Reserve Sec. ___. (a) Notwithstanding sections 102 and 104, amounts made a vailable by section 101 to the Department of Defense for \"Research, De velopment, Test and aluation, Army\" may be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary for project initiation and joint e xperimentation e xecution asso- ciated with Rapid Defense Experimentation Reserv e projects. (b) Notwithstanding sections 102 and 104, in addition to amounts otherwise pro vided by section 101, amounts are pro vided to the Department of Defense for \"Research, De- velopment, and Ev aluation, Na vy\" at a rate for operations of $108,000,000, for project initiation and joint e xperimentation execution associated with the Rapid Defense Experimentation Reserv e, and such amounts may be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary to carry out such projects. (c) Notwithstanding sections 102 and 104, in addition to amounts otherwise pro vided by section 101, amounts are pro vided to the Department of Defense for \"Research, De- velopment, and Ev aluation, Air Force\" at a rate for operations of $64,000,000, for project initiation and joint e xperiment- ation e xecution associated with the Rapid Defense Experimentation Reserv e, and such amounts may be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary to carry out such projects. (d) In addition to amounts pro vided by section 101, amounts are pro vided to the Depart- ment of Defense for \"Research, De velopment, Test at a rate for operations of $46,000,000, for joint e xperimentation planning, project initiation, and e xecution associated with Rapid Defense Experimentation Reserv e projects: Provided , That such amounts, as well as up to $34,000,000 of the amounts made a vailable by section 101 for such projects in such account, may be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary to carry out such projects. Language is needed to authorize the Department of Defense to obligate funding under the CR formula in the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDTE), Army account at a rate for operations necessary for project initiation and joint experimentation execution associated with Rapid Defense Experimentation Reserve (RDER) projects. In addition, language is needed to provide an additional rate for operations of $108 million and $64 million for the RDTE accounts of the Navy and Air Force, respectively, and authority to obligate this funding at a rate for operations necessary for project initiation and joint exper- imentation execution associated with RDER projects. Language is also needed to provide an additional rate for operations of $46 million for the RDTE, Defense-wide account and authority to obligate it, and up to $34 million provided under the CR formula, at rate for operations necessary to carry out RDER projects. Without the anomaly, specific activities within the RDER program, including through regional exercises, would be delayed by at least one year. Red Hill Sec. ___. Notwithstanding sections 101 and 106 of this Act, for the duration of fiscal year 2023, amounts made a vailable in fiscal year 2023 to the Department of Defense under the heading \"Operation and Maintenance\u2014Operation and Maintenance, Na vy\", other than amounts designated by the Congress as being for an emer gency requirement pursuant to the concurrent resolution on the b udget, may be used for emer gencies and 11extraordinary e xpenses, in addition to an y other funds specifically made a vailable for such e xpenses, for purposes the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the Na vy, as appropriate, determines to be proper with re gard to the response to the disruption of the water supply near the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage F acility , on O'ahu, Ha waii, in accord- ance with 10 U.S.C. 127, in an amount not to e xceed $10,000,000. Language is needed to provide the Department of Defense with additional authority to use existing funding available in the Operation and Maintenance, Navy account for Emergency and Extraordinary Expenses (EEE). Currently, EEE within this account are limited to $15 million whereas an additional $10 million in EEE funding is needed for FY 2023. Without the anomaly, the Department risks not being able to provide support to non-Federal entities impacted by the water contamination emanating from the Red Hill Fuel Facilities. Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Special Materials Facility Sec. ___. Notwithstanding section 104, amounts made a vailable by section 101 to the Department of Ener gy Materials F acility , Y-12: Provided , That, for the purposes of section 301 in title III of di vision D of Public La w 117-103, the \"Department of Ener gy\" table III\u2014Department Ener gy\" in the e xplanatory statement ac- compan ying Public La w 117-103 shall be applied by inserting \"23-D-519, Special Ma- terials F acility , Y-12\" after \"22-D-514 Digital Infrastructure Capability LLNL\"; inserting the amount \"$49,500,000\" in the \"Final Bill\" column for \"23-D-519, Special acility substituting \"$771,664,000\" Bill\" column for \"B61 Life Extension Program\". Language is needed to provide the Department of Energy new start authority for the Special Materials Facility project using funding provided by the CR in the Weapons Activities ac- count. Without the anomaly, the Department would be unable to begin work on the project, including long-lead procurement of electrical components and construction, preventing it from meeting critical Department of Defense weapons deliverable requirements in support of nuclear weapons modernization. Calfed Bay-Delta Sec. ___. (a) During the period co vered by this Act, title I of Public La w 108-361 (the Calfed Bay-Delta Authorization Act) (118 Stat. 1681), as amended by section 204 of division D of Public La w 117-103, shall be applied by substituting \"2023\" for \"2022\" each place it appears. (b) During the period co vered by this Act, section 103(f)(4)(A) of title I of Public La w 108-361 (the Calfed Bay-Delta Authorization Act) (118 Stat. 1681) shall be applied by substituting \"$25,650,000\" for \"$25,000,000\". Language is needed to extend authorities for the Calfed Bay-Delta Program, which expires on September 30, 2022, for the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation during 12the period of the CR. In addition, language is needed to increase the authorized financial assistance ceilings currently in place for the program. Without this anomaly, the Bureau of Reclamation may not be able to provide assistance for new feasibility studies, water purchases, and implementation of levee reconstruction activities in the Delta. Expiring Authorities Sec. ___. (a) During the period co vered by this Act, section 9106(g)(2) of Public La w 111-11 (Omnib us Public Land Management Act of 2009) shall be applied by substituting \"2023\" for \"2022\". (b) During the period co vered by this Act, section 104(c) of the Reclamation States Emer gency Drought Relief Act of 1991 (43 U.S.C. 2214(c)) shall be applied by substi- tuting \"2023\" for \"2022\". (c) During the period co vered by this Act, section 301 of the Reclamation States Emer gency Drought Relief Act of 1991 (43 U.S.C. 2241) shall be applied by substituting \"2023\" for \"2022\". Language is needed to extend authorities for two programs, which expire on September 30, 2022, for the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation during the period of the CR: 1) Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act of 1991; and 2) Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009.

Office of Health Security Account Restructuring Sec. ___. Amounts made a vailable by section 101 to the Department of Homeland Se- curity for \"Office of the Secretary and Ex ecutive Management\u2014Operations and Support\" may be oblig ated in the account and b udget structure set forth in H.R. 8257 and the ac- compan ying House Report 117-396, as reported by the House Committee on Appropri- ations on July 1, 2022. Language is needed to authorize the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to obligate funds provided by the CR in the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management, Oper- ations and Support account using the budget structure adopted in H.R. 8257 for the Office of Health Security (OHS). Without the anomaly, DHS would need to execute OHS funding from the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction and Management Division using transfer authority. Without the anomaly, manual adjustments of the obligations and disbursements would be required, resulting in an administrative burden adversely impacting DHS's mission execution, as staff would devote more time to duplicative administrative work. 18Transportation Security Administration - Transportation Security Officers Pay and In- centives Sec. ___.

Amounts made a vailable by section 101 for \"Department of the Interior\u2014Na- tional P ark Service\u2014National Recreation and Preserv ation\" for heritage partnership programs may be used to pro vide financial assistance to an y national heritage area, na- tional heritage corridor , cultural heritage corridor , national heritage partnership, national heritage route, national heritage canal way, and battlefields national historic district es- tablished as of September 1, 2022, notwithstanding an y statutory sunset pro vision ter - minating the Secretary' s authority to pro vide assistance to an y such area and notwith- standing an y limitation on amounts authorized to be appropriated with respect to an y such area. Language is needed to extend authorities for the National Aviation National Heritage Area and Oil Region National Heritage Area, which expire on September 30, 2022, for the period of the CR. In addition, language is needed to waive the authorized financial assistance ceilings currently in place for the South Carolina National Heritage Corridor and the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor for the period of the CR. Without this an- omaly, the Department of the Interior would not be able to continue providing financial assistance to these four National Heritage Areas. Superfund Sec. ___.

(d) The pro visions of this section shall not be subject to an y other pro vision of this Act. Language is needed to designate as emergency the appropriation of Superfund chemical excise tax revenue provided by section 613 of division J of the Infrastructure Investment 20and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58). Without this anomaly, the estimate of tax revenue that will be appropriated in FY 2023 would be encompassed into base discretionary resources for the Environmental Protection Agency. Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Student Aid Administration Sec. ___. Amounts made a vailable by section 101 for \"Department of Education\u2014Stu- dent Aid Administration\" may be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary to avoid disruption of continuing projects or acti vities funded in this appropriation. Language is needed to authorize the Department of Education to obligate funding under the CR formula in the Student Aid Administration account at a rate for operations necessary to avoid disruption of core operations to process, award, disburse, and manage Federal student aid. Without the anomaly, basic ongoing activities including loan servicing opera- tions, Free Application for Federal Student Aid application processing, common origination and disbursement activities, data center hosting, and call center operations will be impeded. 988 and Behavioral Health Crisis Services Sec. ___.

Language is needed to provide the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with an additional rate for operations of $590 million for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Mental Health account to support 988 Suicide Lifeline activities. On July 16, 2022 the National Suicide Lifeline switched to using a 3-digit number (988), which is expected to increase call volume. Without this anomaly, HHS may not have the resources to keep up with the anticipated number of calls. Center for Forecasting and Analytics Sec. ___. In addition to amounts otherwise pro vided by section 101, amounts are provided for \"Department of Health and Human Services\u2014Centers for Disease Control and Pre vention\u2014CDC-W ide Activities and Program Support\" at a rate for operations of $50,000,000, for an additional amount for forecasting epidemics and outbreak analyt- ics. Language is needed to provide an additional rate for operations of $50 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2014CDC-Wide Activities and Program Support for the Center for Forecasting and Analytics (Center). Funding for the Center was provided in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 which the CDC estimates will be ex- hausted by November 2022.

In addition to amounts pro vided by section 101, amounts are pro vided for \"Department of Health and Human Services\u2014Office of the Secretary\u2014Public Health and Social Services Emer gency Fund\", at a rate for operations of $132,801,000, for an additional amount for coordinating the de velopment, production, and distrib ution of vaccines, therapeutics, and other medical countermeasures: Provided , That such amounts may be oblig ated in the account and b udget structure set forth in H.R. 8295 and the ac- compan ying House Report 117-403, as reported by the House Committee on Appropri- ations on July 5, 2022.

In addition to amounts otherwise pro vided by this Act, for \"Department of Health and Human Services\u2014Administration for Children and F amilies\u2014Refugee and Entrant Assistance\", there is appropriated $1,775,000,000, for an additional amount for fiscal year 2023, to remain a vailable until September 30, 2025, to carry out section 462 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and section 235 of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, and for refugee and entrant assistance acti vities authorized by section 414 of the Immigration and Nationality Act and section 501 of the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980: Provided , That such amount is designated by the Congress as being for an emer gency requirement pursuant to the concurrent resolution on the b udget. Language is needed to appropriate $1.8 billion to the Department of Health and Human Services for the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), Refugee and Entrant Assistance account for the Unaccompanied Children program, Transitional and Medical Services pro- gram, and Refugee Support Services program. Without this anomaly, ORR will not have sufficient resources to care for or place additional unaccompanied children in shelters during the period of the CR, or to provide cash, medical assistance, and support services to human- itarian entrants, particularly in response to the increased number of Cuban entrants. Vessel Sanitation Program Sec. ___. In addition to amounts otherwise pro vided by section 101, for \"Department of Health and Human Services\u2014Centers for Disease Control and Pre vention\u2014En viron- mental Health\", there is appropriated $3,000,000, for an additional amount for fiscal year 2023, to remain a vailable until September 30, 2023, for the Vessel Sanitation Pro- gram. 22Language is needed to appropriate $3 million to the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Environmental Health account to compensate for the loss of user fee revenue in the Vessel Sanitation Program (VSP) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. VSP operates solely through user fee revenue collected from cruise ship inspections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, cruise ship inspections and fee collections have been suspended and remaining balances available for operation of VSP activities have been depleted. Without this anomaly, the VSP program will continue to have insufficient funds available to operate once the cruise industry becomes fully operational and demand for VSP activities resumes. Limitation on Administrative Expenses Sec. ___. (a) Notwithstanding section 101, amounts are pro vided for \"Social Security Administration\u2014Limitation on Administrati ve Expenses\" at a rate for operations of $14,000,945,000: Provided , That the second paragraph under such heading in title IV of division H of Public La w 117-103 shall be applied by substituting \"$1,799,000,000\" for \"$1,708,000,000\", \"$273,000,000\", \"$1,511,000,000\" for \"$1,435,000,000\", and \"$15,100,000\" for \"12,100,000\". (b) Notwithstanding section 101, the third paragraph under the heading \"Social Security Administration\u2014Limitation on Administrati ve Expenses\" in title IV of di vision H of Public La w 117-103 shall be applied by substituting \"$140,000,000\" for \"$138,000,000\". Language is needed to provide the Social Security Administration (SSA) a rate for operations of $14.1 billion in the Limitation on Administrative Expenses account in order to maintain current levels of customer service during the period of the CR. SSA has had increasing workloads, and call volume typically peaks during the first quarter of the fiscal year. Without this anomaly, these additional demands on SSA services would result in significantly longer wait times and reduced service levels to the public. Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Deferred FY 2018 Military Construction Projects Sec. ___. Section 126 of Di vision J of Public La w 117-103 shall be applied during the period co vered by this Act by inserting \"or fiscal year 2018\" after \"fiscal year 2017\". Language is needed to extend the application of section 126 of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2022 (Appropriations Act) to military construction projects that first received appropriations in FY 2018, but were previ- ously deferred under 10 U.S.C. 2808. Section 126 currently only waives the restrictions provided in section 116 of the Appropriations Act to similarly-situated projects that first received appropriations in FY 2017. Without this anomaly, the Department of Defense may not obligate funding during the period of the CR on these projects. 23State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Export-Import Bank - Default Rate Cap Increase Sec. ___. (a) Section 6(a)(3) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635e(a)(3)) shall be applied through the date specified in section 106(3) of this Act by substituting \"4 percent\" for \"2 percent\" each place it appears. (b) Section 8(g) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635g(g)) shall be applied through the date specified in section 106(3) of this Act by substituting \"4 percent\" for \"2 percent\" each place it appears. Language is needed to increase the default rate cap applicable to the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) from two percent to four percent for the period of the CR. As a result of international sanctions, ongoing pandemic recovery, and increasing economic uncertainty, borrower defaults are expected to continue to increase. Without the anomaly, in the event that defaults exceed two percent, EXIM's exposure for financing products in- cluding loans, guarantees, and insurance is immediately frozen, limiting the capacity of the agency to authorize any new transactions until the default rate falls back under two percent. Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Mark-to-Market Program Extension Sec. ___. Section 579 of the Multif amily Assisted Housing Reform Act of 1997 (42 U.S.C. 1437f note) shall be applied through the date specified in section 106(3) of this Act by substituting \"2023\" for \"2022\" each place it appears. Language is needed to extend through the period of the CR the expiring authorization for the Mark-to-Market program. This program allows expiring contracts for project-based rental assistance (PBRA) properties with above-market rental subsidies to be renewed so that the subsidized rents are reduced to market rates and the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) debt is restructured to a level supportable by the lower rents. Without this anomaly, the PBRA properties with expiring contracts and above-market rents would be renewed at market rates without the authority to restructure/lower their FHA debt. This may lead to financial distress for some properties, such as difficulty servicing the debt or covering oper- ating expenses.
