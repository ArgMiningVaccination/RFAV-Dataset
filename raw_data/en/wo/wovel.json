As one of the most poisonous toxins known and a potential bioterrosism agent, BoNT is characterized by a complex mode of action comprising: internalization, translocation and proteolytic cleavage of a substrate, which inhibits synaptic exocytotic transmitter release at neuro-muscular nerve endings leading to peripheral neuroparalysis of the skeletal and autonomic nervous systems. There are seven major serologically distinct toxinotypes (A-G) of BoNT which act on different substrates. Human botulism is generally caused by BoNT/A, B and E. Due to its extreme lethality and potential use as biological weapon, botulism remains a global public health concern. Vaccination against BoNT, although an effective strategy, remains undesirable due to the growing expectation around therapeutic use of BoNTs in various pathological conditions. This review focuses on the current approaches for botulism control by immunotherapy, highlighting the future challenges while the molecular underpinnings among subtypes variants and BoNT sequences found in non-clostridial species remain to be elucidated.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2019-09-12", "cleaned_text": "Antibodies and Vaccines against Botulinum Toxins: Available Measures and Novel Approaches [https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins11090528](https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins11090528) [Characterization and botulism consist of foodborne botulism by oral intoxination, botulism by intestinal colonization (infant botulism and adult intestinal botulism) and wound botulism. Rare but often severe, naturally-occurring foodborne intoxications are still encountered worldwide as well as infant botulism cases due to intestinal colonization by Clostridium spores. Iatrogenic botulism cases are mainly due to the increased cosmetic usage of counterfeit and poorly calibrated BoNT. In rare cases, inhalational botulism may result from accidental release of aerosolized BoNT. Inhalational botulism was initially reported in laboratory workers and more recently in illicit drug users after intranasal use of cocaine as well as wound botulism after drug injection. All of these cause the same clinical syndrome of symmetrical cranial nerve palsies followed by descending, symmetric, flaccid paralysis of voluntary muscles as well as inhibition of secretions, which may progress to respiratory compromise and death. The chief clinical manifestation of botulism is a flaccid peripheral paralysis that can be fatal in the absence of intensive care unit support. Treatment is mainly symptomatic including meticulous intensive care with mechanical ventilation in the severe cases. Anti-BoNT antibodies are the only specific treatment which is effective if administered early after the onset of symptoms [ [2](#B2-toxins-11-00528), [3](#B3-toxins-11-00528)]. Despite numerous efforts, no small synthetic molecule as BoNT inhibitor has been approved for therapeutic use against botulism. [4](#B4-toxins-11-00528)]. BoNT/E-related intoxications are scarcer than those related and BoNT/B, but the median LD50 of BoNT/E is estimated to be as low as that of BoNT/A, equal to 1.1 ng/kg in mice and monkeys by intraperitoneal route [ [5](#B5-toxins-11-00528)]. Like a few other non-proteolytic BoNT/B BoNT/F toxinotypes, BoNT/E is secreted as a unique inactive chain by group II C. botulinum strains that requires activation by host proteases. This process\u2014called nicking\u2014is associated with a 100-fold increase in toxicity [ [6](#B6-toxins-11-00528)]. BoNT has been classified as a category A biothreat agent (by the United States Center of Disease Control and Prevention due to this extreme toxicity and ease of production [ [7](#B7-toxins-11-00528)]. The Soviet Union and Iraq have weaponized BoNTs and attempted splicing the BoNT gene into other bacteria as reported by U.N. Officers [ [8](#B8-toxins-11-00528)]. Furthermore, the risk of contamination of the food chain by BoNTs has been highlighted in several potential scenarios [ [9](#B9-toxins-11-00528)]. However, BoNT is used as a therapeutic agent for a growing number of indications including movement disorders, hemifacial spasm, essential tremor, tics, writer's cramp, cervical dystonia, cerebral palsy, vascular cerebral stroke and more recently for chronic pain, migraine headache and overactive bladder. 2. Diversity and Structure of BoNTs [10](#B10-toxins-11-00528), [11](#B11-toxins-11-00528)]. Botulism due to BoNT/F is very rare, but most often associated with infant botulism, which is of importance for antibodies development [ [12](#B12-toxins-11-00528)]. A potential eighth novel BoNT, was reported as toxinotype H in 2014 [ [13](#B13-toxins-11-00528)], the designation of this novel toxin as a new serotype has been questioned due to its hybrid-like structure with regions of similarity to toxinotypes A and F and the fact that it is neutralized with toxinotype A antitoxin. It is now recognized as BoNT/FA or HA [ [13](#B13-toxins-11-00528), [14](#B14-toxins-11-00528), [15](#B15-toxins-11-00528)]. In addition, BoNT/like sequences have Enterococcus faecium and a new BoNT serotype, tentatively named BoNT/X found in the Clostridium Botulinum strain 111 [ [17](#B17-toxins-11-00528)]. BoNT/Wo from W. oryzae adds to the BoNT diversity as a recognized novel toxinotype that cleaves VAMP2 similarly to BoNT/B, D, F and G [ [17](#B17-toxins-11-00528), [18](#B18-toxins-11-00528), [19](#B19-toxins-11-00528)]). The neurotoxin gene cluster recently identified within E. faecium encodes for a novel putative eBoNT/J (also called BoNT/En) but more importantly, the public health implications and potential therapeutic use of the novel BoNT types remain to be defined [ [20](#B20-toxins-11-00528)]. To add to this complexity, sequence analysis has allowed to distinguish numerous variants within each BoNT toxinotypes (more than a zinc-metalloprotease of the three SNARE proteins (SNAP-25, VAMP and syntaxin) involved in neurotransmitter exocytosis. The LC across the vesicle membrane, to enter the neuronal cytosol upon acidification, is facilitated by the translocation domain located on the N-terminal domain of the H chain (HN) while the half C-terminal (HC) domain, for binding of the toxin to presynaptic membrane of neurons prior to endocytosis [ [23](#B23-toxins-11-00528), [24](#B24-toxins-11-00528)]. However, the molecular mechanism underlying membrane insertion of HN remains poorly understood. [25](#B25-toxins-11-00528), [26](#B26-toxins-11-00528)], triggering by endocytosis followed of LC into the cytosol. The unique BoNT properties have paved the way for neuronal transport elucidation and protein-protein interaction while stimulating basic mechanistic studies [ [27](#B27-toxins-11-00528)]. Botulism occurs when BoNT has reached the peripheral nerve endings via the lymph or bloodstream subsequently to food intoxication or intestinal colonization\u2014but mechanisms behind the absorption of BoNT through mucosal membranes have not been fully explored. The BoNT complexes containing hemagglutinin (HA) proteins disrupt the intestinal barrier by direct binding to E-cadherin and inhibition as well as many BoNT toxinotypes A lack hemagglutinin encoding genes and are produced without hemagglutinins, yet they cause botulism. Indeed, BoNT translocation through the intestinal barrier in a mouse ligated intestinal loop model, has been shown to occur via an endocytosis-dependent mechanism while BoNT further targeted neuronal cells and extensions within the intestinal submucosa [ [30](#B30-toxins-11-00528), [31](#B31-toxins-11-00528)]. 3. Current Therapeutic Anti-BoNTs Antibodies [32](#B32-toxins-11-00528)]. Two treatments based on passive administration of antibodies are also available in the USA but similarly with limited stock. The first one\u2014BabyBIG\u00ae\u2014which was initially based on human immunoglobulins, is supplied by the California Department of Public Health. This formulation has been recently discontinued and will be replaced with a new formulation currently under clinical development [ [33](#B33-toxins-11-00528)]. The second antidote consists of a modified HBAT (Cangene Corporation) with limitations due to the risk of serum sickness like other therapeutic equine sera [ [34](#B34-toxins-11-00528)] ( [Table 1](#toxins-11-00528-t001)). The CDC announced the availability of this new heptavalent botulinum antitoxin through a CDC-sponsored Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol. The HBAT replaced a licensed bivalent botulinum antitoxin AB and an monovalent botulinum antitoxin E (BAT-AB and BAT-E, Sanofi Pasteur) with expiration of these products on March 12, 2010. The HBAT contains fragments of IgG targeted against seven BoNT types derived from equine plasma consisting of <2% intact IgG and 90% Fab or F(ab')2 immunoglobulin (Ig) fragments to reduce the hypersensitivity reaction. The Fab and F(ab')2 fraction being eliminated from blood circulation more rapidly than intact IgGs, makes HBAT plasma's half-life shorter and may require additional administrations when botulism or exposure to BoNT is prolonged [ [35](#B35-toxins-11-00528), [36](#B36-toxins-11-00528)]. This occurred in a patient with BoNT/F intestinal botulism showing improvement after a unique HBAT administration but, when Fab/F(ab')2 IgG fragments were cleared from the circulation, the BoNT/F rebounded and bilateral descending flaccid paralysis recurred [ from BoNT/A in Keller laboratory by optimizing formaldehyde reaction conditions that induced higher protective antibody titers in mice compared to commercially available formalin botulinum toxoids. This study established that the protective IgG titers induced by formalin toxoids derived from the purified BoNT protein can vary greatly depending on the reaction conditions used during the detoxification [ [40](#B40-toxins-11-00528)]. [41](#B41-toxins-11-00528)]. In Japan, Japanese antitoxins have been used for more than 50 years; however, their safety and therapeutic efficacy are not clear. Indeed, published reports about botulism cases in which botulinum antitoxins were used, were retrospectively analyzed in terms of safety and efficacy of the therapy. A total of 134 patients administered with botulinum antitoxins were identified from published reports. Two cases of side effects (1.5%) were detected after antitoxin administration; both cases were not fatal. These data suggest that the therapy with Japanese antitoxins is safe and highly effective [ [42](#B42-toxins-11-00528)]. [Table 1](#toxins-11-00528-t001). 5. Generation of Anti-BoNT Human Immunoglobulins [34](#B34-toxins-11-00528)]. However, this formulation has been recently modified due to the discontinuation of the heptavalent vaccine, which prevented the immunizations required before plasma donations. The future BIG-IV formulation will be based on a bi-valent receptor binding domain vaccine to BoNT/A and /B only. The BabyBIG antitoxin reduced hospital time for infant botulism cases by about 50% but its high cost limits its wide use. The new formulation of BabyBIG will be based on a bi-valent receptor binding domain vaccine to BoNT/A and /B [ [33](#B33-toxins-11-00528)]. [43](#B43-toxins-11-00528)]. In parallel, the effectiveness and safety of another formulation of equine botulinum antitoxin (EqBA) as an alternative treatment was assessed on cases of infant botulism registered in Mendoza, Argentina, from 1993 to 2007. Neither sequelae nor adverse effects attributable to EqBA were noticed, except for one infant who developed a transient erythematous rash. These results suggested that EqBA could be considered as an alternative specific treatment for infant botulism when BabyBIG is not available [ [44](#B44-toxins-11-00528)]. [46](#B46-toxins-11-00528)]. More importantly, optimal tolerance of antibodies is the essential criterion to be considered for human application. Since it is difficult to immunize a sufficient number of human volunteers with the antigen of interest in the case of biological agents, human volunteers may be replaced by non-human primates for the construction of immune libraries. The generation of non-human primate immune libraries combined with germline humanization techniques has led to the isolation of therapeutic antibodies close to their human counterparts, which offer improved tolerance in therapy [ [47](#B47-toxins-11-00528), [48](#B48-toxins-11-00528)]. 6.1. Epitope Mapping Models [49](#B49-toxins-11-00528)]. Epitope mapping of that almost all the neutralizing antibodies are localized on the receptor binding domain of BoNTs and, to a lesser extent, on the translocation domain (HN). Blockade of the interaction of BoNTs with their specific receptors is an efficient mechanism of toxin neutralization. The efficacy of an individual neutralizing antibody may be hampered by the potential modification of its target epitope in a subtype of toxin. These limitations support the use combinations of several antibodies having different specificities to the target antigen. Combined antibodies preparations are better suited to improving the clearance of the agent since neutralization is more efficient when multiple antibodies bind the toxin simultaneously. Extending the half-life of antibodies used for the treatment for botulism due to food poisoning will also help to reduce the impact of prolonged toxin production in case of gut colonization by clostridial species [ [55](#B55-toxins-11-00528)]. It remains essential to distinguish the neutralization of the toxins by antibodies blocking specific functional sites such as binding to neuronal receptors or inhibiting enzymatic site from the in vivo clearance of the toxin from the circulation by antibodies binding to the toxin and the subsequent immune system cascades that result in renal clearance of the toxin [ [56](#B56-toxins-11-00528)]. 6.2. Epitope Mapping Based on Human Antibodies [57](#B57-toxins-11-00528)]. Native antibodies are those that arise within an intact human immune system including affinity-matured antibodies, encoded by DNA sequences that have undergone somatic hypermutation, and natural antibodies, which are encoded by un-mutated germ-line DNA sequences. [57](#B57-toxins-11-00528)]. They also applied a novel cell culture selection strategy using peripheral blood B-cells to generate libraries of stable hybridomas expressing affinity-matured, antigen-specific human IgG antibodies. This selection method followed by in vitro expansion in the presence of IL-4, IL-10 and CD40L reduced the background of IgM-secreting hybridomas, enriched resultant hybridoma libraries for secretion of post-germinal center IgG antibodies, and increased the yield of antigen-specific antibodies cloned [ [58](#B58-toxins-11-00528)]. [59](#B59-toxins-11-00528)]. The continuous regions of BoNT/A LC recognized by anti-toxin antibodies from mouse, horse and chicken have also been mapped, allowing the description of the complete antigenic structure of BoNT/A. The epitopes of neutralizing antibodies on the BoNT 3-D structure show that antigenic regions are on the surface of the toxin revealing that the enzymatic activity of the LC is obstructed when the antibodies are bound [ [60](#B60-toxins-11-00528)]. Using 92 synthetic 19-residue peptides that overlapped by 5 residues and comprised an entire toxin (A or B) they determined the peptides' ability to bind anti-toxin antibodies of human, mouse, horse and chicken. They showed that selected synthetic peptides were able to inhibit the toxin's action in vivo and that epitopes designed on unresponsive patients blocking antibodies should be valuable tools in synthetic vaccines design [ [61](#B61-toxins-11-00528)]. 7. Generation of Mouse, Sheep or Humanized Monoclonal Antibodies 7.1. Benefit of of some BoNT/A subtypes. In a more recent study, highly specific and neutralizing mAbs against botulinum toxinotypes were generated by immunization of mice with a trivalent mixture of HC/A, B, and E in a single process. A strong synergistic effect of up to 400-fold enhancement in the neutralizing activity was obtained with toxinotype-specific mAbs combinations against BoNT/A, B, and E that may possess diagnostic and therapeutic potential [ [70](#B70-toxins-11-00528)]. [71](#B71-toxins-11-00528)]. Similarly, six highly protective sheep mAbs (SmAbs) sheep immunized with BoNT/A1 HCc have been generated. Divalent and trivalent combinations of the SmAbs, were highly protective and the trivalent combination was 100% protective against experimental clinical signs and death, reflecting protective levels not reported previously [ [72](#B72-toxins-11-00528)]. MAbs are also effective for immuno-affinity purification and concentration of BoNTs from complex matrices such as clinical samples in the mass spectrometry-based method [ [73](#B73-toxins-11-00528)]. [74](#B74-toxins-11-00528)]. More recently, the combination of 3 mAbs against BoNT/A or BoNT/B were found effective in preventing botulism after an aerosol challenge with BoNT/A1 or BoNT/B1. Those mAbs combinations represent an alternative to vaccination in those at risk of BoNT exposure [ [75](#B75-toxins-11-00528)]. [76](#B76-toxins-11-00528)]. A mouse-human chimeric antibody able to neutralize BoNT/E was also developed. This chimeric antibody seems to be a useful candidate for infant botulism in which the use of passive immunotherapy with equine sera is not desirable to avoid anaphylactic shock [ [77](#B77-toxins-11-00528)]. A similar approach was used to generate a powerful chimeric antibody against BoNT/A, namely the TA12 [ [78](#B78-toxins-11-00528)]. However, while chimeric antibodies are expected to be less immunogenic, it is still possible that the rodent variable domains may remain immunogenic giving rise to an immune response. This may limit repeated long-term administration of chimeric antibodies. [62](#B62-toxins-11-00528), [64](#B64-toxins-11-00528)]. 7.2. Optimisation of mAbs Efficiency [79](#B79-toxins-11-00528)]. However, the mechanism of toxin clearance by the antibody has not been fully determined. Cheng et al. reported the in vivo neutralization of BoNT/A by mAbs in systemic and oral models of botulism. A window of opportunity for mAb rescue following intoxication was defined as well as antibody dosage and timing of administration. The increased knowledge in pharmacokinetics of the toxin and antibodies has allowed the establishment of a direct correlation between toxin pharmacokinetics and antibody rescue. A therapy combination based on mAbs F1-2 and F1-40 targeting both BoNT/A LC and HC significantly increased protection in a mouse intoxication model. The establishment of windows of opportunity for antibody therapeutic treatment are invaluable for future development of antibodies against intoxication by BoNT [ [80](#B80-toxins-11-00528)]. Moreover, protection from BoNT lethality and rapid BoNT clearance through the liver was evidenced in mice by administration of a pool of epitope-tagged small protein binding agents together with a single anti-tag mAb. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that BoNT/A was rapidly cleared from the sera of mice given a pool of anti-BoNT/A scFvs and an anti-tag mAb but not from the sera of mice given scFvs or anti-tag mAb alone suggesting the combination of binding agents with one single anti-tag mAb as a valuable therapeutic option [ [56](#B56-toxins-11-00528)]. It was also shown that PEG treatment strongly enhanced the half-life of mAbs without affecting the effectiveness of neutralization. This prolonged mAb activity is promising for rapid treatment after BoNT/A contamination [ [63](#B63-toxins-11-00528)]. 7.3. Benefit of Heteropolymers and Fusion Proteins [81](#B81-toxins-11-00528)]. It was later shown that the fusion protein complex (FP) provided the greatest benefit to the 4-mAb combination creating a 4-mAb:FP complex that dramatically enhanced potency of BoNT/A immune complexes. RBC-targeted immunoadherence is a potent enhancer of mAb-mediated BoNT/A neutralization in vivo and can have positive effects on BoNT/A sequestration, immune complex uptake, and macrophage activation [ [82](#B82-toxins-11-00528)]. Another method for enhancing adherence of BoNT-specific antibodies involved a fusion protein to link biotinylated molecules to glycophorin A on the RBC surface that significantly increased the potency of single and double antibody combinations. In a post-exposure model of intoxication, the complexes gave complete protection from a lethal BoNT/A1 dose when administered within 2 hours of toxin exposure. The RBC-targeted immunoadherence through FP potently enhanced the BoNT neutralization in vivo. [ [83](#B83-toxins-11-00528)] 8. Alternative Strategies for Improvement of mAbs Neutralization Efficiency 8.1. mAbs Targeting the LC [84](#B84-toxins-11-00528)]. This was confirmed in an early study by Adekar and Takahashi when antibodies directed against LC acted at three different sites to induce neutralization. They first acted to block toxin entry into neurons, then promoted clearance of toxin from the general circulation, and finally, protected cholinergic nerves from BoNT action. These data evidenced that anti-LC antibodies may evoke three layers of protection against BoNT that form the basis of more efficient antitoxin therapies. However, since neurons were exposed to high toxin concentrations, further in vitro studies are needed to confirm that anti-LC antibodies are specifically taken up along with the BoNT using picomolar amount of toxin [ [84](#B84-toxins-11-00528)]. The information gained from those studies could facilitate the development of potent inhibitors that prevent the binding of BoNTs to receptors in combination with antibodies inhibiting the cleavage of SNAP25 protein. However, there is little information that defines the circumstances under which these antibodies can be used. The core observation that emerged from the work of Al-Saleem was that the window of opportunity for a post challenge administration of antibodies to exert a beneficial effect increased as the challenge dose of toxin decreased. It was suggested that the identification of factors that govern post challenge efficacy of antibodies against BoNT can be used to assess efficacy of medical countermeasures against any agent of bioterrorism or biological warfare [ [85](#B85-toxins-11-00528)]. 8.2. Enhance Adherence and Targeting Efficiency [72](#B72-toxins-11-00528)]. However, antibodies targeting the proteolytic domain of the toxin can inhibit the proteolytic activity of the toxin intracellularly and potentially reverse intoxication, if they can be delivered intracellularly. To generate mAbs that could reverse paralysis, the protease domain was targeted revealing that inhibitory mAbs bound near the active site, substrate-binding site or the extended substrate-binding site. The results provided mAbs that could prove useful for toxin intracellular activity reversal and relief of paralysis as well as identifying epitopes that could be targeted by small molecule inhibitors. Liposomal \"delivery vehicles\" could be used to ensure the delivery of antibodies into motoneurons and reverse paralysis [ [67](#B67-toxins-11-00528), [86](#B86-toxins-11-00528)]. [87](#B87-toxins-11-00528)]. In addition to those findings, the presence of the region connecting HCc and HCn, that has been defined as the interaction site with SV2 receptor [ [88](#B88-toxins-11-00528)], has been found essential for neutralizing antibodies generation [ [89](#B89-toxins-11-00528)]. 8.3. Benefit of Camelid Antibodies [90](#B90-toxins-11-00528)]. The VHH has the unique ability to identify and bind specifically to target epitopes and allow ease of production in bacteria and yeast. The camelid VHH against BoNT/E was expressed and purified in Pichia pastoris. The favorable protein folding in P. pastoris seems to play a role in its better toxin-binding property [ [91](#B91-toxins-11-00528)]. Similarly, small (14 kDa) binding domains specific of LC/A and LC/B were selected from libraries of heavy chain only antibody domains (VHHs or nanobodies) cloned from immunized alpacas. A VHH inhibitor able to protect neuronal SNAP25 protein from cleavage following intoxication with BoNT/A holotoxin demonstrating the utility of the VHH targeting domains as components of therapeutic agents against botulism intoxication [ [92](#B92-toxins-11-00528)]. However, the therapeutic use of VHHs is limited by their short half-life in the blood circulation. To overcome these limitations, mouse and human red blood cells were engineered to express VHHs against BoNT/A on their surface. Infusion of these cells into mice conferred long lasting protection against a high dose of BoNT/A [ [93](#B93-toxins-11-00528)]. 8.4. DNA-Based Immunization [94](#B94-toxins-11-00528)]. In parallel, to improve the yield of induced antibodies, Trott and coworkers suggested the use of an egg antibody platform for producing materials for the detection and neutralization of BoNT/A that could provide enough antibody to neutralize approximately 11.6 million mouse lethal doses (MLD) of BoNT, but this type of platform is not currently used for routine production [ [95](#B95-toxins-11-00528)]. [96](#B96-toxins-11-00528)]. 9. Generation of BoNT Neutralizing mAbs by Phage Display Technology 9.1. Construction of Immune Libraries [97](#B97-toxins-11-00528)]. In 1997, Amersdorfer and coworkers generated antibodies capable of neutralizing BoNT/A by using phage antibody libraries. Mice were immunized BoNT/A HC, the spleens were harvested, and scFv phage antibody libraries were constructed from the Ig heavy-chain and kappa light-chain variable region genes. The results suggested the presence of two binding sites on HC which are involved in toxin internalization and toxicity [ [98](#B98-toxins-11-00528)]. In order to investigate the antibody response in botulinum intoxication, they studied the immune response to BoNT/A binding domain at the molecular level using phage display. The scFv antibodies were isolated from V-gene repertoires prepared from a human volunteer immunized with pentavalent botulinum toxoid. Epitope mapping of immune scFv binders towards BoNT/A HC revealed a limited number of scFv recognizing conformational epitopes and clones derived from a non-immune library appeared to share no overlapping epitopes with clones derived from immunized volunteers. Therefore, they suggested that a vaccine based on the pentavalent botulinum toxoid directs the humoral immune response to a limited number of epitopes exposed on the binding domain HC [ [99](#B99-toxins-11-00528)]. It was also shown that immunizing mice with selected phage clones from na\u00efve libraries elicited a specific humoral response against BoNT/A. These results suggested that phage-displayed random-peptide libraries are useful in the identification of neutralizing epitopes for the design of vaccines [ [100](#B100-toxins-11-00528)]. The use of a human na\u00efve scFv phage display library generated human neutralizing mAbs against BoNT/B and F2, promising a therapeutic lead for further development [ [101](#B101-toxins-11-00528)]. By using purified BoNT/A HC fragments as antigen, two specific neutralizing antibodies mapping different epitopes were selected from a fully synthetic human antibody library. The results proved that selecting from the fully synthetic human antibody phage display library is an efficient way to obtain human therapeutic antibodies [ [102](#B102-toxins-11-00528)]. 9.2. mAbs Engineering to Improve Affinity and Cross-Reactivity [50](#B50-toxins-11-00528)]. Yeast mating was used to affinity mature BoNT antibodies by shuffling the wild-type light chain variable region gene of the Ig. This technique provides a rapid route to antibody affinity maturation. A library of Ig light chains was generated in a yeast vector where the light chain is secreted. The heavy chain variable region and the first domain of the constant region from a mAb was cloned into a different yeast vector for surface display as a fusion protein. The affinities of one BoNT/A and two BoNT/B scFv antibody fragments were increased from 9- to more than 77-fold by yeast mating [ [103](#B103-toxins-11-00528)]. Yeast-displayed scFv antibodies generated from vaccinated humans or mice were tested for their ability to bind multiple BoNT toxinotypes. Using molecular evolution techniques, it proved possible to both increase affinity and maintain cross-toxinotype reactivity for the antibodies [68](#B68-toxins-11-00528)]. toxicity in animals was completely neutralized using a combination of serotype B and A antitoxins while no other combination of antitoxins protected the animals. In addition, BAT (heptavalent antitoxin) eliminated the toxic effects of both BoNTs, suggesting that current therapeutic treatment products would likely be effective in individuals exposed to this hybrid toxin [ [14](#B14-toxins-11-00528)]]. Subsequent studies using fully active BoNT/FA showed significant neutralization with HBAT [ [106](#B106-toxins-11-00528)]. [107](#B107-toxins-11-00528)]. In addition, a derivative of three-antibody combination (NTM-1633) is in pre-clinical development for neutralization of BoNT/E1, BoNT/E3, and BoNT/E4. Libraries of yeast-displayed scFv antibodies were created from variable region genes of humans immunized with pentavalent-toxoid- and the BoNT/E-binding scFv isolated by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) [ [106](#B106-toxins-11-00528)]. An equimolar combination of the three mAbs was able to potently neutralize BoNT in a mouse neutralization assay [ [69](#B69-toxins-11-00528)]. [108](#B108-toxins-11-00528)]. [46](#B46-toxins-11-00528)]. 10. Vaccination Against Botulism [36](#B36-toxins-11-00528)]. Thus, vaccination is restricted to individuals with a high risk of exposure to BoNTs such as health care providers, researchers, first responders, and military personnel [ [109](#B109-toxins-11-00528)]. However, CDC has discontinued the botulinum vaccine program for workers at risk for occupational exposure of BoNT since 2011 due to low efficiency [ [32](#B32-toxins-11-00528)]. Indeed, BoNTs have been introduced as a safe and effective treatment for a wide range of medical disorders preventing large scale vaccination against botulism ([ [110](#B110-toxins-11-00528), [111](#B111-toxins-11-00528), [112](#B112-toxins-11-00528)]). Minute doses of this deadly poison are increasingly used therapeutically to locally paralyze muscles for clinical or cosmetic benefit. Initially used to treat strabismus, BoNT has now more than a hundred possible medical applications including movement disorders, hemifacial spasm, essential tremor, tics, writer's cramp, cervical dystonia, cerebral palsy, hyperhydrosis and vascular cerebral stroke. Moreover, BoNT has been approved for chronic pain, migraine headache, overactive bladder and inflammation [ [113](#B113-toxins-11-00528), [114](#B114-toxins-11-00528), [115](#B115-toxins-11-00528)]. Clinical studies are currently describing its potential application in major depressive disorders [ [116](#B116-toxins-11-00528), [117](#B117-toxins-11-00528), [118](#B118-toxins-11-00528)]. 11. Future BoNT Vaccines and [119](#B119-toxins-11-00528)]. [94](#B94-toxins-11-00528)]. Replicon DNA or particle pentavalent vaccines could simultaneously induce antibody responses and protect against the 5 agents including BoNT/A, B, E, F and tetanus neurotoxin. Moreover, the reverse genetic approaches generate chimeric protein that can be effectively incorporated into virions to induce antibody response [ [36](#B36-toxins-11-00528), [120](#B120-toxins-11-00528), [121](#B121-toxins-11-00528), [122](#B122-toxins-11-00528), [123](#B123-toxins-11-00528)]. Yet, the DNA vaccination in humans still presents some concerns. DNA vaccines do not contain an actual infectious agent, whether dead or alive as opposed to the classic methods of vaccination. The risk of reversion of the vaccine are not relevant to DNA vaccines, which could potentially be given to anyone regardless of health status. DNA vaccines can also stimulate the immune response, providing a person with long lasting immunity after a small number of doses. However, there are still obstacles limiting the uses of DNA vaccines, since this type of vaccination would be limited to pathogens with a distinctive protein immunogen. DNA vaccines also present a slight risk of potentially disrupting normal cellular processes. The basis for efficacy of the recombinant botulinum vaccine against toxinotypes A and B is that neutralizing antibodies bind to BoNT complex of toxinotypes BoNT/A1and BoNT/B1 and prevent their actions at cholinergic neurons. It was suggested to verify the protective capacity of human neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccination using a guinea pig passive immunization model. Estimate of the neutralizing efficiency was established for BoNT/A1 and BoNT/B1 neutralizing antibodies obtained from clinical volunteers vaccinated with recombinant botulinum vaccine A/B [ [124](#B124-toxins-11-00528)]. The recombinant vaccine based on HC/A and HC/B made on P. pastoris has been approved by FDA [ [109](#B109-toxins-11-00528)]. [72](#B72-toxins-11-00528)]. A trivalent cocktail synthetic DNA vaccine induced robust humoral and poly functional CD4C T-cell responses which fully protected animals against lethal challenge with BoNT/A, B, and E after just 2 immunizations. These data demonstrated the protective efficacy induced by a combinative synthetic DNA vaccine and the importance of the development of multivalent vaccines that provide protective immunity against a range of BoNTs [ [125](#B125-toxins-11-00528)]. Numerous human adenoviruses toxinotypes, and a replication-incompetent human toxinotype 5 (AdHu5) have been developed as a viral vaccine vector. Those viral vaccines protected mice from a challenge with 100 MLD50 of BoNT/A at seven weeks post-vaccination [ [126](#B126-toxins-11-00528)]. the antigens to dendritic cells and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor has been shown to increase vaccine efficacy. Various approaches have been implemented to further improve vaccines efficiency such as the sublingual immunization with BoNT/A HC fused to adenovirus-protein that conferred significant protective immunity [ [128](#B128-toxins-11-00528)]. The optimization of vaccines efficacy is a key factor in providing active immunity against BoNTs to at-risk population, but also essential to obtain efficient Igs based passive immunization [ [41](#B41-toxins-11-00528), [45](#B45-toxins-11-00528)]. [129](#B129-toxins-11-00528)]. [130](#B130-toxins-11-00528)]. In addition, a recombinant host cell receptor-binding subunit designed for use as a potential vaccine candidate against BoNT/A has recently completed phase 2 clinical trials. The vaccine candidate was the BoNT/A HC with a point mutation BA15 (R1269A) within the ganglioside-binding site. The inability of BA15 to bind ganglioside shows that BA15 is a potential safe vaccine candidate [ [131](#B131-toxins-11-00528)]. In order to replace the current BabyBIG formulation, the future BabyBIG will be based on a bi-valent receptor binding domain vaccine to BoNT/A and /B. To ensure a continuing supply of BabyBIG, the safety and immunogenicity of rBV A/B was demonstrated in a recent Phase 2b clinical study [ [33](#B33-toxins-11-00528)]. [132](#B132-toxins-11-00528)]. A recombinant, full-length BoNT/A1 was detoxified by engineering 3-amino acid mutations into the LC to eliminate catalytic activity, and one additional mutation in the ganglioside binding pocket, resulting in reduced receptor binding. Overall, the engineered full length BoNT/A with defects in multiple toxin functions, elicited a potent immune response to BoNT/A challenge, validating this strategy against botulism and other toxin-mediated diseases [ [119](#B119-toxins-11-00528)]. 12.
