Some parents use this opportunity to select a health care professional, and this first visit is about establishing a relation\u00ad ship. It provides an opportunity to introduce parents to the practice, gather basic information, provide guidance, identify high\u00adrisk situations, and promote parenting skills. 1 The Prenatal Visit is especially valuable for first\u00adtime parents; sin\u00adgle parents; families with high\u00adrisk pregnancies, pregnancy complications, or multiple pregnancies; parents who anticipate health problems for the newborn; parents who have experienced a peri\u00adnatal or infant death; and parents who are plan\u00ad ning to adopt a child. Health evaluation for newly adopted children has been reviewed, with recom\u00ad mendations provided. 2 Optimally, the Prenatal Visit entails a full office visit during which the expectant parents have the opportunity to meet with the health care profes\u00ad sional. Among issues for discussion are the impor \u00ad tance of early skin\u00adto\u00adskin contact and routine newborn screening, including blood, bilirubin, hearing, and critical congenital heart disease tests. Other issues for discussion are the anticipated timing of the newborn's discharge from the nurs\u00ad ery, common health care concerns for a newborn during the first week of life, and normal early new\u00adborn behaviors. This visit also provides an oppor \u00ad tunity to provide an overview of health supervision during the first year and to discuss the practice's routines for handling telephone or electronic communication for questions, the procedure for scheduling appointments, and after \u00adhours care. During the Prenatal Visit, the health care pro\u00adfessional can review the importance of a healthy maternal diet for fetal development as well as identify any unique dietary concerns for the fam\u00adily, including any food allergies or intolerances, cultural feeding practices, and the use of herbal or complementary products. The Prenatal Visit also presents an opportunity to inquire about, and document, important aspects of pregnancy history, including potential exposures to toxins (eg, lead, alcohol, drugs) as well as to reiterate messages about healthy behaviors. Breastfeeding promotion is a key aspect of this visit, in particular for expectant mothers who have not yet decided on a feeding method or who are unsure about the benefits or their ability to successfully breastfeed. The benefits of breastfeeding for the mother and baby can be emphasized and parental questions or concerns about breastfeeding and human milk can be addressed. The health care professional also can inquire about the family constellation; the family's genetic his\u00ad tory and health beliefs; the mother's health and wellness, including her mental health, life stress\u00ad ors, status of health insurance coverage for the mother and other family members, and support systems; and the couple's developmental adaptation to becoming parents. The family's preparations for the newborn's birth and homecoming can be assessed during this discussion, as can potential safety concerns and resource needs. This will help BFG 4TH ED.indb 305 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents306 INFANCY PRENATAL VISIT the health care professional determine the avail\u00ad ability of support for the family at home and within the community. The health care professional should reach out to the prospective parents, emphasizing the impor \u00ad tance of each parent's role in the health, develop\u00ad ment, and nurturing of the child, and encouraging the parents and other important caregivers to attend subsequent health supervision visits, if possible.Before a baby's birth, many parents do not have the opportunity to meet their baby's health care profes\u00ad sional during a full prenatal office visit. However, a practice may use alternative strategies to obtain information once the parents have decided to use the practice for their primary care and medical home. These strategies can include group prenatal visits, a prenatal/family history completed by the parents, or telephone contact. Priorities for the Prenatal Visit The first priority is to attend to the concerns of the parents. In addition, the Bright Futures Infancy Expert Panel has given priority to the following topics for discussion in this visit: XXSocial determinants of healtha (risks [living situation and food security, environmental risks, pregnancy adjustment, intimate partner violence, maternal drug and alcohol use, maternal tobacco use], strengths and protective factors [becoming well informed, family constellation and cultural traditions]) XXParent and family health and well-being (mental health [perinatal or chronic depression], diet and physical activity, prenatal care, complementary and alternative medicine) XXNewborn care (introduction to the practice as a medical home, circumcision, newborn health risks [handwashing, outings]) XXNutrition and feeding (breastfeeding guidance, prescription or nonprescription medications or drugs, family support of breastfeeding, formula-feeding guidance, financial resources for infant feeding) XXSafety (car safety seats, heatstroke prevention, safe sleep, pets, firearm safety, safe home environment) a Social determinants of health is a new priority in the fourth edition of the Bright Futures Guidelines. For more information, see the Promoting Lifelong Health for Families and Communities theme. BFG 4TH ED.indb 306 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents307 INFANCY PRENATAL VISITThe Bright Futures Tool and Resource Kit contains Previsit Questionnaires to assist the health care profes\u00ad sional in taking a history, conducting developmental surveillance, and performing medical screening. History The prenatal history may be obtained according to the concerns of the family and the health care professional's preference or style of practice. General Questions XHow has your pregnancy gone so far? What are similarities and differences from what you expected? From previous pregnancies? Have you had any prenatal testing done? XWhat questions do you or other family members have about your baby after you deliver? Are there any concerns about the health of your baby? XWhat have you heard about the purpose of routine child health care? What have you heard about immunizations? XWhat do you think might be the most delightful aspect of being a parent? What do you think might be the most challenging aspect of being a parent? XWhere do you get information when you have questions about health issues or caring for your baby? How do you prefer to receive information? Family History XObtain a comprehensive family health history. A family history questionnaire can be found in the Bright Futures Tool and Resource Kit. Social History XSee the Social Determinants of Health priority in Anticipatory Guidance for social history questions.Health Supervision BFG 4TH ED.indb 307 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents308 INFANCY PRENATAL VISITSurveillance of Development What have you heard about what newborns can do at birth? XNewborns are able to smell (especially their mother's breast milk), hear their parents' voices, see up to a distance of under 1 foot (eg, they can see their parent's face when being held), and respond to different types of touch (soothing touch and alerting touch). XNewborns communicate through crying and through behaviors such as facial expressions, body move\u00adments, and movement of their arms and legs. Initially, these behaviors may seem random, but, gradu\u00ad ally, it will be possible to understand this early nonverbal language. XNewborns learn to anticipate and trust their world through their parents' consistent and predictable caregiving (eg, through feeding and how parents respond to their cries). XFor the first months of life, newborns learn to live in a world that is very different from the womb. In the womb, the baby is in a dark environment, is in a curled\u00adup position with arms and legs close to the body, and feels swaying movements when you walk. The baby is used to a small space with limited movements. Y our baby hears constant swishing sounds of the placenta and your heartbeat. XDuring the first month after birth, babies have a lot to learn\u2014how to feed well and how to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing while breastfeeding or feeding from a bottle. They also must learn how to handle the world around them\u2014the sights, sounds, tactile stimulation (touch)\u2014while learning to control their movements. All these are important steps in a young infant's development. Review of Systems Not applicable. Observation of the Family Dynamic During the visit, the health care professional acknowledges and reinforces positive parent interactions and discusses any concerns. Observation focuses on XWho asks questions and who provides responses to questions? (Observe mother's relationship with her partner, other children, or support people present during the visit.) XVerbal and nonverbal behaviors and communication between family members indicating support and understanding, or differences and conflicts. Physical Examination Not applicable. BFG 4TH ED.indb 308 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents309 INFANCY PRENATAL VISITScreening Discuss the purpose and importance of the routine newborn screening tests, including newborn blood screening (metabolic, endocrine, hemoglobinopathy), jaundice, congenital heart disease, and hearing, that will be performed in the hospital before the baby is discharged. Explain that the hospital, state health department, and the health care professional work together to ensure that family gets these test results and the appropriate follow\u00adup if any test results are not normal or are not able to be completed before the baby goes home. Inquire about any maternal prenatal testing (eg, alpha fetoprotein, diabetes [GTT/GCT, group B Streptococcus ), any abnormal findings seen on ultrasound, and any maternal conditions that may affect the developing fetus or newborn. Immunizations Discuss the importance of routine initiation of immunizations, including routine newborn hepatitis B immunization and any state\u00adspecific recommendations for immunization before discharge. Infants younger than 6 months are at risk of complications from influenza, but are too young to be vacci\u00ad nated for seasonal influenza. Encourage influenza vaccine for caregivers of infants younger than 6 months and recommend pertussis immunization (Tdap) for adults who will be caring for the infant. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recom- mends that every pregnant woman receive Tdap with each pregnancy. The Tdap is safe after 20 weeks' gesta\u00ad tion and immediately postpartum for women who have not received Tdap in the previous year. The health care professional also can use this opportunity to assess vaccination status for other children in the family. Their vaccination status not only affects their health but also that of the newborn. Consult the CDC/ACIP or American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Web sites for the current immunization schedule. CDC National Immunization Program www.cdc.gov/vaccines AAP Red Book: http://redbook.solutions.aap.org BFG 4TH ED.indb 309 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents310 INFANCY PRENATAL VISITThe following sample questions, which address the Bright Futures Infancy Expert Panel's Anticipatory Guidance Priorities, are intended to be used selectively to invite discussion, gather information, address the needs and concerns of the family, and build partnerships. Use of the questions may vary from visit to visit and from family to family. Questions can be modified to match the health care professional's com\u00ad munication style. The accompanying anticipatory guidance for the family should be geared to questions, issues, or concerns for that particular infant and family. Tools and handouts to support anticipatory guid\u00ad ance can be found in the Bright Futures Tool and Resource Kit. Risks: Living Situation and Food Security Parents in difficult living situations or with limited means may have concerns about their ability to care for their newborn. Suggest community resources that help with finding quality child care, accessing trans\u00ad portation, or getting an infant car safety seat and crib, or addressing issues such as financial concerns, inadequate resources to cover health care expenses, parental inexperience, or lack of social support. Other community groups or agencies can address inadequate or unsafe housing and limited food resources (eg, food or nutrition assistance programs, such as the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP], or Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children [WIC]). Sample Questions Tell me about your living situation. Do you live in an apartment or a house? Is permanent housing a worry for you? Do you have the things you need to take care of the baby, such as a crib, a car safety seat, and diapers? Does your home have enough heat, hot water, electricity, and working appliances? Do you have health insurance for yourself? How about for the baby? Within the past 12 months, were you ever worried whether your food would run out before you got money to buy more? Within the past 12 months, did the food you bought not last and you did not have money to get more? Priority Social Determinants of Health Risks: Living situation and food security, environmental risks (dampness and mold, lead, pica), pregnancy adjustment, intimate partner violence, maternal drug and alcohol use, maternal tobacco use Strengths and protective factors: Becoming well informed, family constellation and cultural traditionsAnticipatory Guidance BFG 4TH ED.indb 310 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents311 INFANCY PRENATAL VISITAnticipatory Guidance XCommunity agencies are available to help you with concerns about your living situation. XPrograms and resources are available to help you and your baby. Y ou may be eligible for the WIC or housing or transportation assistance programs. Several food programs, such as the Commodity Supplemental Food Program and SNAP , the program formerly known as Food Stamps, can help you. If you are breastfeeding and eligible for WIC, you can get nutritious food for yourself and support from peer counselors. Risks: Environmental Risks\u2014Dampness and Mold Explain the risks of dampness and mold and discuss strategies for minimizing these risks. Sample Questions Are you aware of any health concerns in your family related to dampness or mold in your home? Have you had problems with bugs, rodents, or peeling paint or plaster in your home? Anticipatory Guidance XSome homes may have health risks that may affect your baby. Exposure to damp and moldy environments can cause a variety of health effects in people sensitive to mold. Mold exposure can cause nasal stuffiness, throat irritation, coughing or wheezing, eye irritation, or, in more severe cases, breathing difficulties. XMold will grow in places with a lot of moisture, such as around leaks in roofs, windows, or pipes, or where there has been flooding. Mold grows easily on paper products, cardboard, ceiling tiles, and wood products. XTo control mold, prevent water leaks, ventilate well, clean gutters, and drain water away from your house's foundation. XMold can be removed from hard surfaces with commercial cleaners, soap and water, or a bleach solution of 1 part bleach in 4 parts of water. Risks: Environmental Risks\u2014Lead Exposure to lead, whether during pregnancy or after the baby's birth, can have harmful effects on the health and developmental of the baby. Prenatal lead exposure affects children's neurodevelopment, placing them at increased risk for developmental delay, reduced IQ, and behavioral problems. Risk factors for lead exposure above normal day\u00adto\u00adday environmental levels differ in pregnant women from those described in young children. Women and children with iron deficiency anemia are at particularly high risk for lead poisoning. Other risk factors for lead exposure in pregnant women include recent immigration; pica practices; occupational exposure (eg, working at a battery manufacturing plant); culturally specific practices, such as the use of traditional remedies or imported cosmetics; and the use of traditional lead\u00adglazed pottery for cooking and storing food. Lead\u00adbased paint is less likely to be an important exposure source for pregnant women than it is for children, except during renovation or remodeling in older homes. BFG 4TH ED.indb 311 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents312 INFANCY PRENATAL VISITSome states have lead screening guidelines and follow\u00adup requirements for pregnant women by physicians or other health care professionals. The CDC encourages mothers with blood lead levels less than 40 g/dL to breastfeed. However, mothers with higher blood lead levels are encouraged to pump and discard their breast milk until their blood lead levels drop below 40 g/dL. Sample Questions Do you have concerns about lead exposure in your home or neighborhood? How old is your home or apart-ment building? Was it built before 1978? Do you know if there have been any recent renovations on your house, or have you done any? Is your house near a freeway or busy roadway? Does anyone in your house work in a job that exposes him or her to lead? Anticipatory Guidance XIf your home was built before 1978, it will likely have lead\u00adbased paint. Y ou can obtain information about testing your home for lead by contacting the National Lead Information Center at 800-424-LEAD or calling your local state or city health department. XY ou can protect your baby and other young children from lead exposure. Avoid using traditional home remedies and cosmetics that may contain lead. When you store or cook foods or liquids, avoid using containers, cookware, or tableware that is not shown to be lead\u00adfree. Use only cold water from the tap for drinking, cooking, and making baby formula because hot water is more likely to contain higher levels of lead. XAvoid exposing children and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding to areas where old paint is being sanded or chipped. Wait until the work is completed and area completely wiped down. XLead dust can come into your home on your clothes or body of people who work with lead. After peo\u00adple who live with a woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding finish a task that involves working with lead\u00adbased products, such as renovating older housing, stained glass work, bullet making, or using a firing range, they should change their clothes before they enter the home and shower as soon as they return home. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should avoid activities that involve working with lead. Risks: Environmental Risks\u2014Pica The most common source of lead exposure in pregnant women is pica, or a craving to eat nonfood items. In addition to dirt, clay, and plaster, pregnant women with pica may consume burnt matches, stones, char \u00ad coal, mothballs, cornstarch, toothpaste, soap, sand, coffee grounds, baking soda, and cigarette ashes. Pica can interfere with the body's ability to absorb nutrients from healthy foods and actually cause a nutrient deficiency. Pica cravings are a concern because nonfood items may contain toxic elements, like lead or par \u00ad asitic organisms. In some instances, pica cravings may indicate an underlying physical or mental disorder. Sample Question Do you ever have the urge to eat dirt, clay, plaster, or other nonfood items? Tell me about them. BFG 4TH ED.indb 312 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents313 INFANCY PRENATAL VISITAnticipatory Guidance XEating nonfood substances can harm both you and your baby. Please let me know if you have these cravings. I can help you understand why it can be risky. XIf you do have these cravings, talk with your own health care professional. He or she will check your iron status and review your vitamin and mineral intake. XWhen a pica craving occurs, try chewing sugarless gum instead. Tell family members or friends about your cravings so they can help you avoid nonfood items. Risks: Pregnancy Adjustment Discuss the parents' feelings about the pregnancy and gauge whether disagreements or conflicts in the parents' relationship are likely to be a problem. Suggest community sources of help, if appropriate. Sample Questions How do you feel about your pregnancy? What has been the most exciting aspect? What has been the hardest part? Pregnancy can be a stressful time for expectant families; do you have any specific worries? How have you been feeling physically and emotionally? Is this a good time for you to be pregnant? How does your family feel about it? Is it a wanted pregnancy? How does your partner feel about it? Is your pregnancy a source of discord between you and your partner? What works in your family for communicating with each other, making deci- sions, managing stress, and handling emotions? Anticipatory Guidance XIt's great that you are happy about having your baby. Working on open communication with your part\u00adner and making decisions together will help you both get through the stresses of introducing a new baby into your home and family. XTaking advantage of support from family and friends and community groups can be a big help in the first few days after you get home with your new baby. XPregnancy is a time of personal growth and learning about yourself and your partner. If you and your partner disagree a lot or have many conflicts, consider contacting community resources that can help you work out these difficulties. It is important to work on resolving differences or conflicts because of the stress they may cause. Resolving these problems also can help you be emotionally ready for the baby's birth. Risks: Intimate Partner Violence According to the CDC, 1.5 million women are battered by their intimate partner every year, and 324,000 of those women are pregnant. Homicide is the leading cause of death for pregnant and recently pregnant women.3 When inquiring, avoid asking about abuse or domestic violence. Instead, use descriptive terms, such as hit, kicked, shoved, choked, and threatened. Provide information on the effect of intimate partner violence on the fetus and children and the community resources that provide assistance. Recommend resources and support groups. BFG 4TH ED.indb 313 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents314 INFANCY PRENATAL VISITTo avoid causing upset to families by questioning about sensitive and private topics, such as family vio\u00ad lence, alcohol and drug use, and similar risks, it is recommended to begin screening about these topics with an introductory statement, such as, \"I ask all patients standard health questions to understand factors that may affect health of their child as well as their own health. \" Sample Questions Because violence is so common in so many people's lives, I've begun to ask about it. I don't know if this is a problem for you, but many children I see have parents who have been hurt by someone else. Some are too afraid or uncomfortable to bring it up, so I've started asking all my patients about it routinely. Do you always feel safe with your partner? Has your partner, or another significant person in your life, ever hit, kicked, or shoved you, or physically hurt you in any way? Has he or she ever threatened to hurt you or someone close to you? Do you have any questions about your safety at home? What will you do if you feel afraid? Do you have a plan? Would you like information on where to go or who to contact if you ever need help? Can we help you develop a safety plan for you and your other children? Anticipatory Guidance XIf your partner, or another significant person in your life, is hitting or threatening you, one way that I and other health care professionals can help you is to support you and provide information about local resources that can help you. XY ou can also call the toll\u00adfree National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-SAFE (7233). Risks: Maternal Drug and Alcohol Use Any substance taken during pregnancy should be evaluated for its risk to the developing fetus, including prescription drugs, over \u00adthe\u00adcounter preparations, pain relievers, herbal substances, marijuana, and other illegal substances. Alcohol is a particular risk in pregnancy. During medical screening at this visit, if the pregnant woman acknowledges alcohol use, discuss the concerns about both neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND\u00adPAE) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) to the developing fetus. Both ND\u00adPAE and FASD have lifelong effects on the baby that can include physical problems and problems with behavior and learning. Fetal alcohol exposure, including the timing during the pregnancy, quantity, and duration, is important to document for later diagnosis of FASD. The pregnant woman should be advised to stop drinking and a brief intervention and referral for drug and alcohol counseling is recom\u00ad mended. Referrals to community social service agencies and drug and alcohol treatment programs can be provided if the mother is not already linked to these services. If the mother acknowledges illicit drug or alcohol use, also discuss state\u00ad and hospital\u00adspecific policies related to child protection referrals and practices related to child custody. The newborn will need referral to the state Early Intervention Program, often referred to as IDEA Part C, based on the newborn's clinical findings at birth and state\u00adspecific policy. BFG 4TH ED.indb 314 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents315 INFANCY PRENATAL VISITSample Questions How often do you drink beer, wine, or liquor in your household? For any response other than \"Never, \" ask the following questions: In the 3 months before you knew you were pregnant, how many times did you have 4 or more drinks in a day? After you knew you were pregnant, how many times did you have 4 or more drinks in a day? Depending on the responses to any of the above questions, the health care professional can, if desired, follow up to determine frequency and extent of consumption by asking the following questions: During your pregnancy on average, how many days per week have you had a drink? During your pregnancy on a typical day when you've had an alcoholic beverage, how many drinks did you have? Are you using marijuana, cocaine, pain pills, narcotics, or other controlled substances? What have you heard about the drug's effects on the baby during pregnancy or after the baby is born? Are you getting any help to cut down/stop your drug use? If any maternal at-risk drinking is identified, a brief intervention and referral is recommended.Are you taking any medicines or vitamins now? Are you using any prescription or over-the-counter medi- cations or pain relievers? Have you used any health remedies or special herbs or teas to improve your health since you have been pregnant? Is there anything that you used to take, but stopped using when you learned that you were pregnant? Anticipatory Guidance XThe reason we are concerned about a pregnant woman's use of alcohol or drugs is because of the effects on the baby's mental, physical, and social development. We know that a mother's alcohol or drug use affects her unborn baby and we have no way to know whether any alcohol is safe. Therefore, our rec\u00ad ommendation is that women not drink alcohol while they are pregnant. If you are drinking alcohol, we encourage you to stop. XAlcohol and drug cessation programs are available in our community and we would like to help you connect to these services. XCommunity agencies are available to help women during their pregnancy as well as after their baby arrives so that they can safely care for their baby and themselves. Y our obstetrics provider also can refer you to programs that help pregnant women stop using drugs and alcohol. XTo understand how over \u00adthe\u00adcounter medications or herbal products may affect your baby, it is impor\u00ad tant to know what, if any, of these products you are taking. XIt is important that you have accurate information about the safety in pregnancy of any over \u00adthe\u00ad counter drugs or remedies that you are using. BFG 4TH ED.indb 315 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents316 INFANCY PRENATAL VISITRisks: Maternal Tobacco Use Address how smoking affects the baby, including increasing the risk of low birth weight, preterm delivery, premature rupture of the membranes, placental abruption, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), asthma, cleft lip and palate, acute otitis media and middle ear effusion, and respiratory infections. Provide smoking cessation strategies and make specific referrals. Consider the safety of various treatments during pregnancy for patients who are committed to smoking cessation. 800-QUIT-NOW (800-784-8669); TTY 800-332-8615 is a national telephone triage and support service that is routed to local resources. Additional resources are available at www.cdc.gov. Specific information for women is available at http://women.smokefree.gov. Health care professionals also may investigate what is available in their own communities, through their hospitals and health departments and through Internet\u00adbased resources such as the American Cancer Society (www.cancer.org) or the American Lung Association (www.lungusa.org). Sample Questions Have you smoked during this pregnancy? Do you use any other forms of nicotine delivery, such as e-cigarettes? Does anyone else in your home smoke or use e-cigarettes? Have you thought about cutting down or quitting now that you are pregnant? Have you been able to cut down the daily number of cigarettes or even quit? Do you know where to get help with stopping smoking? Anticipatory Guidance XIt is important to keep your car, home, and other places where your baby spends time free of tobacco smoke and e\u00adcigarette vapor. Smoking affects the baby by increasing the risk of sudden infant death, asthma, ear infections, and respiratory infections. Strengths and Protective Factors: Becoming Well Informed Discuss the parents' support system at home and access to health information. Be ready to provide parents with trusted sources of maternal and child health information, and provide these links on your own Web site. Parents of hospitalized babies or whose babies have special health care needs may be more likely to seek out virtual networks for support and information. Trusted Web sites with accurate information can be recommended. Sample Questions Tell me about whom you ask for information and where else you go for answers about health questions. How do you decide if the information you get is something you can trust? Are going to believe? To try? Do you enjoy connecting with other parents using social media? What sites, including blogs and birth groups, do you use for networking and finding information about pregnancy, birth, parenting, and caring for a new baby? BFG 4TH ED.indb 316 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents317 INFANCY PRENATAL VISITAnticipatory Guidance XSocial media tools can be useful in building social networks, but they should not be relied on for maternal and child health advice. XThe AAP HealthyChildren.org is one resource that you may find helpful. Its Web site is www.HealthyChildren.org, and its Twitter address is @healthychildren. Strengths and Protective Factors: Family Constellation and Cultural Traditions New parents look to family and friends for support and answers to their questions about their children's health and development. Inquire about other children, older family members and others living in the home, family routines, and relationships. Anticipatory guidance regarding the infant's health and safety will vary, based on the specific cultural traditions of the family. Sample Questions Tell me about yourself and your family. Are there other children in your home? How old are they? How have they responded to your pregnancy and the thought of becoming a big brother or sister? Do you have any chil- dren or family members living with you who have special health care needs? Who will be helping you take care of the baby and yourself when you go home from the hospital? How will you handle your other children's needs? Are you working outside the home or attending school now? Who do you go to for help when you need a hand? Do you have friends or relatives that you can call on for help? Do they live near you? How are decisions made in your family? Is there anyone that you rely on to help you with decisions? Is there anyone that you want me to include in our discussions about the baby? If you are returning to school or work, do you have child care arrangements? Anticipatory Guidance XIt can be a challenge to provide care to several children at once, especially knowing and understanding the unique needs of each family member. XOlder children in the home at any age may express a variety of feelings\u2014from happiness and excite\u00adment to anger, sadness, or guilt\u2014about the new baby or your need to devote extra time and attention to the baby. Make the most of your other children's positive feelings and support their emotional needs as they adapt to a new sibling. Helping your other children feel that they have a role in the care and emo\u00ad tional support of the baby is a good way to strengthen family bonds. XIt is important to take the time to get to know your new baby and her personality. This will help you and the rest of your family learn how to help her grow and develop. XTake advantage of your support network, whether it's friends, family members, or community contacts. This network can be an important strength for you as you prepare to welcome a new baby into your life. XThe information you share with me about your family traditions and your sources of support and assis\u00adtance will help me learn about your family, its strengths, and how we can best partner in your baby's health care decisions. BFG 4TH ED.indb 317 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents318 INFANCY PRENATAL VISITMental Health (Perinatal or Chronic Depression) An estimated 10% to 20% of women struggle with major depression before, during, and after delivery of a baby. Perinatal depression has substantial personal consequences and interferes with quality of child\u00adrearing, adversely affecting parent\u00adchild interactions, maternal responsiveness to infant vocal\u00ad izations and gestures, and other stimulation essential for optimal child development. Fathers also can experience depression. New mothers may wonder why they are being asked about signs of depression. Because pregnancy and childbirth are supposed to be a joyous occasion, women may feel that they are going to be bad mothers if they are depressed. It is important for apprehensive patients to understand what perinatal depression is, to know that many women experience similar feelings, and to realize that untreated perinatal depression may have adverse effects on women's health and their children's health and development. Sample Questions Over the past 2 weeks, have you ever felt down, depressed, or hopeless? Over the past 2 weeks, have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things? Anticipatory Guidance XAlthough a birth of a baby is considered a wonderful experience, it is important not to ignore the stress that often occurs during parenting a newborn, and the life changes that come with this responsibility. In addition to taking care of your baby and family, you need to make sure to take care of yourself. This stress can take a toll on any parents' mental health and their inter actions with the child. It can affect your partner as well. XIt is common for women during and after pregnancy to feel down or depressed. Fathers can also be affected in similar ways. It is very important to address these feelings to ensure your health and your baby's health. XEmphasizing healthy life behaviors, like getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and finding time for walking or other light physical activity, can help you feel better. XIf you are sad or down for more than 2 days in a row, please speak with me about options for treatment. Talk therapy or counseling generally helps very quickly.

A pregnant woman's diet should include an average daily intake of 200 to 300 mg of the omega\u00ad3 long\u00ad chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) docosahexaenoic guarantee a sufficient concen\u00ad tration of preformed DHA in the milk. Consumption of one to two 3\u00adoz portions of seafood weekly will supply sufficient DHA. Women who are pregnant and breastfeeding should avoid the 4 types of fish that are high in mercury. These are tilefish, shark, swordfish, and king mackerel. Additionally, a pregnant woman's diet should include 550 mg/day of choline because human milk is rich in choline and depletes the mother's tissue stores. Eggs, milk, chicken, beef, and pork are the biggest contrib\u00ad utors of choline in the diet. For vegan mothers, who consume no animal products in the diet, a daily multi\u00advitamin including iron, zinc, vitamin B 12, omega\u00ad3 fatty acids, and 550 mg/day of choline is recommended. Pregnant women also should be encouraged to engage in moderate\u00adintensity physical activity for at least 30 minutes at least 5 days of the week to help ensure appropriate prenatal weight gain and to improve blood glucose levels. Pregnant women who habitually engage in vigorous\u00adintensity aerobic activity or who are highly active can continue physical activity during pregnancy and the postpartum period, provided that they remain healthy and discuss with their health care professional how and when activity should be adjusted over time. Sample Questions Are you able to eat a healthy diet? Has your obstetrician or nurse midwife prescribed a vitamin for you to take every day? Do you eat fish at least 1 to 2 times per week? Do you have protein-containing foods every day, such as eggs, chicken, beef or pork, or dairy? Are you able to exercise most days? Anticipatory Guidance XEating a small serving of fish 1 to 2 times a week provides important nutrients to your baby. Canned light tuna, salmon, trout, and herring are the best choices to give your baby the neurobehavioral bene\u00ad fits of an adequate intake of an important fat called DHA. XIt is best to avoid 4 kinds of fish that are high in mercury. These fish are tilefish, shark, swordfish, and king mackerel. XConsuming small amounts of milk, eggs, or meat every day is recommended. XTalk with your own health care professional about how physically active you should be now and how to adjust your activity after the baby is born.

This information includes the need for follow\u00adup visits within 48 to 72 hours of nursery discharge and 24\u00adhour access phone num\u00ad bers to call in case of any particular concerns (eg, jaundice, breastfeeding problems or questions, concerns about infant's intake or feeding skills, fever or suspected illness). Information about the practice policies for after \u00adhours and weekend routines and when parents should contact the health care professional should be included as well. First\u00adtime parents may need detailed information about typical early infant care and supply needs for their newborn. Mothers who have had a cesarean delivery may have additional information and referral needs. Special considerations may also be necessary depending on the number of other children in the home or if any individuals in the home have special health care needs to which the new mother must attend. If the mother is ill herself, it may limit or constrain her ability to fully care for her infant. These should be assessed and plans developed to support the needs of the infant and mother. Home health care or public health nursing referrals for post\u00addischarge assessment and supportive care may be appropriate. Sample Questions Most new parents worry that they may not be ready to care for a baby. Do you have any concerns about being ready to take care of your baby? What are you looking forward to? What challenges do you think you will face as new parents? Anticipatory Guidance XBecause your family is new to the practice, we will give you information about the practice, such as names and background of the health care professionals, staff, appointment scheduling, and urgent and emergency access information.

The parents' decision may be based on family beliefs and cultural or religious practices. If parents are interested in having their baby circumcised, provide information about methods for performing circumcisions, pain relief during the procedure, and early care of the circumcised penis. If parents choose not to circumcise their son, provide information about early care of the uncircum\u00adcised penis. Sample Questions If you have a son, have you decided about circumcision? If you are planning on circumcision, who will be performing the procedure? Anticipatory Guidance XCircumcision has potential medical benefits and advantages, as well as risks. A recent analysis by the AAP concluded that the medical benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks.4 XThe AAP recommends that the decision to circumcise is one best made by parents in consultation with their pediatrician, taking into account what is in the best interests of the child, including medical, religious, cultural, and ethnic traditions and personal beliefs. Newborn Health Risks (Handwashing, Outings) Remind all family members or guests to wash their hands before handling the baby. Remind the family to protect the baby from anyone with colds or illnesses, especially for the first couple of months. Sample Questions What other suggestions have you heard about that will keep your baby healthy? How do you plan to protect your baby from getting infections? Anticipatory Guidance XWash your hands frequently with soap and water or a non\u00adwater antiseptic, and always after diaper changes and before feeding the baby. XFor the first few weeks, it is important to limit the baby's exposure to people with colds or to large groups where people may have illnesses.

BFG 4TH ED.indb 322 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents323 INFANCY PRENATAL VISITBreastfeeding Guidance Feeding guidance will be based on the mother's plan for feeding her baby (ie, breastfeeding, formula feeding, or a combination of both) and any perceived barriers or contraindications to breastfeeding. The Prenatal Visit is a perfect opportunity to address any concerns parents have about breastfeeding their newborn, provide information, and dispel any myths the parents may have heard. A woman's knowledge about newborn feeding is significantly linked with a decision to breastfeed. Potential barriers to success\u00ad fully meeting the mother's breastfeeding goals, such as pain, worry about how much the baby is getting, returning to work, embarrassment, and family influences, should be discussed along with strategies to overcome them. Relevant information and appropriate resources should be given. Maternal history of breast surgery or implants or past breastfeeding concerns may need in\u00addepth discussions, and a lactation consultant may be a resource to provide support and answer these questions. In addition, pregnant women may benefit from attending local community breastfeeding support group meetings, such as through the health department or La Leche League (www.llli.org). These meetings provide role models and peer sup\u00ad port for breastfeeding. Mothers with a strong family history of allergies need to understand that their babies may benefit from breastfeeding through the first year of life. Mothers who are considering combining breastfeeding and formula feeding should be counseled to wait until lactation is well established (usually 2-4 weeks) before introducing formula. Discuss the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding and breastfeeding duration. Ultimately, the decision is up to the mother (parents), and the health care professional should respect the decision and understand that the mother may change her mind by the time the baby arrives. Sample Questions What are your plans for feeding your baby? What have you heard about breastfeeding? Do you have questions about breastfeeding that I can answer for you? What kinds of experiences have you had feeding babies? Did you breastfeed your other children? How did that go? Do you have concerns about these experiences that we should talk about if they will affect the new baby? Do you have any concerns about having support for breast- feeding, privacy, having enough breast milk, or changes in your body? Have you had any breast surgery? Do you or does anyone in your family have a history of food allergy or intolerance?

Do you know anyone who breastfeeds her baby? Did any of your family or friends breastfeed? Would you be able to get help from them as you are learning to breastfeed? Will they support your decision? Do you have a breast pump? If you plan to return to work, do you have time, space, and enough privacy to use a breast pump? Anticipatory Guidance XSuccessful breastfeeding begins with knowledge and information. Prenatal classes through local hos\u00adpitals can be very helpful for new parents. In addition, many communities have lactation consultants and nurses who are available to assist with breastfeeding. Having these resources available helps you be comfortable with breastfeeding and can help you get off to a good start. XPut your baby to the breast as soon as possible after the baby is born. Start in the delivery room if you can. XBreastfeeding exclusively for about the first 6 months of life, and then combining it with solid foods from 6 to 12 months of age, provides the best nutrition and supports the best possible growth and development. Y ou can continue to breastfeed for as long as you and your baby want. Prescription or Nonprescription Medications or Drugs Share information about the known effects for an expectant mother of any drugs, medications, or herbal or traditional health remedies that she may be taking. If the mother is planning on breastfeeding, provide information about the safety of continued medication or herbal use while breastfeeding. (Many herbal teas contain ephedra and other substances that may be harmful to the baby.) A general vitamin\u00admineral supplement that contains 100% of the daily recommended intake for iron, vita\u00ad min D, folic acid, and vitamin B 12 is recommended for all women who are breastfeeding. Women should also be encouraged to drink plenty of fluids and to eat a healthy diet while breastfeeding. Docosahexaenoic acid supplements are generally safe to consume during pregnancy and lactation. Sample Questions Are you taking any prescribed or over-the-counter medications now or have you taken any in the past? Have you used any special or traditional health remedies to improve your health since you have been pregnant? Do you drink alcohol, drink any special teas, or take any herbs? Is there anything that you were taking, but stopped using when you learned that you were pregnant? Anticipatory Guidance XBecause some medications, herbs, or, especially, alcohol can be passed into human milk, it is important to know what these might be so that you can be advised appropriately when you are breastfeeding. BFG 4TH ED.indb 324 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents325 INFANCY PRENATAL VISITFamily Support of Breastfeeding Most mothers are able to successfully breastfeed their babies. Babies with medical conditions that make breastfeeding challenging may still breastfeed. Their mothers benefit greatly from appropriate breastfeed \u00ad ing consultation and close monitoring. Babies who have a very low birth weight or have special health care needs particularly benefit from expressed human milk if they are unable to breastfeed from their mother. Describe actions that the other parent or caregiver can take to support breastfeeding, including cuddling, bathing, and diapering the baby. Family members, significant others, or friends should be included in breastfeeding education. Share options for engaging family members in the care of both the mother and baby. Provide information about community resources if the mother does not have an adequate, positive family and friend support network. Emphasize the need for a follow\u00adup visit within 48 to 72 hours of discharge at the health care professional's office, to check on the baby's feeding, weight, and how the mother is doing and whether she has any ques\u00ad tions or concerns. Other options for breastfeeding follow\u00adup may include a visit by a home health nurse, if this is covered by insurance, or by a public health nurse, if available. Provide parents with specific infor \u00ad mation about who they may contact with questions. Encourage parents with phrases such as, \"From our discussion, it seems you are going to do very well with breastfeeding. \" Sample Question Do you know how to contact support groups or lactation consultants? Anticipatory Guidance XResources for help with breastfeeding are available through the hospital, lactation consultants, and some public health programs. XWe will be able to answer your breastfeeding questions and help you get the support that you need to be successful. Formula-Feeding Guidance For babies who are unable to breastfeed or tolerate expressed human milk (classic galactosemia), or par \u00ad ents who choose not to breastfeed, iron\u00adfortified formula is the recommended alternative for feeding the baby during the first year of life. An explanation of the rationale for iron fortification, that iron\u00adfortified formulas are well tolerated, and that studies show that iron\u00adfortified formulas do not cause constipation, can help ensure that parents choose iron\u00adfortified formula. Encourage parents to discuss choice of formula and any proposed changes in formula with the health care professional. Review steps for preparing formula and reinforce the need to carefully read the directions on the cans. Mixing directions differ among powdered formulas. Provide written information about the importance of food safety with formula, including heating and cleaning bottles and nipples.

Would you like some guidance about choosing an appropriate formula for your baby? How do you plan to prepare the formula? What have you heard about formula safety? Do you have any other questions about formula feeding? Anticipatory Guidance XIf you are unable to breastfeed or choose not to breastfeed your baby, iron\u00adfortified formula is the rec\u00adommended substitute for breast milk for feeding your full\u00adterm baby during the first year of life. Financial Resources for Infant Feeding Parents may need referrals about resources for community food or nutrition assistance programs for which they are eligible (eg, Commodity Supplemental Food Program, SNAP , or WIC), and housing or transportation, if needed. The WIC provides nutritious foods for infants and children, foods for mothers who breastfeed, nutrition education, peer support for breastfeeding, and referrals to health and other social services. Mothers who choose to breastfeed can receive enhanced food packages, breast pumps, breastfeeding supplies, and support through peer counselors. Sample Questions Are you concerned about having enough money to buy food or infant formula? Would you be interested in resources that may help you afford to care for you and your baby? Anticipatory Guidance XPrograms and resources are available to help you and your baby. Y ou may be eligible for food, nutri\u00adtion, or housing or transportation assistance programs. Several food programs, such as the Commodity Supplemental Food Program and SNAP , can help you. The SNAP used to be called Food Stamps.

Car safety seats significantly reduce the risk of death and injury and are essential for every trip in any vehicle, starting with the first ride home from the hospital. The type of transportation the family uses will determine counseling about car safety seats. Many families rely on other family members or friends for transportation and may not be familiar with car safety seat information. It is important to explore the parents' beliefs about seat belt use and their understanding of car safety seat use for infants. The family must obtain a car safety seat and learn how to install it properly before the birth, so this visit is a good opportunity to review this information. The parents' own safe driving behaviors (including using seat belts at all times, not driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and not using a cell phone or other handheld device) are important to the health of their children. The use of seat belts during pregnancy is especially critical. Lap belts should be worn below the belly and shoulder belts across the mid\u00adchest. Sample Questions Do all members in the family use a seat belt every time they ride in the car? What type of car safety seat do you have for the baby? Have you tried installing it? Anticipatory Guidance XUsing a seat belt during pregnancy is the best way to protect you and your unborn baby, even if your vehicle has an air bag and even when you ride in the back seat. Wear the lap belt across your hips/pelvis and below your belly; place the shoulder belt across your chest between your breasts and away from your neck; and move your seat as far away from the steering wheel as you can while still allowing you to drive easily. XAll babies and children younger than 2 years should always ride in a rear \u00adfacing car safety seat in the back seat of the car. There are different types of rear \u00adfacing car safety seats. Rear \u00ad facing-only seats have a carry handle and typically attach to a base that stays installed in the vehicle. Convertible and 3\u00adin\u00ad1 car safety seats are used in the rear \u00adfacing position and later convert in the forward\u00adfacing position. They typically have higher height and weight limits for the rear \u00adfacing position, allowing you to keep your child rear facing for a longer period of time. However, they may not fit small newborns as well as rear\u00adfacing-only seats. Do not use any extra products, like cold\u00adweather buntings or inserts, that did not come in the box with the car safety seat. If the weather is cold, tuck a blanket around the baby over the straps.

Click on \"Find a Tech. \" Toll-free Auto Safety Hotline: 888-327-4236 Heatstroke Prevention Each year, children die of heatstroke after being left in a car that becomes too hot. More than half of the deaths are infants and children younger than 2 years. In most cases, the parent or caregiver forgot the child was in the car, often because there was a change in the usual routine or schedule. Even very loving and attentive parents can forget a child in the car. Additionally, some children have died while playing in the vehicle or after getting in the vehicle without the caregiver's knowledge. The temperature inside a car can rise to a dangerous level quickly, even when the temperature outside is as low as 60 degrees. Leaving the windows open will not prevent heatstroke. Because children have propor \u00ad tionally less surface area than adults and less ability to regulate internal temperature, their bodies overheat up to 5 times more quickly than adults' bodies. Parents should establish habits early to help prevent their baby from being forgotten in a vehicle. Sample Question Every year, babies die of heatstroke after being left in a hot car.

XCheck the back seat before walking away, every time you park your vehicle. Safe Sleep The incidence of sleep\u00adrelated infant death has been dramatically reduced by safe sleep policies promoted in the past 15 years.5,6 Sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) describes sudden infant death that is explained or unexplained. After autopsy, case review, and death scene investigation, a SUID may be deter \u00ad mined to be caused by asphyxiation, suffocation, parental overlie, infection, or other medical causes. The diagnosis of SIDS is reserved for infant deaths that are unexpected and unexplained. Culturally sensitive information should be provided about what is known about safe sleep environments for babies. A supine position (\"back to sleep\") is best for babies, including premature babies, because of the reduction of SIDS. However, parents should avoid using wedges or other positioning devices, as they are a suffoca\u00ad tion hazard. Room sharing is recommended, with the baby in a separate, but nearby, sleep space. Bed shar \u00ad ing (sleeping in the same bed as the parents, another adult, or a child) is not recommended. Bed sharing increases the risk of SUID. Likewise, sleeping together on a non\u00adbed surface, such as a sofa or chair, places a baby at risk for entrapment, suffocation, and death. It is important to explore the parents' intended infant sleep practices at home and to offer guidance to ensure the safest sleep environment for the newborn. Common beliefs and concerns expressed by families as justification for not placing their babies to sleep in the supine position include the fear of infant choking/aspiration, perceived uncomfortable/less peaceful sleep, concern about a flat occiput and hair loss, and family beliefs about appropriate infant sleep patterns, position, and sleep location. Different cultures may view infant sleep differently than current safe sleep recommendations. These concerns should be sought and discussed with the parents. Swaddling can be a useful calming technique with an awake infant and is appropriately used for posi\u00ad tioning in early breastfeeding. However, swaddling is no longer generally recommended and it is not for sleep. Swaddled infants have been associated with a 3\u00adfold increase in SUID when compared to infants in a footed blanket sleeper or a sleepsack. Before 2 months of age, if parents swaddle their awake infant, they should be encouraged to remove the wrap before putting their baby down for sleep because this can estab\u00ad lish a habit that can be hard to change and the risk of harm appears to increase with age. After 2 months of age, swaddling should never be used for sleep. Deaths have been reported among babies 2 to 2\u00bd months of age who are swaddled and end up on their stomachs. Tight swaddling for a prolonged period of time is a risk factor for worsening of developmental hip dysplasia. Recommendations for what is now referred to as \"modern swaddling\" for awake infants in their parent's arms are based on the principle that infants have startle reflexes they are not able to control. If the blanket is snug around the chest, but loose around the legs, infants have the benefits of swaddling without the risk to the hips. The blanket should be loose enough at the chest that a hand can fit between the blanket and the baby's chest, but not so loose that it unravels. There is currently no evidence supporting a safe swaddling technique for sleep. BFG 4TH ED.indb 329 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents330 INFANCY PRENATAL VISITParents need strategies that will assist them in engaging relatives, friends, and child care providers to fol\u00ad low safe sleep practices for the baby. A consistent message about back to sleep provides family members with the best information. Sample Questions What have you heard about safe sleep for infants? Where will your baby sleep? How about at naptime? Anticipatory Guidance XIt is best to always have your baby sleep on her back because it reduces the risk of sudden infant death. We recommend this sleep position for babies even if they are born premature or have problems with reflux, which is frequent vomiting after feeding. Do not use a wedge or other product to keep your baby on her back, as the baby can wiggle down and suffocate against the wedge. XFor at least the first 6 months, your baby should sleep in your room in her own crib, but not in your bed. Think about some strategies you might use to soothe your baby without bringing her into your bed, where the risks of suffocation, entrapment, and death are increased. XIf possible, use a crib purchased after June 28, 2011, as cribs sold in the United States after that date are required to meet a new, stronger safety standard. If you use an older crib, choose one with slats that are no more than 23 8 inches (60 mm) apart and with a mattress that fits snugly, with no gaps between the mattress and the crib slats. Drop\u00adside cribs are no longer recommended. XIf you choose a mesh play yard or portable crib, consider choosing one that was manufactured after a new, stronger safety standard was implemented on February 28, 2013. If you use an older product, the weave should have openings less than \u00bc inch (6 mm) and the sides should always stay fully raised. XThe baby's sleep space should be kept empty, with no toys or soft bedding, such as pillows, bumpers, or blankets. XThe safest cover for the baby is a sleepsack or footed pajamas that can keep the baby warm without concern about suffocating under a blanket. This also allows the baby to move her legs as opposed to swaddling, which has the potential to cause poor development of her hips and increases your baby's risk of suffocation and death. XSome babies with very sensitive startle reflexes appear more comfortable having their arms close to their body. Swaddling can help with this sensitivity. If you swaddle your baby, be sure to keep it loose around her legs, but snug\u2014not tight\u2014around her chest. To make sure your baby can breathe, leave enough space so that you can fit your hand between the blanket and her chest. Also, be sure that there are no loose ends of blanket around her neck, as these can increase your baby's risk of suffocating. XSwaddling should only be used with babies younger than 2 months and is recommended only when your baby is awake. Older babies can roll over and risk suffocation if they are swaddled. BFG 4TH ED.indb 330 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents331 INFANCY PRENATAL VISITPets Pet guidance is based on the specific animals in the home (eg, domestic and exotic birds, cats, dogs, fer \u00ad rets, or reptiles). Discussion points may include the need for maintaining physical separation of the pet from the child, introducing the pet to the new baby, avoiding contact with animal waste, the importance of handwashing, and limiting indoor air contamination with animal dander or waste products. Sample Questions Do you have any pets at home or do you handle any animals? If you have handled cats, have you ever been tested for antibodies to a parasitic infection called toxoplasmosis that some cats are infected with? Anticipatory Guidance XPets may be dangerous for babies and young children. Cats and dogs can become jealous just like humans. Learn about the risks that may occur with your pets and determine the best method of pro\u00ad tecting your baby. XIf you work with or handle cats, we suggest that you talk to your own health care professional about getting tested for toxoplasmosis. Firearm Safety Discuss firearm safety in the home and the danger to family members and children. Homicide and suicide are more common in homes in which firearms are kept. The AAP recommends that firearms be removed from the places children live and play, and that, if it is necessary to keep a firearm, it should be stored unloaded and locked, with the ammunition locked separately from the firearm. Sample Questions Do you keep firearms at home? Are they unloaded and locked? Is the ammunition locked and stored sepa-rately? Are there firearms in the homes where you visit, such as the homes of grandparents, other relatives, or friends? Anticipatory Guidance XHomicide and suicide and unintentional firearm injuries are more common in homes that have fire\u00ad arms. The best way to keep your child safe from injury or death from firearms is to never have a firearm in the home. XIf it is necessary to keep a firearm in your home or if the homes of people you visit have firearms, they should be stored unloaded and locked, with the ammunition locked separately from the firearm. Make sure the firearm is stored safely before your baby starts crawling and exploring your home. BFG 4TH ED.indb 331 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents332Safe Home Environment Discuss other home safety precautions with parents, including appropriate water heater setting and smoke and carbon monoxide detector/alarms. Sample Question What home safety precautions have you taken for your unborn baby or any children in your home? Anticipatory Guidance XTo protect your child from tap water scalds, the hottest temperature at the faucet should be no higher than 120\u00b0 F. In many cases, you can adjust your water heater. XMilk and formula should never be heated in the microwave because they can heat unevenly, causing pockets of liquid that are hot enough to scald your baby's mouth. XMake sure you have a working smoke alarm on every level of your home, especially in the furnace and sleeping areas. Test the alarms every month. It's best to use smoke alarms that use long\u00adlife batteries, but, if you don't, change the batteries at least once a year. Plan several escape routes from the house and conduct home fire drills. XInstall a carbon monoxide detector/alarm, certified by Underwriters Laboratories (UL), in the hallway near every separate sleeping area of the home. INFANCY PRENATAL VISIT BFG 4TH ED.indb 332 1/20/17 2:47 PM333 INFANCY NEWBORN VISITExamining the newborn in the mother's room within the first 24 hours following delivery gives the health care professional an important opportu\u00ad nity to learn more about the family and to demon\u00ad strate the newborn's abilities, observe the parents' interactions with the baby, and model behaviors that engage and support the newborn during this transition time. The health care professional can assess the newborn's response to voices and other forms of stimulation, such as noises in the room, touch, light, movement, being undressed, and being comforted. If this visit also is the first meeting between the health care professional and the mother, questions from the Prenatal Visit may need to be incorporated into this visit to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the family's values and beliefs, strengths, resources, and needs. This interaction with the family gives the health care professional the chance to build a medical home partnership with the family. Answering questions and addressing concerns during this visit will reassure parents and lessen the anxiety they may be feeling about taking their baby home. Knowing that the health care professional will be available after they leave the hospital will add to the parents' comfort and confidence as they embark on this new phase of their lives.Tremendous excitement accompanies the birth of a baby, but new parents also often feel overwhelmed and fatigued. During the typically short postpar \u00ad tum hospital stay, mothers are recovering from the birth, working to establish exclusive breastfeeding, and getting to know their newborns. At the same time, they are navigating visits from elated family and friends and dealing with frequent interrup\u00adtions from hospital personnel. During this time, the mother needs to be able to focus on establish\u00ad ing breastfeeding and attaching to and caring for her newborn and herself while she recovers from the delivery. The number of visits in the immediate newborn period will depend on the mode of delivery and the presence of maternal or neonatal complica\u00adtions. The duration of each visit also will vary, based on the specific needs of the baby and family. Prior parental experience with newborns, the new\u00adborn's health status, the new mother's own physical and emotional health needs, and the presence of social support influence the parents' responses and guide the health care professional's interactions with the family. New parents always ask one ques\u00adtion first: \"Is the baby OK?\" Once they hear that the baby is healthy, the parents want to learn how to feed and care for her, establish a good schedule, recover physically and emotionally from the birth, and go home to begin their new adventure.ContextInfancy Newborn Visit BFG 4TH ED.indb 333 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents334 INFANCY NEWBORN VISIT Priorities for the Newborn Visit The first priority is to attend to the concerns of the parents.

Screening Universal Screening Action Hearing All newborns should receive an initial hearing screening before being discharged from the hospital.a Newborn: Bilirubin All newborns should be screened for hyperbilirubinemia before nursery discharge or at the first newborn visit if the baby is born at home or at a birth facility. Newborn: Blood Conduct screening as required by state-specific newborn screening requirements. Know the conditions that are screened for in your state. Newborn: Critical Congenital Heart DiseaseAll newborns should be screened for critical congenital heart disease using pulse oximetry before nursery discharge or at the first newborn visit if the baby is born at home or at a birth facility. Selective Screening Risk Assessment bAction if Risk Assessment Positive (+) Blood Pressure Children with specific risk conditionsBlood pressure measurement Vision + on risk screening questions Ophthalmology referral a Any newborn who does not pass the initial screen must be rescreened. Any failure at rescreening should be referred for a diagnostic audiologic assessment, and any newborn with a definitive diagnosis should be referred to the state Early Intervention Program. b See the Evidence and Rationale chapter for the criteria on which risk screening questions are based. Immunizations Discuss the importance of routine newborn hepatitis B immunization before discharge. Verify that the mother is hepatitis surface antigen negative. Babies younger than 6 months are at risk of complications from influenza, but are too young to be vacci\u00ad nated for seasonal influenza. Encourage influenza vaccine for caregivers of babies younger than 6 months and recommend pertussis immunization (Tdap) for adults who will be caring for the baby. Consult the CDC/ACIP or AAP Web sites for the current immunization schedule. CDC National Immunization Program: www.cdc.gov/vaccines AAP 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents341 INFANCY NEWBORN VISITThe following sample questions, which address the Bright Futures Infancy Expert Panel's Anticipatory Guidance Priorities, are intended to be used selectively to invite discussion, gather information, address the needs and concerns of the family, and build partnerships. Use of the questions may vary from visit to visit and from family to family. Questions can be modified to match the health care professional's com\u00ad munication style. The accompanying anticipatory guidance for the family should be geared to questions, issues, or concerns for that particular baby and family. Tools and handouts to support anticipatory guid\u00adance can be found in the Bright Futures Tool and Resource Kit. Risks: Living Situation and Food Security Parents in difficult living situations or with limited means may have concerns about their ability to care for their newborn. Provide information and referrals, as needed, for community resources that help with find\u00ad ing quality child care, accessing transportation or getting a car safety seat or an infant crib so that the baby can sleep safely, or addressing issues such as financial concerns, inadequate or unsafe housing, or limited food resources. Public health agencies can be excellent sources of help because they work with all types of community agencies and family needs. Facilitate referrals. Sample Questions Tell me about your living situation. Do you live in an apartment or a house? Is permanent housing a worry for you? Do you have the things you need to take care of the baby, such as a crib, a car safety seat, and diapers? Does your home have enough heat, hot water, electricity, and working appliances? Do you have health insurance for yourself? How about for the baby? Within the past 12 months, were you ever worried whether your food would run out before you got money to buy more? Within the past 12 months, did the food you bought not last and you did not have money to get more? Priority Social Determinants of Health Risks: Living situation and food security, environmental tobacco exposure, intimate partner violence, maternal alcohol and substance use Strengths and protective factors: Family support, 2:47 PMBright Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents342 INFANCY NEWBORN VISITAnticipatory Guidance XCommunity agencies are available to help you with concerns about your living situation. XPrograms and resources are available to help you and your baby. Y ou may be eligible for the WIC food and nutrition program, or housing or transportation assistance programs. Several food programs, such as the Commodity Supplemental Food Program and SNAP , the program formerly known as Food Stamps, can help you. If you are breastfeeding and eligible for WIC, you can get nutritious food for yourself and support from peer counselors. Risks: Environmental Tobacco Exposure Address how smoking affects a baby's health and increases the baby's chance for respiratory infections, SIDS, ear infections, and asthma. Provide smoking cessation strategies and make specific referrals. If one or both of the parents quit during the pregnancy, congratulate them and encourage them to continue to remain abstinent from tobacco. Sample Questions Did you smoke or use e-cigarettes before or during this pregnancy? Does anyone in your home smoke or use e-cigarettes? Have you been able to cut down the daily number of cigarettes? Do you know where to get help with stopping smoking? Anticipatory Guidance XIt's important to keep your car, home, and other places where your baby spends time free of tobacco smoke and e\u00adcigarette vapor. Smoking affects the baby by increasing the risk of asthma, ear infections, respiratory infections, and sudden infant death. X800-QUIT-NOW (800-784-8669); TTY 800-332-8615 is a national telephone helpline that is routed to local resources. Additional resources are available at www.cdc.gov. Specific information for women is available at http://women.smokefree.gov. Risks: Intimate Partner Violence According to the CDC, 1.5 million women are battered each year by their intimate partner and 324,000 of these women are pregnant. Homicide is the leading cause of death for pregnant and recently pregnant women. When inquiring, avoid asking about abuse or domestic violence. Instead, use descriptive terms, such as hit, kicked, shoved, choked, and threatened. Be mindful about who is with the mother at the time you conduct the visit. If you suspect intimate partner violence, you may not want to ask the question directly, but provide a paper and pencil screening form. Place flyers or information about abuse and intimate partner violence in women's restrooms so that mothers can obtain the information in a safe and confidential manner without threat that the perpetrator may bear witness to it. To avoid causing upset to families by questioning about sensitive and private topics, such as family vio\u00ad lence, alcohol and drug use, and similar risks, it is recommended to begin screening about these topics with an introductory statement, such as, \"I ask all patients standard health questions to understand factors that may affect health of their child as well as their own health. \" BFG 4TH ED.indb 342 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents343 INFANCY NEWBORN VISITSample Questions Because violence is so common in so many people's lives, I've begun to ask about it. I don't know if this is a problem for you, but many children I see have parents who have been hurt by someone else. Some are too afraid or uncomfortable to bring it up, so I've started asking all my patients about it routinely. Do you always feel safe with your partner? Has your partner, or another significant person in your life, ever hit, kicked, or shoved you, or physically hurt you in any way? Has he or she ever threatened to hurt you or someone close to you? Do you have any questions about your safety at home? What will you do if you feel afraid? Do you have a plan? Would you like information on where to go or who to contact if you ever need help? Can we help you develop a safety plan for you and your children? Anticipatory Guidance XIf your partner, or another significant person in your life, is hitting or threatening you, one way that I and other health care professionals can help you is to support you and provide information about local resources that can help you. XY ou can also call the toll\u00adfree National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-SAFE (7233). Risks: Maternal Alcohol and Substance Use Any substance taken during or after pregnancy should be evaluated for its overall risk to the newborn, including prescription drugs, over \u00adthe\u00adcounter preparations, pain relievers, herbal substances, and illegal substances. Any alcohol is a particular risk in pregnancy. If the mother acknowledges alcohol use during pregnancy and this was not previously discussed as part of the prenatal history, discuss the concerns for the devel\u00ad oping fetus of both ND\u00adPAE and other FASD. Both ND\u00adPAE and FASD have lifelong effects on the baby that can include physical problems and problems with behavior and learning. Fetal alcohol exposure, including the timing during the pregnancy, quantity, and duration, is important to document for later diagnosis of FASD. Marijuana should be discontinued during pregnancy and breastfeeding. In utero exposure is associated with impaired cognition and increased sensitivity to drugs of abuse. 8 Data regarding the effects of mari\u00ad juana on infants are insufficient, but its use should be avoided. Referrals to community social service agencies and drug treatment programs can be provided if the mother is not already linked to these services. Newborns determined to be at risk can be referred to sup\u00ad port programs, such as a local Early Intervention Program agency, often referred to as IDEA Part C. Sample Questions How often do you drink beer, wine, or liquor in your household? For any response other than \"Never, \" ask the following questions: In the 3 months before you knew you were pregnant, how many times did you have 4 or more drinks in a day? After you knew you were pregnant, how many times did you have 4 or more drinks in a day? BFG 4TH ED.indb 343 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents344 INFANCY NEWBORN VISITDepending on the responses to any of the above questions, the health care professional can, if desired, follow up to determine frequency and extent of consumption by asking the following questions: During the pregnancy on average, how many days per week did you have a drink? During the pregnancy on a typical day when you had an alcoholic beverage, how many drinks did you have? Do you, or does anyone you ride with, ever drive after having a drink? Does your partner use alcohol? What kind and for how long? If any maternal at-risk drinking is identified, a brief intervention and referral is recommended. Are you using marijuana, cocaine, pain pills, narcotics, or other controlled substances? What have you heard about the drug's effects on the baby during pregnancy or after the baby is born? Are you getting any help to cut down/stop your drug use? Are you taking any medicines or vitamins at the present time? Are you using any prescription or over-the- counter medications or pain relievers? Have you used any health remedies or special herbs or teas to improve your health since you have been pregnant? Is there anything that you used to take, but stopped using when you learned that you were pregnant? Anticipatory Guidance XBecause alcohol is passed into the breast milk, it is important for mothers to avoid alcohol for 2 to 3 hours before breastfeeding or during breastfeeding. This also means that, because newborns breast\u00ad feed so frequently (every 2 to 3 hours), it may be prudent for you to avoid alcohol during the first several months of your baby's life. XMost medications are compatible with breastfeeding, but should be checked on an individual basis. To understand how any over \u00adthe\u00adcounter medications or herbal product may affect your baby, it is important to know what you are taking. XThe reason we are concerned about a parent's use of alcohol or drugs is because of the effects on the baby's mental, physical, and social development. Alcohol misuse can harm a parent's interaction with the baby and lead to poor decisions about the baby's care. XDrug and alcohol cessation programs are available in our community and we would like to help you connect to these services. XCommunity agencies are available to help women during their pregnancy as well as after their baby arrives so that they can safely care for their baby and themselves. BFG 4TH ED.indb 344 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents345 INFANCY NEWBORN VISITStrengths and Protective Factors: Family Support The newborn period is a time of great adjustment and change for parents. Discuss and provide suggestions about making life easier during the first week at home. Parents need support and help from their family, friends, and community. Many parents feel overwhelmed by a new baby. Knowing appropriate coping strategies can prevent parents from harming their baby when they feel tired, overwhelmed, or frustrated. Sample Questions Do you have family and friends you can call who are willing and able to help you and your baby when you have a question or need help, or in case of an emergency? How easily can you get help from others? Is there someone who can help you care for the baby? Can someone help with transportation? Is there someone you can leave the baby with? Anticipatory Guidance XIt's important to have people you can turn to when you need help with the baby. Consider talking with family members or friends and making arrangements with them so that they can be prepared to help if needed. These people usually are willing to help, but may need specific information about ways in which they can be most helpful. Strengths and Protective Factors: Parent-Newborn Relationship Skin\u00adto\u00adskin contact and stimulation is a special way of enhancing the attachment experience for par \u00ad ents and baby, just as breastfeeding does for mother and baby. First\u00adtime parents and young parents gain self\u00adconfidence and become more proficient in their nurturing abilities through this exchange and it helps to promote child and family development and parental well\u00adbeing. Sample Question What do you do to help the baby feel safe and comfortable? Anticipatory Guidance XMake touching your baby (caressing, massaging, holding in your arms or skin\u00adto\u00adskin, carrying, and rocking) an important part of all the everyday care activities of feeding, diapering, bathing, and bed\u00ad time. This physical contact helps your baby feel secure and understand that he is loved and cared for. It is a special way for you and your partner to develop a strong bond with your baby and it will help you grow together as a family. XPhysical contact also offers important health and developmental benefits if your baby was premature or has special health care needs. It can improve his sleep, help him regulate his sleep and wake times, and promote the parent\u00adbaby attachment that may have been delayed or disrupted because of prolonged or repeated hospitalizations. BFG 4TH ED.indb 345 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents346 INFANCY NEWBORN VISITMaternal Health and Nutrition New mothers need to take care of their baby and themselves. This includes getting enough rest and making sure they have adequate resources to feed themselves and their baby. The WIC provides nutritious foods for children, foods for mothers who exclusively breastfeed their babies, nutrition education, and referrals to health and other social services. All breastfeeding mothers should continue to take a prenatal vitamin containing iron. Iron and zinc may be deficient in the diets of certain mothers who have restrictive diets and they may need additional supplementation. Mothers who breastfeed should ingest 500 \u00b5g of folate or folic acid daily by taking a daily prenatal vitamin or a multivitamin in addition to eating a nutritious diet. Sample Questions Have you been able to get enough rest? What vitamin or mineral supplements do you take or plan to take? Anticipatory Guidance XGetting rest is important to your recovery after delivery. It can be difficult while you are in the hospital; you can ask the staff to put a sign on your door saying that you are resting. XGetting rest or having quiet time to spend with your baby can be a challenge, especially as babies sleep in short stretches at a time, wake easily and often to feed, and are often most awake at night. Don't be afraid to ask visitors to come at times that are convenient for you, or to ask staff members to try to clus\u00ad ter their care, so that you and the baby can have time to get to know each other and establish feeding patterns and recognize feeding cues, and so that you can rest when possible. XIf you are in pain, be sure to let your nurse and obstetric health care professional know so they can make sure you are getting the right pain medicines or treat any problems that are causing you pain. XY ou may continue to take your prenatal vitamin with iron every day to ensure adequate intake of vita\u00admins and minerals. If you do not consume any animal products in your diet and follow a vegan diet, your supplement should include vitamins D and B 12. Transition Home (Assistance After Discharge) It is important to not only assess the newborn's status but also listen and observe for concerns the parents may have in obtaining adequate support during the transition period right after the birth that may indicate the need for a referral to home care services. It also is important to provide contact information for lacta\u00ad tion consultants, parenting classes, support groups, community resources, or social services to help parents care for their baby and reduce feelings of isolation.

How do you think your baby will change your lives? Will you be able to take time for yourself, individually and as a couple? Anticipatory Guidance XY ou'll probably want to spend most of your time and attention on the new baby. Taking care of yourself, too, will help you stay healthy and happy for your baby. XHere are a few suggestions about making life easier the first week at home. -Tell family and friends about needing family time with just your baby, and partner, as well as what they can do to really help. -Identify the activities that are more difficult for you to do, such as grocery shopping, laundry, and vacuuming, now that you are a new mom so that you can ask others to help. XMany mothers feel tired or overwhelmed in the first weeks at home. These feelings usually don't last more than 1 to 2 weeks. However, for some mothers, these feelings do last for a long time or seem to get worse as time goes by. If you find that you are continuing to feel very tired, overwhelmed, or depressed, you need to let your partner, your own health care professional, and me know so that we can help you get better. Sibling Relationships Parent concerns about sibling reactions to the baby are best guided according to the siblings' developmen\u00adtal ages and responses. Behavior regression and jealousy sometimes occur with older siblings. Sample Questions Are there other children in your home? How old are they? How did they respond to your pregnancy and the thought of becoming a big brother/sister? What do they think about the new baby? Anticipatory Guidance XOlder children in the home may exhibit feelings of insecurity, behavioral regression, or, in some instances, anger or embarrassment with the birth of a sibling. It is important to support the emotional needs of your other children as they adapt to a new sibling and to help them to find a role in the care and emotional support of the baby. XTo help your older children adjust to the new baby and still feel wanted and loved, ask for their help in caring for the baby. Make sure not to ask them to do anything beyond their capability. Do not leave the baby unsupervised with young or inexperienced brothers or sisters. XSpend individual time every day with your other children doing things they like to do. Provide each of your children with love and reassurance that they are important and loved, and that their place in the family is secure.

Demonstrate the newborn's skills and his competence and readiness to respond to his parents and handle his environment. Acknowledge the parents' abilities as they respond to and care for their newborn to reinforce their sense of competence. By effectively managing stress, parents feel better and can provide more nurturing attention, which enables their child to form a secure attachment. Because families from some cultures may be uncomfortable with publicly praising the newborn because of concerns about this bringing on harm, it may be best to note these skills in a neutral way until ascertaining the parents' feelings about this issue. Sample Question How do you think your baby sees, hears, and reacts to you? Anticipatory Guidance XY our baby is already beginning to know you. See how he brightens when he hears your voice? He shows you that he likes it when you hold him, feed him, and talk to him. Y ou will soon learn what your baby is trying to tell you when he cries, looks at you, turns away, or smiles. XFrom an early age, your baby learns when he hears words spoken. Hearing words spoken by you and other caregivers will help his brain develop. XY our baby is adjusting to the world around him while learning to let you know what he needs through his cries and movements. Newborns also have to learn how to respond to all the new sights, sounds, and physical contacts, such as touch, they are exposed to after birth. Some babies will have an easy time of this; others will need your help to learn to calm down or soothe themselves. Baby Care (Infant Supplies, Skin and Cord Care) Discuss newborn supplies and safety precautions. Most babies use 8 to 12 diapers a day, or a diaper before or after each feeding. Often, this is not a supply or expense that parents anticipate. Thus, this information may be helpful in their decision to use disposable versus cloth diapers. Parents are often counseled by family members on cultural and family beliefs about skin care. Listening to parents' plans for skin care provides information about how to approach skin\u00adcare counseling. Because parents are fearful of touching the \"soft spot, \" they hesitate to wash the baby's scalp, although washing is a safe and necessary practice.

Sample Questions What questions do you have about your baby's skin care? Is there any special care or treatment you or your family provides to the umbilical cord? Anticipatory Guidance XA newborn's skin is sensitive. Using fragrance\u00adfree soaps and lotions for bathing and fragrance\u00adfree detergents for washing clothing will reduce the likelihood of rashes. In addition, oils and heavy lotions tend to clog pores and increase the likelihood of rashes. The baby has natural skin oils that are protec\u00ad tive and do not need to be removed or altered. Powders are not recommended because of the possibility of inhalation and possible respiratory problems. XAlso, because your baby's skin is sensitive, do not expose him to direct sunlight. As much as possible, keep your baby out of the sun. If he has to be in the sun, use a sunscreen made for children. For babies younger than 6 months, sunscreen may be used on small areas of the body, such as the face and backs of the hands, if adequate clothing and shade are not available. XY our baby's skin does not need to be washed daily with soap. XTo prevent diaper rash, clean your baby after wet diapers or stools and change his diaper frequently. Good cleaning and air drying before replacing the diaper are best for your baby's skin. XCurrent cord care recommendations include air \u00addrying, by keeping the diaper below the cord until the cord falls off, which will happen by about 10 to 14 days. There may be some slight bleeding for a day or two after the cord falls off. Belly bands and alcohol on the cord are not recommended. Call our office if there is a bad smell, redness, or fluid from the cord area. Illness Prevention Parents may welcome guidance about issues such as knowing how to keep their baby healthy and strategies for how to prevent illness. Sample Questions What suggestions have you heard about things you can do to keep your baby healthy? How do you plan to protect your baby from getting infections? Anticipatory Guidance XOne of the most important steps in keeping your baby healthy is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or a non\u00adwater antiseptic and always after diaper changes and before feeding your baby. Y ou also should ask all family members and guests to wash their hands before handling the baby. XNewborns are susceptible to illnesses in the first few months of life and need to be protected from anyone with colds or other illnesses. Outings to gatherings with a lot of people, including restaurants, and movies, should be considered carefully and avoided during cold and flu season. XAs long as you wash your hands before breastfeeding, you can continue to breastfeed through most ill\u00ad nesses that you or your baby have. XMake sure that you and all adults who will have contact with the newborn have had pertussis and influenza immunizations.

New mothers also must focus on their physical recovery from the birth. If there are other children at home, this is a time of adjustment to a new schedule and responsibilities. Sample Questions Has your baby been with you since he was born? How has it been having the baby with you? Have you been able to rest or get sleep? What do you do to calm your baby? What do you do if that doesn't work? Anticipatory Guidance XThe first days and weeks caring for a newborn are exhausting. Y ou and your baby have to get to know each other while, at the same time, you are recovering from giving birth. XA baby does not cry or fuss to intentionally bother us. When babies cry, it's because they need us. He may be hungry or wet, or too cold or too warm. He is adjusting to his new environment and needs your help to become comfortable. XAs you try to soothe your baby, you will begin to recognize that he may not always be consolable. Actions such as stroking your baby's head or gentle, repetitive rocking may help you calm him. XY our baby may be calmed if swaddled in your arms while you rock and softly say, \"Shush. \" To ensure safe sleep, remove the swaddling before putting your baby down for sleep. XY our baby's head is fragile. It is very important to never shake your baby because of the damage this can cause to his head and brain. XIt is normal for parents to feel upset or frustrated sometimes when there's a new baby at home. All parents get upset sometimes. When you have these feelings, put the baby down in a safe place, like a crib or cradle. It helps if you have somebody to call or ask for help when you feel upset.

It is a time the newborn is awake and alert, looking intently at her parent. Most parents gauge their early parenting ability with their success in feeding their baby. Therefore, providing guidance, assurance, and early assistance with any feeding con\u00ad cerns is a critical element of the Newborn Visit. Many parents find early feeding a challenge because of difficulties in waking the newborn and the new\u00ad born's immature ability to organize sucking, swallowing, and breathing. Mothers of newborns with special health care needs may benefit from specialized assistance with feeding and nutrition. Consider including a lactation consultant in your medical home to support early and continued attempts at breastfeeding so that mothers can gain confidence. Observing a feeding episode, whether at the breast or when bottle\u00adfeeding, often provides insight into the newborn's neuromotor abilities and the parent\u00adnewborn interaction. This examination is of value for all babies, but especially for babies who are at risk of feeding difficulties, or if there is concern about the parent\u00adnewborn interaction. The mother's comfort in feeding the newborn, eye contact between the mother and newborn, the mother's interaction with the newborn, the mother's and newborn's responses to distractions in the environment, and the newborn's ability to suck can be assessed with observation. Burping frequency varies for breastfed and formula\u00adfed babies and is affected by technique. Newborns typically lose 7% to 10% of their birth weight during the first 3 to 4 days of life. Birth weight is typically regained by 14 days of age. A newborn who is growing appropriately will gain on average 20 to 30 g per day after birth weight is regained. Newborns who have not passed urine by 24 hours of age or stool by 48 hours of age will require evaluation. Sample Question How many wet diapers and stools has your baby had so far? Anticipatory Guidance XThe baby's first stools are called meconium. The stools look greenish black and tarry. All babies should have their first stool by 2 days of age. Y ou may notice that your baby is passing frequent meconium stools, especially each time she feeds. Most babies will pass urine by the time they are 1 day old. XY our baby should have about 6 to 8 wet diapers in 24 hours when she reaches 3 to 4 days of age. She may have stools as frequently as every time she feeds. If you are breastfeeding, your baby's stools will be loose and yellowish. This is normal and is not diarrhea. BFG 4TH ED.indb 351 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents352 INFANCY NEWBORN VISITSample Question How easy is it to burp your baby during or after a feeding? Anticipatory Guidance XBurp your baby at natural breaks (eg, midway through or after a feeding) by gently rubbing or patting her back while holding her against your shoulder and chest or supporting her in a sitting position on your lap. Breastfeeding Guidance Cultural beliefs and family beliefs have an important effect on infant feeding practices. For example, in some cultures, people may believe that colostrum is harmful to the baby and that breastfeeding should not begin until the full milk has come in, or that the addition of formula offers health benefits. Explore what the family thinks about infant feeding and breastfeeding, and provide education that is tailored to their needs or concerns so that the parents can then make an informed decision that is best for them. It is important to get the breastfeeding mother off to a good start by assessing her plans, making sure she is eating healthy foods and taking vitamin and mineral supplements, and that there are no contraindications to breastfeeding. Very few contraindications to breastfeeding exist, and most need to be considered on a case\u00adby\u00adcase basis. Breastfeeding is contraindicated for a baby with classic galactosemia. Additional con\u00ad traindications include HIV \u00adpositive status (see the CDC Web site at www.cdc.gov for most current rec\u00ad ommendations), substance use, tuberculosis (only until treatment is initiated and the mother is no longer infectious), herpetic lesions localized to the breast, and chemotherapy or other contrain dicated drugs. Before talking with the mother about how feedings are going, it is advisable to determine the weight differ \u00ad ence from birth (percentage weight loss); the type, frequency, and duration of feedings; and number of wet diapers and stools. These details will give the mother specific information about the adequacy of feeding and to identify any possible concerns. Mothers who breastfeed should ingest 500 \u00b5g of folate or folic acid daily by taking a daily prenatal vitamin or a multivitamin in addition to eating a nutritious diet. The mother's diet should include an average daily intake of 200 mg to 300 mg of the omega\u00ad3 long\u00adchain PUFA DHA to guarantee a sufficient concentration of preformed DHA in the milk. This is obtained either through supplementation or consumption of 1 to 2 portions (3 oz each) of fish (eg, herring, canned light tuna, salmon) per week. The concern regarding the possible risk from intake of excessive mercury or other contaminants is offset by the neurobehavioral benefits of an adequate DHA intake and can be minimized by avoiding the intake of 4 types of fish that are high in mercury. These are tilefish, shark, swordfish, and king mackerel. Additionally, the mother's diet should include 550 mg/day of choline because human milk is rich in choline and depletes the mother's tissue stores. In the diets of women, eggs, milk, chicken, beef, and pork are the biggest contributors of choline. For vegan mothers, who consume no animal products in their diet, a daily multivitamin including iron, zinc, vitamin B 12, omega\u00ad3 fatty acids, and 550 mg of choline is recommended.

What questions or concerns do you have about feeding? Are you having pain with breastfeeding? Are your nipples cracked or sore? How often does your baby feed? How long does it generally take for a feeding? How does the baby behave during a feeding? Pulls away, arches back, is irritable, or is calm? Has your baby received any other fluids from a bottle? How does the baby behave after feedings? Is she still rooting? Or does your baby look satisfied? How do you know whether your baby is hungry? How do you know if she has had enough to eat? Anticipatory Guidance XBreastfeeding should not hurt, and pain is a warning sign that something is not right. Y ou may expe\u00ad rience nipple tenderness at first, but this should be mild. Anything other than mild tenderness should be checked. Speak with your nurse or lactation professional to make sure your baby is positioned and latching on correctly. She can also help you with treating your sore or cracked nipples. XBreastfeeding exclusively for about the first 6 months of life provides ideal nutrition and supports the best possible growth and development. For mothers who have difficulties with breastfeeding their baby or who choose not to breastfeed, iron\u00adfortified infant formula is the recommended substitute for breast milk for feeding the full\u00adterm infant during the first year of life. XY ou should feed your baby when she is hungry. A baby's usual signs of hunger include putting her hand to her mouth, sucking, rooting, pre\u00adcry facial grimaces, and fussing. Crying is a late sign of hunger. Y ou can avoid crying by responding to the baby's subtler cues. Once a baby is crying, feeding may become more difficult, especially with breastfeeding, as crying interferes with latching on. XIn the first days after your delivery, encourage your baby to breastfeed between 8 to 12 times per day. This will ensure that she receives small, but frequent feedings of colostrum, the early milk that helps your baby's immune system and stimulates increased milk production. XAround day 2 to 4 after delivery, your milk supply increases and you will notice that your breasts feel full and warm. Y ou may notice milk leaking from your breasts. If you have not experienced this increase by day 5, let me know. XAt about 3 to 4 days after birth, babies will often increase the frequency and length of their feedings. They often want to breastfeed very frequently. This is when babies begin to gain weight. They should be back to their birth weight by about 2 weeks of age. As your baby breastfeeds more, you will see your milk supply increase to meet your baby's needs. XAt about 1 week of age, your baby should feed every 1 to 3 hours in the daytime, and every 3 hours at night with one longer 4\u00ad to 5\u00adhour stretch between feedings. For the first few weeks, your baby should breastfeed between 8 to 12 times in 24 hours. XFeed your baby until she seems full. Signs of fullness are gently releasing the nipple, closing the mouth, and relaxing the hands. If she is sleeping more than 4 hours at a time during the first 2 weeks, she should be awakened for feeding. Keeping her close by rooming\u00adin while in the hospital and at home will make it easier for you to recognize her early feeding cues. XA newborn is usually very alert for the first 3 to 4 hours after delivery, and then is typically sleepy for the rest of the first day. She may need gentle stimulation (such as rocking, patting, or stroking or undressing) and time to come to an alert state for feeding. These movements also are helpful for con\u00ad soling your baby.

It is not necessary to give your baby anything other than your breast milk unless there is a medical reason. Formula-Feeding Guidance If a woman is unable or chooses not to breastfeed, a cow's milk-based, iron\u00adfortified infant formula is the recommended substitute for feeding the full\u00adterm infant for the first year of life. Information regarding formula preparation and storage, formula safety, infant holding, and burping should be provided by the birthing hospital staff as part of the routine infant care to ensure safe and appropriate formula preparation and feeding. Sample Questions What formula are you planning to use? What do you know about preparing formula and keeping formula safe? How often does your baby feed? How much does your baby take at a feeding? How long does it take to complete a feeding? How does your baby like to be held when you feed her? Are you able to get the baby to burp during or at the end of a feeding? Is the baby falling asleep while you feed her? Anticipatory Guidance XCarefully read the instructions on the formula can. It will give you important information about how to prepare the formula and store it safely. The nurses will review how to safely prepare the baby's milk before you go home from the hospital. Talk with me or another health care professional if you have any questions about how to prepare formula or before switching to a different brand or kind of formula. XChoose plastic bottles made from new, safer plastics or tempered glass baby bottles. XNever heat a bottle in a microwave. If you wish to warm a bottle, a hot water bath is recommended. XFormula\u00adfed babies should be fed on cue, usually at least 8 times in 24 hours. The baby's stomach size increases after birth over the first few days. Newborns will typically take \u00bd to 1 oz per feeding in the first day or 2, and then gradually increase to 1 to 1\u00bd oz by day 2 to 4. Take care not to overfeed your baby. XBecause formula is expensive, you may be hesitant to throw away any that is left in the bottle. For food safety reasons, if your baby has not taken all of the formula at one feeding, you may use it for the next feeding, but be sure to put it back in the refrigerator. Do not mix this formula with new formula. If the formula has been heated and has been out of the refrigerator for 1 hour or more, discard it. XDo not cut bottle nipples or make the holes larger to increase the amount of formula the baby receives or to speed up feeding times. XAs your baby's appetite increases over time, you will need to prepare and offer larger quantities of formula. XIt is important for you to always hold your baby close when feeding, in a semi\u00adupright position, so that you are able to sense her behavioral cues of hunger, being full, comfort, and distress. Hold your baby so you can look into her eyes during feeding. XWhen you feed your baby with a bottle, do not prop the bottle in her mouth. Propping increases the risk that she may choke, get an ear infection, and develop early tooth decay. Holding your baby in your arms and holding the bottle for her gives you a wonderful opportunity for warm and loving interaction with her.

Car safety seats significantly reduce the risk of death and injury and are essential for every trip in any vehicle, starting with the first ride home from the hospital. The type of transportation the family uses will determine counseling about car safety seats. Many families rely on other family members or friends for transportation and may not be familiar with car safety seat information. It is important to explore the parents' beliefs about seat belt use and their understanding of car safety seat use for infants. The family should have obtained a car safety seat and learned how to install it properly before the birth, so this visit is a good opportunity to check that the family is prepared and knows how to transport the baby safely. If the baby is born preterm, less than 37' weeks gestation, or is at risk of cardiorespiratory compromise (neurologic impairment, craniofacial anomalies affecting breathing, severe cardiac or pulmonary disease), it is important to ensure that a car safety seat tolerance screening will be performed before the baby is discharged from the hospital. The screening will determine if the baby needs any special precautions during travel or while positioned in the infant seat. For all babies, car safety seats should be used only for travel, not for sleep or positioning outside the vehicle. The parents' own safe driving behaviors (including using seat belts at all times, not driving under the influ\u00ad ence of alcohol or drugs, and not using a cell phone or other handheld device) are important to the health of their children. Sample Questions Do all members in the family use a seat belt every time they ride in the car? What type of car safety seat do you have for the baby? Have you tried installing it? Anticipatory Guidance XAll babies and children younger than 2 years should always ride in a rear \u00adfacing car safety seat in the back seat of the car. There are different types of rear \u00adfacing car safety seats: rear \u00adfacing-only seats have a carry handle and typically attach to a base that stays installed in the vehicle. Convertible and 3\u00adin\u00ad1 car safety seats are used rear facing and later convert to forward facing; they typically have higher height and weight limits for the rear \u00adfacing position, allowing you to keep your child rear facing for a longer period of time. However, they may not fit small newborns as well as rear \u00adfacing-only seats. Do not use any extra products, like cold\u00adweather buntings or inserts, that did not come in the box with the car safety seat.

More than half of the deaths are children younger than 2 years. In most cases, the parent or caregiver forgot the child was in the car, often because there was a change in the usual routine or schedule. Even very loving and attentive parents can forget a child in the car. Additionally, some children have died while playing in the vehicle or after getting in the vehicle without the caregiver's knowledge. The temperature inside a car can rise to a dangerous level quickly, even when the temperature outside is as low as 60 degrees. Leaving the windows open will not prevent heatstroke. Because children have propor \u00ad tionally less surface area than adults and less ability to regulate internal temperature, their bodies overheat up to 5 times more quickly than adults' bodies. Parents should establish habits early to help prevent their child from being forgotten in a vehicle. Sample Question Every year, children die of heatstroke after being left in a hot car. Would you like to talk about creating a plan so this doesn't happen to you? Anticipatory Guidance XNever leave your child alone in a car for any reason, even briefly. XStart developing habits that will help prevent you from ever forgetting your baby in the car. Consider putting an item that you need, like your purse, cell phone, or employee ID, in the back seat of the vehicle, so you will see the child when you retrieve the item before leaving the car.

BFG 4TH ED.indb 356 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents357 INFANCY NEWBORN VISITSafe Sleep Culturally sensitive information should be provided about what is known about safe\u00adsleep environments for babies. A supine position is best for babies, including premature babies, because it reduces the risk of SIDS. However, parents should avoid using wedges or other positioning devices, as they are a suffocation hazard. Room sharing is recommended, with the baby in a separate, but nearby, sleep space. Bed sharing (sleeping in the same bed as the parents, another adult, or a child) increases the risk of SUID. Parents should never bed share or sleep with their baby in a chair or on a couch. Bed sharing is not required for successful breastfeeding and the clinician can share other approaches for soothing the baby other than putting the baby in their bed. It is important to explore the parents' intended infant sleep practices at home and to offer guidance to ensure the safest sleep environment for the newborn. Common beliefs and concerns expressed by families as justification for not placing their babies to sleep in the supine position include the fear of infant choking or aspiration, perceived uncomfortable or less peaceful sleep, concern about a flat occiput and hair loss, and family beliefs about appropriate infant sleep patterns, position, and sleep location. Different cultures may view infant sleep differently than current safe sleep recommendations. These concerns should be sought and discussed with the parents. Swaddling can be a useful calming technique with an awake infant and is appropriately used for posi\u00ad tioning in early breastfeeding. However, swaddling is no longer generally recommended and it is not for sleep. Swaddled infants have been associated with a 3\u00adfold increase in SUID when compared to infants in a footed blanket sleeper or a sleepsack. Before 2 months of age, if parents swaddle their awake infant, they should be encouraged to remove the wrap before putting their baby down because this can establish a habit that can be hard to change and the risk of harm appears to increase with age. After 2 months of age, swaddling should never be used for sleep. Deaths have been reported among babies 2 to 2\u00bd months of age who are swaddled and end up on their stomachs. Tight swaddling for a prolonged period of time is a risk factor for worsening of developmental hip dysplasia. Recommendations for what is now referred to as \"modern swaddling\" for awake babies in their parent's arms are based on the principle that babies have startle reflexes they are not able to control. If the blanket is snug around the chest, but loose around the legs, babies have the benefits of swaddling without the risk to the hips. The blanket should be loose enough at the chest that a hand can fit between the blanket and the baby's chest, but not so loose that it unravels. There is currently no evidence supporting a safe swaddling technique for sleep. Parents need strategies that will assist them in engaging relatives, friends, and child care providers to fol\u00ad low safe sleep practices for the baby. A consistent message about \"back to sleep\" provides family members with the best information. Sample Questions What have you heard about how babies should sleep? Where will your baby sleep?

BFG 4TH ED.indb 357 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents358 INFANCY NEWBORN VISITAnticipatory Guidance XIt is best to always have your baby sleep on his back because it reduces the risk of sudden death. We recommend this sleep position for babies even if they are born premature or have problems with reflux, which is frequent vomiting after feeding. Do not use a wedge or other product to keep your baby on his back, as he can wiggle down and suffocate against the wedge. XY our baby should sleep in your room in his own crib, but not in your bed. Think about some strategies you might use to soothe your baby without bringing him into your bed, where the risks of suffocation, entrapment, and death are increased. XIf possible, use a crib purchased after June 28, 2011, as cribs sold in the United States after that date are required to meet a new, stronger safety standard. If you use an older crib, choose one with slats that are no more than 23 8 inches (60 mm) apart and with a mattress that fits snugly, with no gaps between the mattress and the crib slats. Drop\u00adside cribs are no longer recommended. XIf you choose a mesh play yard or portable crib, consider choosing one that was manufactured after a new, stronger safety standard was implemented on February 28, 2013. If you use an older product, the weave should have openings less than \u00bc inch (6 mm) and the sides should always stay fully raised. XThe baby's sleep space should be kept empty, with no toys or soft bedding, such as pillows, bumpers, or blankets. XThe safest cover for the baby is a sleepsack or footed pajamas that can keep him warm without concern about suffocating under a blanket. This also allows the baby to move his legs, as opposed to swaddling, which has the potential to cause poor development of his hips and increases his risk of suffocation and death. XNewborn sleeping patterns may be different from one baby to another. Usually, in the first few weeks, the baby's pattern may vary from day to day, but most babies will sleep 16 to 20 hours out of 24. They may wake and need to be fed as often as every 1 to 2 hours and often have one period when they sleep for 3 to 4 hours. Pets Pet guidance is based on the specific animals in the home (eg, domestic and exotic birds, cats, dogs, fer \u00ad rets, or reptiles). Discussion points may include the need for maintaining physical separation of the pet from the baby, introducing the pet to the new baby, avoiding contact with animal waste, the importance of handwashing, and limiting indoor air contamination with animal dander or waste products. Sample Question Do you have any pets at home or do you handle any animals? Anticipatory Guidance XPets may be dangerous for infants and young children. Cats and dogs can become jealous just like humans. Learn about the risks that may occur with your pets and determine the best method of pro\u00ad tecting your baby.

Sample Question What home safety precautions have you taken for your baby and any other children in your home? Anticipatory Guidance XTo protect your child from tap water scalds, the hottest temperature at the faucet should be no higher than 120\u00b0F. In many cases, you can adjust your water heater. XIf you bathe your baby in the kitchen sink, do not run the dishwasher at the same time. Hot water from the dishwasher can come up the sink drain and scald the baby. XMilk and formula should not be heated in the microwave because they can heat unevenly, causing pockets of liquid that are hot enough to scald your baby's mouth. XMake sure you have a working smoke alarm on every level of your home, especially in the furnace and sleeping areas. Test the alarms every month. It's best to use smoke alarms that use long\u00adlife batteries, but, if you don't, change the batteries at least once a year. Plan several escape routes from the house and conduct home fire drills. XInstall a UL \u00adcertified carbon monoxide detector/alarm in the hallway near every separate sleeping area of the home. BFG 4TH FIRST WEEK VISIT (3 TO 5 DAYS)Families need a clear plan, tailored to their indi\u00ad vidual needs, for continuing care of their newborn. Current recommendations for timing the initial post\u00adnursery continuing care visit are based on the known health risks for a newborn during the first week of life\u2014jaundice, feeding difficulties, hydra\u00adtion problems that cause excessive weight loss, sus\u00adpected sepsis, and detection of serious congenital malformations that were not apparent on the initial examinations, but became symptomatic during the first weeks of life. A follow\u00adup visit should, there\u00ad fore, occur within 3 to 5 days after birth and within 48 to 72 hours after discharge. Early discharge at 48 hours or less after delivery may be appropriate following the normal vaginal birth of a healthy, full\u00adterm newborn (39-406 7 weeks' gestation). Late preterm newborns, defined as 340 7 to 366 7 weeks' gestation, typically require a longer hospitalization. These younger newborns have higher rates of neonatal complications and adverse outcomes when compared with the full\u00ad term newborn. In this younger group, the likeli\u00ad hood is greater within the first 2 weeks of life for neonatal morbidities. These include respiratory distress, difficulties with feeding, problems with glucose homeostasis and temperature regula \u00ad tion, suspected sepsis, and severe hyperbiliru\u00adbinemia requiring specialized newborn care or rehospitalization. Despite recommendations and evidence supporting the utility of follow\u00adup care within the first week of life for newborns discharged within 48 hours of birth, most of these newborns are not receiving timely post\u00addischarge follow\u00adup care. Early follow \u00ad up care may not be feasible in some rural commu\u00adnities and adherence may be poor among families who do not have a previously established medical home. Health care professionals may use a variety of approaches (both office\u00adbased and home visits conducted by a hospital home health program, pub\u00adlic health nurse, or community outreach worker) to ensure follow\u00adup care within the first week of life. The recommendation for babies delivered by cesarean delivery and whose hospital stay is 96 hours or longer is for a first office visit up t o a week after discharge. The exact timing of this visit depends on the specific issues, health concerns, and needs of the baby and mother. Potential risks to consider at the First Week Visit (3 to 5 Days) include prematurity, risk factors for severe hyperbilirubinemia (blood group incom\u00adpatibility or other causes of neonatal hemolytic anemia), bruising, cephalohematoma, maternal conditions that may affect the newborn (maternal diabetes, thyroid disease, substance/psychotropic medication use), as well as breastfeeding difficul\u00adties or problems with feeding or state regulation (alertness, orientation, and regulatory capacity). Assessment for perinatal depression and observa\u00ad tion of parent\u00adnewborn interactions are additional aspects of importance to this visit. The completion of routine newborn screening, including blood, bilirubin, hearing, and critical congenital heart disease tests, needs to be confirmed, available results reviewed, and plans made for com\u00ad munication with the family for pending results.

Appropriate specialty referral or consultation must be arranged promptly for babies with special health care needs. Mothers and families who have expe\u00ad rienced a perinatal complication or the need for specialized newborn care require extra attention, as they may experience depression, anxiety, guilt, a sense of loss of control, reduced satisfaction with the birth experience, and even loss of self\u00adesteem. Family members may need extra support to resolve their feelings and additional time to understand their newborn's condition and appreciate their newborn's unique characteristics and strengths rather than only the newborn's special needs. Priorities for the First Week Visit (3 to 5 Days) The first priority is to attend to the concerns of the parents. In addition, the Bright Futures Infancy Expert Panel has given priority to the following topics for discussion in this visit: XXSocial determinants of healtha (risks [living situation and food security, environmental tobacco exposure], strengths and protective factors [family support]) XXParent and family health and well-being (transition home, sibling adjustment) XXNewborn behavior and care (early brain development, adjustment to home, calming, when to call [temperature taking] and emergency readiness, CPR, illness prevention [handwashing, outings] and sun exposure) XXNutrition and feeding (general guidance on feeding [weight gain, feeding strategies, holding, burping, hunger and satiation cues], breastfeeding guidance, formula-feeding guidance) XXSafety (car safety seats, heatstroke prevention, safe sleep, safe home environment: burns) a Social determinants of health is a new priority in the fourth edition of the Bright Futures Guidelines.

Immunizations Provide hepatitis B vaccine, if not administered during the newborn stay. Verify that the mother is hepati\u00ad tis surface antigen negative. Babies younger than 6 months are at risk of complications from influenza, but are too young to be vacci\u00ad nated for seasonal influenza. Encourage influenza vaccine for caregivers of babies younger than 6 months and recommend pertussis immunization (Tdap) for adults who will be caring for the baby. Review the immunization status of siblings in the home. Consult the CDC/ACIP or AAP Web sites for the current immunization schedule.

Use of the questions may vary from visit to visit and from family to family. Questions can be modified to match the health care professional's com\u00ad munication style. The accompanying anticipatory guidance for the family should be geared to questions, issues, or concerns for that particular infant and family. Tools and handouts to support anticipatory guid\u00adance can be found in the Bright Futures Tool and Resource Kit. Risks: Living Situation and Food Security Probe for stressors, such as return to work or school or the inability to return to work or school, competing family needs, or loss of social or financial support. Provide guidance, referrals, and help in connecting with community resources as needed. Suggest community resources that help with finding quality child care, accessing transportation or getting an infant car safety seat and crib, or addressing issues such as financial concerns, inadequate means to cover health care expenses, inadequate or unsafe housing, parental inexperience, or lack of social support. If the family is having difficulty obtaining sufficient formula or nutritious food, provide information about WIC, SNAP , local food shelves, and local community food programs. Sample Questions Tell me about your living situation. Do you live in an apartment or a house? Is permanent housing a worry for you? Do you have the things you need to take care of the baby, such as a crib, a car safety seat, and diapers? Does your home have enough heat, hot water, electricity, and working appliances? Do you have health insurance for yourself? How about for the baby? Within the past 12 months, were you ever worried whether your food would run out before you got money to buy more? Within the past 12 months, did the food you bought not last and you did not have money to get more? Have you ever tried to get help for these issues? What happened? What barriers did you face?

Y ou may be eligible for the WIC food and nutrition program. Several food programs, such as the Commodity Supplemental Food Program and SNAP , the program formerly known as Food Stamps, also can help you. If you are breastfeeding and eligible for WIC, you can get nutritious food for yourself and support from peer counselors. Would you like their numbers? Would you like someone from our office to help you get in touch with them? XIt's good that these things are not a concern for you right now. If things change, please consider us a place where you can get ideas about whom to contact for help. We know how important these things are to helping you keep your baby and your family healthy and safe. XOne way to deal with unwanted advice from family and friends is to acknowledge their concerns and desire to help and then change the subject to something you do agree on. Trying to justify your desire to follow the recommendations of your health care professional may only lead to a long and futile conversation. Risks: Environmental Tobacco Exposure Address how smoking affects a young baby's health and increases the baby's chance for respiratory infec\u00adtions, SIDS, ear infections, and asthma. Provide smoking cessation strategies and make specific referrals as needed. If either parent quit smoking during the pregnancy, congratulate the parent and encourage him or her to continue remaining abstinent from tobacco. Sample Questions Did you smoke or use e-cigarettes before or during this pregnancy? Does anyone else in your home smoke? Do you or anyone you live with use e-cigarettes? Have you been able to cut down the daily number of cigarettes? Do you know where to get help with stopping smoking? Anticipatory Guidance XIt's important to keep your car, home, and other places where your baby spends time free of tobacco smoke and vapor from e\u00adcigarettes. Smoking affects the baby by increasing the risk of asthma, ear infections, respiratory infections, and sudden infant death. X800-QUIT-NOW (800-784-8669); TTY 800-332-8615 is a national telephone triage and support service that is routed to local resources. Additional resources are available at www.cdc.gov. Specific informa\u00ad tion for women is available at http://women.smokefree.gov. Strengths and Protective Factors: Family Support Parents look to many people and information sources for answers to their questions about their chil\u00ad dren's health and development. They need a support network, whether with friends or family members or through community programs. Social media can allow parents to share parenting tips and resources, and create a virtual support network. Ask the parents what sites (including blogs and birth groups) they are using for networking and finding information regarding parenting and their new baby. Explore how they sort through all the varied online BFG 4TH ED.indb 368 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents369 INFANCY FIRST WEEK VISIT (3 TO 5 DAYS)information and decide what they believe is valuable. Be ready to provide parents with trusted sources of maternal and child health information, and provide these links on your own Web site. The AAP's HealthyChildren.org is one resource that health care professionals can provide to parents (Web site: www.HealthyChildren.org, Twitter: @healthychildren). Parents of hospitalized babies or whose babies have special health care needs may be more likely to seek out virtual networks for support and informa\u00ad tion. Trusted Web sites with accurate information can be recommended. Sample Questions Where do you go for answers about health questions? How do you decide if the information you are given is something you are going to try or believe? Anticipatory Guidance XSocial media tools can be useful in building social networks, but do not rely on them for maternal and child health advice. I can answer your questions and give you useful and reliable information. XIt is important that parents have people they can turn to when they need help with the baby. Talking with family members or friends and making arrangements with them so that they can be prepared to help if needed is one way to address this issue. These people usually are willing to help, but may need specific information about ways in which they can be most helpful. BFG 4TH ED.indb 369 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents370 INFANCY FIRST WEEK VISIT (3 TO 5 DAYS)Transition Home The first weeks with a new baby are a stressful time of transitions in which parents and other family mem\u00ad bers must learn how to care for the baby and adjust to new roles. New mothers also must focus on their physical recovery from the birth. Counsel the new parents on this transitional time and provide strategies for settling into a routine. Review expectations, perspectives, and satisfaction with parenthood, as well as how well any siblings and the extended family are functioning. Sample Questions How is the adjustment to the new baby going? How are your partner or other family members helping with the baby? Anticipatory Guidance XThe first week home is a time of transitions. It is normal for you to feel uncertain, overwhelmed, and very tired at times. As you and your baby get to know each other, it gets much better! XMaking sure to rest and sleep when the baby sleeps is one way to help you maintain your sense of well\u00adbeing. Another is to let your partner and other family members do things for you and participate in the care of the baby by holding, bathing, changing, dressing, and calming him. Sibling Adjustment Parent concerns about sibling reactions to meeting the baby are best guided according to the siblings' developmental ages and responses. Behavior regression and jealousy sometimes occur with an older sib\u00ad ling. Inquire about other children, older family members and others living in the home, family routines, and relationships. Anticipatory guidance regarding the newborn's health and safety will vary, based on the specific cultural traditions of the family. Sample Questions Are there other children in your home? How old are they? How did they respond to your pregnancy and the thought of becoming a big brother/sister? How are your other children coping with the new baby? Is that difficult for you? Do you have any children or family members living with you who have special health or developmental care needs?

Television (TV) and other media distract a parent's attentiveness and reduce the language to which the baby is exposed. As more families and children have access to and exposure to digital media, it is important to assess for the use of such devices and offer guid\u00ad ance about consequences of media use for a child this age. Sample Questions Do you have books to read with your baby? Have you found good times to talk and read together? Is there a TV or other digital media device on in the background while your baby is in the room? Anticipatory Guidance XWhenever you can, sing and talk to your baby. Begin to communicate interactively and see how your baby responds more and more each week. XSet a time each day to sit together and read. Y our baby won't understand the story, but she will love hearing the sound of your voice, and the physical closeness of sitting together will enhance your bond\u00ad ing. Be sure to turn off TVs, radios, smartphones, and other digital media. Babies cannot learn language f r o m T V. XHaving a TV on in the background can distract you from reading your baby's cues. Reading her cues is important to learning about her patterns of behavior and developing sensitive interactions with her. These interactions between you and your baby are crucial for language, cognitive, and emotional development. Adjustment to Home Healthy newborns breastfeed at least 8 to 12 times in 24 hours and often much more frequently. Breastfeedings may occur in clusters and without obvious patterns. Newborns tend to waken about equally, day and night. Newborns with rapid state changes from sleep or drowsiness to crying, or newborns whose parents are concerned with excessive crying, may need additional counseling.

About how often does your baby feed each day? Where does she sleep? Is she able to come to an alert state for feeding? What have you found works to wake up your baby for feedings or to calm her for sleep? Anticipatory Guidance XAt this age, newborns usually lack a day and night schedule. They may or may not sleep for a longer stretch during the day. XThe room temperature should be comfortable and the baby should be kept from getting too warm or too cold while sleeping. XNewborn sleeping patterns may be different from one baby to another. Usually, in the first few weeks, the baby's pattern may vary from day to day, but most babies will sleep 16 to 20 hours out of 24. They need to be fed on cue about every 1 to 2 hours, and have one period where they may sleep for up to 3 hours. XA newborn is often tired after delivery, just like her parents. Medications you received can prolong this sleepy period. For your baby to feed consistently through the day and night, she may need help waking up for feedings. Use a variety of stimulating actions, such as rocking, patting, stroking, diaper changes, and undressing, to help her come to an alert state for feeding. XOther types of actions, such as stroking your baby's head or gentle repetitive rocking, help put your baby to sleep and are useful for con soling her. Calming The newborn period is a time of great adjustment and change for parents. Encourage parents to learn about their baby's temperament and how it affects the way she relates to the world. Some spirited babies will need help from their parents to learn to calm down. Acknowledge the parents' abilities as they respond to and care for their newborn to reinforce their sense of competence. By effectively managing stress, par \u00ad ents feel better and can provide more nurturing attention, which provides a protective environment for their newborn. Parents can learn effective ways to calm their baby and reach out to friends and family for support, when needed. Evidence of ambivalence or stress caused by the home situation or the care of the newborn may require referrals to community support systems, such as public health nursing, home care, or other community agencies. Sample Questions How do you feel when you have the baby with you? Have you been able to rest or get sleep? What is it like for you when your baby cries? What do you do for her when she cries? Anticipatory Guidance XEven though taking care of a newborn can be tiring, it can also be great fun as you watch the baby adjust to her new surroundings and begin to recognize you. XY our baby has to adjust to the world around her while learning to let you know what she needs through her cries and movements. Newborns also have to learn how to respond to all the new sights, sounds, and physical contacts, like touch, that they are exposed to after birth. Some babies will have an easy time of this; others will need your help to learn to calm down or soothe themselves.

When babies cry, it's because they need us. She may miss the warmth and gentle swaying of your body and the sounds of your heartbeat and voice that she felt and heard while she was still inside you. She may be hungry or wet, or too cold or too warm. She is adjusting to her new environment and needs your help to become comfortable. XIt is normal for parents to feel upset or frustrated sometimes when there's a new baby at home. All parents get upset sometimes. XNever shake your baby to try to get her to calm down or stop crying. If you feel you may lose con\u00ad trol, put the baby in a safe place, like a crib or a cradle. Y our crying baby will be OK while you regain your calm. When to Call (Temperature Taking) and Emergency Readiness (CPR) It may take some time for parents of newborns to develop confidence in their ability to care for their baby. They may welcome guidance about issues such as knowing when to call the practice, knowing how to determine and prevent illness in their baby, and knowing how to handle emergencies. Sample Questions What type of thermometer do you have? Do you know how to use it? Do you know what to do in an emergency or if you have concerns or questions about your baby? Do you know how to call our office so we can work with you to ensure your baby's health and well-being? Do you know how we handle your after office-hours care? Anticipatory Guidance XIn the first year of life, taking your baby's temperature rectally is the only accurate method. A rectal temperature of 100.4F/38.0C or higher is considered a fever. Home ear or skin temperatures are not accurate enough. XY ou can call our office any time with questions. XHere are some emergency preparedness strategies. -Complete an American Heart Association or American Red Cross first aid or infant CPR program. -Have a family first aid kit. -Make a list of the local emergency telephone numbers, including our office and after \u00adhours number and the national Poison Help line ( 800-222-1222). Post these numbers at every telephone and store them in your cell phone. XHave a family emergency preparedness plan and become familiar with your community's emer \u00ad gency plan. Illness Prevention (Handwashing, Outings) and Sun Exposure In spite of protective maternal antibodies, infants are at risk for communicable illness. Sun exposure risk in babies is best prevented by avoiding the sun. Sample Questions What questions do you have about going out with your baby? Going to public places, such as parks or faith- based activities? What to tell visitors about handling your baby? BFG 4TH ED.indb 374 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents375 INFANCY FIRST WEEK VISIT (3 TO 5 DAYS)Anticipatory Guidance XTo protect your baby in the first month of life, do not let her be handled by many people. Avoid crowded places, overdressing, and exposure to very hot or cold temperatures. XMake sure to wash your hands often, especially after diaper changes and before feeding the baby. XMake sure that you and all adults who will have contact with your baby have had pertussis and influenza immunizations. XAs much as possible, keep your baby out of the sun. If she has to be in the sun, use a sunscreen made for children. For babies younger than 6 months, sunscreen may be used on small areas of the body, such as the face and backs of the hands, if adequate clothing and shade are not available. General Guidance on Feeding (Weight Gain, Feeding Strategies, Holding, Burping, Hunger and Satiation Cues) One of the first tasks for parents during their newborn's first week is learning when and how much their baby needs either for breastfeeding or formula. The First Week Visit usually provides parents with reassur \u00ad ance that their baby has started to gain weight after the initial weight loss and is thus getting the appropri\u00adate feedings. Close supervision and counseling are needed to assist parents in ensuring that their newborn awakens for feedings to ensure adequate hydration. Providing parents with guidance to recognize their baby's signals for both hunger and satiety will help them provide an appropriate feeding amount and frequency, as well as avoid overfeeding. Counseling may be needed to discuss the best ways of holding the baby during feedings. It also may be advisable to actually observe the newborn feeding. For example, some newborns with reflux will arch their back and pull away from the parent, leaving the parent with the impression that the newborn does not like the human milk, formula, or being held. This is an important cue that the family needs additional counsel\u00ad ing and assistance. If the family is having difficulty obtaining sufficient formula or nutritious food, provide information about WIC, SNAP , local food shelves, and local community food programs.

Anticipatory Guidance XIf you are bottle\u00adfeeding, do not prop the bottle, as this puts your baby at risk of choking, ear infections, and early childhood caries or tooth decay. Holding your baby close while you feed him gives you the opportunity for warm and loving interaction with him. XBabies usually burp at natural breaks (eg, midway through or after a feeding). Help him burp by gently rubbing or patting his back while holding him against your shoulder and chest or supporting him in a sitting position on your lap. XY our baby is getting enough milk if he has 6 to 8 wet cloth diapers (5 or 6 disposable diapers) and 3 or 4 stools per day and is gaining weight appropriately. XBreastfed newborns usually have loose, frequent stools. After several weeks, the number of bowel movements may decrease. Breastfed babies who are 4 weeks and older may have stools as infrequently as every 3 days or more. XHealthy babies do not require extra water, as breast milk and formula, when properly prepared, are adequate to meet the newborn's fluid needs. XA baby's usual signs of hunger include putting his hand to his mouth, sucking, rooting, facial grimaces, and fussing. Crying is a late sign of hunger. XY ou can tell he's full because he will gently release the nipple, close his mouth, or relax his arms and hands. Breastfeeding Guidance Mothers Mothers who breastfeed should ingest 500 \u00b5g of folate or folic acid daily by taking a daily prenatal vitamin or a multivitamin in addition to eating a nutritious diet. The mother's diet should include an average daily intake of 200 mg to 300 mg of the omega\u00ad3 long\u00adchain PUFA DHA to guarantee a sufficient concentration of preformed DHA in the milk. This is obtained either through supplementation or consumption of 1 to 2 portions (3 oz each) of fish (eg, herring, canned light tuna, salmon) per week. The concern regarding the possible risk from intake of excessive mercury or other contaminants is offset by the neurobehavioral benefits of an adequate DHA intake and can be minimized by avoiding the intake of 4 types of fish that are high in mercury. These are tilefish, shark, swordfish, and king mackerel. Additionally, the mother's diet should include 550 mg/day of choline because human milk is rich in choline and depletes the moth\u00ad er's tissue stores. In the diets of women, eggs, milk, chicken, beef, and pork are the biggest contributors of choline. For vegan mothers, who consume no animal products in their diet, a daily multivitamin including iron, zinc, vitamin B 12, omega\u00ad3 fatty acids, and 550 mg of choline is recommended.

Sample Questions How is breastfeeding going for you and your baby? How often does your baby breastfeed? How long do feedings last? Does it seem like your baby is breastfeeding more often or for longer periods of time, compared with the first couple of days? How can you tell whether your baby is satisfied at the breast? What concerns do you have about breastfeeding? Is breastfeeding uncomfortable or do you have sore nipples? Are you continuing to take prenatal vitamins? What over-the-counter or prescription medications are you taking? Are you taking any vitamin-mineral or herbal supplements? What questions do you have about any condition that might prevent you from breastfeeding? Are you offering the baby breast milk in a bottle? Are you using a pacifier? Will you be able to breastfeed your baby if you return to work or school? Do you eat fish at least 1 to 2 times per week? Do you have protein-containing foods every day, such as eggs, chicken, beef or pork, or dairy? Anticipatory Guidance XExclusive breastfeeding continues to be the ideal source of nutrition for about the first 6 months of life. XAt about 1 week of age, your baby should feed every 1 to 3 hours in the daytime, and every 3 hours at night, with one longer 4\u00ad to 5\u00adhour stretch between feedings. For the first few weeks, your baby should breastfeed between 8 to 12 times in 24 hours. XY ou can help your baby by paying attention to his sleep cycles in the day. When he comes to a drowsy state, change his diaper and wake him for a feeding about every 2 to 3 hours. XBreastfeeding may be challenging for mothers, whether or not they have breastfed before. Every baby is different and catches on a little differently. That is why lactation consultants and breastfeeding support groups are valuable for consultation, education, and support as you and your baby are beginning to breastfeed. I can give you contact information for community groups and a lactation consultant. XIf you are breastfeeding your baby, be sure that you are giving him vitamin D drops. XY ou may continue to take your prenatal vitamin with iron every day to ensure adequate intake of vita\u00admins and minerals. If you do not consume any animal products in your diet and follow a vegan diet, your supplement should include vitamins D and B 12. XEating a small serving of fish 2 times a week provides important nutrients to your baby. Canned light tuna, salmon, trout, and herring are the best choices to give your baby the neurobehavioral benefits of an adequate intake of an important fat called DHA. XIt is best to avoid 4 kinds of fish that are high in mercury. These fish are tilefish, shark, swordfish, and king mackerel. XConsuming small amounts of protein\u00ad containing foods, such as lean meat, poultry, dairy products, beans and peas, eggs, processed soy products, and nuts and seeds, every day is recommended. XBecause newborns feed so frequently, you should avoid alcohol in the first several months of your baby's life. Alcohol easily passes into breast milk and can remain in breast milk for 2 to 3 hours. BFG 4TH ED.indb 377 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents378 INFANCY FIRST WEEK VISIT (3 TO 5 DAYS)Formula-Feeding Guidance A newborn who is growing appropriately will average 20 oz of formula per day, with a range of 16 to 24 oz per day. Formula preparation and formula safety information is needed for parents, especially the length of time over which formula from one feeding can be offered to the newborn. Parents also need to know why it is important to seek professional guidance before changing to a different formula. Sample Questions Do you have any concerns about formula? What concerns do you have about cost, nutrient content, and differences across brands? Are you able to get your baby's formula from WIC? What questions do you have about preparing formula and storing it safely? Anticipatory Guidance XMake sure to always use iron\u00adfortified formula. At first, give your baby 2 oz of prepared formula every 2 to 3 hours. Give him more if he still seems hungry. As he grows and his appetite increases, you will need to prepare larger amounts. XBecause formula is expensive, you may be hesitant to throw away any that is left in the bottle. For food safety reasons, if your baby has not taken all of the formula at one feeding, you may use it for the next feeding, but be sure to put it back in the refrigerator. Do not mix this formula with new formula. If the formula has been heated and has been out of the refrigerator for 1 hour or more, discard it. XNever heat a bottle in a microwave. If you wish to warm a bottle, a hot water bath is recommended. XIf you are thinking about switching brands of formula, talk to me first. Car Safety Seats Parents should not place their baby's car safety seat in the front seat of a vehicle with a passenger air bag because the air bags deploy with great force against a car safety seat and cause serious injury or death. Counsel parents that their own safe driving behaviors (including using seat belts at all times and not driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs) are important to the health of their children. Babies with special health care needs require special consideration for safe transportation. Refer parents to a local, specially trained Child Passenger Safety Technician for assistance with special positioning and restraint devices (http://cert.safekids.org).

Do you have any problems using your baby's car safety seat? Anticipatory Guidance XA rear \u00adfacing car safety seat should always be used to transport your baby in all vehicles, including taxis and cars owned by friends or other family members. XThe back seat is the safest place for children to ride. The harnesses should be snug and the car safety seat should be positioned at the recommended angle so that the baby's head does not fall forward. (Check the instructions to find the right angle and how to adjust it.) Babies with special needs, such as prema\u00ad ture babies or babies in casts, need special consideration for safe transportation. XY our baby needs to stay in her car safety seat at all times during travel. If she becomes fussy or needs to breastfeed, stop the vehicle and take her out of the car safety seat to attend to her needs. Strap her safely back into her seat before traveling again. XCar safety seats should be used only for travel, not for positioning outside the vehicle. Keep the har \u00ad nesses snug whenever your baby is in the car safety seat. This will help prevent falls out of the seat and strangulation on the harnesses. XY our own safe driving habits are important to the health of your children. Always use a seat belt and do not drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Never text or use a cell phone or other handheld device while driving.

Click on \"Find a Tech. \"Toll-free Auto Safety Hotline: 888-327-4236 Heatstroke Prevention Each year, an average of 37 children die of heatstroke after being left in a car that can become too hot. More than half of the deaths are infants and children younger than 2 years. In most cases, the parent or caregiver forgot the child was in the car, often because there was a change in the usual routine or schedule. Even very loving and attentive parents can forget a child in the car. Additionally, some children have died while playing in the vehicle or after getting in the vehicle without the care giver's knowledge. The temperature inside a car can rise to a dangerous level quickly, even when the temperature outside is as low as 60 degrees. Leaving the windows open will not prevent heatstroke. Because children have propor \u00ad tionally less surface area than adults and less ability to regulate internal temperature, their bodies overheat up to 5 times more quickly than adults' bodies. Sample Question Every year, children die of heatstroke after being left in a hot car. Would you like to talk about creating a plan so this doesn't happen to you? BFG 4TH ED.indb 379 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents380 INFANCY FIRST WEEK VISIT (3 TO 5 DAYS)Anticipatory Guidance XNever leave your child alone in a car for any reason, even briefly. XStart developing habits that will help prevent you from ever forgetting your baby in the car. Consider putting an item that you need, like your purse, cell phone, or employee ID, in the back seat of the vehicle, so you will see your baby when you retrieve the item before leaving the car. XCheck the back seat before walking away, every time you park your vehicle. Safe Sleep A family's beliefs and cultural traditions will have a significant effect on where and how the baby sleeps, and whether the family or other caregivers follow the safe to sleep message. Counsel parents about appro\u00ad priate sleep positioning and sleep location for the baby. In many cultures, family sleep arrangements are viewed as a part of the parent's commitment to their children's well\u00adbeing. Culturally sensitive information should be provided about what is known about safe\u00adsleep environments for babies. A supine position (\"back to sleep\") is best for babies, including premature babies, because of the reduction of SIDS. However, parents should avoid using wedges or other positioning devices, as they are a suffocation hazard. Room sharing is recommended for at least the first 6 months of life, with the baby in a separate, but nearby, sleep space. Bed sharing (sleeping in the same bed as the parents, another adult, or a child), and sleeping on couches or recliners, increases the risk of SUID by entrapment or parental over \u00ad lie and suffocation. Swaddling is not for sleep . It is important to explore the parents' intended infant sleep practices at home and to offer guidance to ensure the safest sleep environment for the newborn. Common beliefs and concerns expressed by families as justification for not placing their babies to sleep in the supine position include the fear of choking or aspiration, perceived uncomfortable or less peace\u00ad ful sleep, concern about a flat occiput and hair loss, and family beliefs about appropriate sleep patterns, position, and sleep location. Sleeping in a semi\u00adreclined position, such as in a swing or car seat, increases the risk of decreasing oxygen levels when an infant assumes an improper head and neck position. A semi\u00adreclined position may also worsen gastroesophageal reflux. Different cultures may view infant sleep differently than current safe sleep recommendations. These viewpoints should be sought and discussed with the parents. Parents need strategies that will assist them in engaging relatives, friends, and child care providers to fol\u00ad low safe sleep practices for the newborn. A consistent message about back to sleep provides family mem\u00ad bers with the best information when they ask about side sleeping. Sample Questions What have you heard about how babies should sleep? Where will your baby sleep? How about at naptime? Anticipatory Guidance XIt is best to always have your baby sleep on her back because it reduces the risk of sudden death. We recommend this sleep position for babies even if they are born premature or have problems with reflux, which is frequent vomiting after feeding. Do not use a wedge or other product to keep your baby on her back, as the baby can wiggle down and suffocate against the wedge. BFG 4TH ED.indb 380 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents381 INFANCY FIRST WEEK VISIT (3 TO 5 DAYS)XY our baby should sleep in your room in her own crib, but not in your bed. Think about some strategies you might use to soothe your baby without bringing her into your bed, where the risks of suffocation, entrapment, and death are increased. XIf possible, use a crib purchased after June 28, 2011, as cribs sold in the United States after that date are required to meet a new, stronger safety standard. If you use an older crib, choose one with slats that are no more than 23 8 inches (60 mm) apart and with a mattress that fits snugly, with no gaps between the mattress and the crib slats. Drop\u00adside cribs are no longer recommended. XIf you choose a mesh play yard or portable crib, consider choosing one that was manufactured after a new, stronger safety standard was implemented on February 28, 2013. If you use an older product, the weave should have openings less than \u00bc inch (6 mm) and the sides should always stay fully raised. The baby's sleep space should be kept empty, with no toys or soft bedding, such as pillows, bumpers, or blankets. XThe safest cover for the baby is a sleepsack or footed pajamas that can keep the baby warm without con\u00ad cern about suffocating under a blanket. This also allows the baby to move her legs as opposed to swad\u00ad dling, which has the potential to cause poor development of her hips and increases your baby's risk of suffocation and death. XSome babies with very sensitive startle reflexes appear more comfortable having their arms close to their body. Swaddling can help with this sensitivity. If you swaddle your baby, be sure to keep it loose around her legs, but snug\u2014not tight\u2014around her chest. To make sure your baby can breathe, leave enough space so that you can fit your hand between the blanket and her chest. Also, be sure that there are no loose ends of blanket around her neck, as these can increase her risk of suffocating. XSwaddling should only be used with babies younger than 2 months and is recommended only when your baby is awake. Older babies can roll over and risk suffocation if they are swaddled. XY our baby should sleep in a crib or bassinet, not in a swing, bouncer, or car safety seat. Sleeping in a semi\u00adreclined position can contribute to decreased oxygen levels in a newborn. If your baby falls asleep in one of these places, move him to a crib or bassinet as soon as possible. Safe Home Environment: Burns Sample Question Have you made any changes in your home to keep your baby safe? Anticipatory Guidance XDo not drink hot liquids while holding the baby. XTo protect your child from tap water scalds, the hottest temperature at the faucet should be no higher than 120\u00b0 F. In many cases, you can adjust your water heater. Before bathing the baby, always test the water temperature with your wrist to make sure it is not too hot. BFG 4TH ED.indb INFANCY WEEK VISIT (3 TO 5 DAYS)INFANCY 1 MONTH VISITWithin the first month, parents become increas\u00ad ingly attuned to their baby as they learn to inter \u00ad pret the meanings of their baby's cues and how their caregiving responses to the baby's behaviors may influence her behaviors. Through their grow\u00ad ing understanding of their newborn, parents learn strategies to support the baby's emerging person\u00adality and self\u00adregulation. The primary focus of parents' caregiving relates to feedings, sleep and wake patterns, elimination, and assimilation into the family. The frequency of visits during the first 2 months of life will depend on the baby's health status and the family's needs. Babies who were premature or sick at birth, those entering foster care or adoptive families, those with special health or develop\u00ad mental needs, and first\u00adtime or anxious parents likely will need more frequent visits. In addition to offering counseling and reassurance to the parents, the health care professional may need to arrange referrals for comprehensive evaluation and management of the infant's problems and for community\u00adbased family support services. As coordinator of the infant's medical home, the health care professional will ascertain and assist the family in ensuring that appropriate linkages are in place for any needed subspecialty medical or surgical care and early intervention services.The 1 Month Visit encompasses routine health surveillance, response to parental concerns, and encouragement, support, and practical guidance about the infant's growth and nutrition, develop\u00ad ment, and normal sleep patterns. For the infant born preterm or with a health condition that makes feeding a challenge, additional attention will need to be directed toward feeding skills, the adequacy of nutrient and caloric intake, and infant growth. The results of newborn screening, including blood, hearing, and critical congenital heart disease, and hearing screening tests should be reviewed, and repeat testing, as required, should be arranged or completed. Risk factors requir \u00ad ing future testing should be documented. If the parents will be returning to work or school in the near future, guidance regarding the selection of safe child care may be provided. The mother's plans regarding infant feeding also should be explored. Discussion points may include human milk pumping and storage and the introduction of bottle\u00adfeeding (expressed human milk or infant formula) in the exclusively breastfeeding infant. Families experiencing adjustment difficulties, and mothers manifesting postpartum psychological symptoms, will require close involvement and interaction with the health care professional and may need referral to resources to support their material or emotional needs.

Use of the questions may vary from visit to visit and from family to family. Questions can be modified to match the health care professional's commu\u00ad nication style. The accompanying anticipatory guidance for the family should be geared to questions, issues, or concerns for that particular infant and family. Tools and handouts to support anticipatory guid\u00adance can be found in the Bright Futures Tool and Resource Kit. Risks: Living Situation and Food Security Probe for stressors, such as return to work or school or the inability to return to work or school, competing family needs, or loss of social or financial support. Suggest community resources that help with finding quality child care, accessing transportation, getting a car safety seat and crib, or addressing issues such as financial concerns, inadequate resources to cover health care expenses, inadequate or unsafe housing, parental inexperience, or lack of social support. If the family is having difficulty obtaining sufficient for \u00ad mula or nutritious food, provide information about WIC, SNAP , local food shelves, and local community food programs. For mothers or caregivers who have a limited support network, community services and resources may be able to help the family. Support family connection to the community through social, faith\u00adbased, cultural, volunteer, and recre\u00ad ational organizations or programs.

Encourage parents who are quitting, and provide information about smoking cessation strategies and resources for those who are considering quitting. Sample Question Does anyone who lives in or visits the home smoke or use e-cigarettes? Anticipatory Guidance XIt is important to keep your car, home, and other places the baby stays free of tobacco smoke and vapor from e\u00adcigarettes. Exposure to tobacco smoke can increase your baby's risk of sudden infant death, as well as asthma, ear infections, and respiratory infections.

Sample Questions Are you aware of any health concerns in your family related to your home caused by dampness or mold? Do you have water leaks in your home? Have you had problems with mold or dampness? Anticipatory Guidance XSome homes may have health risks that may affect your baby. Exposure to damp and moldy envi\u00adronments can cause a variety of health effects in people sensitive to mold. Mold exposure can cause nasal stuffiness, throat irritation, coughing or wheezing, eye irritation, or, in more severe cases, breath\u00ad ing difficulties. XMold will grow in places with a lot of moisture, such as around leaks in roofs, windows, or pipes, or where there has been flooding. Mold grows easily on paper products, cardboard, ceiling tiles, and wood products.

Risks: Radon Radon is a gas that is a product of the breakdown of uranium in soil and rock. It also may be in water, natural gas, and building materials. High levels of radon enter homes in many regions of the United States through cracks or openings in the walls, foundation, and floors, or occasionally in well water. It does not cause health problems immediately upon inhalation. Over time, however, it can increase the risk of lung cancer. In fact, next to cigarette smoking, radon is thought to be the most common cause of lung cancer in the United States. Sample Question If your home has a basement, has it been checked for radon?

XIf your radon level is high, consider taking action to reduce it to an acceptable level. Call 800-SOS-RADON. Risks: Pesticides Pesticides are often used in a variety of products for the control of pests both in the indoor and outdoor environments. They may affect children's health in a variety of ways. Thousands of cases of pesticide poisonings are reported to poison control centers every year. Sample Question Do you use pesticides inside or outside the home? Anticipatory Guidance XAvoid using pesticides. Instead, choose the least toxic methods for pest control, commonly referred to as integrated pest management. These include repairing all cracks in your house to prevent pests from getting in and making sure that your food is securely sealed. XIf needed, use baits, traps, or gels instead of fogging, bombing, or spraying. Store and dispose of these items safely.

When inquiring, avoid asking about abuse or domestic violence. Instead, use descriptive terms, such as hit, kicked, shoved, choked, and threatened. Provide information about the effect of family violence on children and about community resources that provide assistance. Recommend resources for parent education and parent support groups. To avoid causing upset to families by questioning about sensitive and private topics such as family vio\u00ad lence, alcohol and drug use, and similar risks, it is recommended to begin screening about these topics with an introductory statement, such as, \"I ask all patients standard health questions to understand factors that may affect health of their child as well as their own health. \" Sample Questions Because violence is so common in so many people's lives, I've begun to ask about it. I don't know if this is a problem for you, but many children I see have parents who have been hurt by someone else. Some are too afraid or uncomfortable to bring it up, so I've started asking all my patients about it routinely. Do you always feel safe in your home? Has your partner, or another significant person in your life, ever hit, kicked, or shoved you, or physically hurt you or the baby? Are you scared that you or other caregivers may hurt the baby? Do you have any questions about your safety at home? What will you do if you feel afraid? Do you have a plan? Would you like information on where to go or who to contact if you ever need help? Anticipatory Guidance XOne way that I and other health care professionals can help you if your partner, or another significant person in your life, is hitting or threatening you is to support you and provide information about local resources that can help you. XY ou can also call the toll\u00adfree National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-SAFE (7233). Risks: Maternal Alcohol and Substance Use Any substance taken during pregnancy should be evaluated for its overall risk to the newborn, including prescription drugs, over \u00adthe\u00adcounter preparations, pain relievers, herbal substances, and illegal substances. Alcohol use during pregnancy is a particular risk for an infant. If the mother acknowledges alcohol use during pregnancy and this was not previously discussed as part of the prenatal history, discuss the con\u00ad cerns to the developing fetus about both ND\u00adPAE and other FASD. Both ND\u00adPAE and FASD have lifelong effects on the infant that can include physical problems and problems with behavior and learning. Fetal alcohol exposure, including the timing during the pregnancy, quantity, and duration, is important to docu\u00ad ment for later diagnosis of FASD. Referrals to community social service agencies and drug treatment programs can be provided if the mother is not already linked to these services. New borns determined to be at risk can be referred to support programs, such as a local Early Interven tion Program agency, often referred to as IDEA Part C.

For any response other than \"Never, \" continue by asking the following questions: In the 3 months before you knew you were pregnant, how many times did you have 4 or more drinks in a day? After you knew you were pregnant, how many times did you have 4 or more drinks in a day? Depending on the responses to any of the above questions, the health care professional can, if desired, follow up to determine frequency and extent of consumption by asking the following questions: During the pregnancy, on average, how many days per week did you have a drink? During the pregnancy on a typical day when you had an alcoholic beverage, how many drinks did you have? Do you, or does anyone you ride with, ever drive after having a drink? Does your partner use alcohol? What kind and for how long? If any maternal at-risk drinking is identified, a brief intervention and referral is recommended. Are you using marijuana, cocaine, pain pills, narco tics, or other controlled substances? What have you heard about the drug's effects on the baby during pregnancy or after the baby is born? Are you getting any help to cut down or stop your drug use? Are you taking any medicines or vitamins at the present time? Are you using any prescription or over-the- counter medications or pain relievers? Have you used any health remedies or special herbs or teas to improve your health since you have been pregnant? Is there anything that you used to take, but stopped using when you learned that you were pregnant? Anticipatory Guidance XBecause alcohol is passed into the breast milk, it is important for mothers to avoid alcohol for 2 to 3 hours before breastfeeding or during breastfeeding. This also means that, because newborns breast\u00ad feed so frequently (every 2-3 hours), you most likely will have to avoid alcohol during the first several months of your baby's life. XMost medications are compatible with breastfeeding, but should be checked on an individual basis. To understand how they may affect your baby, it is important to know what over \u00adthe\u00adcounter medications or herbal products you are taking. XThe reason we are concerned about a parent's use of alcohol or drugs is because of the effects on the baby's mental, physical, and social development. Alcohol misuse can harm a parent's interaction with the baby and lead to poor decisions about the baby's care. XDrug and alcohol cessation programs are available in our community and we would like to help you connect to these services so that you can safely care for your baby and yourself.

Parents need strategies to help juggle multiple responsibilities and garner support from each other and other family members. Help parents understand the importance of asking for help when they need it. Recognize that fathers also will need support, as they may feel conflicted about their desire to be with and support the mother and baby, while needing to return to work. In many cultures, the grandmother or other female relative provides for, or supervises the care of, the young infant. However, many of today's families, including immigrant families, may not have this resource available to them. Parents need to be aware of the many different kinds of child care arrange\u00ad ments that are available in the community. Parents who are planning on returning to work have many feelings about leaving their baby and need assistance in finding high\u00adquality child care and, for the mother, in determining how to continue breast\u00ad feeding. It is important at this time to assess for connections to community and parents' ability to get information about child care options that match their needs. Sample Questions How do you feel about returning to work or school? Do you wonder about how returning to work or school may affect your relationship with your baby? For mothers: How it may affect breastfeeding? Have you spoken with your employer about continuing to breastfeed when you return to work? Who will take care of the baby while you are at work/school? Have you made arrangements for child care? What factors did you or are you taking into account when deciding on a child care provider for your baby\u2014 factors such as affordability, quality, comfort, and access? Would you like any information about things to consider when selecting an affordable, safe child care provider? Anticipatory Guidance XReturning to work is often a hard thing to do, but many people are willing to help new parents find a situation they feel comfortable with. Finding a good child care arrangement that you trust will help you feel better about this decision. There are helpful resources and written guides as well as community resources available to assist you in selecting the right child care for you and your child. XI also can give you advice and information about resources that can help you identify child care and help you continue breastfeeding after you go back to work/school.

Any suggestion of depression should trigger screening questions for increased drug and alcohol use. Explore issues of substance abuse (with legal and illegal drugs) as self\u00admedication of mood. As needed, refer the mother to her obstetrician or other health care professional and appropriate community\u00adbased mental health services. Ask the mother what other medical visits that she has had in the interim for herself or the infant and whether she has health insurance. Sample Questions What have you heard from your obstetrician or other health care professional about resuming your normal daily activities after delivery? When is your postpartum checkup? How are you managing any pain or discomfort from delivery? How is breastfeeding going? Anticipatory Guidance XTypically, a 6\u00adweek postpartum checkup should be scheduled to discuss how you are feeling and make any arrangement you wish about birth control. Sometimes, moms are so tired or busy they forget or just don't make their postpartum appointment. XIf you are still feeling discomfort from the delivery, you should talk with your obstetrician or health care professional. Maternal Depression An estimated 10% to 20% of women struggle with major depression before, during, and after delivery of a baby. Perinatal depression has substantial personal consequences and interferes with quality of child\u00ad rearing, adversely affecting parent and infant interactions, maternal responsiveness to infant vocalizations and gestures, and other stimulation essential for optimal child development. Because pregnancy and childbirth are supposed to be a joyous occasion, women may feel that they are going to be bad mothers if they are depressed. It is important for apprehensive patients to understand what postpartum depression is, to know that many women experience similar feelings, and to realize that untreated postpartum depression may have adverse effects on women's health and their children's health and development.

How are you feeling emotionally? Have you been feeling sad, blue, or hopeless since the delivery? Are you still interested in activities you used to enjoy? Do you find that you are drinking, using herbs, or taking drugs to help make you feel less depressed, less anxious, less frustrated, and calmer? Who has been available to assist you at home? Who has been the most help to you? Over the past 2 weeks, have you ever felt down, depressed, or hopeless? Over the past 2 weeks, have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things? Do you have any physical symptoms, like headache, chest pain, or palpitations? Anticipatory Guidance XMany mothers feel tired or overwhelmed in the first weeks at home. These feelings should not continue, however. If you find that you are still feeling very tired or overwhelmed, or you are using over \u00adthe\u00ad counter or prescription medication, drugs, or alcohol to feel better, let your partner, your own health care professional, or me know so that you can get the help you need. XIt is common for women during and after pregnancy to feel down or depressed. It is very important to address these feelings to ensure your health and your baby's health. XEmphasizing healthy life behaviors, like getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and finding time for walking or other light physical activity, can help you feel better. XIf you are sad or down for more than 2 days, please speak with me about options for treatment. Talk therapy or counseling is generally rapidly helpful. Family Relationships Families who are living with others (eg, their elders, those who are helping them from being homeless, or teen parents living with their parents) may have little control over their environment and caregiver roles and responsibilities. For some families, gender roles may preclude women from asking men for help. In a culturally sensitive way, health care professionals need to develop strategies with parents and the family about how to support the mother's needs. If parents are feeling stressed or if they are having difficulty getting along together, they need referral to an appropriate mental health care professional. Sample Questions How are you finding taking care of yourself and the baby? Are you able to find time for your other children? Who helps you with the baby? Are your partner or other family members able to help care for the baby or with things around the house? How are your other children reacting to the baby? Have you observed any behavior changes, jealousy, or anything that concerns you? How are you handling this? Anticipatory Guidance XFinding time for yourself can be a challenge. Talking with your partner and problem\u00adsolving together will help your partner feel involved and identify ways to help you. It also may be important to have someone to talk with if you feel isolated and alone.

Parents may need reas\u00ad surance that infants' sleep patterns are highly variable, and that their need for frequent night feedings is normal. An infant's inability to sleep may result from illness or allergy, but not from a failure to learn how to sleep. Sample Questions How is your baby sleeping? Does he use a pacifier? When do you use the pacifier? Anticipatory Guidance XPutting the baby in his crib either awake or drowsy, not in a deep sleep, will help him make the tran\u00adsition from being awake to asleep in the crib. This will avoid problems with night waking later on because, when he wakes up, he will be in a familiar place. XThe room temperature should be comfortable and the baby should be kept from getting too warm or too cold while sleeping. XUsing a pacifier during sleep is strongly associated with a reduced risk of sudden infant death. After your baby is about 1 month old, consider offering a pacifier when he lies down for sleep. If your baby drops the pacifier, rinse it with water before reinserting it. It is important not to lick the pacifier to clean it, as you can transfer bacteria from your mouth to the baby's. Do not coat the pacifier with formula or a sweet solution. Fussiness and Attachment Offer strategies to support the infant's state regulation (alertness, orientation, and regulatory capacity) and behavioral maturation, including ways to engage the infant and console and calm him. This is particularly important if the infant was preterm or exhibits signs of easily being overstimulated or overwhelmed or if the baby is difficult to engage. Encourage parents to learn about their baby's temperament and how it affects the way he relates to the world. If the intensity, frequency, duration, and constancy of the infant's crying are worrisome or stressful for parents, it should be evaluated. Discuss with parents strategies to support their infant and her responses. The safest cover for the baby is a sleepsack or footed sleeper that can keep the baby warm without concern about suffocating under a blanket. This also allows the baby to move his legs, as opposed to swaddling, which has the potential to cause hip dysplasia.

The swaddle wrap should be snug, but not too tight, around the chest and loose around the baby's legs. When done correctly, swaddling can be an effective tool in helping to calm the infant. Concerns about infant attachment or parent\u00adinfant interaction should prompt the health care professional to refer the family to community parenting and support programs. If concerns about infant development are evident, consider referral to the local Early Intervention Program agency, often referred to as IDEA Part C. Counsel parents about how fragile an infant's brain is and how it is important to protect an infant from shaking and other forms of abuse. Parents can help their baby's other caregivers appreciate the infant's vulnerabilities and understand how to handle their frustrations with the infant's behavior. For babies who cannot be easily consoled, parents may need guidance on how to first check for the baby's safety, and then put the baby down in order to take a break. Parents can learn effective ways to calm their baby and reach out to friends and family for support, when needed. Parents can be encouraged to seek support from their natural support network for respite. Not all families will have this resource accessible to them. Health care professionals can give parents the telephone num\u00ad bers for community resources that can help. Sample Questions Tell me how you know what your baby wants. What is his cry like? Are the cries different at different times? What do you think they mean? How much is your baby crying? How often? What seems to help? Do you swaddle your baby? What do you do when you are feeling overwhelmed as a parent or frustrated with your baby? What are some of the ways you have found to calm your baby when he is crying? What do you do if they don't work? Who is helping you at home? What helps you keep calm and centered when you are stressed? Anticipatory Guidance XA young infant cannot be \"spoiled\" by holding, cuddling, and rocking him, or by talking and singing to him. Responding quickly to your baby's cry will not spoil him, but it will teach him that he will be cared for. XMany babies have fussy periods in the late afternoon or evening. Babies can't always calm themselves. Strategies to calm a fussy infant include feeding him again; being there with him; talking to, patting, or stroking him; bundling or containing him; holding and rocking him; and letting him suck. Sometimes it is hard to console a fussy or crying baby, no matter what you do. XIt will be a while before your baby is developmentally ready for self\u00adconsoling and will need your atten\u00adtion in the meantime. If you feel you're at the end of your rope and in danger of physically harming your crying baby, call for help right away. XAn infant's developmental progress toward self\u00adconsoling includes putting his hands to his mouth or sucking on his fingers, thumb, and pacifier. XHolding a baby in a front carrier or sling may decrease crying, but these may not be safe for infants who are premature or who have neuromuscular, respiratory, or neurologic problems.

To make sure your baby can breathe, leave enough space so that you can fit your hand between the blanket and his chest. Also, be sure that there are no loose ends of blanket around his neck, as these can increase his risk of suffocating. XSwaddling should only be used with babies younger than 2 months and is recommended only when your baby is awake. Older babies can roll over and risk suffocation if they are swaddled. XAll new parents feel overwhelmed, frustrated, exhausted, or angry occasionally. Remember that your baby is not trying to make you angry. He is just having a rough time and still needs someone to be there. Y ou could ask a family member, neighbor, or trusted friend to stay with your crying baby for a few minutes to allow you to take a break. If you are alone, you can try putting the baby in his crib, closing the door, and checking on him every few minutes. XNever, ever, shake your baby or otherwise harm your baby, because it could cause permanent injury, including brain damage. If you ever feel that you need help because your baby is crying so much, con\u00ad tact me or other community resources that can help you. Media As more families and children have access to and exposure to digital media, it is important to assess for the use of such devices and offer guidance regarding media in the home. Sample Question Is there a TV or other digital media device on in the background while your baby is in the room? Anticipatory Guidance XBabies this young should not watch TV or videos. Some parents try to calm their fussy babies by sitting them in front of a TV show or video, but this may make them fussier in the long run, and doesn't help them learn ways to soothe themselves. Try other ways to soothe your baby when he is fussy, such as taking a walk, holding him in a carrier, decreasing the amount of stimulation and noise in the home, or using infant massage. Y ou can also ask someone else to hold the baby so you can take a break. XHaving a TV on in the background can distract you from reading your baby's cues. Reading infant cues is important to learning about your baby's patterns of behavior and developing sensitive interactions with the baby. These interactions between you and your baby are crucial for language, cognitive, and emotional development.

Sample Question Tell me what happens with you and the baby when he is alert and awake. Anticipatory Guidance XPlaying is fun for you, but essential for your baby's brain development. XBabies need \"tummy time\" to develop head control and to get used to being on their stomach. This time is important because it stimulates muscle development and can help prevent the development of a flat area on the back of the head. During these times, place your baby in a position where he can see around the room and you can talk and interact with him even if you are doing other chores. Medical Home After-hours Support The health care professional should clearly explain the office practice plan for telephone triage, secure e\u00admail communication, after \u00adhours calls, and same\u00adday illness appointments. Parents are welcome to call about any change in the infant's activity, appearance, or behavior that makes them uncomfortable. Sample Questions Do you know when to call the health care professional? What type of thermometer do you have? Are you comfortable using it and knowing when to call the office if your child has a fever?

Encouraging parents to hold their baby and meet her needs will help the baby trust that she will be cared for. An infant who cries inconsolably for several hours a day and passes a lot of gas may have colic or reflux. Exploring the consistency and predictability of the baby's day, especially for feeding and sleeping, will help to identify strategies that parents can implement that can significantly resolve infant fussiness. This infor \u00ad mation also can shed light on other issues that may need medical intervention. Feeding strategies and information depends on whether the mother is breastfeeding or formula feeding her baby, or both. Solid foods, including cereals, are not indicated until about 6 months of age. If a parent gives the infant over \u00adthe\u00adcounter medications (eg, teas, digestive aids, or sleep or discomfort remedies), discuss the possible adverse effects. Discussion about use of these products should be con\u00ad ducted within the family's cultural context, recognizing that, for many families, these are important prac\u00adtices believed to protect the child's health and well\u00adbeing. Sample Questions How is feeding going? What are you feeding her at this time? How often are you feeding your baby during the day? During the night? Tell me about all foods and fluids you are offering the baby. Has anyone given her cereal or other food? As you are beginning to look for a child care provider, have you thought about talking with the child care provider about your baby's daily routines for feeding and sleep or how he or she might support you in continuing to breastfeed? How many wet diapers and stools does your baby have each day? Are you giving your baby any supplements, herbs, special tea, or vitamins? What vitamin or mineral supplements do you take or plan to take? Are you taking any herbs or drinking any special teas?

For infants who are not breastfeeding, iron\u00adfortified formula is the recommended substitute. XFeed your baby when she shows signs of hunger, usually every 1 to 3 hours in the daytime, and every 3 hours at night, with one longer 4\u00ad to 5\u00adhour stretch between feedings, for a total of 8 to 12 times in 24 hours. Babies should not be overfed. XDo not offer your baby food other than breast milk or formula until she is developmentally ready, which is at about 6 months old. XHealthy babies do not require extra water. Breast milk and formula (when properly prepared) are adequate to meet your baby's fluid needs. Juice is not recommended. XInfants often go through growth spurts between 6 and 8 weeks of age and significantly increase their milk intake during that time. XY our baby is getting enough milk if she has 6 to 8 wet cloth diapers (5 or 6 disposable diapers) and a variable number of stools per day and is gaining weight appropriately. XMost medications are compatible with breastfeeding, but check them out individually with me or your other health care professionals. XIf your baby is a full\u00adterm, formula\u00adfed infant, you do not need to give her vitamin supplements if the formula is iron fortified and your baby is consuming an adequate volume of formula for appro\u00ad priate growth. General Guidance on Feeding Sample Questions How do you know if your baby is hungry? How do you know if she has had enough to eat? For formula feeding: How do you hold your baby when you feed her? Do you ever prop the bottle to feed or put your baby to bed with the bottle? How easily does your baby burp during or after a feeding? Anticipatory Guidance XSigns of fullness are turning the head away from the nipple, closing the mouth, and showing interest in things other than eating. XExclusive breastfeeding or formula meets all the nutritional needs of your baby for about 6 months. At that time, breastfed infants will need zinc\u00ad and iron\u00adrich supplementary foods to meet their zinc and iron needs. XWait to introduce solid foods or liquids until about 6 months. Introducing solid foods earlier will not help your baby sleep through the night. XIf you are bottle\u00adfeeding your baby, always hold her in your arms in a partly upright position. This will allow you to look into her eyes during feedings and watch her cues for when she has had enough or needs to take break from feeding. Feeding is a wonderful opportunity for warm and loving interaction with your baby.

Propping and putting her to bed with a bottle increases the risk of choking and developing early tooth decay. XBurp your baby at natural breaks, such as midway through or after a feeding. Gently rub or pat her back while holding her against your shoulder and chest or supporting her in a sitting position on your lap. Breastfeeding Guidance Mothers Mothers who breastfeed should ingest 500 \u00b5g of folate or folic acid daily by taking a daily prenatal vitamin or a multivitamin in addition to eating a nutritious diet. The mother's diet should include an average daily intake of 200 to 300 mg of the omega\u00ad3 long\u00adchain PUFA DHA to guarantee a sufficient concentration of preformed DHA in the milk. This is obtained either through supplementation or consumption of 1 to 2 portions (3 oz each) of fish (eg, herring, canned light tuna, salmon) per week. The concern regarding the possible risk from intake of excessive mercury or other contaminants is offset by the neurobehavioral benefits of an adequate DHA intake and can be minimized by avoiding the intake of 4 types of fish that are high in mercury. These are tilefish, shark, swordfish, and king mackerel. Additionally, the mother's diet should include 550 mg/day of choline because human milk is rich in choline and depletes the moth\u00ad er's tissue stores. In the diets of women, eggs, milk, chicken, beef, and pork are the biggest contributors of choline. For vegan mothers, who consume no animal products in their diet, a daily multivitamin including iron, zinc, vitamin B 12, omega\u00ad3 fatty acids, and 550 mg of choline is recommended. Infants Breastfed preterm or low birth weight infants will need multivitamin drops and iron supplementation by 2 to 6 weeks of age (2 weeks in very low birth weight infants) before solid foods are introduced. Vitamin D supplementation (400 IU per day) is recommended for breastfed infants beginning at hos\u00ad pital discharge. Sample Questions How is breastfeeding going for you and your baby? Are you breastfeeding exclusively? If not, what else is the baby getting? Do you need any help with breastfeeding? In what ways is breastfeeding different now from when you were last here?

XY ou can be reassured about your baby's weight gain by reviewing the growth chart. XIf you are breastfeeding your baby, be sure that you are giving her vitamin D drops. XContinue to take a daily prenatal vitamin or a multivitamin, in addition to eating a nutritious diet. If you do not consume any animal products in your diet and follow a vegan diet, your supplement should include vitamins D and B 12 as well as iron and zinc. XAvoid using any bottles and supplements, unless medically indicated, until breastfeeding is well estab\u00ad lished. For most infants, this occurs around 4 to 6 weeks of age. XIf you wish to introduce a bottle to your breastfeeding baby, pick a time when she is not overly hungry or full. Have someone other than you offer the bottle. Allow the baby to explore the bottle's nipple and take it in her mouth. Experiment with different bottle nipples and flow rates. Once you find a nipple that works well for your baby, it is important to stay with that type so that she can get used to a consistent flow of milk. Over time, as her suck becomes stronger, she may need a nipple with a slower flow rate. Formula-Feeding Guidance Proper preparation, heating, and storage of infant formula should be reinforced. If there is evidence of inadequate formula availability to meet the infant's needs, appropriate referrals to WIC and other commu\u00ad nity resources should be provided. Infants will take an average of 24 to 27 oz of formula daily, with a range from 20 to 31 oz per day. Sample Questions How is formula feeding going for you and your baby? What formula do you use and how do you prepare it? Do you have enough formula for your baby? Is the formula iron fortified? How often does your baby feed? How much does your baby take at a feeding? Have you offered your baby anything other than formula? What concerns do you have about the formula, such as cost, preparation, and nutrient content? Anticipatory Guidance XY ou will need to prepare and offer more infant formula as your baby's appetite increases and she goes through growth spurts. XNever heat a bottle in a microwave. If you wish to warm a bottle, a hot water bath is recommended.

Counsel parents that their own safe driving behaviors (including using seat belts at all times and not driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs) are important to the health of their children. Infants with special needs require special consideration for safe transportation. Refer parents to a local, specially trained Child Passenger Safety Technician for assistance with special positioning and restraint devices ( www.preventinjury.org). Sample Question Are you having any problems using the baby's car safety seat? Anticipatory Guidance XA rear \u00adfacing car safety seat should always be used to transport your baby in all vehicles, including taxis and cars owned by friends or other family members. XThe back seat is the safest place for children to ride. Babies are best protected in the event of a crash when they are in the back seat and in a rear \u00adfacing car safety seat. XNever place your baby's car safety seat in the front seat of a vehicle with a passenger air bag because air bags deploy with great force. When it hits the car safety seat, it causes serious injury or death. XY our baby needs to remain in the car safety seat at all times during travel. If he becomes fussy or needs to breastfeed, stop the car and remove him from the car safety seat to attend to his needs. Strap him safely back into his seat before traveling again. XY our own safe driving behaviors are important to the health of your children.

Health care profes\u00ad sionals should be sensitive to parents' cultural traditions and beliefs about infant sleep and sleep location. The health care professional can provide suggestions about how to keep the infant from getting too warm or too cold while sleeping. Discuss with parents who are anticipating using child care whether it will be a family member or a child care center, and whether they have discussed safety issues, especially safe sleep and using a similar sleep/ wake routine for their baby. Sample Questions Where does your baby sleep now? What have you heard about \"back to sleep\" and tummy to play? Have you talked with your child care provider about safe sleep practices for your baby? Anticipatory Guidance XAlways put your baby down to sleep on his back, not his tummy or side. Ask your relatives and caregiv\u00aders to also put your baby back to sleep. XExperts recommend that your baby sleep in your room in his own crib and not in your bed. If you breastfeed or bottle\u00adfeed your baby in your bed, return him to his own crib or bassinet when you both are ready to go back to sleep. XDo not use loose, soft bedding, such as blankets, comforters, sheepskins, quilts, pillows, pillow\u00adlike bumper pads, or soft toys, in the baby's crib because they can suffocate the baby. XIf possible, use a crib purchased after June 28, 2011, as cribs sold in the United States after that date are required to meet a new, stronger safety standard. If you use an older crib, choose one with slats that are no more than 23 8 inches, or 60 mm, apart and with a mattress that fits snugly, with no gaps between the mattress and the crib slats. Drop\u00adside cribs are no longer recommended. XIf you choose a mesh play yard or portable crib, consider choosing one that was manufactured after a new, stronger safety standard was implemented on February 28, 2013. If you use an older product, the weave should have openings less than \u00bc inch (6 mm) and the sides should always stay fully raised. XIf you use a mesh play yard or portable crib, the weave should have small openings less than \u00bc inch (6 mm).

Sample Question What actions are you taking to keep your baby safe from falls? Anticipatory Guidance XAlways keep one hand on your baby when changing diapers or clothing on a changing table, couch, or bed, especially as he begins to roll over. Falls are the most frequent reason for emergency department visits for injury. XBracelets, toys with loops, or string cords should be kept away from your baby, and string or necklaces should never be around his neck. Dangling electrical, telephone, window blind, or drapery cords should be far from his reach. Emergency Care Parents will appreciate discussion of what sort of problems can be handled at the medical home and what will require emergency care. CPR and emergency and disaster preparedness may be discussed. Culturally based practices to prevent illness, such as tying amulets or strings, and any other related safety issues, are important to discuss. Sample Questions Do you know what to do in an emergency? Do you have a list of emergency numbers? Do you know when and where to go to an emergency department? Do you have access to a telephone for emergencies? Anticipatory Guidance XI encourage you to complete an American Heart Association or American Red Cross first aid or infant CPR program. XY ou also should learn what to do if your baby begins to choke. XMake sure you have a first aid kit, know the local emergency telephone numbers, and are aware of concerns that might require a 911 call. Post emergency phone numbers next to every phone and store them in your cell phone. XThink about the steps you can take to prepare for disasters or other unexpected events. Making a plan for how to deal with a storm or power outage is a great start. BFG 4TH ED.indb 408 1/20/17 2:47 PM409 INFANCY FIRST WEEK VISIT (3 TO 5 DAYS)INFANCY 1 MONTH VISITINFANCY 2 MONTH VISITContextInfancy 2 Month Visit By 2 months after birth, parents and their baby are communicating with each other. The parent and baby can gain each other's attention and respond to each other's cues. The baby looks into his parents' eyes, smiles, coos, and vocalizes reciprocally. He is attentive to his parents' voices, and reacts with enjoyment when his senses are stimulated with pleasant sights, sounds, and touch. The infant's responses to his parents when they cuddle him or talk and sing to him provide important feedback that helps the parents feel pleasure and compe\u00ad tence. Likewise, the parents' prompt responses to his cries and other subtler cues help teach him cause and effect and, most important, trust. Typically, parents have settled into their new roles, learning how to divide the tasks of caring for their baby, themselves, and the needs of the family. They may still feel tired and express a desire for rest. Other relatives and members of the support net\u00adwork feel a connection to the baby, and the parents are comfortable with them holding or caring for the baby. The baby can now hold his head upright for brief periods of time while he is being held. His weight, length, and head circumference should increase along his predicted growth curve. Parents appre\u00ad ciate the health care professional's review of early milestone development because it helps them understand and anticipate the resolution of new\u00ad born reflexes. The Moro reflex, reflex grasp, and tonic neck reflexes disappear before purposeful motor skills emerge. Opportunities for motor activity when the baby is awake, such as \"tummy time, \" should be encouraged because they promote head control. Frequent feedings are still normal for the breastfed baby. The formula\u00adfed baby may need to be fed less frequently. As the baby is able to consolidate longer sleep cycles, night feedings may occur less frequently. However, many babies have not yet begun to consolidate sleep, and many of those who have begun are likely to regress at times. Parents need to be counseled on delaying the introduction of solid foods until the middle of the first year of the baby's life and when the baby shows definite signs of readiness. These signs include increasing volume of human milk or formula consumed, and continuing physical development. Although it is a common belief, adding cereal to the diet will not increase the hours of sleep at night. Rather, the fre\u00adquency and duration of feedings, regular naptimes, and active playtimes are more likely to encourage a consolidation of nighttime sleep cycles and longer sleep duration. As the infant and family settle into a routine, parents begin to resume more of their previous activities, reengage with other family members and friends, and return to school or work. Siblings and other members of the family can be encouraged to participate in the baby's care, fostering their involvement and connection to the baby. Ideally, parents make plans to spend adult time together. Single parents may choose to spend time on out\u00ad side interests and relationships. It also is important that other children in the family have some time alone with their parents for activities they enjoy.

Arranging for quality, affordable child care is an important priority. The mother's health (both physical and emo\u00ad tional) will determine her emotional and phys\u00ad ical availability to care for her infant. Thus, she should consider talking with her partner and health care professional about completing her postpartum checkup and making family\u00adplanning arrangements. At this visit, it is important for the health care pro\u00ad fessional to review infant safety measures, includ\u00ad ing appropriate sleep position and sleep practices, because families and other caregivers may have modified the recommended safe\u00adsleeping mea\u00adsures because of perceived infant or caregiver needs. For example, the parents or other caregivers may feel that the infant's sleep is less comfortable or that spitting up poses a choking threat if the infant is on his back. It is important to ask the parents about their caregiving practices or pref\u00ad erences to determine whether they differ from recommended practices. In addition, consideration should be given to the family's environment and living circumstances, as some aspects of the child's caregiving may not be under the control of the par \u00ad ent or primary caregiver. Health care professionals should be sensitive to cultural practices, gender roles, parental age, functional abilities, and finan\u00ad cial independence of the parents. Priorities for the 2 Month Visit The first priority is to attend to the concerns of the parents. In addition, the Bright Futures Infancy Expert Panel has given priority to the following topics for discussion in this visit: XXSocial determinants of healtha (risks [living situation and food strengths and protective factors [family support, child care]) XXParent and family health and well-being (postpartum checkup, depression, sibling relationships) XXInfant behavior and development (parent-infant relationship, parent-infant communication, sleep - ing, media, playtime, fussiness) XXNutrition and feeding (general guidance on feeding and delaying solid foods, hunger and satiety cues, breastfeeding guidance, formula-feeding guidance) XXSafety (car safety seats, safe sleep, safe home environment: burns, drowning, and falls) a Social determinants of health is a new priority in the fourth edition of the Bright Futures Guidelines.

Use of the questions may vary from visit to visit and from family to family. Questions can be modified to match the health care professional's com\u00ad munication style. The accompanying anticipatory guidance for the family should be geared to questions, issues, or concerns for that particular infant and family. Tools and handouts to support anticipatory guid\u00adance can be found in the Bright Futures Tool and Resource Kit. Risks: Living Situation and Food Security Probe for stressors, such as return to work or school or the inability to return to work or school, competing family needs, or loss of social or financial support. Provide guidance, referrals, and help in connecting with community resources as needed. Suggest community resources that help with finding quality child care, accessing transportation or getting an infant car safety seat and crib, or addressing issues such as financial concerns, inadequate means to cover health care expenses, inadequate or unsafe housing, limited food resources, parental inexperience, or lack of social support. Sample Questions Tell me about your living situation. Do you live in an apartment or a house? Is permanent housing a worry for you? Do you have the things you need to take care of the baby, such as a crib, a car safety seat, and diapers? Does your home have enough heat, hot water, electricity, and working appliances? Do you have health insurance for yourself? How about for the baby? Within the past 12 months, were you ever worried whether your food would run out before you got money to buy more? Within the past 12 months, did the food you bought not last and you did not have money to get more? Have you ever tried to get help for these issues? What happened? What barriers did you face?

Y ou may be eligible for the WIC food and nutrition program. Several food programs, such as the Commodity Supplemental Food Program and SNAP , the program formerly known as Food Stamps, also can help you. Would you like their numbers? Would you like someone from our office to help you get in touch with them? XIt's good that these things are not a concern for you right now. If things change, please consider us a place where you can get ideas about whom to contact for help. We know how important these things are to helping you keep your baby and your family healthy and safe. XOne way to deal with unwanted advice from family and friends is to acknowledge their concerns and desire to help and then change the subject to something you do agree on. Trying to justify your desire to follow the recommendations of your health care professional may only lead to a long and futile conversation. Strengths and Protective Factors: Family Support Parents reach out to families and friends for support and information for strategies in caring for their child. Making friends with adults who have a child the same age can help parents establish a support net\u00ad work that is useful in planning same\u00adage playgroups and visiting neighborhood playgrounds. Families who are living with others (eg, their elders, those who are helping them from being homeless, or teen parents living with their parents) may have little control over their environment and caregiver roles and respon\u00ad sibilities. For some families, gender roles may preclude women from asking men for help. In a culturally sensitive way, health care professionals can develop strategies with parents and the family about how to support the mother's needs. Sample Questions What help do you have with the baby? Are you getting enough rest? Have you been out of the house without the baby? Who takes care of the baby when you go out? How does your baby handle this separation? Do you know parents of babies your baby's age? Do you feel you can reach out to them for help and advice? What are your plans for returning to school or work? Would you like any help in locating affordable, safe, quality child care? Anticipatory Guidance XIt is important to take time for yourself as well as time with your partner. Y our baby has a strong need to be with you. This need is stronger for some babies than for others. Let me know if you would like some suggestions for how to arrange time away from the baby or ideas for creative ways to spend time with your partner that do not compromise your baby's needs, such as activities when she is sleeping.

Parents may benefit from guidance in finding child care and ensuring that caregivers are pro\u00ad viding developmental stimulation as well as physical care. Reassure parents about how their baby can thrive in child care. It is important for them to find a person or place they can trust, that will keep their baby safe and consider her developmental needs, while engaging the parents in their infant's progress through sharing of daily activities. Parents may need reassurance during this time of transition to someone else sharing the care of their baby. Separation usually is hard, and the parent may feel guilty and will need to be able to trust or receive sup\u00ad port from family members and the child care provider. Changes in routine and separation also may be hard on the infant, and parents may find it helpful to spend extra time comforting the infant during the transition. Sample Questions What have you done about locating someone for child care when you return to work or school, need to run errands, or go out with family? Are you comfortable with these arrangements? How do you feel now about leaving your baby with someone else? Have you talked with your child care provider about your baby's routines and how to let you know how your baby did during the day? Anticipatory Guidance XWe can give you suggestions about how to find good child care, if you wish. Standards for child care exist. Y ou should look for licensed child care centers and family child care centers that meet specific criteria. It is important to visit and spend time in any setting where you will be leaving your baby to make sure you know how it operates. XY ou can expect a good child care provider to have good infection control practices in place and to give you a daily activity report about your baby's feedings, sleep, play, and elimination. XIt is not uncommon for mothers to have strong feelings about leaving their baby. Knowing that your baby is with someone you trust and who will take good care of her is a very important first step.

Mothers at this stage may feel sad, exhausted, frustrated, discouraged, or disappointed in their ability to care for their infant. Health care professionals should take into account economic pressures on the family, the need for the mother to return to work quickly, the need to care for other children, and neighborhood issues, such as safety and lack of sidewalks and recreational space. Provide phone numbers and contact information if the mother expresses any concerns about taking care of herself, and provide follow\u00adup to ensure that she is able to access these resources. Sample Questions To both parents: How are you feeling? To the mother: Have you had a postpartum checkup? Did you discuss family-planning arrangements at this checkup? With your partner? What have you heard from your obstetrician about resuming your normal daily activities after delivery? What do you do to take care of yourself? Anticipatory Guidance XBecause your role as parents requires both physical and emotional energy, you must take care of your \u00ad selves so you can care for your baby. Depression An estimated 10% to 20% of women struggle with major depression before, during, and after delivery of a baby. Perinatal depression has substantial personal consequences and interferes with quality of child\u00ad rearing, adversely affecting parent\u00adinfant interactions, maternal responsiveness to infant vocalizations and gestures, and other stimulation essential for optimal child development. Because pregnancy and childbirth are supposed to be a joyous occasion, women may feel that they are going to be bad mothers if they are depressed. It is important for apprehensive patients to understand what postpartum depression is, know that many women experience similar feelings, and realize that untreated postpartum depression may have adverse effects on women's health and their baby's health and development.

Do you find that you are drinking, using herbs, or taking drugs to help make you feel less depressed, less anxious, less frustrated, and calmer? Who has been available to assist you at home? Who has been the most help to you? Anticipatory Guidance XMany mothers feel tired or overwhelmed in the first weeks at home. These feelings should not continue, however. If you find that you are still feeling very tired or overwhelmed, or you are using over \u00adthe\u00ad counter or prescription medication, drugs, or alcohol to feel better, let your partner, your own health care professional, or me know so that you can get the help you need. Sibling Relationships Sibling adjustment is a process over time and not yet complete at only 2 months of age. Behavior regres\u00adsion and jealousy sometimes occur and are normal. Parents can help older siblings by including them in the care of the new baby in developmentally appropri\u00ad ate ways. Reading, talking, and singing together assures older siblings of their importance to parents and their value in the family. Sample Questions How are your other children? Are you able to spend time with each of them individually? Anticipatory Guidance XOne of the ways that you can meet the needs of your other children is by appropriately engaging them in the care of the baby. Having them bring supplies and hold the baby's hand are 2 ways they can help. Giving them a \"baby doll\" of their own to hold, feed, and diaper is important; so is setting aside regular one\u00adon\u00adone time with your other children to read, talk, and do things together.

Parent uncertainty or nervousness, an uninvolved partner, or a statement that caring for the baby is \"work, \" without relaxed or pleasant moments, requires further exploration and counseling. Additionally, a lack of parental involvement, as shown by a lack of questions about the baby and her development, or a demeanor of sadness, withdrawal, or anger, should trigger further exploration and counseling. Sample Questions What do you and your partner enjoy most about your baby? What are some of your best times of day with her? What are you enjoying about caring for your baby? What is challenging about caring for your baby? Has your child care provider expressed any concerns about your baby's development? Anticipatory Guidance XAt 2 months of age, your baby is beginning be alert and awake for longer stretches of time. She also will begin to respond more actively to you now by smiling and babbling. Make the most of this new devel\u00ad opment by cuddling, talking, and playing with your baby. XIt is important to know that a young infant cannot be \"spoiled\" by holding, cuddling, and rocking her, or by talking and singing to her.

Resources for parents to learn infant mas\u00adsage can be provided if parents are interested. Sample Questions What sounds does your baby make? Does the baby startle or respond to sounds and voices? Does she look at you and watch you as you move your face when you talk? What do you think your baby is feeling and trying to tell you? How does it make you feel? How do you know what your baby wants? Have you noticed any differences in her cries? How would you describe your baby's personality? How does she respond to you? Is it easy or hard to know what she wants? What does your baby do with her hands? Anticipatory Guidance XResponding to your baby's sounds by making sounds, too, and by showing your face as you talk, encourages her to \"talk back, \" especially during dressing, bathing, feeding, playing, and walking. This kind of \"turn taking\" is a foundation of language and conversation. Singing and talking during these typical daily routines also encourages language, as does reading aloud, looking at books, and talking about the pictures. Gradually, your baby will increase the variety and frequency of the sounds she makes as well as how she responds to sounds, especially her parents' voices. XIt is important to understand and recognize your infant's early temperament and personality so that you know how to adjust to meet her needs. As you learn about her temperament and the way she processes sensory stimulation, such as whether she is active, quiet, sensitive, demanding, or easily distracted, you will be better able to understand how it affects the way your baby relates to the world. XGetting in tune with your baby's likes and dislikes also can help you feel comfortable and confident in your abilities as a parent. Infant massage is a helpful way for you to understand what your baby likes or dislikes. It can help you calm and relax her, and it enhances your baby's ability to go to sleep easily. Infant massage also offers important health and developmental benefits for premature infants and babies with special health care needs. It helps them sleep, regulate, and organize their waking and sleeping patterns, and promotes muscle tone and infant movement.

Sample Questions How is your baby sleeping? What are some of your favorite routines with your baby? Anticipatory Guidance XY our baby is still developing regular sleep patterns. Help her by paying attention to her cues for sleep and by sticking to a regular schedule for naps and nighttime sleep. Infant irritability usually is caused by lack of sleep. XBy this point, you may be waiting for your baby to sleep through the night. It's normal for babies this age to continue to wake frequently at night. Placing your baby in her crib in a drowsy state encourages her to learn to sleep on her own. Media As more families and children have access to and exposure to digital media, it is important to assess for the use of such devices and offer guidance regarding media in the home. Sample Question Is there a TV or other digital media device on in the background while your baby is in the room? Anticipatory Guidance XBabies this young should not watch TV or other digital media. Some parents try to calm their fussy babies by sitting them in front of a TV show or video, but this may make them fussier in the long run, and doesn't help them learn ways to soothe themselves. Try other ways to soothe your baby when she is fussy, such as taking a walk, holding her in a carrier, decreasing the amount of stimulation and noise in the home, or using infant massage; or, ask someone else to hold the baby and take a break. XHaving a TV on in the background can distract you from reading your baby's cues. Reading infant cues is important to learning about your baby's patterns of behavior and developing sensitive interactions with the baby. These interactions between you and your baby are crucial for language, cognitive, and emotional development.

During the physical examination, demonstrate how the infant will try to grasp objects held close to her hand and learn to put her hands in her mouth, which aids in self\u00adconsoling. Sample Question Physical activity is important for all of us, even young children. How is your baby moving about now? Anticipatory Guidance XWhen babies are awake, they enjoy looking around their environment and moving their bodies. One of the first skills babies must learn is holding their head up. One of the ways babies learn to do this is through tummy time. Although babies need to sleep on their backs, we want to encourage them to play on their tummies. Tummy time also can help prevent the development of a flat area on the back of the head. Fussiness Counsel parents that the infant's crying may increase at this age, but the crying spells will decrease over time. Parents may need strategies that will help them find ways to console their baby, and they need to be counseled about the fragility of an infant's head. Help parents understand that they are teaching the infant to trust that she will be cared for when they quickly respond to their infant's crying. This responsiveness will not spoil the infant, as many parents believe. The safest cover for the infant is a sleepsack or footed sleeper, which can keep the baby warm without the concern of suffocation from a blanket. Swaddling is discouraged after 2 months of age. Putting their hands to their mouth and sucking is an important self\u00adcomforting strategy used by infants, and it is an important step in self\u00adregulation. Explain that this strategy helps infants with the earliest feel\u00ad ings of competence and mastery. If the infant is very irritable, parents need to find a way to avoid frustration. They need to be cautioned to never shake their infant or leave her with someone who may harm her, because it causes severe, perma\u00ad nent brain damage. Provide telephone numbers for local community resources that can help parents. Sample Questions How much is your baby crying? How often? What are some of the ways you have found to calm your baby when she is crying? What do you do if that does not work? Do you still swaddle your baby? Do you ever feel that you or other caregivers may hurt the baby? What makes you feel that way? How do you handle the feeling?

Many babies have fussy periods in the late afternoon or evening. These are normal. There are many possible strategies for calming your baby, including just being there with her, talking, patting or stroking, bundling or containing, holding, wearing in a sling or carrier, and rocking. Other calming strategies include caressing or dancing with your infant, walking with her in a carriage or stroller, and going on car rides. Remember that your baby is not trying to make you angry\u2014she is just having a rough time and still needs someone to be there. Ask a family member, neighbor, or trusted friend to stay with your crying baby for a few minutes to allow you to take a break. If you are alone, you can try putting the baby in her crib, closing the door, and checking on her every few minutes. XIt is no longer safe to swaddle your baby unless you are holding her in your arms. If your baby rolls to her tummy while swaddled tightly, she may not be able to move her head and keep her airway open. This can increase her risk of suffocation. XAt this age, your baby is developing the ability to put her hands to her mouth, suck on her fingers or her thumb, or use a pacifier. This is one of the ways your baby will learn to calm herself, and it is normal, age\u00adappropriate behavior. She will use these methods until she is able to use other self\u00adcalming strategies. XNever, ever, shake your baby or otherwise harm your baby, because it could cause permanent injury, including brain damage. If you ever feel that you need help because your baby is crying so much, contact me or other community resources that can help you.

Infants who are struggling with maintaining a good growth pattern or parents who are struggling with feeding routines, extremely long feedings, or infrequent feedings should have additional support, guidance, and counseling to determine potential underlying infant developmental concerns or parenting knowledge issues. Sample Questions How is your baby's feeding going? Tell me about all the foods and fluids you are offering your baby. What questions or concerns do you have about feeding? Anticipatory Guidance XExclusive breastfeeding for about the first 6 months of life provides ideal nutrition and supports the best possible growth and development. If you are still breastfeeding, congratulations! XIf your baby is not breastfed, iron\u00adfortified formula is the recommended substitute during the first year of life. XDo not give your baby food other than breast milk or formula until he is developmentally ready, which is at about 6 months of age. XUsually, healthy babies do not require extra water. On very hot days with no air condi tioning, babies will benefit from some extra water. Breast milk and formula, when properly prepared, are adequate to meet the baby's fluid needs. Juice is not recommended.

Sample Questions How do you know if your baby is hungry? How do you know if he has had enough to eat? How easily does your baby burp during or after a feeding? Anticipatory Guidance XBreastfed and formula\u00adfed infants have different needs for the frequency of feeding, although both breast milk and formula provide all the nutrition that infants need until about 6 months of age. XTo prevent overfeeding, which often leads to more frequent spit\u00adups, recognize your baby's individual signs of hunger and fullness. An infant's stomach is still small. Therefore, your baby still needs to eat every 2 to 4 hours, even during the night. Hopefully, your baby will have one longer stretch at night of 4 to 5 hours without feeding. XBurp your baby at natural breaks, such as midway through or after a feeding, by gently rubbing or pat\u00adting his back while holding him against your shoulder and chest or supporting him in a sitting position on your lap. Breastfeeding Guidance Explain that as infants grow, they are more easily distracted during feeding and may need gentle repetitive stimulation, such as rocking, patting, or stroking. The infant may need a quiet environment, perhaps with low lighting and without other people present. Feeding times offer a wonderful opportunity for social interaction between the infant and the mother. Counsel mothers on safe storage of human milk.Vitamin D supplementation (400 IU per day) is recommended for all full\u00adterm breastfed infants beginning at hospital discharge. Breastfed preterm or low birth weight infants will need multivitamin drops and iron supplementation at 2 mg/kg/day by 2 to 6 weeks of age until solid food introduction. Sample Questions How is breastfeeding going for you and your baby? Is your baby breastfeeding exclusively? If not, what else is the baby getting? Do you need any help with breastfeeding? Does it seem like your baby is breastfeeding more often or for longer periods of time? In what ways is breastfeeding different now from when you were last here? How can you tell if your baby is satisfied at the breast? Is your child care provider supporting your breastfeeding efforts? Are you planning to return to work or school? If so, will you express your breast milk? Does your school or workplace have a place where you can pump your milk in privacy? How will you store your milk? How long will you keep it? Do you eat fish at least 1 to 2 times per week? Do you have protein-containing foods every day, such as eggs, chicken, beef or pork, or dairy? Are you able to be physically active most days?

They may feed more frequently when they go through growth spurts. By 3 months of age, breastfed infants generally will be feed\u00ad ing every 2 to 3 hours. If your baby is receiving frequent feedings during the day and continuing to receive between 8 and 12 feedings in 24 hours, he may have one longer stretch of 4 to 5 hours at night between feedings. XConsider how to plan your activities and schedules to make things easier when you are home or out with your baby. Storing breast milk properly is very important. If you are interested, I can give you written guidelines to help you make sure your stored breast milk remains safe for your baby. XI can help you with strategies to support breast milk production if you will be away from the baby for extended periods. XIf you are breastfeeding your baby, be sure that you are giving him vitamin D drops. XY ou may continue to take your prenatal vitamin with iron every day to ensure adequate intake of vita\u00admins or minerals. Discuss with your obstetric team how long you should continue to take it. If you do not consume any animal products in your diet and follow a vegan diet, your supplement should include vitamins D and B 12 as well as iron and zinc. XEating a small serving of fish 2 times a week provides important nutrients for your baby. Canned light tuna, salmon, trout, and herring are the best choices to give your baby the neuro behavioral benefits of an adequate intake of an important fat called DHA. XIt is best to avoid 4 kinds of fish that are high in mercury. These fish are tilefish, shark, swordfish, and king mackerel. XConsuming small amounts of protein\u00ad containing foods, like lean meat, poultry, dairy products, beans and peas, eggs, processed soy products, and nuts and seeds, every day is recommended.

Parents also may need to be reminded not to put the baby to bed with a bottle. The usual amount of formula for a 2\u00admonth\u00adold in 24 hours is about 26 to 28 oz, with a range of 21 to 32 oz. Sample Questions How is formula feeding going for you and your baby? What formula do you use? Is the formula fortified with iron? How often does your baby feed? How much does he drink at a feeding? Have you offered your baby anything other than formula? What questions or concerns do you have about the formula, such as cost, preparation, and nutrient content? How do you hold your baby when you feed him? Do you ever prop the bottle to feed or put your baby to bed with the bottle? Anticipatory Guidance XBabies who receive formula usually will feed every 3 to 4 hours, with one longer stretch at night of up to 5 or 6 hours at night between feedings. Overall, a 2\u00admonth\u00adold still needs about 6 to 8 feedings in 24 hours. XWhen feeding your baby, always hold him in your arms in a partly upright position. This will prevent him from choking and will allow you to look into his eyes during feedings. Feeding is a wonderful opportunity for warm and loving interaction with your baby. XDo not prop a bottle in your baby's mouth or put him to bed with a bottle containing juice, milk, or other sugary liquid. Propping and putting him to bed with a bottle increases the risk of choking and of developing early tooth decay. XNever heat a bottle in a microwave. If you wish to warm a bottle, a hot water bath is recommended.

Sample Question Do you have any questions about using your car safety seat? Anticipatory Guidance XA rear \u00adfacing car safety seat that is properly secured in the back seat should always be used to transport your baby in all vehicles, including taxis and cars owned by friends or other family members. XNever place your baby's car safety seat in the front seat of a vehicle with a passenger air bag because air bags deploy with great force. When it hits a car safety seat, it causes serious injury or death. XCar safety seats should be used only for travel, not for positioning outside the vehicle. Keep the har \u00ad nesses snug whenever your baby is in the car safety seat. This will help prevent falls out of the seat and strangulation on the harnesses. XY our own safe driving behaviors are important to the health of your children.

The infant should sleep in a crib, bassinet, or cradle in the same room as the parents. Infants should not share a bed with par \u00ad ents or any other caregivers or children. A pacifier should be offered when the baby is falling asleep. At the same time, health care professionals should be aware of parents' cultural traditions and beliefs about infant sleep and sleep location. Sample Questions Where does your baby sleep? What position does your baby sleep in? Is your baby having any difficulty sleeping on her back? Do you provide your child with a pacifier when she falls asleep? Where does your baby sleep when in child care? Anticipatory Guidance XDon't forget to reduce the risk of sudden infant death, by following \"back to sleep\" and \" tummy to play. \" Make sure that any others who put your baby down to sleep also follow back to sleep. XY our baby should sleep in your room in her own crib, but not in your bed. XOffer your baby a pacifier when she is falling asleep. XThe room temperature should be kept comfortable. Make sure your baby doesn't get too warm or cold while sleeping. XIf possible, use a crib purchased after June 28, 2011, as cribs sold in the United States after that date are required to meet a new, stronger safety standard. If you use an older crib, choose one with slats that are no more than 23 8 inches (60 mm) apart and with a mattress that fits snugly, with no gaps between the mattress and the crib slats. Drop\u00adside cribs should never be used. XIf you choose a mesh play yard or portable crib, consider choosing one that was manufactured after a new, stronger safety standard was implemented on February 28, 2013. If you use an older product, the weave should have openings less than \u00bc inch (6 mm) and the sides should always stay fully raised. XIf your baby is cared for by others, such as in a child care setting or with a relative, be sure to emphasize the importance of safe sleep practices with that caregiver. BFG 4TH ED.indb 431 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents432 INFANCY 2 MONTH VISITSafe Home Environment: Burns, Drowning, and Falls As the baby develops more fine and gross motor skills, it is important to review with the parents how to keep the home environment safe. Discuss the importance of not leaving the baby alone in a tub of water\u2014 even for a second\u2014even when using a bath seat. Also, the baby should never be left unattended in high places, such as changing tables, beds, sofas, or chairs. Safety issues apply to all homes where the baby spends time, including child care and at grand parents' and friends' homes. Sample Question Have you made any changes in your home to keep your baby safe? Anticipatory Guidance XDo not drink hot liquids while holding the baby. XTo protect your child from tap water scalds, the hottest temperature at the faucet should be no higher than 120\u00b0F. In many cases, you can adjust your water heater. Before bathing the baby, always test the water temperature with your wrist to make sure it is not too hot. XNever leave your baby alone in a tub of water, even for a moment. A bath seat or bath ring is not a safety device and is not a substitute for adult supervision. Y our baby can drown in even a few inches of water, including in the bathtub, play pools, buckets, or toilets. A supervising adult should be within an arm's reach, providing \"touch supervision, \" whenever babies are in or around water. XLeaving the baby on a changing table, couch, infant seat, or bed is never safe because of your baby's ability to roll or push off. At this age, your baby's legs are getting stronger now and her newborn reflexes that prevent rolling over are gradually fading away. Because your baby is now bigger and stronger, it is important to always keep one hand on the baby when changing diapers or clothing on a changing table, couch, or bed, especially as she begins to roll over. XDo not put your baby in a bouncy seat, recliner, or positioning seat on an elevated surface like a coun\u00ad tertop or coffee table. Keep these devices on the floor when they are in use. BFG 4TH ED.indb 432 1/20/17 2:47 PM433 INFANCY FIRST WEEK VISIT (3 TO 5 DAYS)INFANCY 1 MONTH VISITINFANCY 4 MONTH VISITThe relationship between parents and their 4\u00admonth\u00adold is pleasurable and rewarding. The baby's ability to smile, coo, and laugh encourages her parents to talk and play with her. Clear and predictable cues from the infant are met with appropriate and predictable responses from her parents, promoting mutual trust. During this period, the infant masters early motor, language, and social skills by interacting with those who care for her. The infant's fussiness should begin to decrease as she develops self\u00adconsoling skills and improved self\u00adregulation. If crying is still a concern, parents need additional specific strategies for calming their baby. An irritable child who cries frequently or does not sleep through the night may clash tem\u00ad peramentally with a family that values regularity and tranquility. Evaluation of the infant's temper \u00ad ament and parent temperament may be needed to help the parents understand the importance of these strategies. Responding to the sights and sounds around her, the 4\u00admonth\u00adold raises her body from a prone position with her arms and holds her head steady. She may be so interested in her world that she sometimes refuses to settle down to eat. She may stop feeding from the breast or bottle after just a minute or so to check out what else is happening in the room. Parents may need to feed her in a quiet, darkened room for the next few weeks. Milk is still sufficient nutrition, but parents may begin to ask about introducing solid foods. Infants become developmentally ready to start eating solid foods by about 6 months of age. Keep in mind that every baby is different and if a baby was born premature, her adjusted age should be used for any recommendations. Parents may have been told to start giving their babies cereal and other solid foods much earlier in life, often in an attempt to help their babies sleep longer at night, despite evi\u00ad dence to the contrary. Some families may wish to begin introducing solid foods before 6 months of age because the baby's ability to become an active participant in eating solid foods is growing, as is her physiological ability to handle these foods. As key social and motor abilities become apparent at 4 months of age, the infant who appears to have a delay in achieving these skills may benefit from a formal developmental assessment. If develop \u00ad mental delays are found, exploring their origin and making referrals for early intervention will be important. Most employed mothers will have returned to work by the time their infant is 4 months old, and it is important that the child care arrange\u00adments be of high quality and work well for both the infant and the family. Family problems, such as inadequate finances, few social supports, or low parental self\u00adesteem, may impair the parents' ability to nurture. It is important that parents seek help when they feel sad, discouraged, depressed, overwhelmed, or inadequate.

Tools and handouts to support anticipatory guid\u00adance can be found in the Bright Futures Tool and Resource Kit. Risks: Environmental Risk (Lead) Explain the risks of lead and discuss strategies for minimizing this risk. It is important to plan for creating a safe environment for the infant as mobility increases and he spends more time on the floor. Work\u00adrelated exposures, such as working in a battery plant, or home\u00adrelated exposures, such as renovating an old home that has lead\u00adbased paint, can bring lead into the home through the clothing or body of the person doing the work. Sample Questions Do you know how to assess the risk of lead poisoning in your home? Do you or anyone else in your household work outside the home in an environment where there might be concerns about exposure to harmful substances, such as lead? Anticipatory Guidance XLead can be found in the paint of older homes (built before 1978), pottery and pewter, folk medicines, insecticides, industry, and hobbies, as well as other sources. Lead is toxic, and it is important to be aware of any sources of lead in your home to prevent lead exposure for your family. XLead dust can come into your home on your clothes or body of people who work with lead. After some\u00ad one finishes a task that involves working with lead\u00adbased products, such as renovating older housing, stained glass work, bullet making, or using a firing range, they should change their clothes before they enter the home and shower as soon as they return home.

Parents who are juggling work or school and child care and parenting may be less likely to find this time as enjoyable and may begin to feel the stress of their many responsibilities. Staying in touch with family and friends helps to avoid social isolation. Inquire about who helps them with their child. If fewer than 3 sources of help are offered, ask parents what family lives nearby, and about neighbors with children and friends from work, faith\u00adbased groups, or child care. Sample Questions What do you do when problems really get to you? Who do you turn to at times like that? How are you and your partner getting along together? Have you and your partner been able to find time alone? Who helps you care for your infant? How are your other children doing? Do you spend time with each of them individually? Who helps you take care of your baby? Anticipatory Guidance XStay in touch with friends and family members. It will help you avoid social isolation. XTalk to me or another health care professional if you and your partner are in conflict. XTake some time for yourself and spend some individual time with your partner. XMake sure you meet the needs of your other children by spending time with them each day doing things they like to do. Help them enjoy the baby by appropriately engaging them in the care of the baby, such as by bringing you supplies or holding the baby's hand. XIf you have few people in your family or at home who can help you care for your child, consider asking neighbors with children, friends from work, faith \u00adbased groups, or child care providers.

Provide written material or con\u00ad tact information for community resources that are available to assist parents in identifying family home care or child care centers that meet their requirements. Parents of children with special needs often will have significant difficulty locating child care resources and, therefore, may particularly benefit from being connected to local public health resources as well as contacts through the local Early Intervention Program agency, often referred to as IDEA Part C. These contacts can help with developmental concerns and also for links to other community resources. Sample Questions Have you returned to work or school, or do you plan to do so? What are your child care arrangements? Who takes care of the baby when you go out? How are your child care arrangements working out for you? Do you feel they are supporting your efforts to breastfeed your baby? Do they give you a daily report on your baby's activities, including feeding, elimination, sleep, and playtime? Anticipatory Guidance XIf you are returning to work, talk with me or another health care professional about child care arrange\u00adments and your feelings about leaving your baby. Choose babysitters and caregivers who are mature, trained, responsible, and recommended by someone you trust. XGetting a report from your child care provider helps you to stay connected to your child during his day. This also helps you to continue with the same routine and schedule. When it works for you, observe your baby and spend time at the child care setting. This may reassure you about the care he is getting.

Setting up a variety of play activities so that the infant can be moved easily from one to the other is often helpful in adjusting for the infant's increasing awake time and short attention span. As they try to console their baby, sometimes unsuccessfully, parents begin to recognize that their baby may not always be consolable. Discuss additional strategies for calming the infant when this occurs. Swaddling is no longer recommended at this age, with evidence that it increases the risk of suffocating, leading to SUID. Sample Questions What do you do to calm your baby? What do you do if that does not work? Do you ever feel that you or other caregivers may hurt the baby? What will you do if you feel this way? Do you have a plan? How do you handle the feeling? Anticipatory Guidance XIf your baby is being very fussy and you have checked that she is fed, clean, and safe and you are begin\u00ad ning to get upset and frustrated, put the baby in her crib and give yourself a break\u2014make a cup of tea or call a friend. Babies cry a lot at this age; it gets better as they get older. Crying won't hurt your baby. If this happens consistently, though, call me for advice. Parent-Infant Communication As parents learn about their infant through observing her behaviors, they are able to respond appropriately to her ever \u00adchanging needs. Helping parents have \"watchful wonder\" about their baby's behaviors allows them to discover the uniqueness of their baby's own temperament and sensory processing, and how it affects the way she relates to the world. To demonstrate this watchful wonder, during the physical examina\u00ad tion, describe the infant's behaviors and responses to being handled and engaged in play. This can lead to a discussion about what is developmentally appropriate and, if needed, when and how it is appropriate to redirect the infant's behavior. Sample Questions Tell me about your baby. What do you like best about her? What does your partner enjoy most about her? What do you think your baby is trying to tell you when she cries, looks at you, turns away, or smiles?

Each baby has a unique way of com\u00ad municating. By watching your baby closely, and how she responds to you and the world around her, you become the expert on your baby and the best way to meet her needs. XAs you begin to understand and recognize your infant's temperament and personality, you also will begin to feel more comfortable in knowing how to adjust your responses to meet her needs. This also will help your baby better understand how she relates to the world. XIt is important to know that an infant cannot be \"spoiled\" by holding, cuddling, and rocking her, or by talking and singing to her. Spending time playing and talking with your baby helps to strengthen the parent\u00adchild relationship by building trust between you and your baby. Consistent Daily Routines To receive adequate calories, most 4\u00admonth\u00adolds continue to wake at night for feeding. Parents often see the infant not sleeping through the night as a problem, and they want solutions. This visit is a good time to explore the importance of a consistent daily routine and its effect on sleep, typical sleep patterns, ways to establish a good sleep routine, and the overall relationship among feeding, sleep, and play activities. Also, it may be important to clarify sleeping through the night. Some parents may expect an infant to sleep 12 hours at night, although actually having a longer stretch of sleep for 5 to 6 hours is more typical. Parents who describe infants with inconsistent and unpredictable behaviors, or parents who are unable to describe their baby's schedule, may need additional monitoring and intervention. Discuss difficulties integrating the routines of the infant with that of scheduling demands of older siblings and family members. Sample Questions What type of daily routine do you have for your baby? How long is your baby sleeping at night? Do you have a bedtime routine for your baby? Anticipatory Guidance XCreating a daily routine for feedings and naps and a bedtime routine is a good idea because they will help establish eventual longer sleeping stretches at night. XIt also is important to help your baby learn to put herself to sleep by placing her in her crib when she is drowsy, talking gently to her, and even patting her to sleep. XContinuing to provide regular structure and routines for the baby will increase her sense of security.

Discuss alternatives to infants watching TV . Discourage any TV , computer, tablet, smartphone, or viewing or play for children at this age. Sample Question Is there a TV or other digital media device on in the background while your baby is in the room? Anticipatory Guidance XBabies this young should not watch TV or videos. Some parents try to calm their fussy babies by sitting them in front of a TV show or video, but this may make them fussier in the long run, and doesn't help them learn ways to soothe themselves. Try other ways to soothe your baby when she is fussy, such as taking a walk, holding her in a carrier, decreasing the amount of stimulation and noise in the home, or using infant massage; or, ask someone else to hold the baby and take a break. XHaving a TV on in the background can distract you from reading your baby's cues. Reading infant cues is important to learning about your baby's patterns of behavior and developing sensitive interactions with the baby. These interactions between you and your baby are crucial for language, cognitive, and emotional development. Playtime Counsel parents on the steps in development that are likely to occur during the next 2 months, based on the baby's current development and how the daily physical activities of the baby encourage normal devel\u00ad opment. Encourage parents to use both active and quiet playtime. Babies who are described as excessively active or extremely quiet should be monitored. Management assis\u00ad tance is extremely important for parents who are sad or unhappy, or who rarely sleep. Consider referring parents for mental health evaluation and treatment. Health care professionals can use the physical examination to demonstrate the integration of the newborn reflexes and emergence of the protective reflexes, and discuss what these reflexes, plus the infant's head control and sitting with support, mean in terms of the infant's ability to roll over and sit. As the infant improves her ability to move on her own, parents must begin to use extra caution about protecting her from rolling off the bed or couch or changing table. During the physical examination, demonstrate the protective reflexes, if emerging. Sample Questions What are some of your baby's new achievements? What are some of your baby's favorite activities? Favorite toys? How is she getting around now? How is \"tummy time\" working for your baby? How have you been able to fit together your physical activities with the baby? How would you describe your baby's personality? How does she act around other people? Is she responsive or withdrawn with family members?

Quiet playtime activities include reading or sing\u00ad ing to your baby or sitting together outside in the park. For active playtime activities, give your baby age\u00adappropriate toys to play with, such as a floor play gym so that, when she is placed on her back, she can reach for the toys or kick them with her feet. Another choice is a colorful blanket, a mirror, or toys for her to look at when she is on her tummy. Make sure your baby has safe opportunities to explore her environment. XBabies at 4 months of age find that interacting with their parents is their favorite activity. Their emerg\u00ading social play and interaction can be a delight, but also frustrating for parents who are balancing other responsibilities. Understanding ways to engage your baby in activities, even for a short time, will help provide some time to accomplish your other responsibilities.

Therefore, it is important to discuss this with parents. Sample Questions When was your last dental checkup? What is your daily dental care routine? Anticipatory Guidance XSharing spoons and cleaning a dropped pacifier in your mouth may increase the growth of bacteria in your baby's mouth and increase the risk that he will develop tooth decay, also called dental caries, when his teeth come in. XTo protect your child's eventual dental health, it is important for you to maintain good dental health. Because you may be the source of caries\u00adpromoting bacteria for your baby, it is important you visit the dentist, reduce the amount of sugary drinks in your diet, take careful care of your teeth through brush\u00ad ing and flossing, and use a fluoridated toothpaste or rinse. Teething and Drooling Teething typically begins between 4 and 7 months of age. This is an appropriate time to address the family's concerns. Describe the teething syndrome and its management. Sample Question Is your baby beginning to drool? Anticipatory Guidance XIf your baby is teething, he may drool, become fussy, or put things in his mouth. A cold, not frozen, teething ring may help ease his discomfort. Talk with me if his symptoms persist.

Anticipatory Guidance XTo avoid developing a habit that will harm your baby's teeth, do not put him to bed with a bottle con\u00adtaining juice, milk, or other sugary liquid. Always hold your baby for a bottle\u00adfeeding and do not prop the bottle in his mouth or allow him to graze, meaning drinking from a bottle at will during the day. When you begin feeding your baby, at around 6 months of age, avoid baby foods or juices that are sucked out of a bag or pouch. A baby's teeth and gums will be in contact with the pureed food longer than necessary, which can lead to tooth decay. It's always best to use a spoon. XUse a soft cloth or soft toothbrush with tap water and a small smear of fluoridated toothpaste, no more than a grain of rice, to gently clean your baby's gums and any teeth that develop. This should be done twice a day\u2014after the baby's last feeding before nighttime sleep, and then again in the morning.

Babies continue to gain about \u00bd pound a week, or 2 pounds a month. Their feedings may become less frequent, with 6 to 10 feedings in 24 hours. Only one parent might be present at this visit and a complete feeding history may not be available. This is particularly true if the infant is in child care. If there are concerns with feeding, irritability, or weight gain, it may be advisable to have the parents work together with the child care provider to complete a 24\u00adhour or 3\u00adday diet history that can be reviewed for nutritional adequacy. A referral can be made to a dietitian, if needed. Sample Questions How is feeding going? What questions or concerns do you have about feeding? Tell me about what you are feeding your baby. How often are you feeding your baby? How much does she take at a feeding? About how long does a feeding last? Are you feeding your baby any foods besides breast milk or formula? Anticipatory Guidance XExclusive breastfeeding provides the ideal source of nutrition for all infants for about the first 6 months of life. For those infants who are not breastfed, iron\u00adfortified formula is the recommended sub\u00ad stitute. XFormula\u00adfed infants do not need vitamin supplements if the formula is fortified with iron and the baby is consuming an adequate volume of formula for appropriate growth. Feeding Choices (Avoid Grazing) Parents continue to need reassurance that their infant is getting enough to eat when feeding patterns change because of a temporary increase in the frequency of feedings caused by growth spurts. Discuss the meaning of the growth chart and the relationship between the infant's birth weight and current weight and length. As babies learn that they can put their hands in their mouth for chewing and sucking, they use this tech\u00ad nique to calm themselves. Some parents think this means their baby is still hungry and they use it as a rationale for starting solid foods. Solid foods are not recommended until about 6 months of age. Vitamin D (400 IU) supplements are recommended for all breastfed infants, but are not needed for formula\u00adfed infants because vitamin D is present in the formula. Some preterm infants will require supplementation of additional vitamins. Oral iron supplementation (1 mg/kg/day) should be provided to exclusively breastfed infants beginning at 4 months of age and should continue until iron\u00ad and zinc\u00adrich complementary foods (baby meats and Priority Nutrition and Feeding General guidance on feeding, feeding choices (avoid grazing), delaying solid foods, breastfeeding guid- ance, supplements 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents450 INFANCY FIRST WEEK VISIT (3 TO 5 DAYS)INFANCY 4 MONTH VISITiron\u00adfortified cereals) are introduced. It may take 1 to 2 months following introduction of these foods for infants to consume sufficient iron from complementary foods alone. Red meat is a better source of iron than iron\u00adfortified cereals for older infants because a higher percentage of the iron in red meat is absorbed. At 4 months, babies become very interested in their environment and it is not uncommon for them to vig\u00ad orously begin a feeding and then become distracted by siblings or other activities in the environment and not complete a feeding. However, in an hour or so they begin to fuss because they are hungry again. Sample Questions How long does a typical feeding last now? How long between feedings? Do you feel that your baby finishes a feeding in one sitting or eats small amounts and then is hungry again in about an hour? Are you continuing to provide vitamin D? Anticipatory Guidance XIt is important for you to help your baby avoid getting into the habit of grazing or snacking and then cry\u00ad ing to be fed again soon. For breastfed babies, this may not be uncommon, however, when they are going through a growth spurt. The difference is that a growth spurt does not usually last more than a week. XBe sure to continue your baby's vitamin D supplement. An iron supplement is now also necessary and we will begin it today. XTo help your baby finish a feeding, it may help to find a quiet and less distractible environment. XIn addition, because your baby loves to see your face, watch your expressions, and hear your voice, you can be the most interesting thing to watch while feeding. Position your baby so that she can see your face, and talk with her about her feeding, what is going on around her, and what will happen during the day. Y ou can use touch, changes in your voice, and even slight changes in her position to help her refo\u00ad cus on feeding. Delaying Solid Foods At 4 months of age, human milk or formula remains the best food for babies. Solid feeding is discouraged until about 6 months of age. Sample Question Have you thought about when you will know that your baby is ready to begin solid foods? Anticipatory Guidance XExclusive breastfeeding for about the first 6 months of life provides ideal nutrition and supports the best possible growth and development. XIf your baby is not breastfed, iron\u00adfortified formula is the recommended substitute during the first year of life. XDo not give your baby food other than breast milk or formula until she is developmentally ready, which is at about 6 months of age. XUsually, healthy babies do not require extra water. On very hot days with no air conditioning, she will benefit from some extra water. Breast milk and formula, when properly prepared, are adequate to meet your baby's fluid needs. Juice is not recommended.

Reinforce that exclusive breastfeeding is the ideal source of nutrition for about the first 6 months of age, followed, as solid foods are introduced, by continued breast\u00ad feeding for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by the mother and child. Discuss how demand for more frequent breastfeeding is usually related to an infant's growth spurt and is nature's way of increasing human milk supply. If an increased demand continues for a few days, is not affected by increased breastfeeding, and is unrelated to illness, teething, or changes in routine, it may be a sign that the breastfed infant is ready for solid foods. Counsel mothers on safe storage of human milk. Sample Questions How is breastfeeding going for you and your baby? In what ways is breastfeeding different now from when you were last here? How often does your baby breastfeed? Does it seem as though she is breastfeeding more often or for longer periods of time? How can you tell whether your baby is satisfied at the breast? Has she received breast milk or other fluids from a bottle? How are you storing pumped breast milk? Anticipatory Guidance XCongratulations for continuing to breastfeed your baby! It is not unusual for babies to go through growth spurts during the first year of life and, whenever this occurs, your baby will begin to breastfeed more frequently, and often at night. This is nature's way of increasing your milk supply. This is a tempo\u00ad rary situation and it does not indicate that your baby is not getting enough to eat. XStoring breast milk properly is very important. If you are interested, I can give you written guidelines to help you make sure your stored breast milk remains safe for your baby. XAs your baby gets closer to 6 months of age, you may begin to see signs that she is ready for solid foods. Supplements and Over-the-counter Medications Medications and supplements often pass through the human milk to the baby. It is important to know what supplements and over \u00adthe\u00adcounter medications mothers are taking. Assess their safety for the infant. Sample Question Do you take any supplements, herbs, vitamins, or medications? Anticipatory Guidance XIt is important to tell me about any medications, supplements, herbs, or vitamins you may be taking. This information will help me give you the best care and advice since you are breastfeeding. However, some medications may decrease your milk supply. Knowing what you are taking helps me determine whether they are safe with medications or treatments your baby might receive. XMost medications are compatible with breastfeeding, but should be checked on an individual basis.

Instruct parents to feed the infant when she is hungry ( usually 8-12 times in 24 hours). Discuss with parents that iron\u00adfortified formula is the most important nutrition for the infant at this time. Other foods or drinks are not advised unless recommended by the health care professional. The usual amount of formula for a 4\u00admonth\u00adold in 24 hours is about 30 to 32 oz of formula per day, with a range of 26 to 36 oz. Sample Questions How is feeding going? What formula are you using now? Is the formula fortified with iron? Have you tried other formulas? How often does your baby feed? How much at a feeding? How much in 24 hours? How does your baby show she is hungry or full? Has your baby begun to put her hands around the bottle? Are you still holding your baby for feedings? What questions or concerns do you have about the formula, such as cost, preparation, and nutrient content? Have you offered your baby anything other than formula? Anticipatory Guidance XY our baby is now able to clearly show when she is hungry or full. It also is not unusual for her to want different amounts of formula at different times of the day. She may take more at a morning feeding than at a noon feeding. It is important to respond to your baby's behaviors for feeding to avoid underfeeding or overfeeding. Overfeeding can lead to spitting up. Holding your baby during feeding also helps you understand the meaning of her behaviors. This will help you meet her needs and reduce fussiness. It will even help with her learning as she watches you and listens to your voice. XIt is important to hold your baby for all bottle\u00adfeedings to reduce the risks of choking and to ensure that your baby gets enough of the formula. To reduce the risk of your baby developing tooth decay, do not prop the bottle. XIf you have concerns about the cost of formula now that your baby is drinking larger amounts, you may want to contact community resources, like WIC, that can provide formula for your baby. XNever heat a bottle in a microwave. If you wish to warm a bottle, a hot water bath is recommended.

Remind parents that their own safe driving behaviors (including using seat belts at all times and not driv\u00ad ing under the influence of alcohol or drugs) are important to the health of their children. Sample Questions Do you use a rear-facing car safety seat in the back seat every time the baby rides in a vehicle? Do you know when to change from an infant-only car safety seat to a convertible car safety seat? Anticipatory Guidance XThe back seat is the safest place for babies and children to ride. Babies are best protected in the event of a crash when they are in the back seat and in a rear \u00adfacing car safety seat. XNever place your baby's car safety seat in the front seat of a vehicle with a passenger air bag because air bags deploy with great force. When it hits a car safety seat, it causes serious injury or death. Keep your baby's car safety seat rear facing in the back seat of the vehicle until your baby is 2 years of age or until he reaches the highest weight or height allowed by his car safety seat's manufacturer. XWhen your baby outgrows the weight or height limit of a rear \u00adfacing-only seat, switch to a convertible seat used rear facing. Convertible seats can be used rear facing to higher weights and heights. XDo not start the engine until everyone is buckled in.

Have you discussed with your child care provider the importance of safe sleep and back to sleep and tummy time to play? Anticipatory Guidance XContinue to put your baby to sleep on his back to reduce the risk of sudden infant death, but, if he rolls in his sleep, it is not necessary to return him to his back. Relatives and child care providers should be reminded to follow the same practice. XTo reduce the risk of suffocation, do not put loose, soft bedding, such as blankets, quilts, sheepskins, comforters, pillows, and bumpers or soft toys, in the crib. XBe sure your baby's crib is safe both at home and at the babysitter's home. It is best to use a crib made after June 28, 2011, that meets the newest safety standard. If you must use an older crib, the slats should be no more than 23 8 inches (60 mm) apart. The mattress should be firm and fit snugly into the crib. Drop\u00adside cribs should not be used. XLower the crib mattress before the baby can sit up by himself. XIf you choose a mesh play yard or portable crib, consider choosing one that was manufactured after a new, stronger safety standard was implemented on February 28, 2013. If you use an older product, the weave should have openings less than \u00bc inch (6 mm) and the sides should always stay fully raised. Safe Home Environment As the baby develops more fine and gross motor skills and becomes more active, it is important to review with parents how to keep the home environment safe. This applies to all homes where the baby spends time, including child care and grandparents' and friends' homes. Sample Questions Where does your baby spend awake time during the day? Have you made any changes in your home to help keep your baby safe? Anticipatory Guidance XTo protect your child from tap water scalds, the hottest temperature at the faucet should be no more than 120\u00b0F. In many cases, you can adjust your water heater. XDrinking hot liquids, cooking, ironing, smoking cigarettes, or using e\u00adcigarettes while holding your baby puts him at risk of burns. XTo prevent choking, keep small objects, sibling's toys, pieces of plastic, and latex balloons out of the baby's reach as he develops skills with reaching. XAlways keep one hand on your baby when changing diapers or clothing on a changing table, couch, or bed, especially as he begins to roll over.

The major devel\u00adopmental markers of a 6\u00admonth\u00adold are social and emotional. A 6\u00admonth\u00adold likes and needs to interact with people. He increasingly engages in reciprocal and face\u00adto\u00adface play and often initiates these games. From these reciprocal interactions, he develops a sense of trust and self\u00adefficacy. His distress is less frequent than in previous weeks. The infant also is starting to distinguish between strangers and those with whom he wants to be sociable. He usually prefers interacting with famil\u00ad iar adults. At 6 to 8 months, he may appear to be afraid of new people. The 6\u00admonth\u00adold can sit with support, and he smiles or babbles with a loving adult. He may have a block, toy, or book in his hand. As he watches his hands, he can reach for objects, such as cubes, and grasp them with his fingers and thumbs. He can transfer objects between his hands and may attempt to obtain small objects by raking with all his fingers. He also may mouth, shake, bang, and drop toys or other objects. The infant's language has moved beyond making razzing noises to single\u00ad consonant vocalizing. The 6\u00admonth\u00adold produces long strings of vocalizations in play, usually during interactions with adults. He also can stand with help and enjoys bouncing up and down in the standing position. He may rock back and forth on his hands and knees, in preparation for crawling forward or backward. An infant who lies on his back, shows little interest in social interaction, avoids eye contact, and smiles and vocalizes infrequently is indicating either developmental problems or a lack of attention from his parents and other caregivers. He needs formal developmental assessment and referral to early intervention, as well as increased health supervi\u00ad sion, and he may need more nurturance. Over the next few months, as the infant develops an increasing repertoire of motor skills for mobil\u00ad ity, such as crawling and pulling to a stand, parents must be vigilant about falls. The expanding world of the infant must be looked at through his eyes to make exploration as safe as possible. The infant will do more than most parents anticipate, and sooner. Toys must be sturdy and have no small parts that could be swallowed or inhaled. Baby walkers should never be used at any age. To avoid possible injury, it is never too early to secure safety gates at the top and bottom of stairs and install window guards. Parents need to understand developmentally appropriate strategies to redirect their child's behavior when safety is threatened or inappro\u00ad priate behaviors occur.ContextInfancy 6 Month Visit BFG 4TH ED.indb 457 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents458 INFANCY FIRST WEEK VISIT (3 TO 5 DAYS)INFANCY 6 MONTH VISIT Priorities for the 6 Month Visit The first priority is to attend to the concerns of the parents.

Use of the questions may vary from visit to visit and from family to family. Questions can be modified to match the health care professional's commu\u00ad nication style. The accompanying anticipatory guidance for the family should be geared to questions, issues, or concerns for that particular infant and family. Tools and handouts to support anticipatory guidance can be found in the Bright Futures Tool and Resource Kit. Risks: Living Situation and Food Security Parents in difficult living situations or with limited means may have concerns about their ability to obtain affordable housing, food, or other resources. Provide information and referrals, as needed, for community resources that help with finding quality child care, accessing transportation, getting a car safety seat or an infant crib so that the baby can sleep safely, or addressing issues such as financial concerns, inadequate or unsafe housing, or limited food resources. Public health agencies can be excellent sources of help because they work with all types of community agencies and family needs. Sample Questions Tell me about your living situation. Do you live in an apartment or a house? Is permanent housing a worry for you? Do you have the things you need to take care of the baby, such as a crib, a car safety seat, and diapers? Does your home have enough heat, hot water, electricity, and working appliances? Do you have health insurance for yourself? How about for the baby? Within the past 12 months, were you ever worried whether your food would run out before you got money to buy more? Within the past 12 months, did the food you bought not last and you did not have money to get more? Have you ever tried to get help for these issues? What happened? What barriers did you face?

XPrograms and resources are available to help you and your baby. Y ou may be eligible for the WIC food and nutrition program, or housing or transportation assistance programs. Several food programs, such as the Commodity Supplemental Food Program and SNAP , the program formerly known as Food Stamps, can help you. If you are breastfeeding and eligible for WIC, you can get nutritious food for yourself and support from peer counselors. Risks: Tobacco, Alcohol, and Drugs The use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs has adverse health effects on the entire family. Focusing on the effect on health is often the most helpful approach and may help some family members with quitting or cutting back on substance use. Sample Questions Does anyone in your home smoke or use e-cigarettes? Are you worried about any family members and how much they smoke, drink, or use drugs? How often do you drink beer, wine, or liquor in your household? Do you, or does anyone you ride with, ever drive after having a drink? Does your partner use alcohol? What kind and for how long? Are you using marijuana, cocaine, pain pills, narcotics, or other controlled substances? Are you getting any help to cut down or stop your drug use? Anticipatory Guidance XIt's important to keep your car, home, and other places where your child spends time free of tobacco smoke and vapor from e\u00adcigarettes. Smoking affects your child by increasing the risk of asthma, ear infections, and respiratory infections. X800-QUIT-NOW (800-784-8669); TTY 800-332-8615 is a national telephone helpline that is routed to local resources. Additional resources are available at www.cdc.gov.

BFG 4TH ED.indb 465 1/20/17 2:47 PMBright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents466 INFANCY FIRST WEEK VISIT (3 TO 5 DAYS)INFANCY 6 MONTH VISITRisks: Parental Depression An estimated 10% to 20% of women struggle with major depression before, during, and after delivery of a baby. Fathers also may experience major depression in this period. A prior history of depression increases risk for both mothers and fathers. Parental depression has substantial personal consequences and inter \u00ad feres with quality of child\u00adrearing, adversely affecting parent\u00adinfant interactions, maternal responsiveness to infant vocalizations and gestures, and other stimulation essential for optimal child development. Sample Questions What are some of your best, and most difficult, times of day with the baby? How are you feeling emotionally? Have you been feeling sad, blue, or hopeless since the delivery? Are you still interested in activities you used to enjoy? Do you find that you are drinking alcohol, using herbs, or taking drugs to help make you feel less depressed, less anxious, less frustrated, and calmer? Who has been available to assist you at home? Who has been the most help to you? Anticipatory Guidance XMany mothers feel tired or overwhelmed with a new baby. These feelings should not continue, however. If you find that you are still feeling very tired or overwhelmed, or you are using over \u00adthe\u00adcounter or pre\u00ad scription medication, drugs, or alcohol to feel better, let your partner, your own health care professional, or me know so that you can get the help you need. Strengths and Protective Factors: Family Relationships and Support As the infant becomes increasingly awake and alert and demands attention, parents may find new challenges in balancing responsibilities with wanting to interact with a responsive and engaging infant. Mothers may find that family support systems that were available earlier are less available now. It is important to periodically review the family's living circumstances and familial relationships, and who is currently responsible for decision\u00admaking and caregiving to the child and family. Remind parents it is OK to ask for help and to be specific in expressing their needs to family and close friends. Sample Questions Who are you able to rely on to help you with the baby or when you are tired? How are you balancing your roles of partner and parent? How do you feel you are managing in meeting the needs of your family? Who are you able to go to when you need help with your family? Anticipatory Guidance XWhen you are feeling stressed or overwhelmed, you need to be able to use the support network that is available to help you. If you are having difficulty doing this or are hesitant to do so, we may be able to give you additional counseling and support. XIf your family is living with others, such as elders or those who are helping you from being homeless, or if you are a teen parent living with your parents, you may have little control over your environment and caregiver roles and responsibilities. If you are in this situation, you can talk to me about things you can do to reduce the stress and make the most of your circumstances.

Sample Questions What are your child care arrangements? Do you have a reliable person to care for your baby when you need or want to go out? Are you satisfied with the arrangements? How many hours is your child in child care each day? Anticipatory Guidance XIt is important that you have a child care provider whom you like and trust and who gives your baby a healthy and predictable daily routine that is similar to what you provide.

Parents need to understand the developmen\u00ad tal next steps that are likely to occur after each visit as well as their role as teachers and the importance of using appropriate behavioral management strategies appropriate for the child's developmental age. Infants learn about their environment through visual exploration, mouthing toys, and, eventually, imitation. Show parents examples of age\u00adappropriate books such as \"touch and feel\" and other soft plastic or board books that cannot be damaged by the infant's ripping or chewing. Sample Questions How do you think your baby is learning? Does he watch you as you walk around the room? Anticipatory Guidance XY our baby's vision gradually improves during the first year of life. By 6 months of age, he should be able to follow you around the room with his eyes. Putting your baby in a high chair or an upright seat during awake time (as opposed to a crib), will allow him to visually explore and verbally interact with you and his brothers and sisters. Communication and Early Literacy As the baby matures, parents will need to expand their strategies to support their child's neurobehavioral maturation, self\u00adregulation, and ability to tolerate specific sensory stimuli. Encourage parents to engage in interactive, reciprocal play with their infants, as this promotes emotional security as well as language development. This playtime should not be a teaching session, but rather a time to follow the infant's inter \u00ad ests and expand the play with simple words. Sample Questions What have you noticed about changes in your baby's development and behaviors around you and other people? How does your baby adapt to new situations, such as people or places? Is he sensitive to any particular stimulation? Does he seem to get anxious or easily upset? If yes: What things seem to trigger these reactions? How does your baby communicate or tell you what he wants and needs? With gestures? Does he point? What sounds is your baby making, such as \"ga, \" \"ma, \" \"ba\"?

Understanding your baby's temperament will help you respond to his needs and fussy behaviors appropriately. XBabies learn to communicate during typical daily routines, such as bedtime, naptime, baths, diaper changes, and dressing. Here are some things you can do to help your baby develop these communica\u00ad tion skills. -Talk with your baby during routine activities. -Play music and sing. -Imitate vocalizations. -Play games such as pat\u00ada\u00adcake, peekaboo, and \"so big. \" XPlace your baby in your lap and look at picture books together. Point to and name things in the book. Respond if he pats a picture or turns a page. XAnticipate short attention spans. Media As more families and children have access to and exposure to digital media, it is important to assess for the use of such devices and offer guidance regarding media in the home. Sample Questions How much time each day does your baby spend watching TV or playing on a tablet, smartphone, or other digital device? Is there a TV or other digital media device on in the background while your baby is in the room? Anticipatory Guidance XBabies may start to seem interested in mobile devices and TV at this age, but it is mostly because they are attracted to the lights and sounds, and because they are naturally interested in whatever their care\u00ad givers are paying attention to. XResearch shows that babies this age cannot learn information from screens, even though many toys and videos claim to teach babies skills. Babies learn by interacting with caregivers; being read, talked, and sung to; and exploring their environment by grabbing, mouthing, crawling, and cruising. Make special time for this tech\u00adfree type of play every day. XMost babies are starting to eat sitting in high chairs now. Make this an opportunity for face\u00adto\u00adface learning interactions. Don't have the TV or other digital media on during meals, which distracts babies from learning. XStarting healthy media habits now is important, because they are much harder to change when children are older.

Parents who cannot provide this type of environment for their infant may need additional counseling, monitoring, and intervention. Monitor infants who are excessively active or extremely quiet. Additional counseling and assistance for parents who are sad or unhappy, or who rarely sleep or sleep more than expected, is extremely important. Infants, especially those with special health care needs, such as premature infants or babies with chronic health or developmental conditions, who exhibit any stereotypical behaviors or sensory issues may need additional assistance. Parents who are excessively anxious, or, conversely, parents who are unaware of potential dangers, also need additional assistance. Sample Questions What is your baby's typical day like? When does he wake up, eat, play, nap, and go to sleep for the night? Anticipatory Guidance XAs much as possible, maintain a consistent and predictable daily routine for your baby. This will help him learn how to manage his own behavior appropriately now and as he gets older. Putting Self to Sleep By 6 months of age, some, but not all, babies are sleeping for longer stretches at night (6-8 hours), which parents consider \"through the night. \" Parents need to support their infant's increasing ability to put himself to sleep initially and put himself back to sleep after awakening at night. Suggestions about establishing a bedtime routine, putting the infant to bed when he is awake, and other habits to discourage night waking help parents help their baby learn to console himself. In many cultures, family sleep arrangements are viewed as a part of the parent's commitment to their children's well\u00adbeing. Infant sleep patterns are often among the last traditions to change among immigrant families. Sample Question How is your baby learning to go to sleep by himself? Anticipatory Guidance XPlacing your baby in the crib when he is drowsy, but not asleep, will help your baby learn that he can go to sleep on his own. Then, when he awakens at night, he will be more likely to be able to go back to sleep without your help. This approach will help both you and your baby get a good night's sleep.

Remind parents that the baby is not trying to make them angry\u2014he is just having a rough time and still needs someone to be there. Parents can ask a family member, neighbor, or trusted friend to stay with the crying baby for a few minutes to allow the parent to take a break. Review the importance of protecting an infant's head even though the baby has head control. Never shake or hit an infant, as even unintentional shaking or hitting may cause brain damage. Sample Questions How does your baby calm himself? How much does your baby cry? What helps to calm your baby? What do you do if that does not work? Do you ever feel that you or other caregivers may hurt the baby because of the crying? What will you do if you feel this way? Do you have a plan? How do you handle the feeling? Anticipatory Guidance XAt 6 months of age, your baby may still have fussy periods. If he is clean, dry, and not hungry, his fuss\u00ad iness may be telling you that he is tired or bored. Regular daily naps and giving him a variety of short play activities are 2 good strategies for dealing with overtiredness and boredom. XY ou can ask a family member, neighbor, or trusted friend to stay with your crying baby for a few min\u00ad utes to allow you to take a break. If you are alone, you can try putting the baby in his crib, closing the door, and checking on him every few minutes. XBy 6 months of age, your baby will have different strategies that will allow him to begin calming himself, such as grasping safe and appropriate toys, oral exploration, and visual exploration.

This includes parental awareness of the importance of their own dental health and modeling of brushing their teeth. The oral health risk assessment recommended by the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry is recommended to begin at 6 months of age. Sample Questions What have you thought about doing to protect your infant's teeth during this first year? What are your plans for protecting your baby's teeth? Where does your baby take her bottle? Do you continue to hold it for her? Anticipatory Guidance XAll infants need a source of fluoride at 6 months. If your water does not contain fluoride, it is time to begin fluoride supple mentation. Our local health department may be a resource for information about local community fluoride levels. XEarly dental care, with the eruption of the first tooth, means using a soft toothbrush or cloth to clean your baby's teeth with a small smear of fluoridated toothpaste, no more than a grain of rice, twice a day\u2014after the baby's first feeding in the morning and then after the last feeding before nighttime sleep. XContinue to hold your baby for bottle\u00adfeeding. Do not prop the bottle or let your baby graze, which means drinking from a bottle at will during the day. XPutting your baby to bed with a bottle or grazing with a bottle containing juice, milk, or other sugary liquid will lead to tooth decay. XAvoid baby foods or juices that babies suck out of a bag or pouch. A baby's teeth or gums will be in con\u00adtact with pureed food longer than necessary, leading to tooth decay. It's always best to use a spoon. XAvoid sharing a spoon or putting the pacifier in your mouth because this introduces your own bacteria into your baby's mouth, which can contribute to tooth decay.

This review also will determine the need for more in\u00addepth assessment of nutritional adequacy and anticipatory guidance about the use of nutritional supplements (eg, vitamins, herbs, alternative formulas, and foods). Infants who take longer than 35 to 45 minutes to feed should be evaluated carefully for developmental and nutritional concerns. Significant transitions in feeding occur during the next 3 months, and parents need clear guidance about what to expect. Managing this transition includes a discussion about cultural or extended family beliefs about introduction of solid foods and types and textures of foods. The concept of the division of responsi\u00ad bility between parent and infant with feeding is especially helpful. In this division, the parent is responsible for providing appropriate foods and the infant is responsible for how much to eat. Sample Questions What questions or concerns do you have about your baby's growth and feeding? What are you feeding your baby at this time? How often are you feeding your baby? How much does he eat or drink? When you begin feeding him solid foods, where will he sit when you feed him? Are you feeding your baby any drinks or foods besides breast milk or formula? About how long do feedings last? Anticipatory Guidance XIn the next 6 months, it is typical for your baby's growth to slow down a little, as you can see on the growth chart. XBreastfeeding exclusively for about 6 months of life and then combining breast milk with solid foods from about 6 to 12 months of age provides the best nutrition and supports the best possible growth and development. Y ou can continue breastfeeding for as long as you and your baby want. XFor infants who are not breastfed, iron\u00adfortified infant formula, with the addition of solid foods after 6 months of age, is the recommended alternative through the first year of life. XAs you begin solid foods, it is important to feed your baby in a bouncy seat or high chair that is adjusted to support your baby's head, trunk, and feet, so you can look at each other. Y our baby's arms also should be free, as this is his way of communicating with you. Of course, when offering the bottle, it is still very important to continue to hold your baby so that you can see each other and communicate with each other. Y our baby then will be able to let you know when he is still hungry and when he is full.

Remember, you are responsi\u00ad ble for providing a variety of nutritious foods, but he is responsible for deciding how much to eat. Solid Foods Parents need specific verbal or written guidance on the introduction of solid foods. The order in which they are introduced is not critical as long as essential nutrients are provided. For the breastfed infant, emphasize the need to include a good dietary source of iron to prevent iron deficiency and an oral vitamin D supplement (400 IU/day). Some breastfed infants may need an iron supplement. Parents can offer store\u00adbought and home\u00adprepared baby food as well as soft table foods. As the infant pro\u00ad gresses from purees to foods with more consistency, encourage parents to offer finger foods, such as soft bananas and cereal. Advise parents that infants do not need salt or sugar added to their food. After the introduction of solid foods, the next few months are a sensitive period for learning to chew. A gradual exposure to solid textures during this time may decrease the risk of feeding problems, such as rejecting certain textures, refusing to chew, or vomiting. The WIC can provide information and guidance on introducing solid foods. Sample Questions How are you planning to introduce solid foods, such as cereal, meats, fruits, vegetables, and other foods? How much does your baby eat at a time? How does your baby let you know when he likes a certain food? Does your baby have any favorite foods? Anticipatory Guidance XAdding solid foods to your baby's diet is very individualized. Transitioning from breast milk or formula at about 6 months of age to table foods at 12 months of age involves a number of steps. XA key step is to determine when your baby is ready for solid foods. -One of the signs that a baby is ready to eat solid foods is the fading of the baby's tongue\u00adthrust reflex. This is when the baby pushes food out of his mouth. -Another sign is that the baby can elevate his tongue to move pureed food to the back of his mouth and, as he sees a spoon approach, he opens his mouth in anticipation of the next bite. At this stage, your baby sits with arm support and has good head and neck control, so he can indicate a desire for food by opening his mouth and leaning forward. -He can tell you he's full or doesn't want food by leaning back and turning away. XIntroduce single\u00adingredient new foods, one at a time, and watch for adverse reactions over several days. XGood sources of zinc\u00ad and iron\u00adrich foods include zinc\u00ad and iron\u00adfortified infant cereal and pureed meats, especially red meats. One ounce (30 g) of infant cereal provides the daily iron requirement, particularly if you give it to him along with vitamin C-rich foods, such as fruit, which enhance iron absorption from the cereal. Some breastfed infants may need to continue oral iron drops.

Offer solid food 2 to 3 times per day and let him decide how much to eat. XAs with all feeding interactions, watch your baby's verbal and nonverbal cues and respond appropri\u00ad ately. If a food is rejected, move on and try it again later. Don't force him to eat or finish foods. XGive your baby an initial taste of one of these foods at home rather than at day care or a restaurant. Most reactions occur in response to what is believed to be the initial try. XRepeated exposure to foods enhances acceptance of new foods by both breastfed and formula\u00adfed infants. It may take up to 10 to 15 experiences before a new food is accepted, because of the transition to textures as well as tastes. XThe only foods to be avoided are raw honey or large chunks of food that could cause choking. Newer data suggest that the early introduction of all foods may actually prevent individual food allergies. XIf your baby has no apparent reaction, introduce the food in gradually increasing amounts. Continue introducing other new foods in the same manner if no adverse reactions occur. XGiving your baby foods of varying textures, such as pureed, blended, mashed, finely chopped, and soft lumps, will help him successfully go through the change from gumming to chewing foods. Slowly intro\u00ad ducing solid textures during this time may decrease the risk of feeding problems, refusing to chew, or vomiting. Gradually increase table foods. Avoid mixed textures, like broth with vegetables, because they are the most difficult for infants to eat. Pesticides in Vegetables and Fruits Many families wonder whether they should choose organic fruits and vegetables over conventional to reduce pesticides exposure in their child's diet. The key message is to encourage vegetable and fruit con\u00ad sumption\u2014eating a diet rich in a variety of fruits and vegetables, either conventional or organic, has well\u00adestablished health benefits. Choosing organic fruits and vegetables can reduce exposures to pesticides in the diet. Sample Question What fruits and vegetables does your child eat? Anticipatory Guidance XThe most important thing is to encourage your baby to eat a variety of vegetables and fruits. XWash vegetables and fruits before serving. XConsider buying organic, if possible.

Caution parents to limit juice to 2 to 4 oz of 100% juice in any one day and to avoid the use of sweetened drinks, such as sodas and artificially flavored \"fruit\" drinks that provide calories without other nutrients. Sample Question What types of fluids is your baby getting in the bottle or cup? Anticipatory Guidance XGive your baby only 2 to 4 oz of 100% juice in any one day, as it is not considered a snack or food. Avoid the use of sweetened drinks, such as sodas and artificially flavored fruit drinks that provide calories without other nutrients. Breastfeeding Guidance Congratulate the mother for continuing to breastfeed. Weaning ages vary considerably from child to child. Although breastfeeding is recommended for at least 12 months, or longer as mutually desired by the mother and infant, some infants are ready to wean earlier. Refer mothers to breastfeeding support groups or a lactation consultant as needed for questions or concerns. Vitamin D supplementation (400 IU per day) is recommended for all breastfed infants, but is not needed for formula\u00adfed infants, as vitamin D is present in the formula. Some preterm infants will require supple\u00ad mentation of additional vitamins. Oral iron supplementation (1 mg/kg/day) for exclusively breastfed infants should continue until iron\u00ad and zinc\u00adrich complementary foods (baby meats and iron\u00adfortified cereals) are introduced. It may take a month or two following the introduction of these foods for infants to consume sufficient iron from com\u00adplementary foods alone. Red meat is a better source of iron than iron\u00adfortified cereals for older infants because a higher percentage of the iron in red meat is absorbed. Sample Questions How is breastfeeding going? In what ways is breastfeeding different now from when you were last here? How often are you breastfeeding your baby? For how long on each breast? Are you continuing to provide vitamin D drops and iron drops? Does it seem like your baby is breastfeeding more often or for longer periods of time? How can you tell if he is satisfied at the breast? What are your plans for continuing to breastfeed?

Y ou should try to continue to breastfeed for the first year of your baby's life and for as long thereafter as you and your baby want to continue. XBe sure to continue your baby's vitamin D until your baby is taking at least 16 oz of vitamin D-fortified milk each day. XContinue your baby's iron supplement until he is eating red meat or iron\u00adfortified cereal every day. Formula-Feeding Guidance Older infants generally consume 24 to 32 oz of formula per day with solid food, but larger infants (6 months old, 90th percentile for weight) may take as much as 42 oz of formula per day without solid foods. Often, at this age, parents may consider using a less expensive formula and may need guidance based on the individual needs of the infant. Sample Questions How is formula feeding going? What formula are you using now? Have you tried other formulas or are you thinking of using other formulas? How often does your baby feed in 24 hours and how much does he take at a feeding? Day feeding versus night feedings? Do you have any concerns about the formula, such as cost, preparation, or nutrient content? Anticipatory Guidance XContinue to feed your baby when he shows hunger cues, usually 5 to 6 times in 24 hours. XSupplements are not needed if the formula is iron fortified and your baby is consuming an adequate vol \u00ad ume of formula for appropriate growth. XDuring the first year of life, babies continue to need iron\u00adfortified formula. If the cost of the formula is a concern, programs such as WIC or other community services may be able to help you. XNever heat a bottle in a microwave. If you wish to warm a bottle, a hot water bath is recommended.

These seats typically allow more room for the infant's legs and are designed to be used rear facing to higher weights and heights. Advise parents that their child should ride rear facing as long as possible, or at least to age 2 years. The rear \u00adfacing position offers the best possible protection to the infant's head, neck, and spine. Convertible and 3\u00adin\u00ad1 car safety seats have weight and height limits that will accommodate even large toddlers up to 24 months rear facing. Remind parents that their own safe driving behaviors (including using seat belts at all times, not driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and avoiding use of electronic devices while driving) are impor\u00ad tant to the health of their children. Sample Question How well does your baby fit in her rear-facing car safety seat? Anticipatory Guidance XThe back seat is the safest place for all babies and children to ride. XKeep your baby's car safety seat rear facing in the back seat of your vehicle until your baby is at least 2 years old. XNever place your baby's car safety seat in the front seat of a vehicle with a passenger air bag because air bags deploy with great force. When it hits a car safety seat, it causes serious injury or death. XBabies are best protected in the event of a crash when they are in the back seat and in a rear \u00ad facing car safety seat. They should be in a 5\u00adpoint harness at all times. XInfants who reach the maximum height or weight allowed by their rear \u00adfacing-only car safety seat should use a convertible or 3\u00adin\u00ad1 seat that is approved for use rear facing to higher weights and heights (up to 50 pounds and 49 inches, depending on the seat). Y our baby will be safest if she rides rear facing to the highest weight or height allowed by the manufacturer. XDo not start the engine until everyone is buckled in. XY our own safe driving behaviors are important to the health of your children. Use a seat belt at all times, do not drive after using alcohol or drugs, and do not text or use mobile devices when driving.

Information on con tinuing to keep the crib safe is important in providing reassurance. Sample Questions Do you continue to place your baby on her back for sleep? Where does she sleep? Anticipatory Guidance XContinue to put your baby to sleep on her back to reduce the risk of sudden infant death, but, if she rolls in her sleep, it is no longer necessary to return her to her back. Relatives and child care providers should be reminded to follow the same practice. Bed sharing increases the risk of sudden infant death. Y our baby should continue to sleep in her own crib, not in your bed. If you breastfeed or bottle\u00adfeed your baby in your bed, return her to her own crib before you go back to sleep. XBe sure your baby's crib is safe. It is best to use a crib made after June 28, 2011, that meets the newest safety standard. If you must use an older crib, the slats should be no more than 23 8 inches (60 mm) apart. The mattress should be firm and fit snugly into the crib, and drop sides should not be used. XThe crib mattress should be at its lowest point before the baby begins to stand. Keep bumpers, pillows, and other items out of the crib to prevent suffocation and so they cannot be used as steps over the crib railing to a fall. XIf you choose a mesh play yard or portable crib, consider choosing one that was manufactured after a new, stronger safety standard was implemented on February 28, 2013. If you use an older product, the weave should have openings less than \u00bc inch (6 mm) and the sides should always stay fully raised.

No home is ever childproof, but parents can initiate changes to make the environment safer. This applies to all homes where the baby spends time, including child care and grand\u00ad parents' and friends' homes. Sample Questions What other things are you doing to keep your baby safe and healthy? Do you spend time outside with your baby? Do you use a front or back carrier to carry her? Anticipatory Guidance XAs your baby begins to crawl, it is a good idea to do a safety check of your home and the home of family or friends. XBefore bathing your baby, test the water temperature on your wrist to make sure it is not too hot. To protect your child from tap water scalds, the hottest temperature at the faucet should be no more than 120\u00b0F. In many cases, you can adjust your water heater. Never set a cup of coffee or any hot liquid on a table that is within your child's reach. XDon't leave your baby alone, even for a second, in a tub of water, even if you use a bath seat. Never leave your baby alone on high places such as changing tables, beds, sofas, or chairs. XUse appropriate barriers around space heaters, wood stoves, and kerosene heaters. XBabies this age explore their environment by putting anything and everything into their mouths. NEVER leave small objects, electrical cords, or latex balloons within your baby's reach. XTo prevent choking, limit finger foods to soft bits not much larger than a Cheerio. Infants and children younger than 4 years should not eat hard food like nuts or popcorn, compressible foods like hot dogs or marshmallows, or sticky foods like spoonfuls of peanut butter. XBe sure to keep household products, such as cleaners, chemicals, and medicines, locked up and out of your child's sight and reach. If your child does eat something that could be poisonous, call the Poison Help line at 800-222-1222 immediately. Post the number next to every phone and store it in your cell phone. Do not make your child vomit. XThe kitchen is the most dangerous room for children. A safer place for your child while you are cook\u00ad ing, eating, or unable to provide your full attention is the play yard, crib, or stationary activity center, or buckled into a high chair. XY our baby may be able to crawl as early as 6 months of age. Use gates on stairways and close doors to keep her out of rooms where she might get hurt. XDo not use a baby walker. Y our baby may tip the walker over, fall out of it, or fall down the stairs and seriously injure her head. Baby walkers let children get to places where they can pull heavy objects or hot food on themselves. XBabies this age are not ready for formal swimming lessons. Although some programs claim to teach infants how to save themselves from drowning, there is no evidence that lessons for babies younger than 1 year reduce the risk of drowning. Such lessons may influence parents to be less vigilant around water, thinking that their baby can save herself from drowning, and are not recommended. XThe best sun protection is to avoid the sun. Y our baby's head and face are exposed in a front or back car \u00ad rier. Always have her wear a hat. Apply sunscreen with an SPF greater than 15 to any exposed skin. BFG 4TH ED.indb 480 1/20/17 2:47 PM481 INFANCY FIRST WEEK VISIT (3 TO 5 DAYS)INFANCY 1 MONTH VISITINFANCY 9 MONTH VISITThe 9\u00admonth\u00adold has made some striking devel\u00ad opmental gains and displays growing indepen\u00ad dence. She is increasingly mobile and will express explicit opinions about everything, from the foods she eats to her bedtime. These opinions often will take the form of protests. She will say, \"No, \" in her own way, from closing her mouth and shak\u00ading her head when a parent wants to feed her, to screaming when she finds herself alone. The baby also has gained a sense of object permanence (ie, she understands that an object or person, such as a parent, exists in spite of not being visible at the moment). The 9\u00admonth\u00adold's behaviors are an adaptation to her uncertainties about how the world works. Though certain that an unseen object exists, she is not yet fully confident that the out\u00adof\u00adsight object or the absent person will reappear. Her protests when a parent leaves show her attachment and her ability to fear loss. Her insecurity about the where\u00ad abouts of her parents may lead to night waking. Until this age, she was waking during her normal sleep cycle, but usually fell back to sleep. Many babies who were sleeping through the night revert to night waking. Knowing that this is a normal developmental stage may help parents accept the temporary return to earlier patterns. As a result of these developments, the parents' tasks have changed dramatically. The infant's increas\u00ading activity and protests necessitate setting limits. The parents must decide when it is important for them to say, \"No. \" This requires self\u00adesteem, con\u00ad fidence in their role as responsible parents, and a great deal of energy. Parents also view their infant's growing independence with a sense of loss. No longer content to be held, cuddled, and coddled, the baby will now wiggle, want to be put down, and may even crawl away. This physical independence requires a heightened vigilance about safety around the house. Recognizing and responding appropriately to infant cues associated with basic care, such as nurturing and feeding, now require complex skills. As the baby's first birthday approaches, the parents' attitudes and expectations, based in part on their own early childhood experiences, will become a significant factor. At the 9 Month Visit, it is important for the health care professional to assess the parents' attitudes and abilities to cope with their infant's growing independence of body and mind. The health care professional also should provide the parents with basic skills and resources for making decisions about methods of managing their infant's behavior. At 9 months of age, infants are at the height of stranger awareness. The intensity of their responses to strangers is highly variable. Although they may have been friendly and cooperative at the previous visit, they are far more likely to become upset with the physical examination at this age. The health care professional can minimize this reaction by approaching the infant very slowly, by examining the infant in a parent's arms, by first touching the infant's shoe or leg and gradually moving to the chest, and by distracting the infant with a toy or stethoscope during the examination.

Discuss the difference between discipline (which involves the parent teaching appropriate behaviors) and punish\u00ad ment (which places emphasis only on negative behaviors). Assist parents in making their baby's environment safe rather than trying to teach their baby how to be safe. Emphasize that yelling, spanking, and hitting are ineffective punishment in changing behaviors. Also point out that, at this age, an infant is NOT capable of learning or remember \u00ad ing rules. Priorities for the 9 Month Visit The first priority is to attend to the concerns of the parents. In addition, the Bright Futures Infancy Expert Panel has given priority to the following topics for discussion in this visit: XXSocial determinants of healtha (risks [intimate partner protective factors [family relationships and support]) XXInfant behavior and development (changing sleep pattern [sleep schedule], developmental mobility and cognitive development, interactive learning and communication, media) XXDiscipline (parent expectations of child's behavior) XXNutrition and feeding (self-feeding, mealtime routines, transition to solid foods [table food introduc-tion], cup drinking, plans for weaning) XXSafety (car safety seats, heatstroke prevention, firearm safety, safe home environment: burns, poison-ing, drowning, falls) a Social determinants of health is a new priority in the fourth edition of the Bright Futures Guidelines.

Use of the questions may vary from visit to visit and from family to family. Questions can be modified to match the health care professional's commu\u00ad nication style. The accompanying anticipatory guidance for the family should be geared to questions, issues, or concerns for that particular infant and family. Tools and handouts to support anticipatory guidance can be found in the Bright Futures Tool and Resource Kit. Risks: Intimate Partner Violence Children who are exposed to intimate partner violence are at increased risk of adverse mental and physical health outcomes. Intimate partner violence cannot be determined through observation, but is best iden\u00ad tified through direct inquiry. Avoid asking about abuse or domestic violence, but use descriptive terms, such as hit, kick, shove, choke, or threaten. Provide information about the effect of violence on children and about community resources that provide assistance. Recommend resources for parent education and/or parent support groups. To avoid causing upset to families by questioning about sensitive and private topics, such as family vio\u00ad lence, alcohol and drug use, and similar risks, it is recommended to begin screening about these topics with an introductory statement, such as, \"I ask all patients standard health questions to understand factors that may affect health of their child as well as their own health. \" Sample Questions Because violence is so common in so many people's lives, I've begun to ask about it. I don't know if this is a problem for you, but many children I see have parents who have been hurt by someone else. Some are too afraid or uncomfortable to bring it up, so I've started asking all my patients about it routinely. Do you always feel safe in your home? Has your partner, or another significant person in your life, ever hit, kicked, or shoved you, or physically hurt you or the baby? Are you scared that you or other caregivers may hurt the baby? How do you stay calm and centered when things are getting overwhelming? Do you have any questions about your safety at home? What will you do if you feel afraid? Do you have a plan?

XY ou can also call the toll\u00adfree National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-SAFE (7233). Strengths and Protective Factors: Family Relationships and Support The increasingly mobile infant brings joy to his parents with his new abilities to move around the home. Keeping him safe and entertained often leaves parents very little time for themselves. Discuss whether the parents have time to themselves, with each other, and with other family and friends. Social contacts and activities apart from the baby can help maintain parental well\u00adbeing. Ideally, both partners are involved in health supervision visits and infant care. Sample Questions Do you have regular time for yourself? How often do you see friends and get out of the house to do other activities? What do you do to take care of yourself? Anticipatory Guidance XAll parents need time alone and individual time with their partner. XStaying in touch with friends and family members and participating in activities without the baby helps avoid social isolation.

Sample Questions What changes have you noticed in your baby's sleeping habits? Does she wake up during the night? Anticipatory Guidance XThis is an age when sleep routines that help your baby gradually relax and get ready for sleep are espe\u00adcially important. The pre\u00adbedtime hour, before the routine begins, should be especially affectionate and nurturing. Disruptions in routine, such as vacations, visitors, or late evenings out, can significantly dis\u00ad turb sleep patterns. Try to avoid these disruptions if possible. XIf your baby is waking in the night, continue to just check on her and settle her back to sleep. This rou\u00adtine can help your baby put herself back to sleep. XAs your baby begins to stand, it is important to lower the mattress in her crib to the lowest level before she learns to stand up in it. Make sure you don't have bumper pads in the crib because she could use them as steps. Developmental Mobility and Cognitive Development The infant's increasing mobility and independence, but also her referencing and looking over to see that the parent is still there for protection, are important developmental steps. Parents need to understand their baby's temperament and how the family can adapt to it. If developmental or behavioral concerns exist, a referral to a local Early Intervention Program, often referred to as IDEA Part C, is appropriate to provide parents with education and counseling on strategies they may be able to implement during everyday rou\u00ad tines that will support their infant's continuing development.

XGive your baby opportunities to safely explore. Be there with her so that she can always check to see that you are nearby. XSometimes, it's easy to think that your baby can do more than she's really able to do. Be realistic about her abilities at this age and set realistic, nonthreatening, enforceable limits. XY our baby is eager to interact and play with other people as a way to develop interpersonal relationships. At the same time, at this age, she will show separation anxiety from you and other important caregivers. This anxiety is a sign of her strong attachment to you. XPay attention to the way your baby reacts and adapts to new situations and people. These reactions reflect her personality and temperament. To the extent possible, make these situations easy on your baby. For example, if she is a quiet baby who does not like a lot of noise and bustle, explain that to a per \u00ad son meeting her for the first time and ask the person to greet her in a calm and soothing way. Interactive Learning and Communication At this age, gestural communication, joint attention, and social referencing are being established. An infant who is not making good eye contact should be closely followed. Encourage parents to engage in interac\u00ad tive, reciprocal play with their infants, as this promotes emotional security as well as language develop\u00ad ment. This playtime should not be a teaching session, but rather a time to follow the infant's interests and expand the play with simple words. Parents are interested in learning about alternatives to screen time and media entertainment. Interactive entertainment, such as talking, reading, or playing games together or walking in the park, can be reinforced. Sample Questions How do you think your baby is learning? How is your baby communicating with you now? Anticipatory Guidance XY our baby's way of learning is changing from exploring with her eyes and putting things in her mouth to noticing cause and effect, imitating others, and understanding that objects she cannot see still exist. XHelp your baby develop these skills by playing with simple cause\u00adand\u00adeffect toys. Try balls that you can roll back and forth, toy cars and trucks that she can push, and blocks that can be put into a container and dumped out. Songs with clapping and gestures and songs with finger actions will help her learn imitation. Peekaboo and hide\u00adand\u00adseek are great ways to help her understand object permanence, that things and people exist even if she can't see them. It is important to stimulate your child to develop these capacities by interacting with her. XY our baby will now begin to use gestures, such as pointing, and vocalizations to let you know what she wants. She also will begin to show her preferences more clearly, such as refusing to eat certain foods by clearly turning away. It is important to respond to your baby's efforts to communicate with you by acknowledging her preferences, yet being consistent in your expectations. Using modeling, demonstra\u00ad tion, and simple descriptions of what behaviors you want from your baby will work much better than long sentences or a raised voice.

Discuss alternatives to infants watching TV . Discourage any TV , computer, tablet, smartphone, or viewing or play for infants and chil\u00ad dren younger than 18 months. Media use can interfere with the parental interaction with young children that is essential for vocabulary and language development. 9,10 Sample Questions How much time each day does your baby spend watching TV or playing on a tablet, smartphone, or other digital device? Is there a TV or other digital media device on in the background while your baby is in the room? Anticipatory Guidance XResearch shows that babies this age cannot learn information from screens, even though many toys and videos claim to teach babies skills. Babies learn by interacting with caregivers; being read, talked, and sung to; and exploring their environment by grabbing, mouthing, crawling, and cruising. Make special time for this tech\u00adfree type of play every day. XMost babies are starting to eat sitting in high chairs now. Make this an opportunity for face\u00adto\u00adface learning interactions. Don't have the TV on during meals, which distracts babies from learning. XStarting healthy media habits now is important, because they are much harder to change when children are older. XConsider making a family media use plan. A family media use plan is a set of rules about media use and screen time that are written down and agreed on by parents. Take into account not only the quantity but the quality and location of media use. Consider TVs, phones, tablets, and computers. Rules should be followed by parents as well as children. The AAP has information on how to make a plan at www.HealthyChildren.org/MediaUsePlan.

The more consistent parents are in establishing and reinforcing appropriate behavior, the easier it will be for the infant to learn what is, and is not, allowed. Providing parents with appropriate developmental expectations is an impor\u00adtant aspect of helping parents come to an agreement on their approaches to parenting. Sample Questions What are your thoughts about discipline? How do you and your partner manage your child's behavior? What are your strategies? Do you and other key family members, such as mothers, mothers-in-law, and other elders, agree on ways to manage the baby's environment to support healthy behavior? Have you discussed these issues with your child care provider? How are your other children adapting to the baby as he gets older? Anticipatory Guidance XAn important aspect of discipline is teaching your child what behaviors you expect. During the first year of life, the parents' primary role is to balance stimulating an infant's natural curiosity with pro\u00ad tecting him from harm. During this time, babies learn more by example from what they observe than through what their parents may say to them. Therefore, setting an example of the behaviors you expect of your child is very important. XUse positive language to describe the behavior that is desired, as often as possible. For example, say, \"Time to sit, \" rather than, \"Don't stand. \" This will give him better direction about the behavior that is desired. XA critical step in establishing discipline is to limit, \"No, \" to the most important issues. One way to do this is to remove other reasons to say, \"No, \" such as putting dangerous or tempting objects out of reach. Then, when an important issue comes up, such as your baby going toward the stove or radiator, saying, \"NO, hot, don't touch, \" and removing the baby will have real meaning for him. XBecause infants have a natural curiosity about objects they see their parents using, but also a short attention span, distraction and replacing a forbidden object with one that is permissible are excellent strategies for managing your baby's behavior in a positive way. XAnother aspect of discipline is consistency among parents, other family members, and child care pro\u00ad viders. It is important to discuss what behaviors are allowed and what behaviors are not allowed. Have this discussion with your partner, family members, and child care provider. Some simple rules for your child can be established, such as saying, \"Don't touch, \" for certain objects. XAsking siblings to help with the baby to the extent they are able will continue to meet their needs of being involved and feeling they are important members of the family.

As infants begin to want independence with self\u00adfeeding, it is increasingly important for parents to understand the division of responsibility between parent and child with regard to feeding\u2014the parent is responsible for providing a sufficient amount and variety of nutritious foods, and the child is responsible for deciding how much to eat. The time between the introduction of solid foods and age 9 months is a sensitive period for learning to chew. A gradual exposure to solid textures during this time may decrease the risk of feeding problems, such as rejecting certain textures, refusing to chew, or vomiting. Sample Questions How has feeding been going? What is your baby feeding herself? What does your baby eat with her fingers? Has she used a cup? Has your baby received breast milk or other fluids from a bottle or cup? Anticipatory Guidance XTry to be patient and understanding as your baby tries new foods and learns to feed herself. Removing distractions, like TV , will help her stay focused on eating. Remember, it may take 10 to 15 tries before your baby will accept a new food. XAs your baby becomes more independent in feeding herself, remember that you are responsible for pro\u00ad viding a variety of sufficient nutritious foods, but she is responsible for deciding how much to eat. XMost 9\u00admonth\u00adolds can be on the same eating schedule as the family. This usually means breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The baby also should have a mid\u00admorning, afternoon, and bedtime snack. The amount of food taken at a single feeding may vary and may not be a large amount, but the 3 meals and 2 to 3 snacks help ensure that your baby is exposed to a variety of foods and receives adequate nutrition. Snacks can be an opportunity to try new foods. XGiving your baby foods of varying textures, including pureed, blended, mashed, finely chopped, and soft lumps, will help her successfully go through the change from gumming to chewing foods. Slowly introducing solid textures during this time may decrease the risk of feeding problems, refusing to chew, or vomiting. Gradually increase table foods. Avoid mixed textures, like broth with vegetables, because they are the most difficult for infants to eat.

One hundred percent juice may be served as part of a snack, but should be limited to 4 oz per day. Avoid the use of sweetened drinks, such as sodas and artificially flavored \"fruit\" drinks. These drinks provide calories, but no nutrients. XNo foods need to be withheld except raw honey and chunks that could cause choking. Plans for Weaning The transition from a complete milk diet to a diet of solids and milk continues. Discuss plans for weaning or transitioning from formula to whole milk and from breast or bottle to cup. For babies receiving formula or human milk from a bottle, weaning can be done gradually, substituting 1 bottle with a cup of the liquid. As the infant approaches 12 months of age, most, if not all, bottles can be eliminated. Because breastfeeding is recommended for the entire first year, weaning is usually delayed to after 12 months. However, some mothers report that their babies appear to be less interested in breastfeeding at around age 9 months. This is often remedied by breastfeeding in a quiet environment free of distraction. Alternatively, pumped human milk or infant formula (NOT cow's milk) may be served from a cup, not a bottle. Sample Questions What are your plans for continuing to breastfeed? What questions or concerns do you have? Anticipatory Guidance XWeaning ages vary considerably from child to child. Some are ready to wean earlier than others and will show this by decreasing their interest in breastfeeding as they increase their interest in the foods they see their parents eating. XY our baby's best source of nutrition at 9 months of age continues to be breast milk with solid food. Try to continue breastfeeding through the first year of the baby's life, or for as long as both you and your baby want. XIf your baby is taking formula, it is recommended that it be your baby's major milk source until her first birthday. Whole milk can be introduced after age 1 year. XAs you begin to wean your baby, consider starting with the least interesting bottle time (perhaps the naptime bottle). Gradually substitute the cup for other bottles. XIf your baby is used to being held during feeding, hold her while feeding with a cup.

Remind parents that the rear\u00adfacing position offers the best protection for the baby's head, neck, and spine. Death and serious injury are significantly less likely for infants and young children who are rear facing compared with for \u00ad ward facing. Children should ride rear facing to the highest weight or height allowed for rear facing by the manufacturer of their convertible or 3\u00adin\u00ad1 seat, until at least age 2 years. These seats have height and weight limits that can accommodate even large toddlers rear facing through the second year of life. Advise parents that it is not dangerous for their baby's feet to touch the vehicle seat back. Lower extremity injuries are extremely rare among rear \u00adfacing children in crashes, but are common in forward\u00adfacing children, and toddlers are typically quite comfortable with their legs folded or propped up on the seat back. Remind parents that their own safe driving behaviors (including using seat belts at all times, not driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and avoiding use of electronic devices while driving) are impor\u00ad tant to the health of their children. Sample Questions Is your baby fastened securely in the back seat in a rear-facing car safety seat for every ride in a vehicle? Do all members in the family use a seat belt every time they ride in a vehicle? Anticipatory Guidance XNever place your baby's car safety seat in the front seat of a vehicle with a passenger air bag because air bags deploy with great force. When it hits a car safety seat, it causes serious injury or death. XBabies are best protected in the event of a crash when they are in the back seat and in a rear \u00ad facing car safety seat. They should be in a 5\u00adpoint harness at all times. XKeep your baby's car safety seat rear facing in the back seat of the vehicle until your baby is at least 2 years old. It is preferable to wait even longer, until the baby reaches the highest weight or height allowed by the manufacturer of the rear \u00adfacing seat. XChildren who reach the maximum height or weight allowed by their rear \u00adfacing-only car safety seat should use a convertible or 3\u00adin\u00ad1 seat that is approved for use rear facing to higher weights and heights (up to 50 pounds and 49 inches, depending on the seat). Y our baby will be safest if he rides rear facing to the highest weight or height allowed by the manufacturer.

Click on \"Find a Tech. \" Toll-free Auto Safety Hotline: 888-327-4236 Heatstroke Prevention Each year, an average of 37 children die of heatstroke after being left in cars that become too hot. More than half of the deaths are infants and children younger than 2 years. In most cases, the parent or care\u00ad giver forgot the child was in the car, often because there was a change in the usual routine or schedule. Additionally, some children have died while playing in the vehicle or after getting in the vehicle without the caregiver's knowledge. Even very loving and attentive parents can forget a child in the car. The temperature inside a car can rise to a dangerous level quickly, even when the temperature outside is as low as 60 degrees. Leaving the windows open will not prevent heatstroke. Because children have propor \u00ad tionally less surface area than adults and less ability to regulate internal temperature, their bodies overheat up to 5 times more quickly than adults' bodies. Sample Question Every year, children die of heatstroke after being left in a hot car. Would you like to talk about creating a plan so this doesn't happen to you? Anticipatory Guidance XNever leave your baby alone in a car for any reason, even briefly. XStart developing habits that will help prevent you from ever forgetting your baby in the car. Consider putting an item that you need, like your purse, cell phone, or employee ID, in the back seat of the vehicle, so you will see your baby when you retrieve the item before leaving the car. XCheck the back seat before walking away, every time you park your vehicle.

The AAP recommends that firearms be removed from the places where children live and play. Parents who own firearms may be more receptive to this discussion when firearms are considered along with the other household hazards than when they are the sole focus of a dis\u00ad cussion. Children cannot reliably be taught not to handle a firearm. Therefore, if the household where the child resides has a firearm, it is essential that firearms are kept out of the sight and reach of the child. Sample Questions Does anyone in your home have a firearm? If so, is the firearm unloaded and locked up? Is the ammunition stored and locked separately from the firearm? Have you considered not owning a firearm because of the danger to your child and other family members? Anticipatory Guidance XHomicide and suicide are more common in homes that have firearms. As your baby becomes more active, the potential dangers of a firearm become even greater. The best way to keep your baby safe from injury or death from firearms is to never have a firearm in the home. XIf it is necessary to keep a firearm in your home or if the homes of people you visit have firearms, they should be stored unloaded and locked, with the ammunition locked separately from the firearm. XA young child's curiosity will always outweigh any lessons about not touching a firearm, so it is essential that you keep firearms far out of the sight and reach of your baby. Safe Home Environment: Burns, Poisoning, Drowning, Falls As their baby develops more fine and gross motor skills, it is important to review with the parents how to keep the home environment safe. No home is ever childproof, but parents can initiate changes to make the environment safer. This applies to all homes where the baby spends time, including child care and grand\u00ad parents' and friends' homes. Sample Question Now that your baby can move on his own more, what changes have you made in your home to ensure his safety? Anticipatory Guidance XDo not leave heavy objects or containers of hot liquids on tables with tablecloths. Y our baby may pull on the tablecloth. Turn handles of pans or dishes so they do not hang over the edge of a stove or table. XUse appropriate barriers around space heaters, wood stoves, and kerosene heaters. XKeep electrical cords out of your baby's reach. Mouth burns can result from chewing on the end of a live extension cord or on a poorly insulated wire. XTo prevent poisoning, keep household products, such as cleaners, chemicals, and medicines, locked up and out of your baby's sight and reach. Make sure your baby does not have access to paint chips or chewable surfaces in a home built before 1978 because they may contain lead\u00adbased paint. Keep the number of the Poison Help line (800-222-1222) posted next to every telephone and saved in your cell phone.

A safer place for your baby while you are cook\u00ad ing, eating, or unable to provide your full attention is the play yard, crib, or stationary activity center, or buckled into a high chair. XWatch your baby constantly whenever he is near water. He can drown in even a few inches of water, including in the bathtub, play pools, buckets, or toilets. A supervising adult should be within an arm's reach, providing \"touch supervision, \" whenever babies are in or around water. XDo not let young brothers or sisters watch over your infant in the bathtub, house, yard, or playground. XEmpty buckets, tubs, or small pools immediately after you use them. XTo prevent your baby from falling out of a window, keep furniture away from windows and install oper \u00ad able window guards on second\u00ad and higher \u00adstory windows. Use gates at the top and bottom of stairs. XUse safety straps to secure bookshelves, dressers, floor lamps, and other tall furniture as well as TVs to the wall. As your baby learns to stand and climb, he could pull the furniture down on himself and be crushed. Even heavy furniture can tip over if not secured to the wall. References 1.
