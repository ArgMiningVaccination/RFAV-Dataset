Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.501 (c)(3)-1 (a)(1) of the regulations states that in order to be exempt as an organization described in Section 501 ( c)(3) of the Code, an organization must be both organized and operated exclusively for one or more of the purposes specified in such section. If an organization fails to meet either the organizational test or the operational test, it is not exempt. Treas. Reg.\u00a7 1.501(c) (3)-1(d)(1)(ii) of the regulations provides that an exempt organization must serve a public rather than a private interest. The organization must demonstrate that it is not organized or operated to benefit private interests such as \"designated individuals, the creator or his family, shareholders of the organization, or persons controlled, directly or indirectly, by such private interests.\" Thus, if an organization is operated to benefit private interests rather than for public purposes, or is operated so that there is prohibited inurement of earnings to the benefit of private shareholders or individuals, it may not retain its exempt status. IRC \u00a7 6001 provides that every person liable for any tax imposed by the IRC, or for the collection thereof, shall keep adequate records as the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate may from time to time prescribe. Treas. Reg.\u00a7 1.6001-1(c) states that in addition to such permanent books and records as are required by paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the tax imposed by section 511 on unrelated business income of certain exempt organizations, every organization exempt from tax under section 501 (a) shall keep such permanent books of account or records, including inventories, as are sufficient to show specifically the items of gross income, receipts and disbursements. Such organizations shall also keep such books and records as are required to substantiate the information required by section 6033. See section 6033 and \u00a7\u00a71.6033-1 through -3. Treas. Reg.\u00a7 1.6001-1(e) states that the books or records required by this section shall be kept at all times available for inspection by authorized Internal Revenue Service officers or employees, and shall be retained as long as the contents thereof may be material in the administration of any Internal Revenue law. IRC \u00a7 6033(a)(1) provides, except as provided in IRC \u00a7 6033(a)(2), every organization exempt from tax under\u00a7 501 (a) shall file an annual return, stating specifically the items of gross income, receipts and disbursements, and such other information for the purposes of carrying out the internal revenue laws. The Secretary may also prescribe by forms or regulations the requirement of every organization to keep such records, render under oath such statements, make such other returns, and comply with such rules and regulations as the Secretary may from time to time prescribe. Treas. Reg.\u00a7 1.6033-1(h)(2) provides that every organization that has established its right to exemption from tax, whether or not it is required to file an annual return of information, shall submit such additional information as may be required by the District Director for the purpose of enabling him to inquire further into its exempt status and to administer the provisions of subchapter F (section 501 and the following), chapter 1 of the Code and IRC \u00a7 6033.

Rul. 59-95, 1959-1 C.B. 627 held that \"failure or inability to file the required information return or otherwise to comply with the provision of \u00a76033 of the Code and the regulations which implement it, may result in the termination of the exempt status of an organization previously held exempt, on the grounds that the organization has not established that it is observing the conditions required for the continuation of an exempt status. Revenue Procedure 2012-9, superseding Rev. Proc. 90-27, 1990-1 C.B. 514, Section 4.01, that the Internal Revenue Service will recognize the tax-exempt status of an organization only if its application and supporting documents establish that it meets the particular requirements of the section under which exemption from federal income tax is claimed. Section 4.02 states that a determination letter or ruling on exempt status is issued based solely upon the facts and representations contained in the administrative record. It further states: (1) The applicant is responsible for the accuracy of any factual representations contained in the application. (2) Any oral representation of additional facts or modification of facts as represented or alleged in the application must be reduced to writing over the signature of an officer or director of the taxpayer under a penalty of perjury statement. (3) The failure to disclose a material fact or misrepresentation of a material fact on the application may adversely affect the reliance that would otherwise be obtained through issuance by the Service of a favorable determination letter or ruling. In PLR 20113041, the IRS revoked the tax exemption of a public charity based on excess benefit and private inurement issues. The charity's records demonstrated that the President \"consistently utilized\" the charity's income for private purposes. The President routinely made \"loans to officers,\" but never fully substantiated the purpose of these loans. Since the charity had no Conflict of Interest Policy, the President who made these loans in the first place, then approved these \"loans\" with his wife and father. All of these amounts went into a \"Loans to Officers\" account and inadequate records were kept on how this money was spent to further the charity's exempt purposes. The IRS noted that the charity's inurement issues and excess benefit transactions \"resulted from the organization being under the control of one\u00ad person with a family-based governing board.\" Moreover, the IRS noted that because of the charity's structure, \"sufficient safeguards had not been put in place to prevent future violations .... \" In United States v. Wells Fargo Bank, 485 U.S. 351, 108 S. Ct. 1179, 99 LEd. 2d 368 (1900), the Supreme Court held that an organization must prove unambiguously that it qualifies for a tax exemption. In Better Business Bureau of Washington, D. C., Inc. v. United States, 326 U.S. 179 (1945), the Supreme Court held that the presence of a single non-exempt purpose, if substantial in nature, will destroy a claim for exemption regardless of the number or importance of truly exempt purposes. In Bubbling Well Church of Universal Love, Inc. v. Commissioner, 74 T.C. 531 (1980), in an action for declaratory judgment pursuant to Section 7428(a), the Tax Court considered an adverse ruling by the IRS Form 886-A (1-1994) Catalog Number 20810W Page__jQ publish.no.irs.gov Department of Revenue Service Schedule number or exhibit Form 886-A (Rev.

The applicant had declined to furnish some information, and made answers to other inquiries that were vague and uninformative. On the basis of the record, the Court held that the applicant had not shown that no part of its net earnings inures to the benefit of the family or that petitioner was not operated for private benefit. In Western Catholic Church v. Commissioner, 73 T.C. 196 (1980), the petitioner's only activities were some individual counseling and distribution of a few grants to needy individuals. The petitioner's failure to keep adequate records and its manner of operation made it impossible to trace the money completely, but the court found it clear that money passed back and forth between petitioner and its director and his for-profit businesses. The Court Held that petitioner had not shown it was operated exclusively for exempt purposes or the no part of its earnings inured to the benefit of its officer. In New Dynamics Foundation v. United States, 70 Fed. Cl. 782 (2006), the petitioner brought to challenge the denial of its application for exempt status. The court found that the administrative record supported the Service's denial on the basis that the organization operated for the private benefit of its founder, who had a history of promoting dubious schemes. The organization's petition claimed that the founder had resigned and it had changed. However, there was little evidence of change other than replacement of the founder with an acquaintance who had no apparent qualifications. The court resolved these questions against the petitioner, who had the burden of establishing it was qualified for exemption. If the petitioner had evidence that contradicted these findings, it should have submitted it as part of the administrative process. \"It is well\u00ad accepted that, in initial qualification cases such as this, gaps in the administrative record are resolved against the applicant\". TAXPAYER'S POSITION: The taxpayer's position is that the organization still serves its charitable purpose by providing health, education and treatment, including therapy, to the general public. GOVERNMENT'S POSITION: Based on the examination, the does not qualify for exemption as a charitable organization as described in IRC \u00a7501(c)(3) and Treas. Reg. \u00a71.501(c)(3) which provides that \"An organization must be organized exclusively for charitable purposes; it must be operated exclusively for charitable purposes; no part of the net earnings of which may inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual; it may not conduct more than an insubstantial amount of lobbying activities; and, it may not intervene in a political campaign.\" An organization is not operated exclusively for one or more exempt purposes if its net earnings inure in whole or in part to the benefit of private shareholders or individuals. and used the net earnings from the . , for their personal benefit. received a royalty from the organization for the use of his material. received wages as well as additional compensation from the organization.
