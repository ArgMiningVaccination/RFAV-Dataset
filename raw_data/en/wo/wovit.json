The following pages are about the effects of these mRNA vaccines on the etheric, astral bodies, etc. as reported by supersensible healers, many associated with the Anthroposophical movement. VLA Comment: I am glad I read this. Steiner also goes into the effects of psychotropic drugs Chemotherapy drugs, cyanide, morphine, etc on the AFTERLIFE experience...whoa! EXCERPTS: This book deals with the question of how corona inoculations can affect the super-sensible members of the human being and the afterlife. These questions will be examined on the basis of empirical supersensory perceptions. How can the spiritual world be grasped with the modern powers of consciousness and thinking? This was a question of the philosophers and writers of German Idealism: Joahann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Schlegel, Novalis, Friedrich Schiller and Johan Wolfgang von Goethe. In continuation of this spiritual inquiry, the Goethean researcher Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) became a pioneer of modern supersensible investigation. His 354 books with writings and lectures contain infinite depths. He attempted to create a broad foundation for the science of the spiritual world on which humanity can to further build. It is not about a \"harmless jab\", but about a powerful impulse to initiate a change in the human body, so that it is damaged in its basic evolutionary function as the vehicle for the soul-spiritual being of Man. This impulse can also block human being's existence after death. "}
