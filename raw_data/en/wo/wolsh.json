The basis of Homotoxicology is the function of the extra cellular matrix, or ECM, which works in the same way as the humours of Eastern medicine; as a regulatory mechanism. The science that Homotoxicology is based on builds on the old understanding of the humoral theory and seeks to find a definition for it in modern scientific research. In this unit you will learn about the science behind homeopathy (the minimum dose, the Law of Similars, dynamisation of the substance), toxins (unnatural chemical toxins, exogenous and endogenous sources of toxins, emotional and energetic toxins, the importance of liver detoxification and eliminations), the basics of [homotoxicology ](https://www.schoolofhealth.com/be-better/natural-health-definitions/homotoxicology/)(the Extra Cellular Matrix or Ground Substance of Alfred Pischinger), Regulatory Systems and Feedback Systems, Bioregulatory Medicine, Three Pillars of Homotoxicology, Greater Defence System, Acidosis, Bystander Reaction, the 6 Phase Table or Disease Evolution Table and Scientific laws, the Extra Cellular Matrix and Ground Regulation System of Pischinger (components, functions and regulatory responses of the ECM, deposition of toxins in the ECM, inflammation), bioregulatory medicine, the three pillars of homotoxicology (drainage and detoxification, cell and organ support, immunomodulation), greater defence system (the Reticuloendothelial system, the HPA axis, the Neural Reflex System, detoxification by the liver, detoxification of the Matrix, the Mucous Membranes), acidosis, Immune Bystander Reaction theory, the 6-Phase Table or Disease Evolution Table (excretion/humoral phase, reaction/inflammation phase, deposition phase, impregnation phase, degeneration phase and dedifferentiation/neoplasm phase) and using simple homotoxicology remedies in practice (preparations and remedies used in homotoxicology Hans Heinrich Reckeweg (1905-1985) who was a doctor, naturopath and homeopath and whose aim was to 'marry' together all of these disciplines. The result was Homotoxicology, the study of toxins and how they affect the human organism. With its roots in naturopathy, the basis of [Homotoxicology ](https://www.schoolofhealth.com/be-better/natural-health-definitions/homotoxicology/)is that the body is trying to maintain homeostasis via the elimination of toxicity. All routes of elimination therefore need to be supported. Homotoxicology and Bioregulatory medicine has been put forward as a medicine of the future. Homotoxicology Course Units: 1 Study Hours: 100 Credits: 10 Time: Estimated 2 months (timing up to you) Enrolment period: 4 months (with option to extend) Books: Purchased separately Certification: Certificate in Homotoxicology Study Options: [E-learning](https://www.schoolofhealth.com/courses/study-options/) (online) or [Correspondence](https://www.schoolofhealth.com/courses/study-options/) (paper) Aims of the course - To have a basic understanding of Homotoxicology - To compare Eastern medicine, Naturopathic and Homeopathic understanding and to bring this up to date with modern research, which verifies these traditional medical approaches - To build on Naturopathic and Homeopathic understanding by viewing these two disciplines from a scientific perspective - To learn about the importance of the extra cellular matrix and its regulatory effect upon health and disease - To understand the connections between the extra cellular matrix and the humoural theory of Eastern medicine - To understand the importance of inflammation, drainage and the progression of disease - To learn simple Homotoxicology prescribing Why study Homotoxicology? Homotoxicology is a blend of Homeopathy, Naturopathy and modern scientific research. It therefore brings these disciplines 'up to date' by studying the science that underlies them and how they work. Study of [Homotoxicology ](https://www.schoolofhealth.com/be-better/natural-health-definitions/homotoxicology/)offers the student an in-depth scientific understanding of disease, which encompasses the humoral foundation of Eastern medicine, Homeopathy and Naturopathy. Students will build on their understanding of the regulatory processes in the body and how toxicity will hinder these processes, resulting in pathology. This module brings together everything that has been learnt so far in the course and views it from a modern scientific perspective, whilst at the same time maintaining the underlying naturopathic foundation.
