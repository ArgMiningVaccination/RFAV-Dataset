Jeffrey Immelt P'10, chairman and chief executive officer of General Electric Company (GE), will deliver the Commencement address to the Class of 2010 on Sunday, May 23. Immelt has had a tumultuous, but successful stint at GE thus far. His first years were difficult - he took com - mand four days before the 9/11 terrorist attack in 2001, and he led GE through the recession at the turn of the century and the Enron collapse (when the public became increasingly skeptical of CEOs of large corporations). Immelt has now been CEO at GE for over eight years, and financial magazine Barron' s has named him one of the \"World's Best CEOs\" three times. He also serves on the board of the New Y ork Federal Reserve Bank. Four individuals, including Immelt, will receive honorary degrees at the Commencement ceremony. Peter Gelb, general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, who is in charge of its current revitalization through high- definition television and satellite radio, Dr. Martin Hirsch '60, professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School and a top national physician in the HIV/AIDS fight and Christie Vilsack K'72, executive director of the Iowa Initiative, a program which aims to lower unintended pregnancies in the state and eventually nationwide. Vil - sack's husband, current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack '72, also received an honorary degree in 2001. The Committee on Honorary Degrees searches and ultimately chooses the honorary degree recipients and Commencement speaker every year. \"The process to identify the speaker is a fairly fluid one and begins approximately two years in advance of every Commencement,\" said Meredith Harper Bon - ham, chief of staff and secretary to the board of trustees. \"The committee considers approximately fifty honorary degree candidates before winnowing the list down to a small group of individuals that take into consideration their qualifications, connections to Hamilton, potential availability, and breadth of backgrounds.\" Chaired by Susan Skerritt K'77, the 18-person com - mittee comprised of students, faculty and trustees. Ma - nique Talaia-Murray '12, Keith Willner '11 and Caitlyn Williams '11 are the student representatives. Geoscience professor David Bailey, Art professor Katharine Kuharic and English professor Margaret Thickstun are the pro - fessors on the Committee. The Commencement ceremony on Sunday, May 23, will begin at 10:30 a.m. in the Margaret Bundy Scott Field House. General Electric CEO Jeffrey ImmeltPHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY ANDY RICHARDSON '10PHOTO BY MEGAN BRAATEN '11 Hamilton Adopts Need-Blind Admission Policy by Emily Gerston '11 News writer For the first time in Hamilton's history, applicants to the College will be selected on an entirely need-blind basis. The Board of Trustees voted to enact the new policy at a meeting on March 6. \"Hamilton has always been a school of opportunity,\" said Monica Inzer, dean of admission and finan - cial aid. \"This policy is an extension of that. The goal was not need-blind, the goal was access. It's about stu - dents who work hard and deserve to be here.\" Need-blind admission means that an applicant's financial situation will not factor into an admission decision, and thus decisions will be based solely on merit. Fewer than 50 schools in the country are need-blind while still covering 100 percent of students' demonstrated financial need. \"This is a good thing,\" said Me - gan Young '13. \"The best students get to go to Hamilton regardless of what their financial status is.\" The Board of Trustees listed need- blind admission as a priority in the Strategic Plan published in January 2009, but it was described as a \"long- term goal.\" \"We were presenting this idea as a fundraising campaign, not for this year,\" said Inzer. Instead, the immedi - ate goal listed was a reaffirmation of Hamilton's commitment to meeting 100 percent of demonstrated financial need. According to Inzer, it was unclear until recently just how close Hamilton was to being need-blind. \"In 2007, we didn't know how much it would cost,\" she said. The Admission Office began an experiment to track how financial need entered their admissions deci - sions by disregarding financial need until the very last step in the admis - sion process. \"We'd say, 'Here's the class', and say it's the best class we can admit, and then pull the curtain back and look at financial need,\" said Inzer. \"When we ran out of financial aid, we ran out of admissions for those needing financial aid. We said, 'This is crazy, we're not admitting kids we want!'\" For the Class of 2012, 7 percent of the domestic student applicant pool was admitted with consideration of financial need. For the Class of 2013, this percentage dropped to 3 percent. Inzer attributed the ability to cover more financial need in large part due to Hamilton's elimination of merit scholarships in 2007. She said that as students who received merit scholar - ships graduate with each class, more money becomes available in financial aid each year to students with finan - cial need. Two years into Hamilton's admis - sion experiment, the Financial Aid Office determined that it would cost about $500,000 dollars per year to ad - mit a class on a need-blind basis. \"It wasn't until we did the experiment... that I realized we actually are see Need-Blind, page 3The College will continue to meet 100 percent of demonstrated financial need.

Chadd Hippensteel '10 is working in cooperation with the Gilded Bike Program to create a bicycle program on cam - pus modeled after ones that exist at UC Irvine and in various American and European cities. He discussed how the Gilded Bike Program on campus is both costly and disorganized, with accountability being a large issue. Students who ride the bikes down the hill never seem to bring them back up, and bikes are often misplaced or stolen. Hippensteel suggested a pro - gram similar to Zipcar, where bikes are checked out through the swipe of a Hill Card. Bikes would be given GPS trackers so that they would never remain lost for long. Students could use the bikes while rushing to class or to tour the surrounding farmland or Root Glen. There is the possibility of eventually adding electric bikes to help students who must come up Col - lege Hill Road. Each year, many cars and bikes are brought to campus that add clutter; Hippensteel believes his plan would cut down on this clutter and make the bikes more accessible to all. Pre-Law Guidance Concerns The Student Affairs Committee focused largely on the Career Center's issues and progress throughout the past year. Trustees expressed concern that the pre-professional programs, in particular pre-law, are not as helpful as they could be, espe - cially in preparing students for the LSAT. It was agreed that targeting sophomores would be helpful so that students would begin to think about future careers early, rather than second semester of senior year. Budget Notes on Construction, Financial Aid The Buildings and Grounds Committee ran through the various costs of construction that will occur over the sum - mer, including $1.4 million to remove the asbestos in Bundy Residence Hall and $1.3 million for replacing the Field House floor. The Budget and Finance Committee also discussed costs, including the financial impact of going need-blind and plans to increase the endowment so that Hamilton's operating bud - get can also increase. They also mentioned an error that has occurred in the budget - an increase that occurred two years ago in the student activity fee was accidentally not passed on to Student Assembly's student activity budget.Author Margaret Atwood Talks Characters and Canadian Pride by Kerry Q. Coughlin '11 News writer She may have been the Win - ton Tolles Lecturer, but some considered Margaret Atwood the \"Great Names\" substitute. Professor of English Naomi Guttman introduced the Canadi - an novelist and poet as \"one of the greatest living writers,\" and on Thursday, March 4, the Ham - ilton community was introduced to her sense of humor, thoughts on writing, political views and more. \"I thought I would talk to - night on questions I have been asked before besides 'Where do you get your ideas?' and 'How do I get published?'\" began At - wood. Still, she spoke on her own writing process and her classification of her writing as speculative fiction. Atwood indicated she feels a connection to the characters in her work. Addressing the ques - tion, \"Why are there so many cans of sardines in your books?\" Atwood answered that some authors may go through a book never feeding their characters, but that she is not one of those people. She said, \"Nothing fancy or anything... just enough to keep them alive.\" Atwood also said that she makes sure to give her charac - ters a bath once in a while - it gives them some time to medi - tate, some \"downtime from the plot to think things through.\" In terms of her genre, At - wood explained to the audience why her writing was speculative fiction and not science fiction, saying that speculative fiction is On March 15, two Hamil - ton students were awarded the Thomas J. Watson Fellowship, a grant for college graduates to spend a year of independent study outside of the United States. Kevin Rowe '10 and Max Wall '10 are among only 40 students selected nation-wide to receive the stipend this year. Rowe's study project, enti - tled \"Farm to Table: New World Cities and the Changing Land - scapes of Cuisine,\" will involve traveling across the globe; he plans to research in Cyprus, India, China, Nicaragua, and Chile. He will focus on all of the steps in creating a cuisine for distinctive cultures. Rowe described the mis - sion in his own words, \"I will follow this food chain for one traditional dish in each of five cities, learning how new tech - nology and systems are alter - ing the ways we eat and ways we live together in and around cities.\" Wall, president and founder of Hamilton's LAFBAF fer - mentation club, will be pursu - ing his passion for fermentation into Ghana, India, and France. He plans to study traditional techniques of fermentation in each of the countries and how it relates to the cultural identity in each community he visits. Wall described how he first learned of the fellowship two years ago when a past win - ner told him about her experi - ence tracking Himalayan snow leopards. Since then, Wall said, gaining acceptance from the Watson Foundation became a \"mystical objective\" for him. \"I still can't believe that it's actually going to happen,\" he said.Seniors Rowe and Wall Win Watson Fellowships by Dan Steinman '12 News writer based on things that people are really able to do with the tech - nology we have or are working on. Though the self-deprecation of Canadians was a theme of the talk, Atwood also showed a sense of pride in her country and its literature. When asked what it is like to try to fashion a national liter - ature when American and Brit - ish literature are so dominant in Canada, she answered that Ca - nadian literature has, in recent years, gained a high readership and a high international profile. She published a book about Ca - nadian literature in 1972, which she compared to a book on ve - nereal disease, for it presented \"what kinds there are, where you might get some...\" Despite her dry sense of humor and frequent jokes, At - wood's talk had a very serious tone to it as well. What especially came through were her environ - mental views of the future, also a theme in many of her books. She emphasized hopeful action, cit - ing the race between green tech - nology and a disastrous collapse. In regards to hope, Atwood said, \"Hope is built in, like the arts themselves, an evolved ad - aptation that gives those who have it an edge.\" \"We need to have hope,\" Atwood said, \"For after all, where would we be if the early people did not have enough optimism to go out and hunt the mammoths?\" A native of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, Margaret Atwood is an internationally acclaimed author. She has written thirteen novels, the most recent of which is The Year of the Flood , in addition to a number of poetry collections, anthologies, children's books, non-fiction, short story collec - tions and more. Atwood has also won more than 55 awards both in Canada and internationally. PHOTO BY ANDY RICHARDSON '10 Margaret Atwood speaks in the Chapel on March 4.

This organization, devoted to raising environmental awareness, is an official partner of the United Nations Environment Program 's Billion Tree Campaign. Middlebury students are currently participating in the PlantMyPhone Campus Challenge, an effort to fund one million planted trees by 2011. To participate, students recycle their old cell phones. For each recycled cell phone, the student is informed of how many trees were planted from the phone's proceeds. It is estimated that an average of 15 trees can be planted for each recycled phone. Students can obtain postage-paid mailing bags for their old cell phones on campus or can print out free shipping labels on the program's website: www.plantmyphone.com.

Connecticut College On March 20, Olympic medalist and alumna of Con - necticut College, Anita DeFrantz '74, was inducted into the National Rowing Hall of Fame. DeFrantz began her rowing career as a member of Connecticut College's rowing squad. Since then, she has gone on to receive a bronze medal at the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games and was a four-time finalist and winner of a silver medal at the World Rowing Champion - ships in 1978. Additionally, she has won six National Cham - pionships. In 1984, DeFrantz was awarded the Connecticut College Medal, the College's most prestigious honor. In 1986, she was the first African American woman appointed to serve on the International Olympic Committee. Tufts University On March 31 at the Northeast Energy Efficiency Summit in Boston, Massachusetts, Northeast Energy Efficiency Part - nerships (NEEP) will recognize Tufts University as a \"Com - mercial/Business Leader for Energy Efficiency. \" Tufts was nominated by National Grid for its persistence in advancing energy efficiency, which has saved the University more than $600,000 over the past several years. In 2003, Tufts ' Presi- dent Lawrence Bacow confirmed Tufts' devotion to reducing carbon emissions by setting a new goal for the University to reduce emissions to 10 percent of 1990 levels by 2020. Sue Coakley, executive director of NEEP, remarked, \" Tufts provides an excellent example of how energy efficient mea - sures can improve a company's bottom line, contribute to economic growth and reduce environmental impact.\" During the 2010 summit, Tufts' efforts to further energy efficiency will be acknowledged along with 12 other Northeast Energy Efficiency Business Leaders.Admission Policy Now Need-Blind, Comprehensive Fee Up to $51,760 pretty close and we can do this,\" Inzer said. \"It's not ridiculous, it's responsible.\" The findings of the admis - sion and financial aid experiment were presented to the Board of Trustees at their December 2009 meeting. \"He [Chairman of the Board of Trustees A.G. Lafley] said, 'You only need $500,000 to go need-blind for the next class? And then he gave $500,000, and then the five other [members of the Board of] Trustees gave $500,000.\" Although the idea was first discussed in December, it was not given the official go- ahead until the Board of Trustees met this March. College President Joan Hinde Stewart has long advo - cated for need-blind admission. Stewart said in an article on the Hamilton website that she was the first person in her family to go to college and required the assistance of financial aid, and thus the new policy is person - ally significant to her. Inzer said, \"This couldn't have happened without a president who's really committed to financial aid. This is personal to her. Certainly it is to me, but I'm just the Dean of Admissions!\" This year, the Board of Trustees also voted at their March meeting to increase fi -nancial aid by $1.7 million, ac - cording to Chief of Staff and Sec - retary of the Board of Trustees Meredith Bonham. The Board also approved a 3.8 percent tu - ition and fee increase to $51,760 for the 2010-11 school year, ap - proved tenure appointments, and met with Posse program students and representatives from the se - nior class. \"They really love to connect with students as much as possible,\" said Bonham. Inzer gave the Board of Trustees credit for bringing the policy about so quickly. \"They believe in this place, they put the money where their mouth is,\" she said. \"They sparked a campaign for $40 million dol - lars,\" referring to the endowment the school is forming to ensure that the need-blind policy can be sustained. Each class will cost an esti - mated $2 million over the course of four years at Hamilton to re - main need-blind ($500,000 per year). These costs can quickly stack up, but an endowment dedicated to need-blind admis - sion will help ensure that Hamil - ton is able to remain need-blind in the long run. Hamilton will continue to meet 100 percent of demonstrated financial need for students through scholarships, loans, and work-study, as it has in past years. \"We're still going to pack -age people the same way we always did,\" said Inzer. \"Our financial aid policies will remain the same. What's different is the students we admit. We're go - ing to admit the most deserving candidates regardless of ability to pay.\" Matthew Farrington '12 called the new policy \"long overdue.\" He said, \"When I was looking at colleges, one thing I didn't like about Hamilton is that it wasn't need-blind, and I did notice.\" Betsy Bilharz '12 agreed, and said, \"I think it's something that should always have been in place.\" Admission of international and transfer students will not be entirely need-blind. However, roughly ten percent of Hamil - ton's financial aid budget goes to international students. Inzer indicated that she will attempt to consider transfer students on a need-blind basis, but \"I just can't guarantee it.\" The economic crisis of the past few years may have actu - ally helped Hamilton's move to need-blind admission rather than hurt it. \"Trimming our resources helped us focus on what's most important. It really helped us fo - cus on what our priorities were for this college,\" Inzer said. \"Where are you going to spend your next dollar? Well, mine goes to financial aid.\"from Need-Blind, page 1 Public Speaking Competition Features Speeches on Gay Marriage, Facebook by Dan Steinman '12 News writer Competition was strong at Hamilton's annual Public Speaking competition this year. On March 6, five students won prizes for their prepared speeches. Amanda Bowman '10 was awarded the Warren E. Wright Prize for her informa - tive speech on a current public issue, the legalization of gay marriage. Her speech was titled \"Iowa: The Gay Mecca?\" Bowman, an Iowan, de - scribed her motivation to give such a speech, \"Many people I talked to were surprised to find that Iowa had legalized same- sex marriage back in April 2009.\" \"My speech told the story of how the case went through the court systems and was unan - imously approved by the Iowa Supreme Court,\" Bowman ex - plained. \"I also talked about the reaction from the people of my state and what the legislature of Iowa is doing about it today.\" Bowman commented that she was \"extremely impressed\" by the other finalists in the Wright competition. The War - ren E. Wright Prize comes with a $5,500 award. Trang Nguyen '13, Xiao - han Du '12, Ian Doran '11, and Yan Kit Pang '10 were all win - ners of the McKinney Prize, awarded to the student from each class year that presented the most persuasive argument on a topic of social relevance to the Hamilton community. Pang was awarded $900, and all the other class winners were awarded $450. Du was very enthusiastic when reflecting on her expe - rience. She expressed appre - ciation for the opportunity to present her own ideas to fac - ulty members and trustees. Her speech was titled, \"A Call for the Revival of Humanism in Liberal Arts Education: When the Diversity of Ideas Meets the Idea of Diversity.\" The speech focused on the idea that the emphasis in creating a diverse student body is misplaced. \"It seems like the diver - sity [currently emphasized by educational institutions like Hamilton] is only skin deep,\" Du explained. She believes that, in an educational setting, \"Intellectual diversity in the classroom is more important PHOTOS BY KYLE RAJANIEMI '12 From left to right: winners Yan Kit Pang '10, Ian Doran '11 and Xiaohan Du '12. than diversity of race, gender, or sexual orientation.\" She presented that a revival of Humanist studies was the best way to return to universality in education. Pang also won the Clark Prize for his speech on the per - vasiveness and excessive use of Facebook. The Clark Prize, which has a $1,200 award, is the only prize with a specific topic. This year's topic was \"Facebook: How much infor - mation is too much?\"EDITORIAL 4 April 1, 2010 The Spectator is a publication of the Hamilton College Media Board.

Hamilton's new need-blind admission policy has thrown the College into the national spotlight. With this decision, Hamilton joins the very small rank of schools able to distin - guish themselves as need-blind while still maintaining their commitment to provide finan - cial aid for 100% of demonstrated need. Although the College has pledged to disregard financial need when admitting future students, Hamilton's admissions and financial aid policies will be not be undergoing a major overhaul. Hamilton has demonstrated its com - mitment to making a high quality education accessible for many years, as exemplified in 2007 when the College ceased offering merit scholarships in order to redirect the funds to need-based aid. We are proud to attend an institution that has committed itself so strongly to these ideals for so many years. The College's latest move to need-blind admissions was made possible by the guidance and leadership of our dedicated trustees. Although the College has made a number of bud - get cuts due to the current economic downturn, Hamilton has fared relatively well through the recession. The responsible management of the endowment helped position Hamilton to achieve the need-blind goal and the recent donations of generous trustees have made the new policy possible without sacrificing a commitment to Hamilton' s current students. All this being said, community members still seem unclear about the effects of a need- blind policy. Although we are proud to attend a school committed to providing access to the most qualified students, we cannot help but question the long term impact of this decision, which will require a $40 million endowment to support it. A financial commitment of this size in this economy naturally brings risks and with those risks, fears of an uncertain future. This uncertainty looms larger considering that in recent years, several colleges embarked on similar missions, only to rescind their commitments when they could no longer support the financial burden. We admire the College's new commitment to prospective students and recognize it as an important statement of our values as a community. However, we must ensure that this statement does not compromise other commitments to Hamilton's future. We can only hope for generous giving and responsible management in the coming years to ensure the success of this and other endowment campaigns.Need Blind, Self AwareOPINION 5 April 1, 2010 I have always had a very positive recollection of those years when Hamilton had Janu - ary term. Imagine this: setting off immediately in very early January with about 15 students to spend the month trekking around Israel studying ancient archaeological sites. Israel is a small country, about the size of the state of Ver - mont, and in that month we were able to see most of the major points of archaeological interest from Dan to Beersheba. Much of the time we lived in old Jerusalem, in a hospice. The Dome of the Rock became a daily sight as did the Via Do - lorosa. We returned often to the Mount of Olives and all those other places connected with the Hebrew Scriptures and the life of Jesus. We visited also ancient Jericho, one of the oldest cities in the world, as well as Masada and Qumran, Bethlehem and Hebron, even Beersheva and Arad. A northern trip took us to Tel Dan on the Lebanese border and to the many points in between. It was a trip none of us could ever forget. After being there, one can never read the Bible or listen to the news the same way again. I know that some faculty members were less enthusiastic about the month. There were some pedestrian courses that failed to excite anyone. And, I must say, returning to the campus on a Fri - day late in January exhausted from the month, only to begin teaching the spring semester the next Mon - day was something of a challenge. Nevertheless, I would not trade the January term experience for anything. Perhaps not everyone can of - fer such an exciting experience. Where, after all, does a mathema - tician need to go? It may be that J-term is not for everyone. I do think, however, that we ought to explore the possibility of offering credit for month-long concentrat - ed courses either on campus or away in some more exotic place. There are different ways of learn - ing and teaching and J-term pro - vides the opportunity to get out of our ordinary routine and explore very different avenues of learning. J-term means a month dedi - cated completely to one topic, theme or problem. It means both close faculty-student collabora - tion and considerable indepen - dence. It does take imagination and a great deal of work to put a good J-term course together, but in the end it is really worth it. A good J-term course, in fact, can transform the whole educational experience for both students and faculty. It has transformed many a so-so student, anxious just to graduate, into an excited, avid searcher. It has also transformed a few ho-hum professors too. I think we should give it a try. WWW.HAMILTON.EDU The Hamilton campus is hardly devoid of beauty. The natural land - scape, architecture and interior designs are aesthetically pleasing. Around this time just last year, I remember having received the last of various letters that read \"Congratula - tions! You're awesome!\" or \"Sorry, but you weren't good enough,\" from the col - leges to which I had applied. Not long after came the flood of questions from curious neighbors, relatives, friends, teachers and that random person who you never met but somehow knows your name. So, where are you going next year? In my case, there was always a follow-up question. Oh, so where is Hamilton exactly? I've never heard of it. Did I dare tell them that Hamilton is only a highly selective prestigious in - stitution nestled on the beautiful hilltop of Clinton, New York? Surely, I am not the only one on campus who has had to explain the whereabouts of Hamil - ton College and maybe even prove its existence. Hamilton College is simply one of the most overlooked campuses, es - pecially regarding its beauty. In fact, Scott Carlson just recently wrote an article, citing Hamilton in his list of the \"Most (Overlooked) Beautiful Cam - puses,\" on Chronicle.com, the website of the Chronicle of Higher Education. He wrote his article in response to a list of \"The World's Most Beautiful Col - lege Campuses\" published by Forbes magazine. Perhaps it would be fair to say that Hamilton has difficulty compet - ing in the worldwide beauty pageant of college campuses. However, it should arguably have a much better chance stateside. The colleges that often make the top of the beauty list are the most well known, such as Princeton, Stanford, Wellesley and many colleges in Cali -fornia. Sure, the Ivy League schools have their charm. They have majestic historical buildings, but Hamilton, too, has old buildings with a kind of classical beauty. Maybe the schools in Califor - nia have a one-up in the eyes of some judges, which is understandable. The majority of people don't exactly enjoy being pelted alternately by all sorts of precipitation and would prefer warm, sunny weather. However, that is not to say that Hamilton is not gorgeous when the snow blankets the campus and trans - forms it into a stunningly calming haven. The Princeton Review even lists Colgate University as one of its most beautiful. Yes, they did rob us of Tony Blair, and they may be our eternal rivals, but in terms of appearance, what does Colgate have that we don't? A swan lake? Beauty appears in all forms, so who is to judge which campuses are more beautiful than others? What characteristics do the so- called expert judges, who are sometimes architects and designers, use to grade the attractiveness of campuses? Furthermore, why is Hamilton so overlooked as a college? Some of my peers have complained about the relative nothingness that surrounds the campus. Hamilton's proximity to Utica might actually grant us negative points in the judges' books, if they have in fact heard of us. The next closest urban area would be Syracuse, but even that is nothing compared to a city like Philadelphia. A larger urban area naturally has more traffic and allows for more social con - tact, which would explain why more people have heard of Swarthmore Col - lege, right outside of Philadelphia, than have heard of Hamilton. The fact that Hamilton is such a small campus adds to the issue. One might say that we haven't had enough famous people to graduate from Hamilton. If only Obama or Lady Gaga had graduated from Hamilton. But one could theorize that a smaller campus decreases the number of graduates to indirectly or directly spread the word about Hamilton. It also decreases the chances of competing against larger schools. For example, only sometimes do some of Hamilton's extracurricular clubs compete in bridge tournaments or Model UN with larger schools that get more press, such as University of Pennsylvania. Perhaps the day will come when Hamilton's name will finally grace the top of the list of most beauti - ful schools. However, for the moment, Hamilton will be the most beautiful, unintentionally best-kept secret. Hamilton Overshadowed by Schools of Equivalent Beauty, Academic Caliber by Grace Minkyung Lee '13 opiNioN writer by Jay G. Williams '54 wAlCott bArtlett professor of religioNProfessor Praises January Term When Republican Scott Brown was elected in January by the state of Massachusetts to the United States Senate, pundits hailed the upset as the beginning of the end for the Democrat mandate in Washington. Their claims had some weight. After sweeping vic - tories for Democrats in the 2008 elections, a Republican coming from traditionally blue Massa - chusetts to fill the seat held for over 46 years by the late Senator Ted Kennedy suggested that the political preference of the nation might indeed be shifting; a pen - dulum swinging back in favor of a more Republican-driven agenda. Political discussions around the country shifted in the follow - ing weeks to fixate on the notion that Democrats would soon find themselves out of power as the 2010 midterm elections would no longer be a question of if, but rather to what extent Democrats would lose seats in Congress. Coupled with President Obama's declining approval rating it began to seem as though the only direction for the Republican Party was up. Fast-forward two months: seemingly uninhibited by any signs of a turning political tide, President Obama and the majori - ties in both houses of Congress used their political power to pass and sign into law major Health - care Reform legislation without a single Republican vote. The significance of this act should not be overlooked. It appears to be a simple exercise of a major - ity vote, but this bill, which has deeply polarized the two parties in Washington, is a bold statement of Democrat policy-making, not just in the scope to which it will affect nearly everyone in the country but in its context. The Democrats pushed their legislation through by William Rusche '13 opiNioN writerDemocrats May Suffer Backlash by Passing Recent Health Care Bill see Democrats, page 5OPINION 6 April 1, 2010 from Democrats, page 5 Congress without any support from the opposition party and in addition, without the support of the majority of the American People. A Rasmussen Report conducted two days after Obama signed the bill into law cites a 55% majority of the nation's population against the efforts of the Democrats. The question is whether or not Democrats have overplayed their hand. With so many people in opposition, Democrat representa - tives have already been subjected to racial epithets, death threats, and bricks thrown through windows. Republican leadership has repeat - edly condemned these actions but there are also other prominent party members who have perpetu - ated the notion that forcible, even violent retribution is acceptable. Sarah Palin, for example, recently posted a message on her Facebook page accusing Democrats of hav - ing \"disregarded the will of the people\" accompanied by a map of Democrats considered vulner - able in the upcoming elections on which the selected districts were literally targeted with the images of crosshairs. Her specific actions may be deemed insignificant in the long run; however, they serve to highlight the nature of one of the monsters that has emerged from the healthcare debate. Eager to channel the public opposition to healthcare, many on the right have been making efforts to turn anti- healthcare sentiments into anti- democrat sentiments. Figures like Palin and house minority leader John Boehner have done little to discuss how Republicans did ev - erything within their powers to stop healthcare reform from hap - pening, but made very little effort to find middle ground or make compromises on the bills. How can you claim that your voice has been disregarded when you don't make an effort to add your voice to the conversation? Furthermore, looking to his - tory, it is interesting to note a some - what similar legislative battle to healthcare that took place in the 1950s and 60s when Civil Rights was the major issue. Then, Demo - cratic president Lyndon Johnson spearheaded a unified majority of congress (along regional lines rather than party lines) to pass and sign a bill, overcoming widespread opposition from a huge part of the country's population. Then, as may happen now, the Democrats suffered politically. The attempts to legally end discrimination and segregation cost the Democrats widespread support in southern states, something that still contin - ues today. However, despite the self inflicted wound, Democrats helped the nation take an indisput - ably positive step forward, adding credibility to the notions that public opinion can be wrong at times and political retribution does not nec - essarily constitute wrongdoing. The Democrats of the 111th Congress will be subject to the same judgments by passing health - care reform without public sup - port. They have taken a large leap of faith on their policies and along the way have deserved a decent amount of criticism. If you can condemn the party now, then cast your votes accordingly. However, I would urge a temporary evalua - tion period. The Democrats may have overplayed their hand, but they might have also just pulled off the largest step forward for our country since civil rights.Democrats May Have Overplayed HandCartoon by James Grebey '12 stAff CArtooNist Millions of young adults lent their support to Barack Obama's historic presidential campaign. While young Americans' strong preference for Obama over John McCain was important in the general election, it was their early support that resulted in Obama's win in the Iowa caucuses and kick- started his meteoric campaign. An interesting question to pose now is whether Obama's history of youth support has resulted in a pro-youth track record of presidential actions. On the plus side, the recently- passed health care bill ensures that young adults can get insurance through their parent's policies until they turn 26. This is impor - tant since many of the jobs young people can get are those least likely to offer employer-provided health insurance coverage, something which is crucial to the many young Americans who fall seriously ill each year or already suffer from a pre-existing condition that makes them uninsurable. Besides this modification, many college students also benefit from the health care bill because it includes legislation changing the federal student-loan program. The measure cuts what many critics argue is a wasteful program, the Federal Family Education Loan program, which involves govern - ment guarantees of loans provided by private lenders. This excision should save the government about $61 billion, of which $36 billion is going to increase funding for the Federal Pell Grant program, means-tested assistance for mostly undergraduate students that does not have to be repaid like a loan. On the other hand, President Obama has maintained a heavy U.S. military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. Though I'm not cer - tain these decisions are mistakes, I do know that the casualties of war come primarily at the expense of our generation (not to mention the fiscal cost of the continuing conflict). Perhaps most glaringly, Presi - dent Obama has not made any serious attempt to control the un - sustainable levels of government spending and debt. But shockingly, he did create a bipartisan commis - sion to analyze these issues, but it won't release its report until after the November elections. Wonder why? Could it be that its sugges - tions might be politically unpalat - able? Nah.... Note that Obama has at times expressed the opinion that he doubts changes will be made by the federal government and legisla - ture on their own initiative, but will require some precipitous event to force their hand. Hardly an inspir - ing sentiment. Even before Obama's presi - dency began, it was clear to anyone with half a brain that eventually government expenditures would have to be cut and taxes would have to be increased, two burdens that would be largely born by our gen - eration. While these are pressing economic times, Obama's actions make it hard to show that he is truly concerned enough to finally force Congress to make hard decisions. Instead the Congressional Bud - get Office estimates that Obama's proposed budget for 2010 will add $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit, and his budget in 2011 will add another $1.3 trillion. And while I grudgingly sup - port it, the recent health care bill in itself is unlikely to reduce the deficit. The bill hopes to save money through spending cuts and tax increases that seem politically unlikely to ever actually be im - plemented, while the cost-saving changes actually implemented are mostly operating on a wish and a prayer since they have so little hard evidence to support their efficacy. It makes me feel all warm inside when I imagine the tax bills and pillaging of important government programs that lie in our generation's future. Alas I fear I am too hard on Obama. It's not his fault that our system is structured to slow and even prevent necessary change, or that Congress for the last few decades has been filled by mangy packs of spineless cretins. But Obama needs to keep the interests of young Americans in mind, since we look to and actually are the fu - ture of the United States. Plus, we can prove to be fickle voters and supporters.

The con - vention was held at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square. For three days, the participants at - tended any of the 200 workshops and listened to insightful com - ments made by the conference keynote speakers (such as Mark Halperin, whose book \"Game Change\" is number one on The New York Times Best Seller List). by Nick Stagliano '11 feAtures CoNtributor \"I learned about Kirkland because of Hamilton,\" says Susan Skerritt '77. Growing up Roch - ester, N.Y ., several of Skerritt's parents' friends were Hamilton alumni who told her about Ham - ilton and about Kirkland - then a brand new women's college. Skerritt's first experience at Kirkland was \"an amazing, clas - sic Kirkland interview,\" which described being charac - teristic itself: open, wide-ranging and - alistic. \"People were really en - couraged to be themselves and to figure out who they are. It was clear just starting from the interview what an unusual place Kirkland was.\" While at Kirkland, Skerritt took half of her classes at Ham - ilton - and she majored in eco - nomics, which was a Hamilton program. \"One of the things that I loved about being here was the diversity of experiences that you could have,\" Skerritt said of her time on the Hill when both insti - tutions were very much alive. Skerritt was involved in, among other things, extracur -ricular theater while at Kirkland. When she had the lead role in Anything Goes, opening week - end was performed in the hockey rink because the group putting on the show only had access to Minor Theater for the second weekend of their run. \"To put on a musi - cal in the hockey rink...let's just say that the acoustics were not great.\" When she graduated with a degree in economics, Skerritt considered jobs in several pos - sible areas of business and settled on banking, partially because it was based in New York and that seemed like the right place for her. \"I took a different path from many Hamilton alumni. I have al - ways been in the mid- and back- office parts of banking. I started my career in an operations train - ing program, then did technology work, then did strategic planning and sales, then left banking and did consulting, then went into investment banking and worked at Morgan Stanley, then went back into consulting and now I'm back at a bank - the Bank of New York Mellon [where Skerritt is Executive Vice President of the Financial Markets and Treasury Services Sector].\" \"Kirkland and Hamilton gave me the capacity to do a variety of different things in my career. My ability to handle multifaceted problems, to think broadly and to quickly adapt to new situations are a direct result of my experience on the Hill. Kirkland and Hamilton taught me how to learn and instilled in me an invaluable intellectual curiosity.\" Skerritt has been involved with Hamilton for a number of years, first as a member and then as president of the Alumni Council, and she has been on the Board of Trustees since 1995. Yet, \"Initially, it was very difficult to be involved after graduation,\" though Skerritt got involved with Hamilton much sooner than most Kirkland alumnae. \"The announcement about the merger [of Kirkland and Hamilton] was made three weeks before my graduation. And it was stunning to get that news right before you're leaving a place. Those last few weeks were ex - tremely difficult.\" In the year between Skerritt's graduation and 1978, when the merger was effected, there was a lot of work to see whether or not something else could be done. \"Certainly Kirkland women - as well as, interestingly, Hamilton alumni - were interested in hav - ing Kirkland continue - for differ - ent reasons. Kirkland women and alumnae wanted their school to remain; Hamilton alumni wanted it to be a men's only institution. So, even though we had compet - ing reasons, our interests were aligned.\" As a trustee, one of the things that Skerritt has been especially focused on is ensur - ing that there is an awareness of Kirkland on campus, and help - ing to bring Kirkland alumnae back to Hamilton. \"There are a lot of Kirkland alumnae who are really disenfranchised and have indicated that they have no in - terest in having any connection with Hamilton, which is such a shame.\" She adds that, \"I think we're making progress. I think that it's been enough time that people are ready to let that go and come back, and it's exciting to watch that happen.\" Skerritt added, \"Of one thing I am certain: if the two colleges had not merged, Hamilton would not be as strong an institution as it is now. During the past 30 years, the combination of Kirkland and Hamilton has evolved into an in - stitution that is still dedicated to the liberal arts, but now combines the revolutionary spirit of Kirk - land with the traditional history of Hamilton.\" Finally, Skerritt said that she loves having her son, Jeremy Gleason '11, on the Hill, and that it's a pleasure to see him when she comes to campus, adding: \"I am pleased that he can take advantage of what Hamilton of - fers now - that is, the distinctive combination that was created by the merger of Kirkland and Hamilton.\"Trustee Corner: Susan Skerritt K'77Student Media Representatives Travel to NYC The workshops, led by a professional in the field, covered anything from college media and freedom of expression, ghost writ - ing, interviewing, webcasting le - galities, literary journalism, mar - keting, innovative ways to cover sports and photojournalism, to resume and portfolio basics, in - vestigative reporting and online media. In one of the sessions, \"Sourcing: how to get people to talk when they shouldn't,\" Dennis Berman, Wall Street Journal col - umnist and 2003 Pulitzer Award winner, explained how the WSJ reporters often work on stories where the parties involved refused to talk. He remarked to the eager audience that as a reporter, \"you need to present yourself as an in -dividual, to project trust. Always be upfront with people in terms of what the story is about.\" Berman also noted \"writing a story is like cutting your hair. You can stay still or keep moving.\" The reporters need to convey that the story is inevitable. However, Ber - man emphasized that it is impor - tant to make the interviewee feel that it is in their best interest to cooperate with the reporter. With the major points of view covered, the story will be more insightful and accurate. Hannah Fazio '10 ( Green Apple ) particularly enjoyed the workshops on design, saying, \"it seems to be a growing field with a growing importance, something people should definitely be getting into.\" Andrew Richardson '10, The Spectator 's Photography Editor, added, \"The conference was a valuable experience for everyone in attendance. The sessions gave valuable advice to help improve the story and composition of news photography.\" Kate Tummarello '11, The Spectator 's Editor-in- Chief, also acknowledged how \"this year the conference was especially helpful. We are currently in the middle of a redesign for our website, and a lot of the sessions were aimed at making websites and other new media tools more effective. In ad - dition, we got a lot of new ideas in terms of layout and content. We're experimenting with everything we learned.\" The Spectator staff also ben - efited from the newspaper's onsite cold-read critique. Richardson confessed, \"The administrators at the conference raved over the issues of The Spectator that were submitted for scrutiny, much to the surprise of the staff in attendance. I think we all came away from the conference with increased con - fidence knowing that all of our hard work is evident to outside observers.\" Tummarello agreed with other group member's sentiments, saying \"We are lucky enough to send Spectator staff members to the conference every year, and it's always a great experience. In ad - dition to staying in a gorgeous ho - tel in the middle of Times Square, we get a lot of great ideas for im - proving the paper. We're always looking for new ideas, and meet - ing editors from other schools is a good way to get them. It's benefi - cial to interact with other editors, since they're really the only other ones who understand the process of running a student newspaper.\" If you are a Twitterrer you might have noticed the conven - tion hashtag, #cmanyc10, where people tweeted useful comments on the workshops they attended. @Chronotope wrote, \"It's about the narrative and telling the story in every way possible says @ drewvigal,\" the New York Times Multimedia Editor.@KevinLock - er paraphrased Brian Stelter, New York Times reporter and conven - tion keynote speaker: \"Good tip: Online, as a story develops, say what you know, but also make clear what you don't know.\" Hamilton students at the convention also included Thomas Red Weather ). Participants were opti - mistic that they would be able to bring new expertise to media on the Hill.(From left) Assistant Dean of Students Lisa Magnarelli, J.B. Riffle BY ANDY RICHARDSON '10 PHOTO BY VICKERS & BEECHLERFEATURES 8 April 1, 2010 Clare Brown '11, NC Each member of our all-girl entourage was assigned to a different class in the 550 student rural elementary in Burgaw, Pender County, North Carolina. Every morning our blue van rolled into the gravel parking lot and after a quick stop in the main office for our bright green visitor stickers, which shone on our t-shirts as invitation for cheesy smiles, whiny complaints or waist-high hugs, we greeted our energetic classes. The most important message we hoped to instill in the youngsters was the impor - tance of a college education. We all had a weeklong taste of life as an elementary school teacher and wanted our students to be continually challenged. We spent time with students working on individual strug - gles and preparing for testing. Despite the challenges we faced, we all grew from the experience. This was a wonderful opportunity to spend a week in a classroom that was vastly different that the ones in which we learn at Hamilton. In the classroom I was placed, with Miss Lane's second graders, the students were all fall - ing out of their seats as their hands shot up to answer each question the teacher posed. I wonder what it would be like if we still had that lack of inhibition and were always eager to participate in class. Regardless, it was a great opportunity and hope that the ASB program continues to grow.Emily Anderson '13, WV Pendleton County, West Virginia has one red light intersection, one flashing light and one three-way stop. We knew that we would be headed to somewhere rural, but had not quite appre - ciated just how rural. The Almost Heaven Habitat for Humanity Center is located in Centerville, 30 minutes from the work site in more populous Franklin (where there is a grocery store). At the work site we worked on two houses that will be two-story, three-family units. The central unit is designed for a family, and the two side units for older people. We had the opportunity to meet some of the Habitat families at a community dinner, which made the work a lot more meaningful. We were surprised to find that at the work site we were trusted to use many construction tools, including saws and drills\u2014and even operate the lift. We spent most of the week putting up siding, which looked very profes - sional by the end of the week. Julie Meurer '11, TN Our group went to Soddy-Daisy, Tensenessee to work with the Cumberland Trails Conference. The Cumberland Trail (CT) is primarily a hiking trail, designed and built to minimize the potential environmental impact on sensitive wildlife habitat, unique aquatic and terrestrial habitats and endangered or threatened species. The CT will eventually become part of the Great Eastern Trail,an alternative to the crowed Ap - palachian. The CT has been and continues to be constructed by volunteer groups. Housed in the summer camp cabins of the First Baptist Church of Chattanooga, our group got the chance to work with and get to know students from many other col - leges. Together we worked to connect sections of trails built by students during the previous weeks. Equipped with the necessary tools, we hiked between a half mile and two miles into our sites daily. Our responsibilities ranged from digging side-hill- cuts and removing the layers of \"duff\" to building steps and cribbing walls with mini boulders. On our day off we explored downtown Chattanooga where we visited the zoo, helped search for a lost puppy, and raced go-carts.Kevin Graepel '11, NC No one ever went to Old Cherry Street in Winston-Salem, NC if they could help it\u2014not until Habitat for Humanity moved in. The twenty- five year-old affiliate purchased and demolished two-dozen flop (AKA crack) houses in the neighborhood, and they needed help rebuilding them. We, eleven light-hearted college students, packed ourselves into a jitney with less personal space than a Dunham quad and drove twelve hours, playing \"Hey Cow!\" along the way. Expecting to sleep in a dingy church basement, we were pleasantly surprised to find the enormous loft above the HFH office. It had been in use by college students for a decade, and each group had left its mark in paint upon the walls (our signature, of course, prominently featured Al Ham!). It was a trip full of firsts for many of us: hot and fresh Krispy Kreme donuts at the origi - nal location, celebrity status at Chick-fil-A, roofing and vinyl siding, a lecture by Spike Lee at Wake Forest and southern hospitality. The residents of Winston-Salem fed us like royalty and spoke to us with honesty, kindness, and gratitude. I think we'd all go back in an instant. Lindsay Getman '10, GA Our ASB trip of 11 volunteers traveled to Atlanta, Georgia to work with an organization called Community Collaborations. After two days of driving in the jitney, we arrived at HQ\u2014a converted church with a trailer in the back for showers\u2014 where we ate breakfast and dinner and slept in the male and female \"quarters\" with about 100 other volunteers. We worked on a variety of different projects throughout the city. One day we helped clear brush and leaves for a woman who had recently moved into a new home after be - ing displaced by the floods in September. Another day, part of the group worked at an organic commu - nity garden while the others worked at an organization where people transitioning from rehab, homelessness or escaping domestic violence could receive free furniture for their new apartments. Overall, we had a really positive experience working in Atlanta. We worked with some great Americorps members and got the chance to explore the city quite a bit, including a visit to Martin Luther King Jr.'s childhood home, the Olympic Centennial Park and a delicious dinner at The Flying Biscuit, a restaurant owned by the Indigo Girls. Andrew Menges '12, MS We accomplished a variety of tasks on a number of different houses during our time with Habitat for Humanity in Hancock County, Mississippi. Our first few days were spent at one house finishing up the painting and caulking the outsides, building window frames and shelves, and putting mould - ing in on the floors. At times it was very frustrating and tedious work but after our time at that house it really felt like we accomplished a lot and I think everyone in our group felt a real sense of achievement. Later in the week we also started an entirely new house. We completed almost the whole foun - dation and built an entire porch! Unfortunately, we did not get to meet any of the individuals we were actually building the houses for because the houses we worked on did not have buyers yet. We did, however, get to at - tend a ribbon cutting ceremony for a Habitat for Hu - manity house that had just been bought by a woman directly affected by Hurricane Katrina. It was an eye-opening experience to see her nearly break down into tears of happiness and gratitude when she thanked Habitat and it gave our group an idea of just what we were accomplishing and how big of a difference we were actually making. We also became really close with Stephen, the contractor who was overseeing the house we worked on the first few days. He was only 23 and Habi - tat for Humanity was his full-time career. Seeing someone as dedicated to this cause as he was gave us something to aspire to in our own work. Katrina Raebler '12, Washington, D.C. Students on the ASB trip to Washington, D.C. performed various acts of community service through the Pilgrimage, a unique organization that focuses on gaining a deeper understanding of homeless - ness by encouraging students to interact with people who are or were previously homeless. Though - out the trip,the group worked with different organizations throughout D.C. to help fight hunger and home - lessness in the nation's capital. They teamed up with Food and Friends to package meals for people with life- threatening diseases, aided Parks and People in picking up trash and mulch - ing trees in a once-dangerous and garbage overrun park and did house and yard work for an elderly woman through Christian Community Group Homes. Thrive DC, a soup kitchen, was probably the group's favorite location. Lastly, they visited Com - munity for Creative Non-Violence, a homeless shelter, where they talked with homeless men, and then Capi - tal Area Food Bank where they sorted and boxed food for distribution. At the end of the week, the ASBers agreed that the message was clear: there is no stereotypical homeless person.

We will perform seven con - certs in seven cities in seven days, a very hectic schedule. Our first stop is in Albany, a short two-hour bus ride from campus. We arrive at the church for our concert greeted by several drunks all dressed in green from the St. Patrick's parade earlier in the day, but thankfully none of them at - tend our concert that evening in the beautiful St. Peter's Episcopal Church. It's painfully obvious that we have not quite learned all of our music (I have 18 songs in my mu - sic folder), but we have six more concerts to go where we can improve.Sunday, March 14 - Burlington We have all lost an hour of sleep from setting the clocks forward, and everyone looks sleep-deprived from their homestay as a consequence. The ensuing bus ride to Burling - ton is a quiet one. After a quick lunch at the local mall and a short rehearsal at the church in Burlington, we are let loose to explore this quaint town. Over half the choir it seems ended up at American Flatbread Company for dinner (the pizzas were fabulous) and at Ben and Jerry's for dessert. Monday, March 15 - Boston Our next concert is at Old South Church in downtown Boston. When we're dropped off at Quincy Market early that afternoon, however, we are subjected to a full-blown monsoon. Streets are littered with broken umbrellas sitting in large puddles. Some students do not leave Quincy Market for those few hours and the ones who do come back soaked. Our concert that night was one to remember. The audience was filled with alumni, and on a double choir piece, Director Rob Kolb decided to split the choirs and place them in the opposite balconies above the au - dience. The result was a majestic sound, and we stuck with this new formation for the rest of the tour. Tuesday, March 16 - Ridgefield, CT Waking up to clear blue skies and warm temperatures this morning after the miserable weather for the last three days is an amazing sight. We have free time in Boston this morning before leaving for Ridgefield, and everyone takes advantage of the sunshine to explore. Newbury Avenue, the Charles River and Faneuil Hall are some of the sights we see. Once we arrive at the church, everyone lies out in the grass to soak up the sun while others throw footballs and frisbees. The forecast for the rest of the week is good. Friday, March 19 - Philadelphia We spent the morning on the National Mall. In the seventy-degree weather, a large group of us walks to all the monuments - Lincoln Memorial, Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the White House and the Jefferson Memorial. But it takes us six hours to drive from Washington to Philadelphia that afternoon. For a 7:30 p.m. concert, we arrive at the church at 7:05! We hastily eat dinner, set up the risers, and get dressed for our final concert (we manage to start at 7:38, a noble feat). During the breaks between songs, everyone has to cough. It's overwhelming and downright comical to witness. This has been a really fun tour, but considering everyone's health and lack of sleep, it is for the best that we all head home tomorrow.Wednesday, March 17 - New York City It is St. Patrick's Day, and the choir is in New York City under blue skies and temperatures in the seventies. After a brief rehearsal in the morning, we have all afternoon to explore this amazing city. I chose visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art (crossing the St. Pat - rick's Day parade on Fifth Avenue) and then take a ferry ride out to Statue of Liberty in the beautiful weather. The concert that night, at the Church of the Good Shepherd on E 31st Street has been our best so far. The acoustics were marvelous and the pews were packed with family, friends and alumni. Thursday, March 18 - Washington, D.C. We have free time in New York this morning be - fore leaving for Washington, but most everyone chooses to sleep instead. A different bed (or air mattress or yoga mat) each night does not allow anyone to catch up on sleep from the first night where we lost an hour of sleep from setting the clocks forward. After a long, traffic-filled drive, we arrive at the church in Arlington, Virginia for a quick meal and another concert. Sleeping in this morning did little since we are all still wiped out by this point in the tour. PHOTO BY JESSICA COX '10ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT 10 April 1, 2010 MUSIC (billboard.com) Top Song S 1.

The scenery was not elaborate, but the red The elaborate masks await their performers before the show. WWW.FACEBOOK.COMlighting helped set the tone for what would prove to be a unique performance. Before debuting their production, the cast rehearsed for six weeks under the direction of D.A. Brockmann '13, whose theatrical company, House of Brockmann, developed this original show. Cirque du Mort is the story of Sofia, a young girl played by Rebecca Behrens '11, whose curiosity gets the best of her when she gets drawn into the strange world of the circus.

Among the more bizarre elements were the cackling laughter that erupted at odd moments and the screams that came from the innocent Sofia.

The Opus Playlist ADVERTISEMENTS 11 April 1, 2010 SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY 12 April 1, 2010 by Ben Trachtman '12 sCieNCe ANd teChNology editorHarvard Professor Daniel Schacter Visits Hamilton, Discusses Memory and Cognition Before spring break, Ham - ilton hosted Dr. Daniel Schact - er, professor of psychology at Harvard University and one of the leading researchers in the field of memory and cognitive psychology. Dr. Schacter pre - sented some of his most recent findings on how memories are formed in the brain and how thinking about the past relates to imagining the future. Even though he has been a mainstay of memory research for decades, he is still on the leading edge in the field, using new technologies and ingenious techniques to help solve the mystery of memory. For years, memory re - search had been focused on how we store and later retrieve memories\u2014what makes certain events more or less memorable or how memories are forgotten, for example. Still, there was no way to investigate the underly - ing neural mechanisms of these processes other than to observe how patients with damage to cer - tain areas of the brain respond to memory tasks. This research showed that the structure primar - ily responsible for the formation of long-term memories is the hippocampus, which is located in the center of the brain. However, recent advance - ments in neuroimaging tech - niques have allowed researchers to effectively look inside an ac - tive brain. These types of scans can show what parts of a brain are active and when. Dr. Schacter has applied this new technology to an older field and has begun looking at an active hippocampus in depth. These studies, which he presented in his talk, show that the hippocampus is involved in long-term memory formation as predicted. However, they also show that it plays another cru - cial role: giving us the ability to imagine the future. Dr. Schacter's neuroimaging studies have shown that the area of the hippocampus towards the back of the head is the region re - sponsible for long-term memo - ries. This region can be seen to be more active when a person observes something that later testing shows he remembers. This information alone would be impossible to obtain in earlier studies relying on patients with brain damage. However, an even more fas - cinating finding was that the part of the hippocampus towards the front of the head was the most active when the participant was imagining future events. In this way, the hippocampus is less like our window into the past, as was previously thought, but more like our mental time travel station. It gives us the ability to relive ex - periences from our past, as well as picture what might happen in our future. Psychology professor Mark Oakes, who introduced Dr. Schacter, was impressed with Dr. Schacter's contributions to the field. Oakes, who also research - es memory, was interested in the implications of Dr. Schacter's re - search. \"Does the process and struc - ture of [memory] recombination dif - fer for autobio - graphical events?\" he asked. \"Does the inclusion of emotional events moderate where this recombina - tion takes place? How different is the creation of a false memory from the recom - bination of elements to create a future event?\" These are still all pressing questions in the field that could be answered as research such as Dr. Schacter's advances. Technology is still the lim - iting factor in memory research and most psychological and neurological research. Although we have tools that psychologists from the 1950's could nev - er imagine, they still have their limitations. fMRI, the primary technique that Dr. Schacter uses, is very effective at showing where changes occur in the brain, but cannot provide detailed information about how activity changes over a short timespan. Future advancements in the tech -nology that would allow for both spatial and temporal accuracy could be key to the understand - ing of complicated neurologi - cal processes such as memory. For now, though, it takes an ex - traordinary researcher like Dr. Schacter to make the most of the available tools and unravel more and more about how the human mind works. Neuro. Department Hires New Professor The neuroscience department will have a new faculty member next semester. Dr. Jeremy Skip - per, previously at the Weill Medi - cal College of Cornell University was selected for the position after a search by the department narrowed the field to three candidates. Each of these three gave a presentation on their research earlier in the year; Dr. Skipper's talk focused on his studies of language localization in the brain. His research used neu - roimaging techniques including electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance im -aging (fMRI) to show that language is spread out over a much larger area of the brain than was origi - nally thought. He also showed that language incorporates much more than the spoken word and identified brain regions that help to integrate context and body language into our understanding of language. Dr. Skipper will teach a labo - ratory course in neuroscience next spring and intends to start the \"Lan - guage, Action and Brain\" (LAB) Lab at Hamilton. The lab's long- term goal is similar to Dr. Skipper's previous research: to further study how the brain integrates informa - tion relevant to language and forms a complete idea of the spoken word. Jeremy Skipper's work here at Hamilton will explore language in the brain outside of the traditional pathway.THEBRAIN.MCGILL.CAby Ben Trachtman '12 sCieNCe ANd teChNology editorScience News Off-Campus This Week... Physicists Begin to Unravel the Big Bang Scientists at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a nearly 17-mile long par - ticle accelerator near Geneva, Switzerland, have continued to make groundbreak - ing advancements in particle physics. They recently succeeded in smashing two protons, pieces of an atomic nucleus, together with more three times more force than had previously been attempted. This experiment, and other similar ones con - ducted by the LHC are designed to gain information about the state of the universe microseconds after the Big Bang as well as find the elusive Higgs Boson, a particle theorized to be responsible for giving matter its mass. This most recent advance - ment is sure to be one of many coming out of the LHC in the future. Fatty Foods Could Be as Addictive as Cocaine A recent study found that foods high in fat and calories alter the brain chemis - try of rats in a similar way to cocaine. Rats allowed to gorge themselves on these fatty foods quickly developed an addiction that scientists attribute to the over - stimulation of pleasure and reward centers in the brain. These areas are driven by the neurotransmitter dopamine, the same one affected by cocaine in both rats and humans. Rats addicted to food in this fashion would even risk an electric shock to eat, whereas normal rats immediately shied away. This study provides a new di - mension to obesity research, showing that overeating might not be merely a prob - lem of willpower, but rather a physiological compulsion. Apple Launches New Flagship Product On Saturday, Apple will release the first iPads, a touch-screen tablet com - puter that can function as an e-reader, laptop and mobile media station, and demand is already high. Seton Hill University in Pennsylvania is planning to give all of its students iPads in the fall to help encourage collaborative learning and promote the use of electronic textbooks. Similar programs have been instituted at other schools in the past, such as Duke providing students with iPods. The iPad, which is only half an inch thick and weighs 1.5 pounds, starts at about $500 for the wi-fi only, 16-gigabyte model. Models with larger hard drives or 3G capability are more expensive.Professor Schacter uses neuroimaging to study the regions of the brain involved in memory, such as the hippocampus and the amygdala (left).

MIT Study Finds that Students Who Copy Answers Receive Lower Grades by Yinghan Ding '12 sCieNCe & t eChNology writer Do you think you are too smart to do your homework? Do you think that you can get a good grade on the test even if you regularly copy someone else's homework? If so, you need to think again before your next midterm, because a detailed study at the Massachusetts In - stitute of Technology (MIT) confirms: homework really is important for learning academic material. In fact, students who regularly copied problem sets from others earned lower grades and were three times more likely to fail the class than their more diligent classmates. The study was led by a group of professors in the phys - ics department at MIT. The re - search team tracked homework for four consecutive terms of introductory physics. The stu - dents at MIT complete their physics homework by using an online assignment system, and since all of the students' entries to problems are time-stamped, the research team was able to determine how quickly the stu - dents completed the problems once the question appeared on the screen. After looking at the data, the team separated the students into three groups based on how long it took them to do the problems: about 10 minutes, a day or two, or about one minute. Students could not work out problems in advance because they were only presented one at a time. The re - searchers initially credited the students who were solving the problems in less than a minute to intelligent MIT students, but suspicions soon arose. The team soon realized that most students would not have even had time to read the questions by the time those in the quick-solving group had an - swered the problem. The team suspected that these students had a cheat sheet, making it possible for these students to get a cor - rect answer without a need to read and work out the problem. By assuming that the faster answers were being given off of these cheat sheets, the team found that about half the stu -dents copied less than 10 per - cent of their homework, about 40 percent copied 10 to 50 per - cent of their homework, and about 10 percent of the students copied more than half of their homework. The team decided to focus on these homework-copying suspects and track their perfor - mances in the course. As ex - pected, copying had its price. The team found that, by the end of the semester, students who copied 50 percent or more homework earned on average almost two letter grades below students who didn't copy very much. Frequent copiers were also three times more likely to fail the course. \"Homework copying is severely impeding students' learning, and teachers don't take it seriously enough,\" said David Pritchard, a member of the research team. \"It's a killer for the grades and a killer for the students.\" The study also brings to light a number of other inter - esting facts about students' study habits and demographics. Students who decided to copy someone else's homework were much more likely to have put off most of the assignment until the last minute, and copying rates increased dramatically after the first midterm. The majority of the most frequent copiers were WWW.SCIENCENEWS.ORG male. The class was mostly populated by freshman who had not yet declared a major, but perhaps most interestingly, later analyses showed a trend of copiers opting to be business majors.The study compared how students performed on tests with how frequently they copied others' answers on homework.

SCCT Atrium.Wacky Facts: Dinosaurs The first document - ed discovery of dinosaur fos - sils was in 1676 when a jaw belonging to a megalosaurus was found in Oxford, England. Studies of large resonance chambers in the skulls of dinosaurs have revealed that many dinosaurs might have been able to produce sounds similar to that of French horns. Smaller dinosaurs were able to run at approximately 27 miles per hour, while larger ones had a slower lumber closer to four miles per hour. The fastest re - corded human speed is just over 27 miles per hour, set by Usain Bolt. Scientists believe that dino - saurs originally evolved feathers as a way to regulate their body temperature. Some dinosaurs were able to take advantage of their feathers and used them for flight. The smallest of the flying dino - saurs were about the size of a robin. The largest dinosaurs were also the largest land animals in history. The largest skeleton found was of a 38 foot tall bra - chiosaurus. The largest flying animal was a contemporary of the dinosaurs, but not actually a dinosaur itself. It was a spe - cies of pterosaur, a flying reptile, with a wingspan of about 40 feet. Jellyfish have been on earth in their current form for about 650 million years, even lon - ger than dinosaurs. Sharks and horseshoe crabs are also living fossils that predate the dinosaurs.

The Continentals, playing in the semifinal of the NESCAC Tournament at Bowdoin's Sid - ney J. Watson Arena, stayed with the Division III power - house for most of the contest but faltered late in the game. Bowdoin led 1-0 after a goal midway through the first period, but Tom Chiappetta '11 responded with a goal in the second period on the assist of Joe Houk '13 to make it 1-1. Bowdoin, however, exploded in the third period, taking a 5-1 lead with four unanswered scores. Jerome Wallace '10 brought the score to 5-2 with an assist from Chiapetta. It was a barrage the Continentals could not overcome, partially due to their inadequacy on the power play (0-for-5), and eventually Bowdoin sealed the deal via an empty net goal with just over a minute left. Despite allowing five of the six goals, first-year goaltender Calvin Bartel '13 performed valiantly, stopping 32 of the 37 shots he faced. Hamilton finishes the 2009-2010 season with a 15-9-2 record, matching the 15-wins of their 2003-2004 campaign. One of this year's highlights was an impressive and unex - pected playoff run in which the Continentals beat third-seeded Williams by a score of 2-1 in the NESCAC quarterfinal. Hamilton had two players, forward Anthony Scarpino '12 and defenseman BJ Lalonde '11, voted to the all-NESCAC second team. Additionally, head coach Norm Bazin was selected NESCAC Coach of the Year, an award which reflects the late surge that saw the Con - tinentals finish the season on a 10-3-1 run. The season finale at Bow - doin, however, should be con - sidered more of a beginning than an end. While they will lose several top scorers in se - niors Chris Lorenc and Vaclav Tomicek, as well as veteran leaders like Jerome Wallace, Marc Trostle, Harry Biggs and backup goalie Ian Stearns, the Continentals coaching staff has brought in a great deal of young talent in the last two years. Next season's prospects look especially promising, as the Continentals will return a host of experienced players in - cluding captain Joe Buicko '11, Chiapetta, Scarpino, Lalonde and Bartel, a goalie who will certainly get better after an outstanding first year. Overall, the men's hockey team will return eight of their top nine scorers, and that group is already looking to prove that this year's NESCAC semifinal appearance was no fluke and that they will again be a con - tender during the 2010-2011 season.

Although playing the first eight games of the season on away or neutral turf might be intimidating to most teams, the Continentals started strong and are currently riding a six-game winning streak. The team played their sea - son-opener on March 14 against SUNY Oneonta. Rachel Fried - man '13 set the tone with a goal just 48 seconds into the game, and the Continentals went on to outshoot the Red Dragons 44-24. Friedman had a team high four goals, with Liz Rave '10 and Hil - ary Saverin '10 each contributing Sarah Bray Anne Graveley '11 apiece. Marchesi '13, Libby Schultz '12 and Mariah Monks '13 each put in one to round out the 21-12 romp. Kate Fowler '10 spent the game in goal, putting up nine saves. During spring break, the team traveled to San Antonio, Texas to play in a tournament at St. Mary's University. Their first opponent was Bowdoin College, who entered the game 1-1 after a thrilling two-overtime win over Wesleyan and a subsequent loss to Stevens College while in San Antonio. Hamilton controlled 11 of 16 draws in the first period, and led 9-6 at the half. Another solid defensive performance from seniors Matilda Anders - son and Kayla Bettenhauser and sophomores Rebekah Gibson and Lauren Sokol resulted in a 13-11 victory over the Polar Bears. Rave and Graveley each notched three this time, with Nebergall and Bray each adding two. Hamilton's second match in San Antonio was against Spring - field College. After Rave scored less than two minutes into the game, the Continentals led for the remainder of the game. Fowler had five saves, and held the Pride scoreless for over 15 consecu - tive minutes of play during the first and second half. Sam Elie '13 also saw some net time, and finished with three saves. The Continentals outshot the Pride 30-19 and made good on seven free position shots to cruise to a 16-7 win. Rave and Nebergall had three goals each; Bray, and Graveley had two each; and Kriti Dave '11, Friedman, Han - nah Hoar '13 and Caroline Mor - gan '13 all put one in. Bray had two assists while Dave had one. The team returned to over - cast skies and drizzle for a March 23 match-up against SUNY Cort - land. Fowler had another great performance, finishing with nine saves in a very close contest. The score was tied 4-4 at the half, and the two teams exchanged the lead several times before Friedman finally put the game-clincher in the back of the net with less than two minutes remaining in regu - lation. Otley and Friedman both contributed an assist, and Bray added two assists of her own. Bray and Friedman each had two goals, while Rave, Graveley, Saverin and Hoar all added one goal in the 8-7 triumph. The next road-trip was to Rochester to take on Nazareth College on March 26. Nebergall tallied a whopping five goals in the 16-9 rout. Fowler put up seven saves. The Continentals scooped up 21 groundballs to the Golden Flyers' five, and outshot Naz 47-19. The following day the Conti - nentals were once again in West - ern New York, this time playing against St. John Fisher. Though they were only up by one at the half, Hamilton gradually pulled away thanks to three goals each from Bray, Otley and Friedman, as well as two by Rave and one each from Nebergall, Graveley and Schultz. Fowler had another five saves, and Elie added one more during her minutes in goal to seal the win. The Continentals will play two more on the road before fi - nally getting the chance to host a game on Steuben Field. They travel to Rensselaer and Vassar this weekend to play in their first two Liberty League matches of the season.

That goal has already been accomplished: as March comes to an end, the team's re - cord is already 6-0. Despite the loss of eight seniors, the Continentals are off to an electric start in 2010. Carried by points leaders Henry Burchenal '12 and 2009 Lib - erty League Rookie of the Year Jon Leanos '12, Hamilton has victories against Utica College, Sewanee University, Lasell Col - lege, Drew University, Cazeno - via College and SUNY Oneonta. Leanos shined with an eight point performance against Sewanee, and Burchenal '12 tallied seven points (six goals) in Hamilton's 17-5 rout vs. Cazenovia College. Although all their games have been non-league, they sit atop the Liberty League (along with Union and Rensselaer) with six wins. Hamilton's senior cap - tains include Franke Holiber, Rob Dickson and Alex Duncan. Holiber and Dickson are both three-year letter winners for the lacrosse team. Holiber was named to the All-League second team last season, and Dickson received honorable mention on defense. Just a few weeks into the season, several Continentals have already received weekly awards within the Liberty League. Burch - enal was named the league's Co- Offensive Player of the Week on March 15. Leanos, Paul Armideo '13 and goaltender Garrett Akie '12 all received honors on March 22, following Hamilton's victo - ries over Sewanee and Lasell. Akie leads the Liberty League, allowing just 3.88 goals against per game. Leanos and Burchenal have been outstanding on attack so far this season. Burchenal leads the Liberty League in goals scored with 16, and they both rank among the top three in points scored in the league through five games (Burchenal had 22, Leanos had 19). Leanos, who received hon - orable mention on attack last season, played a big part in the team's win against Drew Uni - versity's squad in Madison, NJ. Coincidentally, his father, Tom Leanos, coaches the Drew team. Leanos scored the game-winning goal with less than three minutes left in the fourth quarter to help give the team its first 4-0 start since 2006. Leanos was featured in a newspaper article in New Jer - sey's Daily Record last week. The article highlighted the fam - ily reunion that day in Madison. \"Obviously I wanted our team to win, but I certainly was happy for him. Every father wants his children to do well, and I cer - tainly was not upset about losing to my son. This is no different than him beating me in basketball on our driveway\" said Tom Leanos. Jon's thoughts on the game were similar as he said \"[my fa - ther] wants me to do well, but before the game, I know he was more focused on his team.'' After such a hot start, Ham - ilton has very high hopes for the rest of the season. The Continen - tals hope to earn their second-ever bid to the NCAA Championships; they received their first bid at the end of the 2003 season. Hamilton hosts a league game this Saturday against Rens - selaer and another on Wednesday, Apr. 7 against Union College. St. Lawrence University's na - tionally-ranked squad will play the Continentals in their regular season finale on May 1. Baseball Wins Home Opener by David Meisel '13 sports writer Believe it or not, the Ham - ilton men's baseball season is already halfway done following the team's trip to Florida over spring break. After a disap - pointing 3-9 stretch to start the 2010 season, the Continentals returned home to Royce Field. It seems the return to cold weather helped, as the team went on to sweep a doubleheader against SUNY Cobleskill on March 28. Their three wins down south came against Sewanee, Colby (with whom the Continen - tals split a doubleheader), and Wisconsin-Stout (another split doubleheader); The team has now won three of their last four games. Their nine losses were to McDaniel, Bowdoin (twice), UMass-Boston, UMass-Dart - mouth, Worcester State, Colby and Wisconsin-Stout. Hamilton set a school record with 14 wins in 2009, and with the core of last year's team returning, the expectations are even higher for 2010.
