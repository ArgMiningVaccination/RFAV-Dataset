Although the diagnosis is based on psychopathological criteria, it is frequently accompanied by somaticcomorbidities and perhaps \"accelerated biological aging,\" suggesting widespread physical concomitants. Such phys-iological comorbidities may affect core PTSD symptoms but are rarely the focus of therapeutic trials. Methods: Toelucidate the potential involvement of metabolism, inflammation, and mitochondrial function in PTSD, we integratefindings and mechanistic models from the DOD-sponsored \"Systems Biology of PTSD Study\" with previous data onthese Results: Data implicate inter-linked dysregulations in metabolism, inflammation, mitochondrial function, and perhaps the gut microbiome in PTSD. Several inadequately tested targets of pharmacological intervention are proposed, including insulin sensitizers, lipid mitochondrial biogenesis modulators.Conclusions:Systemicpathologiesthatareintricatelyinvolvedinbrainfunctioningandbehaviormaynotonlycontributeto somatic comorbidities in PTSD, but may represent novel targets for treating core psychiatric symptoms. INTRODUCTION The diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is basedonseveretraumaexposureandsymptomsintheclusters of intrusive re-experiencing, avoidance, and persistent nega-tive alterations in cognition, mood, and arousal. 1These crite- ria do not readily lend themselves to objective determination anddonottakeintoaccount underlyingbiologicalabnormal-ities. This makes pharmacological treatment difficult, since serotonin reuptake inhibitors, has limited efficacy. 2 *Department of Human Neurosciences, Sapienza University of Rome, Vialedell'Universit\u00e0 30, Rome 00185, Italy Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco (UCSF),School ofMedicine, 401 ParnassusAve, SanFrancisco, CA94143 Department of Medicine,513 Parnassus Ave,1464G, SanFrancisco, CA 94143 \u00a7Lund University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences Lund, Psychiatry, Lund, Sweden /bardblDepartment of Psychiatry and Institute of Behavioral Science in Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei-ro 50-1,Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, South Korea \u00b6Harvard John A.

Simplified hypothetical model of interactions between mito- chondrial dysfunction, metabolism, and inflammation in PTSD. (A) Inter- relationship of mitochondria and metabolic syndrome, (B) inter-relationshipof metabolic syndrome and inflammation, (C) inter-relationship of mito- chondriaandinflammation. Formore details, see Refs.5,35,4346,53,56 Accruing data suggest interlinked dysregulations in metabolism, inflammation, and mitochondrial function in PTSD (Fig.1).4,5Although neuropathological abnormalities are also observed in PTSD,6these are beyond the scope of this article, which limits itself to these three biochemical dysregulations. Systemic biochemical pathologies maycontribute both to the somatic comorbidities and the core psychiatric PTSD symptoms, since they are intricately involved in brain functioning and behavior. 5We propose several inadequately tested targets of intervention, including insulin sensitizers, anti-inflammatories, and mitochondrial biogenesis modulators ( Table 1). We integrate recently acquired data from the Department of Defense (DOD)- sponsored \"Systems Biology of PTSD Study\" and other recentstudies7-12withpreviousclinicaldataandsuggestnovel treatment targets. METABOLISM PTSD is associated with MetS, obesity, DMII, and insulin resistance (IR); it has even been considered a \"metabolic disorder in disguise\".13MetS has a prevalence of 38.7% in PTSD ( p<0.001) and an almost double risk compared to controls.14Abdominal obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyc- eridemia, hyperglycemia, and low high density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels are observed in PTSD.14The rates of MetS do not differ in combat vs. non-combat PTSD, men vs. women, or individuals with comorbid major depressive disorder(MDD) vs.thosewithout.14 PTSD is also associated with increased DMII, even after controllingforMDDandotherpsychiatricillnesses.4,5,9MetS and DMII are prognostic of CVD and could contribute to theincreased morbidity and mortality seen in PTSD. 4Although itisdifficulttocontrolforlifestylefactorsandmedicationsin assessingMetSandDMIIinPTSD,MetSandDMIIincreaserisk for somatic illness and add pose additional targets for intervention. MetS and DMII may also contribute to core neuropsy- chiatric symptoms of PTSD. They may be associated withdeleteriouseffectsinthecentralnervoussystem,forexample, heightened vulnerability to brain injury, neurodegenerative disorders, diminished cortical and brain energetics, altered free-fatty acids of brain cell membranes, andalteredadipokinesignalinginthebrain. 17Wolfetal.16found thatPTSDpredictedMetS,whichinturnwasassociatedwith reducedcorticalthicknessandconcludedthat\"PTSDconfersriskforcardiometabolicpathologyandneurodegenerationand raises concern that this cohort may be aging prematurely and at risk for substantial medical and cognitive decline\". Apolygenic risk score (PRS) associated with obesity interacts with PTSD to predict MetS, with MetS, DMII,andrelateddisturbances,althoughnotallpatientswithPTSDdemonstratesuchmetabolicdisturbances,highlighting theneedforsubcategorizingpatientswhenconsideringtarget- basedtherapies.Specificpharmacologicaltreatmentstrategiesare discussedbelow. INFLAMMATION Elevations of inflammatory markers are among the mostwidely replicated biological abnormalities in PTSD. 19It has even been suggested that PTSD is an \"immunological disorder.\"19Most often elevated are interferon gamma, interleukin 6, and interleukin 1 beta; tumor necrosis factor alpha is also elevated in medication-free individuals with PTSD.20Increased inflammation in PTSD is observed even after controlling for age, body-mass index (BMI), smoking, early life trauma, depression, and potentially interferingmediationsandsomaticcomorbidities.11Providing support for intrinsic inflammatory changes in PTSD, DNA methylation,andtranscriptomicstudieshaveidentifiedPTSD- associated dysregulation of genes and pathways related toinflammation andimmunefunction. 21 The inflammatory status of individuals with PTSD may contribute to their high medical comorbidity and to theirincreasedincidenceofautoimmunedisorders. 22However,not allindividualswithPTSDhaveelevatedinflammatoryindices, and in those that do, their elevations are rarely to the extentseen in primaryinflammatory diseases. Moststudiesassessedblood-basedmarkers,andtheirrela- tionship with neuroinflammation is not known. However, immune activation may also be found in the cerebrospinal 312 MILITARY MEDICINE, Vol. 185, January/February Supplement 2020Novel Pharmacological Targets for Combat PTSD TABLE 1.

These may also contribute to brainpathology and alterations in behavior via alterations of the tryptophan/kynurenineratio,shortchainfattyacidproduction and alterations in BBB permeability. tionsbetweenthegutmicrobiome,impairedIBF,andinflam- mation in PTSD. However, a recent study civilians with PTSD found that decreased Actinobacteria, Lentisphaerae,andVerrucomicrobiataxaplayaroleinmain-taining IBF; these decreases were directly correlated with PTSD severity. 32Another study in stress-exposed soldiers identified associations between reduced relative abundanceof Actinobacteria muciniphilia glucose homeostasis viarestorationofIBF,suggestingthattheobservedgutmicro- biomealterationsmaycontributenotonlytoinflammationbutalso tometabolism-related medical co-morbidities. In summary, increased inflammatory markers are fre- quently reported in PTSD; these may contribute to somaticcomorbidities and autoimmune diseases. Anti-inflammatory therapies could prove useful in selected individuals with MILITARY MEDICINE, Vol. 185, January/February Supplement 2020 313Novel Pharmacological Targets for Combat PTSD FIGURE 2.

Formore details, see Refs.5,36,52,6468 evidenceofincreasedinflammation,asdiscussedbelow.Such strategies have investigated in individuals with major depression.33 MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION Mitochondria play a key role in maintaining cellular home-ostasis,producingenergyandgeneratingfreeradicals(which canbebeneficialatlowtomoderatelevelsorharmfulathigher levels), regulating oxidative stress, stress responses, and endocrine and neuronal signaling, have been identified in postmortem human brain samples fromsubjectswithPTSD. 37-40TheDOD\"SystemsBiologyof PTSD\"studyalsoidentifiedgenesassociatedwithmitochon- trauma-exposed control subjects.41Metabolomic analysis showed that PTSD subjects had increased plasma levels of glucose, pyruvate, and lactate along with reduced plasma levels of citrate (suggesting possible alterations inthe tricarboxylic acid cycle), and increased plasma levels of acylcarnitines (suggesting reduced mitochondrial glycolytic and fatty-acid beta-oxidation activities). 7PTSD subjects also had reduced concentrations of several essential fatty acids and omega 3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).7Omega- 3 insulin resistance and inflammation.43-46These metabolomic findings require replication in additional samples and establishing more direct correlations. Mitochondrial DNA copy number may also be reduced in leukocytes of PTSDsubjects, further suggesting altered energy metabolism. 10 Related mitochondrial findings have also been demonstratedinbrainsinanimal modelsofPTSD. 5,47-49 DirectstudiesofmitochondrialfunctioninPTSDhavenot yet been conducted.

NOVEL PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES Inflammation, metabolism, and mitochondrial functioning may be involved in medical comorbidities associated withPTSD. Targeting these may benefit core PTSD symptoms in addition to the somatic comorbidities ( Table 1andFig.2). Althoughthesedatashouldpromptfurtherinvestigation,nonehas yet been demonstrated to treat PTSD, and none is yet indicatedfor PTSD. Metabolism Available drugs for treating MetS and DMII have not yet been investigated in PTSD, although innovative studies have 314 MILITARY MEDICINE, Vol. 185, January/February Supplement 2020Novel Pharmacological Targets for Combat PTSD been conducted using such drugs in the treatment of MDD,50 Alzheimer'sdisease,andmildcognitiveimpairment.51Drugs such as thiazolidinediones and other insulin sensitizers, as well as metformin and other antidiabetic drugs and perhapspyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), should be investigated for psychiatric benefits beyond their currently recognized ben- efits in medical disorders. 43,45,52-57Of note, PPAR-gamma agonists also have anti-inflammatory effects, perhaps mak- ing them especially attractive candidates for investigation in PTSD.57A recent meta-analysis including all studies that examined the effects of established antidiabetic drugs on depressive symptoms (in non-PTSD populations) found that pioglitazone improved depression with a large effect size.58 ThesefindingssupportstudyingsuchdrugsinPTSD,althoughit is not known whether baseline metabolic dysregulation isrequiredforbeneficial responses. Inflammation Anti-inflammatoryagents(eg,nonsteroidalanti-inflammatorydrugs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, and could conceivablyhelpPTSD, 59,60havenot,toourknowledge,been investigated in PTSD in randomized clinical trials (RCTs).This is despite the fact that anti-inflammatory treatment is associatedwithantidepressanteffectsindepressedindividuals who have elevated pretreatment inflammatory markers, 33 and animal studies show that ibuprofen reduced cytokinesin tandem with reduced anxiety behaviors. 59Hydrocortisone, a potent anti-inflammatory, has been studied in PTSD with someevidenceofefficacy,61butthishasmultipleeffectsaside from anti-inflammatory ones. Omega-3 PUFAs also haveanti-inflammatory effects and have been studied in various psychiatric illnesses, 62b u tl e s ss oi nP T S D .O n eR C To f docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in PTSD found no overall ben-efit, but a secondary data analysis showed that subjects with greater increases in erythrocyte membrane eicosapentaenoic acid(EPA) showedsuperiorclinical responses. 63 Becauseoftherelativesafetyofseveralanti-inflammatories, webelievethatRCTsofanti-inflammatoriesshouldbeahigh research priority in selected patients in PTSD. Specificallytargetingpatientswithbaselineimmuneover-activationcould be important since, in MDD, infliximab, a TNF- blocker, significantly ameliorated depressive symptoms only in the subgroup with elevated pretreatment inflammatory markers, although those without elevated baseline inflammationworsened. 33 Mitochondria The potential of pharmacologically inducing mitochondrialbiogenesishasbeensuggestedinaseveralsomaticillnesses, 36 although this approach has not been studied in PTSD.As detailed in Figure2, medications such in preclinical models,71and ARBs and ACE- Is have shown efficacy in improving depression and anxiety in humans.71One study in traumatized subjects showed that thoseusingACE-IsorARBshadlessseverePTSDsymptoms thanthosewhodidnot.72Nonetheless,therearefewRCTson thetopic. sodium pyruvate, and -lipoic acid) have been proposed as therapeutic options for increasing mitochondrialfunctioning under conditions of inflammation or oxidative stress. 36Certain psychological symptoms improved to a greater extent in war veterans (although not specifically withPTSD) taking 100 mg/day of CoQ10 than in those taking placebo. 73Also, among veterans with PTSD and substance use disorders, those taking 2400 mg/day of NAC had greaterimprovements in PTSD than those receiving placebo plus psychotherapy. mitochondrial biogenesisactivation,however,isthatextensivelyupregulatedmitochondrialmassmaybedetrimentalratherthanbeneficial, suggestingan \"inverted-U\"typerelationship. 10,34,35 gut microbiomein PTSD, certain probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics have been shown to reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression in preclinical models, 75in healthy subjects, and in individuals with irritable bowel syndrome or chronic fatigue.75,76In one preclincial study, vaccination with a heat- killed preparation of Mycobacterium vaccae , an immuno- regulatory environmental microorganism, reduced PTSD- like symptoms77and was associated with an increased anti- inflammatory milieu. The relationship of the gut microbiomewithmetabolicdysregulationandinflammationhighlightsthe intertwinedrelationshipofseveralfactorsthatmaycontribute to PTSD. Additional study is required to characterize gut microbiome changes and to determine if its modulation can benefitPTSD. 31 SystemsBiology Additional targets of pharmacotherapy are suggested by net-workmedicineapproachesormechanisticsystemsmodellingapproaches 78. Network medicine identifies not only cellu- lar mechanisms, but also how these mechanisms may span different diseases, thereby potentially identifying novel drugtargets for seemingly unrelated diseases. Such approaches in the DoD \"Systems Biology of PTSD\" study suggested an association of glucocorticoid sensitivity with inflammation MILITARY MEDICINE, Vol. 185, January/February Supplement 2020 315Novel Pharmacological Targets for Combat PTSD and mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that modulating glucocorticoid receptor signaling may be effective in treating PTSD and concomitant somatic inflammation and mitochon- drialdysfunction(Ibid.). CONCLUSIONS We have focused on inflammatory, metabolic, and mitochon-drialdysfunctions,totheexclusionofseveralotherpathogenicpathways,becausetheyrepresentunder-studiedabnormalities in PTSD that may contribute and that arepotentiallyremediable.Theseabnormalitiesarenotseenin allindividualswithPTSD,andconversely,theseabnormalities arenonspecific,astheyarealsoinvolvedinotherillnesses.Weproposethatinflammatory,metabolic,andmitochondrialdys- functions,andperhapsgutdysbiosis,underliecertainsomatic andneuropsychiatricaspectsofPTSDincertainpatientswithPTSD. A critical consideration in designing future studies of the suggested novel interventions is identification of sub- groupsofpatientswithdistinctandrelevantbiologicalpertur-bations. 33Suchinterventionsshouldtargetspecificbiological abnormalities rather than diagnostic criteria alone. To the extent PTSD comes to be seen as a systemic medical condi-tion,or at least onewithsignificantmedical risksand comor- bidities,stigmawilldecrease,objectivebiomarkertestingwill become available, and treatment focus will shift from purelypsychologicalendpointstotreatment of thewholepatient.
