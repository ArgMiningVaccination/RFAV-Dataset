Assessing the effectiveness of the new university -wide Faculty Senate in providing a voice for faculty in shared governance of the institution ; 2. Regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the institution's part -time and full -time (nontenure track) faculty ; 3. Continuing to implement a comprehensive system of assessment of student ac hievement at the course, program, and institutional levels, demonstrating the use of results for program improvement . Letter to President Monaco , May 4, 2018 In addition to addressing to NECHE comments in the May 4, 2018 , letter and other subsequent letters, Tufts University identified the goals for the self -study process to be : 1) using the self -study as an opportunity for focused internal review ; 2) engaging the brea dth of the university population (faculty, staff, students, trustees) in the review; and 3) ensuring diverse representation across gender, ethnic , and racial backgrounds, physical campuses, academic disciplines, and schools throughout all stages of the review. To that end, i n fall of 2020, President Anthony P. Monaco and then-Provost Nadine Aubry appointed Dawn Geronimo Terkla, associate provost and accreditation liaison officer, and Marty Ray, chief of staff and senior advisor to the president , as the Steering Committee co-chairs to lead the self-study process . The co-chairs , in consultation with the president and provost, identified potential working groups and Steering Committee members , who were invited to participate in summer 2021 . In the spirit of the self - study goals mentioned above, c are was taken to ensure broad representation from across the university community . In all, nine university -wide working groups were formed in summer 2021 to address each accreditation standard. Nearly 1 20 faculty, staff, administrators, students, trustees, and alumni were involved throughout the academic year 2021 -2022 in these groups, gathering information, sharing their personal knowledge and experience, and providing analyses of the effectiveness of the university. Working group members directly solicited information and data from approximately 200 members of the Tufts community. In addition to the working group chairs who formed the core of the Steering Committee, the committee comprises the executive vice president, a representative from the Pr ovost's Office of Faculty Affairs, the director of institutional research , and a project manager , ensuring a committee that provided a variety of institutional perspective s. Public comment and community input was sought through campus -wide emails and websi te updates in November 2021, September 2022, and January 2023. The Office of Institutional Research (OIR) began work on the Data First Forms in 20 20. The co-chairs held a kick-off event for the self -study process in September 20 21, and working groups began meeting shortly thereafter. As working groups completed their work, working group chairs submitted their standard narratives to the Steering Committee for review. The Steering Committee discussed each narrative and reviewed each one in context with other standards. Throughout spring and summer 20 22, the narrative draft, Data First Forms, and E and S Forms were continuously updated. Additionally, the University Faculty Senate shared a response to an early draft of the self- study in May 2022, and future revisions were made with their comments in mind. In August 2022, co- chairs requested feedback on the self -study draft from the president , provost , and the deans at all the schools , and in September 20 22, the narrative was shared with the larger Tufts community for feedback. In fall 20 22, the Steering Committee collected final data for the Data First Forms , and the Tufts Board of Trustees approved the report at their November 20 22 meeting. xxviii The Tufts community achieved the initial goals for the self -study. The nine w orking groups embodied broad representation across the university community, and the ir passionate engagement throughout the process ensured a thorough, insightful, and transparent assessmen t of where Tufts is today and where the university aspires to be in the future. xxix Committee Membership NECHE Steering Committee Dawn Geron imo Terkl a Marty Ray Christina Butler Lisa Halpert Committee Co -Chair Committee Co -Chair Data First Forms Chair Standard 7 Chair Mike Howard Dan Jay Kevin Kraft Camille Lizarr \u00edbar Executive Vice Pres.

and student -centered, Tufts University is dedicated to academic rigor and interdisciplinary research that address the most critical issues facing our world. Rooted in the best traditions of learning and scholarship, Tufts is committed to educating tomorrow's leaders , across the world, in all disci plines and fields , through innovation in its teaching and research. At Tufts, creating excellence in education is forged through a philosophy that is forward -thinking, imaginative, and responsive to the fast -paced evolution of technology, politics, the sci ences, our global society, and the arts. Since our last accreditation, Tufts has maintained our very high research activity Carnegie classification (\"R1\") status and has been invited to membership in the Association of American Universities (AAU) . Since i ts founding in 1852 by members of the Universalist Church, Tufts has grown from a small liberal arts college into a nonsectarian university of approximately 12,000 students on four campuses. The largest division of the university is the Faculty of Arts, Sc iences, and Engineering (AS&E) . This division comprises the School of Arts and Sciences (A&S), the School of Engineering (SOE), the School of the Museum of Fine Arts (SMFA) , and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS). The university's graduate and professional schools are the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy (Fletcher), the School of Medicine (TUSM), the School of Dental Medicine (TUSDM), Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine (Cummings School ), the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of N utrition Science and Policy (Friedman), and the Tufts Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS). The university's newest schools are the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life (Tisch), the School of the Museum of Fine Arts (SMFA), and University College (UC). In 2006, thanks to extraordinary philanthropy from Jonathan Tisch, A76, the University College of Citizenship and Public Service was renamed the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citiz enship and Public Service. In 2016, the name was updated to the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life to better capture the nature of the college's work and the challenges ahead. In 2016, Tufts acquired SMFA , which was previously affiliated with Tufts but run by the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. With the acquisition of SMFA , its students have become a vibrant part of the Tufts community . SMFA is an outstanding art school with a long tradition of excellence go ing back more than 100 years. UC is the most recent school at Tuft s to be approved by the University Faculty Senate and the Board of Trustees, in 2018 (not to be confused with the school now named Tisch, mentioned above) . UC faculty membership comprise s faculty members with primary appointments in the other schools. UC supports students' education at multiple points in their journey, including pre -college programs, visiting students, professional adult learners, and lifelong learners. Tufts' schools are located on campuses in Medford/Somerville, Boston, and North Grafton, Massachusetts. Students may also study at the Tufts European Center, located in an 11th-century monastery in Talloires, France; Portland, Maine as part of the medica l school's Maine Track M.D. program; the Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Concord, MA (MCI -Concord, medium security) , as part of the Tufts University Prison Initiative of Tisch College (TUPIT) ; and Phoenix, Arizona , as part of the Doctor of Physical Therapy (D.P.T. ) program. Tufts is also affiliated with the New England Conservatory of Music, providing a five-year combined degree program for students who want to combine an intensive music program with a strong liberal arts curriculum. The last three accreditation self -studies began during presidential transition s, and this self -study is no different. President Monaco announced his intention to step down , and the Board of Trustees has appointed Dr. Sunil Kumar as Tufts' 1 4th president , to start July 1, 2023 . Tufts also has an interim provost, Dr. Caroline Attardo Genco, with a search for a permanent provost commencing at the new president 's discretion . This time of transition will be reflected in several of the standard narratives, xxxv especially Standards 1, 2, and 3. Under the leadership of a new president , the Tufts community is projected to undertake a new strategic plan, building on the current strate gic plan (Tufts The Next Ten Years (T10 Strategic Planning) implemented in 2013. Another exciting area of transition , which occurred in March 2022, is a strategic institutional alignment with Wellforce, the parent company of Tufts Medical Center. As part of this alignment , Wellforce changed its name to Tufts Medicine . The alignment endeavors to expand opportunities for clinical, basic science, and public health research ; to simplify the collaboration process between faculty and researchers ; and to provide TUSM studen ts with a new level of access to patients and community partners through the development of new clinical rotation programs at hospitals within the Tufts Medicine system and access to clinical settings for research and trials . Another important part of Tufts' current context is President Monaco's commitment to making Tufts an anti-racist institution. This comprehensive initiative was announced and launched in 2020. Over a period of eight months, more than 100 individuals \u2014faculty, staff, and students \u2014collaboratively identified over 180 recommendations to meet the Tufts community's goals in five separate workstreams that focused on different aspects of the academic and administrative enterprise. Each workstream had broad representation of faculty, staff, an d students across the university. The final reports and recommendations of each of the workstreams can be found in the following links: (1) Campus Safety and Policing , (2) Compositional Diversity , (3) Equity and Inclusion , (4) Institutional A udit and Targeted Actions , (5) Public Art . To lead the effort to ensure the 180+ recommendat ions are implemented, a director of anti -racist initiatives was hired through a national search. In addition, President Monaco and the university committed at least $25 million in university resources, over five years, to support the efforts and execute as many of the recommendations as possible. The actual commitments have since grown to exceed $50 million across the university. Since the launch of the initiative, and throughout the implementation process, t he Tufts as an Anti -Racist Institution initiative has permeated all aspects of university life. Finally, an overview of Tufts' recent and current state would be incomplete with out mention of the university's response to the COVID -19 pandemic. Similar to other universities, in response to the pandemic shutdown Tufts quickly moved to remote learning in March 2020 and continues to offer a mix of in-person, remote learning, and flex ible learning opportunities to its students. Major accomplishments include the establishment of COVID -19 surveillance testing sites on each campus with a robust contact - tracking system and the hiring of a University Infection Control Health Director in August 2020. Tufts is proud that the university generated a strong financial result in fiscal year (FY) 2021 despite the challenges of the COVID -19 pandemic and did not have to institute drastic cuts to employment for its faculty and staff during the early days of the pandemic. The 2023 self -study, written in President Anthony Monaco's penultimate year, demonstrates Tufts' significant successes made over the past 10 years as well as the challenges it has successfully surmounted or continues to face. The self -study has come at a t ime when the campus community is thinking of the future while also feeling the weight of the past several years of pandemic life. Major self - study themes, including ongoing work in diversity , equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) ; Tufts' identity as an ant i-racist institution; the COVID -19 response and changes; the university's current $1.5 billion capital campaign, Brighter World: The Campaign for Tufts ; and the infusion of new academic and residential spaces onto campuses, will likely become priorities in the next university -wide strategic plan. The upcoming years will prove to be another opportunity for improvement and discovery as Tufts conti nues on this trajector y. Tufts College and Tufts University: A Tale of Several Presidents By Sol Gittleman University Professo r xxxvi Similar to most of the higher education institutions in the U.S. in 1852, Tufts was founded by a religious order , the Universalist Church, for the exclusive education of its parishioners, children, and clergy. Universalism represented a unique Protestant tradition, and that difference permanently characterized Tufts. Therefore, it should be no surprise that the first four presidents of Tufts College were Universalist ministers . The genial Universalists preached universal salvation: the doctrine was inclusive, tolerant, and welcoming to all comers. Welcoming as they might have been, these clergy had little experience running an educational institution. In those early years, and well into the 20 th century, Tufts and its finances were unstable at best. However, along the way, the university added a medical school, a den tal school, and an engineering program, none of which had sufficient resources and all of which always had difficulty in gaining professional accreditation. When the Flexner Report on Medical Education appeared in 1910, it recommended that Tufts cease medi cal education. The college had staggered through the financial panics of 1873 and 1907, then the Depression of the 1930s, selling off land to survive. The undergraduate college, however, remained a congenial and accessible place for local students, many of whom commuted. The first non -clergy president , appointed in 1915, was Herman Carey Bumpus , who arrived with stellar qualifications, including the new Ph .D. degree, which he had earned from Clark University in 1891. Bumpus was a scientist, like earlier pre sidents at Johns Hopkins, Columbia, and Harvard, where new research initiatives were being pursued. However, Bumpus had difficulty implementing his broad vision , and after a short span o f only four years as Tufts president, he left for a research position at the University of Wisconsin. His successor, John Albert Cousens, who became president in 1919 and died in office in 1937, did make changes, but none that challenged the comfortable complacency of the little college on Walnut Hill. President Co usens took his lead from Harvard's Abbot Lawrence Lowell, who, in the wake of the Sacco -Vanzetti arrests, trial, and execution between 1920 and 1927, decided that the immigrant populations storming the gates to Harvard Yard were a threat to the institution . President Cousens presided over Tufts at a time when ethnic quotas became the unwritten law of New England higher education, Tufts included. The next two presidents carried the sleepy New England college with underachieving professional schools, enormou s financial problems, and little ambition into \"The Golden Age of Boston Higher Education.\" Both had roots in the University of Rochester, and both were ambitious academic psychologists with earned doctorates who wanted to move the institution beyond the v ision of a satisfied faculty and contented student body. Leonard Carmichael (1938 -1952) hoped to shake the Tufts community out of its tranquility, survived financial crises by eagerly embracing the Navy V -12 program that brought hundreds of new students an d their tuitions to the campus during WWII, and left in his mid -50s to pursue another career at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D .C. His handpicked successor, Nils Yngve Wessell, was determined to make Tufts more than it had been or wanted to be. He sought faculty with Ph .D.s, advocated research as part of the faculty's mission, changed the institutional name to Tufts University, and urged the faculty to begin doctoral programs. Without resources and fundraising, the programs were at best hollow and v iewed with suspicion by the accrediting agencies. In 1966 he resigned while still in his early 50s to become head of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. He had done what he could to break down the walls of parochialism: during his presidency, the first non -Harvard Ph .D. was hired in the English Department; he also saw the hiring of the English Department's first Catholic and Jew. The History Department appointed its first non - Protestant, a Greek Orthodox! But, as president of a fledgling university with only 20 new Ph .D. programs and a small library compared to other institutions , Wessell realized that he had gone as far as he could with a senior faculty reluctant to undertake research initiatives, who believed that there was a fundamental conflict betwee n teaching and research. Wessell could not afford to hire research faculty. He hoped that his successor might build on his accomplishments; but that was not to be. Tufts had found its ninth p resident in 1967. Burton Hallowell had come from Wesleyan Univer sity and looked forward to a productive tenure at Tufts. Instead, he inherited a budget deficit that left Tufts xxxvii financially crippled for the first years of his presidency . The social turmoil of the 1960s and 70s also took its toll . Burt Hallowell departed in 1975, barely 60 years old. He went on to a successful career managing the Keystone Funds. While h e left Tufts with a balanced budget, the institution still had few resources, no tradition of successful fundraising, and a self -study report that pointed t o five difficult years, followed by a decade of even greater peril for the institution. One education historian actually questioned Tufts' viability to survive. The college was accepting one out of every two applicants; the professional schools were underf unded. Tufts was in a downward spiral, and no one knew how to stop it. Nothing in Tufts history had prepared the community for the arrival of Jean Mayer. He was French - born, a graduate of the Sorbonne, got a Ph .D. in physiology from Yale, and became one of America's leading academic nutritionists, a field that was of little interest to mainstream medical doctors. Jean Mayer became the 10th president of Tufts University , and by the time he retired 16 years later in 1992, he had tr ansformed the institution. Mayer led two fundraising campaigns that raised $400 million, an unbelievable amount for a school with a history of not asking alumni for money. He also raised another $100 million of federal money for Tufts by going directly to the Congressional delegation. As a nutritionist, Mayer knew that the medical doctors and clinicians who ran the National Institutes of Health (NIH) study panels were not interested in wellness or prevention . Through deep and long advocacy , he successfully lobbied the Department of Agriculture to put $10 million in its budget for a nutrition center at Tufts University, without peer review. He got another $10 million for a veterinary school. While a ll the fear, anxiety, and timidity of the pre -Mayer years had disappeared , the civility remained, even with more research -oriented faculty. When Jean Mayer stepped down in 1992, he left the institution financially stable, with strong bond ratings, and an academic reputation as a superb small research u niversity with a powerful teaching mission. The 11 th Tufts president , John DiBiaggio, embraced the new fundraising capacity left to him by Jean Mayer and inaugurated one $450 million campaign that met its goals so quickly that it was raised to $600 millio n before he stepped down in 2001. Tufts had raised $1 billion in 25 years, a figure that would have left all previous Tufts presidents, boards of trustees, and alumni in total disbelief. When Lawrence Bacow became the 12th Tufts President in 2001, the university was ready for an explosion of academic achievement. Bacow spearheaded an effort that would transform the institution into one that had more universal excellence in research, interd isciplinary clustering of faculty interests, and the building of bridges within and across schools. He was aware, as well, that fundraising never stops, took on one enormous $1.2 billion campaign, and handed the university over to Anthony Monaco, the 13th President, in 2011. The years of the Monaco presidency (2011 -2023), while attaining recognition for its research accomplishments, has left Tufts an institution true to its nature: a teaching university where research is important \u2014but not exclusively. The number of Ph.D. degrees awarded annually during that period averaged 135, well below the number of doctorates granted by most of the American research universities that are members of the Association of American Universities (AAU) . A goal of the previous four presidents, Tufts was invited to join the AAU in 2021. Founded in 1900, membership to AAU is by invitation only and requires an affirmative vote of three -quarters of current members. The other major accomplishment of the Monaco presidency was the extr aordinary response to the COVID -19 crisis, which brought an unprecedented level of testing, quarantining, and related programs that supported thousands of Tufts undergraduates on the Medford campus, attending classes in person whenever possible. Many insti tutions were forced to shut their doors; Tufts continued to teach on all of its campuses. The Monaco presidency also saw the successful completion of a $1.5 billion campaign. President Monaco announced that 2023 would be his last year, and in fall 2022 Tu fts announced that Dr. Sunil Kumar would succeed Dr. Monaco as president on July 1, 2023. xxxviii Tufts was also caught up in many of the social and political issues that roiled college campuses during the decade since the last accreditation: institutional issues related to race, the teaching of history, the politicization of the curriculum, conformity, xenophobia, anti semitism. Tufts was touched by every aspect that affected higher education in a time of an xiety, stress, and public disaffection with our academic institutions. The past 45 years have produced the metamorphosis of Tufts. Led by its most recent five presidents, Tufts has achieved an excellence unlike that of the traditional American research u niversity. Tufts, while ardently pursuing a research agenda for all its schools, has remained true to its teaching mission at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. We are, in every sense, a teaching university where everyone does research. Sol Gittleman was provost of Tufts University from 1981 to 2002 and is currently the Alice and Nathan Gantcher University Professor emeritus. He is a legend at Tufts University, whose association with the university dates almost 60 years to 1964. He is well known within the community for his storytelling skills, dynamic presentations, encyclopedic knowledge, and caring mentorship of generations of students, faculty, and staff. His deep passion for baseball (he once tried out for the minor leagues) led him to author books on the sport and teach a perennially popular class entitled \"America and the National Pastime.\" Tufts announced in 2022 that its new baseball ballpark will be named in his honor and will be known as \" Sol Gittleman Pa rk.\" 1 Standard 1: Mission and Purposes DESCRIPTION For more than 140 years, Tufts University operated without a formal mission statement. The first mission statement was adopted by the Board of Trustees in 1994 and was reflected in the last NEASC accredita tion self -study in 2013. In 2013, the university underwent a comprehensive, university -wide strategic planning process to develop what became known as \"Tufts The Next Ten Years\" (T10) . As part of the strategic planning process, the university developed a clear message regarding its values and identity as an institution and outlined its value proposition. This led to a revised vision statement and a new mission statement. The T10 strategic plan was approved by the Tufts Board of Trustees in November 2013. What is Tufts University? Tufts is an inclusive, student -centered community devoted to excellence in creating, preserving, disseminating, and applying knowledge and ideas. We are committed to deep intellectual and artistic engagement that inspires all in our community to pursue a l ifetime of learning. We encourage intellectual curiosity, facilitate sustained critical thinking, and believe that dedication to the rigors of intellectual inquiry and creative achievement will result in a profound impact on the challenges that society wil l encounter over the next decade. Tufts' signature approach to higher education stems from the belief that seemingly disparate forces can, and must, work together if we are to reach our full potential. This belief is perhaps best exemplified by Tufts' un usual, yet highly successful, positioning of itself as a blend of both a rising R1 research university with a thriving undergraduate college experience steeped in the liberal arts tradition, a unique combination that attracts students, faculty, and staff w ho flourish in our environment of curiosity, creativity, and engagement. Tufts' Value Proposition Creating and sustaining an environment that prepares to launch all our students into the world to chart a course for success requires effective stewardship of our resources during a time of significant challenges in higher education. Operational costs and financial aid needs are rising, while research funding, philanthropy, and returns on endowments remain uncertain. New and changing regulations, compliance r equirements, and standards of assessment are appearing alongside rapidly evolving digital technologies that will push the boundaries of, and reinvent the methodologies for, how we teach, learn, and conduct research. Tufts will remain strong, in part because it has a range of schools with distinct missions that all share the same unifying foundational values. Key to continued success will be sustained efforts in deepening connections across the university and enhancing collaborations both within the institution and with other leading institutions in the Boston area and around the world who complement all that Tufts has to offer. The blend of depth in traditional disciplines, novel interdisciplinary programs, and commitm ent to active citizenship and public service is what creates the unique potential of our student -centered research university. Tufts will continue to balance its commitments to teaching and research to ensure a cohesive and communal student -centered experi ence that maximizes the value of a Tufts education and ensures lifelong engagement. We will pursue innovations in online and digital learning that enhance our educational goals and remain consistent with our values and strengths. We will fortify and deepen existing research programs and initiatives, while working to overcome administrative and cultural obstacles to effectively engage in interdisciplinary and cross -school partnerships and collaborations. In short, we will continue to build on the tremendous accomplishments and potential that people associate with the name Tufts. 2 VISION: To be an innovative university of creative scholars across a broad range of schools who have a profound impact on one another and the world. MISSION: Tufts is a student -centered research university dedicated to the creation and application of knowledge. We are committed to providing transformational experiences for students and faculty in an inclusive and collaborative environment where creative scholars generate bold ideas, innovate in the face of complex challenges, and distinguish themselves as active citizens of the world. (Each of the schools within Tufts set their own individual missions consistent with the university's mission, vision, and values.) APPRAISAL The strat egic plan was very well received when it was approved by the Board of Trustees , and the new mission and vision statements were shared with the larger community. Over the years certain deficiencies have been noted in how these statements did not adequately address key aspects of the Tufts community. First was Tufts' identity as an institution that embodies civic and public service as a key tenet of its mission. The Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life, established in 2000 and renamed to its current form i n 2016, truly established itself over the past decade as a national leader in civic education and engagement that sets the standard for higher education's role in advancing the greater good. The mission statement needs to acknowledge the major role that Ti sch College plays in all aspects of the Tufts experience, beyond a passive mention of Tufts students as \"active citizens. \" A second deficiency within the mission statement was a failure to acknowledge diversity as a key institutional priority. While the mission statement hinted at inclusiveness, it missed out on including diversity, equity, inclusion , belonging , and justice as key institutional goals. In the years since the development of the mission , the community has expected more from university administration on these important issues. As discussed in the institutional overview, in 2020, President Anthony P. Monaco announced a comprehensive initiative called Tufts as an Anti -Racist Institution. At least $25 million in university resources, over five years, have been committed to supporting the implementation of recommendations from the community, which is currently underway. Additional efforts to address other important issues of discrimination an d bias have been introduced. An initiative to combat the rise of antisemitism on campus was launched, and opportunities for change on campus were identified. The university established a new resource center for native and indigenous community members, offe red programming in support of the Asian community amidst the COVID -19 pandemic, and increased resources to first -generation students and other members of the BIPOC and LGBTQ communities. The university's commitment to the principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging , and justice remains strong. Tufts alumni have responded strongly to this commitment , as evidenced by the recent successes of the Brighter World capital campaign , which has raised $1. 34 billion dollars of its $1. 5 billion goal, includin g over $ 300 million for financial aid (as of June 1, 2022). PROJECTION Tufts is in a transition phase ; the current president has announced that he will step down during the summer of 2023. We project that a new president will launch a new strategic planning process involving the entire community to refresh and accurately reflect the mission, vision, and goals of the university. At this time, we anticipate that some of the gaps in the current mission statement will be addressed. The emergence of new programs and instructional modalities, including remote learning and flex learning during the COVID -19 pandemic, will require the university to employ strategies to better understand what it can offer to students and potential applicants, the institution's position within the marketplace of higher education, and innovative ways to recruit and retain talented faculty and staff to support the educational and research mission in a rapidly changing world. 3 Standard 2: Planning and Evaluation DESCRIPTION Introduction Tufts operates under a confederated governance model , with planning, decisions, and evaluations made at the lowest appropriat e organizational level. Planning and evaluation are shared responsibilities of the president, provost, administrative leadership, and deans. The Board of Trustees provides oversight to the university , and the Boards of Advisors support the schools in an ad visory capacity. Continuous improvement occurs through regular assessment. The provost and the academic and administrative councils ensure that decisions are acted upon at the central and local levels.1 PLANNING: DESCRIPTION AND APPRAISAL Strategic Planning Since 2013, many of the university's major initiatives have been guided by Tufts' strategic plan, \"Tufts The Next Ten Years\" (T10) . The plan's four strategic themes have been the underpinning for many of the transformational initiatives successfully undertaken over the last nine years. These have included enhanced undergraduate and graduate financial aid; the implementation of diversity and inclusion recommendations and the creation of the office of the chief diversity office r; investments in emerging research areas; and creation of physical spaces aligned with strategic initiatives and sustainability goals. Fueling many of the strategic initiatives under the plan is the success of the university's $1.5 billion capital campaign, Brighter World: The Campaign for Tufts , which was launched in 2017 and is expected to reach or exceed the fundraising goal in FY 2023. In addition to the university's overarching strategic plan, individual schools have developed strategic plans to guide their own goals, particularly to advance the academic mission and priorities unique to their discipline(s). Under the responsibility center management (RCM) model, the foundation of academic and resource planning traditionally exists within schoo ls, with support and guidance from the central level. Tufts is also effective at university -wide planning efforts to address emerging threats and opportunities. In the last 10 years, Tufts has evolved to think more strategically and execute plans as one un iversity with broad participation from its community , which will especially be important during the presidential transition. Response to COVID -19 While planning often focuses on intermediate and long -term goals, Tufts has been able to plan effectively to meet immediate critical needs and challenges. This ability is evident in the university's remarkable success managing the COVID -19 pandemic with an eye to meeting the needs of students and maintaining academic priorities. When the pandemic hit in March 202 0, initial planning committees were formed to address campus safety and determine how best to continue the delivery of academic programs. Major accomplishments included the establishment of COVID -19 surveillance testing sites on each campus with a robust c ontact -tracking system; the mobilization of several dozen modular housing units to support students in isolation or quarantine; and effective polic ies related to overall campus density, social distancing, and other safety precautions such as increased st erilization of community spaces. In addition, each school quickly shifted to fully remote or hybrid teaching, which ensured the continuity of the academic programs that students needed to progress on schedule. These initial planning groups evolved into a single COVID Coordinating Committee (CCC), which is now the decision -making body monitoring the ongoing impact of COVID -19. The CCC continues to meet weekly and actively monitors the COVID -19 positivity rate at each campus and in the surrounding communitie s, the number of students in isolation or quarantine, and the vaccination status of students, faculty, and staff. An important outcome of the response to the COVID -19 pandemic was the hiring of a 1 See Standard 3 for more information about governing councils. 4 University Infection Control Health Director in August 2020 to spearhead the university's efforts and provide leadership and expertise to the CCC. Tufts as an Anti -Racist Institution The university's commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice has progressed through a steady increase of staff, resources, and programming since its identification as a k ey priority in the T10 strategic plan. On July 8, 2020, President Monaco announced the Tufts as an Anti -Racist Institution initiative , which pledges to audit, investigate, and provide recommendations \"to find and eradicate any structural racism at Tufts and to take the steps necessary to become what every member of our community would view as an anti -racist institutio n.\" The Anti -racism Oversight Committee (AOC) was created as the governance structure to oversee the effort. Transparent accountability and reporting measures to periodically inform the community on implementation progress and on how the funds have been al located will be developed. Addressing Mental Health Needs of Students At Tufts, the well -being of the university's students \u2014fundamental to both academic success and personal growth \u2014is of the utmost importance. In line with national trends, Tufts saw a significant increase in the demand for mental health services by students across all schools. In response to this escala ting demand and evolving student needs, in December 2016 the Task Force on Student Mental Health began a comprehensive assessment of student mental healt h. The goal was to develop actionable, evidence -based recommendations that would help the university better meet the mental health needs of students. The Task Force was co -chaired by President Monaco and Dr. Paul Summergrad, who serve s as the chair of the Department of Psychiatry at TUSM . The full Task Force was complemented by an Undergraduate Working Group, a Graduate and Professional Working Group, and a Models of Care Group focused on clinical services available on the Medford/Somerville and Boston SMFA campuses. The working groups allowed a broader range of stakeholders to participate in the work of the Task Force. To support this work , the Task Force and working groups relied on quantitative data sources on Tufts stude nts, including the healthy minds study , the American College Health Association National College Health Asses sment, insurance utilization data, and data from on -campus services and resources. The Task Force on Student Mental Health shared a report of its finding s and recommendations with the Tufts University community in October 2019. In 2020, President Monaco convened a standing Student Mental Health Steering Committee designed as an ongoing structure to continue the work star ted by the Task Force on Student Mental Health. This committee meets two to four times a year to discuss mental health issues of concern and ways to create change. A subgroup of the Task Force has been formed to examine mental health resources available to the university's online students and ensure that they receive care equivalent to that of in -person students. Academic Planning The Deans ' Council convenes regularly and comprises the deans of all the schools and the provost. Deans ' Council meetings are led by Provost Genco and are designed to take a strategic approach to academic planning, including discussing and establishing strategic priorities, identifying synergies and areas of collaboration across schools, and determining key performance indicators. In fall 2017, the university formed the Program Development and Approval Commi ttee (PDAC) to develop and facilitate the implementation of new guidelines for schools when proposing new academic programs. PDAC is a partnership between the Office of the Provost and the Office of Strategy and Program Development (reporting to the executive vice president) to support the strategic development of new programs and to help schools through the approval process. The PDAC process is designed to start at a program's inception and is meant to be collaborative. Through robust market research and consultative, smart program design, this committee ensures from an early stage that programs will 5 attract students and be self -sustaining. PDAC also guides schools through the necessary processes for program discontinuanc e. In the four years since the creation of PDAC, more than 39 degree and certificate programs have been approved, and many have launched , as seen below . Collectively, these programs have already become critical contributors to school graduate degree and certificate (GDC) portfolios . New programs represent : o Six percent of GDC applications (FY 2021 as of April 2021) o Ten of GDC enrollments (FY 2021 as of April 2021) o Five percent of GDC budgeted net revenue (FY 2026) New programs are expected to significantly outperform the existing portfoli o: Category New Existing Application Physical Therapy ( D.P.T. ) program was one of the first programs to be developed through the PDAC process in 2017. The program was designed as an innovative two -year accelerated hybrid model and enrolled its first cohort in January 2021. Supported by market research, additional D.P.T. programs are being developed as part of a regional expansion strategy, beginning with the Phoenix, Arizona , program that launched in June 2022. In fall 2018, the trustees voted to approve the faculty bylaws for University College (UC) , a school focused on expanding access to a Tufts education to new audiences and through new types of educational programming. Recognizing that Tufts must evolve to meet the changing needs of society, Tufts evaluated nontraditional learning spaces, operating models, and cross -school programming for 6 near-term and aspirational resonance with Tufts' mission and resources. UC was established with an innovative structure meant to achieve success in the Tufts -specific context: an independent school reporting to the provost where many of its programs would be developed in partnership with other Tufts schools. Thro ugh this model, UC is the expert in designing programming for and reaching new kinds of learners , while its partner schools bring their expertise in content and pedagogy. The successes it has achieved have been predicated on excellent academic and student experiences, rooted in robust market research, ongoing analytical and feedback cycles, and extensive cross -university and cross - functional planning processes. Although still in its infancy, UC has made significant headway in achieving its initial launch go als. Today, all of UC's approximately 5 ,000 students are nondegree learners, a student group that is critical to building a broad -based, diverse, sustainable learning community for Tufts in today's continual, stackable education environment. Through ongo ing communication and strategic new program development, UC hopes to help these students find the next Tufts certificate, degree, or course needed to meet their professional or intellectual goals. Tufts has made tremendous strides under the T10 strateg ic plan in increasing data science research and education. The Data Intensive Study Center (DISC) was created to engage faculty and students across Tufts and to exploit opportunities in data science to better support research and educational goals. In the spring of 2019, Dr. Abani Patra was appointed the first direct or of DISC . The S OE launched new degree and certificate programs in data science, the Bachelor of Science in Data Science , followed by a Master of Science in Data Science , a Graduate Certificat e in Data Science , and an Online Master of Science in Data Science in the fall of 2021. These programs enco mpass principles and practices that support real -world problem -solving through data analysis and will give students experience with data analysis techniques, including statistics, data visualization, and machine learning. Another major initiative is the Tufts Center for Transdisciplinary Research in Principles of Data Science (T-TRIPODS) , which was created in October 2019 through the award of a $1.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) . As described in the institutional overview, Tufts acquired S MFA after an intensive period of due diligence and planning. From September to December 2015, A&S , in partnership with the Office o f Business Development (now named the Office of Strategy and Program Development) , engaged cross - functional working groups to study critical elements of SMFA's academic and business operations, to assess its fit with Tufts' mission, strategic plan, and way s of working, and ultimately to build a narrative for the desirability of the acquisition. The acquisition team reported regularly to Tufts' senior leadership team and to the trustees before and throughout the negotiations with the Museum of Fine Arts, ensuring the best possible outcome for Tufts ' and SMFA's students in the process. Once finalized, an extensive and cross -functional implementation team was established to complete the detailed and challenging integration process, including establishing a prac tice of ongoing review of critical assumptions and feedback that has been essential to the success of the acquisition. Supporting Research In January 2017, Tufts launched a university -wide research and scholarship strategic planning effort through the Office of the Vice Provost for Research (OVPR) to build upon current strengths, identify new opportunities, and chart a path forward as an innovative, civically engaged, student -centered, tier - one research university. The planning effort was g uided by a 24 -member steering committee of faculty, students, staff, and postdoctoral fellows and included extensive input from internal and external stakeholders. These efforts resulted in the Tufts University Research and Scholarship Strategic Plan (RSSP) . The RSSP is focused on addressing \"grand challenges\" that Tufts is well positioned to address through existing strengths, academic unit s, and infrastructure. Five thematic priority areas were identified in which working groups would be formed to develop specific proposals highlighting new collaborative research and scholarship efforts. These thematic priority areas are: (1) climate, food, water, and energy ; (2) comparative global humanities ; (3) equitable society ; (4) living technology ; and (5) One Health (the interrelated health of humans, animals, and the environment). Eight specific proposals were selected for one to three years of fund ing. The aim of this funding is to launch sustainable research efforts in these areas to attract significant external funding , with operational 7 support provided by OVPR . Significant progress has been made and can be found in the RSSP progress reports . One specific proposal addresses the rise and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which is ranked among the World Health Organization's ( WHO ) top 10 threats to global health. Given the importance of this topic and Tufts ' potential to make an impact in the field, the three -year funding of $750,000 provided by the university was matched by Tufts Medical Center, the primary teaching hospital of TUSM. Additionally, b uilding upon Tufts' expertise in One Health, the university was chosen by the U.S. Agency for International Development in September 2020 to lead a $100 million, five -year program called Strategies to Prevent Spillover ( STOP Spillover ). The selected priority areas of the RSSP are showing suc cess, with new research awards totaling $60 million over five years that will contribute critical solutions to reduce food loss and waste. This includes a $25 million award , with an additional $15 million in potential funding, to Tufts University to lead t he Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Food Systems for Nutrition . This Innovation Lab builds o n 10 years of leadership at the Friedman School that developed a robust evidence base on systems -level approaches to inform food systems transformation. Administrative Planning Administrativ e planning at both the university and school levels directly supports the advancement of the academic mission. Planning in the areas of finances, human resources (HR) , facilities and infrastructure, fundraising, information technology, and administrative a reas are aligned and resourced to meet academic goals. The Office of Strategy and Program Development, reporting to the executive vice president, partners with the Office of the Provost and each of the schools to identify and develop m ission -related opportunities that will transform the university's model for sustainable success in the 21st century higher education ecosyste m. Key initiatives include: Market research and analysis to support the development and evaluation of academic programs Program portfolio reviews of each school's educational programs ; Quarterly strategy sessions with each school and the provost's office to discuss broad strategic goals, their program development pipeline, and market research needs ; PDAC ; Strategic initiative and planning process support for university -wide or high -priority initiatives . Consistent with the T10 strategic plan goal to create physical spaces with strategic initiatives and sustainability goals in mind, the last five years have seen many transformational projects designed to advance the academic mission and improve the experie nce for student, faculty, and staff. During this time, Tufts invested over $450 million in recently completed and ongoing capital construction projects that are transformative to our campuses and academic programs. One of the most significant projects recently completed was the construction of the Joyce Cummings Center (JCC) , a six -story multidisciplinary building that will bring together the Departments of Computer Science , Economics , and Mathematics , as well as the Center for Applied Brain and Cognitive Studies. The building will also be home to the Fletcher School executive education program and university -wide, interdisciplinary centers , including the Gordon Institute (TGI) , the Derby Entrepreneurship Center at Tufts, the Data Intensive Studies Center (DISC) , and the Tufts Institute for Artificial Intelligence (TIAI). The most efficient building on the Medford/Somerville campus as of 2021, the JCC was designed with a low energy -use intensity target and incorporates a number of sustainability features with the goal of reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Tufts has developed a long -range capital renewal plan with a strategic allocation method to address deferred maintenance. The capital renewal p lanning process utilizes a strategy that does not target the same facility condition for every building, but rather classifies buildings based on required level of care 8 and typology. This allows for buildings of lower academic priority or utilization to re ceive less investment, freeing up more funding for assets of strategic importance to the schools. Sustainabilitycontinues to be an important priority for Tufts. TheOffice of Sustainability (OOS) serves as a major resource and driver ofsustainabilityefforts across the campuses, and works in collaboration with the Operations Division and other academic and administrative departments. Areas of focus include decarbonization, climate change mitigation and planning, sustainable transportation, waste reduction and diversion, data tracking and reporting, and education and advocacy. This work also supports the academic mission with efforts to integratesustainabil ityissues into research, scholarship, andstudent life. The creation of the Green Fund in 2018 allows students, faculty, and staff to implement their own sustainability projects on the campuses. Efforts to advance the university's commitment to becoming carbon neutral no later than 2050 include the construction of a more efficient Central Energy Plant (CEP), the construction and renovation of sustainable buildings , and the creation of responsible investment goals , among others. Tufts also received the Cas ella Sustainability Leadership Award in 2022 in recognition of campus waste reduction and education efforts. Tufts underwent a peer review in October 2020 to further evaluate the effectiveness of itssustainabilityprograms. The review recommended better a ligningsustainabilityefforts across departments and disciplines to maximize impact. These recommendations are being considered by the Tufts Sustainability Council, made up of faculty experts, as they create a new university -wide sustainability action pla n to be finalized in 2023. To monitor the success of the university's sustainability efforts, OOS publishes annual progress reports that include a report card detailing Tufts greenhouse gas emissions, energy usage, and waste data. The COVID -19 pandemic forced Tufts faculty and staff to abruptly transition to remote working in March 2020. Over the course of the following year, many advantages to a fully remote or hybrid work arrangement were identified for employees and the universit y. This resulted in new policies and flexible work options for many faculty and staff. A Flexible Work at Tufts Committee was established to refine the university's policies to ensure that remote and hybrid arrangements are applied equitably among employee categories, and that a dequate resources will be available to ensure employees are successful in their work to advance Tufts' academic mission. Another major goal in the pursuit of more flexible work options is to enable Tufts to become an employer of choice in the higher educa tion job market. Tufts operates in a very competitive region , with dozens of colleges and universities vying for talented faculty and staff. The Human Resources Division routinely evaluates job categories to ensure salaries and overall benefits are competi tive with local and regional peer institutions. For FY 2023, Tufts changed its health insurance carrier from a regional provider to Blue Cross Blue Shield in order to offer the broadest national network. This was critical , as the university is hiring more faculty and staff located outside the New England region to support its growing online and hybrid educational programs. Going forward , Tufts will need to continue to evaluate its salaries and benefits to attract the workforce that will enable it to achieve its ambitious strategic goals. While the university managed to operate successfully during the COVID -19 pandemic, several risks and unnecessary complexities became apparent related to occupational health. To address these concerns and to get a complete e valuation of its strengths and weaknesses in this area, Tufts launched a year-long needs assessment conducted by the Occupational & Environmental Health Network (OEHN), a leading national firm specializing in occupational and environmental medicine. The study involved more than 80 stakeholders from all campuses and revealed the need to establish streamlined and comprehensive occupational health services to serve the needs of faculty, staff, and postdoctoral scholars in all areas of the unive rsity, including research. As a result of this evaluation, on -site, university -wide occupational health services (OHS) will be created to promote safety in the workplace, provide convenient access to services such as vaccinations, medical clearances, and t reatment of work -related injuries and illnesses, and to further support the research enterprise. An OHS office opened in January 2022 on the Medford/Somerville campus, followed by a location on the Boston 9 Health Sciences campus in summer 2022, and the ex pansion of existing services on the Grafton campus in 2023. Budget and Finance The university undergoes extensive five -year operating budget efforts in which all schools, colleges , and administrative divisions participate. Deans and their executive associate deans (EADs) retain authority and accountability for the financial health of their school, including the development and execution of multiyear plans and balanced budgets, with support for budget development, forecasting , and analysis by the Budget Ce nter. In FY 2018, the Budget Center, in collaboration with the Office of the Vice Provost for Research (OVPR), started the roll -out of a grant planning module in the budget system to support the forecasting and monitoring of grant spending. An important el ement of the budget process is a meeting between the provost, individual school deans and school leadership, and budget and planning personnel to review academic and strategic priorities to ensure annual and five -year budget s are aligned to achieve Tufts' goals. The university budget is monitored extensively. During the fiscal year, periodic forecasts are prepared by the Budget Center in consultation with each department, school , and division. Significant changes from budget are identified , as are plans to manage within available resources. Financial management has long been a strength at Tufts, which was essential in enabling the university to advance its mission and generate a s trong financial result in FY 2021 despite the challenges of the COVID -19 pandemic. Based on its strong financial footing, the university issued $250 million in taxable bonds in 2021 to fund its many strategic priorities. The priorities include expanding ho using and dining for undergraduate students, reimagining the Medford/Somerville academic campus, and achieving carbon reduction goals. Investments will continue to fund the highest strategic priorities , including undergraduate and graduate financial aid; d iversity equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) initiatives, and environmental sustainability. EVALUATION: DESCRIPTION AND APPRAISAL Institutional Research The Office of Institutional Research (OIR) serves as a resource for the Tufts community and is invol ved extensively in university assessment and evaluation efforts. In conjunction with the trustees and the Offices of the President and Provost, OIR develops, collects, organizes, monitors , and maintains university - and school -level strategic indicators. So me examples of this work include the Deans' Data Hub, Trustees Academic Affairs Committee (TAAC) reports, and the Diversity Dashboard . OIR a lso developed the Department Data Hub, a series of dashboards to AS&E departments with program review efforts. This data hub also serves as a critical resource as AS&E departments implement and assess their DEIJ initiatives. Additionally, OIR responds to requests from departments, programs, and the professional schools to provide outcomes assessments. OIR designs and administers survey instruments, collects relevant data, analyzes results, and generates reports for primary stakeholders. These e fforts provide a system of continual assessment of academic and administrative effectiveness. To understand more about students' opinions, attitudes, choices, and preferences, OIR annually administers surveys to matriculating and nonmatriculating accepted applicants. Survey results have prompted changes in admissions outreach to attract and enroll a diverse and talented student body. Moreover, exit surveys are administered annually to students upon graduation , and these data are used by service centers, facilities, deans, and department and program chairs to inform decisions or make improvements in their areas. For example, Cummings School regularly reviews exit survey results to improve the curriculum, student services, and their facilities. OIR analyses an d reports also provide satisfaction data in key areas such as student services, learning outcomes, and curriculum and courses. OIR evaluates its work through direct customer feedback and reflection on the efficacy of prior projects. More robust analytica l support has been identified as a need across the university, and as a result two new Research Analyst positions have been approved by the provost as a first step towards making 10 progress in this area. OIR takes an active role in assessment, and its staff participates in school -based outcomes assessment committees (OACs). Schools and programs with professional accreditation have developed systems for continued assessment and improvement of academic programs, faculty, and student services. Department and P rogram Reviews Reviews of academic departments or programs are routinely conducted in each of the schools. A significant number of programs across Tufts undergo a rigorous, continuous review through accreditation by discipline -specific agencies . Those programs not subject to discipline -specific accreditation are reviewed internally at regular intervals as defined by each school, often with the assistance of external reviewers. The following is a brief description of the review process at several of our schools. A&S academic departments and programs are routinely evaluated to ensure that scholarship and pedagogical goals are achieved. Based on an internal assessment of need and priority, up to four departments or programs are chosen for review each year . The academic deans coordinate the reviews that begin with a self -study based on perceived strengths in scholarship and teaching, opportunities for growth, and priorities for future hires. The reviews provide valuable perspective about strengths, weaknesses, an d opportunities , as well as a road map for future curriculum development, research, and potential hires. Fletcher implemented a three -year operational plan to include a review of all its degree programs. Program reviews are led by a working group (faculty and staff) , with engagement of external reviewers and focus groups with stakeholders (alumni, students, faculty, staff, and Board of Advisors). Curricular changes are reviewed and voted on by the school's academic council and the full faculty. GSBS condu cts reviews of all doctoral programs every five years. The Committee on Programs and Faculty conducts reviews and makes recommendations to the GSBS Executive Council. Each program is required to prepare detailed information about strengths and weaknesses, immediate and long -term plans and goals, and implemented recommendations from the previous review. In 2017, the dean initiated an outside review of the school to evaluate whether its programs were meeting the needs of its students. This review led to sever al new initiatives to provide experiences across all programs that will prepare students for career excellence regardless of their choice of industries. Within TUSM, reviews conducted over the last five years have led to program closures , including the M.S. in Pain Research , Education , and Policy, M .S. in Health Communications , and the M.S. in Development and Regulation of Medicines and Devices . These programs were closed primarily due to chronic low enrollment. In 2020, an external review was conducted of the joint M .D./M.B.A. program Tufts offers with the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University. This review identified challenges with the four -year format based on the evolving M .D. program curriculum, and a working group has been created to explore new models , including a five -year option. Tisch implemented its most recent strategic plan in 2016 and underwent an external review in 2019. With the arrival of a new dean, the college will be embarking on a new strategi c planning process in 2022. This endeavor will be facilitated by the addition of two new positions: associate dean for strategic initiatives and a senior researcher for evaluation , who will oversee the implementation and measurement respectively to ensure evidence -based allocation of resources in the future. The ongoing review of educational programs conducted primarily within individual schools and departments has been effective , but this system could result in varying standards app lied to program evaluation across Tufts schools. In 2022, the Office of the Provost and the Office of Strategy and Program Development collaborated to explore the extent to which there should be a more substantive and formalized ongoing evaluation and re view of educational programs at the school and university levels ; that work is now beginning. The two offices are also working to create a more formal process for 11 the recommendation of program discontinuance, along with the policies and processes that woul d support such a recommendation. Annual Reports Each school submits an annual report to the Office of the Provost describing the prior year's achievements and future plans to advance local and institutional priorities. Some schools use these as communicat ion vehicles with alumni, faculty , and staff. A synthesized document is presented annually to the trustees. Risk Register As endorsed by the Trustee Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee and the president, the University Risk Management Committee (URMC) is responsible for providing oversight, guidance, and coordination of university -wide efforts aimed at identifying, assessing , managing , and mitigating risks that may adversely impact the assets, operations, academic and research reputations, and legal interests of the university or jeopardize life and safety of individuals. In fulfilling its oversight responsibility, the URMC a ssists Tufts' senior administrators who have primary or shared responsibility in managing risks within their assigned areas, with regards to establishing and monitoring risk mitigation strategies and ensuring sufficient organizational support. Further, the URMC advises the president , the senior team, and the Trustee Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee concerning strategic risks to the institution, as well as potentially high -impact operating risks. A \"risk register\" and \"heat map\" are used to identify, ran k, and manage risks across all campuses and are periodically updated by the URMC. PROJECTIONS Tufts University will continue to improve its planning and evaluation processes , building upon its commitment to a data -driven approach. With the T10 strategic p lan hitting the 10-year mark in 2023, the university is projected to once again engage its community , under the leadership of a new president, in a new strategic planning effort to guide Tufts ' future academic and administrative priorities. This planning w ill guide resource utilization, areas requiring major investments, and necessary organizational changes to accomplish its goals. A Financial Model Review Committee was formed in the summer 2021 to provide transparency in the alignment of schools' use of central services , with the allocation of those costs. The expected outcome of this work will be a fostering of increased collaboration across schools and units, increased budge t accountability, and support of long -term strategic planning and investments, particularly for university - wide priorities. Extensive planning efforts are underway to better integrate and align educational and research efforts between Tufts University and Tufts Medicine. Th e goal of this initiative will be to greatly expand research by creating alignment and a critical mass of translationally focused biomedical research across both institutions. It will also create new educational opportunities in various health profession disciplines. These plans will be transformational and strengthen Tufts' p osition as an R1 university while creating greater educational opportunities for students looking to address the challenges within our society and health system. The use of data for planning, decision making, and the evaluation of outcomes of strategic i nitiatives will become more uniform across the university. Tufts ' use of Tableau as an analytics platform to visualize data into dashboards will also enhance the principles of transparency and accountability. The university is currently engaged in an ini tiative to implement and automate a unified spatial data model, database , and planning application and process supported by geographic information system (GIS) technology. This initiative will empower our campus es' planning function with enhanced visibilit y into current, past , and prospective spatial dimension, occupancy , and use data. This initiative will significantly augment our ability to assess and optimize plans, options , and costs associated with 12 proposed capital programs, potential uses for space, and availability of spaces for academic and event scheduling . It will even optimize our facilities maintenance plans and strategies. 13 STANDARD 3: ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNANCE DESCRIPTION Governing Board Tufts College was chartered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1852. The legal corporate name is \"Trustees of Tufts College.\" The management and execution of business affairs are conducted under the auspices of the trustees , whose powers and duties are set forth in the bylaws . The board is responsible for the institution's quality and inte grity, holds its property and assets in trust, and has the authority to achieve institutional purposes by periodically reviewing and approving the university's mission and purposes. The board has final authority and responsibility for all policy and strate gy for the entire university and its subsidiaries. The board appoints and conducts an annual appraisal of the president. The board consists of no more than 41 members \u2014up to 30 board -elected charter trustees and 10 alumni trustees elected by and from the alumni \u2014and generally operates at or near that number. Each trustee is elected for a five -year term, may serve a maximum of two consecutive terms, and may then be reelected after a one -year hiatus. The chair, vice chairs, and members of standing committees and subcommittees are elected annually, serving for one year or until successors are elected. The chair and vice chairs and any trustees serving as a fundraising campaign co -chair may be reelected for one -year terms without hiatus. The Committee on Trusteeship reviews the board's composition annually to ensure that it reflects the backgrounds and expertise needed to govern Tufts. New trustees are or iented and mentored to ensure that they understand, accept, and fulfill responsibilities as fiduciaries, acting honestly and in good faith to realize Tufts' mission and purposes. All trustees and voting committee members complete a conflict -of-interest statement annually. Potential conflicts are reported to the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee and the university's external auditing firm. Except for the president, no trustee receives financial remuneration for service. The board meets at least three times each year, the Executive Committee approximately five times, and other committees meet periodically on a set schedule and as needed. The Executive Committee acts on behalf of the board between meetings. Each board meeting includes an executive session without the president and staff and another with the president but without senior officers, to provide for frank discussion. So that all trustees are informed on a wide range of issues , each committee chair reports regularly to the full board. Memb ers of the administration report regularly with the committee chair to appropriate committees. At most board meetings, administrators are regularly invited to make presentations at plenary sessions. The university also benefits from the perspectives of no n-fiduciary groups. The Board of Trustees oversees the Boards of Advisors , a group of 10 volunteer boards that advise, assist, and act as ambassadors for the scho ol, department, or program to which its appointment relates. The Boards of Advisors report directly to the provost and are coordinated by the Council of the Boards of Advisors, which generally includes each board chair and the school dean s or program director s. Many trustees and former trustees are advisors. Through the Council of the Boards of Advisors, the trustees' Executive Committee approves or is notified of all advisors' membership and approves all minutes of advisors' meetings. 14 Ongoing fundraising campaigns include a steering committee and subsidiary advisory groups to guide and support major fundraising initiatives. 15 Administration The administration of the university is vested in the president and the administrative officers reporting to that office . Pursuant to the bylaws, the president is the university's leader of educational policy and its chief executive officer. The president reports at least annually to the trustees on Tufts' general condition and is responsible for the management of operating revenues and expenditures associated with educational, purchasing, and plant activities and for collection of income, insurance, and ta xes relating to institutional real estate. The president is further responsible for preparing the annual budget and establishing an adequate system of budget control. The senior staff reporting directly to the president include the provost and senior vice president, who is the chief academic officer responsible with the president for setting the institutional and budgetary priorities that advance Tufts' academic mission; an executive vice president, handling business, administrative, infrastructure, and fi nancial matters; a senior vice president for university relations, responsible for government and community relations, and legal counsel; a senior vice president for university advancement, responsible for all fundraising, alumni relations, advancement communications, and advancement services; a director of athletics; and a chief of staff, managing the president's office and overseeing presidential initiatives. The vice president of communications and marketing reports both to the senior vice president for university relations and the president. Other vice presidents bear primary operational responsibility. Also reporting directly to the university president is the dean of TUSM , who is also the chief academic officer for Tufts Medicine, the parent health system of TUSM 's principal teaching -hospital affiliate, Tufts Medical Center. The dean also simultaneously reports to the president and CEO of Tufts Medicine and serves on the senior leadership teams of both institutions. The vice provo st for research leads the Office of the Vice Provost of Research , which provides the key services necessary to deliver exceptional results in research. The president meets regularly with the Academic Council, composed of the senior staff, deans, and other academic leaders. In addition, the executive vice president chairs monthly meetings of an Administrative Council that includes the provost and senior vice president, and vice presidents reporting to the executive vice president and other administrative officers. Each school has, as academic leader, a dean who reports directly to the provost and serves on the Academic and Provost's Councils. The deans provide overall direction and leadership for their schools, and additional deans in each school have specific responsibilities (such as admissions, studen t affairs, faculty affairs, administrative and financial responsibilities , diversity/DEIJ) and report to the dean. GSBS (within TUSM) and GSAS and SMFA (within A&S) are considered \"schools within a school.\" They administer degree programs and have their ow n faculty bylaws, governance structure, and a degree of operational independence. Those school deans report to the deans of the primary schools. University College (UC) was founded in November 2018 and replaced the Tufts University C ollege of Special Studies, historically the home for continuing education and external academic partnerships at Tufts. UC was established to facilitate the development of university -wide degree and nondegree programs for matriculated students and to offer educational programs that reach new, nonmatriculated student populations. These university -wide programs now include multidisciplinary courses that could be taught by facu lty from two or more schools across the university. Tisch has evolved into a vibrant platform for local and global partnerships, for myriad student learning and service opportunities, and for groundbreaking research. 16 Faculty Each school has a faculty gov ernance structure that provides for faculty input into policies, procedures, and operations. The faculty exert direct control over curricular matters, including the approval of new courses and programs, while fulfilling an important advisory and supervisor y function in other areas such as tenure and promotion, admissions, facilities, and finances. The curricula offered through TUSM , TUSDM, Cummings School , SOE, and GSAS are also governed by their respective external accrediting bodies. Details of each schoo l's governance structure are in its faculty bylaws. As the largest two schools at the university, A&S and SOE have an extensive and complex governance structure , with each school maintaining separate faculty governance structures as well as a combined AS&E faculty body akin to a pair of federated schools. In each school or pair of federated schools , there is an executive committee or similar body that provides for communication and consultation between faculty and administration and oversees academic governance. The AS&E Executive Committee, for example, meets regularly with the deans of A&S and SOE, and with the provost and president, to plan faculty meeting agendas. Faculty are appointed as nonvoting representatives to three trus tee committees: Academic Affairs, Administration and Finance, and the Committee for University Advancement. Routine matters are handled through the faculty committee structures , but other important issues at both the school and university level are often considered by ad hoc task forces whose membership is generally selected by the administration in consultation with the faculty or the Faculty Senate. Department chairs and program directors also play an important governance role through day -to-day adminis tration, long -range planning, and as a conduit for information, concerns, and advice between faculty and administration. AS&E bylaws are amended as warranted and ad hoc and standing committees are created when deemed necessary. Examples include the Commi ttee on Faculty Work/Life, Committee on Advising and Co-Curricular Learning, and the Committee on Student Conduct (added in February 2019). The university -wide Faculty Senate was established in 2017 as a central, elected body to provide faculty representation from all schools of the university \"in order to facilitate and enhance the effectiveness of the governance of the university and further develop a shared sense of communi ty among its members.\" As a consultative and advisory body, the Faculty Senate works closely and in partnership with the provost's office. The Faculty Senate communicates the needs and concerns of the university faculty, contributes to policy formation, no minates faculty representatives for appointment to university -wide committees, and advises the administration on educational and research policy in a nonbinding process. The Senate has an executive committee that appoints members to each of its committees, takes recommendations to the Senate, and carries out any responsibilities and activities that the Senate may delegate. The president and provost are nonvoting ex -officio members of the Senate, and topics of concern may be introduced from either the admini stration or from faculty at any of the schools. The Senate president represents the Senate in its relations with the president, provost, and administration, and is a member of the Academic Council. Faculty of Tisch College Tisch faculty bylaws were cre ated in 2016. Tisch faculty contribute to the research, practice, and teaching mission of Tisch ; provide the academic supervision of students; develop and submit to the dean recommendations for new academic programs; review the curriculum ; and advise the dean on any policy affecting the future well -being of the College. Tenure appointments for Tisch faculty can only be granted by one of the schools in which that faculty member is jointly appointed. Faculty of University College 17 The faculty of UC include representatives who are selected from each of the schools and include a member from the Faculty Senate to form its governing body. Members of the UC faculty must hold a primary appointment in one of the schools of the university. Students Each school has a representative student organization, the largest being the Tufts Community Union (TCU) Senate , which represents the undergraduate student body. Each of the graduate and professional schools also has student governance bodies (councils) that liaise between the graduate student body and the faculty and administration and meet with school deans regularly. Additional details are provided in Standard 5. Like the faculty representatives, students serve as representatives to three trustee committees and from time to time are appointed to other trustee ad hoc committees and working groups of the administration. In November 2018, the Board of Trustees establi shed the Student Affairs Committee (a subcommittee of the Academic Affairs Committee). Two students (one undergraduate and one graduate) are appointed by the board as voting members on th e committee. The Fraternity and Sorority Community is a self -governing community run by four councils. All recognized fra ternities and sororities belong to the university's Inter -Greek Council and one of its established sub -councils. These councils are student -run organizations committed to setting policies, expectations , and community standards for the entire Fraternity and Sorority Community, and to holding individuals and organizations accountable to these standards. Each council works with an advisor from the Division of Student Affairs. The student -led governing councils provide an opportunity for self -governance within the fraternity and sorority community. Alumni The Tufts University Alumni Association (TUAA) was established in 1860 and now includes nearly 120,000 members. The TUAA , through its governing body , the Tufts Alumni Council , and the organized alumni groups of its professional schools , promotes Tufts' spirit, tradition, and collegiality and strengthens the links among members and their alma mater . The university president and other leaders meet regularly with these groups an d cosponsor activities and educational opportunities for the alumni. Alumni groups provide fundraising support to the university , mentor students , and offer career guidance to students and other alumni. Alumni are designated to serve on three trustee comm ittees: Academic Affairs, Administration and Finance , and the Committee for University Advancement. APPRAISAL Tufts has strong, inclusive, and effective governance structures and processes to exercise its fiduciary responsibilities and manage the routine business of the university while envisioning, improving , and implementing administrative and academic structures, and responding to the unexpected. There is open communication and broad trust that enables students, faculty, administration, advisory /other volunteers, and trustees to work together effectively and productively. Institutional structures and practices of self -examination allow the systems to evolve to meet changing needs and circumstances. Governing Board The Board of Trustees undergoe s regular self -review and adjusts its policies/procedures as needed. Following each of the board meetings, trustees evaluate the meeting and suggest improvements, as well as future discussion topics. With member input, the chair annually reviews the presid ent's performance and shares results with the board. The chair's performance is reviewed almost annually by the board. From time to time, the board reflects on its structure and performance, often with the 18 guidance of a professional facilitator specializin g in higher education and/or corporate governance. The board measures the engagement of its members by tracking meeting attendance and participation in committee work. Trustee attendance at board meetings averages 90 percent (most recent five years) , with most trustees demonstrating engagement by serving on two or more standing committees and more than 50 percent also serving on Boards of Advisors. The board establishes ad hoc committees and advisory groups to respond to board and university initiati ves. For example: In 2019 the trustees adopted a policy to establish an advisory group \"to develop a process by which the Tufts community may raise and study concerns surrounding potential social impact caused by investing activities .\" In such cases, a Res ponsible Investment Advisory Group (RIAG) could provide advisory recommendations to the Investment Subcommittee, a subcommittee of the Trustee Administration and Finance Committee. Responding to the university community's concerns about climate change and catalyzed by a request from students and faculty, the Board of Trustees formed a RIAG to analyze Tufts ' investments in fossil fuels. Through collaborative discussions and analysis on that topic, the RIAG recommended to the board divestment from certain fos sil fuels and other actions that would advance the cause of climate action and have a positive impact on the university, its community, and environmental sustainability . Similarly, in 2021, recognizing that the rise of antisemitism is distinct from other forms of discrimination that the university is addressing, the Board of Trustees initiate d a separate effort to learn more about how this rise in antisemitism in higher education is manifesting itself at Tufts, and formed an ad hoc Committee on Antisemitis m. The committee was comprised of trustees, senior leadership , and members of the administration. With the expertise of external consultants and input from focus groups and a student survey, the committee presented the board and administration with its recommendations within a seven -month period. Administration A cohesive and high -functioning senior leadership group closely monitors the main divisions of the university and shares responsibility for analysis and problem -solving. With regular consultation with the Academic Council and the Administrative Council and ongoing review of institutional compliance with regulatory matters through the university's Risk and Compliance Committee , academic and administrative objectives are consistently met. Risk is regularly assessed, and operational procedures are revised and reviewed with the boa rd at each board meetin g. Institutional response to anti -racism and the COVID -19 pandemic is evidence of a coordinated and collaborative administration, which includes the Board of Trustees' support of the president's commitment of $ 25 million in funding for the Tufts as an Anti -Racist Institution initiative. Additionally, the Board of Trustees redoubled its efforts to diversify the board's membership and cultivate volunteers who reflect the community of students and alumni. Each school created or expanded staff in its Office of Diversity and Inclusion. The faculty of A&S voted to amend the school bylaws to create a DEIJ Committee , and the Board of Trustees approved this change in August 2022 . Faculty Faculty have oversight over faculty governa nce structure and provide frequent input to the administration of their respective schools. The AS&E Executive Committee meets annually with standing committee chairs to assess effectiveness and highlight any emerging issues. The Executive Committee facili tates changes to committees' composition or responsibilities , which must be subsequently approved as bylaw changes. Performance of the president, provost, and deans is reviewed periodically with input from faculty and often with assistance of an outside consultant. Each school has its own process for soliciting faculty input for reviews of the administration. For example, the AS&E Faculty Advisory Board for Administrati on, elected from the tenured faculty, participates in the review of the A&S and SOE deans, as well as president and provost reviews. 19 Attendance at faculty meetings increased significantly when held virtually throughout the pandemic. Faculty teaching remot ely and those teaching at SMFA can participate without the need to travel to the Medford/Somerville campus. Virtual participation of SMFA faculty has done much to include and engage that A&S faculty group in a participative governance process. In the shor t time since its founding in 2017, the Faculty Senate has developed a healthy working relationship among the schools and with the administration. Through the Senate's advisory function, administrative and school -based faculty decision making is more inform ed. Members of the Senate have participated in hiring searches for senior leadership positions, most recently for the vice provost positions in Education and in DEIJ. Three of the six faculty representatives to the trustee committees are members of the Fac ulty Senate. The Faculty Senate has strengthened the voice of the faculty. Student s The student body and the administration benefit from frequent and regular communication at various levels to raise awareness of issues facing both groups and to address those concerns. Meetings between the TCU president and vice president and the universit y president and provost are most productive in address ing long-term challenges facing the undergraduate population rather than in addressing singular issues. An evolution of the TCU senator positions has improved the representation of the broad range of id entity groups on campus . Over the past decade, the TCU Senate added the role of \"Community Senators \" who are elected by the student body and represent nine identity groups: Africana Community, Asian American Community, First Generation College Students Community, International Community, Latinx Community, LBGTQ+ Commun ity, SMFA Community, Women's Community , and Native/Indigenous Community . The Senate also regularly holds town meetings to ask about issues that students feel need to be addressed. Through its role of allocating funding from activities fees collected, the Senate has ongoing communication with all recognized student organizations on campus. On occasion, formal resolutions from the TCU Senate are presented to the board and the administration to express the desires of the student body to bring about institutio nal change. Those resolutions are shared with the Board of Trustees and/or other responsible groups and thoughtfully deliberated. Responses are sent to the Senate/Tufts community when warranted. PROJECTION Governing Board The governance mechanisms at all levels and across the institution are responding to an ongoing need for change to adapt to the transformation of Tufts University and the higher education landscape. To be sure it fulfills its fiduciary responsibilities adequately, the Board of Trustees will take on a more vigorous and regular self -assessment to drive positive change in its membership and duties. Board plenary sessions and retreats provide opportunit ies to discuss such matters , and outside governance experts can provide structure for productive conversations. Board diversity is a priority for the Committee on Trusteeship , and the university bylaws, while regularly reviewed and amended, should be updated to reflect current university practices. The Board of Trustees will be working to determine how it will embrace the DEIJ requirement in an official statement . Other volunteer advisory groups must do the same. The Boards of Advisors, working closely with the provost's office and the trustees, have made noteworthy progress in instituting and enforcing term limits and diversifying membership. As inconsistencies acr oss the 10 boards and over 260 members are identified, they are addressed by each board, the administration, and the overarching Council of the Boards of Advisors. 20 Administration Leadership transitions are ubiquitous given the size and scope of the unive rsity. President Monaco will step down in the summer of 202 3, to be succeeded by Dr. Sunil Kumar . In January 2022 an interim provost took office, and the reorganization of the entire provost's office was assessed with the assistance of outside consultants. Recommendations were made to clarify and strengthen key roles through a new organizational struct ure of vice provost positions overseeing: education; research; faculty affairs; DEIJ; and innovation. All searches have now concluded, with the final new vice provost role starting in April 2023. School deans and associate deans have taken up new roles re cently and are instituting a variety of programmatic and administrative changes. DEIJ structures have been created across each of the schools of the university and reflect the needs of the school consistent with the overall goals of the university's anti-racist initiative . The most noteworthy change is the expanded role of the dean of TUSM who is now also the chief academic officer for Tufts Medicine, which is in the process of developing a novel governance structure of its own. Faculty Faculty workload continues be an impediment to more faculty involvement in governance. Committee positions go unfilled due to the time commitment required of faculty. Some suggest more incentives (including course releases) that might alleviate the pressure on faculty time. Some faculty anticipate the Faculty Senate will have more direct policymaking impact at the university. A tension exists between the Senate's expectations for i nvolvement in university -level decision making and their advisory role to the administration stipulated in the Senate bylaws. In order to further strengthen the relationship between the faculty and central administration , that tension needs to be addressed in a way that recognizes the critical role the faculty play in the advancement of the university's strategic and academic missions. Students The professional and graduate students recently have instituted governance structures universally , and individual governance groups currently exist for those communities (for example, AS&E , GSBS ). Effectiveness of undergraduate student governance at Tufts falls largely on the TCU Senate , which has instituted needed changes in representation . Since serving on the Senate is only one of many opportunities for leadership experience for undergraduates, interest in student governmen t has diminished , with some elected positions going unfilled or uncontested. Further, there is an increasing expectation that student leaders, including those in student government, be paid. This is a fundamenta l cultural shift; meeting those students' expectations could have a significant budgetary impact. 21 STANDARD 4 : The Academic Program DESCRIPTION Academic Mission Tufts describes itself as a \"student -centered research university\" and is proud of being one of the smallest universities in the \"very high research activity\" R1 Carnegie classification. The students and faculty on each campus form a close community. In the words of our mission statement , our goal is to facilitate \"transformative experiences for students and faculty in an inclusive and collaborative environment.\" Tufts offers over 400 programs leading to bachelor's, master's, doctoral , and professional degre es, and to certificates. Since the last accreditation cycle , Tufts has acquired SMFA , which is now a semi -independent entity within A&S. Tufts has also combined its various continuing education programs, pre -college programs, and other nondegree offerings into University College. Ensuring Quality In each school, new degree programs are first approved by the school faculty and school leadership , then reviewed by the PDAC, with final approval by the provost and the Academic Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees. New concentrations or tracks within existing degrees, changes to curriculum 22 requirements, and changes to individual courses are approved by a curriculum committee in each school and then by the school faculty. Academic requirements for each schoo l's programs are clearly defined and readily available in the Bulletins of the schools, all of which are online. Retention and completion rates are strong. Except for 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, 96 -97 percent of first -year undergrads return for the second year (and in 2020, 92 percent persisted). Undergraduates consistently have a four -year graduation rate of 86-90 percent and a six -year rate of 92 -94 percent . Each school also has resources to help students who may be struggling, academically, physi cally, or mentally; for more on this , refer to Standard 5. Learning outcomes have been defined for each program , and faculty are responsible for checking that students have achieved them. See Standard 8 for more information. Integrity in the Award of Credi t The last accreditation cycle raised questions about the credit values of some of our courses. AS&E , in particular, defined 1 Tufts Credit as equivalent to 4 Carnegie units, but as most courses met for 150 minutes and the AS&E Faculty Handbook said the normal guideline was to assign two hours of homework for each class hour, it seemed that most courses were in fact mor e like 3 Carnegie units. Moreover, Tufts did not consistently give more credit for courses with higher workloads. The AS&E Educational Policy Committee formed a subcommittee in fall 2013 to study the problem, and in April 2015 the AS&E faculty voted in fav or of changing to semester -hour units (SHUs). The change took effect in fall 2018, so the undergraduate class of 2021 was the last cohort to matriculate under the old Tufts credit system: current students have only used SHUs. Other Tufts schools made the c onversion at the same time. The university registrars , the educational technology group, and the student services teams were particularly helpful in making adjustments to all the systems that needed to change. Credit policies and review mechanisms in each school are discussed further below. For more explanation on SHUs, see Work Room Documents Standard 4 -1. Diversity, Equity, Inclusion , and Justice (DEIJ) Tufts has always been committed to diversity , and in 2020 the administration committed significant funding to the Tufts as an Anti -Racist Institution initiative. Over 180 recommendations, across the five workstreams, were submitted to the senior leadership team for consideration . The recommendations relevant to Standard 4 primarily concerned curriculum; fo r example, examining all courses through an anti-racist lens by considering syllabi, course material, and pedagogical practices. There has also been discussion about reformulating the existing \"world civilization\" requirement in the A&S undergraduate progr am to focus more on equity and justice. Each school reviewed the recommendations in the report , and many created DEIJ strategies and new standing committees on DEIJ as a result. The school -level associate deans for diversity and inclusion have been essenti al in this process. Online Education and New Markets Over the past few years Tufts has developed several online master 's degree programs, some in partnership with o nline program management (OPM) providers such as 2U and Noodle. Programs developed in TUSM, Fletcher, Friedman, SOE, and A&S are intended for working professionals and are developed and approved with the same rigor and mechanisms as all of Tufts' face-to-face programs. Verification of student identity for distance education happens through many methods such as 2-factor authentication for both synchronous and asynchronous engagement in courses, live synchronous sessions, proctored exams, Enrollment Advisor conversations (raising flags if necessary) , ensuring application items map to the individual , and more. The experience gained by the university and its faculty during the last two years of the pandemic, with the abrupt transition to online learning and eventual return to in -person teaching , has prompted the offering of online sections in traditionally face -to-face programs. For example, the Romance Studies Department in A&S now offers online sections of elementary Spanish and French to increase capacity. 23 Tufts has always offered lifelong le arning programs, but it is increasingly clear that the university will have more effect on society as it serves a larger subset of the population, beyond traditional -age undergraduates and conventional graduate programs. UC has become the home for pre -college programs, summer and winter terms outside the normal fall and spring semesters, and various continuing education programs. The number of pre -college programs has increased rapidly; these are offered through UC not only by the undergraduate schools but also by TUSM and Tisch. UC has also subsumed the Tufts chapter of the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, a program for adults aged 50 and over offering short -term study groups but no credit -bearing classes. UC is responsible for marketing the continuing education and lifelong learning programs throughout the Boston area and beyond. APPRAISAL A&S Undergrad uate Programs , including SMFA In 2021 -2022 there were 5,270 undergraduates in A&S, just over 81 percent of all full -time undergraduates. Of these , 204 were enrolled in SMFA's B .F.A. program and 288 in the B .A./B.F.A. combined degree program. Although Tufts and SMFA had been partners for many years, Tufts formally acquired SMFA as a unit within A&S. There are now three undergraduate programs offered by A&S: the B .A./B.S. program (A&S in the strict sense), the B .F.A program at SMFA, and the combined degree leading to a B .F.A. plus a B .A. or B.S. Enrollment in the B .A./B.S. program has grown from 4,200 in fall 2013 to 4,778 in fall 2021. Enrollment in the B .F.A program dipped shortly after Tufts acquired SMFA but has returned to just above its fall 2016 level (which was 191). The combined degree program has increased steadily and significantly, from 67 students in fall 2017 to 285 in fall 2021. Curriculum . The B .A./B.S. program combines depth and breadth. Students choose from 65 different majors, ranging from disciplinary programs like mathematics or English to interdisciplinary fields like international relations, cognitive and brain science, or science, technology, and society. The major consists of at least 10 classes, adding up to at least 30 SHUs, though many majors require more than 30 and students are free to take more than the minimum required. Several majors can only be second majors: civ ic studies; education; environmental studies; science, technology, and society; urban and environmental policy; and the majors in biomedical sciences and biotechnology offered for A&S students by SOE . Students may have more than one major or may add on e or more of 74 minors. About one-third of students graduate with a second major and about 40 percent with a minor, usually only one. The most popular majors are international relations, economics, computer science, and biology. As the figure shows, so cial sciences have always been the most popular majors, and STEM fields have grown, at the expense of the humanities and the social sciences, in the last 10 years, mainly due to the increase in students majoring in computer science.2 This is consistent with trends in degrees awarded across the U.S. In addition to the major, the curriculum also requires foundation courses (writing in English, foreign language, world civilization) and distribution courses (in humanities, arts, mathematics, natural science, and social science). This broad exposure, with interdisciplinary connections among courses and fields, is central to Tufts' definition of an educated person. Students are expected to attain minimal proficiency in a language other than English, through a three -course sequence; the second part of the language requirement can be satisfied with three more advanced courses in the same language, the three -course beginning sequence in a different language, or three courses given in English about a single culture 2 The number of computer science majors in A&S doubled with the class of 2014 and has nearly doubled again since then. 24 area. The world civilization requirement is a single course dealing with a \"non -Western civilization.\"3 Students may satisfy the writing and foreign language requirements, or part of those requirements, with pre-matriculation credit from standardized exams they took in high school. The distribution requirement is at least two courses (six SHUs ) in each of the five distribution areas. These courses may also count toward a student's major. Students may count one pre -matriculation exam score toward each distribution area but must take at least one course in each area at Tufts. While converting from Tufts Credits to SHUs, the departments and the Committee on Curricula reviewed every course in the catalog to assign the correct new credit value. The general requirements were also reviewed, but only in order to translate them into the new system; the goal of this work was to avoid making any substantive changes to the curricul um. Indeed, A&S has not conducted a comprehensive review of its curriculum in decades. While the model of foundation requirements, distribution requirements, and a major is flexible, there is a growing belief among students and faculty that there seem to b e too many requirements. Before the SHU conversion, the undergraduate program was divided into roughly equal parts: one-third for the major (10 or 11 out of 34 Tufts Credits ), one-third for basic requirements (more or less, depending on placement), and one-third for free electives. The conversion has apparently made most majors smaller relative to the total program and reduced the proportion of the program devoted to basic requirements, leaving more time for electives. We conjecture that this may be contrib uting to the small rise in the number of students attempting and completing second majors. The B .F.A. program and the B .A./B.F.A. combined degree are offered at SMFA . Prior to Tufts' acquisition of SMFA in 2016, art offerings from each institution were se parate: SMFA students took their studio courses at the school's Fenway campus while they fulfilled most general liberal arts requirements in Medford at the main Tufts campus. Meanwhile, Tufts nonstudio undergraduate majors were mostly taking art courses th at faculty taught in studio facilities in Medford, and these classes were not open to SMFA students. Since the merger of the two schools, there has been an effort to integrate the faculties and the student bodies and to allow both the studio art students and the nonstudio students more options and flexibility in course selections. In particular, nonstudio majors may now take studio art courses on the Fenway campus, as space permits (B .F.A. students have priority in registering for them). Additionally, studio courses usually taught by SMFA/Fenway faculty have opened up at the Medford campus with the renovation of Barnum Hall, so that art faculty on both campuses have increasing ability to te ach courses at either location. The eventual goal is that any undergraduate student may take any art course at either campus, as long as any prerequisite s are fulfilled. SMFA offers five programs: a Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.), a Master of Arts in Teachi ng in Art Education (M.A.T.), a post -baccalaureate certificate in studio art, a Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.), and a combined undergraduate degree (B .F.A. and B .A. or B.S.). The B .F.A. curriculum requires 76 SHUs of studio art, 15 SHUs of art history, the same writing courses as in the B .A./B.S. programs, and one course (3 or more SHUs) in each of four distribution areas: humanities, social science, language and culture, and science and technology. Students thus have only 11 SHUs available for free electives (in a 120-SHU program). The B .A./B.F.A. combined degree program combines the requirements of the B .A. or B.S. degree and the B .F.A., and normally requires five years. SMFA does not have required periodic reviews of all programs, though programs are reassessed when enrollments decrease . An example is the Studio Diploma Program, discontinued in 2017. The Curriculum Committee at SMFA, composed of faculty and students, reviews the undergraduate curriculum every year to identify redundan cies, vet new course proposals, and help plan long -term curricular directions. The Committee makes suggestions for course modifications, including course title changes, credit allocation, whether a course is a seminar, a studio class, or a hybrid, and whet her a course is too heavily focused on one aspect, or not enough in another. Changes to courses and to the 3 We now recognize that \"non -Western\" is a problematic term; this language has been in the Bulletin since about 1994. 25 curriculum are approved by SMFA faculty, then brought to the A&S Committee on Curricula. Minor changes are simply passed by that committee, and more significant ones are brought to the A&S faculty like changes in any other courses and programs in A&S. In the past three years, SMFA faculty have reviewed nearly all the courses, adjusting titles and descriptions to make them more uniform with those in A&S . Graduate courses go through the SMFA Graduate Steering Committee, though the faculty are considering using the same Curriculum Committee for those as for undergraduate courses. As SMFA had used Carnegie units for credit before the merger, it has been min imally affected by the conversion from Tufts Credits to SHUs. End-of-year reviews of all faculty are an opportunity to incorporate student feedback about courses and to adjust them, for example if there are too many assignments or too few, or if the prerequisite s should be changed. Furthermore, since 2019, SMFA has had an Anti -Racist, Anti -Bias Coalition of faculty, staff, and students that assists faculty in diversifying their syllabi. Student research and theses. Roughly 500 to 600 students (more than 10 percent of the AS&E undergraduate student body) annually engage in original research activity. These experiences include senior theses and involve working with faculty from all AS&E divisions and the health scienc es schools and hospitals, often resulting in joint publications. There are several programs that can provide funding for student research projects, notably the Summer Scholars program, which gives rising juniors and seniors a stipend, a research budget, an d a faculty mentor for a significant research project, often leading to a senior honors thesis. Other experiential learning. In some programs, such as psychology, film and media studies, and political science, students may receive credit for internships; they are expected to write a paper or a reflective journal as part of the experience. In community health and environmental studies, the internship is a required capstone for the major. The Career Center helps students find placements. Students may also t each courses through the Experimental College. The ExCollege, instituted in 1964, offers small classes in subjects beyond the official curriculum, taught by experts of various sorts , from attorneys to entrepreneurs and journalists to activists. ExCollege c ourses carry full credit and count as electives. Students or pairs of students may apply to teach courses on any topic; recent course titles include Abolitionist Organizing: Community, Re -imagination, and Liberation, 1968: Year of Global Revolt, and Unpack ing Expertise: Science, Society, and Self. During the fall semester, students teach in the Explorations program for first -year students, a small -group peer advising program that supplements ordinary pre -major advising. Students who teach in the ExCollege t ake a workshop on teaching methods. Study abroad programs. Although study abroad was curtailed from 2020 -2022 due to the pandemic, many A&S students spend a summer, a semester, or a term studying abroad; in a typical year over 500 undergraduates go abroad . Tufts offers programs in Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa, and allows students to study on non -Tufts programs. The Tufts European Center in Talloires, France , runs a summer program for undergraduates and another for high school students. There are also shorter programs, typically three to five weeks, running during the winter break or during the summer: for example, there is a program in data science and computer science in Pavia , Italy, and one on ancient Gaul in France. Learning assessment. A standing committee on learning outcomes assessment (LOAC) collects and publishes the learning outcomes established by each department for its majors and minors, and by the faculty as a whole for the general education requirements. Departments are to review w hether students attain the desired outcomes. In 2019, LOAC asked each department , \"Why do you teach what you teach?\" and \"How do you know that you accomplish what you are trying to accomplish in your teaching?\" The committee reported back to the faculty th at departments' core values include \"disciplinary literacy, critical evaluation, and critical understanding.\" The committee is now working on ways to assess student learning . 26 Department and program reviews. The Dean's Office facilitates periodic external reviews of A&S departments and programs, roughly every 10 years. The department does a self -study , and a visiting committee is invited to interview department faculty, students, and deans. The self -study documents the current state of the department, including enrollments, faculty research, student research and other achievements, and learning objectiv es. The department is also invited to describe its own strengths and weaknesses, efforts it has made to diversify faculty and enrolled students, and how it interacts with other departments in A&S and across Tufts . Student attitudes and satisfaction . The OIR surveys undergraduates at the end of their first, second, and final years. These surveys ask about students' satisfaction with their education in general, and about various specific points such as advising and skills development . See Standard 5 for more information. New programs. Since 2013, several undergraduate majors have been introduced or substantially revised: music, sound, and culture ; Spanish cultural studies ; Japanese cultural studies ; environmental geology ; education ; applied environmental studies ; civic studies ; science , technology , and society ; and film and media studies . Community health , formerly a program, has become a department. The new Department of Studies in Race, Colonialism, and Diaspora (RCD) incorporates the existing programs in Africana studies , American studies , Asian American studies , and Latinx studies , and has created new programs in Native American and Indigenous studies , colonialism studies , and RCD. Civic studies incorporates the former program in peace and justice studies . The Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences is about to change its name to Earth and Climate Sciences and will add a new major in climate science . The civic studies major is run by faculty affiliated with Tisch. Civic studies courses are also offered to students in the Tufts University Prison Initiative (TUPIT), created in 2016. People incarcerated in Massachusetts Correctional Institution - Concord (MCI -Conco rd) and other facilities take courses taught by Tufts faculty. TUPIT students can earn an associate's degree from Bunker Hill Community College. Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) GSAS is the graduate section of A&S, offering 31 master 's programs (M .A., M.S., M.A.T.), 15 Ph.D. programs, and the doctorate in occupational therapy . The M .F.A. in studio art, offered by SMFA, is formally also part of GSAS and is administered by SMFA faculty. The student body has grown by about 10 percent , from 901 students in fall 2013 to 1 ,000 in fall 2021, with just over half in master 's programs; first-year graduate enrollments have increased from 377 in 2013 to 511 in 2021. Several new graduate programs have been introduced since Tufts ' last accreditati on: a Master in Physics Education, joint between the departments of Physics and Education; a Master in Data Analytics; a Master in Diversity and Inclusion Leadership; a Master in Sustainability; and a Ph.D. in Economic Development, joint between the department of Economics and the Fletcher School. Graduate certificate programs in impact investing and in curatorial studies are to be established in the next year. The Graduate Policy and Programs Committee, consisting of the graduate program directors of each department with a graduate program, reviews any changes to curricula or courses in GSAS. Master 's degree programs have a core of course -based instruction, and many have research or thesis tracks in which students complete a research project and pres ent results to a thesis committee. Most master 's degrees must be completed within five years, though the majority take only one or two years. Doctoral programs require at least three years of full -time study and successful submission of a dissertation. Pub lishing peer -reviewed papers is expected outside of the humanities, although the scope varies by discipline. In the humanities, peer -reviewed conference presentations are expected. Most programs emphasize teaching and original research. GSAS prides itself on its mentorship of students; students have advisors even before they start writing the thesis or dissertation. 27 Learning assessment. The A&S program reviews, described above, also include reviews of the graduate programs in departments that have them. Ea ch department reviews the progress of its own graduate students and maintains its own learning objectives for graduate programs, typically documented on the department's website. Training future teachers. Many graduate students go on to teach, whether in colleges or in K -12 education. Students prepare for K -12 teaching careers in the M .A.T. program in the Department of Education, and in the M .A.-plus-licensure program in the classical studies department . Ph.D. students can be teaching assistants and can be instructors of record for their own courses, in their home departments and in the ExCollege. The Graduate Institute for Teaching (GIFT) is a fellowship program run by GSAS, open to graduate students across Tu fts. Students take a two -week summer workshop, after which they partner with a faculty member to teach a course; the GIFT fellows work on the syllabus and assessments and lead class at least twice, but they are not the primary instructors in these courses. Other professional development. GSAS offers a series of workshops on scholarship, leadership, communication, DEIJ, and other topics. Students who complete at least four of these workshops can receive the \"Notation of Development\" certification on their t ranscripts. Additionally, t he Graduate Research Excellence at Tufts (GREAT) workshop is a three -week summer program intended for graduate students just beginning to do research, aimed at teaching students how to organize a research project, communicate the ir research to general audiences or interviewers, and cultivate a professional image. The Graduate Leadership in Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (GLIDE) workshop begins with a week -long summer workshop and continues with a practicum during the fall semest er; the goal is for students to understand the importance of DEI J in the workplace and how to implement change in their institutions. Students accepted into either of these workshops receive stipends. Additionally, the Graduate Institute for Teaching (GIFT ) is a two -phase program designed to prepare doctoral students for an academic career in teaching at the university level, consisting of summer workshops on pedagogy combined with semester co -teaching with a Tufts faculty member. School of Engineering, Graduate and Undergr aduate (SOE) SOE offers 16 undergraduate degree programs, one of which is the BS -no major program, for students who want a broader, more expansive undergraduate engineering degree. The Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Chemical En gineering also offer second majors, and engineering students may also complete a second major or a minor from the A&S offerings. Eight of the undergraduate programs are accredited by Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc (ABET ). SOE enrolls roughly 1 ,100 undergraduates and offers students \"a rigorous engineering education enhanced by interdisciplinary connections in arts, humanities, and science,\" in the w ords of its 2019 strategic plan. There are 19 M .S. programs, two of which ( computer science and data science ) are offered in parallel in-person and online versions. The Innovation and Management Program is a dual -degree program between SOE and the Gordon Institute. S OE offers 10 Ph.D. programs and collaborates with A&S on the Ph.D. program in cognitive science . It also offers 16 graduate or post -baccalaureate certificate programs. Over 870 students are enrolled in the graduate programs and certifica te programs. Since 2013, SOE has introduced new undergraduate programs in data science, environmental health, and human factors (all in 2019), and a new M .S. program in innovation and management (in 2017). All undergraduate programs require at least 120 S HUs, of which at least 30 are in engineering or computing (and at least 45 for ABET -accredited programs), at least 30 are in science or mathematics, and at least 24 are in humanities, arts, or social sciences. Master's programs require at least 10 courses and at least 30 SHUs; Ph.D. programs typically require at least 16 courses. Undergraduate programs may update their degree programs each year. Routine updates are reviewed by the relevant departments first, and then by the chair of the Curriculum Committe e and the dean of 28 undergraduate advising . Larger updates are reviewed by the Curriculum Committee and the school faculty. Many undergraduate programs have external advisory boards composed of alumni and employers, and sometimes students. Individual undergr aduate courses are reviewed by the Curriculum Committee and approved by the faculty. Routine changes to courses go into a consent agenda for faculty approval; larger -scale changes can be discussed and voted individually. Graduate programs and policies are reviewed by the Committee on Graduate Studies and Research, which includes a member from each department. Learning assessment. For the ABET -accredited programs, the Educational Objectives and Outcomes Assessment Committee has responsibility for assessing students' educational experience. It reviews the degree programs, facilitates programs' own self -studies, and coordinates surveys of students and alumni. Learning objectives for each undergraduate program are prominently posted on the departments' web page s. Student research, graduate and undergraduate. More than 60 percent of engineering undergraduates do research, whether in faculty laboratories, in internships, or in other settings. Seniors may write an honors thesis. SOE students also participate in research through Tisch. Graduate students also do research. In most master's programs they may choose whether to write a thesis or take additional courses, but even those who do not write a thesis may be research assistants or members of a f aculty member's lab. Ph.D. students are generally associated with faculty research laboratories and may receive stipends as research assistants. Funding is available through several sources. Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy (Fletcher) Fletcher offers 10 master 's programs, ranging in length from one to two years. It offers two Ph.D. programs, one in international affairs and one in economics and public policy, jointly with the Department of Economics in A&S. The Master of Arts in Humanitarian Affairs (MAHA) is offered jointly with the Friedman School, the Master of Science in Cybersecurity and Public Policy is joint with SOE , and the Master of Arts in Transatlantic Affairs (MATA) is joint with the College of Europe, in Bruges or Warsaw. The flagship program is the Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy (MALD), a two-year program enrolling more than half of Fletcher's students. The Master of International Business (M .I.B.) and the MATA are also two-year degrees. The Master of Global Affairs (M.G.A.) program is 18 months, and the Master of Global Business Administration (G.B.A.) is 16 months . M.G.A. is a new program, with the first cohort arriving in academic year ( AY) 2021 -2022. A second new program, G.B.A., welcomed its first new class in the summer of 2019. After internal discussion and research, these new programs were created to meet the needs of the marketplace, be more competitive, offer more flexibility, and meet the needs of students. The M .G.A., G.B.A., MATA, and cybersecurity programs, and the Ph.D. in economics and public policy, are all new since 2013. The L .Ll.M. in International Law, Global Master of Arts (GMAP), the joint degrees with SOE and Friedman, and the Master of Arts are one-year programs. The GMAP program is hybrid, with two week - long in -person residencies and a synchronous virtual residency, coupled with online course work. The G.B.A. program, similarly, is primarily online, with two in -person sessions of three to four days each. Fletcher also runs an executive education program of short continuing education courses, intended for \"professionals interested in increasing their understanding of complex issues facing today's global leaders.\" Fletcher students may cross -regis ter into a limited number of courses at other parts of Tufts University or at Harvard University. Also, i n addition to the joint degree programs noted above, Fletcher offers multiple dual degree programs with universities in the U .S., Austria, China, Franc e, India, Mexico, Spain, and Switzerland. Learning assessment . Students write both course and program evaluations at the end of each term. They are asked to complete an end -of-program survey upon graduation, which focuses on the student 29 experience as well as learning and career outcomes. Response rate for each of the three evaluation tools is above 60 percent and is often higher. The faculty, program administrators, and deans review these evaluations annually to ensure a high -quality program that meets student needs. Although Fletcher does not require periodic reviews of programs, since the last ac creditation self -study, all programs except the MALD, L .Ll.M., and M .A. have been reviewed by committees of faculty and staff and PDAC , sometimes supplemented with outside consultants. In addition, each new program is reviewed within three to five years af ter its inception. Reviews of the M .I.B. and the GMAP programs in the last year produced recommendations for revisions to their curricula, to provide the knowledge and skills professionals need in the rapidly evolving global context. The L .Ll.M. program wi ll be reviewed in the coming 2023 academic year. Fletcher's Academic Council, which subsumes the former Curriculum Committee, has responsibility for curriculum, including changes to degree requirements or to individual courses. Research and professional development . All students are required to complete a capstone experience, which the Fletcher faculty consider a fundamental part of the curriculum. For most students, this capstone is a thesis or other research project, a policy paper, a busin ess case study, or the like; in the Ph.D. programs, the dissertation is the capstone. In the new M .G.A. program, the capstone experience is a practicum rather than a written paper. Certain courses are called \"incubator courses ,\" as they help support the de velopment of a capstone project. They may introduce research methods or help students develop necessary skills. In addition to their required capstone projects, Fletcher students edit several peer -reviewed research journals. Fletcher offers workshops on professional skills, from data analytics to podcast development. The number of such cocurricular workshops has increased substantially in recent years. A professional development program is an integral part of the master 's degree programs. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy (Friedman) Friedman offers three master 's programs and one Ph.D. program and collaborates in several other master 's programs. There are five divisions within the school, offering an M.S. or Ph.D. : biochemical and molecular nutrition ; agriculture , food, and the environment ; nutrition interventions , communication , and behavior change ; food and nutrition policy and programs ; and nutritional epidemiology and data science . The M .S. program requires 48 SHUs and is designe d to be completed in two academic years. Three of the divisions require an internship, normally done in the summer after the first year ; another division requires laboratory work ; and another offers the option to write a thesis. Two other in -person M.S. degrees are not housed in the divisions. The Master of Arts in Humanitarian Assistance (MAHA) program is a one -year, 30 -SHU program, joint with Fletcher, requiring a capstone experi ence. The Master of Science in Nutrition + Didactic program in Dietetics is joint with Tufts Medical Center. The Master in Nutrition Science and Policy (MNSP ) degree is a blended program, with asynchronous online courses and a one -week residency each trime ster. This structure allows students to maintain their careers, live where they choose, and build meaningful relationships and networks with peers and faculty. Friedman also partners with Simmons University, allowing Friedman graduate students to participa te in their Didactic Program in Dietetics Certificate program. Learning assessment. The Curriculum and Degrees Committee has responsibility for assessing students' educational experience. It reviews the degree programs, requirements, and courses, and, working with the academic dean, coordinates and reviews surveys of students. Students a re asked to write course evaluations for each course they complete; although the response rate varies, typically 50-70 percent of students do so. They are required to complete an end -of-program survey just before graduation, which asks about the student ex perience, students' assessment of teaching and curriculum, and their employment (or further education) after graduation. Graduates are surveyed again six months after graduation, asking about employment or other outcomes. Period ic surveys of alumni assess how 30 well prepared they were for employment after graduation. All these evaluations, which are reviewed by the division chairs , deans , and other academic leaders each year, are taken into account to ensure a high-quality program that meets student needs. The standards of satisfactory academic progress (SAP) measure a student's performance in three areas: maximum time to complete the degree, cumulative grade point average, and cumulative completion rate. The students' academic progress is evaluated at the en d of each semester using criteria for each of these three areas. Students must maintain SAP to remain in good academic standing. Research and professional development . Friedman conducts important research, with significant local, national, and global effe cts. Almost all faculty conduct funded research, individually and in collaborative teams. Friedman has one research center, the Feinstein International Center, which focuses on humanitarian assistance. Other major initiatives include ChildObesity180 and th e USDA - funded Food Systems for Nutrition Innovation Lab. Scientists at the USDA Jean Mayer Human Research Center on Aging at Tufts University (HNRCA) are the majority of faculty in the Division of Biochemical and Molecular Nutrition. This center gives M .S. and Ph.D. students opportunities for laboratory and human research, including required lab practica. About 50 -65 percent of Friedman master 's students participate in faculty research. Capstone experiences are required for the Master of Humanitarian Assistance degree. Master' s theses are required for students in the Master of Nutrition Science and Policy degree and optional for other M.S. degrees. Other integrative experiences include in ternships and participation in the School's Food and Nutrition Innovation Institute and its New Entry Sustainable Farming Project. For Ph.D. students, who generally work as members of their dissertation advisor's research group, the dissertation is the capstone. School of Dental Medicine (TUSDM) In addition to the D .M.D. program, TUSDM offers a Master of Science in Dental Research and some twenty certificate programs for practicing dentists. The D .M.D. for international students (ISDMD) is formally a separ ate program, intended for dentists who have practiced in other countries and want to obtain U .S. licensure; it is 2.5 years long and corresponds to the third and fourth years of the D .M.D. program. The new D.Sc. in Dentistry is a research degree, offered t o dentists who already hold a D.M.D., D.D.S., or B .D.S.; it may be combined with any of the advanced education certificates. The dental education program (D .M.D.) and certificate programs are accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA). Since 2013, new advanced education programs have been added in oral medicine and in orofacial pain. The D .M.D./M.S. combined program and the D .M.D./M.P.H. combined program have been suspended . A significant feature of TUSDM's program is its emphasis on culturally competent care. A course called Introduction to the Dental Patient, extending through the first three years of the D .M.D. program, helps students learn to communicate with diverse groups of patients, staff, and colleag ues. Other courses include Management of the Special Needs Dental Patient , Preventive Management of Medically Compromised Patients , and Health Communication and Dentistry. The basic medicine course, in the first two years, also emphasizes culturally sensit ive communication with patients. Learning assessment. Courses are evaluated every year. Students answer feedback questionnaires on their classes and on their teaching faculty. Each year's review looks at the last three years' data and fosters continuing e nhancement. Students are assessed not only on written work but also on simulated and actual clinical experiences, for which there are defined rubrics. They track their own progress in a formal notebook (the Student Clinical Achievement Logbook). Students a re included in school -wide surveys on the culture of care and DEIJ . Alumni are surveyed two years and five years after graduation 31 about a broad range of experiences, and these surveys are part of regular, formal outcomes assessment. The Curriculum Committ ee is responsible for the predoctoral program, including evaluating the quality of the program and authorizing changes. The Advanced and Graduate Education Committee has responsibility for the postgraduate programs and for the Master in Dental Science degree. The Outcomes Assessment Committee is generally responsible for evaluating the school's performance, including patient care. The Student Promotion Committee monitors the standing of individual students and oversees course grading policies. Additionally, learning objectives for all of the programs are documented on the school's website. Research and professional development. The D.Sc. and M .S. programs are primarily research programs, but students in other programs are also encouraged to do research. Sum mer stipends are available to predoctoral students. Students may also join the Research Travel Program, in which they go to the headquarters of dental manufacturers to participate in research with industry scientists. In addition to the formal postgraduate programs (Advanced Education Programs ), TUSDM runs a variety of short continuing education courses and mini residencies . The short courses may be online or in person; some are as short as an hour and others are a full day. Mini -residency programs include three , three -day in -person sessions spread through the academic year, coupled with online sessions. School of Medicine (TUSM) TUSM offers the M .D. degree, Master of Public Health (M .P.H.), Master of Biomedical Science (M.B.S.), Master in Health Informatics and Analytics (H .I.A.), and, since their last accreditation, a physician assistant program, equivalent to a master's degree, and the Doctor of Physical Therapy degree (D .P.T.). The M .D. program is separately accredited and submitted its self -study to the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME ) in AY 2022. A Doctor of Public Health (Dr.PH) program was instituted shortly after our last accreditation review but is no longer admitting students. All the degrees except the M .D. are housed within Public Health and Professional Degree ( PHPD ) Programs, a separate administrative unit within TUSM. PHPD programs. The M.P.H. program is delivered both on campus and online, with approximately one-third of students enrolled online. The M.P.H. is a professional degree that provides students with a comprehensive foundation in public health principles and practice while allowing specialization in one of several areas: epidemiology and biostatistics, health services management and policy, and nutrition and population health promotion. Students on campus may participate in a joint degree program, pursuing the M.P.H. with another degree at one of the following schools: TUSM (M.D., Physician Assistant, M .S.-B.S.), Cummings School (D.V.M.), Friedm an (M .S.), Northeastern University ( J.D.), and Boston College ( J.D.). The Dr .PH program, which had begun in 2013, admitted its final student cohort in 2018; seven students remain and are in the process of completing their dissertations. The M.P.H. program is accredited by the Council on Education in Public Health and follows a competency -based curriculum comprising evidenced -based approaches ; health care systems ; planning and management ; policy ; leadership ; communication ; interprofessional practice ; and systems thinking . Accreditation requirements include the following: mission/vision and value statements that define how the program plans to advance the field of public health and promote student success; evaluation metrics; an evaluation plan; inter nal and external stakeholder communication and review; and assessment of instructional effectiveness. Alumni surveys, graduating student surveys, course evaluations, and annual reporting on key metrics generate information used to evaluate success and/or progress. In addition to academic work, all M .P.H. students complete an applied learning experience (ALE) as a capstone , which produces a useful product for their host organization. Many students also participate in research projects, some of which result i n article authorship. 32 The Health Informatics and Analytics (HIA) Program is in its third year of operation and offers a Master of Science (M.S.) to students interested in data collection, assessment, analysis, and application in health care systems. Most HIA students are working in a health -related position, some on the clinical side, and want to develop new technology skills, broaden their understanding of the dramatic advancements made in health informatics, or explore the world of digital health and the possibilities for enhancing opportunities for self - and clinician -managed care. HIA courses are offered online with a combination of asynchronous and live session instruction. All students are required to complete a capstone at a host site consisting of real-world informatics or analytics . The HIA program is one of a few in the country that combine informatics and analytics in the same program. The Physician Assistant Program confers a M .S. in medical science . It is accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC -PA). The first class was admitted in 2013 , and the program received full accreditation in 2016. S tudents matriculate in January for a 25 -month continuous course of study. In the didactic first year, students gain knowledge of the foundations of medical science, pathophysiology of disease, and medical therapeutics . They are introduced to various medical disciplines. Several skills workshops prepare them for the subsequent 12 months in clinical rotations. During the second (clinical) year, students travel within a 60 -mile radius of Boston to clinical practice sites around eastern Massachusetts for rotations of four to five weeks ' duration in core clinical disciplines such as internal medicine, pediatrics, surgery, emergency medicine, women's health, behavioral medicine, family medicine, and orthopedics ; they also choose one elective. In the final weeks of the program, students complete a capstone project, a culminating experience in which they demonstrate their ability to analyze the evidence for or against a clinically relevant hypothesis. The Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences program is a special master's degree that prepares students for entrance into schools of medicine ( M.D.), osteopathic medicine (D .O.), or dentistry (D.M.D. ). Most of its students are seeking entrance to medical school ; the program achieves more than 80 percent success. The program enrolled its first class in August 2010. The curriculum mirrors a portion of the first year of medical school at Tufts, requiring courses in microbiology, cell biology, medical histology, biochemistry, immunology, clinical medicine, physiology, nutrition, human anatomy, medical genetics, pharmacology, and basic human pathology . A library - or laboratory -based thesis, completed under the guidance of a thesis advisor, is required of all students. As of January 2023, two Doctor of Physical Therapy ( D.P.T. ) programs are pursuing accreditation by CAPTE and have received candidacy status. The D.P.T. program in Boston began in January 2021, and a second program in Phoenix launched in June 2022. In addition, hiring is underway for a third program to be reviewed for candidacy in December 2023, with a launch dat e of August 2024 planned. The programs are hybrid, with interactive virtual courses, eight onsite clinical skill lab sessions of eight to 12 days, and 31 weeks of clinical education. Didactic coursework and clinical experiences are integrated, as students do them concurrently. The program lasts 27 months. The curriculum includes basic science, applied science, leadership and professional development, critical inquiry, and patient and practice management courses. Learning assessment . Each program has a facu lty-led curriculum review committee. The frequency of committee meetings depends on the specific program, ranging from once a semester to monthly. The nature of the reviews is specific to the program and typically involve s teaching faculty and student feedback, preceptor and external advisory group feedback, and survey results. The Public Health and Professional Degrees ( PHPD ) programs are overseen by the dean for PHPD, with input from the Program Directors Committee , which sets academic policies, reviews a cademic issues common across two or more programs affecting the student learning experience , and makes recommendations to the dean. Academic oversight is the purview of individual programs. Faculty assess the curriculum and student learning experience. The Public Health Academic Affairs Committee oversees all the PHPD programs, including public healt h, and the C urriculum Committee is responsible for the Biomedical Sciences Program. 33 A recent strategic planning process recommended bringing the three public health -related programs more closely together through a review of their committee structures. In preparation for the first five - year review of the M .S. in biomedical sciences ( M.B.S. ), a self -study process was established in consultation with the program director and the M.B.S. Steering Committee. Internal assessment in collaboration with TUSM also le d the faculty to establish a physician assistant training program. The program has achieved Provisional Accreditation status from the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for Physician Assistants, and a self -study process was established in consult ation with the program director and the Physician Assistant Steering Committee in preparation for the first three -year review of the M.B.S. conferred to students in that program. Research and professional development. TUSM students are encouraged to conduct research and can even be granted the M.D. with research honors if they have spent a significant amount of time in research and made real contributions. The Student Research Concentration allows students to interrupt their ordinary program and spend six to 12 months working full time on a research project, normally after the third year of the M.D. program. Research fellowships are also available for students between the first and second year for shorter -term projects, typically eight weeks. Students in the M .P.H. program may join faculty research projects, and both the Health Informatics program and the Physician Assistant ( P.A.) program offer research capstone projects. Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) GSBS (renamed from \"Sackler\" in 2019) trains biomedical scientists to be future leaders in research, teaching, biotechnology, and other science -based careers with emphasis on interdisciplinary training that integrates state -of-the-art approaches t o basic and clinical sciences and on research training directed toward solving disease - and health -related problems. GSBS brings together faculty from across the schools. Student research makes major contributions to the overall research mission of the biomedical scientists with whom they train. There were 180 degree -seeking students enrolled in AY 2020-2021. While GSBS is housed at TUSM , which provides its budget, it enrolls students across Tufts , including from A&S, SOE , and Cummings School , and partners at Jackson Laboratories and Maine Medical Center. GSBS offers training in five basic science doctoral programs, decreased from eight since our last accreditation review: Cell, Molecular & Developmental Biology; Genetics; Immunology; Molecular Microbiology ; and Neuroscience. Students who complete significant training but elect not to finish the Ph.D. may be awarded an M.S. from these programs. The changes were due to several programs fusing, and one converted to a master's program (Pharmacology and Experime ntal Therapeutics became Pharmacology and Drug Development). GSBS also has a Clinical and Translational Sciences program that offers Ph.D. and master's degrees, primarily to people who already hold an M.D. and wish to conduct and translate research into im proved clinical care and public health. Finally, GSBS has an M.D. -Ph.D. program funded by NIH for which trainees complete the Ph.D. portion of their training in one of the basic science programs. An essential aspect of training is thesis work under the men torship of GSBS faculty. A recent change has been to provide mentor training, including culturally aware mentoring, through the NIH Center for Improvement of Mentored Experience in Research. GSBS partners with Jackson Lab in Bar Harbor, Maine to run two o f the Ph.D. programs, the ones in genetics and neuroscience. Students interact with faculty at both Bar Harbor and Boston through synchronous, hybrid courses, and students can choose to perform research in either Bar Harbor or Boston. Students complete the same curriculum as the respective program in Boston. Learning assessment. The bylaws of GSBS require that all programs be reviewed at five -year intervals. An ad hoc committee is formed that includes two program directors, an additional Tufts faculty member (not at GSBS) , and two outside members who are expert s in the program field. The Committee on Programs and Faculty, a standing faculty committee, is entrusted with conducting these reviews and 34 making recommendations to the GSBS Executive Council. Program directors respond to the reviews, which are then discussed and voted on by the Executive Cou ncil. Didactic courses are reviewed via student course evaluations every time they are offered. Journal Club courses are reviewed via student course evaluations annually ( at the end of spring term). There are standard questionnaires (one for didactic cours es, one for Journal Club courses) that are used (online through the Student Information System ). The dean and program directors discuss any poor course evaluations with course directors. Research and professional development. The major mission of GSBS is training its students to be excellent, rigorous biomedical scientists. Original research is central to this. Ph.D. theses are assessed based on their contribution to filling an important gap in knowledge; they usually result in a first author publication i n a leading journal. Master 's programs also have a thesis requirement, though the bar is somewhat lower. In recent years, there has been marked growth in opportunities for career exploration and development , including opportunities for industrial internshi ps, mentoring circles, courses taught by alumni on communities of practice, and a career strategist to advise students. Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine (Cummings School ) The mission of Cummings School is to serve Massachusetts, New England, and bey ond by providing outstanding veterinary and graduate education that prepares students to excel in diverse careers; developing and delivering innovative, state -of-the-art veterinary care for domestic and wild animals; discovering and applying new knowledge and innovations that help achieve health and well -being for all species; and fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community and profession. The school offers a D.V.M. program, a Ph.D. in biomedical sciences, and master's degrees in animals and pub lic policy, conservation medicine, and infectious disease and global health. The D.V.M. can also be combined with a master's in laboratory animal medicine offered by the school or with the master's in public health offered by TUSM. The Curriculum Committee , a standing committee of the faculty, is responsible for \"educational policy and evaluating the quality, effectiveness, and breadth of the veterinary curriculum\" (Bylaws, p. 9), including specific courses. The Advanced Education Committee has similar responsibility for the M .S. and Ph.D. programs and certificate programs, including establishing or terminating programs. No new programs have been added since the last accreditation visit in 2013. Continuing education and pre -college programs. Cummings School offers internship (one year) and residency (generally three years) programs for veterinarians who want broader experience, or who seek board certification in a specialized field. Residents have the opportunity to do research and to teach i nterns and D.V.M. students. Additionally, Cummings School offers continuing education programs and professional development opportunities for practicing veterinarians and for veterinary technicians. These programs may be online, in person, or a combination ; they include hands -on labs, seminars, and lecturers. The school also offers formal and informal programs for community members and for pre -college students. The Adventures in Veterinary Medicine programs (middle school, high school, college, or adult) ex pose their students to veterinary medicine and let them learn about animal health. Cummings School also works with several Massachusetts high schools to provide enrichment opportunities for biology students. Learning assessment. The D.V.M. program is accr edited by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA ) Council on Education and meets all the Council's standards. Accreditation was renewed in March 2019 for seven years. Students take the North American Veterinary Licensing Examination at the end o f the program and, in the past five years, have had a 99.8 percent pass rate (468 of 469 students passing from 2017 -2021). The school's 2030 Strategic Vision pledges the delivery of exceptional education. It strives to provide \"a dynamic learning environm ent providing accessible education that prepares our students and advanced trainees to collectively have a profound impact on veterinary medicine and One Health.\" The school is currently redesigning its D.V.M. curriculum to meet the current and future need s of students and the profession. 35 Research and professional development. D.V.M. students are encouraged to do research. A summer program gives funding to students finishing their first or second year, to work on research projects with faculty mentors in a ny department. The program includes seminar presentations by veterinarians working in biomedical research, whether in universities or in biotech companies. External funding is also available through grants from the Boehringer Ingelheim Veterinary Scholars program and the Morris Animal Foundation. The Residents Enhanced Veterinary Education and Academic Learning (REVEAL ) program, developed with support from an NIH education grant, is intended to attract veterinary residents to academic or research careers. S tudents work with mentors, take short elective courses, meet with researchers in other fields, and perform research. University College (UC) Part of UC's original design was that it would facilitate and co -coordinate interdisciplinary degree programs involving several Tufts schools. The Standing Committee on University -Wide Degree Programs of University College will supervise degree programs offered by UC, though there are no such programs at present. More important so far has been the UC Standing Committee on Non-Degree Programs, which approves courses and programs available through UC but not connected to a UC degree or certificate. Nearly all courses off ered to nonmatriculated students through UC are existing Tufts courses, or content taken from those courses, taught, or at least developed, by Tufts faculty and graduate students. Workshops, courses, certificates, or programs (credit -bearing or noncredit ) may be proposed to the UC faculty for development. Offerings for credit in partnership with one of the other schools are submitted for approval to the school's own curriculum committee. The three main areas of activity are pre -college programs, the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, and professional and continuing education. Pre -college programs, mostly for high school students , though some also admit younger children, run year -round, with residential programs available in the summer. UC runs some of these programs itself and runs others in collaboration with A&S, SMFA, SOE, TUSM, Friedman, and Tisch. Some offer college credit while others are noncredit , cocurricular experiences. In 2020 -21, the Osher program had 954 members taking noncredit courses (\"study groups\") taught by Tufts alumni, current faculty, retired faculty, and Osher members. The program is self -governing through volunteer committees of its members. UC offers continuing ed ucation through the Courses at Tufts program, in which nonmatriculated students may enroll in regular Tufts courses alongside matriculated students. Courses from A&S, SMFA, SOE , Fletcher, Friedman, GSBS, and TUSM are available, and there were 916 enrollmen ts in 2020 -21. As these are existing Tufts courses, they are a pproved and monitored by their home schools. UC administers the SMFA continuing education program as well, which offers credit -bearing and noncredit courses and workshops year -round to nonmatric ulated students and working professionals. UC also manages the Tufts Summer Session, open to matriculated Tufts students, students from other colleges (who may wish to transfer credit to their home institutions), and nonmatriculated Tufts students. Course s from A&S, SMFA, SOE , Fletcher, Friedman, GSBS, and TUSM are available, and there were a total of 3,148 enrollments in 2020 -21, of which 916 were nonmatriculated students. Tisch College (Tisch) In 2016, as part of a strategic planning process, the Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service was renamed to Tisch College of Civic Life. As the strategic plan explains, \"we all are engaged in civic life when we organize and debate, when we serve, and when we advocate and act on the issues that affect us.\" Although Tisch does not have its own faculty, it brings in faculty from across the university through its Tisch Faculty Fellows program. Tisch supports the service -learning programs of TUSM, TUSDM, Cummings School , and Friedman, giving professional students an opportunity for transformational experiences in their communities. Most 36 of the academic programming of Tisch is aimed at undergraduates. The Civic Semester and the 1+4 Bridge Program give newly admitted under graduates a structured gap year (or gap semester) of service learning. The 1+4 program has been suspended during the pandemic; the Civic Semester has continued. The Tisch Scholars program is a leadership development program for undergraduates combining fieldwork with an academic course. Students may spend up to three years in the program. In the first year they work on a research or service project with a community organization and participate in the fieldwork seminar for credit each semester. In the seco nd and third years, they take on more responsibility and join more -complex projects. Skill -building workshops, networking events, and social events are also part of the program. Students who continue for three years do a capstone project, which may be deve loped with a community partner or as a senior honors thesis with a faculty member. Tisch runs the civic studies major in A&S, offered as a second major only. This program includes several new courses in civic studies , beginning with an introductory course , required for the major. All of these courses, and the major itself, were approved by the A&S Committee on Curricula and the A&S faculty. Most of the courses in the Civic Studies program come from A&S departments and programs (such as political science, s ociology, mathematics, Romance studies, and so on). Students may also minor in peace and justice studies or in entrepreneurship for social impact, and these programs are also run by the Civic Studies program faculty. The research activities of Tisch inclu de projects studying students' civic engagement and well -being, and the results are used to help improve the Civic Studies program's courses and curriculum. PROJECTION: GOALS AND PLANS Since the last accreditation Tufts has developed additional 4+1 master 's programs and new professional programs. We have added SMFA as a prestigious art school, integrated into the university . Additionally, we have maintained our identity as a Carnegie R1 institution with a student focus. Nonetheless, we recognize challenges . Growth in the student body means we may be exceeding capacity in some programs, as faculty time, studio and laboratory space, classroom space, and student housing are all restricted. Increasing the compositional diversity of the student body and of the f aculty is a major goal, as is making a Tufts education more affordable. We observe a shift in how current students perceive the value of higher education, undergraduate or graduate. While traditional bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees will still b e essential for Tufts, we project a growth in unbundled course offerings or certificate programs , where the focus will be on attaining competencies that students can use for career advancement or career change. As we increase our capacity for hybrid and on line courses, and the faculty's comfort in teaching them, we expect growth, including making more courses available to students who may prefer online to residential programs (such as international students, economically challenged students, or students working full time). At the same time, students in the traditional degree programs increasingly demand opportunities for experiential learning, career exploration, and professional development. Finally, lowering the barriers to higher education for underrep resented groups is a major goal for Tufts, whether those barriers are financial or cultural. We must increase the diversity of our student body to better reflect the diversity of the nation and the world we serve. Our projections, goals, and plans are grouped into the four main areas of integration, interdisciplinarity, and cross -school programs; lifelong learning; experiential learning and professional development; and inclusion , and justice (DEIJ) . Integration, Interdisciplina rity, and Cross -School Programs As our schools are spread across four campuses and our administrative organization is decentralized , it has been difficult for faculty in different schools to work together, whether on research or on cross - 37 school degrees. The exc eptions so far involve schools on the same campus, such as the joint Ph.D. program between Fletcher and Economics in A&S, the M .S. program between Fletcher and computer science in SOE , the M.D. /Ph.D. program between TUSM and GSBS, or the programs in cognit ive science (graduate and undergraduate) between A&S and SOE . There are other opportunities for cross - school degrees, though. For example, the One Health program in the Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, currently primarily a research program, could be a natural starting point for a degree crossing Cummings School, TUSM, TUSDM, Fletcher, A&S, and other schools. The study of the environment, ecology, and climate change also spans most Tufts schools , and a cross -disciplinary degree program here wo uld certainly attract students. Although U C was intended to provide a framework for degrees spanning more than two schools, no such degrees are currently being planned. Even without formal cross -school degree programs, though, it ought to be easier for students to take advantage of resources outside their home schools: cross -registering for classes, participating in research, perhaps earning minors (undergraduate) or certificates (graduate) to go along with their primary degrees. As Tufts increase s the n umber of online or hybrid courses, and with a new subway stop on the Medford campus, the geographic spread of campuses should become less of a barrier. In addition to concurrent dual -degree, combined degree, or cross -school programs, there are sequential programs. Many A&S and SOE graduate departments have \"4+1\" programs (marketed as \"Tufts Plus\"), allowing undergraduates to stay on for a fifth year to finish a master's degree. There is a similar program between the undergraduate schools and the Fletcher school, though it is little used. The health sciences schools offer early assurance of admission to Tufts undergraduates. These programs could be better publicized, and perhaps students could start their professional degree concurrently with the l ast undergraduate year, as is possible for the A&S B .A.+M.A. programs. Lifelong Learning Although all Tufts schools have some sort of continuing education programming, it was not until the creation of UC that Tufts began to look at them systematically. Th e Courses at Tufts program generalizes arrangements that had existed before for nonmatriculated students to register for courses without being in any sort of degree program. Students can now take any of several certificate programs, smaller building blocks that might eventually be part of a degree or might simply be continuing education, whether for career development or for enrichment. Additionally, Tufts, like other universities, is adding certificate programs as alternatives to full -scale master's degree s, particularly in Friedman and SOE . Some of these courses are offered online, providing flexibility for students. There is also value to the residential experience, however . The diversity gained from having retirees, active workers considering a career ch ange, and other different groups all in the same class can benefit all students. Experiential Learning and Professional Development Most of our schools are professional schools, giving students the skills and foundational knowledge they need for a particu lar set of careers, whether it be creating art, the practice of medicine, or policymaking in a foreign affairs office. But even undergraduates in the liberal arts are thinking ahead to possible careers. It is appropriate for the university to give all stud ents the opportunity to explore possible careers \u2014whether narrowly in the context of a professional degree or more broadly for undergraduates \u2014and to get some actual experience in the world outside the university. Thus, we hope to increase opportunities for internship s in industry, government, NGOs, arts organizations, and the like, both in the U.S. and abroad. Some programs accept internships for academic credit. SOE has been in the lead here, but other schools, notably GSBS, are increasing their offerings. This is also a natural place of growth for Tisch, which can help students find ways to engage in civic and citizenship activities or in activism. Tisch already funds summer internships for undergraduates in government, public policy, and community organizations. 38 The Notation of Development certificate given by GSAS and SOE graduate programs to st udents who complete a series of professional development workshops could be expanded to other schools; this notation appears on a student's transcript and is thus part of the permanent record. At present the schools maintain separate career offices ; these could perhaps share resources and make workshops available more broadly. For example, undergraduates considering medical school might want to consult the TUSM career center about what would come after the M.D. A&S, however, does not want to lose the broa d liberal arts program, which is not intended to train students for a particular career but to introduce them to many ways of thinking and being in the world. A&S graduates should be prepared not only for their first jobs but also for careers that may not have even existed when they matriculated. Foreign language skills are important to global citizens, as are analytical reading, lucid writing, and some facility with statistics. Undergraduate research can be at least as useful as an internship in preparing students for an unpredictable future. Diversity, Equity, Inclusion , and Justice (DEIJ) Tufts is committed to being an anti -racist and diverse institution and to that end is continuously advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, healing, and justice for the Tufts community and beyond. We have already mentioned the compositional diversity of the student body. There are also ongoing efforts to continue to diversify the composition of the faculty and staff and to focus on the additional dimension of diversity t hat the continuing education population of students might bring. Many schools have expanded scholarship budgets to reduce barriers to attendance for accepted underrepresented students. Diversity also includes socioeconomic diversity, and the high cost of attending Tufts is a barrier. Fundraising for financial aid continues to be a priority of the university. Financial aid for summer courses has doubled this year, an important component of retention efforts. Schools are also continuing to expand outreach efforts and other programs to attract diverse students. As part of the current initiative to make Tufts an anti -racist institution, we are also considering the place of DEIJ in the curriculum itself. The university plans to institute effective education for every member of the Tufts community to drive anti -racist attitudes, values, and behaviors and has recently approved a university -wide anti -racism and anti -oppression train ing in addition to implicit bias training. As part of the university -wide efforts, we are establishing consistent anti -racist definitions and language. Within the Center for Enhancement of Teaching and Learning ( CELT ) there are various offerings, trainings , and resources to support DEIJ efforts within the curriculum at all schools. For example, there is an Anti - Racist Teaching Faculty Learning Community, and CELT hosts book groups, workshops, and retreats related to DEIJ. All faculty members are encouraged to develop a teaching philosophy statement for their courses , including a DEIJ section that can be included in their syllabi or course materials. Anti - racist teaching resources to improve classroom teaching include the use of inclusive language, ungrading, and participatory instruction. TUSDM has led the way , with a focus for its students on a culturally competent practice. At Fletcher, all faculty have been encouraged to review their syllabi to ensure diversity of perspectives and have been given support for doing this. In the A&S undergraduate programs, DEIJ in the curriculum may include study of societies different from one's own, and study of the history of slavery and racism in the U.S. Such courses could be made available to students in other Tufts sc hools as well. Other schools will formulate their own ways to bring DEIJ into their curricula. With its emphasis on reaching new student populations, UC puts DEIJ at the center of its mission , and building more scholarship support is a priority. An NIH grant at TUSM has increased access to the pre - college Mini -Med School program and to a new dual -enrollment course in immunology. Tisch is developing external support for its pre -college Leadership fo r Social Change program . 39 Standard 5: Student s In pursuit of the university mission , Tufts attracts students from every possible background with every kind of talent. These individuals come together to forge a community of scholars, artists, and innovators, where each person is supported in their unique pursuits and where we all find strength in the shared purpose of active citizenship and addressing the world's greatest challenges. As described in the Institutional Overview, Tufts serves approximately 12,000 students from more than 130 countries on four main campuses . Basic race/ethnicity and gender breakdowns are as follows , with more detail found at Diversity Data . 40 The student population is primarily full time as shown below, with more details available in the Tufts Factbook . 41 Undergraduate Full -time/Part -time Student Graduate/Professional Full-time/Part -time Student Enrollment Fall 2021 Full Time Part Time Total Graduate 3,382 1,001 4,383 Professional 2,089 4 2,093 Nondegree 5,477 1,100 6,602 *Nondegree -seeking students are enrolled in courses but are not enrolled in a degree program. One of the characteristics that defines Tufts is our ethos as a very high research activity university that has the soul of a residential liberal arts college. Consistent with that eth os, we strive to create a holistic, community -based student experience where students learn and create new things, test boundaries, and take intellectual risks, confident that they are seen and cared about as an individual, that faculty and staff want to m entor them, and that their peers will encourage them rather than compete with them. Five of the most important themes of the student experience at Tufts are community building; DEIJ; developing life skills; mental health; and civic engagement. This cha pter will focus primarily, though not exclusively, on the student experience in A&S (which includes SMFA at Tufts) and SOE (collectively, AS&E). These two schools enroll 100 percent of the undergraduate students and about 40 percent of graduate and professional students at Tufts. Several of the other schools that enroll only graduate and professional students receive program -specific accreditation that cover s the same areas; see the Work Room Documents f or the program -specific self - studies. DESCRIPTION Admissions and Financial Aid Fundamental to our purpose is bringing students from all walks of life to Tufts through the admissions process. Each of Tufts ' schools manages their recruitment and admissions slightly differently, but they each have the goal of recruiting, attracting, and enrolling an exceptionally talented, diverse, and community -oriented pool of st udents. Tufts' schools each maintain individual admission websites and easily accessible virtual resources. Blogs, social media, viewbooks, magazines, and newsletters are used across schools, and virtual versions of tours, information sessions, and facult y or student panels have proliferated in the COVID -19 era, expanding access to information to a greater swath of prospective students. Each school elevates themes or areas of emphasis in their promotional efforts that distinguish their focus or culture. Ac ross Tufts ' schools, those themes often include civic engagement, social justice, collaboration, international identity, and a strong sense of community. To varying degrees, those themes contribute to a holistic application review process \u2014that is, schools select applicants from competitive pools who will contribute to these themes. See Work Room Documents Standard 5-1 for detailed information about each school's recruitment. In 2021, Tufts made a commitment to increase the compositional diversity of the student body. To that end, each school works to enroll a diverse student body from the pool of qualified applicants , not only in race and ethnicity but also in geography, culture, socioeconomic status, interests, special talents, and 42 international experience. As part of this commitment, each school has updated their recruitment and selection processes to prov ide greater access and equity to our admissions processes for students from all backgrounds. All schools adhere to Tufts' comprehensive nondiscrimination policy to provide equal opportunity and equal treatment of every prospective student. The cost of a Tufts education is significant. Tufts guarantees that all undergraduates will have 100 percent of their demonstrated financial need met by financial aid packages, even if those needs increase during their enrollment; there is no parallel guarantee for graduate students. Tufts awards need -based financial aid to about 45 percent of undergraduate students , while 55 percent receive no aid. For undergraduates who do receive aid, the average amount awarded is just over $ 50,000. Most of the aid awarded is through grants, scholarships, or tuition remission; only 14 percent is loans. Information about financial aid, including eligibility criteria and application procedures, is posted to the Tufts website and provided during recruitment and admissions . Twenty -seven percent of undergraduate students, 34 percent of graduate students, and 72 percent of professional students graduate with loan debt. See Data First Form , Standard 5.3, \" Financial Aid, Debt, Developmental Courses \" and Tufts University Fact Book 2020 -21, \"Financial Aid from Tufts,\" (pp. 40-44) for details. Transition to Tufts After students are admitted to Tufts, the work of transitioning them to university life begins. The transition period is critical because it is a n opportunity to begin building community, meet students where they are, develop life skills, promote mental health, and offer opportunities for civic engagement. At the undergraduate level, pre-orientation and orientation are signature programs that contribute significantly to the overall student experience. Pre -orientation gives students the choice of participating in one of eight optional programs right before orientation . These program s are designed to build community by allowing students to meet people who have shared interests in civic engagement, recreational activities, faith, art, or other topics. Approximately 65 percent of new undergraduate students participate in one of the pre -orientation programs annually. Orientation is required for all new undergraduates. Content during this week -long event is wide ranging and include s social programs to build community, academic events to acclimate students to the curriculum and academic sup port resources, and student life topics like DEIJ , alcohol and drug education, mental health and wellness, and sexual assault prevention and bystander intervention. Overall, pre -orientation and undergraduate orientation are well received. See Work Room Doc uments Standard 5-2 for more information. At the graduate and professional student level, common sessions during orientation include curriculum overviews, sexual misconduct training, DEIJ programming, health and wellness programming, general student support, community service opportunities, group bonding activities, and optional fun activities. New graduate students who are taking on roles as teaching assistants or research assistants are generally given training specific to those roles. Residential Experience Living on campus is one of the signature experiences of a Tufts education for undergraduates. We value the residential component of the Tufts experience highly because it is the foundation used to create community and a sense of belonging. Most graduate an d professional students never live on campus. First-year and sophomore students are required to live on campus. Junior, senior, and graduate students are eligible to participate in a housing lottery to secure on -campus housing. About 4,100 students live o n the Medford or Fenway campuses, which represents about 62 percent of undergraduates and 1 percent of AS&E graduate students. A variety of housing styles are offered, from traditional residence hall style with common -area bathroom s and double rooms, to suites and apartments, to small two - or three -story houses or brownstones. Almost all on -campus housing is on the M edford/Somerville campus; there are three residence halls with 81 beds near the Fenway campus for SMFA students. Each residential community is staffed with resident assistants (peer mentors) and 43 professional staff who are focused on providing residential e ducation, facilitating social connection, and offering paraprofessional support. The residential life program is a core part of the learning experience for undergraduates. All first -year students are assigned a roommate and placed in a community made up o f exclusively first -year students. This maximizes the possibility that student s have learning and growth experience s on campus, build meaningful community with peers, and interact with someone who has a different life experience from their own . Sophomores form their own groups and select into their on -campus housing assignment with their chosen peers. Juniors and above participate in a lottery to live in one of the approximately 900 upper -class beds. A number of special interest and theme housing option s, including identity -based housing and fraternity and sorority housing, are also offered to upper -class students. Forty -five beds are designated for graduate students. Most students who live on campus report satisfactio n and learning from their on -campus living experience. See Work Room Documents Standard 5-3 for survey results. Demand for on -campus housing consistently exceeded supply even before recent increases in student enrollment, which have exacerbated the housing shortage. In 2021 -22, Tufts leased space in a nearby hotel for about 100 first -year students due to an unanticipated increase in enrollment. For 2022 -23, Tufts built temporary modular units to house about 160 students unable to be accommodated in existing residence halls. The number of beds in the housing system has increased by about 450 (12 percent ) since 2016, and projects are currently in the planning phases to bring more than 500 additional beds online by 2027, including the construction of a n ew high -density residence hall on campus. Several improvements to existing residential facilities have been made recently. Metcalf and Stratton Halls were renovated in 2018. Houston Hall and Miller Hall were renovated in 2019. The creation of CoHo in 2018 -19 brought 14 renovated wood frame houses online for junior and senior student apartment -style living. Still, the need for more on -campus housing is pressing. About 38 percent of undergraduates \u2014all of whom are juniors and seniors \u2014and almost all graduate students live off -campus. Most undergraduates live within the immediate vicinity of campus and still feel the campus area is their home \u2014they walk to class and spend time during the day on campus. Graduate student living circumstances are more varied; some l ive in apartments or homes near campus while others commute significant distances. Tufts provides limited resources and support to students living off campus so that they can find housing, receive education about their rights and responsibilities as tenants, and be good neighbors in the communities of which Tufts is a part. The cost of rental housing throughout the greater Boston area is high. This leads to challenges for stud ents living off campus, particularly for graduate students. See Work Room Documents Standard 5-3 for a discussion of some of the challenges related to graduate students and affordability of off -campus housing. Neighbors and elected officials in Medford and Somerville have called on Tufts to build more on-campus housing for undergraduate students. Additional on -campus housing is needed to meet demand from existing students. As enrollment increases, even more housing will be needed to accommodate the larger student population. Student Leadership, Student Activities, Student Organizations Tufts enc ourages student governance, student organizations, and student activities as an essential way for students to create their own Tufts experience and learn life skills like leadership, advocacy, and creating their own social and recreational opportunities. T he university's role in these groups varies but is generally limited to advising and providing logistical support; part of the key way these programs generate student learning and community is by being student led. Students make all the decisions about the ir activities, budgets, operations, and purpose. The Tufts Community Union (TCU) is the student government group representing all undergraduates. Its members are elected by the undergraduate student body annually. All undergraduate students pay a student activity fee annually; 100 percent of the approximately $2. 3 million collected by that fee goes to TCU, which in turns allocates it to hosting major concerts and social events, funding the budget of 44 student organizations, and sponsoring student initiatives. In addition to allocating this money, TCU advocates for undergraduate interests and lobbies the administration. To further represent student voice in university decisions, TCU appoints student representatives to the primary committees of the Board of Trustees and to the faculty committees deal ing with student issues, including the Committee on Student Life . TCU manages the student organization recognitio n system, deciding which student groups should have university recognition. Graduate and professional students are represented by school -specific student government. For example, Fletcher students elect eight students yearly to serve on the Fletcher Stude nt Council; AS&E graduate students are represented by the Graduate Student Council; and GSBS has a Graduate Student Council with representatives from each academic program. In addition to each school's student council, most graduate student bodies elect students to serve on standing faculty, school, or university - wide committees. Another way that students lead and shape life on campus is with their civic engagement. Tufts is known for attracting students who want to make positive change in the world. Our achievement of the Carnegie Community Engagement classification demonstrates that civic engagement is a university - wide cult ural value that permeates academics and student life. Students are known for robust activism around campus and societal issues, from unionization of dining staff and divestment from fossil fuels to American immigration policy and climate change. Students also regularly lead voting initiatives , perform fellowships serving the community, paint the cannon (a campus tradition) with political policy -related messages, participate in political campaigns, and receive awards for their civic engagement. Student organizations are a major part of the experience for students at Tufts. A student's social life is often directly related to their student organization involvement or through ge neral participation and attendance at student organization events. Students being responsible for student programming is a way students direct their own campus experience and create a culture on campus; students have direct ownership over program planning and implementation. TCU recognizes approximately 330 student organizations ; approximately 10 to 15 new student organizations are recognized each year. Opportunities for leadership experiences within the student organization system are immense and varied, and the breadth of organization is strik ing and showcases the creativity of Tufts students \u2014there are cultural clubs, award -winning a cappella groups that tour nationally, political organizations, literary magazine collectives, and academically affiliated professional societies. The student membe rs of the Tufts University Social Collective plan and present major social events every year, including film series, late-night programs, comedy shows, and major concerts. As a testament to the civic engagement of students, one of the largest student organizations at Tufts is the Leonard Carmichael Society , which is a public servi ce group in which over 1,000 students per year perform service in areas such as literacy, homelessness, and food insecurity. Tufts Mountain Club is a large and popular s tudent organization in which students organize wilderness excursions, operate a cabin in the White Mountains in New Hampshire, and teach other students about outdoor events. Through student organizations, hundreds of programs are offered annually , represen ting the wide variety of student interests. Leadership in student organizations often falls to underclass students because about 40 percent of undergraduates study abroad during their junior year and do not \"reconnect\" with leadership activities in student organizations upon return. Each graduate and professional school has a more limited offering of student organizations and activities. Most schools have professional or academically focused student clubs, affinity groups, and groups that are for recreation . Athletics, Physical Education, Recreation , and Fitness For many students, participation in athletics, recreation , and fitness activities is a very important part of their overall student experience at Tufts. Tufts Athletics offers 30 varsity sports (800 participants), 28 club sports (> 1,000 participants), and eight intramural leagues (> 1,000 participants). The department also offers a variety of physical education and activity classes, including general fitness, yoga, meditation, mindfulness, swimming, spinning , and rock climbing. Graduate students on the Medford campus participate in intramural programs and are frequent users of Tufts' fitness facilities . Other 45 graduate schools operate satellite fitness centers and sponsor student -initiated recreational sports teams. Consistent with the mission of Tufts and the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), Tufts is committed to ensuring that varsity athletes focus on academic interests and have the opportunity to enjoy a broad and balanced student experience. Student -athletes access academic and other support services (e.g., academic support services, financial aid, etc.) in the same manner as other students. Tufts does not permit varsity teams to participate in out -of-season athletic activities (with limited exceptions during the pandemic for mental health and physical fitness reasons) so that student -athletes have the same freed om as other students to study abroad and explore a wide array of academic, social, and extracurricular activities. Starting with the 2021 -22 academic year, the president's office has direct oversight of the Department of Athletics (for the previous six yea rs, Athletics reported to the provost's office ). To ensure proper fiscal controls, the athletics budget, expenditures, and financial operations are managed by a variety of offices and are regularly audited by Tufts Audit and Advisory Services. In addition to their many competitive successes on the field of play, the Tufts student -athletes have excelled in the classroom. Their cumulative GPA has increased steadily over the last five years , from 3.37 to 3.62, which puts them on par with or slightly ahead of the student body. Regularly among the leaders of Academic All -NESCAC Awards (442 last year), the Jumbos are heavily represented on the Dean's List and consistently receive national recogn ition for their academic achievements. Much more information about the academic, community engagement , and athletic successes of the varsity and club sports teams can be found in the Tufts Athletics Annual Reports . Several important facility upgrades have occurred over the last several years, including a new field hockey facility ( Ounjian Field ), a new Tufts Squash Center , and the addition of synthetic turf and lights to Ellis Oval . Several other facilities need repair or replacement, including Hamilton Pool . Student Services Tufts University develops and maintains several forms of student services, all of which support the institution 's spirit and intent of its commitment to equal opportunity and DEIJ goals. Tufts' commitment to becoming an anti -racist institution has significant implications for the student experience and the services that are offered to students. Services to support students' academic and pers onal development are robust and targeted to students' needs. Meeting students where they are and allowing them to choose which services are helpful to them is a critical way that we promote each student 's ability to learn in their own way. In AS&E and Fle tcher, the Student Accessibility and Academic Resource Center (StAAR Center) supports students in academic coaching, time management, tutoring, and writing support through interactive work/life workshops. The StAAR Center also works with students who register disabilities to provide accommodations and promotes a universal design concept in learning as well as in physical facilities. Approximately 20 percent of AS&E and Fletcher students request accessibility accommodations per year; the most common requests are related to mental and chronic health disabilities, which is an exponential change from five years ago, when learning disabilities were the predominant disability. Most students registering for disability -related support are also navigating more than one type of disability. Unique among peer institutions is the number of highly visible identity centers offering services to students. The Africana Center , Asian Amer ican Center , Center for STEM Diversity , Indigenous Center FIRST Center , Latinx Center , LGBT Center , and Women's Center each have robust programming, multiple full -time staff members, and high -profile physical locations. Several centers sponsor theme houses in the residence halls; others offer p re-orientation programs, sponsor related student organizations, or partner with related academic departments. Each center strives to create a community for all undergraduate and graduate students interested in thinking about social identities and the ways 46 they impact our lives and our world. They offer students programs, events, discussion, and leadership on issues of identity, diversity, and social justice. Through the FIRST Center and the Center for STEM Diversity, Tufts operates two successful summer bri dge programs for incoming first -generation undergraduate students ( BLAST for A&S students and BEST for SOE students). Additionally, the International Center supports all of Tufts' international students through programming such as orientations, welcome events, and other programs supporting international student inclusion and integration with Tufts; individual advising and mentoring; and more. Tufts has begun to respond to graduate students' call for more services by creating graduate student - specific set of programs, including work -life-school balance programs, graduate writing retreats, and language circles. For example, TUSDM has multiple programs and services designed for students' success in achieving the ir educational goals, including tutoring and teaching assistants for students. Still, more integrated support needs to be provided in order meet the current needs of our graduate student population. Working at an on - or off -campus job can provide life skills, mentorship, and can help increase career readiness. About 75 percent of undergraduates work for pay for at least one year of their Tufts career; about 26 percent work for pay all four years. A bout half of undergraduates only work one job at a time, and a quarter of students work multiple jobs at once. Around 70 percent of the student s who work have an on-campus job; students are more likely to work off campus later in their career. Finally, each student -facing office at Tufts has embraced a multidimensional outreach approach by creating informative websites and maintaining an active presence on various social media platforms to spread resource information widely and intentionally. Th e Student Life website is being completely redesigned; the new edition has had a soft launch in 2022, with work to be continued through the 2022 - 23 academic year. Academic an d Career Advising Tufts provides extensive resources in academic and career advising at both the graduate and undergraduate level. At the undergraduate level, our comprehensive academic advising program provides students with guidance around course selection, major exploration, and major declaration, as well as supporting students who experience academic difficulty. Most undergraduates start their career with a pre -major advisor who is either a faculty or a staff member, and then transition to a major advisor once they have declared a major. After declaring a major, each student selects a faculty member in their major department to serve as their advisor. Along with course selection, major advisors guide students on potential career paths and the internships, networking, and employment opportunities available in their field. At the graduate level, most students have a single faculty academic advisor throughout their program who provides mentoring in the field and is a general point of connection to Tufts. AS&E students may connect with the Tufts Career Center , which provides support that begins with career exploration and self -assessment and continues to internships, jobs, and beyond. The Career Center also advises students on decis ion making and applications to graduate school and professional school. Over the last 10 years, the Career Center has expanded its staffing across schools to provide the highest level of service to all students. See Data First Form , Standard 8.3, for infor mation on career outcomes of students and Work Room Documents Standard 5-4 for further details about career services. Ethical Guidelines and Cond uct Part of building a community is establishing shared values and norms. To that end, Tufts publishes a series of policies that set expectations for student rights and responsibilities. Some policies are university wide, including the policies on discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and stalking. There is also a university -wide student grievance policy that outlines how stud ents can resolve grievances they experience and appeal university decisions. 47 In addition to university -wide policies, each school has a Code of Conduct or student handbook . AS&E's Student Code of Conduct applies to both undergraduates and graduate students and is distributed electronically annually , as well as being posted on the university website. It defines academic integrit y and proscribes academic misconduct, describes policies concerning alcohol and other drugs, prohibits hazing, and has other policies regarding student behavior that are appropriate to maintaining a positive and healthy learning environment at Tufts. It al so defines the fair and equitable procedures to be used when a violation of these policies is alleged. The AS&E student conduct process is educational and aims to help the students who are involved in it to learn skills like ethical decision making, navigating conflict with others, and respecting differing opinions. Consistent with the Student Life Review Committee report in 2017, Community Standards and the Committee on Student Conduct have built a culture of accountability in AS&E. Each of the other graduate schools have their own policies relevant to their student experience and their ow n procedures for resolving complaints; no similar initiative to build a culture of accountability has been attempted in those schools. Policies vary widely between schools and lack coordination. Procedures for resolving cases also vary in their philosophic al orientation and outcomes. See Work Room Documents Standard 5-5 for a list of the relevant policies by school. The university maintains a university -wide FERPA Policy that defines the privacy of student records maintained by the university. Each school supplements this with their own practices (e.g., AS&E FERPA policy ). There is also a university records policy that sets a records retention schedule , identifies records destruction practices, and otherwise provides for the management of university records. These policies are publicly available, respect the right of individual privacy, and consider the best interests of students and the institution. APPRAISAL Admissions and Financial Aid The number of applications received by each school has generally held steady or increased in recent years. Several programs are ex periencing enormous growth: undergraduate applications have grown over 60 percent in the last four years ( 2020-23) and TUSM M.D. applications have grown over 25 percent in the last four years. Between 2018 and 2021, AS&E developed several new graduate programs. Accordingly, AS&E saw a 51 percent increase in total fall applications submitted between 2018 and 2021. Almost all schools meet or exceed their annual enrollment targets, though the COVID - 19 pandemic has created enrollment fluctuations i n some schools, and new programs present new enrollment opportunities. See Data First Form, Standard 5.1, \" Admissions, Fall Term \" and Work Room Documents Standard 5-1 for trend information on application, acceptance, acceptance rate, and yield for each sch ool. In response to COVID -19's impact on access to the SAT and ACT, and in support of easing student anxiety about test access, undergraduate admissions implemented a three -year test-optional pilot for all first-year and transfer applicants. This policy, along with a successful residential experience during COVID -19 and innovative admission s outreach initiatives tailored to the virtual recruitment space, contributed to an enormous increase (35 percent) in applicants to the Class of 2025, which continued with the Class of 2026 as applications rose another al most 12 percent . Half of applicants submitted scores in the first and second year of the pilot, and the pool saw outsized growth , with historically underrepresented populations , including first -generation -to-attend -college students, underrepresented minori ty applicants, and international students. The pilot will be assessed in 2022 -23 to determine the future role of standardized testing in undergraduate admissions. At the graduate school level, five schools have made the GRE an optional part of the admissio ns process for many or all programs, while other graduate programs retain a standardized test requirement. Compositional diversity , and specifically the expansion of racial and ethnic diversity, has been a focus of admissions offices across schools as part of the Anti-Racist Institution initiative . Undergraduate 48 admissions have steadily increased the size and compositional diversity of its applicant pool and its enrolled first -year class, steadily growing the percentage of enrolled U .S. students who id entify as students of color from 33 percent in 2018 to 48 percent in 2022, with some meaningful growth in the proportion of the class that identifies as Black, Latinx, or multiracial. Work toward increasing compositional diversity has been less successful at the graduate level. University wide, the proportion of new graduate students identifying as U .S. students of color grew slightly from 29 percent in 2018 to 30 percent in 2021. Four graduate schools saw the proportion of new U .S. graduate students of col or in their incoming class decline, remain about the same, or increase less than 1 percent between 2018 and 2021; while only four saw gains of more than 1 percent . One notable success is TUSDM , where U .S. students of color are the majority of applicants an d the majority of new students, and where the proportion of applicants and new students who identify as U .S. students of color has increased annually for at least four years. There might be opportunities to translate TUSDM's initiatives into the graduate recruitment models of our other schools. A barrier to further diversification across school enrollment is finite financial resources in a competitive landscape. For undergraduate admissions, our need -aware admission practice limits our ability to admit and enroll as many students with financial need as deemed highly qualified by the admissions staff. Tufts is an inaugural member of the Schuler Access Initiative that seeks to expand our financial aid budget by $50 million over 10 years to increase the enrollment of Pell -eligible students or students with undocumented or Deferred Action for Childho od Arrivals (DACA) status, which will allow some progress on undergraduate socioeconomic diversity. For graduate students, financial aid is more limited, and Tufts does not guarantee admitted students it will meet their demonstrated financial need. For AS& E admitted Ph.D. students, tuition is typically covered for the duration of program admission by a teaching or research assistantship. For master's students, graduate scholarships are offered in varying amounts at the discretion of the department. For exam ple, at Cummings School , efforts to enroll a diverse student body from a relatively homogenous applicant pool are challenging given the competition from other lower -cost schools and the availability of financial aid. New diversity scholarships for the D.V.M. program may aid in increasing diversity. At Fletcher, rising costs of attendance have raised the barriers to enrollment for many, particularly international students , who make up 40 to 50 percent of Fletcher's student population. Retention and Graduation Tufts' strong retention and graduation rates demonstrate that our admission, financial aid, student services, and holistic student experience initiatives are working together to help students achieve their goals. The first -year to sophomore retention rate has been at or over 96 percent in nine of the last 10 years. The most recent six -year graduation rate for students pursuing bachelor's degrees is 94 percent , and the graduation rate has steadily increased over the last decade. Men graduate at a slightly lower rate than women. Some years have seen disparities between students by race in the retention and graduation dat a. The most recent master's graduation rate was 92.5 percent . In the most recent research doctorate (Ph.D.) cohort, 81.7 percent of students completed their doctorate or switch ed to a master's program and earned their master's. See Data First Forms, Standa rd 8.1, \"Undergraduate Retention and Graduation Rates;\" Standard 8.4, \"Graduate Programs, Distance Education, Off -Campus Locations;\" and p. 44 of Tufts University Fact Book 2020 -21, \"Historical Graduation and Retention Rates\" for detailed breakdowns. Overall Student Experience Surveys of graduating students consistently show that students are satisfied with their Tufts experience overall. Approximately 85 percent of undergraduate and graduate students in AS&E express that they were satisfied or very satisfied with their Tufts experience at the time of graduation. Across Tufts graduate and professional schools, graduating students overwhelmingly report that if they had to do it over again, they would definitely or probably enroll at Tufts for their graduate education, and a majority of undergraduates would encourage a student like them selves to attend Tufts. U .S. students of color generally report lower rates of satisfaction than their U .S. white and international student peers; this difference is particularly notable at the undergraduate level. Students generally rate their satisfaction 49 with their social life low er than their satisfaction with many other areas. See Work Room Documents Standard 5-6 for more information. Consistent with our goal of creating transformational experiences for students, a majority of undergraduate, graduate, and professional students a cross the schools report that they have had at least one transformational experience while at Tufts. When reflecting upon their Tufts experience at the time of graduation, nearly 90 percent of undergraduates express high levels of satisfaction with the opportunities for personal growth and development and participation in extracurricular activities at Tufts. Graduate students in AS&E overwhelmingly report a positive social and intellectual climate within their graduate programs and express satisfaction with the intellectual and social life and opportunities for interaction on campus more broadly. See Work Room Documents Standard 5-6 for more information on transformational experience. The COVID -19 pandemic significantly impacted the overall student life experience at Tufts. Most students were able to continue their education in person, but the mitigation measures necessary during the pandemic made the student experience during the 2020 -21 academic year unlike any other at Tufts, and there was a negative i mpact on students' satisfa ction. See Work Room Documents Standard 5-7 for a discussion of how COVID -19 impacted student life , and see Work Room Documents Standard 5-6 for information about how COVID -19 impacted AS&E student satisfaction scores and reports of transformational experiences. Community Building and Student Social Life Creating community is critically important to generating student success. At Tufts, many students' sense of community is primarily tied to affinity groups they are part of (e.g., athletic teams, student organizations, floor of a residence hall, etc.) , and students often report finding lifelong friends from these small groups. At the same time, students often express their sense that a macro -level Tufts community is missing. Undergraduates in particular yearn to be part of something larger than themselves and arrive at Tufts hoping to form a str ong sense of belonging at the university that transcends individual preferences and affinity groups. The relatively small number of campus traditions, lack of class -wide shared programs, and absence of signature experiences that are distinctive to Tufts make it difficult for students to feel connected to Tufts. The physical facilities on the Medford/Somerville campus also hinder more robust community building. The Campus Center is far too small, the libraries and dining halls often have no available seating , and there is no indoor location large enough for students to gather as a class for an event or a performance. This constellation of circumstances \u2014 combined with the scarcity of on -campus housing for upper -class and graduate students \u2014creates a dynamic wher e a sense of connection to a larger community is elusive, and it makes students heavily reliant on their affinity group affiliations. Students build individual relationships, gather in small groups, and invest time in their affinity gr oups, but many studen ts can't shake the feeling that they are missing the larger sense of connection or that they are not having a \"real college experience \" due to the lack of a larger Tufts community. See the 2017 Student Life Review Committee (SLRC) report . Graduate students also desire a sense of belonging at Tufts. While many graduate students feel a sense of affiliation with their lab, cohort , or program, the social and organizational opportunities for graduate students are more limited. Given the lack of opportunities to meet people outside their existing program, graduate students' experience relies heavily on a small group of people in thei r cohort, lab, or department. This sets students up for an acute challenge when they experience conflict or any number of ordinary challenges in their affinity group. There is a strong sense of shared values at Tufts \u2014including active citizenship, DEIJ, an d a desire to have a positive impact on the world \u2014which could form the basis of a \"One Tufts\" community. Moreover, when there are class -based events or all -student events , students respond enthusiastically, showing student appetite for such programming. Ou r challenge, then, is to support the development of an overall community with improved facilities and expanded programming that is specifically targeted at creating a larger sense of connection. 50 Mental Health and Physical Health Attending to student healt h is a key priority because students need to be healthy in order to learn and grow during their education. Mental health is particularly important given that Tufts students, in line with national trends, have expressed growing challenges with their mental health. In AS&E, undergraduate first-year, sophomore, and senior surveys from 2018 to 2021 indicate that emotional or mental health challenges very often or often impact students' experiences at Tufts, with a notable increase in 2021 .4 Longitudinal data from Tufts students participating in the Healthy Minds Study show that students meeting criteria for depression increased from 15 percent in 2007 t o 23 percent in 2018, students meeting criteria for anxiety increased from 9 percent to 18 percent , and students reporting academic impairment due to mental health concerns increased from 22 percent to 32 percent during the same time period . At the time of graduation, nearly 50 percent of undergraduates reported that they have used Counseling Services at some point during their undergraduate career ,5 and on a 2021 survey of current students, 25 percent of sophomores and 17 percent of first -year students reported seeking support from the Counseling and Mental Health Service in the past year .6 Across the period from 2019 to 2021, undergraduates increasingly reported that emotional and mental health challenges impacted both their acad emic and nonacademic experiences, and from 2020 to 2021 the percentage of AS&E graduate students indicating that mental health issues presented obstacles to their academic progress also increased. See Work Room Documents Standard 5-8 for more information. Tufts' work to address mental health has been involved and sustained. Led by Tufts' president, the Mental Health Task Force prioritizes the emotional health and well -being of students through targeted initiatives, collaborative programming, and direct student services tailored to specific communities. The task force's recommendations challenged us to improve the first -year experience to help students improve their social connections, increase supportive training for faculty a nd staff, improve services to students returning from leaves to assist with reintegration, and a variety of other items. The work on these priorities is ongoing, but the progress so far has been encouraging. Tufts has partnered with the JED Foundation to adopt a university -wide framework to promote mental wellness and address mental health issues. Additionally, staff at the counseling center has increased; all first -year students are housed together to increased social connections; and student affairs created and staffed a new department to work with students in a suppo rtive and educational capacity (rather than in a clinical setting) as they experience challenges during their time at Tufts or complete a medical leave. The Couns eling and Mental Health Service (CMHS) offers confidential individual and group counseling, medication management, psychoeducation, and a variety of other mental health services to AS&E and Fletcher students. CMHS also o ffers 24/7 crisis intervention and support. One -quarter of Tufts students use the services at CMHS annually, which has increased approximately 20 percent from 2016 to 2021. Acuity and severity of student concerns ha ve also increased, reflected in an 85 percent increase in after-hours crisis calls to the counselor on call, and a 55 percent increase in after -hours calls to our student -run hotline. An additional risk indicator is a doubling of the percentage of students reporting suicidal ideation in the two w eeks prior to their initial meeting with a counselor. To meet increased need, CMHS increased their staff by 18 percent and has added additional teletherapy services through Mantra, and increased identity -centered group discussions and counseling. Ninety -one percent of students who participated in the most recent Healthy Minds study and reported using CMHS were satisfied or very satisfied with the quality of their therapist. In 2019, the schools on the Boston Health Sciences campus launched an exte rnal counseling resource for students, the TalkOne2One Student Assistance Program. Cummings School had previously been 4 See Senior, First -Year, Sophomore Survey data , page 38 , Undergraduate Student Data . 5 On the Senior Surveys from 2017 -21, between 46 -48 percent of students reported using Counseling Services while an undergr aduate at Tufts. See data in this file in the \"Mental Health\" worksheet : Undergraduate Survey Data from 2017 -21 detailed . 6 See 2021 First -Year Survey and 2021 Sophomore Survey data in the \"Mental Health\" worksheet in this file: Undergraduate Survey Data from 2017 -21 detailed . 51 using this resource. TalkOne2One is available to students free of charge, 24/7, and provides confidential access to master's -level licens ed counselors. Access to therapy and other mental health services has been challenging for students who are physically remote from campus, especially when outside the U .S., due to challenges with insurance coverage abroad and providers ' licensure requirements. To address this challenge, Tufts launched a new teletherapy option in 2022 whereby AS&E and Fletcher students who are physically remote from campus, including when they are located internationally, can receive counseling for free in any language. AS&E and Fletcher students also have access to medical care on campus. The Health Service is a comprehensive primary care practice staffed by physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and nurses. Students may be seen for both acute and chronic health conditions and for preventive care. Services include on -site and telehealth evaluations and treatment, including laboratory services, pharmacy, referrals for specialty care, and care coordination. Health issues that are relev ant for residential students, including alcohol and drug use and sexual health, receive special attention. Additionally, we have partnered with local practitioners to offer acupuncture and chiropractic care on site. Most services are included in the health and wellness fee and are thus offered at no charge at the time of care. In 2021 -22, about 5,600 students used the Health Service, up from about 4,700 in 2018 - 19. Student Affairs Staffing and Organization Student affairs functions are decentralized at Tufts, with each school having their own student affairs and/or student life teams. There is no centralized student affairs unit reporting to university senior leadership, which impairs the coordination of policies and initiatives, reduces the services offered to graduate students, and makes the recruitment of student affairs staff more challenging. AS&E's Division of Student Affairs (DOSA) serves all undergraduate students and all graduate students within AS&E. The division includes about 115 full -time staff in a variety of departments: Dean's Office, Community Standards, Student Outreach and Support, Campus Life, Residential Life and Learning, the Health Service, the Counseling and Mental Health Service, Health Promotion, CARE Office, Car eer Services, SMFA Student Affairs, and Student Affairs Communications. DOSA is led by a dean of student affairs/chief student affairs officer who reports jointly to the dean of A&S and the dean of SOE . In AS&E, there are many student -facing and student support -focused offices that are not part of DOSA. This includes the Division of Student Diversity and Inclusion and the StAAR Center, which were reorganized in 2019. Current staff have done a remarkable job increasing and professionalizing DOSA and expandin g services to students over the last five years, including notably rising to the occasion during the COVID -19 pandemic. Nonetheless , DOSA remains significantly understaffed compared to peer institutions. A 2022 benchmarking review found most institutions o f similar size and character have student affairs divisions of 500 to 700 people; the lowest -staffed peer institution reviewed had about 400 full -time student affairs staff, compared to only around 115 at Tufts. In addition to limiting the services that ca n be offered to students and increasing the delay for individual attention, being consistently understaffed impairs recruitment of new staff and retention of existing staff and creates a situation where teams are prohibited from providing proactive educati onal services because the lack of bandwidth forecloses the opportunity to do work beyond responding to time -sensitive day -to-day tasks. The non -AS&E schools each have a different student affairs model. One commonality across these schools is that the stud ent affairs offices tend to be very small considering the size and needs of their student populations. For example, TUSM's Office of Student Affairs is combined completely with the Registrar's Office and is responsible for all enrollment management, studen t services (including all academic support) for students and advisors, and faculty coach support services. The Fletcher Office of Student Affairs has two full -time staff who oversee student affairs and student life. The TUSDM Office of Student Affairs consists of five staff. The individual way of organizing each sch ool has the advantage of each school being able to tailor its program to its student population, but it has the disadvantage of 52 reducing the overall services available to graduate students. It also forces a small number of staff to function in a number of areas and confront challenging situations , including complex student conduct issues and mental health situations without the specialists to do so. Increasing Student Population The university is halfway through a multiyear enrollment growth management pla n, which accelerated faster than anticipated in 2021 -22, largely the result of extraordinary forces related to the pandemic. From 2016 to 2021, undergraduate enrollment at Tufts increased by almost 21.8 percent, and graduate and professional enrollment has increased about 13.5 percent . While this is a positive trend that underscores the high demand for the Tufts experience, the increased number of students has also had implications for the student experience. In addition to putting residential facilities a nd social spaces over capacity, the increased number of students strains existing programmatic resources. For example, almost all pre -orientation programs have to turn away interested students due to capacity. Some student organizations cap their membership because they are un able to offer programs for the number of students who are interested. Club sports programs have also become increasingly competitive to access. The strain on residence halls, social spaces, and programs combine s to impair the close community feel Tufts wor ks hard to create, especially given the reliance on affinity groups as the primary source of community; increase s the challenges associated with daily life; and lead s to students noticing that there is less room for individual attention. Both facilities an d programs must scale up to serve the increased student population. Social Spaces and Student -Facing Facilities Tufts is a world -class institution, but the quantity and quality of student -facing facilities do not reflect this. In 2017, prior to the increa se in student enrollment, t he SLRC noted, \"Many students identified the lack of space in general as 'the big issue' on campu s ... what spaces are available seem always to be booked or do not have hours compatible with student schedules.... There is a need for shared space to socialize .... In addition, there is a significant need for additional flexible space that can be used in multiple ways as student needs and interests change from year to year\" and recommended that Tufts \"create more dedicated social spaces that are central to campus and can be used by different groups and organizations throughout the semester, thereby establ ishing inclusive social opportunities .\" In focus groups and survey responses to the SLRC, students observed that the lack of social space on campus gives greater social power to fraternities and sororities, because they have some social space and prime loc ations in the center of campus. Currently, there is inadequate space to support the social life that students want, the cocurricular experiences students plan, and the community building that is a core part of the student experience. Further, many student service facilities are nonfunctional or require significant renovation. At about 32,000 sq . ft., the Mayer Campus Center has long been far too small to house the programs and events students plan and too small to serve as a casual \"living room\" on campus where students can reliably stop by to meet up with friends, get a coffee, or work on a group project during peak times. There are only eight meeting rooms in the building, and the largest seats only 20 people; most rooms do not have audiovisual capability, and there is no storage for student organizations. The campus center was built in 19 86 and has not had a significant renovation since. In addition to being unable to meet students' needs, the building's age and size are at significant variance from peer institutions, creating a competitive disadvantage. A 2022 benchmarking review found th at almost all peer institutions with a similar student body size had built a new student center or completed a significant renovation of an existing student center since 2010 or are currently planning or conducting either new construction or renovation. Be nchmarking data also show that most institutions with a similar -size student population have a student center of at least 100,000 sq . ft.; several peers have multiple student centers, and several have a student center of over 250,000 sq . ft. Benchmarking a lso found several institutions that have a much smaller student population but larger student centers than Tufts. 53 Students generally rate their experiences with the Tisch Library and most athletic facilities positively (see Work Room Documents Standard 5-9) but common student places , including the libraries on the Medford campus, the Tisch Fitness Center , and the dining halls reach capacity regularly during peak daily usage, leaving students waiting around, unable to be with their friends, or not having a place to study or meet friends other than their residence .7 Although many students and student organizations are interested in performing arts, there is inadequate performance space to meet student demand. Many dance groups, for example, practice in lobbi es of various academic buildings after hours, because there is no proper space for them. In partial response to these challenges, Tufts activated a number of outdoor spaces by installing seating and lights, which has been met with positive student feedback during warmer months. In 2020 -21, classroom spaces were also opened to students to reserve for study, eating, and telehealth appointments when they are not being used for class. This past academic year, over 41,000 reservations for these spaces were made, showing strong student demand for more space. In addition to these measures, the opening of the Science and Engineeri ng Complex in 2017 and the Joyce Cummings Center in 2021 ha ve provided more study and meeting space for students, but the reality remains that we need more social and flexible space for students. In addition to the need for more social space, several existing student -facing spaces are in a state of disrepair. For example, Hooper Infirmary, home of the Health Service, and Sawyer House, home of the Counseling and Mental Health Service, both experience facilities issues that impact the delivery of health care to students regularly , including problems with heating, cooling, odors, and water damage/leaks. Match of Services with Student Needs Tufts regularly reviews data related to admissions, academic performance, retention, and graduation, as well as data from outcomes assessment, student experience, and campus climate surveys. Routine student surveys at the different schools assess students' postgraduate plans and experiences with academics, student services, and various aspects of student life. The schools review these data, often with assistance from the Office of Institution al Research (OIR) , to evaluate student services and academic programs for their effectiveness and equity, ensure their alignment with student needs and school - and university -level goals, and make necessary improvements. Many services appear to be successful in meeting students' needs. For example, at the time of graduation, undergraduates express high levels of satisfaction with services such as dining and health services, the University Chaplaincy, International Center , and Office of Campus Life programs .8 AS&E graduate students also report high levels of satisfaction with services such as the library, laboratory facilities, health services, and Career Center services .9 Individual student support programs are generally effective at meeting their goals. See Work Room Documents Standard 5-10 for data on BLAST/BEST outcomes. The student demand for increased identity -related services appears well served. Undergraduate senior survey data from 2011 -2110 indicate a high level of satisfaction among students who interact with the 7 Highlighting the importance of these facilities to student life, on a recent Student Dining Survey, undergraduate students especially indicated that dining services and facilities on campus play an important r ole in their academic and social lives at Tufts. See Work Room Documents Standard 5 -9 to view this survey data. 8 Between 84 -90 percent of students on the 2021 Senior Survey reported that they were \" satisfied \" or \" very satisfied\" with athletic and recreational facilities, bursar services, campus safety, dining services, health services, library services, the International Center, University Chaplaincies, and Office for Campus Life; students were only asked to rate satisf action with services they had used. Seniors reported lower levels of satisfaction with the Office of Fraternity and Sorority programs , with 56 percent of students who had an experience with this office reporting they were \" satisfied \" or \" very satisfied.\" See data in the \"Student Services Senior Survey\" worksheet in this file: Undergraduate Survey Data from 2017 -21 detailed . 9 The percentage of graduate students in AS&E who reported they were \" satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with the library, laboratory facilities, health services, and Career Center services ranged between 76 -95 percent on the 2021 GSAS -SOE Graduate Exit Survey. AS&E graduate students were least satisfied with adequacy and availability of on -campus parking and housing for graduate students, with between 55 -63 percent of graduating students reporting they were satisfied with these aspects of campus life. See data in the \"Student Services Grad Exit\" worksheet in this file: Undergraduate Survey Data from 2017 -21 detailed . 10 See Senior Survey data, page 2, Undergraduate Student Data . 54 identity centers, and the university has increased staffing and budget for these centers. Graduate programs and professional schools have likewise increased staffing and resources f or supporting an increasingly diverse student population. A chief diversity officer leads initiatives for the university, and assistant deans for diversity and inclusion provide leadership at each school. The University Chaplaincy includes a multifaith team of chaplains, advisors, and staff who support the religious, spiritual, and philosophical diversity of the entire university. A forthcoming Climate Survey, part of Tufts' anti-racism initiative , will provide critical information about how we can continue to move forward with student services that reflect students' needs. While the university is demonstrating that it is committed to, and capable of, adhering to the spirit a nd intent of DEIJ goals, there are some areas in which it could move closer toward these goals. There is opportunity for growth in the ways in which the university communicates DEIJ -related policies and processes to students. In fact, clarifying policies i s discussed as an area of growth in the Tufts as an Anti-Racist Institution initiative . A specific illustration of this point is the recent statements of some residential students on the topic of the policy for addressing bias incidents on campus. See Work Room Documents Standard 5-11 for student comments on addressing bias incidents. Specialized services at SMFA warrant further attention. After Tufts acquired SMFA in 2016, a concerted effort began to provide an experience that simultaneously gave SMFA students access to comprehensive Tufts resources, including social programs, student services, and a residential life experience, while also preserving the unique fee l of an art school experience. See Work Room Documents Standard 5-12 for more information about the student experience at SMFA. SMFA students report being satisfied with their academic experience and studio art curriculum but report being less satisfied wi th the out -of-the-classroom experience. It is particularly notable that the residential experience for first -year B .F.A. students, who live at the residence halls on Beacon Street, which are about a mile from the Fenway campus and farther from the Medford campus, is more autonomous than that of Medford -based first -year student s. Dining and transportation are challenging, particularly on the weekends when SMFA Caf\u00e9 is closed and the Beacon Street shuttle is not running. PROJECTION Admissions and Financial Aid The continued diversification of our country, and the globalization of humankind, present new and ongoing opportunities for schools to build connections in new communities and serve new populations. For the first time, the majority of U .S. high school graduates identify as people of color, and Latinx and multiracial high school graduates will represent an increasing proportion of that population for the foreseeable future. At the same time, we are nearing a so -called \"demographic cliff \" that begins in 2026 when there will be a sharp decline in the number of 18 -year-olds in the U .S. and in much of the world, which will create increased competition for traditional -aged undergraduates. The U .S. population is projected to shift south and west, w ith most U .S. Northeast states/regions seeing a declining population. The university is preparing for this shift to impact the undergraduate program first, with an impact on graduate programs to follow. Undergraduate Admissions is developing strategies now to anticipate these demographic changes. Anti-Racism Initiative Working toward the Tufts as an Anti -Racist Institution initiative will require continuous effort in the coming years. Within the initiative are several objectives , including reimagining campus safety, expanding implicit bias training, and establishing pipeline programs for students and faculty. A cornerstone of the initiative is the development of the Tufts University Anti -Racist Online Education Module. The module is to be taken by all members of the university community , including students. With a scheduled launch date of 2023, the education experience has two main components. There is the two -hour online component that features four sections to explain the four Is of oppression, followed by a timeline of Tufts' history, highlighting historical events that speak to the institution's anti -racist 55 journey. The second component that community members participate in is the three -hour community conversation to review the terms and concepts in the online module, and to discuss t he ways in which to actively apply the module lessons to our roles and positions at the university. Both the chief diversity officer's office in the provost's office and the associate deans of diversity and inclusion at the schools are involved in the crea tion of this module. Additionally, a new identity center for native and indigenous students opened in spring 2022 . Student Affairs Staffing and Organization The AS&E Division of Student Affairs began a strategic planning process in fall 2021. The strategic plan will be presented to the community in 2022 for implementation over the course of the next five years. The strategic plan will lay out a road map of new programs or services that are needed; existing programs that should be supported, strengthened, or modified; and programs that can be retired to focus on other areas. It is anticipated that additional programmatic initiatives related to the creation of a \"One Tufts\" community, the first -year experience, the sophomore year experience, student civic engagement, and graduate student experience will be focus areas. In addition, the next few years will require DOSA and other student -facing offices to recali brate the work life of student affairs staff. Given the remote work many people have done during the pandemic, many staff members' expectations have changed, and many people have adjusted their work so that it can be done remotely. This will require furthe r iteration and study to produce services that are effective for students and that produce a positive working culture for staff. Athletics Looking forward, Tufts Athletics seeks to continue expanding its fitness, club sport , and recreational offerings and provide comprehensive fitness/wellness programs that benefit the entire Tufts community. Varsity athletics aspires to operate an NCAA - and Title IX -compliant program that consistently achieves athletic and academic excellenc e on a national level with a diverse staff and student -athlete population that reflect the values of the university and contribute meaningfully to the experience of all students. Additional staff and budget resources are necessary to achieve these objectiv es. Additional Student Housing The planning phase for a new high -density residence hall is underway. This design of the new residence hall will be collaborative and involve students. The goal will be to create a community where students interact with one another and love living at Tufts. Even following the completion of the new residence hall community, Tufts will need to continue to plan for the addition of sufficient new beds on campus for the increased student population . Tufts should also add beds for juniors, seniors, and graduate students who currently want to live on campus but are unable to because of insufficient capacity. 56 Standard 6 : Teaching, Learning, and Scholarship The Standard 6 narrative has been informed by reviews of school -specific handbooks, bylaws, appointment/tenure/promotion manuals, other policy documents , and a series of school -based faculty consultations and a university -wide survey conducted by the working group with faculty and administrators. DESCRIPTION Faculty and Academic Staff Tufts University develops innovative solutions for the most complex global challenges through teaching, research, civic engagement , and the creation and application of knowledge. Faculty and academic staff play a critical role in achieving our mission for a better, brighter world and therefore are provided with the appropriate institutional support for advancing the university's mis sion through teaching, learning , and scholarship. Across its campuses, Tufts employs 1598 faculty (as of fall 2021) . Of the faculty, 9 17 are full -time and 477 are part -time. Education of undergraduate students is carried out primarily by members of the fac ulty of A&S and SOE , who account for roughly half of the university -wide faculty. TUSM and TUSD M employ full - and part -time faculty as well as a large number of affiliated clinical faculty. TUSM also includes additional full-time and part -time clinical faculty who are employed by affiliated hospitals and are not paid by the university and thus no t included in the table below . University faculty are predominantly white , but there is gender parity . Faculty Category Fall 2018 Fall 2019 Fall 2020 Fall 2021 Full-time 896 907 880 899 Part-time 445 448 450 495 Adjunct 21 31 28 38 Clinical 69 72 65 67 Researc h 83 80 83 79 Visitin g 22 14 16 16 Emeritus 9 11 6 4 Total 1545 1563 1528 1598 See Work Room Documents Standard 6-1 for faculty category definitions and faculty category breakouts by school . 57 58 Tufts faculty are expected to remain active in their respective fields and to gain regional, national, and international recognition through teaching, research, clinical work , and service . The faculty have the appropriate qualifications and experience to engage students in a wide r ange of innovative research endeavors offered by a student -centered R1 research university . Tufts emphasizes sustained expertise in one's field through active research ; acquisition of peer-reviewed extramural research grants; publication of peer -reviewed a rticles and studies; participation and leadership in professional activities; procurement of patents and inventions; receipt of scholarly awards; service as a source of expertise to the Tufts community; effective training and mentoring of students at t he undergraduate and graduate level, including postdoctoral fellows ; and teaching effectiveness , ranging from leveraging the learning sciences in course planning and evaluation to the use of innovative, evidence -based educational techniques. Scholarly ac tivities complement classroom teaching and impact the student experience. Faculty assignments are consistent with Tufts' mission and purposes and are clearly articulated in the university's public documentation . Each school, in its faculty bylaws and handbooks , defines the roles, rights, and responsibilities for all fac ulty titles and ranks. Faculty assignments and workloads are reappraised periodically and adjusted as institutional conditions change, in some cases by department chairs and in other cases by the deans of the respective schools. Typical course loads for te nure- stream faculty teaching in undergraduate programs are most often four courses per year for departments in A&S and three courses per year for research -active tenure -stream faculty in SOE . Teaching loads for faculty in all schools for graduate programs are outlined in faculty contracts. The university has a statement of expectations and processes to ensure that faculty act responsibly and ethically, observe the established conditions of their employment, and otherwise function in a manner consistent with the mission and purposes of the institution. Procedures are in place to support the university's ethical standards, including related to conflict of interest . The structures in place to report cases of concern include EthicsPoint . The governance system, benchmarked by the Office of Institutional Research (OIR) , ensures that the experiences and data gathered by each group at the university are coordinated, shared, and reviewed collectively for the purpose of improving the academic program and service of students.11 The university's policy on Academic Freedom applies both to teaching and research so that all faculty, tenured and nontenured, may freely publish the results of their research; are entitled to speak freely o n their subject in classes; and are free from institution al censorship or discipline when speaking as a citizen. The recruitment and hiring of faculty at Tufts are decentralized, and schools oversee their own processes for recruiting and hiring. Thus, faculty participation in the search process varies. One centralized aspect of the process is the use by all schools of Interfolio 's Faculty Search module, a software product for online applicant tracking and recruitment used for facul ty searches. All faculty positions are posted to Interfolio as well as to the university's careers website . All schools have in place processes for ensuring that hiring is as equitable as possible. Each prospective hire is provided with a written agreement that states explicitly the nature and terms of the initial appointment and includes, when applicable, institutional considerations that might preclude or li mit future appointments. Hire letters from all schools clearly state the nature, rank, title, terms of appointment, school responsibilities, faculty expectations, and benefits , including medical, dental and vision coverage, flex spending, life insurance, disability, and legal services. Tufts also supports work/life balance through benefits such as time off and academic and nonacademic leave options, employee health and well -being programming, and alternative work arrangements. Four schools, A&S, S OE, Fletcher, and Cummings School, offer retirement incentives or packages. 11 The University Fact Book also provide s documentation. Also see the OIR Webpage . 59 The criteria for promotion (and tenure where applicable) for all faculty titles and ranks are well documented in faculty handbooks. Several schools such as A&S, Fletcher, and TUSDM also have policies for contract review and revisions defined in their handbook. Tenure and tenure -track appointments are made in all schools except for Cummings School , SMFA, and in the non -basic sciences departments of TUSM. Cummings School and SMFA offer eligible faculty continuous term appointments and lay out the criteria for promotion in their faculty handbook s. Tenure probationary periods for all schools that offer tenure are outlined in the universi ty's policy on Academic Freedom, Tenure, and Retirement. The university ensures equal employment opportunity consistent with legal requirements and with its mission, as detailed on the Office of Equal Opportunity (OEO) website . In addition to university -wide policies designed to safeguard Tufts' commitment to eq ual opportunity and inclusion, all the schools at Tufts include the university Office of Equal Opportunity ( OEO ) policy in their respective faculty handbooks. The Center for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning (CELT) offers programming to all faculty throughout the university, in all stages of their careers. As a division of the Office of the Provost and a central resource for all schools on all four campuses, CELT is a resource for faculty, departments , and schools to collaborate on the advancement of a culture of learner -centered, critically reflective teaching and leadership rooted in research, evidence , and equity. At the school level, fa culty mentorship programs are available in the A&S, SOE , Fletcher, Friedman, Cummings School, and TUSM. The most robustly developed faculty development program exists in the TUSM's Faculty Development Program . Faculty in full -time professorial ranks for at least six years are eligible for periodic sabbatical leave . Sabbatical leave is granted as a recognition of notable service through teaching and scholarly contributions and as an aid and inspiration to further achievements and is intended to provide opportunities for scholarly d evelopment. In A&S, faculty may qualify for Academic or Professional Leaves , or may be eligible to receive funds for Professional Development as Full-time or Part-time faculty, as negotiated by the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). Tenure-track faculty in A&S are eligible for additional academic leave to prepare their tenure cases. Initial faculty compensation is determined at the school level based on academic discipline, degrees, faculty rank, academic market compensation data, resea rch productivity and related grant support, school budget, and equity. Full -time faculty are appointed as either nine - or 12-month employees and are eligible for annual salary increases. In A&S, deans and department chairs consult the College and Universit y Professional Association (CUPA) to benchmark salaries and aim to meet the 80th percentile of the CUPA salary data for new faculty hires. In SOE, the dean may rely on salary data compiled by the American Association for Engineering Education (ASEE) as a benchmark. Salaries for TUSM tenured faculty are benchmarked to data provided by the Associa tion of American Medi cal Colleges (AAMC). There are many opportunities for faculty evaluation and feedback, including at time of hire, during contract renewal times, during annual review s, and at documented intervals for the promotion and tenure of lad der faculty.12 Criteria for evaluation are based on the faculty's responsibilities and effort required toward teaching, advising and mentoring, scholarship, research, and service. For annual faculty reviews, all schools have a system in place for full -time faculty members to complete a yearly report of their scholarship, teaching , and service activities.13 Those faculty activity reports are reviewed by department chairs or academic deans, and in some cases by the school dean. For faculty who teach, summary data from student evaluations are used in faculty evaluation to improve instruction. In addition, the faculty handbook for A&S lays out the evaluation procedures for the S ervice Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 509 Union faculty as governed by the Full-Time Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) and Part-Time Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) . Each school, with the exception of Fletche r, has a faculty grievance committee and a written grievance policy. AS&E also ha s an ombudsperson. 12 For examp le, in AS &E, review procedures are in place for tenure -track and a variety of nontenure -track positions as stated in the Handbook . 13 Some use Faculty Success, and others use Elements . 60 As an R1 university, Tufts places scholarship and research at the center of its mission, as affirmed in the university -wide Research & Scholarship Strategic Plan , and provides many opportunities for students and faculty to engage in research activities. Each school at Tuft s defines s cholarship, research, and creative activity as integral to the mission of their programs and to faculty contributions to the school. Across Tufts ' schools, scholarship and instruction are mutually supportive, as exemplified by the acknowledgement that rese arch and scholarly activities are defined as active, systematic, and diligent processes of inquiry that lead to discovery, advancement, and dissemination of knowledge to the Tufts community and to the larger research community. Such scholarship is critical to sustaining high-quality teaching and mentoring. Academic programs generally provide clear guidance for students on expectations for research conducted in conjunction with their senior theses, master's theses , and capstone projects, or doctoral disserta tions. Job descriptions for undergraduate and graduate research assistants typically delineate required and desired research skills and qualifications. Tufts schools have clearly defined research roles and expectations for faculty members at different ranks, with a focus on independence and success in obtaining extramural funding. Expectations vary by school, discipline, and by faculty category (i.e., tenure stream, clinical, teaching , or research tracks). While some schools embed research support as a fac tor of base salary, others support research through supplemental means such as research supplemental funds tied to research productivity, research leaves , and faculty research awards.14 Faculty handbooks delineate the mission and purpose of scholarship and research and detail various means of funding and support for faculty efforts. Faculty members access research administrative support infrastructure through their academic departments, the Office of Corporate and Foundation Relations, and th e Office of the Vice Provost for Research, the latter of which holds signature authority for all grants submitted by the institution on behalf of the faculty. Support for research is also communicated through relevant links to existing university resources , including websites for central offices such as the Office of Research Administration (ORA) , the university's Institutional Review Board , and the Office of the Vice Provost for Research . Tufts is home to more than 45 interdisciplinary centers and institutes focused on a broad range of topics, from medicine, science , and technology to animals and the environment. Led by members of the Tufts fa culty, these centers and institutes contribute to education, foster cross -school research collaboration, and promote learning at the university. Since the 2013 self -study, Tufts University has elevated the priorities of DEIJ in teaching, learning, and scholarship. The main goals for DEI J articulated in the Report on the Council of Diversity of 2013 included a focus on faculty recruitment, retention, mentorship, work/life balance, and curriculum reform. In 2018, the restructuring of the Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) Office helped Tufts surpass the institution's 2013 goals. The university is now making DEIJ transformation infrastructural and durable. In 2020, the university committed to becoming an anti-racist institution and inaugurated the wor k of five Anti-Racist Workstreams . The extended and enhanced DEI J mission of the university is now articulated on the University -wide Workstream webpage and in a number of the handbooks of Tufts schools and units. The schools and units have developed DEI J strategic plans and in some cases published them, including AS&E, GSAS, Friedman, TUSM, and Cummings School . Another key feature of Tufts' investment in DEI J has been the establishment of the assistant or associate deans of diversity and inclusion at each of its schools. The Tufts University Cabinet on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion provides additional guidance on the universi ty's efforts in this area. The university has taken the initial step of establishing a baseline assessment of faculty climate and culture by participating in the Brandeis Unive rsity C-Change Climate Survey . In Faculty Handbooks Bylaws: Chapter 5, Cummings p.74 . 61 announced that it w ould be creating a new vice provost for DEI J position . Tufts complete d a national search in fall 2022 , with Monroe France starting in the position in April 2023 . DEIJ curricular change is being implemented in GSAS, A &S, SOE , and TUSM, where new courses are being developed to support and extend an anti -racist curriculum. CELT promotes effective inclusive and equitable practices in all its programming and through the Teaching@Tufts website. CELT also offers DEIJ-specific programs such as the Equity and Inclusion Fellows , the Mutual Mentoring Program for Faculty of Color , The Bridge Program: Historical Racism in Higher Education , and departmental or school -wide workshops upon request. Tufts is a member of the National Center for Faculty Development & Diversity (NCFDD), an external resource and support for faculty. A key element of the \"infrastructural turn\" in DEI J at Tufts has been the introduction of Implicit Bias Training (IBT) across the university, a central focus of the CDO 's recalibrated goals. The Implicit Bias Training initiative brings together a number of university offices under the coordination of the CDO office, including HR and CELT. Teaching and Learning At Tufts, faculty have primary responsibility for ensuring the university's educational excellence.15 The university strongly supports faculty professional development in this area and has university -wide services to support teaching improvement. Course evaluations are one such tool for ensuring academic and professional standard s for content and methods of instruction, as are the processes in place for faculty annual reviews , and in AS&E, for second - and fourth -year faculty reviews conducted as part of the tenure probationary period. Faculty evaluation requires documented evidenc e of teaching effectiveness, which is gathered in all schools of the university . As a teaching -intensive institution, Tufts endeavors to reward innovative teaching by offering teaching grants and awards, professional development funding, and m any internal training and development opportunities.16 The university strives to provide classroom experiences that promote learning , with physical surroundings appropriate to a variety of pedagogies and to encourage pedagogical and technological innovation. Tufts Technology Services (TTS) has made significant and ongoing classroom upgrades across Tufts to improve the teaching and learning experience for multimodal learning. As of fall 2021, more than 60 classrooms on the Medford campus have been upgraded for hybrid teaching and learning, which enables students to attend class sessions remotely at the same time as those attending in person. All of these spaces offer internet connections on which Zoom can run , and many offer Echo360 cameras as well. Some also offer special Zoom Room software and additional hardware for interacting with remote students. Instructors have flexibility in these rooms in how they include remote students and, at instructor discretion, make recordings of class sessions to share with students on Canvas , the university's learning management system . New courses in every school are subject to a curriculum review process through standing curriculum committees of facult y to ensure generally accepted standards. Detailed criteria used to ensure the content an d quality of new courses are provided in faculty handbooks and bylaws and discussed further in Standard 4. The review, tenure, and promotion processes described in each school's faculty handbook and bylaws describe how teaching is evaluated within the con text of individual programs. Student evaluations of teaching are widely seen as limited tools for evaluating the contents and methods of instruction within individual courses . Most schools at Tufts report ongoing debates about better ways of assessing teaching . As a result , AS&E established the Student Evaluations of Teaching (SET) Working Group in 2020, which is charged with reviewing the design, content , and delivery of student course evaluations 15 See faculty handbooks and bylaws for all Tufts schools. See Teaching Development, Awards and Funding summary . 16 See Teaching Development, Awa rds and Funding summary . 62 and the place of student feedback in the overall evaluation of teaching, with the goal of collecting additional useful information to improve instruction. In its first year, the SET Working Group developed and piloted a student -to-student video shown when evaluations forms become available, offering students context and advice for how to provide useful feedback in course evaluations. This video was piloted with 38 classes at the end of the fall 2021 semester to gauge its impact on improving the quality of student feedback on instruction. Departmental and program learning outcomes and assessment, in some cases driven by external accreditation standards, are another way faculty determine what and how students are learning, and how to improve instruction. Fletc her will soon also implement peer review as a supplement to teaching evaluations. Tufts' Center for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching (CELT) helps faculty cultivate teaching that is inclusive, centered on student learning, and guided by the latest research on learning, engagement, and instructional innovation, in ways that may also engage emerging technologies. In addition to providing one -on-one support for instruct ion, CELT collaborates with academic departments and divisions across campus es to sponsor workshops, seminars, and peer -to-peer collaborations on all aspects of teaching and learning. CELT sponsors regular symposia and an annual university -wide teaching co nference to highlight innovative practices and facilitate knowledge sharing among faculty, staff, and graduate students at Tufts.17 To support the development of interdisciplinary teaching and learning, Tufts' Center for Engineering Education and Outreach (CEEO), housed in SOE , is home to students, staff, postd octoral fellows, and faculty from SOE , and the departments of Education, Child Studies and Human Development, and Computer Science who collaborate on educational research and educational tool and technology development. The CEEO's goal is to bridge the divide between research and practice in order to transform resear ch into programs and resources that can be used across functional areas to enhance learning experiences both within and outside the institution. Along with CELT and CEEO, Tufts has also established The Insti tute for Research on Learning and Instruction (IRLI), which develops and sustains scholarly research on learning and instruction within departments, programs, and schools at Tufts. IRLI was established in 2018 and curren tly concentrates on supporting the scholarship of teaching and learning within the STEM disciplines, with the long -term goal of the institute being to include the arts and humanities, social sciences, and professional schools. To accomplish this goal, alon g with STEM -related centers and programs, IRLI has established close affiliations with CELT and the Tufts Department of Education. Tufts supports graduate student teaching effectiveness through programs such as GSAS' Graduate Institute for Teaching (GIFT), a two -phase program designed to prepare Tufts doctoral students for an academic career in teaching at the un iversity level, and Graduate Engineering Teaching Training (GETT) , the SOE's three -part program designed to do the same type of preparation for its students. TTS' Educational Technology Services Unit (ETS) supports Tufts faculty and academic staff in their use of available and emerging learning -centered technologies, including the university's learning management system (Canvas), synchronous collaboration platforms, and multimedia tools. ETS provides consultations, individual and group technology training, an interdisciplinary community of practice, and customized documentation and resources. As Tufts expands its online course and program offerings, ETS has expanded its support to faculty teaching onli ne. The Student Accessibility and Academic Resource Center (StAAR) promotes access to an inclusive and collaborative learning environment that fosters students' ed ucational growth and awareness, self - advocacy , and resiliency as it relates to their Tufts academic experience and beyond. The StAAR Center engages students, faculty , and staff to proactively support the learning needs of the Tufts community, and offers a variety of resource support to all students in A&S, SOE , SMFA, and Fletcher . 17 A CELT FY 2021 activities is available here . 63 The curricular and advising structure at Tufts University varies greatly among schools, as previously described in Standard 5. Each school has its own style of education , and each school's curriculum has its own aims and scope. Some schools focus more on providing instruction in disciplinary theor ies and the conduct of research, while other schools focus more on developing professional competency. Across the board, t he fac ulty work closely with their advisees to foster relationships that enhance academic performance, encourage participation in research or internships, and support endeavors in admission to graduate school or gaining employment. All of Tufts' schools conta in mechanisms for the review of their teaching practices and curricula, although these differ by school . In some cases, schools are accredited by their respective professional associations, and thus need to conform to certain external standards (e.g., the American Dental Association for the TUSDM). In other cases , internal mechanisms for review are supplemented by external reviews of departments and programs. Across the university, schools provide advising and teaching assistants, though the specifics va ry. There are generally four types of advising: 1) academic advising; 2) advising regarding study and work skills; 3) advising toward well -being; and 4) professional advising. Although to some extent all schools engage in these, their focus depends on the courses of study they offer . A more detailed discussion o f advising can be found in Standard 5. Most, but not all, schools employ teaching assistants (TAs), although their duties differ by school . In all cases though, the faculty are responsible for the selection and supervision of teaching assistants and regularly assess the quality of their teaching through the review of course evaluations. For additional information on the curricular and advisi ng structures across the schools, including the roles that faculty and TAs play, see Work Room Documents Standard 6-2: Curricular and Advising Structures across the Schools. APPRAISAL Faculty and Academic Staff Across schools, in many cases, there are in adequate workload parameters and policies in place, leading to inconsistent workloads among faculty. The increased commitment to DEIJ across campus es has resulted in faculty from underrepresented groups devoting increasing time to supporting students, participating in DEIJ programming, and serving as representatives on school -based and university -wide committees. Members of the working group for this standard conducted a university -wide survey of faculty that indicated disproportionate faculty workloads, es pecially for junior faculty of color, leaving a group of faculty feeling undervalued for their roles in teaching, research , and administrative work. In general, most Tufts schools, except for Friedman and Fletcher, lack \"best practice hiring manuals.\" Cummings School is in the process of creating a manual using Harvard's \"Best Hiring Practices\" as its guide. TUSDM relies on university and OEO's policy/guidance. More recently, there has bee n a sustained effort across the university to increase diversity as part of the faculty search process. This includes reviewing the composition of the candidate pool throughout each stage of the hiring process and mandating that faculty search committees p articipate in implicit bias training . Recruiting faculty and academic staff continues to be a challenge. The high and rising cost of living in the Boston area and the competitiveness of compensation package s are often cited as a dominant obstacle for recr uitment. Currently, metrics of DEIJ at the university indicate that Tufts continues to struggle in retaining faculty and staff of color \u2014an essential aspect of ensuring ongoing excellence in teaching, learning, and scholarship. Furthermore, diversity data show that the student body is overall more diverse than the faculty. Faculty survey results also indicate perceived inequities in compensation as well as in new hire and bridge funding packages. No specified policies or criteria are available at any sc hool related to the retention of faculty. 64 Procedurally, Tufts employs a robust set of tools and policies to guide faculty evaluations, such as self - evaluat ive process es, review by department chair or academic dean, and documentation of evaluation outcomes. However, in practice, the processes for conducting yearly faculty reviews at each school, along with criteria for merit increases, could be better documented in order to ensure parity and transparency across all schools. There is signi ficant heterogeneity across schools in terms of processes for annual assessments of faculty performance. This is understandable and even necessary given the different educational and research agendas of Tufts' schools. The consistency, rigor, and instrumen tality of faculty evaluations for merit increases or other achievement -based rewards do not readily appear to be methodical and/or equitable among Tufts' schools. At this time, there is no formal post-tenure review process for faculty at schools that offer tenure. The university -wide survey of faculty conducted for the purposes of this self -study suggests that current policies and procedures for the regular evaluation of appointments, performance, and retention are perceived by some respondents as relativ ely ineffective and inequitable. Additionally, service to the university with regards to work involving DEIJ is not articulated in university and school -based policies as explicitly counting toward promotion and tenure as much as may be necessary in order to recognize the increasing level of creative effort being asked of junior faculty of color in this area. For some faculty, particularly faculty of color, it may be difficult to meet the threshold of scholarly production required for promotion when a signi ficant amount of time is dedicated to formally and informally mentoring students of color and serving on committees and working groups that seek to include diverse perspectives at a time when the university is still struggling to recruit and retain faculty of color. Though there are some exceptions (AS &E, TUSM, and TUSDM), robust opportunities are not available to support faculty development over the course of faculty career cycles. Currently, where robust faculty development programs exist, these offer ings are generally fully optional and generally not incentivized. With the exception of TUSM and Friedman , Tufts schools do not have publicly available compensation policies. Salary grade systems for faculty are also not available. School deans assert that they have consistent processes (see Work Room Documents Standard 6-3: Faculty Compensation Practices) for determining salary offers to new faculty, as well as for calculating merit increases for current faculty, and that they actively make market and equity adjustments on a case -by-case basis. Survey responses suggest that some faculty perceive a lack of tr ansparency as well as an inequity in faculty salaries. Like many institutions , there is a challenge in remaining competitive with faculty pay, a problem that is most acute for clinical faculty. While some schools clearly state how salary equity is assessed , handbooks for faculty in many schools do not address salary equity. The annual merit increase process does not result in what some faculty consider to be meaningful increases. At least in some schools and departments, increases are not consistently tie d to merit. It is difficult to confirm whether or not Tufts is meeting the benchmarks for faculty compensation since compensation policies are vague and not documented in writing. Broadly speaking, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) r eports that the 2020 -21 average salary for professors across all Category 1 institutions is $159, 919.18 Tufts compares favorably, with male professors on 9-month contracts earning $161,361 and female professors earning $153,366. When compared to Category 1 private -independent institutions , Tufts compares less favorably (see Work Room Documents Standard 6-4: AAUP Salary Comparison for more detail). Since AAUP does not provide individual institution averages, we ar e not able to directly compare to our peer institutions (for example, other universities without business or law schools). Teaching and Learnin g To address rising enrollments and to signal internally and externally Tufts' commitment to keeping teaching a t the center of its mission, SOE and Cummings School have created a teaching professor 18 Category 1 refers to institutions characterized by a significant level and breadth of activity in doctoral -level education, as measured by the number of doctorate recipients and the diversity in doctoral programs. 65 track. The teaching professor track was developed in order to recruit and retain faculty devoted at the highest level to pedagogy. Teaching faculty are nontenure track a nd devote a significant portion of their effort to teaching and curricular development and innovation. In SOE, the teaching track complements and is parallel to the research professor track, whose primary duty is to conduct sponsored research. The standard workload for teaching professors in SOE is five courses per academic year plus one course equivalent of service. TUSM also has a nontenure educator track and in 2017 created a Department of Medical Education as an academic home for these faculty. Particu larly for the undergraduate population, the ways in which learning effectiveness is measured, especially by grading and evaluation regimens, require better clarity of vision at the institutional level, in order to find the balance between the pursuit of le arner -centered education and the salience of competitive performance assessments and ranking . Consistent assessment of student progress toward learning outcomes over time varies from program to program. See Standard 8 for more details. The university currently does not have a broad and shared framework for teaching effectiveness. The quality of i nformation about teaching is highly variable across the university, making it difficult to assess teaching effectiveness fairly and adequately to systematically support improved teaching. Faculty handbooks and documentation vary widely across schools, part icularly around institutional techniques and delivery systems that serve to further the mission and purposes of the institution, as well as the learning goals of academic programs. Impressive endeavors are underway however , particularly in the Institute fo r Research on Learning and Instruction (IRLI) housed within the A&S and SOE . IRLI's mission is to introduce and sustain active research on how Tufts students are learning, and use that scholarship to enhance, and even transform, educational environments. I RLI highlights the importance of research on learning and instruction , and such endeavors should be supported and expanded to serve other schools. While there are many opportunities for faculty development related to teaching through CELT and ETS, there a re limited rewards and incentives beyond the receipt of teaching awards to encourage teaching innovation and effectiveness. The Student Evaluations of Teaching Working Group is developing recommendations for improved methods of evaluating teaching effectiv eness specifically in AS&E . TUSM launched the Innovations in Education Intramural Grant Program in 2004. This program is designed to promote and support teaching innovations developed by faculty that will enhance the core educational programs and overall m ission of T USM . In theory, CELT is open to all faculty on all campuses to help navigate the challenges routinely faced in the profession. In practice, however, not all schools have comparable access to faculty development opportunities, and participation has limited impact toward faculty rewards or for tenure and promotion. For the undergraduate advising model, efforts are ongoing across schools to address new challenges in advising and to reexamine existing curricula to create a cohesive and uniform mode l for undergraduate advising. In recent years the model has changed frequently and has been inconsistently administered. The balance between staff and faculty contributions to the organization and coordination of the advising system has continuously shifte d. In addition, there is a concerning discrepancy in the distribution of advisees among faculty advisors, and faculty advising caseloads can vary widely within departments. Exacerbating issues include the continual expansion of the size of the student body , the expansion of programs (such as at SMFA), the diversification of the student body without an equivalent diversification of the faculty, and the stark rise in student needs around well -being and mental health. PROJECTION Under the leadership of Provost ad interim Genco, the provost's office has created the role of vice provost for faculty affairs and has recently staffed the office with two new assistant provost roles, one in 66 faculty affairs and one in faculty development. This expanded office will collaborate with all the schools to spearhead many of the projects described below. In collaboration with the Faculty Senate and school deans, the vice provost for faculty affairs is developing a university -wide set of workload expectations so that schools may codify policies for all ranks and institutional functions of their faculty, enhancing transparency and equity. Hand in hand with workload expectations is the need to ensur e equity in compensation. This will be a priority fo r the provost's office over the next several years. The development of ombuds positions constitutes another priority that the provost's office and the Faculty Senate have steadfastly been working to realize. As of fall 2022, Tufts will hire one ombudsper son as a staff position for the university, reporting to the provost. The university expects to hire a person with a J.D. or similar qualifications and in the coming two years will expand to hiring a second ombudsperson. The university plans to create a written policy or guiding principles related to the faculty selection process, composition and training for faculty search committees, and a set of metrics to track the yield of diverse hires resulting from the DEIJ measures being undertaken at the school level. The increase in staffing of the faculty affairs function in the provost's office will be a resource to support schools in their efforts to recruit and retain faculty. A coordinated effort will be made to build mentoring programs that support facult y from \"hire to retirement,\" which encourages mentorship throughout a faculty member's career and not solely in the first three years of hire. Additional recruitment and retention efforts will be supported through the availability of dual career counseling services in the provost's office. A dual career counseling function that serves the whole university will offer a variety of resources to help potential and current faculty with assistance getting past the barriers presented by relocating with a partner or spouse who is also seeking employment in an academic or professional setting. Finally, understanding the reasons for departures and terminations of faculty is critical for knowing how to further address this issue. The Office of Faculty Affairs plans to continue its participation in the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (COACHE) faculty exit and retention survey as one data point but acknowledges more work, especially at the school levels, is needed. Efforts will also be made by the provost's office in collaboration with the deans to develop a set of guiding institutional principles for tenure and promotion that take into account both the unique mission and distinct faculty bodies of each school and the need for a rigorous and equitable tenure process across the university. 67 Standard 7: Institutional Reso urces HUMAN RESOURCES Description Tufts Human Resources (HR) is part of central administration and supports the Tufts campuses . With 45 staff, Tufts HR includes the key areas of benefits, compensation, talent acquisition, HR strategies, and learning and development. H R provides service and support to approximately 5 ,000 faculty and staff across all four campuses and other instructional locations. Analysis Benefits Tufts strives to be an innovator and leader in providing comprehensive benefits designed to meet the diverse needs of faculty and staff. The university embraces its ongoing objective to provide an exceptional workplace in the development of programs to support the physical, emotional, financial, and social well -being of faculty and st aff. The benefit s plans offered include health, dental, vision, life and disability insurance, paid time off, tuition remission and reimbursement, a voluntary employee -paid retirement savings plan, and a generous employer -paid retirement savings plan that does not require employee matching contributions. In 2022, the university introduced a new comprehensive benefit s plan to support the diverse family planning needs for faculty and staff for conception and fertility challenges. In addition, a new vendor relationship began in 2022 for health plan coverage to address the needs of a national faculty and staff workforce. In partnership with benefits vendors, Tufts offers wellness programs and events, physical activity challenges, health screenings, weight manag ement series, and mindfulness sessions to support employees ' physical, emotional, and financial well -being. A comprehensive Employee Assistance Program provides individual and departmental support programs covering a wide range of personal and professional issues. A Flexible Work project was initiated in 2021. Tufts' flexible work framework offers an equitable approach to alternative work arrangements (e.g., remote and hybrid work arrangement s) and includes policies, guidelines, and tools for managers to use as needed and appropriate to support their teams and advance their unit's strategic goals. Compensation Tufts uses compensation management software to house a library of compensation market surveys and staff job survey benchmark information. Currently , Tufts has approximately 90 percent of nonunion , regular staff positions benchmarked in various salary surveys. An estimated 77 percent of staff positions are compensated within 10 percent or above the market median rate \u2014in line with the university's comp ensation philosophy. Faculty jobs are benchmarked in separate faculty higher education surveys, and the annual survey results are shared with school deans by Institutional Research (see Standard 6 for more details) . As part of the annual merit program, T ufts conducts a detailed analysis of market and economic and labor indices to recommend to university leadership annual increase percentages to keep salaries competitive. HR Strategies Each unit across Tufts is assigned an HR business partner who provide s support and guidance in areas such as workforce and strategic planning, organizational re/design and plan implementation, talent retention, deployment, career ladder development (working with Compensation), acquisition (working with Talent Acquisition), employee relations, conflict intervention, meeting facilitation , and resource referrals. The HR business partners work with other HR units to provide services such as job and compensation reviews, training and development, team development, benefits suppor t, and reporting. Additionally, they help with support and execution of other HR programs, such as flexible 68 work initiatives, merit review, awards programs, performance review , and health and wellness/open enrollment programs. Talent Acquisition and Hirin g Tufts is committed to attract ing, recruit ing, and retain ing diverse talent with the skills to perform the work across the university. As of fall 2021, Tufts employs 3,386 s taff across all campuses . Talent acquisition specialists partner with hiring managers to develop a recruitment and active sourcing strategy that casts a wide net to attract a pool of qualified and diverse applicants, managing the process from when a position is posted, through the interviews, reference, and back ground checks, to the offer of employment. The new flexible work framework offers broader recruiting opportunities where remote and hybrid work is feasible and continues to meet the needs of the stakeholders. HR offers and strongly recommends implicit bias training prior to initiating a search process. Tufts implemented a new Applicant Tracking System, a cloud -based product from the vendor iCIMS, in 2021. The new system, named Tufts Careers , will help to provide an improved talent experience for candidates and will allow the talent acquisition team to build a sustainable pipeline of future talent. In support of Tufts' DEIJ efforts, a new talent acquisition role was added that will be focused on increasing talent diversity throughout the recruitment and hi ring process, using short - and long -term methods of recruiting, such as school -to-career pipelining and adapting active sourcing to richer applicant pools, sites, consortiums, and events. HR is also partnering closely with the vice provost of DEIJ. Staff employees are provided with a detailed employment confirmation letter that outlines their employment status, and conditions and privileges of the at -will employment relationship. Additional terms of employment are contained in the Employee Handbook or Collective Bargaining Agreement as appropriate. Faculty are provided with a detailed contract letter that outlines their employment status (full time/part time), salary and benefit s status, start and end dates, general responsibilities, information about renew al, and tenure status if applicable. Additional terms of employment are contained in the respective school's Faculty Handbook or Collective Bargaining Agreement as appropriate. The Employee Handbook is available online. The university has a standing Employee Handbook Committee that makes edits to the handbook, not only to reflect changes in laws or regulations but also to stay current with best practices to attract and retain talent. The Employee Han dbook outlines a procedure for the redress of employee issues and concerns. Postdoctoral Scholars have a separate handbook . DEIJ Work In 2020 T ufts launched the Tufts as an Anti -Racist Institution initiative . As part of that initiative and i n partnership with the Office of the Chief Diversity Officer, Tufts H R helped to facilitate the creation of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). Currently Tufts h as the following ERGs available: Tufts Black Faculty and Staff Alliance, Color of Us, Hispanic/Latinx, Tufts Pride, Tufts Asian and Asian American Affinity Group, and Parents Employee Resource Collaborative. The COVID -19 pandemic challenged Tufts' way of w orking and engaging. The ERGs are diversity networks that serve the intersectional needs of faculty and staff , ensuring dialogue and connection can happen in safe spaces. In addition, these groups provide a platform for professional development and mentors hip. New employees will see there is already space for diverse voices and hopefully bring their authentic selves to work. Performance Development The Tufts Performance Development Program is designed to recognize and differentiate performance and includes goal setting, ongoing coaching and feedback, midyear conversations, and annual performance reviews. In FY 2021, an emphasis was put on the importance of recognizing and differentiating performance using the four performance ratings of: consistently exceed s expectations, 69 successfully meets expectations, meets some expectations, and does not meet expectations , as well as documenting staff goals and annual performance review in the online system. To date in 2021, 50 percent of staff employees have a perfo rmance review and rating documented in the online performance review system. Although this is an increase of 12 percent from FY 2020, the goal is for all staff positions to have performance reviews and goals in the online system. HR will continue to reinforce the importance of documenting performance reviews for staff in the online system in the coming year. Performance review completion reports are provide d to school and division leadership during the annual performance review period to show progress of reviews entered into the performance review system. Suggested annual merit increase ranges are provided for each of the four performance ratings, giving the additional opportunity to recognize and differentiate performance. Additionally, HR offers 19 unique training and development programs throughout the year to all employees. In FY 2021, HR implemented a Tufts Manager Development Certificate Program that consists of 85 hours of training, development, and networking activities for managers at Tufts. Projection Projected initiatives for HR include: Design and implement a new Executive Leadership Development Program to develop and enhance leadership skills for current and future university administration and academic leadership. Enhance current manager/leadership training to further build midlevel manager capabilities. Publish staff pay ranges to support pay transparency. Continue to enhance talent acquisition strategies for attracting and hiring diverse talent. Expand the capability of the applicant tracking system to support DEIJ. Continue to evolve the benefit s program strategy components of innovation , adaptation, affordability, and engagement. FINANCIAL RESOURCES Description Tufts ' strong financial strategy, management , and controls help to provide the resource base to support its educational, research , and community service missions. Integrated management and regul ar engagement of the Administration and Finance Committee (A&F) of the Board of Trustees, Executive Budget Committee (EBC), the president's senior team, and deans and school and administrative unit administrators provide the management and oversight founda tion stewarding and leveraging these resources to support the university's operations and resource priorities. Tufts has rigorous internal and external processes in place to evaluate its financial condition inclusive of working capital, capital projects, c ash flow requirements , and overall financial management. Administrative units meet regularly with various committees of the board to keep the board current on operating forecasts, comprehensive cash flow forecasts , the university's general fiscal condition , and opportunities for improvement and investment in both capital and academic areas. Fiscal policies are clearly written and consistently implemented in compliance with ethical and sound financial practic es (Finance Policies and Procedures ). The A&F Committee is responsible for recommendations to the board on matters pertaining to operating and capital budgets, tuitions, fees, and enrollments. The A&F Committee regularly reviews key financial metrics and enrollment data for the university, with comparisons to a broad population of institutions with the same credit rating and other peer institutions. Among the metrics considered are operating cash flow margin, endowment per student, total cash and investment to total debt, and tuition and fee increases. 70 The Buildings and Grounds (B&G) Committee, a subcommitte e of the A&F Committee, is responsible for considering the planning, expansion , and development of buildings and grounds as well as the maintenance of existing facilities. The B&G Committee advises the A&F Committee , which then approves the construction, r enovation , and maintenance of buildings and grounds. The Investment Subcommittee of the A&F Committee is responsible for the investment and management of all investment assets of the university, inclusive of the appointment of independent investment adviso rs and fund managers. The Investment Subcommittee develops the university's asset allocation policy and submits all investment results to the Board of Trustees for review and approval. This subcommittee also approves all financing transactions for the univ ersity. The A&F Committee and B&G and Investment Subcommittees meet a minimum of three times a year and as needed. Tufts engages in robust operating and capital budget processes, and annually produces a five-year operating and 10 -year capital budget and p erforms long -term strategic planning using the Synario software solution, which permits a long -range view of operating, cash, and balance sheet results. During November of each year, the board reviews initial budget assumptions, including proposed tuition and fee increases, financial aid, salary pool, and endowment payout. In February, the preliminary budget is shared with the Board of Trustees , and decisions on undergraduate tuition and fees are made. During May of each year, the Board of Trustees votes on the approval of the university operating and capital budgets , including new initiatives with impacts on the university's balance sheet, revenue, and expenses. Operating and capital budgets are prepared by the administration and vetted th rough the Executive Budget Committee (EBC) , which consists of the university's president, provost and senior vice president, executive vice president, and vice president for finance and treasurer.19 The EBC provides strategic direction and guidance for ann ual budget development and reviews monthly operating results, quarterly forecasts, and multiyear operating and capital budget models. The EBC has scheduled monthly meetings and adds meetings as needed. The provost's office oversees regular program reviews of all academic and research programs; these reviews are integrated into the annual budget development process. The Office of the Provost and the Office of Strategy & Program Development partner on the Program Development and Approval Committee (PDAC) to support the development of new programs and to help them through the approval process. This process ensures that the integrity of the institution and the quality of the academic program are maintained and enhanced. A financial review of new programs is part of the approval process. During FY 2021, Tufts' budget team engaged the school deans and executive administrat ive deans in a thorough review of the university's financial budgeting model. Organizational governance, and responsibilities and engagement between central administration and schools for establishing strategic priorities and long -range investments were re viewed, as were the business processes for resource planning and budget development, methods of resource allocations that accurately and fairly assign the costs of providing central services, facilities and operations , and funding and accountability mechan isms for investments in enterprise and school priorities. Financial and other risks are managed in several ways: The Trustees' Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (ARCC) assists the board in monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the university , compliance by the university with legal and regulatory requirements, and the independence and performance of the university's internal and 19 Reporting to the executive vice president, the vice president of finance and treasurer leads a team of five senior managers representing budget; finance and planning; procurement; treasury; and the controller oversees tax servic es; bursar; global operations, risk and insurance; research administration and compliance; Tufts support services (disbursements, travel, payroll) ; and the systems analysis group . In total, approximately 135 people provide financial services to the univers ity, ensuring financial strength and continuity of operations. 71 external auditors. The ARCC reviews the university's annual financial statement audit and annual Uniform Gu idance audit. The ARCC also develops and monitors policies and procedures for avoidance of trustee conflict of interest. Both Tufts and the university's external auditor, PwC, have conflict of interest practices that ensure the independence of the universi ty's auditors. PwC has been Tufts' auditor since audit year 2007. The collaboration between PwC and staff over the years has resulted in improvements in the audit work plan , leading to efficiencies for both PwC and Tufts. Importantly, the partners and staf f have always proven to be accessible and helpful in consulting on business and accounting matters. They have demonstrated a solid understanding of the higher education market and have been proactive in alerting the university to developing trends. The ARC C has three standing meetings annually , and if necessary, additional meetings are called. The University Risk Management Committee (URMC) , a university -wide committee from the E xecutive Vice President 's office, is responsible for providing oversight, guid ance, and coordination of university - wide efforts aimed at identifying, assessing, managing, and mitigating risks that may adversely affect the assets, operations, academic and research reputations, and legal interests of the university or jeopardize the life and safety of individuals. The URMC typically meets six times per year and more frequently if necessary. In addition to a new charter, a new scoring mechanism is in use for 115 identified risks . The URMC has prioritized mitigation initiatives for high -scoring risks based on high impact and likelihood. The Audit Management and Advisory Service team (AMAS) , another university -wide group, provides independent, objective audit assurance and consulting services that add value through its recommendations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Tufts' operations, manage its risks , and comply with regulations. By identifying opportunities to strengthen internal controls and compliance, AMAS assists the university in employing resources effectively and ef ficiently , maintaining the highest standards of business conduct , and handling any potential community member concerns, through its management of the EthicsPoint system. Tufts Office of Insurance and Risk Management (IRM) works to mitigate various financial, operational, security, and human capital risks that arise from the university's teaching, research, and support operations. The IRM oversees a comprehensive insurance portfolio , including the university's property and casualty insurance programs and associated claims, and the university's self-insured Workers' Compensation program. The IRM works with the community to understand and mitigate risks through corrections, prevention, training, and insurance . Tufts has compr ehensive insurance to protect the university's operations, a Continuity of Operations Plan that fulfills the Emergency Management Accreditation Program Standard 4.4, and the Tufts University Recovery Plan, which provides guidance for the implementation of recovery strategies following a major disaster. The University Gift Advisory Committee (GAC) provides advice and recommendations to the leadership of University Advancement regarding the acceptance of gifts from donors that pose a potential reputationa l risk, defined as the risk to Tufts University and its stakeholders arising from negative public opinion. The GAC has the overall responsibility for ensuring that the philanthropic support of the university aligns with Tufts ' values and mission.

Over the past 10 years, the university has grown the net asset base from $2.0 billion in FY 2011 to $3.5 billion in FY 2021; this is a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5 percent . Recent university financial statements are housed online . These strong resources support the university's mission and allow the institution to continue to strate gically invest in new opportunities. The university maintains a diverse revenue base, which allows it to withstand financial and other external stressors, including the current COVID -19 pandemic. Revenues and Expenses Revenues have increased by 44 percent from FY 2011 to FY 2021, or by a 3.7 percent CAGR. Leading the increase is net tuition revenue, with a 5.4 percent CAGR. Over the same period, expenses increased by 46 percent, a 3.9 percent CAGR. Tufts has maintained a diversified revenue base, though reliance upon net tuition revenue has increased during the period. FY 2021 revenue diversity reflected short -term stresses on clinical and other educational activities due to pandemic -related reduced clinic revenues. Revenue distribution from FY 2019 (net tuition (44 percent), research activity (21 percent), clinical and other (14 percent), contributions (4 percent), investment return utilized (11 percent), and auxiliary revenue (7 percent)) better reflects the distribution of the revenue base than do FY 2020 and FY 2021 due to the impact of the pandemic. Mission -related expenditures have grown at a slightly higher pace during the same period. Like the impact on revenues, clinical and other activities expenses declined in FY 73 2021 due to reduced clinic activities. Recent Debt Issuance During FY 2021, Tufts issued $250 million worth of 30 -year taxable bonds, strongly received in the market. This new debt is intended to fund a new do rmitory, develop and renovate additional housing and dining, allow for significant renewal of academic buildings on the Medford/Somerville campus, and create the infrastructure to achieve carbon reduction goals. As part of this strategic debt issuance , Tufts completed S&P Global's Ratings Evaluation Service and Moody's Investor Services Rating Assessment Service to determine the effect on the university's rating at different borrowing levels. The university chose to take a downgrade from Moody's to Aa3 to s trategically support the university's investment in critical infrastructure. Moody's notes that Tufts' strong financial management contributes to excellent strategic positioning and improved, though still somewhat thin , operating cash flow. Tufts' credit strengths include its reputation as a very selective, moderate -sized university in the Boston area, favorable enrollment trends, growth in net tuition revenue per student, relatively large and diverse operations, and sizable financial reserves of $2.3 billi on (as of FY 2020), which will be further bolstered by the Brighter World: The Campaign for Tufts capital campaign. S&P did not change the rating for the university, which is currently AA -/Stable, aligned with the new Aa3 rating from Moody's, with the iss uance of the new debt. S&P \"assess Tufts' enterprise profile as extremely strong, characterized by excellent demand, stable enrollment, a strong fundraising history, national and international reputation, and a solid management team.\" They note the univers ity has a strong financial profile, characterized by good financial policies and stable operating performance even during a period of difficult operations, although they note the university's maximum annual debt service (MADS) burden as an offset. Long -Range Strategic Planning Since FY 2004, financial management at Tufts has included a long -range strategic planning model to allow for initiative planning and scenario modeling. Beginning in FY 2015, the university moved the strategic planning model to a new platform that has allowed for school -level, as well as university -level, initiative and scenario modeling. Updated annually with actual financial results and new five -year operating and 10-year capital budgets, the strategic planning model tool is used ext ensively to model school - and university -level initiatives and assists in understanding the revenue and expense, capital, debt, and balance sheet impacts of opportunities with the net financial impact of each potential investment. The planning model has be en shared with school executive administrative deans and deans, the Executive Budget Committee, and the board so that informed decisions can be made. The model is also used with rating agencies and most recently, relied upon by both rating agencies in mode ling the impact of Tufts recently issued debt. Financial Aid Noted as the first initiative in the T10 strategic plan and a focus of the Beyond Boundaries Campaign, Tufts has enhanced undergraduate and graduate financial aid substantially over the past 10 years. Financial aid helps to further diversity in all forms and drives institutional excellence. Tufts is committed to making sure that all qualified applicants can afford an undergraduate education. Tufts proudly meets 100 percent of the demonstrated financial need of every admitted undergraduate student regardless of citizenship status, and growth of financial aid for graduate students continues to accelerate. The graduate and professional schools have policies for aid that differ by school but continue to direct additional resources to aid each year, sensitive to the amount of debt for graduating students. The board, a s part of the annual budget process, reviews and approves the financial aid allocation for undergraduate students, as previously noted. 74 Financial aid for all students grew from $102.2 million in FY 2011 to $154.4 million in FY 2021, a 4.2 percent CAGR in clusive of both undergraduate and graduate programs. Aid for undergraduate students grew at a 5.5 percent CAGR over the same period, from $59.5 million to $101.8 million, while graduate aid grew at a 2.1 percent CAGR, from $42.7 million to $52.6 million. Budget Performance From FY 2012 to FY 2021, net asset increases from unrestricted operations declined in the earlier periods , with planned investments in facilities, faculty, and financial aid. A focus on improving margins began in FY 2019 , with trustees establishing a 3 percent operating margin target by FY 2024. The COVID -19 crisis represented a significant unforeseen circumst ance in early 2020. From the outset of the pandemic , the university has proven its ability to respond, maintaining services to its students and researchers and closely managing expenses, resulting in operating surpluses in FY 2020 and FY 2021. Planned Investments Investments in faculty, financial aid, and Tufts Effectiveness in Administrative Management (TEAM)20 lowered operating results through FY 2015. Facility costs increased with the addition of new buildings in FY 2015 (Collaborative Learn ing and Innovation Complex), FY 2018 (Science and Engineering Complex), and FY 2022 (Joyce Cummings Center). The acquisition of SMFA in FY 2017 created unanticipated deficits, which the school has been growing out of. The university embarked on TEAM and other cost -saving and revenue -enhancing measures and set new margin target goals , which are now producing operating margins at the 3 percent target. During this period, in addition to streamlining cost centers and creating efficiencies, Tufts was adding to its revenue -producing programs and creating new opportunities. In FY 2017, as noted above, SMFA was acquired , and the Data Intensive Study Center (DISC), dedicated to data -intensive research and pedagogy across the breadth of the university , was create d to build on existing strengths and help the university realize strategies set forth in the T10 strategic plan. 20 The TEAM initiative, begun in FY 2013 and implemented over FY 2015 and FY 2016, created three new organizations: Tufts Technology Services, Tufts Support Services, and the Budget Center. Thes e streamlined administrative centers were created to achieve cost efficiencies and provide outstanding customer service. 75 Between FY 2018 and FY 2021, the university successfully launched 36 new graduate degree and certificate programs, accounting for 5 percent of graduate tuition in FY 2021. New programs include graduate offerings, online degrees, nontraditional learning opportunities, summer and winter offerings , and new undergraduate programs, including pre -college, which was supported by the creation of UC, intended to enhance the development of university -wide degree and nondegree programs to reach new student populations and develop new revenue opportunities. Tufts also began Phase 1 of the Research and Scholarship Strategic Plan to advance Tufts' research ent erprise over the next decade and launched Tufts' Launchpad Biolabs Incubator space for early -stage biotechnology innovators, as part of Tufts' T10 plan to support innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. FY 2021 was a milestone year for the university. It w as the first year that revenues without donor restrictions exceeded $1 billion. Tufts also was selected to join the Association of American Universities (AAU), a consortium of 66 leading research universities noted for their accomplishments in education, research, and innovation. This prestigious group helps to shape policy for higher education, science, and innovation and earns the majority of competitively awarded federal funding. T USM and Tufts Medical Center, as well as its parent organization, Tufts Me dicine, have begun work to create a new research institute that will advance both institutions ' ability to compete for research opportunities and further align educational missions. Investment Performance Investment performance during the 10 -year period w as variable, following general market trends, though Tufts did outperform the reference portfolio benchmark during that period with a 9.6 percent average growth rate (net of fees), versus the reference portfolio benchmark 10 - year growth rate of 8.4 percent . Tufts' Endowment realized a 6.4 percent CAGR for the 10 -year period ending in FY 2021. During that period, Tufts received gifts of $280 million and made other transfers into the Endowment of $197 million. Tufts' reliance on investment income as a percentage of total revenues has held relatively stable over the past 10 years, reaching a peak of 12.2 percent in FY 2015 and FY 2016 and averaging 11.5 percent. This includes net assets released from restrictions due to investment return utilized, which represents spending of restricted endowment payout from prior fiscal years. Starting in FY 2018, Tufts began to curtail spending from the Endowment by lowering the Endowment -spending band to 4 percent to 5 percent from a previous band of 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent. Through FY 2020, the university continued to lower the range of the Endowment spending band by 10 basis points annually (3.8 percent to 4.8 percent range in FY 2020), with the goal to reach a spending band range of 3.5 percent to 4.5 76 percent by FY 2023. With the uncertainty brought about by the C OVID -19 pandemic, Tufts allowed the spending band to increase to 5.2 percent for FY 2021, 5.1 percent in FY 2022, and 4.9 percent for FY 2023. University financial officers are working with the A&F Commit tee and Investment Subcommittee and may consider alternative endowment payout methodologies post -FY 2023. Fundraising and Engagement to Support Tufts ' Academic Mission The University Advancement Division (UA) is a comprehensive development and alumni eng agement enterprise with a staff complement of 202 FTE . UA serves the mission of the university by engaging Tufts alumni, organizations, faculty, parents, and friends in mutually beneficial philanthropy and volunteerism. Service to the university's schools is delivered in a distributed fashion, with staff alig ned with, and in some cases, situated in the schools they serve. Tufts has fostered a culture in which the provost and deans understand that their personal participation in external relations is key, and their involvement has contributed significantly to t he university's fundraising success. UA partners closely with these academic leaders and the university' s senior leadership team on goal setting (both annual and campaign) , and the positioning and marketing of fundraising priorities. In 2015, the advanceme nt communications function was integrated into University Communications and Marketing. The two divisions share a focus on external relations and collaborate closely on a variety of projects. In 2013, Tufts launched Brighter World: The Campaign for Tufts, a $1.5 billion comprehensive fundraising campaign that is strengthening Tufts' unique constellation of schools, expanding access to increasingly diverse students, enabling innovative research in fields where Tufts has distinctive strengths, and helping to sharpen the university's focus and ability to influence and improve the world through civic engagement. As of May 31, 2022 , Tufts has raised 90 percent of the Brighter World goal, with achievement (gifts + pledges) totaling $1, 346 million: $ 307 million has been directed to support of scholarships and financial aid; $5 95 million has been directed to teaching and research, including support for 6 4 professorships and other named positions; and $4 52 million has been raised for the university's en dowment. UA has consistently raised $100+ million annually over the last eight years. With an average of $160+ million over the last three years, Tufts is on pace to reach the overall goal by the planned end of the campaign on June 30, 2023. UA's fun draising strategies aim to secure a balanced mix of gifts for current use and long-term needs (endowment), while cultivating donors to fulfill their potential during their lifetime of involvement with Tufts. Of the $1.3 billion raised for the Brighter Worl d 77 campaign as of May 31, 2022 , more than one-third has been committed for endowment, with the remainder supporting more immediate priorities. More than 125,000 donors (individuals and organizations) have provided support for Brighter World . Compared to the previous campaign, Beyond Boundaries , Tufts has seen a decline in the number of donors ( 19 percent ) in the lowest gift band \u2014 cumulative donors of less than $ 10,000 \u2014but an increase in the percentage of dollars from this band (+9 percent ). This decl ine in participation is attributable to a specific circumstance for Tufts (a decrease in opportunities to support Tufts' Boston Marathon team) and to broader trends that much of higher education is experiencing with annual fund giving. The previous campaig n had two exceptional gifts of more than $100 million, which has not been replicated in the current campaign. Still, given the broad base of support across all bands of giving less than $100 million, Tufts is currently outperforming the previous campaign in achievement (+2 5 percent ) and dramatically outperforming if those outlier gifts (+70 percent ) are excluded . The university has more than doubled the donors and dollars in the $1 -4.9 million and $5-9.9 million gift band s. These results d emonstrate a very healthy distribution of giving and a more robust pipeline for 8+ -figure gifts in the future. Updated Principles and Policies for Gift Acceptance UA has increased its efforts to ensure that contributions do not introduce a conflict of in terest or reputational risk to the university. These changes were prompted both by the Report and Recommendations Concerning the Relationship of the Sackler Family and Purdue Pharma with Tufts University (The Stern Report) commissioned by President Monaco, as well as an emerging industry - wide recognition of the importance of donor due diligence research. Based upon recommendations from The Stern Report, guidelines and processes around gift acceptance were established and promulgated by the board, a due dil igence protocol was established, and a Gift Acceptance Committee was formed to review reputational risk associated with donors and their gifts. Projection Positioning Tufts to be as strong as possible in all areas with the start of a new president is our highest priority. Tufts seeks to preserve and grow its strength in liberal arts education, graduate and professional studies, and the experiences of its students \u2014and is working to determine which aspects should remain constant and what should be reimagined . Investment and growth in areas of research strength will be a focus, including integrating research and education across all the schools and advancing joint innovation with Tufts Medicine (agreement for the use of the Tufts name and a new research instit ute was signed spring 2022). In addition, allocation of resources in support of student emotional and mental health services, making progress on Tufts as an anti -racist institution and leading the fight against antisemitism on college campuses, and support ing a diverse and inclusive community will continue to be priorities. Determining how to refine policy and processes to turn our size into a competitive advantage and establish connections across schools/disciplines is a priority. To reach these key aspir ations and goals, the university is considering what emerging practices in education, research, and civic engagement should be implemented to enhance its differentiation, impact, and reputation. The institution is seeking out the most creative ideas for ad vancing collaboration and innovation at Tufts. The Office of the Provost and the Office of the Executive Vice President, through regular engagement in a strategic planning process that includes the input of the Dean's Council, has begun a strategic review to answer these questions. Tufts' strong financial management and partnerships with its leadership and board are a cornerstone for these plans. Maintaining an operating margin target of 3 percent established by the board will allow the university to grow financial reserves, create funding mechanisms for new investments, and maintain stable operations when faced with challenges. Tufts will need to stay vigilant and flexible to meet unanticipated obstacles such as the COVID -19 pandemic, and seasonal spikes m ay be disruptive. 78 When necessary, university financial officials have financial and operating levers to adjust to changing circumstances and will use these as needed to maintain the university's financial health for the stability of the its mission and its students, faculty, and staff. In the upcoming fiscal year, the financial management team plans to engage the Board of Trustees in a series of conversations regarding Tufts' current endowment payout policy and what may be the best model to provide stable revenue to support current budget needs, while still providing in tergenerational equity. Completing an ambitious schedule of capital projects that will help to transform Tufts' campuses is one of the highest priorities. Tufts is currently facing stress on the timing of these plans from inflationary impacts on capital e xpenditures along with supply chain constraints. Tufts is considering extending the timeline and scope of planned projects as needed, increasing fundraising expectations for new facilities in the plan while making sure its cash does not fall below $50 mill ion before considering further plan adjustments or borrowing additional funds. The university is on target to complete the Brighter World campaign and will soon begin to plan for its next fundraising campaign. Importantly, as is noted above, new revenue generation is critical for Tufts' continued success in achieving its mission. In addition to the creation of new educational programs and critical review of existing ones, Tufts is expanding partnership opportunities with external entities, such as Tufts Launchpad | BioLabs, Tufts Medicine, and others, as ways to grow its reputational and financial reach. INFORMATION RESOURCES Description The Tufts libraries embrace Tufts University's mission . To meet the challenge of being both student centered and research focused, the libraries are committed to these priorities: Lead the university by integrating opportunities for the development of critical information skills across the student experience. Provide resources and guidance for learning and student scholarship. Collaborate to deliver resources and services to support the faculty's research agenda. Tufts has a decentralized system of school -based libraries. Tisch Library, including the Lilly Music Library and the W. Van Alan Clark, Jr. Library at SMFA, serve AS&E; Ginn Library serves Fletcher; Hirsh Library serves the Boston Health Sciences campus; and the Webster Family Library serves Cummings School . Each library reports to a school administrator. Staff and facilities are primarily focused on local teaching, learning, and research support. The integrated library management system is shared , as are other tools that make resource discovery and access consistent across Tufts; these tools are managed by the Library Technology Services group in TTS. There is strong collaboration among the libraries oriented toward addressing both school -based an d institutional resource and service needs. The Digital Collections and Archives unit (DCA), housed in Tisch Library and reporting to the provost's office , oversees the University Archives, and contributes leadership and partnership in the development of d igital collections and infrastructure. Analysis A defining feature of Tufts libraries is extensive access to digital information, particularly journal literature in all disciplines. Library collections are well supported for current needs, with materials budgets totaling over $12 million in FY 2021. Costs for materials are shared based on consultation among libraries. Budgets have generally kept pace with inflation, although this can vary by school. Over 85 percent of current materials spending i s for digital resources. 79 In 2016 the addition of SMFA library brought unique materials focused on contemporary and studio art. Tisch Library funding of $250 -350,000 per year is enabling the curation of a world -class collection of artists books and spe cial collections in this area . All digital and circulating collections are available to the entire Tufts community. Tufts participates in several key resource -sharing alliances and maintain s membership in a network of industry organizations that expand access to content and expertise. Staffing has remained steady in recent years (90 -95 FTE across all libraries). Staff with disciplinary and functional expertise provide instruction, research consultation, collection development, and scholarly communicatio ns guidance. There is consistent outreach to student groups and centers on each campus. Feedback from surveys, focus groups , and student meetings is consistently positive. Librarians are involved in curricular planning at each school. Core functions such a s acquisitions, metadata management , and processing have been collaboratively designed for efficiency to be mostly executed by Tisch staff. Projection The Tufts Digital Library (TDL), a Fedora -based institutional repository, is a collaboration between the libraries and TTS. The TDL supports teaching and research and includes open access digital resources of enduring value created by or for members of the Tu fts community. DCA, Tisch , and TTS each contribute to the maintenance of the current infrastructure. The TDL, along with other systems resource mana gement infrastructure for the libraries. Together these systems enable access to and preservation of Tufts research output and scholarship, as well as management of all collections. Continued maintenance, feature development , and expansion of repository se rvices will require investment of expertise and funding. Library facilities must adapt to changes in scholarship and learning to be spaces that foster communities of scholars. In 2013, Campus Planning worked with an architect to design a refresh of Tisch Library that would have increased the amount and mix of spaces for individual and collaborative learning and research. The opportunity remains for Tufts to creatively integrate a variety of library, technology, academic , and research support services in th is busy central building. In 2015, Tufts engaged DJA Consulting in a review of the libraries to address acknowledged challenges and \"align the organizational structure and funding with a vision of libraries for a research university in the digital age.\" T ufts is unique among peers in its lack of an institution -level leader for its libraries, challenging the ability to support Tufts' increasingly interdisciplinary research and scholarship agenda. In late 2019 the AS&E Faculty Library Committee, in partnersh ip with the Tufts Libraries Council, followed with a proposal to create a university librarian position. The COVID -19 crisis and current transition in the provost's office keep this on a back burner. PHYSICAL RESOURCES Description The physical resources of Tufts University are managed by the Operations Division (Operations). Operations ' responsibilities span all campuses, including Boston Health Sciences, S MFA (acquired in 2016), Cummings School , and the Medford/Somerville Campus . The division includes Facilities Services (campus directors, building operations and grounds/labor trades, mail, engineering, work control), Campus Planning, Capital Programs, Real Estate, Public Safety, Dining and Executive Office Budget/Operations , and Administrative Services . Newly added to this slate is the Auxiliary Services group, overseeing conferences and events, vending , and parking. These departments are closely aligned to support each other in the performance of each mission. Operations has approximately 450 staff mem bers and oversees approximately 5.7 million gross square feet of owned and leased space. 80 The Facilities Management (FM) team at Tufts University supports operations on four distinct campuses. The FM department includes 120 union employees in the Facilitie s and Grounds Departments across the four campuses. Each campus is overseen by a dedicated facilities director , and within each department there are assigned managers who are nonunion Tufts employees. Custodial services are provided through a contracted third-party vendor, with oversight of the contract administered by FM. These three functional divisions (Facilities, Grounds , and Custodial Services) are responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of Tufts ' 5.7 million square feet of buildings \u2014 academic/admin istrative, hospitals/clinics, on -campus residential properties, grounds, and athletic playing surfaces, as well as 850 acres of land. The combined annual budget for all three of these areas is $70 million. Analysis Since 2012, various reorganizations and initiatives have better aligned the client service and stewardship responsibility of Operations within its internal organization. Some recent measures and measures in progress include: Conversion to zone management for facilities and greater intercampus coordination of standards and procedures Adoption of an asset -based management (ABM) and asset reliability strategy to track and plan for capital renewal, maintenance strategies, maintenance plans , and total costs of ownership of university spa ce and building system equipment Instantiation of a division and ultimately a university -wide initiative to implement and automate a foundational spatial database, through the development of a unified data model and supported by state -of-the-art geospatial information technology. This database and data model will be the authoritative source of current knowledge, informing university campus and capital planning activities, occupancy and space usage, building systems maintenance strategies , and capital renewa l decisions. The FM department is modernizing its current processes to incorporate ABM practices. Maximo, Tufts' system of record, has been enhanced to track work requests and to continuously track and record asset maintenance strategies, asset history, a sset condition , and asset criticality. This information in turn is used to inform preventive and other evolving maintenance strategies. A facilities planning function has also been implemented to work collaboratively with facilities managers to develop and implement weekly and ongoing maintenance activities that conform to maintenance strategies. Currently, the university utilizes various automated and physical review methods to assess asset and building systems condition and in turn to generate a capital m aintenance profile and replacement plan in conjunction with Finance, Campus Space Planning , and FM. The ABM program will update this process into a continuous review and assessment process that will enable increased accuracy and timeliness of renewal requi rements and costs. In these endeavors, facilities are constructed in compliance with all codes and standards and are maintained in accordance with legal requirements to ensure access, safety, security, and a healthy environment , with consideration for environmental and ecological concerns. Between March 2020 and July 1, 2021, capital programs were greatly reduced due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Major Construction and Strategic Capital Initiatives Significant new construction and major renovations that support the strategic direction of the university have taken place at each campus. From FY 2011 to FY 2021, Tufts has spent over $1 billion on construction and renovation projects across all four campuses for diverse projects , includ ing the new Science and Engineering Complex and other academic and research investments, a new Central Energy Plant (cogeneration facility), new and renovated housing for students, athletic improvements, and technology investments. 81 On the Medford/Somervil le campus , the following academic or research projects have been completed or are near completion: The new Joyce Cummings Center at the intersection of the athletic district, the sci -tech corridor , and the upper campus is a 150,000 square -foot cross -disciplinary academic and research building. The building contains classrooms, offices, dry research labs, computer teaching labs, multiple collaboration spaces , and a caf\u00e9. Construction started in May 2 019 and was complete in October 2021, with a small delay due to municipal ly imposed COVID -19 restrictions. The total project cost was $ 92 million . The Michael Laboratory wing (74,000 s q. ft.) of the Pearson complex received a full HVAC and envelope renewal in 2020. Two labs were reorganized for new faculty in parallel, with room left for growth in the chemistry department's research. Barnum and Dana Halls (54,000 s q. ft.) were renovated for multidepartment academic use and completed in summer of 2019. A squash addition (13,500 s q. ft.) to the athletics complex was delivered in February of 2020, featuring eight state -of-the-art courts. Tufts continues to look for innovative ways to bring additional beds online within the existing campus footprint. In the last five years , Tufts added approximately 550 new beds through \" bed optimization \" of existing residence halls, converting wood frame houses for undergraduate use , and leasing ~75 beds for SMFA students in Brookline. A major component of the new beds was conversion of 13 wood frame houses and construction of one new house for the use of juniors and seniors (apartment style), referred to as CoHo (Community Housing). The university continues to convert additional wood frame houses for residential use . Five such projects are currently underway , which will yield ~75 additional beds. Tufts is in the planning stages for a new residential hall for ~375 junior/senior apartme nt-style beds. In addition to bringing new beds online, Tuft s has also completed major renovations in Miller, Houston, Bush, and Tilton Residence Halls since last report. The Learning Spaces laid out an improvement plan for approximately 200 learning spa ces. Tufts has improved over 74 classrooms, seminar rooms , and tiered floor auditorium s over the past five years. Improvements included teaching technology upgrades, modern lecterns, finishes, lighting, supplemental wall writing surfaces , and furniture. Th e university continues to plan for improvements each year as part of the capital planning process. On the Boston campus, a new state -of-the-art Gross Anatomy Lab was completed in 2018. Tufts is in the process of co -locating the Clinical Skills and Simulat ion Center on an adjacent floor to the Anatomy Lab, creating a hands -on learning center for TUSM. TUSDM 's building at One Kneeland Street added a new entrance lobby and new elevator, dramatically improving the way patients, students, and staff flow through the building. Underway now is a $ 15 million upgrade to HVAC at the Biological Research and Public Health (BRPH) complex , which is home to a majority of the TUSM and TUDSM research programs. At Cummings School in Grafton, MA, recent notable projects inclu de lab space renovations at Peabody Pavilion (8,000 s q. ft.) in support of molecular biology and histology, capital renewal of an air handler and roof at the Small Animal Hospital, and the Multi purpose Teaching and Simulation Lab (5,000 s q. ft.) in the lower level of the Large Animal Hospital. Among the university's most significant accomplishments of the past decade has been the acquisition of SMFA . Operations is responsible for administering the long -term leases and operating the 140,000 sq. ft. f acilities that provide classrooms and instruction studios for the range of fine arts, offices, gallery, meeting space , and support functions. Capital projects spent approximately $8 million for life safety, code, HVAC improvements, and classroom upgrades , as well as for the addition of a caf\u00e9 space on SMFA campus . In FY 2022, Tufts purchased 160 St. Alphonsus Street from the M useum of Fine Arts, in lieu of continuing to rent this facility. 82 Projection The university investment in addressing facility deferred maintenance (capital renewal) continues to be a high priority , as described in the 2013 accreditation report. Tufts' building stock is older and consists of many smaller buildings, which increases the complexity of maintaining building conditions. Over the coming five years , Tufts will have several buildings and systems that will reach the end of their projected useful life. Between 2018 and 2022, $123 million in deferred maintenance funding was budgeted and is projected to be spent. Due to limited capital plan spending during FY 2020-21 (because of COVID -19), the university deferred approximately $50 million of work to later years. The current university five -year facility condition index (FCI) is .30, with the backlog and requirements totaling $690 million . The university plans to increase deferred maintenance spend ing and projects $340 million in deferred maintenance expenditures over the next five years (FY 2023-27). This includes projects that aid in carbon reduction and decarbonization efforts of Tufts' campuses and improvement of the university's underground infrastructure , as well as rethinking spaces post -pandemic . With the completion of the Joyce Cummings Center and the movement of different groups from either leased spaces or other academic buildings, Tufts has a planned list of next -generation academic and research projects , including the renovation of Eaton Hall ( A&S), Bacon Hall ( A&S), and Halligan Hall (SOE ), as well as the fit-out of the shell space in the Science & Engineering Complex ( SEC). Funding for these academic and research renovations comes from Tufts' recent taxable bond is suance. The debt issuance will also fund the planned new residential hall noted above, as well as renovations of dining facilities. Along with Tufts ' Flexibl e Work initiative implemented in FY 2022, opportunities for space consolidation or redeployment will be evaluated as workers designated as remote or hybrid experience reduced need for office accommodations on campus. This reduction and/or consolidation of space is expected to occur over several years. The university has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 or sooner and has a project - specific plan for the Medford/Somerville campus. A draft plan is being reviewed for the Grafton campus , and the Boston campus is subject to decarbonization requirements from the City of Boston. The plan for the Medford campus includes increasing energy efficiency in existing buildings, constructing any new buildings to be carbon neutral, converting the current heati ng system from steam to hot water, moving toward electrification, incorporating alternative renewable fuels as the industry matures , and purchasing offsite renewable energy. Work will continue on the implementation and automation of Tufts' spatial databas e, previously noted. TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES Description Tufts Technology Services (TTS) is a university -wide service organization committed to delivering technology solutions in support of Tufts' mission of teaching, learning, research, and clinical ser vice. With staff on all of Tufts' campuses, as well as a 24 /7 IT Service Desk, TTS collaborate s with schools and divisions to meet the demands of a global, mobile community. TTS strives for a collaborative, flexible work environment, embrace s diversity and inclusion, and encourage s personal and professional development. Currently, TTS serves the university through 10 directorates covering a full range of IT service areas, including enterprise infrastructure and operations, information security, library technology services, educational technology services, research technology services, enterprise application s and project portfolio management, business planning and administration, data strategy services, and design and digital services. 83 As of the opening of calendar year 2022, TTS operates with 265 full -time employees, an operating budget of $ 54 million (FY 2022), and capital project budgets of $ 13 million . Over 80 percent of the total TTS budget is spent on four service categories : administrative services ( including technology contract oversight and coordination for the university ); infrastructure ( including networking and shared infrastructure services) ; academic technology (including research, educational, and library technologies) ; and technical help and support for the Tufts community ( including a 24/7 service desk). Analysis TTS became a full -service enterprise IT organization in 2015 when most IT units and personnel across the university were consolidated as part of the Tufts Effectiveness in Administrative Management (TEAM) initiative. Since then, TTS has centrally managed a lmost all information technology and much of the technology purchasing and acquisition at Tufts. TTS plays an increasingly critical role in coordinating IT planning and purchasing across all schools and divisions, including contract reviews with a particul ar focus on data use and privacy, as well as managing duplicate or redundant costs. High-impact purchases are assessed for compliance with best practices in data security and privacy, accessibility, and alignment with key institutional standards for authen tication and authorization. This centralized coordinating role has allowed TTS to become an integrative partner with units across campus responsible for academic and administrative planning and assessment. TTS supports, adapt s, and maintains critical acade mic systems used for academic planning and program assessment in the schools, including clinical operations in Boston and Grafton. The TTS data warehouse, developed since 2016, provides a centralized integrated repository of academic and administrative dat a from most systems of record at Tufts. TTS provides expertise in data transformation, visualization, and analysis for Tufts central administration as well as individual schools. In addition, TTS' Office of Information Security (OIS) provides essential ce ntralized leadership across campus in setting policies and practices that mitigate risks around data privacy and security, and in responding to a growing array of critical threats. OIS works closely with the Office of University Counsel and school leadersh ip to set policy, detect threats, and respond to issues. TTS oversees business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR) approaches for enterprise systems and infrastructure. For core HR , finance, and student systems , DR plans are reviewed or tested annu ally for recoverability of these systems between the data centers located in Somerville and Boston. Core infrastructure elements are redundant across campuses , and data centers and certain critical functions, such as domain name services (DNS), are supplem ented with third -party protections to ensure availability and protection from denial -of-service attacks. Non-IT BC plans are in place for payroll and other key financial functions. For cloud services, such as Canvas, the contracting process for cloud vendo rs includes requirements for vendors to supply critical services. TTS has been well supported by Tufts through 2019 -2021 as the work associated with the centralization of IT has been completed. Funding plans are in place to ensure that core infrastructure , such as the campus network, classroom technology, and research computing have sufficient capital resources to grow and evolve with needs of faculty, staff, and students. Incremental investments are planned in the university budget to ensure that TTS is positioned to continue responding effectively to the growing demand for technology across all mission 84 activities; technology transitions driven by a move to software as a service ; and the increasingly challenging cybersecurity landscape. Between 2016 and 2 021, TTS made improvements to core network technologies , including upgrading wireless connectivity from 802.11n to 802.11ac, replacing firewalls for primary data centers, upgrading high-performance computing network switches to enable 100 Gigabit data spee ds for researchers, and transitioning Tufts ' dental and veterinary clinics to enterprise network connectivity to ensure secure and performant access to digital resources. Tufts' technology infrastructure enabled a seamless pivot to remote work and online teaching, learning, and research at the start of the COVID -19 pandemic. TTS was a key enabler in a research study that validated a pooled testing approach in use at Tufts, several other higher ed ucation institutions, and K - 12 schools across Massachu setts. TTS deployed remote virtual lab environments, held online training sessions and workshops, and published comprehensive guides to remote work, teaching , and research. By fall 2020, TTS had led the conversion of over 100 classrooms across Tufts' campu ses into multimodal classrooms allowing courses to be taught for both in -person and remote students. Projection The efficiency and effectiveness of TTS' pandemic response demonstrates the strong technology foundation that supports Tufts' mission. TTS is u sing the momentum of the pandemic response to further extend partnerships with academic and administrative units across the institution. TTS will continue working closely with these partners to transform administrative processes, with a focus on reducing s teps and complexity and optimizing the application of technology. A key piece of this digital transformation will involve replacing end -of-life administrative systems with modern HR, finance , and student information systems , and implementing more sophistic ated clinical systems to enhance patient care and clinical education, planned for the next five to seven years. TTS will continue strengthening the cybersecurity posture of the institution to combat increasingly sophisticated and malicious cyberattacks. T his includes continuing to build and recruit security talent and the implementation and enhancement of several programs such as centralized log management and security information and event management (SIEM), strong university -wide standards for managed and non -managed devices, evaluating next -generation authentication capabilities, improving identity management, and performing routine risk assessments and penetration testing. TTS will continue enhancing support for online learning and multimodal models of instruction by strengthening internal capacity for design and production while developing a consistent strategy for working with external online program managers (OPMs). TTS h as developed and received initial funding for a sustainable approach to funding and maintaining classroom technologies in the 350 classrooms and teaching labs across Tufts. In research, TTS is prepared to increase both capacity and agility to meet emergin g needs. This includes developing processes and materials to help researchers determine the technology and data needed for advanced research across all disciplines. A $400,000 National Science Foundation (NSF) grant proposal submitted by TTS in 2021 has be en funded to support significant additional capacity for processing, analyzing, and presenting significantly higher volumes of data , as well as for the application of artificial intelligence and other advanced analysis. TTS is developing sustainable approa ches to cloud computing in support of rapidly growing demands in research, including increased reliance on commercial cloud providers and regional academic consortia such as the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC). In addition, T TS is developing an agile model to create cloud -based , project -specific elastic computing enclaves that can be set up and supported efficiently to meet increasingly stringent federal security requirements. 85 Standard 8: Educational Effectiveness INTRODUCT ION Top Five Transformations and Ongoing Initiatives since 2013/2018 While many of these are described in more detail below, we want to highlight some of the strengths, weaknesses, and challenges that have emerged since our last accreditation visit and to underscore future areas for growth and development. Since our last visit and interim report, we have seen: 1. The infusion of DEIJ principles across the entire university curriculum and the substantive transformation of assessment methods and outcomes as a result, as well as the plans for future curriculum and assessment development 2. An overall shift in understanding of how student evaluations can be used to assess student learning and greater clarity about the ways in which evaluations can be useful in suggesting how students are learning, as well as greater clarity about the implicit bias issues they may reveal (see some of the innovative strategies below) 3. The formalization of assessment practices across the university, which, while they may still differ based on field, promote clearer accountability across our many programs 4. An acknowledgement that while we have formalized and systematized many of our assessment practices, programs across the university still operate largely in isolation from each o ther, and that as we move forward, we have opportunities to envision new ways to share information and best practices. (Note that some of these challenges may be addressed by the appointment in Fall 2022 of the vice provost for education , a new role in the university .) 5. A recognition that the profound impact of COVID -19 will shape learning outcomes and assessment practices for several years to come and that we will need to continue to map its effects on learning, student success (including student mental hea lth), recruitment, and retention. How Are Assessments Being Conducted ? As the overviews below suggest, assessment processes at Tufts vary widely and are often contingent on program structure and level. Each school/graduate program (A &S, TUSM) has some version of a Learning Outcomes Committee or other faculty committee that reviews and reports on assessment efforts on an annual basis, including assessment linked to formal accredita tion requirements ( see the Work Room documents f or the program -specific self -studies ). Additionally, while some programs conduct assessments on a regular schedule (mandated by external agencies), others work on a rolling cycle of assessment, review, and im plementation. The standard begins with an overview of undergraduate learning goals and assessments in A&S (the largest undergraduate population in the university ) and then offers overviews of the many graduate and professional programs across Tufts : In ea ch instance, the narrative provides both a broad view of each program and selected examples of how assessments have resulted in program change (or planned program change). Specific learning outcomes assessments ( LOAs ) for each department and program can b e found in the E -1 forms and Work Room Standard 8 Documents . The narrative draws on data compiled from a 2021 university -wide survey conducted by the NECHE Standard 8 Committee and the LOAC for A &S that help to suggest some larger trends in how programs are rethinking their assessment practices. How the Report Was Created A committee of faculty and staff from across the university met throughout the academic year (roughly every three weeks; meeting s were recorded so that those unable to attend could read minutes or view the ongoing conversation). The committee also collaborated with representatives from the OIR and the A&S LOAC to develop surveys and compile data. The committee sent out a university -wide survey in fall 2021. This survey targeted directors of undergraduate studies and graduate studies . The survey invited participants to respond to questions about their assessment, evaluation, and implementation 86 processes. It also asked how programs ev aluated or supported benchmark skills in their major and in the university's general education programs for undergraduates. In addition to the survey and the data supplied by OIR concerning student achievement and placement, the committee asked for E -1 forms as a means of mapping assessment practices across the institution. Additionally, committee members asked stakeholders in each of their schools for input on assessment processes and impact (particularly related to COVID -19 and DEIJ work). DESCRIPTION School Overviews School of Arts and Sciences (A&S) A&S developed and published shared learning undergraduate goals in 2018. Those focus on six main areas of demonstrated proficiency: Written communication Oral communication (including developing and making presentations) Research skills (including developing or designing original projects) Quantitative and qualitative analysis (including formal and historically situated knowledge) Understanding of scientific method Experience with creative expression See Work Room Documents Standard 8-1: Learning Outcomes Questionnaire Underg raduate Programs for information on how each program works with the six areas of demonstrated proficiency. Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) GSAS hosts 31 M.A., M.S., M.A.T., M.P.P., Ed.S., and Ph.D. programs and several certificate programs in a wide range of fields , from astrophysics and chemistry to theatre, dance, and performance studies to urban and environmental policy and planning . There are several pro grams accredited by an external accrediting agency , which include the Master of Arts in Teaching Education programs , the Occupational Therapy Entry -Level Doctorate, the School Psychology Master of Arts and Educational Specialist programs, and the Master of Arts and Master of Science in the Urban Environmental Policy and Planning programs. Program learning goals are inc luded on departmental websites (see E-1 Forms and Work Room Documents Standard 8-2: Learning Outcomes Questionnaire Graduate Programs ). School of Engineering (SOE) Ten undergraduate programs in SOE are housed in six departments. Eight of the 10 programs are assessed by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc (ABET). Assessment protocols are found on the ABET website. Examples of the most recent self -studies are found in the Work Room documents . As part of the ABET continuous improvement template, program educa tional objectives and student outcomes are monitor ed according to program -specific guidelines , with results used to measure program success and to inspire changes where needed. The ABET reaccreditation cycle requires formal self -study submission and site visits. The next ABET self -study submissions and visit are expected to occur in 2023. For M .S., doctoral, and Ph.D. programs in SOE , program assessment is interpreted by program faculty, the Curriculum Committee, the Outcomes and Objectives Assessment Committee, and the Graduate Studies and Research Commi ttee. Seven programs completed the November 2021 Standard 8 survey. The M.S. in Cybersecurity and Public Policy program was established in 2020 to \"train students to be translators between the technical and policy worlds in the field of cybersecurity policy\" and to teach students \"law, international relations, privacy, and technical material in cybersecurity.\" This program was developed in response to evolving study in the field. The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy (Fletcher) Each p rogram at Fletcher has its own learning outcomes published on the Fletcher website , which can also be seen in the E-1 forms. 87 Tufts University School of Dental Medicine (TUSDM) TUSDM offers a Doctor of Dental Medicine (D .M.D. ), Doctor of Science in Dentistry, Master of Science in Dental Research, 10 postgraduate residency programs, three fellowships, three certificate programs, and one internship. The D .M.D. and postgraduate residency programs are externally accredited by the American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation and undergo an external review process every five to seven years. (See self -studies in the Work Room Documents. ) Assessment for the D .Sc. and M .S. programs occurs via the Thesis Committee , Advanced and Graduate Education Committee, Executive Faculty Committee , and the Oral Qualifying Exam Committee. Student achievement is benchmarked through a combination of format ive and summative coursework, pre-clinical and clinical assessments, community service -learning experiences, and research projects. Student grades and clinical assessments, as well as external licensing and board exams , are the main sources of assessment d ata for the pre -doctoral D .M.D. program. Clinical assessments, portfolio reviews, research projects, and external board exams serve as the main sources of assessment data for the postgraduate programs. Portfolio reviews and research projects are evaluated by committees of department fac ulty and the Office of Advanced Graduate Education within Academic Affairs. (See Work Room Documents Standard 8-2: Learning Outcomes Questionnaire Graduate Programs and the relevant E-1 form s). In 2021, TUSDM began offering the Doctor of Science in Dentist ry. Students must complete a thesis and defense , at which they must demonstrate their ability to: Critically evaluate scientific literature Independently conduct a research study Interpret the results of a study Contextualize conclusions. Tufts University School of Medicine (TUSM) TUSM offers the M.D. program , including four combined degree programs (M.D./M.PH., M.D./M.B.A., M.D./M.A. in International Relations, and M .D./Ph.D. ), Public Health and Professional Degree Programs , two clinical graduate programs (Physician Assistant and Doctor of Physical Therapy), a Master of Science in Biomedical Sciences, a Master of Public Health, a Master of Science in Health Informatics & Analytics, and graduate programs in GSBS . The M.D. program is externally accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME; see the Work Room Documents for the self -study ). Multiple means of assessment are used to determine if graduates have achieved the program's stated o bjectives , including required coursework and course exams, core clerkships and NBME shelf exams, and USMLE Step 1 and St ep 2 (see E -1 form). Outcome measures are interpreted at multiple levels, ensuring appropriate actions if necessary, including additional evaluation of each required course and clerkship by the Curriculum Committee every three years. Major changes were mad e to the M.D. curriculum in 2019 in response to the 2014 accreditation report, specifically on the lack of formalized career planning and mentoring, and insufficient small group activities . The P .A. program and M .P.H. are externally accredited (see the Wo rk Room Documents for the self - studies ). The P .A. program uses coursework and course examinations, clinical rotations and end -of- rotation exams, a capstone project, and an end-of-curriculum examination to determine if graduates have achieved the stated outcomes (see E -1 form). Outcome measures are interpreted annually by the Curriculum Committee and self -study committees , who also monitor compliance with accreditation standards. The P .A. program has made minor changes to courses and rotations and added interprofessional education opportunities with other health care professionals . The two Doctor of Physical Therapy program s have been granted Candidate for Accreditation status by CAPTE and will have full accreditation review s in the near future . The M.S. in Biomedical Sciences program is a one - year program that supports students working toward terminal M.D. /D.O. or dental degrees. 88 Graduate School of Biomedical Science (GSBS) GSBS offers seven active Ph.D. programs, three master's programs, and two certificate programs. The Ph.D. program in Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics is no longer accepting students. As reported in the November 2021 NECHE Working Group 8 survey, th ere are four remaining students in this program who will complete their program by May 2023 at the latest. The Friedman School of Nutrition (Friedman) Friedman offers six M .S./Ph.D. programs and three stand -alone M .A. or M.S./Certificate programs. See E-1 forms for more information. Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine (Cummings School ) Cummings School's Doctor of Veterinary Medicine ( D.V.M. ) program is accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA ) Council on Education ( see the Work Room Documents for the self-study ). Cummings School also has three independent M .S. programs: M .S. in Animals and Public Policy ( MAPP ), M.S. in Conservation Medicine (M .C.M.), and M .S. in Infectious Disease and Global Health ( M.S.-IDGH), two M .S. programs combined with the D.V.M. : M.S. in Laboratory Animal Medicine (LAM ), the M .P.H. program (which is offered through the TUSM ), and one Ph.D. program , which offers five areas of focus: 1) infectious disease, 2) neuroscience and reproductive biology, 3) pathology, 4) clinical science, and 5) human -animal interactions. The Ph.D. and M .S. programs are collectively called the Graduate Programs . Assessment Tools Undergradu ate programs in A&S use both direct and indirect assessment tools. In keeping with Tufts' emphasis on student -centered learning, most undergraduate programs in A&S integrate students' evaluations of their own progress with faculty assessments in evaluating program success. Based on data gathered from the NECHE Standard 8 Committee survey (in collaboration with the A&S LOAC ), programs rely on a combination of direct and indirect data, much of it gathered once students reach the upper levels of their majors : In determining whether students have met the stated learning goals for individual majors, 66 percent of programs use student thesis projects , and 75 percent of programs use capstone projects or classes as foundations for assessment. Just over 75 percent of A&S undergraduate programs reported that their program routinely rethinks its curriculum based on ongoing discussion about levels of student achievement. M any departments and programs report synthesizing assessments of these culminating projects with students' own evaluation of their work as reported in senior surveys, department surveys, or other feedback mechanisms. Note that the A&S Student Evaluations of Teaching (SET) Working Group developed a set of recommendations and resources for including short formative assessments throughout the semester that are relatively easy to implement and that can generate better information about student learning, enabling the instructor to adjust techniques and/or content during the semester in order to better meet learning outcomes by the end of the course. Overall, 82 percent of undergraduate programs reported revising their curriculum over the past five years . Of the fe w who did not, most ind icated their intent to do so in the coming year (understandably, some programs have been delayed in planned revisions due to disruptions caused by COVID -19). See further descriptions in the Appraisal section below. Because so many p rograms in A&S continue to rely heavily on student evaluations as an indirect learning assessment, in 2020 -21 LOAC developed an A&S Course Evaluation Question Bank that can be used to gather better information through the student evaluations of teaching. T hese questions are mapped to the learning goals identified in LOAC's 2019 -20 report, which also track closely with the learning goals identified in the 2021 -22 questionnaire distributed to chairs and directors. Designed to garner student feedback that focu ses on teaching effectiveness , the specificity of the questions as well 89 as the scaled responses prompt students to think more carefully about the question as well as to reflect on their own learning rather than their \"satisfaction\" with a particular course or instructor. LOAC members piloted these questions in the course ev aluations for their own courses and noticed that they provided more useful feedback on learning and teaching than the standard set of questions. This set of revised questions is currently being used by the A&S SET Working Group to develop a larger questio n bank for faculty to use in their course evaluations, which should better reflect learning outcomes as well as help to mitigate biased responses. The A&S SET Working Group question bank will debut in spring 2023. And while a student evaluation of teachin g cannot and should not replace the more authentic assessments that faculty use within a specific course or major, it can supplement those assessments by having students provide feedback on their learning in, rather than their more general satisfaction wit h, a specific class. SET created a video pilot that premiered fall 2022 for students by students that helps them think constructively about providing feedback on the course evaluation forms to generate better information that can help instructors to unders tand what went wrong (or right) in a specific class to support growth and development as teachers. The five undergraduate programs at SMFA use Review Boards to assess students' progress on SMFA learning objectives. During Review Boards, faculty and studen ts consider a student's entire body of work for the semester. This process supports student ownership of assessment. It also helps students to integrate their research -based practice with their studio projects and articulate their own artistic direction an d questions, to evaluate their needs and achievements, and to plan their own development as an artist. More details on the Review Boards are available here . The graduate programs at SMFA also use Review Boards at the end of every semester to \"serve as checkpoints to assess progress and provide opportunities for further discourse about [students'] practice.\" These Review Boards serve as a critical assessment component of the M .F.A. degree: \"At the second Review Board, a determination is made as to whether the graduate student can move on to their thesis year. The approval process is managed, and ultimately determined, by the specific faculty members participating in each Review Board. The outcome of the approval process is recorded in the student's Review Board folder and submitted back to the Registrar's Office.\" In GSAS , most programs rely primarily on direct assessment to evaluate success and adj ust learning goals. Programs report using a number of benchmark qualifications, including qualifying exams, and capstone, thesis, and dissertation projects. Some programs also incorporate student and alumni feedback or use focus groups to evaluate student learning. The M.S. in Innovation Management ( MSIM ) in SoE reports that they complete a yearly review to identify areas for improvement in which they gather feedback, both structured and anecdotal, from current students and recent graduates. They reported in the November 2021 WG8 survey that the feedback from recent graduates has been \"extremely valuable\" in the assessment and improvement process. The M.S. in Engineering Management (MSEM ) program also indicated in the November 2021 WG8 survey that they use student surveys to assess the program; in addition, they complete external market research, and gather data from other schools offering MSEM programs ( e.g., Duke, Northwestern, Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Dartmouth). At Fletcher , students are assessed via the completion of capstone projects, internships, practicum projects, and midsemester meetings to evaluate progress in their programs. Within individual graduate programs, the faculty rely on a combination of direct and indirect measurements to evaluate pr ogram effectiveness. In addition to evaluating how students perform on the benchmark requirements for the graduate programs (including capstone and internship projects), Fletcher utilizes student feedback every term from course evaluations to make sure tha t the courses are meeting their learning objectives. 90 Based on the November 2021 survey by the NECHE Standard 8 Committee, the M .A., M.S., and Ph.D. programs in Friedman report relying largely on direct assessment to evaluate student learning and program s uccess. Student work is benchmarked in each program through the completion of various foundational requirements, internships, and practicum projects, as well as the successful completion and defense of graduate theses or dissertations. Direct assessments for students in the Ph.D. and M .S. programs at Cummings School include grades, homework, papers, class presentations, poster presentations, and class participation; the capstone work includes mentored externships, mentored research proposals/projects, and mentored case studies. Course evaluations and meetings with students inform the review process. Additionally, graduates are tracked , and information regarding their placements after graduation is included in the reports to the Advancement Education Committee ( AEC). Many graduates continue to terminal degree programs , while others secure employment. Assessment Review, Interpretation, and Response Process Oversight of assessment at the undergraduate level in A&S varies by department structur e and size : Overall, 47 percent of A&S departments conduct general assessments on an annual basis . Thirty percent report that their assessment timing varies and is contingent on what is being assessed . Eleven percent conduct some form of assessment every semester . Eleven percent conduct assessments biannually. Some departments, such as political science , have a standing Assessment Committee. Others, such as education, English, and theatre, dance, and performance studi es, report that their undergraduate committees review assessment materials . Psychology, history, and race, colonialism , and diaspora are among departments that review assessments through their respective curriculum committees . Additionally, GSAS has been w orking with all programs since 2020 to conduct a curricular review through a DEIJ lens. Nearly all departments with graduate programs have submitted progress reports speaking to this review, and many have taken actions such as reviewing admissions processe s, updating mentoring frameworks, and providing professional development for faculty to incorporate DEIJ into their teaching. At SMFA , data collected during the Review Boards are available for faculty to review to make improvements to their courses and programs and support an individual student's progression through the curriculum. All comments that faculty and students provide for any s tudent during Review Boards are assembled into a folder for that student, and faculty are encouraged to peruse this information so that they can better contextualize the trajectory of the student being reviewed. Of the seven graduate programs in SOE that completed the NECHE Standard 8 Committee survey, six revised their curriculum in the past five years, and all six made revisions based on faculty discussions of curriculum design and evolving study in the field or the implementation of new technologies. T wo of the M .S. programs also made revisions based on student feedback and assessment. At Fletcher, findings from student feedback on course evaluations and student performance on benchmark requirements such as capstones are reviewed by the Fletcher Academ ic Council. The Academic Council reviews all courses as well, ensuring that courses meet the academic rigor and requirements for the school. It also monitors time -to-degree as a measure of effectiveness (noting that there are both full - and part -time participants in many programs). The faculty also review students' own evaluation of their learning on an annual basis and through alumni surveys. Th e Master of Arts in Humanitarian Assistance (MAHA), a joint program between Fletcher and Friedman, reports that recent changes to the curriculum were based in part on graduates' input about the skills and knowledge they needed to be competitive after gradu ation. On the 2021 NECHE Standard 8 survey, eight programs in GSB S reported that they had revised their curriculum in the past five years: the five Basic Science Ph.D. programs (Cell, Molecular & 91 Developmental Biology, Genetics, Immunology, Molecular Micr obiology, Neuroscience), Ph.D. in Clinical and Translational Science, M .S. in Pharmacology and Drug Development, and M .S. in Clinical and Translational Science. Faculty discussions of curriculum design and student feedback contributed to revisions in all eight programs, and six of the eight programs also used program review feedback to make revisions. As a result of the curriculum review processes, the five basic science Ph.D. programs plan to add objectives in the following areas: Gaining a deeper understa nding and expertise in quantitative skills, coding , and data science Development of professional development skills such as science writing, communication , and presentation skills. The student subcommittee of the GSBS anti-racism working group evaluated two courses through an anti-racism lens and developed guidelines for faculty and course directors to utilize in evaluating all courses. It is expected that all courses in GSBS will be reviewed and modified as required. For the Biochemical and Mo lecular Nutrition Program at Friedma n, the Curriculum Committee and academic dean oversee and interpret the assessment data , and report that they will be implementing curriculum changes for the 2022 -23 academic year. For the other programs, a faculty commi ttee internal to the program interprets the data. Programs report that assessment occurs on an annual basis and that curriculum change is often the result of a combination of these evaluations, plus current student and alumni feedback. The MAHA program reported its last significant curriculum change in 2016 and did so in response to rapid changes in the field, as well as alumni survey feedback. (Information on student placement, which Friedman also uses as an assessment tool, is included below and in the work room documents .) Each graduate program at Cummings School has its own program committee that reviews its respective curriculum and assesses student progress. Assessment for the M.P.H. program is conducted through TUSM , but the D.V.M. track leader for the M .P.H. submits an annual report on the program to the AEC. Oversight for the assessments conducted by the program committees of the Ph.D. , MAPP , M.C.M., M.S.-IDGH, and M.S. in LAM programs is carried out by the school's AEC, which is the oversight standing committee for the graduate programs. The four M .S. programs complete self-assessments yearly as well as in -depth five -year reviews (M .P.H. completes only the yearly review). Additionally, the Ph.D. and three of the four M.S. programs in Cummings School revised their curricula in the past five years. The Ph.D. program adjusted didactic requirements based on faculty feedback to better support the different academic backgrounds of the students. The MAPP , M.S.-IDGH, and M.S. in LAM programs used student feedback and data from assessments to make revisions : For example, the M.S.-IDGH program collected written evaluations of the curriculum from students and then interviewed students about how the sy llabi reflected the course content and requirements. Additionally, they held faculty discussions regarding the curriculum and student experiences in the classroom. Two programs made revisions based on DEIJ work within the academic departments. The M.S.-IDGH program reported (in the November 2021 Learning Outcomes survey conducted by the NECHE Standard 8 Committee) that they were working to incorporate DEIJ conversations into their graduate programs. The MAPP program held group meetings with faculty, student s, and alumni to examine syllabi to ascertain weak areas across the curriculum , which resulted in a shift of some course content to another semester and the addition of content on the core concept of human -animal relations. The M.S. in LAM program integrat ed a journal club component throughout the curriculum rather than having separate meetings. The M .C.M. program makes annual curricular revisions but is planning a more comprehensive program review for the 2022 -23 academic year. DEIJ has been incorporated into the D.V.M. program at Cummings School in two new diversity and professional perspective courses, and the same is planned for all the graduate programs. Students in the D.V.M. program also have opportunities to develop cultural competencies during their three -week 92 core rotation at the Tufts at Tech Community Veterinary Clinic in Worcester, Massachusett s. This veterinary clinic provides care to pets owned by people with limited means within Central Massachusetts' underserved communities. Cummings School students and Worcester Technical High School students enrolled in a veterinary assistant program work together to provide these services, and Tufts at Tech is considered a pipeline program for Cummings School . D.V.M. students also participate in outreach activities within the local community, including providing veterinary care to pets of Worcester Housing Authority residents. APPRAISAL In the section below , areas are identified in which there has been growth in the assessment process, as well as areas that still require improvement. Because so many programs undergo external accreditation, the focus is primarily on those that follow an internal evaluation process. School of Arts & Sciences (A&S) A&S actively assesses its programs on a regular basis. Some examples are included here, and more examples can be found in Work Room Documents Standard 8-3: A&S Assessment Appraisal. Appraisal concerning student \"benchmarking\" at the undergraduate level: Based on the NECHE Standard 8 survey, programs report that students demonstrate success in the following shared school learning goals when they enter their majo rs and during their training: Written communication : 89 percent Oral communication : 81 percent Understanding of quantitative analysis : 61 percent Qualitative analysis based on formal and historically situated knowledge : 53 percent Data analysis : 50 percent Experience with creative expression : 39 percent Quantitative and symbolic : 33 percent . Importantly, 75 percent of departments reported that in the past they had expected students to acquire foundational skills in these shared learning areas throu gh their high school curriculum (including AP credits), while currently 58 percent of respondents reported that they expected these shared learning goals to be delivered through the general education curriculum. Some programs such as education, history , Latin American studies, and philosophy noted that they did not require that students have specific training in any of these general education areas prior to undertaking coursework in their disciplines. In progress/ areas for growth: As these responses suggest, there is not currently a unified expectation for or understanding of how students acquire foundational skills, nor are there clearly articulated benchmarks across the undergraduate A&S curriculum to evaluate progress or address deficiencies. The LOAC within A &S focuses largely on individual departments and programs; a future project might encompass a more holistic evaluation of the general education expectations across the school . It should be noted that LOAC has done an excellent job of tracking development within individual departments. For example, in 2019 -20, the A&S LOAC surveyed departments on how their recent assessments of student learning had shaped substantive and innovative curriculum transformation. Examples o f change post -assessment cycles include the following: Math : The department has revised the way that it assesses in Calculus by converting one high - stakes test into multiple, smaller assessments to build on student learning and help students to improve their performance and develop their understanding over time. In addition, this method of assessment allows instructors more opportunities to check on student learning and revise instructional methods in real time. 93 Anthropology : The department shift ed to applied problem -based learning that encourages knowledge transfer as students demonstrate the \"real world\" application of their learning. Anthropology also administers pre -assignment and post -assignment assessments in their larger classes as students work on ethnographic writing. These assessments can help instructors to understand how learning progresses through the course of the semester and prompt students to reflect on their own learning, which is a metacognitive strategy that enables deeper under standing. Political Science : The department uses a form of pre - and post -testing, giving the same assignment twice in the semester, once at the start and once toward the end, to see how student responses evolve. Faculty in Political Science also teach stud ents how to construct theories inductively, how to leverage \"negative cases,\" and how to select cases. Students first write a 5 -page paper comparing the causes of revolution in France and Russia. Then they write a 6-page paper adding China and adding two \" negative\" cases where revolution didn't happen, etc. Writing fellows work with the students on all three papers. Biology : The department requires students to write about their subject for the general public. This type of writing encourages students to und erstand the concepts more deeply in order to explain them to others. English: For each student the department collects an early piece of work and a later one, and has the student look over both of them together with their advisor. This process enables both the advisor and the student to assess progress in the student's education. Child Study: The department offers their undergraduates both formal and informal field experiences, where they can apply classroom learning to real -world settings and receive feedback from their field supervisors which is also shared with the faculty as a means of underscoring gaps in the current curriculum. Community Health : The department has students conduct literature reviews, and create posters, policy briefs, and other types of written and oral assignments that further develop the skills required for critical engagement with current challenges and solutions in our field. Students also design and carry out a small research project and publicly present the results. Students appl y their knowledge through professional internships, which in turn offer feedback to the program about potential gaps in the curriculum. In progress/ areas for growth: In response to concerns about levels of preparation and performance for incoming first -year students, the First -Year Writing Program (FYWP) is proposing to revise the A &S requirement so that all students would participate in the program (and not be exempted via AP placements, etc., which faculty have determined are not a sufficient indicator of student writing ability). This would help to create greater equity for the incoming classes, as well as a foundational vocabulary for critical writing across A&S. The director of the FYWP is already in conversation with stakeholders across A &S to develop a solution (though the implementation process will likely take 2 -4 years, given the complexity of the re vision). Appraisal of \"gateway\" course benchmarking: Similar to the rethinking of the FYWP , the A&S undergraduate survey revealed that several departments and programs , including biology, chemistry, economics , English, international relations, math, roman ce languages, and theatre, dance, and performance studies are shifting attention toward their lower -level classes as a way of benchmarking student learning. In progress/ areas for growth: The programs listed above have begun to reimagine gateway courses to support student learning and to promote more successful outcomes. Focusing on points of entry and benchmarking had not been as common a practice in past assessment cycles; the shift in ho w and when learning goals are assessed and the corresponding focus on entry -level courses is further noteworthy as part of Tufts ' DEIJ initiatives and its increased attention to asymmetrical high school experiences for incoming students. In spring of 2022, A&S launched a \"Start at the Source\" pedagogical program to invite proposals for revised gateway and foundational courses. Twelve 94 departments submitted projects that will be developed in summer 2022, implemented in AY 2022 -23, and assessed in AY 2023 -24. Graduate Schools Appraisal of GSAS : In GSAS , overall findings demonstrate students meeting the outlined learning objectives. However, we highlight below and in Work Room Documents Standard 8-4: Graduate Schools Assessment Appraisals some of the areas identified as in need of improvement and change . Because each program has such different goals and needs, they are described separately below. Challenge identified: The M.A. in History and Museum Studies reports that students' ability to meet the program's goals of \"working cooperatively on the investigation of an area of historical inquiry and be able to accommodate one's own research to findings of co -researchers and exhibition/program planning team members\" and \" exhibit an elementary ability to lead classroom discussion of historical material, assess historical work, and organize readings and agenda for analysis into an effective syllabus\" have been the most inconsistent. The program is currently developing a response to the se findings, and some changes, including a Graduate Roundtable, were implemented in 2021 (so its impact remains to be determined). In progress/ change implemented: The M.A. in Urban and Environmental Planning reports that based on its assessments, \"a subse t of our students struggle with quantitative reasoning and writing\" and that as a result, the program has redesigned its foundational coursework and plans to implement new courses and assignments to support development of these skills. In progress/ change implemented: In response to the need for students to develop critical writing and analytical skills, SMFA implemented the Graduate Critique colloquium, which offers a \"structured forum with faculty, fellow students, visiting artists , and curators,\" in which M .F.A. students cultivate the vocabulary specific to their field. PLANS AND PROJECTION As many of the department and school narratives above have suggested, COVID -19 accelerated implementation of online learning programs, but perhaps m ore importantly, it enhanced university awareness about the need to create accessible programming to accommodate a range of student abilities and address systemic inequities. The StAAR Center , which supports graduate students and undergraduates across A&S, SOE , SMFA, and Fletcher, has rapidly expanded its services to support student success, including online tutoring, resources to enhance online learning, and technology resources (such as literacy software). COVID -19, combined with the university's commitm ent to its DEIJ Strategic Plan , has meant that over the past two years Tufts has welcomed the most compositionally diverse undergraduate classes in its history, and the incoming undergraduate class of 2027 promises to continue that trend. First -year applic ations have increased by 50 percent in the last two years, and each pool has been more compositionally diverse than the year prior, with extraordinary growth among applications from students of color, first -generation students, and international students . Tufts continues to evaluate the need s of students, and to add programing that addresses all student identities. COVID -19 fundamentally changed not only the ways that many universities viewed SAT and AP requirements but also the very process of college touring. Virtual programming and tours h ave created an ease of access for students who might otherwise have imagined that they had to fly to campus to learn more about the university. Additionally, many Tufts graduate programs have also welcomed more compositionally diverse cohorts over the past two years because of their intensive DEIJ work, curriculum revision, and changing admission requirements (such as waiving the GREs). This increase in compositional diversity has paralleled programs' commitment to assessing and revising curriculum as well as benchmarks of student success. As noted above, GSAS initiated a DEIJ -based 95 overhaul of graduate education in 2019, and other graduate programs across the university have implemented similar changes designed to enhance DEIJ competence. The C ELT has impl emented a number of programs to support faculty as they incorporate more DEIJ practices and material into their courses and assessments. Those programs include year -long Anti -racist Pedagogy Learning Communities, as well as events such as the May 2022 camp us conference, Assessment, Evaluation & Grading: Are We Doing Justice? And small -scale pilot projects such as the new Start at the Source initiative to fund A &S faculty in redesigning foundational courses to support the school's DEIJ Strategic Plan will launch in summer 2022 to promote ongoing curricular transformation with the goal of supporting student success. By the time of the next NECHE interim revie w, programs across the university will have had the opportunity to evaluate the impact of DEIJ curriculum transformation and to assess how it has redefined student success. 96 STANDARD 9: INTEGRITY, TRANSPARENCY, and PUBLIC DISCLOSURE INTEGRITY Description Tufts recognizes the importance of fostering an atmosphere of integrity an d responsibility among all members of its community, ensuring that ethical standards are met, and implementing processes to address any violations of these standards. The university expects that all members of the community will act with honesty, integrity, and in the best interest of the university when performing their duties and studies, and will abide by the highest ethical standards of research, educational, professional, and fis cal conduct. While most policies are university wide, some policies governing integrity in scholarship, student behavior, and faculty research vary by school. Policies on fairness and nondiscrimination in staff employment are governed by HR, published i n a widely accessible handbook , and implemented and enforced university wide. Policies governing fairness and nondiscrimination in faculty employment exist in sc hool handbooks and are enforced at the school level. Complaints alleging discrimination among students, faculty, and staff are governed centrally by the Office of Equal Opportunity (OEO) . Tufts subscribes to an anonymous reporting hotline service provided by EthicsPoint . This service provides a university -wide mechanism for students, faculty, and staf f to anonymously report financial irregularities, noncompliance with policies and regulations, safety issues, and instances of discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct. The university allows and encourages all faculty and staff to engage in outsid e activities and relationships that enhance the mission of the university, but their activities are subject to the Conflict of Interest and Conflict of Commitment Policies . Tufts recognizes that a cademic freedom is essential to the search for truth and that academic freedom applies to the contexts of both teaching and resea rch. Freedom in research is fundamental to the advancement of truth. Academic freedom in teaching is fundamental not only to the advancement of truth but also for the protection of the rights of both the teacher and the student as a learner. Explicit policies on the Office of the Provost website outline and re inforce the university's commitment to academic freedom. The university recognizes the importance \u2014both legally and morally \u2014of protecting privacy. In addition to a university -wide privacy statement (adopted in 2018 ; revised in 2021 ), there are privacy statements for prospective students and applicants, students, job applicants, employees, alumni and donors, research participants, and online education and nondegree educational program participants. Links to these statements can be found in the footer of the university website . Tufts has a strong commitment to diversity and nondiscrimination and fosters an atmosphere of inclusion. As stated in its nondiscrimination statement (which was last revised in 2021) , Tufts does n ot discriminate in admissions, employment, or in any of its educational programs or activities on the basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin, ancestry, age, religion, disability, sex or gender (including pregnancy, sexual harassment and other sexu al misconduct , including acts of sexual violence such as rape, sexual assault, stalking, sexual exploitation, sexual exploitation and coercion, relationship/intimate partner violence , and domestic violence), gender identity and/or expression (including a t ransgender identity), sexual orientation, military or veteran status, genetic information, the intersection of these identities , or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal, state , or local law. Retaliation is also prohibited. 97 Tufts is licensed by the Department of Education in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and is currently in the process of registering with the Department of Education in Arizona for the Doctor of Physical Therapy program . As the university expands its programs, it is likely to register in other jurisdictions as appropriate. Tufts is also licensed to provide remote programs by participating in the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement, which establishes national standards for int erstate distance education. Appraisal Though the university already had robust policies and practices in place to foster academic and professional integrity, in recent years these have been strengthened to address gaps or new areas of focus. Conflict of interest and foreign influence. As part of ensuring transparency in business operations and protecting against any potential foreign influence on university enterprises, in October 2020, the university updated its policy on financial/personal conflict of interest and its policy on research conflict of interest and instituted a new policy on institutional conflict of interest and a new conflict of interest review protocol . In 2021 \u2014the pilot year for implementing these policies \u20143,698 staff and employees were asked to fill out a rev ised conflict of interest survey, with which 96.5 percent complied. This survey also addressed issues raised by recent foreign influence compliance requirements. In 2018, the university adopted a grievance policy to enable students (both on campus and online) to be able to file academic grievances. Compliance. To date, the university's compliance obligations have been enforced at the level of the local faculty and staff divisions. In May 2018, the university adopted new Standards of Professional Conduct and Integrity that reiterated the university's commitment to complying with applicable laws, regulatio ns, and policies. The standards provide a baseline for exercising good judgment and guidance for using university resources prudently, in accordance with our students' and community members expectations. A review of our existing compliance programs is unde rway and will further promote and protect the university's commitment to the highest standards of ethical conduct. In the last 10 years, the university has adopted or updated many policies that address the obligations of the university and its faculty, st aff, students, and vendors to comply with various domestic and international laws. These include: The False Claims Act policy Anti-trafficking policy Americans with Disabilities Act; religious and disability accommodation policies Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) policy Medical marijuana policy Policy on antitrust compliance Policy on poli tical activities Use of drones/unmanned aircraft systems policy Export controls guide Sexual misconduct policy Title IX policy Digital and web accessibility policies Nondiscrimination . As noted earlier, the university's nondiscrimination policy was revised in 2021. All supervisors are regularly trained about workplace policies regarding sexual misconduct , and discrimination and/or harassment based on any protected category and disability. In addition to enforci ng the student codes of conduct, which differ by school, Tufts offers a system of reporting and tracking bias incidents. Incidents can be reported to a resident assistant, peer leader, or the undergraduate Office of Student Affairs, and through EthicsPoint as described previously. The 98 university has two Bias Education Resource Teams (one for the Medford/Somerville/SMFA campuses and another for the Grafton and Boston Health Sciences campu ses) to address the impact of incidents of bias and related community concerns. In fall 2021, the university announced a new Indigenous Peoples Cent er, which , in spring 2022, joined the six other identity -based centers ( Africana Center , Asian American Center , FIRST Resource Center (for first -generation college students), Tufts Latinx Center , LGBT Center , and Women's Center ) within the Division of Student Dive rsity and Inclusion, which was formed in 2020. These centers provide regular workshops and programming for students on social justice issues. Anti-racism. In July 2020, President Anthony Monaco announced the Tufts as an Anti -Racist Institution strategic initiative, as described in the Institutional Overview. In February 2021, President Monaco committed at least $25 million in university resources over the ne xt five years to execute as many of the community recommendations as possible. In addition, schools within the university have embarked on efforts to develop anti -racism strategy plans specific to their communities. Antisemitism. In spring 2020, the unive rsity embarked on an effort to understand how the rising tide of antisemitism in the U.S. and on college campuses was manifesting itself at Tufts. The effort, which had an initial focus on the undergraduate student community, included more than 40 focus gr oups involving over 100 faculty, staff, alumni, trustees, and students from a diverse range of backgrounds and religious identities. In addition, it included a survey of the entire undergraduate student body and the 2021 graduating class. Based on the dat a collection, the university is currently identifying ways to implement recommendations, including: Further education and training for students, faculty, and staff, coordinated by the offices of the provost and the chief diversity officer, on what is consi dered antisemitism and antisemitic speech and partnering with nationally recognized organizations to do so Pre-orientation discrimination and bias -awareness programs that educate incoming students on antisemitism distinctly among other forms of race and et hnicity -based forms of discrimination Conversation, dialogue, and discussion forums on understanding better the geopolitical situation in the Middle East, which often influences how antisemitism manifests itself on our campus Better awareness of OEO processes and improved communication to the community about these processes The creation of a university -wide advisory council of faculty and staff to advise the university's senior leadership team on the best ways to appr oach the implementation process. As a first step in response to these recommendations, the university has joined Hillel International's Campus Climate Initiative (CCI), which will allow Tufts to work with partners at Hillel International to assess our cam pus climate as it relates to antisemitism and to learn best practices from 18 other peer institutions and their leaders. Student integrity. In general, schools have updated and detailed policies covering student integrity, code s of conduct, and procedures for grievance. In all cases, policies covering academic honesty have been updated over the past five years. Many of these policies or links to them are components of the relevant student handbooks and are thus easily accessible to student populations . (Note: Standard Five has additional information related to student integrity policies.) Responsibility for activities sponsored by Tufts or carrying the Tufts name. New academic programs, centers, institutes, and affiliations enable the university to maintain a position of intellectual and educational leadership. The university's goal is to maintain policies and processes that encourage the development of new ideas and support established programs, centers, institutes, and affiliations. 99 As mentioned above, in 2017 the university formed the Program Development and Approval Committee (PDAC), a partnership of the Office of the Provost andthe Office of Strategy and Program Development in the Office of the Executive Vice President. All new academic programs must be proposed to and evaluated by PDAC and have the written approval of the school or c ollege dean or deans following proposal guidelines and templates developed for each of a variety of program types. In May 2021, the university adopted new Guidelin es for Proposing New Centers and Institutes . These guidelines outline the steps necessary to develop a proposal, to obtain the required approvals, and to conduct the subsequent evaluation of centers and institutes. Projection Integrity policies and complaint procedures. Areas that the university is considering addressing in the future are: Ensuring availability and current versioning of all student handbooks/codes of conduct across all schools, as accessibility varies a cross schools Reviewing all school policies to ensure that they contain integrity policies and complaint procedures and revie wing all policies across schools, for consistency with one another Making relevant policies from the Office of the Vice Provost of Research (OVPR) and the university more accessible a s well as identif ying and clos ing any gaps that may exist. As with all policies covering integrity, school policies should clearly state that OVPR /university policies will be followed when school policies do not fully address components of the OVPR/university policies Updating the policy covering intellectual property rights (last updated in 2005). One consideration for this update: With the increas e of its remote -learning degree and certificate programs, the university needs to address the challenge of working on policies that address the intellectual property rights derived from remote learning programs Putting in a system to ensure that duplicate or out of date content across university sites is eliminated and users are directed to the OEO site so that the most accurate information is presented to students, faculty, and staff Finally, in consultation with the Faculty Senate, the provost's office has funded the hiring of a university ombudsperson . See the projection section of Standard 6 for more information on the hiring of ombudspeople. Part of the process will be developing information on how to access this assistance, along with procedures relevant to the availability of this support. Compliance. To promote and protect the university's commitment to its core values and the institution's high standards of ethical conduct, the university is un dertaking a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of meeting its compliance obligations. A firm (not yet determined) will be hired to do a gap analysis , which will provide the basis for determining next steps and recommendations for structure and staff ing in the areas of compliance. Responsibility for activities sponsored by Tufts or carrying the Tufts name. The Office of the Provost and the Office of Strategy and Program Development are considering the extent to which there should be a more substantiv e and formalized ongoing evaluation and review of educational programs, centers, and institutes at the university level \u2014including the creation of a set of metrics by which they agree to be evaluated on a regular basis. This analysis will draw on the practi ces implemented during the PDAC proposal development process. The collaboration also expects to comment on the extent to which there should be a process for the recommendation of program discontinuance , along with the policies and processes that would supp ort such a recommendation. TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE 100 Description University -wide communications at Tufts are centralized with the University Communications and Marketing (UCM) group, which is part of the University Relations division. UCM is responsible for creation and management of the university website ( tufts.edu ), as well as the university's news site (now.tufts.edu ), both of which serve to disseminate news and information to the university community and external constituents. UCM is also responsible for the university's media relations efforts , as well as university -wide brand and marketing init iatives. In addition to the university -wide communications function, each school has a communications team; sizes of these teams and scope of their responsibilities vary, but they each are broadly responsible for their school websites, social media, and internal communication. The tufts.edu home and upper -level pages include prominent links in the main navigation to the admissions sites for undergraduate students (A&S and SOE ), graduate and professional students, and nontraditional students interested in nondegree courses and programs . On tufts.edu, current and prospective students at all levels (undergraduate, graduate, nontraditional ) will find information about academ ics and student life. In addition to finding these webpages through the tufts.edu homepage, students can navigate directly to the schools' home, department, and admissions pages. Each professional and graduate school has admissions webpages on its site wit h information on the application process and deadlines, financial aid, student life, and where to send questions. The university sets forth the obligations and responsibilities of both students and the institution by providing detailed university policies by school and clear guidelines and expectations on student conduct. On the undergraduate admissions site, prospective students c an browse more than 150 majors and minors and narrow their search by school, category, and program type, and learn about every aspect of life at Tufts, from student organizations to athletics to music and the arts. A student life webpage helps current undergraduate, graduate, and nontraditional students easily find the information they need to make the most of their experience at Tufts. Each school website also provides up -to-date information on academics, admissions, cost of attendance, financial aid, student life, faculty, research, classes (including modalities of instruction), and campus settings to help students make informed decisions about their education. The Student Life website maintains job listings for on -campus work study, on -campus non -work study, and off -campus part -time positions on Handshake , Tufts Career Center's recruiting platform. Tufts Career Center serves undergraduates and AS&E graduate students looking for career opportunities \u2014 and alumni, faculty, staff, and employers looking to hire. The center offers workshops on resume and letter writing, i nterviewing, networking, applying to graduate school, and finding internships, jobs, and fellowships. It also provides ways to be part of professional interest communities. The Herd is a new resource, launched in 2021, connecting alumni and students from A &S, SOE , and SMFA for networking conversations, career mentoring, job shadowing, projects, and other career and professional development activities. Individual graduate and professional school sites also provide career resources, networking opportunities, internships , and in some cases, statistics on employment outcomes. (Note: There is additional information on careers in Standard Five.) The grading policies and procedures of A&S (including SMFA) and SOE are publicly available on the advising sections of the Student Life website , as well as transfer credit poli cies and procedures . Each graduate and professional school provides detailed information about grading , evaluation , and transfer credit practices on its website. Each school annually publishes information on codes of con duct, disciplinary action, and appeals procedures. The OEO provides information on its website about its processes , including its adjudication of sexual misconduct allegations and complaints of discrimination , and its management of the university's nondiscrimination , Title IX, and acc ommodation policies . 101 The Office of Institutional Research (OIR) publishes an annual Tufts University Fact Book. The 202 1- 22 edition is currently available as a downloadable PDF. Updates and corrections made since the 2021-22 Fact Book went to press will be found in this document. Tufts University audited financial statements are published after the close of each fiscal year (July 1 to June 30)and made publicly available on AccessTufts . The footer of every tufts.edu webpage includes contact information for that school or department, including phone, fax (if still used), and email. All tufts.edu upper -level pages include (from the main utility navigation) a link to the university's directory. Through careful reporting and editorial re view, the content shared via the university's print alumni magazine ( Tufts Magazine ), the Alumni & Friends website , and Tufts N ow is confirmed to be accurate, current, and complete to the very best of the university's knowledge at the time of publication/posting. An important part of ensuring completeness, currency, and accuracy lies in the fact that the subjects of content are sent that content to review before it is published or posted. In terms of accessibility, by default, the text of Tufts' online content is available for screen readers for those who are engaging with content and are otherly abled. The university makes certain that multimedia contain s the additional content required to make those assets accessible to those who are otherly abled. As one example, all the videos that the University Communications and Marketing team produces are a ccompanied by captioning. The university uses third -party tools to capture all earned media placements. The university then reviews, analyzes, and shares those placements, both internally (through reports and daily email updates to stakeholders) and exter nally (through posts on social media channels, reposts on the university websites, and links in university e-newsletters). When major media outlets misrepresent the university or include errors in their reporting, the university requests corrections and clarifications as appropriate , and refrains from reposting or retransmitting those stories unless or until they are corrected. Appraisal Although t he information published by Tufts on its websites and in print materials is readily accessib le and sufficient to allow students and prospective students to make informed decisions about their education , there are several areas that could be improved. Tufts does not currently publish a list of institutions with which it has articulation agreemen ts. Tufts does not currently state on its website that it is a private, nonprofit institution that does not have any religious affiliation. Some schools rely on individual departments, programs, and offices to inform their respective school's communic ations team when website changes need to be made, which sometimes results in outdated information on the website until it is seen by someone who brings it to the attention of the school communication team. School website maintenance is decentralized, makin g it difficult to be fully coordinated. A&S, for example, has more than 100 department and center websites with different content editors, and responsibility for managing them is dispersed across multiple school units. The search function available on the university's websites and designed to search across tufts.edu does not always yield the most relevant results, making it difficult for prospective students to find what they need through the main search. This has been improved with the new university website, but it must continue to be refined. 102 While it is easy to find specific contact information for schools, departments, and business units \u2014either on the school sites or in the directory \u2014it is not clear what the expected response time is ( for questions from prospective students, for example) , and there isn't a standard process for submitting questions, e.g., by phone, email, online form. A common challenge shared by the schools is the ability to maintain a very large roster of websites and publications with limited resources, i.e., staff and technology. For example, portions of the GSAS and SOE website s are out of date, in part because they currently use an outdated, labor -intensive content management system with strict requirements for con tent and images. The university's technology group (TTS) is currently in the midst of a project to move all sites to a modern platform , which will allow for significantly easier updating moving forward. It is sometimes difficult to know to which school a given webpage belongs \u2014or if it is a university webpage. One example is the Student Life webpage for A&S and SOE . The webpage is titled only \"Student Life,\" leaving visitors confused about whether its content applies to all schools or just A &S and SOE . Though there is extensive information available on the website, the committee did identify some significant deficiencies, including the lack of a SOE page for graduate -level courses, a Tisch College services page, and a UC personnel page. Further, the institutional research page on student outcomes is out of date, and information on retention and graduate rates is not readily available. Projection The university is already taking several steps to address some of the current challenges. In April 2022, Tufts launched a new tufts.edu homepage , with a primary focus on prospective undergraduate and graduate students. The site has a new layout and navigation, highlighting academics and student life, and geared toward helping prospective students find courses, pro grams, and degrees that meet their expressed interests, regardless of which school offers them. Based on their expressed interests, prospective students will be shown and receive relevant information designed to help them home in on programs of specific in terest. Individual school sites are being upgraded to the latest version of the Drupal content management system. UCM is collaborating with the schools and TTS to facilitate the sharing of data to make the application and admissions process smoother (e.g ., prospective -student leads can be shared between and among schools). A list of all articulation agreements is being developed and will be added to the Office of the Provost website in spring 2023. The most significant unaddressed area for improvement involves policies. The university would benefit from a central resource for maintaining, publishing, and updating all policies. These policies could then be automatically shared to the relevant school , department sites, and stakeholders within the university. There is an attempt at such a site, but it is incomplete and not highly visible to the internal community. A more comprehensive centralized approach would resolve the challenge of finding and maintaining policies. Too often the committee found multiple policies covering the same topics. On occasion, these policies were found to be outdated or inconsistent. "}
