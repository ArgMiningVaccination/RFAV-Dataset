Opioid prescribing recommendations: summary of 2016 CDC Guidelines1 Determining when to initiate or continue opioids for chronic pain Opioids are not first-line or r outine therapy Establish trea tment goals before starting opioid therap y and a plan if therapy is discontinued Only continue opioid if there is clinically meaningful improv ement in pain and function Discuss risks, benefits and responsibilities for managing therap y before starting and during treatment Opioid selection, dosage, duration, follow-up and discontinuation Use immediate-release (IR) opioids when star ting therapy Prescribe the lowest effective dose When using opioids f or acute pain, provide no more than needed f or the condition Follow up and review benefits and risks before starting and during therapy If benefits do not outweigh harms, consider tapering opioids t o lower doses or taper and discontinue Assessing risk and addressing harms of opioid use Offer risk mitigation str ategies, including naloxone for patients at risk for overdose Review PDMP *data at least every 3 months and annually*** Avoid prescribing opioid and benzodiazepines ently when possible Clinicians should offer or arrange MAT****for patients with OUD 2*Prescription drug monitoring program **Urine drug testing ***Some VA facilities may require more frequent testing ****Medication-assisted treatment Opioid use disorderPossible reasons to re-evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing opioid therapy: Opioids are associated with many risks and it may be determined that they are not indicated for pain management for a particular Veteran.1 No pain reduction, no impr ovement in function or patient requests to discontinue therapy Severe unmanageable adv erse effects (e.g., drowsiness, constipation, cognitive impairment) Dosage indicates high risk of adv erse events (e.g., doses of 90 MEDD* and higher) Non-adherence to the tr eatment plan or unsafe behaviors**(e.g., early refills, lost/stolen prescription, buying or borrowing opioids, failure to obtain or aberrant UDT ***) Concerns related to an incr eased risk of SUD**** (e.g., behaviors, age < 30, family history, personal history of SUD ) Overdose event involving opioids Medical comorbidities that can incr ease risk (e.g., lung disease, sleep apnea, liver disease, renal disease, fall risk, advanced age) Concomitant use of medica tions that increase risk (e.g., benzodiazepines) Mental health comorbidities that can worsen with opioid therapy (e.g., PTSD, depression, anxiety) Consider Tapering Opioid Prior to any changes in therapy, discuss the risks of continued use, along with possible benefits, with the Veteran. Establish a plan to consider dose reduction, consultation with specialists, or consider alternative pain management strategies. *Morphine equivalent daily dose **Consider assessment for opioid use disorder (OUD) *** Urine drug test ****Substance use disorder Personal history of SUD includes alcohol use disorder (AUD), opioid use disorder (OUD), and/or a use disorder involving other substances 3When considering an opioid taper, monitor for conditions that may warrant evaluation and arrange primary care and/or emergency department follow-up when indicated: 2 4Disorders that may need urgent evaluation If a patient is taking more than their prescribed dosage of opioids or showing signs of aberrant behavior, before deciding to change therapy, look for the following \"red flags\": Progressive numbness or weakness Progressive changes in bowel or bladder function Unexplained weight loss History of internal malignancy that has not been re-staged Signs of/risk factors for infection (fever, recent skin or urinary infection, immunosuppression, IV drug use) Ensure screening and treatment is offered for conditions that can complicate pain management before initiating opioid taper:1, 3, 4 Mental health disorders (e.g., PTSD, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders) If suicidal, then activate suicide prevention plan. If high suicide risk or actively suicidal, consult with mental health provider before beginning taper. Opioid use disorder (OUD) and other substance use disorders (SUD) The lifetime prevalence for OUD among patients receiving long-term opioid therapy is estimated to be about 41%: approximately 28% for mild sympt oms, 10% for moderate symptoms and 3.5% for severe symptoms of OUD. Patients with chronic pain who develop OUD from opioid analgesic therapy need to have BOTH pain and OUD addr essed. Either tapering the opioid analgesic or continuing to prescribe the opioid without providing OUD treatment may increase the risk of overdose and other adverse events. Refer to DSM 5 criteria for OUD. 3 Use a shared decision-making approach to discuss options for OUD treatment: - First-line: Medication Assisted Therapy (MAT) Injectable Naltrexone (Vivitrol\u00ae) - MAT can be provided in a variety of treatment settings including: residential SUD treatment, in tensive outpatient SUD treatment, regular SUD specialty care clinic, primary care or general mental health clinic, or federally regulated opioid treatment program. *Methadone must be provided through a federally regulated opioid treatment program for OUD therapy.\"Moral injury\" (inner conflict) An act of transgression that leads to serious inner conflic t typically brought on by: - Betrayal, disproportionate violence , incidents involving civilians, within-rank violence Treatment via psychologists or chaplains is available C entral sensitization (e .g., fibromyalgia, chronic headaches, and likely many other types of complex chronic pain) M edical complications (e.g., lung disease, hepatic disease, renal disease, or fall risk) S leep disorders including sleep apnea When a decision is made t o taper, special attention must be given to ensure that the Veteran does not f eel abandoned . Prior t o an y changes being made in opioid pr escribing , a discussion should occur bet ween the V eteran, family members/caregivers, and the provider either during a face-to- face appointment or on the telephone. Using all the following strategies will help in the transition: Discussion Ask about goals Educate the Veteran Listen t o the Veteran's story Let the Veteran know that you believe that their pain is real Include family members or other supporters in the discussion Acknowledge theVeteran's fears about tapering [use Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques] Draw out their goals for life (not just being pain-free) Have the Veteran fill out the P ersonal Health Inventory (PHI)* Ask how we can support them during the taper Use Bio-Psycho-Social Model - e.g., PHI's \"Whole Health\" approach* Offer Veterans pain education groups [especially Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for Pain, if available] Offer physical therapy and Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) interventions such as: - acupuncture, meditation, yoga Slowly tapering opioids to reduce opioid risks while not \"cutting off\" theVeteran Offer non-opioid pain medications when appropriate ** Commit to working with the Veteran on other options for improved function and some decrease in pain *PHI's Whole Health Approach: http://www.va.gov/PATIENTCENTEREDCARE/explore/about-whole-health.asp **Pain Management Opioid Safety VA Education Guide 2014, 5-6: https://vaww.portal2.va.gov/sites/ad/SitePages/Pain%20Management.aspx 56Considerations when formulating an opioid taper plan: Determine if the initial goal is a dose reduction or complete discontinuation. If initial goal is det ermined to be a dose reduction, subsequent regular reassessment may indicate that complete discontinuation is more suitable. Several factors go into the speed of taper selected: - Slower, more gradual tapers are often the most tolerable and can be completed over several months to years based on the opioid dose. - The longer the duration of previous opioid therapy, the longer the taper may take. Most commonly, tapering will involve dose reduction of 5% to 20% every 4 weeks. More rapid tapers may be required in certain instances like drug diversion, illegal activities, or situa tions where the risks of continuing the opioid outweigh the risks of a rapid taper. Document the rationale for the opioid taper and the opioid taper schedule in the Veteran's medical r ecord. Provide opioid overdose education and prescribe naloxone to patients at increased risk of overdose. Strongly caution patients that it takes as little as a week to lose their tolerance and that they are at risk of an overdose if they resume their original dose. Patients are at an increased risk of overdose during this process secondary to reduced tolerance to opioids and the availability of opioids and heroin in the community.7Example Tapers for Opioids5-9 Slowest Taper (over years) Reduce by 2 to 10% every 4 to 8 weeks with pauses in taper as needed Consider for patients taking high doses of long-acting opioids for many yearsSlower Taper (over months or years) Reduce by 5 to 20% every 4 weeks with pauses in taper as needed MOST COMMON TAPERFaster Taper (over weeks) **** Reduce by 10 to 20% every week Rapid Taper (over days) **** Reduce by 20 to 50% of first dose if needed, then reduce by 10 to 20% every day Ex: morphine SR 90 mg Q8h = 270 MEDD Month 1: 90 mg SR qam, 75 mg noon, 90 mg qpm [5% reduction] * Month 2: 75 mg SR qam, 75 mg noon, 90 mg qpm Month 3: 75 mg SR (60 mg+15 mg) Q8h Month 4: 75 mg SR qam, 60 mg noon, 75 mg qpm Month 5: 60 mg SR qam, 60 mg noon, 75 mg qpm Month 6: 60 mg SR Q8h Month 7: 60 mg SR qam, 45 mg noon, 60 mg qpm Month 8: 45 mg SR qam, 45 mg noon, 60 mg qpm Month 9: 45 mg SR Q8h **Ex: morphine SR 90 mg Q8h = 270 75 mg (60 mg+15 mg)SR Q8h [16% reduction] Month 2: 60 mg SR Q8hMonth 3: 45 mg SR Q8hMonth 4: 30 mg SR Q8hMonth 5: 15 mg SR Q8hMonth 6: 15 mg 7: 15mg ***Ex: morphine SR 90 mg Q8h = 270 MEDD Week 1: 75 mg SR Q8h [16% reduction]Week 2: 60 mg SR (15 mg x 4) Q8h Week 3: 45 mg SR (15 mg x 3) Q8h Week 4: 30 mg SR (15 mg x 2) Q8h Week 5: 15 mg SR Q8hWeek 6: 15 mg SR Q12hWeek 7: 15 mg SR QHS x 7 days, then stop ***Ex: morphine SR 90 mg Q8h = 270 MEDD Day 1: 60 mg SR (15 mg x 4) Q8h [33% reduction] Day 2: 45 mg SR (15 mg x 3) Q8h Day 3: 30 mg SR (15 mg x 2) Q8h Day 4: 15 mg SR Q8hDays 5-7: 15 mg SR Q12hDays 8-11: 15 mg SR QHS, then stop *** *Continue the taper based on Veteran response. Pauses in the taper may allow the patient time to acquire new skills for management of pain and emotional distress while allowing for neurobiological equilibration. **Continue following this rate of taper until off the morphine or the desired dose of opioid is reached. ***May consider morphine IR 15 mg \u00bd tablet (7.5 mg) twice daily. ****Rapid tapers can cause withdrawal effects and patients should be treated with adjunctive medications to minimize these effects; may need to consider admitting the patient for inpatient care. If patients are prescribed both long-acting and short-acting opioids, the decision about which formulation to be tapered first should be individualized based on medical history, mental health diagnoses, and patient preference. Data shows that overdose risk is greater with long-acting preparations.8Communicate the opioid taper plan to the Veteran Example: Veteran is currently taking morphine SR 60 mg, 1 tablet every 8 hours. Goal is to reduce dose of morphine to SR 30 mg every 8 hours using a slow taper. Dose will be reduced by 15 mg every 10 days. Using morphine SR 15 mg tablets, follow the schedule below: Morning Afternoon Evening Days 1 to 10 4 tablets = 60 mg 3 tablets = 45 mg 4 tablets = 60 mg Days 11 to 20 3 tablets = 45 mg 3 tablets = 45 mg 4 tablets = 60 mg Days 21 to 30 3 tablets = 45 mg 3 tablets = 45 mg 3 tablets = 45 mg Scenario 1: Veteran is tolerating the taper 9Scenario 2: Veteran is resisting further reduction *If the Veteran is resisting further dose reductions, explore the reason for the reluctance: medical (increased pain), mental health (worsening depression, anxiety, etc.), and substance use disorder (SUD)/opioid use disorder (OUD). Refer to OUD Provider Education Guide on VA PBM Academic Detailing SharePoint for more information. https://vaww.portal2.va.gov/sites/ad/SitePages/OUD.aspx **If possible, the Veteran should be activ ely involved in skills training and/or have a comprehensive pain care plan. Follow up with the Veteran during the taper: Follow Up Slowest Taper (over years)Slower Taper (over mon ths)Faster Taper (over weeks)Rapid Taper (over days) When 1 to 4 weeks after starting taper then monthly before each reduction1 to 4 weeks after starting taper then monthly before each reductionWeekly before each dose reductionDaily before each dose reduction or if available offer inpatient admission Who PACT Team* How Clinic and/or telephone**Clinic and/or telephone**Clinic and/or telephone**Hospital, clinic or telephone** What Patient function,*** pain intensity, sleep, physical activity, personal goals, and stress level *Follow-up for tapering is recommended to be a team function with various team members taking on roles in which they have demonstrated specific competencies. Mental health practitioners may need to be included in the follow-up plan. **Providers will need to determine whether a telephone or in-clinic appointment is appropriate based on the risk category of the Veteran. A Veteran with high risk due to a medical condition may have decompensation during the taper and may require a clinic visit over telephone follow-up. If there are issues with the Veteran obtaining outside prescriptions or they are displaying other aberrant behaviors during the taper, providing follow-up in a clinic visit may be more optimal than a telephone visit. ***Quality of Life Scale for patients with pain: https://www.theacpa.org/uploads/documents/Quality_of_Life_Scale.pdf10Manage withdrawal symptoms during the taper:10 Short-term oral medications can be utilized to assist with managing the withdrawal symptoms, especially when prescribing fast tapers.
