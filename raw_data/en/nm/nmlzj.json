Major brands like Snapple now promise to ''enlighten your senses'' by brewing herbs like ginkgo biloba into bottles of iced tea. Celestial Seasonings urges consumers to steep away their stresses with kava, a sedative root from the South Seas now found in its Tension Tamer cocktail. Even Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble are working on fruit-flavored tonics to soothe the pain of aging baby boomers with stiff knees by adding glucosamine, a building block of cartilage. The SoBe beverage line of PepsiCo offers elixirs with herbs like St. John's wort, appealing to New Age enthusiasts looking for Wisdom and Karma, as the drinks are called. And Dannon is working on a new superyogurt intended to enhance the immune system. The migration of herbal medicines from chalky pills sold in health food stores to a rainbow of fruity juices and snacks has been slowly gathering momentum for years. But with the marketing muscle of the nation's biggest food makers behind them, these products are quickly catapulting out of their niche markets and into the coolers of every supermarket and convenience store in the nation. The market for functional beverages -- drinks that promise health benefits beyond their inherent nutritional value -- has nearly doubled in the last four years, from $2.68 billion in 1997 to $4.7 billion in 2000, according to Frost & Sullivan, a market research firm. Sales of functional foods have followed suit, rising from $11.91 billion in 1995 to $23.4 billion last year. Both categories are expected to grow by at least 20 percent this year, according to Frost, offering a serious lift to a food industry that has been a bit listless of late. The Food and Drug Administration has never approved many of the herbs and other substances in the new products as allowable additives. And while the agency has never determined that they are safe to eat, it has not sought to ban them, either, so food companies have the right to add them to their products. Agency officials said that they had not meddled with most products because there had been no reports of consumers being seriously hurt by them. ''There's a gray area here,'' said Dr. George Pauli, an F.D.A. food safety official. ''There's no reason that we would expect any acute reactions. What we're more concerned about is if people consume this over their lifetime, will it eventually catch up with them?'' In a report last July, the General Accounting Office criticized the F.D.A. for providing ''limited assurances'' of the safety of functional foods. Moreover, if consumers had been hurt by any such foods, the F.D.A. might never know about it, the report said. Food companies are not required to disclose that information. Under the law, they need only determine, to their own satisfaction, that the ingredients they put in foods are safe. Unlike the many herbal medicines that contain the same ingredients, the new drinks rarely carry recommended doses on their labels. Even labels that note how much of a particular herb is inside often remain quiet about the concentration of the extract. ''For substances that cause physiological effects, there is sometimes a small margin between an effect that is safe and one that is harmful,'' Dr. Pauli said. Ever since the advent of vitamin-enriched white bread and fortified milk, companies have been bolstering drinks and foods with vitamins and minerals, drawing on decades of scientific research. This new wave of novel additives, by contrast, is accompanied by only a meager understanding of their efficacy and side effects. Indeed, many products make it to market well before any definitive studies on their ingredients take place. Some scientists, lawyers and critics have noted that the big companies have been adding herbs in such low doses that they probably pose no risk at all. But that also means the herbals may be of little benefit. ''I would argue they are putting one over on consumers either way,'' said Henry I. Miller, a fellow at the Hoover Institute and a former F.D.A. official. Pepsi's SoBe Lean boasts on a product tag that it ''acts like liquid liposuction.'' Made from the rind of garcinia cambogia, a pumpkinlike fruit with a questionable reputation for promoting weight loss, the product supposedly suppresses the appetite and inhibits the body's synthesis of fat. ''Is it really going to be a liquid liposuction?'' said John Bello, SoBe's founder. ''We don't claim that, it's just a playful theme.'' Initial steps taken by Coke and Pepsi into nutraceuticals, as the new foods and beverages are called, could not have been more different. Pepsi acquired the South Beach Beverage Company last October. Since then, it has brought drinks like SoBe Adrenaline Rush, which contains the stimulant guarana, into dozens of new markets, hoping to attract the college crowd in search of a late-night lift. On the other end of the spectrum, Coke formed a partnership with Procter & Gamble earlier this spring. The companies are now preparing to introduce a drink called Elations, which promises to ease the aches and pains of the nation's aging population. Each bottle of Elations contains 1,500 milligrams of glucosamine, a dietary supplement that has been popular among people with arthritis for years. A study published this year in the British journal Lancet suggested that glucosamine slowed cartilage erosion, and Elations is being tested in Cape Coral, Fla., under the slogan ''Joy for Joints.'' Douglas N. Daft, Coke's chief executive, has depicted Elations as the equivalent of youth in a bottle, and hopes it will eventually be available in every gas station, supermarket and convenience store in America. ''Baby boomers don't want to grow old,'' Mr. Daft said. ''They're looking for the very thing that will help that desire, something that will make the joints ache a little less.'' Procter officials insist that sound science is what distinguishes Elations from the many herbal concoctions currently transforming the market. In fact, in Cape Coral, Elations is sold alongside dietary supplement pills, not near the juice or soda. Still, some scientists worry that glucosamine could elevate blood sugar levels in diabetics. A warning label on Elations bottles advises diabetics to talk to their doctor before consuming it. The National Institutes of Health is conducting a four-year study on glucosamine. But neither Coke nor Procter felt they could afford to wait for the results. ''The game will be over if anybody isn't in it by then,'' said Dr. Greg S. Allgood, assistant director of Procter's Nutrition Science Institute. Some large companies already feel overtaken by smaller food companies that have seized upon the growing consumer fascination with foods that carry a healthful aura. ''We have to wake up and re-establish our credibility here,'' said Eric Leventhal, a Dannon vice president. The company is testing a superyogurt packed with 10 billion live bacteria cultures, which supposedly stave off sickness. The big food and beverage companies have generally stayed away from the additives that most concern scientists. But even the ingredients they do use can cause problems. Studies have shown that St. John's wort, for example, reduces the efficacy of nearly 50 percent of medications. And some scientists and government officials are worried that numerous smaller companies are adding far more dangerous supplements to drinks. A number of less common teas and sports drinks contain ma huang and guarana, a combination that some scientists say could in rare cases lead to permanent injury or death. In 1998, Shane Garrett, a 21-year-old dental lab technician, drank a bottle of Ripped Force, a drink containing both ingredients, and then started working out. Thirty minutes later, he went into cardiac arrest, leading to permanent brain damage that left him with no short-term memory and the intellectual capacity of an 8-year-old, according to his lawyer. The drink, sold at gyms and the GNC chain, sells under the slogan ''Thunder through your workouts.'' Mr. Garrett has filed a lawsuit against the manufacturer of Ripped Force, Weider Nutrition International, which declined to comment because of the litigation. ''It's marketed like a sports drink and consumed like a sports drink,'' said Andrew W. Hutton, Mr. Garrett's lawyer. ''But it is dangerous.'' Scientists note there are also potential problems with drinks that have less dangerous stimulants like guarana, a natural form of caffeine, or sedatives like kava, both of which are found in SoBe and Snapple drinks. In California, prosecutors brought charges against two motorists last year for driving under the influence of kava tea, prompting a consumer products trade group to warn that the calming root can lead to drowsy driving. Some experts argue that with larger companies entering the market, the momentum will build to describe the contents and suggested doses of functional foods more thoroughly. Nevertheless, the very notion of mixing medicines into foods is anathema to some purists. ''It's appalling,'' said Varro E. Tyler, a professor emeritus at Purdue University who specializes in botanical medicines. ''We don't put Viagra in soup or Prozac in oatmeal, and we shouldn't put in these "}
