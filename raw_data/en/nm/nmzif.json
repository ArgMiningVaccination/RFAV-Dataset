B vitamins are the \"STRESS\" vitamin! Methyl B Complex is the #1 best seller in my practice for the following reasons: 1) Improves Energy Levels! 2) Improves Mood. The B vitamins are cofactors in producing Serotonin and Dopamine, the \"happy\" brain neurotransmitters. 3) Reduces Anxiety 4) Improves Focus 3) Reduces sugar & carb cravings, so you won't be dreaming of. This is HUGE because it helps keep you on track with a healthy diet! 4) Promotes a detox pathway in the body, called METHYLATION. This process reduces the level of an inflammatory amino acid called homocysteine (cardiac inflammatory marker). I often follow homocysteine levels on my patients' bloodwork to monitor their progress (lower the better, with an ideal level being 6). Methyl B Complex has all the B vitamins in the methylated form, which is the preferred form given the high incidence of MTHFR gene mutation in the population. 50% of the population has one or more copies of the MTHFR gene mutation. To learn more about Methylation and the MTHFR Gene, please watch my video on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlu7k-zhUd4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlu7k-zhUd4) Most people benefit from taking 1 capsule daily (ideally after breakfast or lunch). B vitamins are water-soluble, meaning the extra will be excreted in your urine. You may notice your urine turning bright yellow, which is normal when taking this supplement. To try our Methyl B Complex, you can order a 2 month supply here: Or a 4 month supply here: I've been taking Methyl B Complex daily for years! It definitely boosts my energy, mood, and concentration! I only wish I knew about it back in med school and residency! Hope you see great benefits as well! Warm regards, Rajsree Nambudripad, MD "}
