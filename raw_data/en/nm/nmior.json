Reaction CuII salt, PLN reacts with CuII to give [Cu(PLN)(bipy)(H2O)]2(NO3)2\u00b74H2O (2). 1 and 2 were characterized by elemental analysis, IR, ESI-MS spectra. Their crystal structures were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction methods. The in vitro cytotoxicity of PLN, 1 and 2 against seven human tumour cell lines was assayed. The metal-based compounds exhibit enhanced cytotoxicity vs. that of free PLN, suggesting that these compounds display synergy in the combination of metal ions with PLN. The binding properties of PLN, 1 and 2 to DNA were investigated through UV-vis, fluorescence, CD spectra, and gel mobility shift assay, which indicated that 1 and 2 were non-covalent binding and mainly intercalated the neighboring base pairs of DNA. PLN, 1 and 2 exhibit inhibition activity to topoisomerase I (TOPO I), but 1 and 2 were "}
