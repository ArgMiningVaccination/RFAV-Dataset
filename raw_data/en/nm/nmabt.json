Originally identified for its role in the process of blood clot formation (\"K\" is derived from the Danish word \"koagulation\"), vitamin K is essential for the functioning of several [proteins](../glossary#protein) involved in physiological processes that encompass, but are not limited to, the regulation of blood clotting ( [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) ) [(1)](#references) . Naturally occurring forms of vitamin K include a number of vitamers known as vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 (Figure 1 ). Vitamin K1 or phylloquinone is [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) by plants and is the predominant form in the diet. Vitamin K2 includes a range of vitamin K forms collectively referred to as menaquinones. Most menaquinones are synthesized by human [intestinal microbiota](../glossary#intestinal-microbiota) and found in [fermented](../glossary#fermentation) foods and in animal products. Menaquinones differ in length from 1 to 13 repeats of 5-carbon units in the side chain of the molecules. These forms of vitamin K are designated menaquinone-n (MK-n), where n stands for the (MK-2 to MK-13) [(2, 3)](#reference2) . Widely used in animal husbandry, the synthetic compound known as menadione (vitamin K3 ) is a provitamin that needs to be converted to menaquinone-4 (MK-4) to be active (Figure 1 ) [(4)](#reference4) . Function Vitamin K functions as a [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for the enzyme, -glutamylcarboxylase, which [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyst) the -carboxyglutamic acid (Gla). Vitamin K-dependent -carboxylation that occurs only on specific glutamic acid residues in identified vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDP) is critical for their ability to bind [calcium](../minerals/calcium) [(5)](#reference5). Vitamin K oxidation-reduction cycle Although vitamin K is a [fat](../glossary#lipid)-soluble [vitamin](../glossary#vitamin), the body stores very small amounts that are rapidly depleted without regular dietary intake. Perhaps because of its limited ability to store vitamin K, the body recycles it through a process called the vitamin K-epoxide cycle (Figure 2). The vitamin K cycle allows a small amount of vitamin K to be reused many times for [protein](../glossary#protein) [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation), thus decreasing the dietary requirement. Briefly, vitamin K hydroquinone (reduced form) is [oxidized](../glossary#oxidation) to vitamin K epoxide (oxidized form). The reaction enables -glutamylcarboxylase to carboxylate selective glutamic acid residues on vitamin K-dependent proteins. The recycling of vitamin K epoxide (oxidized form) to hydroquinone (reduced form) is carried out by two reactions that reduce vitamin K epoxide (KO) to vitamin K quinone and then to vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2; Figure 2). Additionally, the [enzyme](../glossary#enzyme) vitamin K-epoxide reductase (VKOR) [catalyzes](../glossary#catalyst) the reduction of KO to vitamin K quinone and may be involved \u2014 as well as another yet-to-defined reductase \u2014 in the production of KH2 from vitamin K quinone [(6, 7)](#reference6). The [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) drug warfarin acts as a vitamin K [antagonist](../glossary#antagonist) by inhibiting VKOR activity, hence preventing vitamin K recycling (see [Coagulation](#coagulation)). Coagulation The ability to bind [calcium](../minerals/calcium) [ions](../glossary#ion) (Ca2+) is required for the activation of the several vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, or [proteins](../glossary#protein), in the [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) (clotting) cascade. The term 'coagulation cascade' refers to a series of events, each dependent on the other, that stops bleeding through clot formation. Vitamin K-dependent - [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) of specific glutamic acid residues in those proteins makes it possible for them to bind calcium. Factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X make up the core of the coagulation cascade. Protein Z appears to enhance the action of thrombin (the activated form of prothrombin) by promoting its association with [phospholipids](../glossary#phospholipid) in [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane). Protein C and protein S are [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) proteins that provide control and balance in the coagulation cascade; protein Z also has an anticoagulatory function. Control mechanisms for the coagulation cascade exist since uncontrolled clotting may be as life threatening as uncontrolled bleeding. Vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors are [synthesized](../glossary#synthesis) in the liver. Consequently, severe liver disease results in lower blood levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and an increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for uncontrolled bleeding ( [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage)) [(8)](#reference8). Oral anticoagulant therapy with vitamin K antagonists Some people are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of forming clots, which could block the flow of blood in arteries of the heart, brain, or lungs, resulting in [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) (heart attack), [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), or pulmonary embolism, respectively. Abnormal clotting is not related to excessive vitamin K intake, and there is no known toxicity associated with vitamin K1 or vitamin K2 (see [Toxicity](#toxicity)). Some oral [anticoagulants](../glossary#anticoagulant), such as warfarin (Jantoven, formerly known as Coumadin), inhibit [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) by [antagonizing](../glossary#antagonist) the action of vitamin K. Warfarin prevents the recycling of vitamin K by blocking VKOR activity, thus creating a functional vitamin K deficiency (Figure 2). Inadequate -carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins interferes with the coagulation cascade, which inhibits blood clot formation. Large quantities of dietary or [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin K can overcome the anticoagulant effect of vitamin K [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist); thus, patients taking these drugs are cautioned against consuming very large or highly variable quantities of vitamin K (see [Drug interactions](#drug-interactions)). Experts now advise a reasonably constant dietary intake of vitamin K that meets current dietary recommendations (90-120 g/day) for patients taking vitamin K antagonists like warfarin [(9, 10)](#reference9). Skeletal formation and prevention of soft tissue calcification Vitamin K-dependent - [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) is essential to several bone-related protein) by [osteoblasts](../glossary#osteoblast) (bone-forming cells); the synthesis of osteocalcin is regulated by the active form of [vitamin D](vitamin-D), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol). The calcium-binding vitamin K-dependent -carboxylation of three glutamic acid residues. Although its function in bone mineralization is not fully understood, osteocalcin is required for the growth and maturation of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals (see [Osteoporosis](#osteoporosis-prevention)) [(11)](#reference11). Protein S appears to play a role in the breakdown of bone mediated by [osteoclasts](../glossary#osteoclast). Individuals with inherited protein S deficiency suffer complications related to increased blood clotting, as well as [osteonecrosis](../glossary#osteonecrosis) [(12, 13)](#reference12). Protein S can bind and activate [receptors](../glossary#receptor) of the TAM family that are involved in [phagocytosis](../glossary#phagocytosis). [Mutations](../glossary#mutation) in TAM receptors can result in visual impairment, defective [spermatogenesis](../glossary#spermatogenesis), [autoimmune disorders](../glossary#autoimmune-disease), and [platelet](../glossary#platelet) disorders [(14)](#reference14). MGP has been found in [cartilage](../glossary#cartilage), bone, and soft tissue, including blood vessel walls, where it is synthesized and secreted by vascular smooth muscle cells. MGP is involved in the inhibition of [calcification](../glossary#calcification) at various sites, including cartilage, vessel wall, skin elastic fibers, and the trabecular meshwork in the eye (see [Vascular calcification](#vascular-calcification-prevention)) [(15, 16)](#reference15). several VKDPs, including MGP, have been associated with calcification sites in arteries, skin, kidneys, and eyes in certain inherited conditions, such as pseudoxanthoma elasticum and beta-thalassemia [(17, 18)](#reference17). The vitamin K-dependent proteins, GRP and periostin, are also synthesized in bone tissue, but their roles in bone metabolism are still unclear [(19, 20)](#reference19). Expressed in normal human skin and vascular tissues, GRP has been colocalized with abnormal mineral deposits in the extracellular matrix in calcified arteries and calcified skin lesions [(21)](#reference21). Expressed in most connective tissues, including skin and bone, periostin was initially associated with cell adhesion and migration. This VKDP also appears to promote [angiogenesis](../glossary#angiogenesis) (formation of new blood vessels) during cardiac valve degeneration and tumor growth [(22, 23)](#reference22). Current research suggests that reduced -glutamylcarboxylase activity and/or lower vitamin K [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) may impair the activity of VKDPs and contribute to bone mineralization defects and abnormal soft tissue calcification (see [Disease Prevention](#disease-prevention)) [(24)](#reference24). Regulation of cellular functions Growth arrest-specific gene 6 [protein](../glossary#protein) (Gas6) is a vitamin K-dependent protein that was identified in 1993. It has been found throughout the nervous system, as well in the heart, lungs, stomach, kidneys, and [cartilage](../glossary#cartilage). Identified as a ligand of the TAM family of transmembrane tyrosine kinase [receptors](../glossary#receptor), Gas6 appears to be a cellular growth regulation factor with [cell-signaling](../glossary#cell-signaling) activities. Gas6 has been involved in diverse cellular functions, including [phagocytosis](../glossary#phagocytosis), cell adhesion, cell [proliferation](../glossary#proliferation), and protection against [apoptosis](../glossary#apoptosis) [(5)](#reference5). It may also play important roles in the developing and aging nervous system (reviewed in [25](#reference25)). Further, Gas6 appears to regulate [platelet](../glossary#platelet) signaling and vascular [hemostasis](../glossary#hemostasis) [(26)](#reference26). Expressed in most tissues and involved in many cellular functions, Gas6 has also been linked to several pathological conditions, including clot formation (thrombogenesis), [atherosclerosis](../health-disease/atherosclerosis), chronic [inflammation](../glossary#inflammation), and [cancer](../glossary#cancer) growth [(27-29)](#reference27). Deficiency Overt vitamin K deficiency results in impaired blood clotting, usually demonstrated by laboratory tests that measure clotting time. Symptoms include easy bruising and bleeding that may be manifested as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in the urine, blood in the stool, tarry black stools, or extremely heavy menstrual bleeding. In infants, vitamin K deficiency may result in life-threatening bleeding within the skull (intracranial [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage)) [(8)](#reference8). Multiple [biomarkers](../glossary#biomarker) of vitamin K [status](../glossary#status) exist (reviewed in [30](#reference30)), but only impaired blood [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) is used as a measure of clinical vitamin K deficiency. Adults Vitamin K deficiency is uncommon in healthy adults for a number of reasons: (1) vitamin K is widespread in foods (see [Food sources](#food-sources)); (2) the vitamin K cycle conserves vitamin K (see [Vitamin K oxidation-reduction cycle](#vitamin-K-oxidation-reduction-cycle)); and (3) [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria) that normally inhabit the large intestine [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) menaquinones (vitamin K2), although it is unclear whether significant amounts are absorbed and utilized (see [Food sources](#food-sources)). Adults at [risk](../glossary#risk) for vitamin K deficiency include those taking vitamin K [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist) and individuals with significant liver damage or disease [(8)](#reference8). Additionally, individuals with [fat](../glossary#lipid) [malabsorption disorders](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome), including [inflammatory bowel disease](../glossary#inflammatory-bowel-disease) and [cystic fibrosis,](../glossary#cystic-fibrosis) may be at increased risk of vitamin K deficiency [(31-34)](#reference31). Infants Newborn babies who are exclusively breast-fed are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) for vitamin K deficiency because human milk is relatively low in vitamin K compared to formula. Newborn infants, in general, have low vitamin K [status](../glossary#status) for the following reasons: (1) vitamin K transport across the [placental](../glossary#placenta) barrier is limited; (2) liver storage of vitamin K is very low; (3) the vitamin K cycle may not be fully functional in newborns, especially premature infants; (4) the vitamin K content of breast milk is low, and immature gut flora [(5](#reference5), [35)](#reference35). Infants whose mothers are on [anticonvulsant](../glossary#anticonvulsant) medication to prevent [seizures](../glossary#seizure) are also at risk for vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K deficiency in newborns may result in a bleeding disorder called vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) of the newborn (reviewed in [36](#reference36)). Because VKDB is life threatening and easily prevented, the American Academy of Pediatrics and a number of similar international organizations recommend that an intramuscular dose of phylloquinone (vitamin K1) be administered to all newborns shortly after birth (reviewed in [37](#reference37)). Controversies around vitamin K administration to newborns Vitamin K and childhood leukemia: In the early 1990s, two [retrospective studies](../glossary#retrospective-study) were published suggesting a possible association between phylloquinone injections in newborns and the development of childhood [leukemia](../glossary#leukemia) and other forms of childhood [cancer](../glossary#cancer). However, two large retrospective studies in the US and Sweden, which reviewed the medical records of 54,000 and 1.3 million children, respectively, found no evidence of a relationship between childhood cancers and phylloquinone injections at birth [(38, 39)](#reference38). Moreover, a pooled analysis of six [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study), including 2,431 children diagnosed with childhood cancer and 6,338 cancer-free children, found no evidence that phylloquinone injections for newborns increased the [risk](../glossary#risk) of childhood leukemia [(40)](#reference40). In a policy statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that routine vitamin K [prophylaxis](../glossary#prophylaxis) for newborns be continued because VKDB is life threatening and the risks of cancer are unproven and unlikely [(41)](#reference41). In the last decade, physicians have reported a rise in late-onset cases of VKDB due to an increasing trend of parental omission or refusal of newborn vitamin K prophylaxis [(42, 43)](#reference42). Lower doses of vitamin K1 for premature infants: The results of two studies of vitamin K levels in premature infants suggest that the standard initial dose of phylloquinone (vitamin K1) for full-term infants (1.0 mg) may be too high for premature infants [(44, 45)](#reference44). These findings have led some experts to suggest the use of an initial phylloquinone dose of 0.3 mg/kg for infants with birth weights of less than 1,000 g (2 lbs, 3 oz), and an initial phylloquinone dose of 0.5 mg would probably prevent hemorrhagic disease in newborns [(44)](#reference44). Yet, additional studies are needed to determine the best vitamin K prophylaxis in premature infants [(46)](#reference46). The Adequate Intake (AI) In 2001, the US Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) established the adequate intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) level for vitamin K based on phylloquinone intake levels in healthy individuals (Table 1). The AI for infants was based on estimated intake of vitamin K from breast milk [(47)](#reference47). The FNB did not consider menaquinone intakes; data on menaquinone consumption are limited [(48)](#reference48). Table 1. Adequate Intake (AI) for Vitamin K | Life Stage || Age || Males (g/day) || Females || || | | Infants || 7-12 months || 2.5 || 2.5 | | Children || 1-3 years || 30 || 30 | | Children || 4-8 years || 55 || 55 | | Children || 9-13 years || 60 || 60 | | Adolescents || 14-18 years || 75 || 75 | | Adults || 19 years and older || 120 || 90 | | Pregnancy || 18 years and younger || - || 75 | | Pregnancy || 19 years and older || - || 90 | | Breast-feeding || 18 years and younger || - || 75 | | Breast-feeding || 19 years and older || - || 90 | Disease Prevention Osteoporosis The discovery of vitamin K-dependent [proteins](../glossary#protein) in bone has led to research on the role of vitamin K in maintaining bone health. Vitamin K and bone health: observational studies Vitamin K1: [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have found a relationship between phylloquinone and age-related bone loss ( [osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis)). The Nurses' Health Study followed more than 72,000 women for 10 years. In an analysis of this cohort, women whose phylloquinone intakes were lower than 109 micrograms/day (g/day) had a 30% higher [risk](../glossary#risk) for hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) compared to women with intakes equal to or above 109 g/day [(49)](#reference49). Another prospective study in over 800 elderly men and women, followed in the Framingham Heart Study for seven years, found that participants with dietary vitamin K intakes in the highest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) (median, 254 g/day) had a 65% lower risk of hip fracture than those with intakes in the lowest quartile (median, 56 g/day) [(50)](#reference50). Osteoporotic fractures are often linked to a reduction in bone mineralization. Yet, the investigators found no association between dietary phylloquinone intake and [bone mineral density](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) (BMD) in the Framingham subjects [(50)](#reference50). While other studies failed to observe associations between dietary phylloquinone intake and measures of bone strength, BMD, or fracture incidence [(51, 52)](#reference51), the [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of a cohort of 3,199 middle-aged women found that subjects in the highest quartile of dietary phylloquinone intake had significantly greater hip and [lumbar spine](../glossary#lumbar-spine) BMD than those in the lowest quartile (162 vs. 59 g/day) [(53)](#reference53). Moreover, cross-sectional and [case-control studies](../glossary#case-control-study) have reported associations between higher phylloquinone intakes and lower incidence of hip fracture [(54, 55)](#reference54). However, because green leafy vegetables are the primary dietary source of phylloquinone and because they are usually part of a balanced diet, high phylloquinone consumption may simply be an indicator of healthy eating habits, which may \u2014 rather than phylloquinone itself \u2014 account for all or part of the association reported in observational studies [(56)](#reference56). The few studies that measured [plasma](../glossary#plasma) phylloquinone generally found that higher circulating levels were associated with lower fracture risk [(15](#reference15), [57, 58)](#reference57). For example, the incidence of [vertebral](../glossary#vertebral) fractures was inversely correlated with lumbar BMD and plasma phylloquinone in a four-year [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that included 379 Japanese women ages 30-88 years [(57)](#reference57). Yet, observational studies are not designed to making causal inferences, and only [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) can evaluate whether phylloquinone may have beneficial effects on bone health (see [Vitamin K supplementation studies and osteoporosis](#vitamin-K-supplementation-osteoporosis)). Vitamin K2: There are few studies on associations between menaquinones (vitamin K2) and bone health, perhaps because of the limited number of dietary sources of menaquinone-4 (MK-4), the main form of vitamin K2 present in Western diets. The Japanese food natto, made of cooked soybeans fermented by Bacillus subtilis natto, is rich in MK-7. In a [prospective cohort study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed 944 Japanese women (ages 20-79 years), total hip [BMD](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) at baseline was positively associated with natto intake in postmenopausal women [(59)](#reference59). During the three-year follow-up period, the rate of BMD loss at the [femoral neck](../glossary#femoral-neck) was significantly lower in women consuming natto (>200 g/day of MK-7) compared to non-consumers. No association was found between natto intake and BMD in premenopausal women [(59)](#reference59). Total hip and femoral neck BMD was also reportedly higher in nearly 2,000 Japanese men aged 65 years and older who regularly consumed at least of one pack per day of natto (350 g/day of MK-7) compared to those consuming less than one pack per week (<50 g/day of MK-7) [(60)](#reference60). Yet, increasing natto consumption also maximizes the intake of other dietary compounds (e.g., soy isoflavones) that have potential benefits for skeletal health; thus, there is need to find reliable measures of vitamin K [status](../glossary#status). To date, [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have failed to unequivocally support an association between circulating menaquinone (MK-7 and MK-4) levels and fracture risk [(15](#reference15), [61)](#reference61). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) that pooled the results of four prospective cohort studies and one [nested case-control study](../glossary#nested-case-control-study) found higher total dietary vitamin K intakes to be associated with a lower risk of total fracture ( [RR](../glossary#relative-risk), 0.78; 95% [CI](../glossary#confidence-interval): 0.56, 0.99) [(62)](#reference62). In a recent Japanese cohort study not included in this meta-analysis (i.e., the Murakami Cohort Study), a protective association of dietary vitamin K intake was seen for vertebral fractures (p=0.005); vitamin K intake was not associated with total fracture in women or with either vertebral or total fracture in men [(63)](#reference63). Biomarker of vitamin K status and bone health Total circulating levels of the bone [protein](../glossary#protein), osteocalcin (OC), have been shown to be sensitive markers of bone formation. Several [hormones](../glossary#hormone) and growth factors, including [vitamin D](vitamin-D) but not vitamin K, regulate osteocalcin [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis) by [osteoblasts](../glossary#osteoblast). However, vitamin K is an essential [cofactor](../glossary#cofactor) for the - [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) of three glutamic acid residues in osteocalcin. Undercarboxylation of osteocalcin in human bone and [serum](../glossary#serum) has been linked to poor vitamin K [status](../glossary#status). The degree of osteocalcin -carboxylation is responsive to vitamin K nutritional interventions, and thus is used as a relative indicator of vitamin K status [(11)](#reference11). Circulating levels of uncarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) were found to be higher in postmenopausal women than premenopausal women and markedly higher in women over the age of 70. Also, high ratios of ucOC to total OC (ucOC/OC) appear to be predictive of hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) [risk](../glossary#risk) in elderly women [(64, 65)](#reference64). Although vitamin K deficiency would seem the most likely cause of elevated blood ucOC/OC ratio, some investigators have documented an inverse relationship between biochemical measures of vitamin D nutritional status and ucOC levels, as well as a significant lowering of ucOC/OC ratio by vitamin D supplementation [(66)](#reference66). It has been suggested that increased circulating ucOC/OC ratio could reflect a poor overall nutritional status that would include vitamin D inadequacy, which would explain the above-mentioned observations [(67)](#reference67). However, in several [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled women [(69)](#reference69), vitamin D supplementation failed to decrease ucOC/OC ratios or show any additive effect on ucOC/OC lowering by supplemental vitamin K. Vitamin K supplementation studies and osteoporosis Vitamin K1 supplementation: The review of five [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) that assessed the effect of phylloquinone (vitamin K1) [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) on hip [BMD](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) using doses ranging from 200 g/day to 5,000 g/day for durations of 12 to 36 months found little promising benefit for bone health [(15)](#reference15). Although supplementation with phylloquinone decreased ucOC levels in all five studies, only one study reported an effect of supplemental phylloquinone on BMD [(70)](#reference70). In this study, 150 postmenopausal women were randomized to receive a [placebo](../glossary#placebo), minerals (500 mg/day of calcium, 150 mg/day of magnesium, and 10 mg/day of zinc) plus vitamin D (320 IU/day), or minerals, vitamin D, and phylloquinone (1,000 g/day). The rate of BMD loss at the [femoral neck](../glossary#femoral-neck), but not at the [lumbar spine](../glossary#lumbar-spine), was significantly lower in subjects with supplemental phylloquinone compared to the other two groups. Thus, evidence of a putative benefit of phylloquinone on bone health in older adults is considered weak. None of the studies were designed to assess the effect of phylloquinone on [osteoporotic](../glossary#osteoporosis)-related [fractures](../glossary#fracture). Further investigation may seek to evaluate whether phylloquinone supplementation could improve skeletal health in subjects at high-risk for vitamin K inadequacy (e.g., individuals with [malabsorption syndromes](../glossary#malabsorption-syndrome) name, menatetrenone) are currently used in Japan in the treatment of [osteoporosis](../glossary#osteoporosis) [(71)](#reference71). Accordingly, most [intervention trials](../glossary#intervention-trial) investigating the effect of high-dose MK-4 on bone loss have been conducted in Japanese postmenopausal women. In a three-year [placebo](../glossary#placebo)-controlled trial among postmenopausal women with [osteopenia](../glossary#osteopenia), adding a MK-7 supplement (375 g/day) to combined calcium-vitamin D supplementation did not affect BMD or other bone health parameters despite reductions in [serum](../glossary#serum) ucOC [(72)](#reference72). At present, the potential role for supplemental menaquinones on bone health still needs to be established in large, [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design), and well-controlled trials. A 2019 [systematic review](../glossary#systematic-review) and [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) in postmenopausal women or women with osteoporosis found vitamin K supplementation \u2014 of any form \u2014 lowered risk of clinical [fracture](../glossary#fracture) compared to controls (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.95; 9 trials varying from 6 months to 2 years: 3 using phylloquinone, 5 using MK-4, and 1 using MK-7) [(73)](#reference73). However, no benefit of vitamin K supplementation was seen for vertebral fractures (7 trials) or BMD (22 trials). The authors of this meta-analysis noted that the high [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) of the included trials (i.e., form and dose of vitamin K, use of other supplements and drugs by participants, and treatment length) makes it difficult to inform clinical recommendations [(73)](#reference73). Vitamin K antagonists and bone health Certain oral [anticoagulants](../glossary#anticoagulant), such as warfarin, are known to be [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist) of vitamin K (see [Coagulation](#coagulation)). Few studies have examined chronic use of warfarin and [risk](../glossary#risk) of [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in older women. One study reported no association between long-term warfarin treatment and fracture risk [(74)](#reference74), while another one found a significantly higher risk of rib and [vertebral](../glossary#vertebral) fractures in warfarin users compared to nonusers [(75)](#reference75). Additionally, a study in elderly patients with [atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation) reported that long-term warfarin treatment was associated with a significantly higher risk of [osteoporotic](../health-disease/osteoporosis) fracture in men but not in women [(76)](#reference76). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of the results of 11 published studies found that oral anticoagulation therapy was associated with a very modest reduction in [BMD](../glossary#bone-mineral-density) at the wrist and no change in BMD at the hip or spine [(77)](#reference77). The development of new anticoagulants that do not block vitamin K recycling may offer a safer alternative to the use of vitamin K antagonists [(78)](#reference78). Cardiovascular disease [Observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) examining vitamin K intake in relation to cardiovascular-related mortality have found conflicting results [(48)](#reference48). An [inverse relationship](../glossary#inverse-association) between vitamin K intake and mortality was reported in a US national survey (NHANES III) of 3,401 participants [(79)](#reference79). Adequate vs. inadequate vitamin K intakes (based on sex-specific [AI](../glossary#AI): 90 g/day for women and 120 g/day for men) were associated with a 22% lower risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) (CVD)-related mortality and a 15% lower risk of all-cause mortality. The report also indicated that, while over two-thirds of individuals with chronic kidney disease had vitamin K intakes below the AI, the risk of CVD mortality was 41% lower in those with adequate compared to suboptimal intakes [(79)](#reference79). However, higher vitamin K intakes were not associated with lower CVD mortality in a [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that followed 7,216 older adults at risk for developing CVD [(80)](#reference80). This study associated higher intakes of phylloquinone, but not of menaquinones, with lower risk of all-cause mortality. More recently, in a prospective study that followed a cohort of 33,289 Dutch men and women for an average of 16.8 years (the EPIC-Netherlands), neither phylloquinone intake nor menaquinone intake at baseline was associated with mortality from cardiovascular disease, [coronary heart disease](../health-disease/coronary-heart-disease), [stroke](../health-disease/stroke), or all causes [(81)](#reference81). Yet, a prospective study of 56,048 men and women participating in the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health cohort reported higher phylloquinone intakes to be associated with lower risks of both cardiovascular disease-related mortality and all-cause mortality [(82)](#reference82). Moreover, a few studies have examined the association of fasting circulating phylloquinone with cardiovascular-related or all-cause mortality. In a recent [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of individual participant data from three prospective cohort studies (the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis; the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study, and the Framingham Offspring Study), a blood phylloquinone concentration less than or equal to 0.5 nmol/L (n=1,081) was associated with a 19% higher risk of all-cause mortality compared to a blood concentration >1.0 nmol/L (n=1,698; [83](#reference83)). This analysis did not find circulating phylloquinone to be linked with incident cardiovascular disease [(83)](#reference83). Observational studies offer limited support of an inverse relationship between phylloquinone intake and risk of incident cardiovascular disease, despite high intakes being sometimes regarded as a marker of healthy dietary habits associated with low cardiovascular risk (reviewed in [84](#reference84)). A prospective cohort study of 16,057 Dutch women (ages 49-70 years), followed for a mean period of 8.1 years, found a 9% reduction in risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) per each incremental 10 g/day increase in menaquinone intake [(85)](#reference85). In another earlier Dutch study that examined 4,807 healthy men and women 55 years and older, participants in the highest [tertile](../glossary#tertile) of menaquinone intake (>32.7 g/day) had a 41% lower risk of incident CHD and a 26% lower risk of all-cause mortality than those in the lowest tertile (<21.6 g/day) [(86)](#reference86). In addition, menaquinone intake was found to be inversely associated with aortic [calcification](../glossary#calcification), a major risk factor for CVD [(86)](#reference86). A smaller prospective study among 2,987 Norwegian adults, followed for an average of 10.8 years, reported higher dietary intakes of vitamin K2, but not of vitamin K1, were associated with a lower risk of CHD [(87)](#reference87). While these data are interesting, it is important to note that vitamin K2 may solely be a marker of a heart-healthy diet and might not itself be cardioprotective. Most recently, the prospective Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health Study followed 53,372 older adults for an average of 21 years, finding both phylloquinone and menaquinone intake at baseline to be inversely associated with hospitalizations due to [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) cardiovascular events, including ischemic to determine whether vitamin K1 or vitamin K2 reduces the risk of CHD or cardiovascular-related events like [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) or stroke. Vascular calcification One of the hallmarks of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease) is the presence of [atherosclerotic](../health-disease/atherosclerosis) plaques in arterial walls. Plaque rupture that causes blood clot formation (thrombogenesis) is the usual cause of a [myocardial infarction](../health-disease/heart-attack) (heart attack) or [stroke](../health-disease/stroke). While [calcification](../glossary#calcification) of the plaques occurs as the atherosclerosis progresses, it is unclear whether calcification increases plaque instability and could predict [risk](../glossary#risk) of rupture and thrombogenesis [(89)](#reference89). However, calcification may be predictive of future [cardiovascular](../glossary#cardiovascular) events, especially in those with chronic kidney disease [(90)](#reference90). A [meta-analysis](../glossary#meta-analysis) of 30 [prospective cohort studies](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study), including a total of 218,080 participants, found that the presence of vascular calcification was associated with an overall three- to four-fold increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality [(91)](#reference91). An early population-based study of postmenopausal women (ages, 60-79 years) observed that the younger women (60-69 years) with aortic calcifications had lower vitamin K intakes than those without aortic calcifications, but this was not true for older women (70-79 years) [(92)](#reference92). A prospective cohort study in 807 men and women, 39-45 years of age, did not find any correlation between dietary phylloquinone intake and [coronary artery](../glossary#coronary-artery) calcification, phylloquinone nor menaquinone intake was associated with calcification of breast arteries in a [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) of 1,689 women ages 49-70 years [(94)](#reference94). However, in another cross-sectional study, the upper vs. lowest [quartile](../glossary#quartile) of menaquinone (MK-4 to MK-10) intake (median intakes, 48.5 g/day vs. 18 g/day) was found to be associated with a 20% reduced [prevalence](../glossary#prevalence) of coronary artery calcification in 564 postmenopausal women [(95)](#reference95). Research has uncovered possible mechanisms by which vitamin K may inhibit mineralization (calcification) of vessels while promoting bone mineralization. The potential mechanisms, although not yet fully understood, implicate vitamin K-dependent [proteins](../glossary#protein), including matrix [(96-98)](#reference96). Secreted by various cell types, such as vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in arterial vessel walls, MGP appears to be important for the prevention of calcification of soft tissues, including [cartilage](../glossary#cartilage), vasculature, skin, and trabecular meshwork cells in the eye [(15](#reference15), [99)](#reference99). In MGP knockout mice, conversion of VSMCs into bone-like cells and extensive vessel calcification results in large vessel rupture and premature death. In humans, defective MGP [gene](../glossary#gene) has been linked to Keutel syndrome, a rare inherited condition characterized in particular by abnormal cartilage calcification and pulmonary artery [stenosis](../glossary#stenosis) (narrowing). Calcification prevention by MGP involved several mechanisms, including the binding to calcium crystals and the inhibition of proteins (bone morphogenic proteins; BMPs) known to promote ectopic bone formation (reviewed in [100](#reference100)). Calcium-binding activity of MGP is regulated by two types of modifications (known as post-translational modifications since they take place after protein [synthesis](../glossary#synthesis)): the vitamin K-dependent [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) of up to five Glu residues and the [phosphorylation](../glossary#phosphorylation) of serine residues. A variation in the sequence ( [polymorphism](../glossary#polymorphism)) of the gene for MGP leading to a threonine-to-alanine transition in one of the five Gla domains of the protein may possibly prevent carboxylation and elicit a change in MGP ability to bind calcium. This polymorphism, known as MGPThr83Ala, has been associated with the progression of coronary artery calcification over a mean period of 10.6 years in a community-based prospective study that followed 605 middle-aged men and women [(101)](#reference101). This association was only observed among participants without detectable calcification at baseline and not in those who had baseline calcification [(101)](#reference101). Interestingly, MGPThr83Ala was also associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction and femoral artery calcification in carriers of the genotype [(102)](#reference102). Additionally, a small study initially found that, while undercarboxylated MGP (ucMGP) was absent from the innermost lining of the [carotid arteries](../glossary#carotid-arteries) in healthy subjects, the majority of MGP in the carotid arterial lining of patients with atherosclerosis was undercarboxylated [(103)](#reference103). In another study that examined the association between circulating MGP and incident cardiovascular events in 577 older men and women followed for a mean period of 5.6 years, the risk of cardiovascular disease (i.e., coronary artery disease, [peripheral arterial disease](../glossary#peripheral-arterial-disease), and [cerebrovascular disease](../glossary#cerebrovascular-disease)) was two- to three-fold greater in subjects in the highest vs. lowest [tertile](../glossary#tertile) of [plasma](../glossary#plasma) dephosphorylated and undercarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) [(104)](#reference104). The results of another prospective study suggested that circulating dp-ucMGP may be predictive of mortality risk in subjects with overt vascular disease [(105)](#reference105). Indeed, the risk of cardiovascular-related and all-cause mortality was found to be nearly doubled in subjects with coronary artery disease or stroke in the highest vs. lowest quartile of dp-ucMGP concentrations [(105)](#reference105). Because suboptimal vitamin K nutritional may limit carboxylation and result in biologically inactive ucMGP, it has been speculated that vitamin K [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) may protect against vascular calcification. A three-year, [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), controlled trial investigated the potential effect of vitamin K on the progression of coronary calcification in 401 older, community-dwelling adults (ages, 60-80 years) free of cardiovascular disease at baseline [(106)](#reference106). The participants were [randomized](../glossary#randomized-design) to receive a daily multivitamin plus calcium and vitamin D with or without 500 mg of phylloquinone. Using measurements of coronary artery calcification at baseline and follow up, it was found that phylloquinone supplementation was able to limit the progression of vascular calcification and reduce plasma dp-ucMGP compared to control [(106, 107)](#reference106). Although circulating dp-ucMGP was correlated to various markers of vitamin K status, no association with measures of coronary artery calcification were found [(107)](#reference107). Smaller trials in those at high risk for coronary artery disease [(108)](#reference108) or with existing aortic valve calcification [(109)](#reference109), mellitus](../glossary#diabetes-mellitus) [(110)](#reference110), or kidney disease 112)](#reference111) have reported no benefit of vitamin K2 supplementation on progression of vascular calcification. A meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials found that vitamin K supplementation reduced dp-ucMGP (7 trials), reduced ucOC (4 trials), and decreased progression of vascular calcification (3 trials) [(113)](#reference113). Yet, the authors emphasize that any conclusions from their pooled analysis are limited by the high [heterogeneity](../glossary#heterogeneity) of the trials with respect to the form and dose of vitamin K utilized, as well as the assays that assessed vascular calcification [(113)](#reference113). Thus, further investigations are necessary to examine the role of other vitamin K-dependent proteins (e.g., GRP, periostin, Gas6) in human atherosclerotic plaque calcification and to evaluate the effect of supplemental vitamin K on the progression of vascular calcification and risk of cardiovascular disease. Vitamin K antagonists and vascular calcification Several [cross-sectional studies](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) have reported increased vascular calcium scores (a means to quantify vascular calcification) in chronic users of vitamin K [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist) compared to nonusers (reviewed in [114](#reference114)). Warfarin therapy has also been associated with higher circulating concentrations of dp-ucMGP in a [prospective study](../glossary#prospective-cohort-study) that examined vascular [calcification](../glossary#calcification) in subjects with cardiovascular disease [(105)](#reference105). Newly developed direct inhibitors of [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) factors that do not interfere with VKDP activity may be more suitable than vitamin K antagonists, especially with regards to vascular calcification [(114)](#reference114). Osteoarthritis [Osteoarthritis](../glossary#osteoarthritis), a degenerative joint condition that affects more than 32 million US adults [(115)](#reference115), is characterized by the breakdown of articular [cartilage](../glossary#cartilage) (i.e., cartilage within the joint). Because several vitamin K-dependent [proteins](../glossary#protein) are present in cartilage and in bone [(116)](#reference116), vitamin K inadequacy may have a role in the development of osteoarthritis. A few [observational studies](../glossary#observational-study) have investigated a possible link between vitamin K intake or status and osteoarthritis. A [cross-sectional study](../glossary#cross-sectional-study) among 719 Japanese older adults found dietary intake of vitamin K to be [inversely associated](../glossary#inverse-association) with knee osteoarthritis [(117)](#reference117). In the Framingham Offspring Study (n=672; mean age, 66 years), higher [plasma](../glossary#plasma) concentrations of phylloquinone were associated with a lower risk of hand, but not knee, osteoarthritis [(118)](#reference118). A longitudinal study of 1,180 US adults (mean age, 62 years) found that low plasma concentrations of phylloquinone (0.5 nM) at baseline \u2014 indicative of a [subclinical](../glossary#subclinical) vitamin K deficiency \u2014 were associated with a 56% increase in risk of knee osteoarthritis after 30 months compared to those with higher plasma concentrations [(119)](#reference119). In a more recent longitudinal study among 523 older US adults participating in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study, those with extremely low plasma concentrations of phylloquinone (<0.2 nM) at baseline had increased progression of knee osteoarthritis over three years, assessed by [MRI](../glossary#magnetic-resonance-imaging) of articular cartilage and the meniscus; those with higher plasma concentrations experienced no significant progression of knee osteoarthritis [(120)](#reference120). Moreover, recent studies have associated use of the vitamin K [antagonist](../glossary#antagonist) drugs with higher risks of osteoarthritis [(121)](#reference121) and joint replacement [(121)](#reference121) of the knee and hip compared to nonusers. While these observational data are interesting, [randomized controlled trials](../glossary#randomized-controlled-trial) are needed to determine whether vitamin K [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) in those with low vitamin K status might help prevent or treat osteoarthritis. In an ancillary study of a [double-blind](../glossary#double-blind), controlled trial examining the effects of vitamin K supplementation on bone loss and vascular calcification in older adults, no effects of phylloquinone supplementation (500 g/day) were found on incidence of hand osteoarthritis after three years [(122)](#reference122). Study participants were not screened for vitamin K status, and in a subgroup analysis, those with [serum](../glossary#serum) phylloquinone 1 nM at baseline that reached >1 nM at year 3 had less joint deterioration. These data infer that only those individuals with low vitamin K status benefit from vitamin K supplementation. Unfortunately, no measures were available for knee osteoarthritis, and it is well established that hand and knee osteoarthritis represent different phenotypes. Additional [clinical trials](../glossary#clinical-trial) that specifically examine the effect of vitamin K supplementation on osteoarthritis development are needed, especially in those with inadequate vitamin K status. Sources A US national survey, NHANES 2011-2012, found that average dietary intakes of vitamin K (all forms) vary greatly among individuals, with values ranging from 80 to 195 g/day of phylloquinone for men and 78 to 223 g/day of phylloquinone for women [(123)](#reference123). Mean intakes for both men and women were 117 g/day of phylloquinone; however, 57% of men and 37% of women did not meet the Adequate Intake ( [AI](../glossary#AI)) level [(123)](#reference123). Food sources Vitamin K1 Phylloquinone (vitamin K1) is the major dietary form of vitamin K in most diets. Green leafy vegetables and some plant oils (soybean, canola, olive, and cottonseed) are major contributors of dietary vitamin K. Mixed dishes have also been found to significantly contribute to vitamin K intake in the US [(123)](#reference123). However, phylloquinone [bioavailability](../glossary#bioavailability) from green vegetables is lower than from oil or [supplements](../glossary#supplement). Also, the phylloquinone content of green vegetables depends on their content in chlorophyll (green pigment), so that outer leaves have more phylloquinone than inner leaves. The efficiency of phylloquinone intestinal absorption varies among plant sources and is increased with the addition of a fat source to a meal. Finally, the hydrogenation of vegetable oils may decrease the absorption and biological effect of dietary phylloquinone (reviewed in [2](#reference2), [9](#reference9)). If you wish to check foods for their nutrient content, including phylloquinone, search [USDA's FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/). A number of phylloquinone-rich foods are listed in Table 2, with their content in phylloquinone expressed in micrograms (g). Table 2. Some Food Sources of Phylloquinone | Food || Serving || Phylloquinone (g) | | Kale, frozen, boiled || 1 cup || 493 | | Chard, raw || 1 cup || 299 | | Parsley, raw || \u00bc cup || 246 | | Broccoli, cooked || 1 cup || 220 | | Spinach, raw || 1 cup || 121 | | Watercress, raw || 1 cup || 85 | | Cabbage, green, raw || 1 cup || 68 | | Romaine lettuce, raw || 1 cup || 44 | | Soybean oil || 1 Tablespoon || 26 | | Canola oil || 1 Tablespoon || 10 | | Olive oil || 1 Tablespoon || 8 | | Cottonseed oil || 1 Tablespoon || 3 | Vitamin K2 Menaquinones (vitamin K2) are primarily of microbial origins and thus commonly found in [fermented](../glossary#fermentation) foods, such as cheese, curds, and natto (fermented soybeans) [(124, 125)](#reference124). MK-4 is menaquinone that is not produced by [bacteria](../glossary#bacteria). MK-4 is formed from menadione (a synthetic form of vitamin K) found in animal feeds or is converted in a tissue-specific way from multiple dietary forms of vitamin K, including phylloquinone and various menaquinones [(4](#reference4), [126)](#reference126). Menaquinone-4 is found in dairy products, including milk, and in some meats [(125)](#reference125). Longer chain menaquinones are found in limited fermented food products. The Japanese fermented soybean-based, natto, is rich in MK-7 (998 g/100 g) and also contains MK-8 (84 g/100 g). Some cheeses contain MK-8 and MK-9 [(2](#reference2), [125)](#reference125). Additionally, animal livers Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/), have limited data on menaquinone content in foods. Thus, menaquinone contribution to total vitamin K intakes is difficult to estimate and likely to vary between populations with different food consumption practices [(2](#reference2), [125)](#reference125). Bacteria that normally colonize the large intestine ( [colon](../glossary#colon)) can [synthesize](../glossary#synthesis) menaquinones. It was initially thought that up to 50% of the human vitamin K requirement might be met by bacterial synthesis. However, all forms of vitamin K are absorbed in the small intestine via a mechanism requiring [bile](../glossary#bile) salts, while most of the menaquinone production takes place in the colon where bile salts are lacking. Current research suggests that the contribution of bacterial synthesis to vitamin K [status](../glossary#status) is much less than previously thought, although the exact contribution remains unclear [(16](#reference16), [127)](#reference127). Supplements In the US, both phylloquinone and menaquinones are available without a prescription in multivitamin, single-nutrient, or multiple-nutrient [supplements](../glossary#supplement) in varying doses; vitamin K content of multivitamins typically range from 20 to 120 g per tablet [(128)](#reference128). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not authorized any health claims for any forms of vitamin K. Safety Toxicity Although allergic reactions are possible, there is no known toxicity associated with high doses (dietary or [supplemental](../glossary#supplement)) of the phylloquinone (vitamin K1) or menaquinone (vitamin K2) forms of vitamin K [(47)](#reference47). The same is not true for synthetic menadione (vitamin K3) and its derivatives. Menadione can interfere with the function of [glutathione](../glossary#glutathione), one of the body's natural [antioxidants](../glossary#antioxidant), resulting in [oxidative damage](../glossary#oxidative-damage) to [cell membranes](../glossary#cell-membrane). Menadione given injection has induced liver toxicity, [jaundice](../glossary#jaundice), and [hemolytic anemia](../glossary#hemolytic-anemia) (due to the rupture of red blood cells) in infants; therefore, menadione is no longer used for treatment of vitamin K deficiency [(5)](#reference5). No tolerable upper intake level ( [UL](../glossary#UL)) has been established for vitamin K [(47)](#reference47). Nutrient interactions Large doses of [vitamin A](vitamin-A) and [vitamin E](vitamin-E) have been found to [antagonize](../glossary#antagonist) vitamin K [(8)](#reference8). Excess vitamin A appears to interfere with vitamin K absorption, whereas vitamin E may inhibit vitamin K-dependent carboxylase activity and interfere with the [coagulation](../glossary#coagulation) cascade [(129)](#reference129). One study in adults with normal coagulation status found that [supplementation](../glossary#supplement) with 1,000 IU/day of vitamin E for 12 weeks decreased - [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) of prothrombin, a vitamin K-dependent [protein](../glossary#protein) [(130)](#reference130). Individuals taking [anticoagulatory](../glossary#anticoagulant) drugs like warfarin and those who are vitamin K deficient should not take vitamin E supplements without close medical supervision because of the increased risk of [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) (excessive bleeding) [(131)](#reference131). Drug interactions The [anticoagulant](../glossary#anticoagulant) effect of vitamin K [antagonists](../glossary#antagonist) (e.g., warfarin) may be compromised by very high dietary or [supplemental](../glossary#supplement) vitamin K intake. Moreover, daily phylloquinone supplements of up to 100 g are considered safe for patients taking warfarin, but therapeutic anticoagulant stability may be undermined by daily doses of MK-7 as low as 10 to 20 g [(132)](#reference132). It is generally recommended that individuals using warfarin try to consume the [AI](../glossary#AI) for vitamin K (90-120 g/day) and avoid large fluctuations in vitamin K intake that might interfere with the adjustment of their anticoagulant dose [(9, 10](#reference9), [133)](#reference133). The prescription and anti- [tuberculosis](../glossary#tuberculosis) drugs (e.g., rifampin and isoniazid) to pregnant or breast-feeding women may place the newborn at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of vitamin K deficiency [(134)](#reference134). The drug amiodarone, used in the management of certain cardiac [arrhythmias](../health-disease/arrhythmia) (irregular heartbeat), including [atrial fibrillation](../glossary#atrial-fibrillation), can enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and thus increase the risk of [hemorrhage](../glossary#hemorrhage) [(135, 136)](#reference135). Further, the use of [cholesterol](../glossary#cholesterol)-lowering medications (like cholestyramine and colestipol), as well as orlistat, mineral oil, and the fat substitute, olestra, may interfere with fat absorption and affect the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin K [(137)](#reference137). Linus Pauling Institute Recommendation It is not clear whether the [AI](../glossary#AI) for vitamin K is enough to optimize the - [carboxylation](../glossary#carboxylation) of vitamin K-dependent [proteins](../glossary#protein) in bone (see [Osteoporosis](#osteoporosis-prevention)). To consume the amount of vitamin K associated with a decreased [risk](../glossary#risk) of hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture) in the Framingham Heart Study (about 250 g/day) [(50)](#reference50), an individual would need to eat a little more than \u00bd cup of chopped broccoli or a large salad of mixed greens every day. Though the dietary intake of vitamin K required for optimal function of all vitamin K-dependent proteins is not yet known, the Linus Pauling Institute recommends taking a multivitamin/mineral [supplement](../glossary#supplement) and eating at least one cup of dark-green leafy vegetables daily. Replacing dietary [saturated fats](../glossary#saturated-fatty-acid) like butter and cheese with [monounsaturated fats](../glossary#monounsaturated-fatty-acid) found in olive oil and canola oil will increase dietary vitamin K intake and may decrease the risk of [cardiovascular disease](../glossary#cardiovascular-disease). Older adults (>50 years) Because older adults are at increased [risk](../glossary#risk) of [osteoporosis](../health-disease/osteoporosis) and hip [fracture](../glossary#fracture), the above recommendation for a multivitamin/mineral [supplement](../glossary#supplement) and at least one cup of dark green leafy vegetables daily is especially relevant.
