It is in fact a therapeutic care approach of which plant aromatic essences called essential oils are the basis. Aromatherapy is one of the naturopathy tools-resources and it is used to fight many ailments (stress, muscle and joint pain, digestive problems, headaches, fatigue, etc.). It is important not to confuse the term \"essence\" with essential oil that is obtained by cold distillation of a plant providing it with therapeutic properties. Contrary to what its name would suppose, its extracts are not necessarily oily. Essential oils have multiple properties and are carefully selected and mixed by your Naturopath to meet one's specific needs. They have proven, among other things, to have an antiseptic effect (against bacteria, viruses, fungus and parasites). Essential oils also contribute to mental health and fight anxiety. On top of stimulating senses with their pleasant smells during the massage, these oils penetrate the skin and capillaries, providing benefits through skin absorption. The oils can also be used internally, that is to say in capsules or mixed with food. Essential oils used at the Zeina Raya's Massotherapy and Naturopathy Clinic are pure and obtained through cold distillation in order to retain all their properties. "}
