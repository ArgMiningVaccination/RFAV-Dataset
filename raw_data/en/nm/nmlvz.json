Natural Home Remedies to Clean Your System of Weed If you are lucky and have a few days before the test, you can opt for home remedies to clean your system of weed. These are natural home remedies for drug detox, easy to make at home, and have no side effects. These include basic lifestyle changes and the introduction of some herbs and teas in your diet. What Natural Remedies to Use to Detox Your Body for Marijuana? There are a few methods to follow while body detox: - Stay hydrated - Follow a healthy diet plan - Consume fiber-rich foods - Drink herbal teas - Exercise - Practice meditation and yoga - Reduce stress - Give your body adequate rest - Avoid drug intake Let's discuss each of them individually. Hydration and Water Intake Can you flush weed out of your system with water? The answer is yes, via renal excretion. Our kidneys filter the blood in the renal tubule and secrete it out of the body. An effective natural detox for THC is hydration. The more you drink, the higher the filtration rate of the kidneys. So all you have to do is increase your water intake. Drinking more fruit juices and liquids hydrates the body and helps you expel toxins. Typically, fill your bladder with fluids and water a few hours before going in for the test. Many people prefer to wash out their bodies days before the test. However, never go for the test first thing in the morning. That's when your urine is most concentrated, and a few traces may still be detected. If you're not a heavy smoker, a few days of washing out and other home remedies to pass urine tests will work. But heavy users should take at least a week or two off the drug and water intake before going for the test. Diuretic Foods and Beverages Diuretics increase urine production. They are also helpful in treating edema, high BP, and other kidney issues. Doctors prescribe these to assist the kidneys in active waste filtration out of the body. You can find these diuretics in naturally occurring foods like: - Dandelion roots and leaves - Watermelon - Caffeine - Parsley - Celery - Juniper berries, etc. - Coffee If you've had late-night hangovers, you'd know how coffee can undo it. Coffee can help you get rid of THC in the blood too. Coffee is a popular diuretic and helps the body produce more and more urine. This way, the more your drink, the faster it eliminates alcohol and THC. But make sure you drink plenty of water and other fluids alongside coffee. Else it may lead to dehydration. - Lemon Juice Make your refreshing lemon juice drink and have it 7-8 times a day. It's easy to make. Add half of the lemon juice in about 8 or 16 ounces of water. The drink is healthy and can help you pass your drug test easily. - Cranberry Juice Cranberries are natural THC detox; for the best results, drink cranberry juice with lots and lots of water. You can also take an electrolytic drink to urinate more often and cleanse your system. Drink as much as two liters of cranberry juice daily for the best results. You may add topical fruit or apple cider vinegar to your drink to enhance the results. - Apple Cider Vinegar Apple cider vinegar has several known medical benefits. It controls weight, aids immunity, and helps eliminate toxins from the body. The only thing you need to be careful about, though, is to use pure and quality apple cider vinegar. Just take two tablespoons max a day with lots of water. The great thing about it is that it can also clean up the hair follicles. So if you have THC buildup in your hair, it can help you take the drug hair test and pass it with flying colors too. - Fruit Pectin Pectin is a compound found in fruit like pears and apples. It helps in detoxifying the body. It collects the toxins and releases them out of the body via excretion. Pectin breaks down the compound in metabolites. Hence, with a urine test coming up, it can be your BFF. It starts affecting your metabolism within an hour after taking it. Exercise and Sweating Exercise is very beneficial for the body as it helps increase the metabolic rate. It also releases sweat and urine, which help in excreting out the waste matter and toxins from the body. Another remarkable thing exercise does to the body is that it breaks your fat cells. As they break, the THC remnants are released into the blood. So the kidneys and liver are freed of it. - Sauna Sweating cleanses your body and removes toxins. The sauna doesn't involve much exercise. It has similar effects on the body. As you sweat, the body undergoes exfoliation and cleaning of skin pores, automatically making your skin supple and glowing. Removing THC will take a lot of time if you opt for saunas. The best option is to couple it up with the other home methods. Other exercises that can help break down the fats and help in the elimination of weed leftovers from the body are: - Cardio exercises - Jogging - Cycling - Running - kickboxing - Jumping rope, etc. - Cycling - Indoor cycling - Outdoor cycling - Yoga - Bikram yoga - Hot Yoga - Plyometric exercises - Squats - Medicine ball slams - Box jumps - Lateral jumps, etc. Dietary Adjustments High-fiber foods effectively burn fat cells and help increase metabolic activity. You can easily add these to your diet and get all the health benefits of fiber and grains. Some of the lifestyle changes you can easily try are: - Whole grain bread - Whole grain cereal - Brown rice - Whole wheat pasta You can also get fiber from fruit, nuts, and legumes like beans. - Walnuts - Almonds - Beans - Hazelnuts - Berries: strawberries, blueberries, cranberries, raspberries - Apples - Kale - Red cabbage - Broccoli - Onion - Flax seed - Ginger and garlic - Spinach, etc. It is also important to know, what food is better to avoid while THC detox. If you are going to pass a drug test, don't eat this food: - Poppy seeds: they can cause a [false positive](https://www.vcfsef.org/false-positive-drug-test)result on a drug test due to the presence of opiate compounds derived from the poppy plant that may be detected in urine or blood samples. - Durian: it is not known to cause false positive results on drug tests as it does not contain any substances that are typically screened for in drug tests. - Hemp seeds: these can potentially cause a false positive result on a drug test for marijuana due to the presence of trace amounts of THC, the psychoactive compound found in cannabis, although the likelihood is generally low unless consumed in large quantities. Home Remedies to Clean Your System of Weed - Importance of a Balanced Diet You need to have a balanced diet while you are working on detoxifying your body. Drinking too much water alone for fear of failing the test could be fatal. Moreover, if you are going to pass a drug test tomorrow, drinking too much water can dilute your urine and cause being suspended in tampering. That is why in short-term detox it is important to take supplements like [creatine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34559477/) and [niacin](https://www.vcfsef.org/niacin-to-pass-drugtest) additionally. So, what to eat to get rid of THC? To break down the toxins in your body, you need a combination of antioxidants, minerals, and amino acids \u2014 all these work together to further facilitate the breakdown of fats and toxins. Then you need the proteins, carbs, and healthy fats to meet your body's needs. Without these in the required quantities, you will feel drained, and your body won't be able to function or aid detoxification. Detox Teas and Drinks Detox tea for THC and drinks made from herbs like lemon balm, milk thistle, etc., detoxifies the body. Some easy-to-make, natural detox drinks for THC are: - Lemon and Ginger Detox Drink All you need is a lemon, a piece of ginger (sliced), a few mint leaves, and water. Just mix them and keep them in a pitcher of water. Let the drink settle for about an hour. Drink this instead of water the whole day. - Cucumber and Mint Detox Water Here's another refreshing detox drink you can easily make at home. Just take a cucumber - sliced - and a few mint leaves. Place them in a pitcher and fill it with water. For best results, let it rest overnight and enjoy a cool refreshing detox treatment all day. - Detox Smoothie Take a cup of kale or spinach, an apple (green), cucumber, and lemon. Add in a piece of ginger and coconut water. (Else, use plain water.) Blend all ingredients til you get a smooth paste. Drink this once a day as a snack or meal. Additional Tips for Passing a Drug Test Home Remedies Urine drug testing is the most famous drug test today. It's simple: A urine sample is taken and tested for drugs and metabolites in the lab. Proper urine sample collection If you have an upcoming drug test, here's how to ensure proper urine sample collection to avoid the risk of a retake. - Different tests have different requirements. Make sure you go through the instructions carefully. - Ensure you are adequately hydrated; it works as a natural detox for drug test. But avoid overhydration that may lead to suspicion. - Abstain from taking drugs. - Ensure you always provide a fresh sample. Testers check for the temperature of the sample before accepting it. - Always collect the midstream only. - Provide the sample per the indicated amount. - Beware: A technician may be asked to monitor the sample collection. Avoid Drug Use While Trying Home Remedies to Clean Your System of Weed The only way to pass the drug test is to stop taking the drugs before the test. This is especially in the case where you've been given a substantial window for the testing. If it's random testing, you can only hope for the best and abstain from drug use since your employer goes for the random sample tests. But for other scheduled tests, it's best to stop intake until you appear for the test so you have better chances of having no drug remnants in your system. Stress and Sleep Stress can affect all aspects of our lives. Similarly, if you are attempting to pass the test, stress will only worsen it. Ensure you sleep well and rest, especially the night before the test. Relaxing and getting sleep can help your system perform well, so your chances of doing well on the test are high. Establish and adhere to a bedtime routine. If you enjoy reading or having a warm bath before you sleep, do that and make it a pattern so your body adjusts to it. Also, avoid caffeine intake at night so you can sleep undisturbed through the night. Conclusion THC affects our productivity and ability to perform on the job. It's no wonder why so many employers test their employees for the presence of the drug in their systems. If you're a regular cannabis smoker, things can get stressful. This is why you need extensive detox methods you can try at home to cleanse your system of the drugs. These natural home remedies to clean your system of weed are quite effective, especially over the long run. Plus, they don't have any side effects. You can use them easily at home without worrying about any impact on your body. Importance of Consulting a Healthcare Professional Despite that, it's always best to consult a healthcare professional before detoxing. Here's why: - Safety Concerns: We often do not know about any underlying conditions regarding our health. Healthcare professionals look into these conditions, take a history of your medications and then prescribe a personalized plan for the detox method. They assess its safety, effects, and complications it can have with the other medicines you're taking. - Personal Plan: Since everyone is different, we need a different natural weed detox plan for our unique selves. The medical professionals make personalized plans per your BMI, medical history, and other important factors. - Assessment: The health care professional also assesses your organs, overall health, and nutrition in your diet before reformulating a detox plan. This way, if you have any deficiencies, they can be looked into before you go for detoxification. All in all, these medical practitioners provide support and advice on detox plans. That's why you need to consult and openly discuss your health, drug use, and how to get THC out of your system naturally with them. This way, they can make customized plans for you and recommend the best detox plans for your conditions. "}
