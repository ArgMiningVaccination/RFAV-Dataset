We personally perfer the term Aspergers or Aspie. In her case, it might be genetic. Her paternal grandfather had many classic Aspie traits, and I wonder about some family members on my side who were typical eccentric professors. My sister's daughter has strong aspie characteristics, and my sister's grandson has been diagnosed with autism. Her greatest issues are social, which we work on, and physical - her digestive troubles, the inability to handle heat, the inability to handle pain, and NO painkillers work when she has a headache etc. |At what age did you first realize that something was wrong with your child?| |My dauther has always been different, but I enjoy her so much I didn't ever think anything was wrong. I just assumed she was a little eccentric. She was a lot of fun to raise because her intelligence was so high and her humor so funny. Girls with Autism show different signs than boys. I prefer \"signs\" rather than \"symptoms\" because I don't think autism in and of itself is a disease or disability, instead more of a neurological difference. My almost 18 year old daughter is high functioning, seeming neurotypical until you get to know her well or enter into her world. She is pretty, articulate, intelligent and competent. We have a friend whose son is an Aspie. He is highly intelligent, went off to college at a major tech university and fell apart. He was then diagnosed. My daughter told me multiple times that she is like him, and wanted to be tested. I learned much about Aspie girls from the Aspie Girls website (it is run by the author of Aspie Girls, but I can't remember her name right now). The author had much helpful information that described my daughter perfectly. She provided links to an online test, so we decided to try it. I figured the author, herself an Aspie, was not one to waste her time with frivolous, poorly constructed, incorrect or mediocre tests. I took it and scored neurotypical. My daughter scored half neurotypical and half aspie. It was a spider web test, the answers divided it right down the middle. The assessment described her perfectly, so we take it that she is High Functioning Autism, preferably Aspergers. I am low income and cannot afford very expensive clinical assessments, but I think we're on the right track here.| |What are the major symptoms of your child?| |Social cluelessness, difficulty forming connection with peers can be very blunt very high vocabulary very high intelligence High logic and reasoning skills instead of playing with dolls, she seemed to collect them with a focus on one particular doll ( we might consider it obsessive now, but it was very funny then) low empathy - not absent empathy, as in sociopaths or narcissists, it's definately there, just more Vulcan-like. Separation anxiety, fear of abandonment Different perceptions of temperature - does not handle heat well at all, tends to overheat fast Different pain perceptions - feels pain much stronger than other kids DIGESTIVE TROUBLES difficulty toilet training Fixations, habits and ritual behavior. Some OCD like behavior. Aspergers is very gender specific, too.. A great quirky, ironic sense of humor.| |What treatments do you think worked best for your child?| |I think treatment begins with parenting techniques, especially consistent investiment in one's child. These children do not fare well in our broken and superficial society. I wonder if things might have been a bit easier on them when there were healthier and stronger kinship systems, connectedness, and strong \"scaffolding\" like faith and values. Diet is critical - staying away from destructive additives, healthy eating etc. I kept her off technology for a long time. I am a single mom, I raised her on my own. She sees her dad periodically. He does not know she is an Aspie (her choice). I had a gut feeling not to leave her alone. I am a teacher in a small private school so she basically grew up there in a structured, loving environment. She will live at home and go to college to study School Psychology. I secretly hope she will be an advocate for other young aspies, who are largely misunderstood but it's up to her. I have another friend whose son was classic autistic when little: he banged his head, made no eye contact etc. She kept him off all processed food, no computers at all, outdoors, structure, he is a fine young man. I had no idea he was autistic! For a long time, I thought it was because my daughter was traumatized by the divorce but now I know that while she may have been disturbed by it, the real issue is the way she lives in and perceives the world. My job as a parent is to guide her, provide structure, love her and unlike other kids, provide her with \"translation services\". I have to explain a lot to her about things neurotypicals seem to pick up on naturally, like why you have to make eye contact or show special courtesy to old ladies at church or share your potato chips in certain settings and endless other social issues. I am trying to train her to live independently. Lots of talking and interaction. All in all, having an \"Aspie Girl\" for a daughter has been wonderful. She has fine qualities that are rare: a strong sense of right and wrong, strong personal convictions, I'm thankful for her. I don't know if this is any help. I have worked with autistic and aspie kids for years. The cases seemed to radically spike in 1986. so you might want to find out what happened around that time that caused the increase. It's not more testing. The increase is real. I do not know the rates in 3rd world countries, but I do suspect it might be a first world phenomena. sadly, Chernobyl happened in 1986, it caused many birth defects. Could it account for the dramatic spike of Austim? Who knows, but it's interesting. If I can be of any help, please let me know. My daughter volunteered to talk to anyone to describe her experience.| |Name:| |Lana B., July 20, 2020| |What factors or causes do you think triggered Autism in your child?| | | Part Genetic Part Vaccines |At what age did you first realize that something was wrong with your child?| |At around 18-2 years of age| |What are the major symptoms of your child?| |Stimming Fine motor skill issues Trouble finding words Trouble with expressive speech Obsessive behaviours| |What treatments do you think worked best |Biomedical supplementation ABA 26, 2020| |What factors or causes do you think triggered Autism in your child?| | | She was born through c section, she had craniosynostosis (left coronal suture) plus she took lots of antibiotics and has been vaccinated. |At what age did you first realize that something was wrong with your child?| |14 months| |What are the major symptoms of your child?| |Loss of eye contact, acknowledging us, not wanting to play, fixating on things and loss of speech.| |What treatments do you think worked best for your child?| |Nothing so far.| |Name:| |Jennifer S., June 14, 2020| |What factors or causes do you think triggered Autism in your child?| | | vaccines |At what age did you first realize that something was wrong with your child?| |2 years| |What are the major symptoms of your child?| |candida yeast overgrowth, weakness, problems with communication and social awareness| |What treatments do you think worked best for your child?| |probiotics, yeast killer| |Name:| |Megan F., May 7, 2020| |What factors or causes do you think triggered Autism in your child?| | | Food and vaccines |At what age did you first realize that something was wrong with your child?| |16 months| |What are the major symptoms of |Stimming, nonverbal, trouble sleeping, abnormal bowel movements| |What treatments do you think worked best for your child?| |Change in diet| |Name:| |Mandeep M., January 23, 2020| |What factors or causes do you think triggered Autism in your child?| | | He was born hypoglycemic and was in Nicu for 3 weeks.

All high in preservatives, chemicals, steroids, antibiotics and processed sugars. Fish ( containing mercury) which I craved and at a lot of during my pregnancy. Household cleaners, such as bleach (contains lead) which absorbs into the blood stream on bare skin contact. |At what age did you first realize that something was wrong with your child?| |Two and then slowly disappearing from me completely by the age of three. He never spoke or tried to repeat words. Never any eye contact.| |What are the major symptoms of your child?| |My son is no longer a child, but a young adult. However in his younger years it was outbursts/angry fits. Throwing things, trying to bite us. It grew worse once he hit puberty. Hurting himself, head banging on the floor, biting himself and it was worse because he was extremely strong during these fits. This would last 5 minutes (with much damage while it lasted) and then he would break down crying. He had no control over any of this mind you, as some would like to say. These were not tantrum fits, but neurological issues he couldn't control. He was always remorseful once it passed and would show me by crying and hugging me. I took notes after everything he ate and learned that many of these fits were triggered by foods.| |What treatments do you think worked best for your child?| |Naturalistic- no chemical treatments such as medications-it makes the condition worse, long term. No sugars, dyes or preservatives what so ever. Tests for allergies. Tests for heavy metals in their systems. Mercury, aluminum, lead. My son does not and never has taken medications for his autism. His system is sensitive to many things and there are many things that can trigger his outburst (foods, aresols, perfumes and dyes. My son was not BORN autistic, he slipped into it at around the age of three. Organic (clean foods) have helped him very much. Keeping his bowels moving helps decrease his outbursts and headaches.| |Name:| |Tammy W., January 2, 2020| |What factors or causes do you think triggered Autism in your child?| | | Vaccines |At what age did you first realize that something was wrong with your child?| |12 months old diagnosed at 18 months| |What are the major symptoms of your child?| |GERD severe constipation has a hard time burping and relieving gas stomach cramps nonverbal 5 years old only eats baby food| |What treatments do you think worked best for your child?| |Haven't found one yet| |Name:| |Sherri M., December 15, 2019| |What factors or causes do you think triggered Autism in your child?| | | Shots |At what age did you first realize that something was wrong with your child?| |2.

I noticed this upon delivery & it became more apparent to me at 15 months with a lack of pragmatic language skills, ability to focus on say sucking a bottle as well as cuddling with me, his mom. My son is now 4 yrs. old. Now, I think my son had a traumatic birth via csection. I had an uncomfortable pregnancy and I think he was in distress. He was a swinging baby in my womb. I think he was a bigger baby, 10.5 lbs., and I had an undiagnosed diabetic disorder. I also think there were issues getting him out. I had a bladder bleed and appendectomy months after, as well as abnormal uterine bleeding after my pregnancy. I was sick when pregnant with him and had an undiagnosed yeast infection. I also had some sort of pneumonia and resp. Infections. As he became older, he had many resp. Infections and undiagnosed ear infections from about 3 months on. I was also on the medication, levetiracetum , for seizures, and had a low thyroid treated by generic synthroid when pregnant. |At what age did you first realize that something was wrong with your child?| |See above - the moment I brought him home. More apparent at 15 months.| |What are the major symptoms of your child?| |Hyperactivity and distraction more than ever since working out many sensory issues. Pragmatic language delay and expressive speech delay. He has come along way with services. He does have a lisp and needs processing time. He has issues with self-regulation, slowing down. Sensory wise, he is a head butter & we notice some issues with foods. He has come along way. He can get dressed. Fine and gross motor issues. Hard to write. He is 4 and not potty trained. He has issues with the vestibular and preociperative nervous systems. He has issues with sitting. He has loose stools. He is getting lots of ear issues, but has seen an ENT. Ear tube surgery is optional for him now. He gets lots of infections and usually has to have temporary asthma meds to help him relieve such bad resp. Issues once he gets them.| |What treatments do you think worked best for your child?| |I have not done much. I will go for a neuropsych come Summer. I have utilized the community to socialize him as much as possible. He's in a gymnastics class without an aide and a one on one swim class. He has been in recreational classes with an aide. This has helped immensely. I fought for an IEP for him so, he's in his 2nd year of preschool. He receives speech and occupational therapy at school and privately. These services have helped him. I will continue on doing this. Listening & distraction and lack of self regulation affects him significantly in these environments. I have him pretty much on a schedule. It helps with consistency and maintaining skills. We are working on potty training.| |Name:| |Pamela B., November 28, 2019| |What factors or causes do you think triggered Autism in your child?| | | Genetics MMR was a trigger Pushing for 2.5 hours for a baby that was born sunny side up Lack of education on maternal intake of Vitamin D |At what age did you first realize that something was wrong with your child?| |15-18 months| |What are the major symptoms of your child?| |Currently: Low verbal.

There is definitely a direct relationship with the gut -brain. My son was born premature. I believe that multiple vaccines given at one time may have weakened the immune system, which in turn allowed an overgrowth of bad bacteria. He was very colicky and continues to have significant problems with constipation. His temperment and attention span have improved tremendously on a GFCF diet.

My son has had many encounters with gastroenteritis from the time he was small. Last winter, my child had it a record 4 times...each time was a week long.

Vaccinated multiple times due to requirements for adoption. I believe he may have been in a state of health (imbalanced gut flora) before adoption and that the additional environmental assaults (vaccines, formula, etc.) led to autism.

The symptoms often mimic autism (sensory and OCD issues), so these children are often misdiagnosed. So, as far as I am concerned, while my children do not have autism, I think there probably are children out there misdiagnosed with autism and they likely have PANDAS as a result of an untreated strep infection. The strep antibodies cross the blood brain barrier and attack the basal ganglia causing all of the bizarre symptoms to suddenly present themselves.| |At what age did you first realize that something was wrong with your child?| |With my five year old, it was when he was four. With my seven year old, he has had transient tics throughout his toddler years that were probably PANDAS related, but he had a very noticeable exacerbation about six weeks ago causing a huge decline in social skills, OCD and anxiety (tics as well). He has been on antibiotics for four days, and we have already seen a decline in symptoms.| |What are the major symptoms of your child?| |See above...we also lose fine motor skills when they have been exposed to strep.| |What treatments do you think worked best for your child?| |Antibiotics, probiotics, Nystatin to curb HTP.| |Name:| |Jennifer W.| |What factors or causes do you think triggered Autism in your child?| |His vaccinations. He was a normal, healthy, talking child. At his 1 year check up he was given: DTaP, HAV (hep A), HIB (Haemophilus INfluenzae b), Flu Shot, MMR-VAR, PNUcn (Pneumococcal) all in one day with a large dose of tylenol. Bryan was a wonderful, intelligent, easy baby with no issues except for tummy problems for months after all of his vaccine visits. After his 1 year visit with 6 immunizations, he became very ill with a 105 fever for days and after that lost the light in his eyes, lost a word a week till there were none. He was dx at 23mos. I am a RN, I know what is normal and when children are ill. My son acted as though he was poisoned. SO, I am recovering him with Andrew Cutler Chelation protocol, low and slow method chelation by mouth, along with good probiotics, organic foods, gfcf diet, excellent supplements- water soluable dosed 3-4 times per day and fat dosed once (to half-life). He is getting better.| |At what age did you first realize that something was wrong with your child?| |Hours after his 1 year vaccinations, he became ill. It took weeks of the fevers, lethargy, horrific stools, crying and the doctors telling me it was normal and 'toddler diarrhea'. He lost his soul and speech, one word at a time. He was 24months by the time he had no language. He has is back now.| |What are the major symptoms of your child?| |ead banging, flapping, visual stimms, screaming tantrums, anger, space case, toe walking, grunts no words. Most are gone now since chelation, we are on round 15 with a good yeast protocol, bacteria control and anti-virals too. He no longer stimms. He talks with a delay. Everyday he gets better and better. Usual rounds for recovery (the people I know that have) is 100-300rounds. We have a ways to go. : )| |What treatments do you think worked best for your child?| |Being an RN, getting clinician 1 DAN training, understanding the immune system, recognizing the need for physical illness help more than therapy has helped my child to get better faster than most I am sure. But a safer way as well. I don't use DAN protocol chelation, it is not safe, it is not dosed to the half-life of the chelators which can cause horrible movement and shifting of metals in the body. With AC Chelation, the double thiol chelator of either DMPS, DMSA or ALA (ALA crosses BBB) by mouth only and dosed in a round (every 6 hours for a week for DMPS and a 72hour period for DMSA and ALA dosed every 3 hours) according to the half-life of the chelator. This removes metals safer than the DAN every 8 hours or more protocol and a larger dose than AC. Doses for chelation ranges about 1/8mg to 1mg per lb, when DAN doses can be 150mg per dose! Scary. I am seeing wonderful gains from my son. I feel strongly he will recover. By recover, I mean no need for gfcf, no supplements except normal vitamins, probiotics, no therapy, no special ed. I know it can happen. I was told my son would never speak or care who I was. This morning he ran into my room, jumped on the bed and said, \"wake up mommy! I pee pee in the bed!\" LOL. He also says \"I love you!\" Bryan is 4 years old on 11/27. He is happy and getting better everyday. This will be a long haul but totally worth it.

Although he never has had antibiotics (though I was for 10 days with a bout of mastitis when he was a month old - so I guess he could have gotten some through my milk), was not a c-section baby and was breast fed until 18months, he did have constant sinus colds, along with major diarrhea alternating with constipation. He would get sandy stools, mucus in his diapers etc. Something was clearly not right.| |At what age did you first realize that something was wrong with your child?| |Prior to age 1 I noticed \"startles\" which were later diagnosed as myoclonic seizures. I noticed behavioral oddities around 1yr of age - didn't play with toys correctly, dragged his fingers on the walls, wouldn't sit to read a story etc; but the loss of eye contact, increased self stimulatory behavior (hand flapping, sensory seeking etc), drunken gait, and the eventual \"drugged out absent look\" was very obvious by 16-17 months.| |What are the major symptoms of your child?| |First, he has myoclonic seizures. He also \"pushed\" furniture around (probably trying to get pressure on his belly), had sour, foul, acrid diarrhea alternating with constipation, lack of playing appropriately with toys, was non verbal - not even babbling - just high pitched squealing, he lost eye contact and sociability, had no interest in stories or sitting in laps, he was constantly moving. The only time he sat still was in high chair or car seat. He is still like that but to a lesser degree.| |What treatments do you think worked best for your child?| |I didn't notice what a problem dairy was until I put him on the GF/CF diet and months later tried to re-introduce it. We got all of that diarrhea, sandy stools, mucus etc immediately and went from some babbling back to no sounds except for squealing and he started flapping his hands and stimming more. | Kirkman's acidophilus powder even at 1/4tsp/day made him have a severe herxheimer reaction - so we assumed yeast, but he didn't tolerate the product well at all. We give him Syntol now which is a probiotic/yeast cleanse and he does well on it and doesn't have any die off reaction, but stool tests show that he still has NO GROWTH of good bacteria (lactobaccillus, bifidum etc) on culture as well as presence of harmful bacteria and his urine test has yeast metabolites so we know he has yeast. He also had a stool test when he was 18 months old, but was on the Kirkman probiotics at the time. The levels of good bacteria were 1+ so I am assuming without the probiotics it would have been more similar to this latest test. I don't have a solution yet - I am hoping D-free will help. I do not understand why he has such low counts of good bacteria!! I am interested in seeing what he might be like when his bacteria are better. He declines dramatically when we take him of the Syntol even for a couple of days, so there has to be some connection between his behavior and his gut. |Name:| |Suzi M.| |What factors or causes do you think triggered Autism in your child?| |Severe and chronic diarrhoea for the first 12 months of life.| |At what age did you first realize that something was wrong with your child?| |At birth it was completely obvious he was unwell physically.

I saw immediate and dramatic responses in both my ASD children. Both got extremely ill every time, and their personality and happiness and involvement started to disappear, they got rancid diarrhea and bloody stools and butts.My son even went comatose for about an hour with a fever of 104. My youngest child is my only nuerotypical child.I didn\\'t know anything about vaccines or autism at the time I had her. She was born as we were moving from Maine to texas. She was born in a military hospital and they tend to be a little more laid back, and leave the burden of responsibility to the patient. When my daughter was born we had to close on our house the next day, so we checked out of the hospital early promising to get her shots the following day. She didn\\'t get that first day Hep B shot. The Navy clinic ended up not being able to see her for three weeks. I think both of those circumstances saved my youngest child from being autistic. Just that little bit of a waiting period. I also had no vaccinations when I was pregnant with her, but I did the other two. My NT child has the same gut issues as my older children. She also has PANDAS and major yeast overgrowth and many food sensitivities. I believe if I would have had injections while pregnant, and she had her first day immunizations that she would be autistic as well. She\\'s not. She is a social butterfly in gifted classes. Vaccines took my older children\\'s lives and happiness away from them, and I\\'m going to get them back:)| |At what age did you first realize that something was wrong with your child?| |I was a very young mother. I had my first child when I was 19.It was 1995. I knew nothing about autism, and didn\\'t for many years. I thought it was funny that my daughter never crawled, she rolled everywhere. When she finally did walk she was a toe walker until she turned 11, and still does it on occasion. She started having violent temper tantrums when she was 9 months old. We say that\\'s when her horns came out:) I just thought it was normal, I\\'d heard of the terrible twos...I just thought she was advanced:)When she was three she became extremely violent and destructive and withdrawn. This coincided with ehr father being deployed for the first time. I have bipolar disorder and I thought she did too. She had rage, she seemed to get depressed and withdrawn. So she was diagnosed as bipolar at three. My son was different from the get go. He was born in 1998, the year they introduced the first day Hep B shot. He screamed and cried and yanked his legs constantly. He had bloody stools and butt. He got pneumonia at three weeks old. He had eczema all over his body and face. He\\'d constantly get bizarre rashes and he was constantly ill. He was also terrified of everything. I literally carried him everywhere...washing dishes, vacuuming, even in the shower if my husband wasn\\'t there to pull him off me. He woke up terrified all the time. He projectile vomited all the time. He would scream in terror as he entered the preschool years and we tried to take him to school. We thought he was bipolar too. So he was diagnosed at age three as bipolar| |What are the major symptoms of your child?| |Both are high functioning...if you can call it that. They speak, they attend school. My son was able to stop wearing pull ups to bed when he turned 11 years old. My daughter has low muscle tone, dysgraphia, learning disabilities, no concept of social situations, poor motor coordination, OCD on occasion...maybe PANDAS. She has 18 food sensitivities. She has clostridium overgrowth, very high oxalic acid, 4+ gamma hemolytic strep, 4+ Alpha Hemolytic strep and a billion other gut, inflammation, immune and viral issues.She has bifocals and a \\\"lazy eye\\\", and can\\'t hear out of her left ear.I could go on and on. My son had such severe and constant bowel pain that he was diagnosed with ulcers. He had asthma and allergies so badly that he was on 5 allergy meds, a nebulizer, and two inhalers and still wasn\\'t well. When we started GFCF it all went away!! No allergies, no asthma, no exczema and no stomach pain!!! He has major anxiety that is lessened with medication. He still throws up often and has poo issues:) He also has the strep that my daughter has, also major yeast overgrowth, high oxalic acid, high coproporphyrins. He has extreme behavior issues at home and school. He has a severe stutter. He has no concept of social situations, but is aware that he\\'s different.| |What treatments do you think worked best for your child?| |GCFC IS AWESOME!!! That was our first turning point. That\\'s when they started to feel better and get better. Then I learned more, we tested more and tried more things.We are now GFCF soy free, yeast free, and low sugar...everything organic.They also take Cod liver oil, probiotics, colostrum, multivitamin, milk thistle and digestive enzymes. So far doing a yeast detox diet along with diflucan has given us the most major changes. Both children are more aware of themselves and their surroundings. They\\'re calmer and rarely have anger issues. They\\'re both doing far better acedemically. We\\'re still new to biomedical treatments so that\\'s all the answers I have for now. They both need B vitamins, but neither can tolerate them. They both need methyl b-12 shots, but can\\'t tolerate them.| |Name:| |Jamie| |What factors or causes do you think triggered Autism in your child?| |antibotics due to ear infections which lowered his immune system and hurt his gut.

While a premature baby, the hospital gave him his first hepatitus shot even after I instructed them I would rather wait until his weight improved. He was only 3 pds, 12 oz.

Child received extended course of antibiotics at 2 months and did OK until stopping probiotics, then had blood in stool.

She asked, \"Did he bump his head?\" She sent me to a neurologist. Nick then had an MRI of the brain, CAT of the brain, eeg, overnight stay sleep study, and a variety of brain tests. All findings were negative as I expected. I told her he showed signs of autism after his shots. She then stated, \"Let's not blame it on the shots.\" Prior to the shots, I told her I was very concerned about the vaccine/autism epidemic. She stated, \"look at him Kim. He's not autistic he is developing normally, making eye contact, and talking. He is clearly NOT autistic.
