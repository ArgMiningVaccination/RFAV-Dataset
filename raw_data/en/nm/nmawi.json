Eliza from [Earth Mama Aromatherapy](https://www.earthmamaaromatherapy.com) is a dear friend of mine. She creates handmade products with pure essential oils with a special focus on motherhood and parenting. She recently interviewed me for her blog, we spoke about wellness tips for the cooler months, rural living and music. Eliza has kindly let me share the interview on my new blog! I have learnt to love playing at weddings, but at the start I found them incredibly stressful. This was probably my biggest challenge at the beginning. I found I put a lot of pressure on myself to have everything perfect because its someones big day! I've definitely fallen in love with this type of gig now though. I enjoy being a part of the frame work of a wedding day, I've got to make friends with some other incredible suppliers and venue staff and I've learnt the flow of a wedding day, so I definitely love the atmosphere of a wedding. You have recently relocated from Adelaide to the small town of Streaky Bay, where you grew up. What are you loving most about living back at 'home'? It's been such a blessing to have a few solid months at home in Streaky Bay. I was hesitant at first as I've somehow hardwired myself to live a fast paced lifestyle. The last 4 years I've either studied or worked as a musician 6-7 days each week, hence this has been a necessary slow down, I was dancing on the boarder of burnout! One of my favourite things about living in Streaky Bay is the jetty pool, I've been trying to swim every other day, even when it's cold. The fresh air and close proximity to the sea is something I quickly take for granted so I have to remind myself how precious this untouched coastline is. I'm also loving spending quality time with friends, we've had a lot of fabulous cups of tea and dinner parties making clay creations and reminiscing. I understand that you use essential oils, both in your home and your clinic. Tell me more about when/how you use them, and what impact they have on your well-being. I adore using lavender before bed, I sleep so well each night I have it diffusing in my bedroom. We learnt a lot about volatile oils and their therapeutic uses in a class about the pharmacology and pharmacognosy of herbs. I find essential oils very interesting especially their effects on mood and cognition, I used rosemary oil on my wrists before most exams (that's probably how I managed to memorise the Latin names of each herb). I use tea tree oil frequently in clinic for skin creams that have antiseptic and antibacterial requirements. Finally, where can my readers learn more about you and your offerings? I have a brand new [website](https://alicehaddynaturopath.com) launching very soon, but until then you can find me on Our retail space is located at 40 Wells Street and we are open 12-1pm Monday to Thursday or by appointment. Pop in for an organic chocolate treat and a chat. "}
