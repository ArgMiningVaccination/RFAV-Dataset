Both the Higher Education Policy Commission and the Community and Technical College System are required by state code to report on system-wide progress toward achieving state postsecondary education objectives. This report continues to build from the foundation set by the 2008 Report Card, reporting the most recently available information, as well as regional and national comparisons when they are available. The report is divided into three major sections: The first is an overarching state section that addresses outcomes that apply to all of postsecondary education, not just the individual sectors of the Higher Education Policy Commission or the Community and Technical College System. This section demonstrates the state's progress in student academic preparation for and enrollment in college, all postsecondary degrees awarded, and the financial aid available to assist students in paying for college. The second section of the Report Card is specific to the Higher Education Policy Commission and its constituent baccalaureate-granting (and above) institutions. The indicators in this section are based on the goals set forth in Charting the Future 2007-2012, a Master Plan for Higher Education . The indicators in this report card are divided into focal areas consistent with the master plan: economic growth, access, cost and affordability, learning and accountability and innovation. Report Card 2013 will be the last document in the series to address goals from Charting the Future , as the Commission implements its new five-year master plan Leading the Way: Access. Success. Impact. The third section of the Report Card reflects the progress of the Community and Technical College System of West Virginia toward meeting the goals set forth in the system's master plan entitled Meeting the Challenge: 2010-2015 . The CTCS section of the Report Card highlights specific imperatives set forth by the master plan. Areas of emphasis include a focus on student success, degree completion, and work- force development efforts. Both the two- and four-year systems continue to focus efforts on improving student success and increasing degree completion. Helping students reach graduation, at any degree level, is a critical component in the state's future success. By 2018, half of the state's workforce will require a postsecondary degree. This means that postsecondary education institutions will need to provide 20,000 additional degree holders than they did in 2008. Supporting students who are currently enrolled will provide the bulk of degrees needed to meet the state goal. Innovation at both the system and institutional level such as improving developmental education, initiating degree pathways, increasing distance education offerings, and developing academic and technical programs in new and expanding economic sectors all contribute to the success effort. The positive outcomes associated with postsecondary degree completion are both personal and societal. Degree completion not only helps to meet state workforce needs, but also benefits graduates and the West Virginia communities they call home. On-time degree completion results in less student debt and reduced institutional and state subsidies for continued enrollment. Graduates go on to support their local communities through buying local goods and services, purchasing homes, and volunteering in local schools, charities, and faith-based organizations. Both the two- and four-year system Chancellors continue to emphasize the critical importance of helping West Virginians complete their degrees to create new opportunities for those individuals, their communities, and the state. INTRODUCTION 2|West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission and Community and Technical College System of West Virginia College-Going Rates of Recent West Virginia High School Graduates Fall 2008 - 2012 WEST VIRGINIA HIGHLIGHTS The overall college-going rate decreased 1.5 percentage points from 57.9 percent to 56.4 percent between 2011 and 2012. The in-state college-going rate also decreased, from 50.2 to 48.4 percent between 2011 and 2012. The overall college-going rate has decreased 2.4 percentage points since 2008. The in-state college-going rate has decreased by 1.7 percentage points. NATIONAL CONTEXT Nationally, 64.6 percent of 2009-10 high school graduates continued directly to college the following fall. This was the highest college- going rate on record and is an increase of 8.3 percent over the fall 2000 college-going rate (SREB, 2013). For fall 2010, ten of the sixteen SREB states had a college-going rate that was above the national average. A recent College Summit report addressed the importance of providing data on postsecondary performance to policy makers and educational leaders at the K-12 level. Providing these stakeholders with information about whether recent high school graduates go to college and are successful if they do can help increase the preparation and college-going of high school students (College Summit, 2011). The ability to provide this information in West Virginia has been strengthened by the creation of a State Longitudinal Data System that can follow students from K-12 into college and the workforce. ABOUT THIS MEASURE: This measure provides the proportion of students who graduated from a West Virginia high school in the past year and enrolled in postsecondary education the following fall. Estimates of enrollment in out-of-state higher education institutions are based on surveys of West Virginia high schools. Current data limitations prevent Commission staff from examining these students at the individual level; however, an agreement with the National Student Clearinghouse will give West Virginia the capability to more accurately determine this out-of-state figure in the future.STATE Year In-State VIRGINIA REPORT CARD 2013 | 3 5 5 5 5 4 WETZELHANCOCK BROOKE OHIO Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission and Community and Technical College System of West Virginia Number of Awards: HEAPS, PROMISE, and WVHEG Programs Academic Years 2008 - 2012 WEST VIRGINIA HIGHLIGHTS The total number of Higher Education Adult Part-Time Student (HEAPS) Grant, Providing Real Opportunities for Maximizing In-State Student Excellence (PROMISE) Scholarship, and West Virginia Higher Education Grant (WVHEG) Program awards during the 2012 academic year was 33,411 which is 2.8 percent lower than the total of 34,363 in 2011. Participation in PROMISE increased 1.4 percent, an increase of 137 students, in 2012 when compared to 2011. Both the HEAPS Grant Program and WVHEG saw declines from 2011 to 2012, 18.1 and 1 percent, respectively. When compared with their 2008 student levels, participation in the HEAPS Program declined by 27.3 percent, increased by 7.5 percent in the PROMISE Scholarship Program, and increased by 19.9 percent in the WVHEG Program. The WVHEG Program also had the largest student increase (3,204). NATIONAL CONTEXT Fifty states and territories reported having need-based grant programs in 2011-12. Exclusively need-based aid constituted 47 percent of all aid granted to undergraduate students. West Virginia ranked 8th among the 52 states and territories in regards to the average grant dollars spent per full-time undergraduate enrolled student, with an average award size of $1,043 per student. The median state expenditure was $650 (NASSGAP, 2013). Nationally, 93.1 percent of need-based grant dollars went to in-state students in 2011-12, with 70.8 percent of grant dollars being spent in the public sector and 22.4 percent being spent in the private, not-for-profit sector. In West Virginia, 83.8 percent of those need-based grant dollars went to West Virginians, with 75 percent going to students in the public sector. These numbers represent a 0.4 percent decrease in need-based grant dollars going to West Virginians, and no change from the previous year in need-based aid in the public sector. ABOUT THIS MEASURE These figures represent the number of awards made through one of three state financial aid programs: the HEAPS, PROMISE, and WVHEG. These data are presented by year and by programmatic totals. Student headcount is unduplicated unless the student was awarded in two different semesters at two different types of schools or the student received two different kinds of award.

The WVHEG Program experienced a 3.6 percent increase ($1,430,575) in awards from 2011 to 2012, while both the HEAPS and PROMISE Scholarship Programs declined 14.5 and 0.9 percent, respectively. Between 2008 and 2012 awards increased for the PROMISE and WVHEG Programs. The WVHEG has experienced the largest percentage (15.6 percent) and monetary increase ($5,511,781). NATIONAL CONTEXT Nationally, just under $11.1 billion in total state-funded student financial aid was awarded during the 2011-12 academic year. This figure represents about a 3.2 percent increase in nominal (non-inflation adjusted) dollars over the previous academic year. The majority of state aid is scholarship and grant aid, representing $9.4 billion or 84.7 percent of the total. Of this $9.4 billion in grant aid, 74 percent was need-based while 26 percent was non-need-based. These figures represent a 3.1 percent increase in the proportion of need-based aid from the previous year. Between 2001-02 and 2011-12, need based grant aid grew by 42.9 percent, from $4.9 billion to $7 billion in constant 2011 dollars, while non-need based grants grew 59 percent from $1.5 billion to $2.4 billion. (NASSGAP, 2013) The SREB states collectively awarded approximately $4.6 billion in aid in 2011-12, a decrease of 7.5 percent over the previous year. Scholarships and grants represented 84 percent or $3.8 billion. Of this total, $1.7 billion, or 37.7 percent, was scholarships and grants based on need whereas $2.1 billion, or 46.3 percent, was not based on need. These figures show a decrease of 6.5 percent in the proportion of aid that is based on need over the previous year. ABOUT THIS MEASURE These figures represent the amount of state financial aid awarded through theHEAPS, PROMISE, and WVHEG. These data are presented by year and by programmatic totals.

Over the ten-year period, the total number of degrees and credentials has increased by 28.9 percent from the 2003 level of 13,141. The largest increase in proportion of degrees over this ten-year period was in undergraduate certificates with an increase of 436.6 percent. The largest increase in number of awards was in baccalaureate degrees with a rise of 1,630. Associate's degrees and certificates were 25.4 percent of the total in 2012, with bachelor's degrees making up 53.7 percent and advanced degrees 20.9 percent of total awards. NATIONAL CONTEXT Across the SREB states, the number of awards conferred at four-year public colleges and universities was 569,731 for the 2010-11 academic year. The total number of awards conferred at two-year public institutions was 282,991. The proportion of awards that were associate's degrees and certificates was 44.4 percent; bachelor's degrees made up 38.7 percent and advanced degrees were 16.9 percent. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the total number of awards conferred by West Virginia public institutions: undergraduate certificate, associate's, bachelor's, master's, post-master's certificate, and doctoral degree-research/scholarship. Most certificates and associate's degrees, however, are awarded within the Community and Technical College System. Each award conferred represents mastery of a set of skills or body of knowledge that is valuable in the West Virginia labor market. Degrees and certificates conferred represent the system's human capital contribution to moving the West Virginia economy forward. Furthermore, the proportion of the populace with higher education credentials is an important criterion in recruiting private industry to locate in the state.

STATE WEST VIRGINIA HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY COMMISSION WEST VIRGINIA REPORT CARD 201 3 | 7 ECONOMIC GROWTH Total Science and Engineering Research and Development Expenditures Fiscal Years 2007 - 2011 WEST VIRGINIA HIGHLIGHTS Total science and engineering related research and development (R&D) expenditures at West Virginia colleges and universities grew by 8.2 percent, from $194,834,000 in Fiscal Year 2010 to $210,889,000 in 2011. Total science and engineering related R&D expenditures have grown over the five-year time period examined here by 26.1 percent from their Fiscal Year 2007 level of $167,208,000. NATIONAL CONTEXT Universities and colleges in the United States reported science and engineering related R&D expenditures of $65.1 billion in Fiscal Year 2011, which represents an increase of 6.4 percent over the previous year ($61.2 billion). Adjusted for inflation, academic R&D rose by 3.3 percent in 2011. According to the National Science Foundation, from Fiscal Year 2007 to 2011 total research and development expenditures at academic institutions grew by 26.1 percent from $51.6 billion to $65.1 billion. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the total amount of revenues expended at West Virginia colleges and universities on science and engineering related research and development regardless of revenue source. It includes spending at private institutions, but it should be noted that private institutions represent a small proportion of expenditures in the state. Thus, it includes government (all levels), institution, and private industry support of basic and applied research. University spending on R&D in science and engineering is a good indicator of the total volume of research being produced in postsecondary education to support discovery, opportunity, economic growth, and diversification. $200,000 $150,000$100,000 $50,000 $167,208$170,869$174,486 10 11 070 8 0 9Total Science and Engineering Research and Development Expenditures YearTotal Expenditures 2007 $167,208,000 2008 $170,869,000 2009 $174,486,000 2010 $194,834,000 2011 $210,889,000 Source: National Science Foundation 8|West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission and Community and Technical College System of West Virginia Federally-Funded Science and Engineering Research and Development Expenditures Fiscal Years 2007 - 2011 WEST VIRGINIA HIGHLIGHTS The total amount of federally-funded science and engineering related research and development (R&D) expenditures at West Virginia colleges and universities in fiscal year 2011 was $114,245,000 which was 4.1 percent higher than the figure of $109,732,000 in 2010. Over the five-year time period, the amount of federally funded R&D has increased by 23.4 percent from its 2007 level of $92,586,000. NATIONAL CONTEXT Federal funding of science and engineering related research and development in U.S. colleges and universities rose by 8.8 percent from $37.5 billion in Fiscal Year 2010 to $40.8 billion in 2011. Adjusted for inflation, this represents a 5.6 percent increase from 2010. The overall level of federally- fundeed research and development expenditures in the United States has grown by 34 percent from $30.4 billion in Fiscal Year 2007. The federal government has been the largest source of R&D expenditures at colleges and universities since 1972, but its share has declined slightly in recent years. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the amount of science and engineering related research and development expenditures at all West Virginia colleges and universities, including private institutions, which come from grants and contracts from the federal government. Many of these grants and contracts are competitive and provide a good indicator of both the quality and quantity of research being performed in the system. Obtaining federal funds bolsters the revenue streams available for research and development and demonstrates the increased national competitiveness of the state's institutions in this highly competitive environment.

NATIONAL CONTEXT Colleges and universities reported total research and development expenditures (which include other fields in addition to science and engineering) of $61.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2010. This figure was 28.2 percent higher than the Fiscal Year 2006 total of $47.8 billion. While these national data include institutional spending in addition to outside contracts, they provide an indicator of growth in total research effort. Public universities and colleges reported total research and development expenditures of $41.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2010 which was 19.9 percent higher than $32.4 billion in 2006. Although there has been long term growth over 5 years, it should be noted that short term decreases are expected to continue nationally as federal stimulus money begins to dwindle. ABOUT THIS MEASURE These funds include any externally-sponsored research activities, grants, or contracts procured by college and university faculty and staff to produce, or advance, new knowledge in any field. It includes all funds from the federal government, non-profit agencies, and private industry that are channeled through university research corporations or offices. It is an important indicator of the extent to which the system is leveraging outside dollars to complement state spending on research that increases West Virginia's capacity to attract new business and industry.Research Grants and Contracts YearFunds For Externally- Sponsored Research 2008 2009 $243,433,000 2010 $208,881,286 2011 $146,006,451 2012 $148,960,202 *The 2010 and 2011 totals do not include figures for Glenville State College.Degrees/Credentials Awarded by Level Award Type 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2011-2012 2008-2012 % Change% Change Certificate 772 .. the category \"First-Professional\" with\" Doctoral Degree-Professional Practice\".10 |West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission and Community and Technical College System of West Virginia Degrees/Credentials Awarded by Level System-Wide Academic Years 2008 - 2012 WEST VIRGINIA HIGHLIGHTS The total number of degrees and credentials awarded at West Virginia colleges and universities in academic year 2012-13 was 12,927 which was 0.6 percent lower than the 2010-11 figure of 13,008. Over the five-year time period, the number of degrees and credentials has increased by 7.3 percent from the 2008-09 level of 12,047. The largest one-year increase in the number of awards was in baccalaureate degrees with a growth of 465 which occurred between 2010-11 and 2011-12. NATIONAL CONTEXT Across the SREB states, in the decade from 2001-02 to 2010-11, the number of awards conferred at four-year public colleges and universities grew by 37.1 percent from 415,444 to 569,731. The 2010-11 total also represents a 5 percent increase over the 2009-10 total of 542,567. The proportion of these degrees that were bachelor's degrees decreased slightly from 69.8 percent to 69 percent, but the proportion that were associate's degrees and certificates increased from 1.8 percent in 2009-10 to 2.4 percent in 2010-11. The proportion of advanced degrees increased from 28.4 percent to 28.7 percent (SREB, 2013). In the country as a whole, the total number of degrees conferred at public institutions increased by 5.6 percent from 2,090,192 in 2009-10 to 2,206,273 in 2010-11. Over the last ten years, the number of degrees conferred at public institutions increased by 26.3 percent nationally (Digest of Education Statistics, 2012). ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the total number of awards conferred by West Virginia and associate's degrees, however, are awarded within the Community and Technical College System.

Over the five-year time period, STEM awards as a percentage of all awards decreased 0.6 percentage points from the 2008 level of 21.8 percent. The pipeline of STEM graduates has grown. The number of students majoring in STEM fields has grown by 9.8 percent from 10,636 in 2008 to 11,679 in 2012. NATIONAL CONTEXT Over the most recent available five-year window from 2004-05 to 2008-09, the number of science and engineering degrees awarded in the United States increased by 8.1 percent from 603,278 to 652,208. The proportion of overall degrees that were in science and engineering, however, decreased by 1.3 percentage points from 42.6 percent in 2004-05 to 41.3 percent in 2008-09. During this time period, the proportion of bachelor's degrees (32.3% to 31.3%) and master's degrees (21.0% to 19.8%) decreased while the proportion of doctorates (62.4% to 67.3%) that were in science and engineering increased (NSF, 2010). ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the proportion of graduates each year in STEM fields at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels.

National scores declined by 0.2 points during the same period. West Virginia scores on math and science tests have remained steady since 2009. West Virginia students' average score is higher than the national average in English and reading, but trails in math, science and the composite score. NATIONAL CONTEXT Approximately 1.8 million students in the high school graduating class of 2013 took the ACT exam. This figure represents an 8 percent increase from the previous year. The ACT exam is administered in all 50 states. West Virginia was one of 26 states where over 60 percent of high school graduates took the examination in 2012; however, the national percentage of graduates tested was 54 percent, which increased from 52 percent in 2011. ABOUT THIS MEASURE The ACT exam is accepted for admission at all public four-year institutions in the state and focuses on student readiness for postsecondary education. Having more students take the exam allows policymakers to effectively gauge student readiness. The fact that a greater proportion of West Virginia high school seniors has taken the exam in recent years while scores remained steady is an indication of increasing preparation and college readiness.

For-credit enrollment has increased 3.3 percent since 2008 representing a growth in actual students of 1,803. Since the 2008-09 academic year, seven four-year institutions have realized gains in undergraduate enrollment while four have experienced decreases. NATIONAL CONTEXT Between 2007 and 2011, the most recent year of national enrollment data available, the number of students enrolled in four-year public institutions in the United States rose from just under 7 million to 7.4 million, an increase of 6.1 percent. In the SREB states, enrollment rose by 7.8 percent over that same time period. The increase in West Virginia over the same time period was 4.3 percent (SREB, 2013). In 2011, 36.2 percent of total postsecondary enrollment was made up by students at four-year public institutions nationally. This figure was 40.3 percent for SREB states and 60 percent in West Virginia. ABOUT THIS MEASURE Undergraduate headcount enrollment represents the number of students who have paid fees and enrolled in classes according to fall, end-of-term data. This indicator includes students who might be simultaneously enrolled at more than one institution as well as high school students who are dually enrolled. Increasing enrollments are more likely when high school graduation pools are expanding; however, with projected declines in these figures due to state demographic shifts, postsecondary institutions will need to diversify their enrollment base of students in order to maintain current enrollment levels.

For-credit enrollment has decreased 1.4 percent since 2007, representing a decrease in actual students of 182. Since the 2008-09 academic year, five four-year institutions have realized gains in graduate enrollment, while three, Fairmont State University, Marshall University, and West Virginia University have decreased. NATIONAL CONTEXT Fall 2011 national data are the most recent available regarding graduate and first-professional student enrollment. During Fall 2011, approximately 2.8 million graduate students were enrolled at Title IV institutions in the United States. Graduate enrollment grew nationally by 18.2 percent over the last ten years and by 29.6 percent in the SREB states. Nationally, 51 percent of graduate student enrollment was located in public colleges in 2011 compared to 65.9 percent in SREB states and 87.5 percent in West Virginia (SREB, 2013). ABOUT THIS MEASURE Graduate and first-professional headcount enrollment represents the number of students who have paid fees and enrolled in classes according to fall, end-of-term data. The list of graduate programs totals 157 and includes first professional, master's, post-master's and doctoral programs. These programs are spread throughout West Virginia postsecondary institutions with the majority located at West Virginia University and Marshall University. The first- professional programs include dentistry, law, medicine, osteopathic medicine, and pharmacy.

FTE enrollment has increased 3.7 percent (1,832 students) since 2008, representing a growth. Since the 2008-09 academic year, eight four-year institutions have realized gains in FTE enrollment, while three have experienced decreases. NATIONAL CONTEXT FTE enrollment is often used at the national level to determine a host of outcomes including expenses by academic or administrative function per FTE, and revenues per FTE. Student credit hours are consolidated into the equivalent number of students taking a full load to allow institutions and systems to plan strategically for future growth. ABOUT THIS MEASURE Undergraduate FTE is student credit hours minus the sum of all hours generated by all students enrolled in a class, divided by 15. Fifteen hours is considered to be a full-time load for undergraduate students. FTE enrollment was calculated from fall, end-of-term data.

First-time freshman enrollment has increased 1.5 percent since 2008 representing a growth in actual students of 175. Since the 2008-09 academic year, six four-year institutions have realized gains in first-time freshman enrollment while five have experienced decreases. NATIONAL CONTEXT Between 2002 and 2011, first-time freshman enrollment in the nation increased 20.3 percent. The four-year public sector realized an increase of 28.2 during this same time period. Nationally, full-time students comprised 78.9 percent of first- time freshman enrollment in 2002 compared to 80.2 percent in 2011 (NCES, 2013). During that time in West Virginia, the percentage of first-time freshmen that were full-time decreased from 90.1 percent to 70.4 percent. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This first-time freshman enrollment from fall, end-of-term data consists of the entering freshmen who have never attended college. It also includes those students enrolled in the fall term who attended for the first time in the prior summer term. This measure also incorporates students who enter with advanced standing (college credits earned before graduation from high school).

Adult student enrollment has increased by 612 students since 2008 representing a growth of 3.3 percent. Since 2008, eight institutions have realized gains in adult student enrollment while four have declined. NATIONAL CONTEXT According to the Lumina Foundation, 38.3 percent of Americans between the ages of 25 to 64 had some college credential in 2010, a slight increase over the previous year's 38.1 percent. By 2018, it is expected that 60 percent of all jobs in the United States and 48 percent in West Virginia will require some level of postsecondary education. To reach 60 percent, at least 103 million Americans aged 25 to 64 must receive a college credential. A recent initiative by the federal government has a growing number of states adopting adult college degree attainment goals in order to prepare for the coming increase. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This fall, end-of-term adult enrollment data provide the number of students aged 25 and older enrolled in classes in West Virginia's four-year institutions. Given the fact that only 26.1 percent of adults in West Virginia have a postsecondary degree, which is last among the fifty states, as well as the reality that the pool of high school graduates is declining, it is important that the system find ways to bring adults without degrees into the system and assist this segment of the population in persisting to degree.

Over this five-year span, dual enrollment numbers were at their highest in 2011 before declining to their lowest point in 2012. NATIONAL CONTEXT A 2013 report from the United States Department of Education found that during the 2010-11 school year, 82 percent of U.S. high schools enrolled students in one or more dual enrollment courses.1.4 million students enrolled in a dual enrollment course with an academic focus, while 601,500 students enrolled in courses with a career or vocational focus. Fourteen percent of high schools reported that students earned a certificate at a post-secondary institution, while 7 percent reported that students earned an associate's degree. Requirements for enrollment, structure of programs, and funding schemes varied widely across dual enrollment programs. According to Karp (2012), dual enrollment students learn the curricular and co-curricular skills needed for college success. Dual enrollment students contribute to increased high school graduation rates and are more likely to enroll in a postsecondary institution than their non-dual enrollment peers. In addition, participation in dual enrollment courses in high school was found to improve college GPA's, improve retention into the sophomore year, and had a positive effect on credits earned. ABOUT THIS MEASURE These figures represent the number of secondary students who have enrolled in dual enrollment courses associated with four-year public postsecondary institutions in West Virginia. Dual enrollment courses allow high school students to enroll in college courses and earn college credit. These courses were once largely limited to high-achieving students, but are now open to a wider range of students as states have begun to view dual enrollment as a means to support postsecondary preparation. Counts include some students who enrolled at multiple institutions and are from fall, end-of-term data.

From 2008 to 2012, students transitioning laterally have declined by 8.9 percent. Students transferring from two-year to four-year public postsecondary institutions increased a 0.8 percent from 2011 to 2012. This category of students has increased 39.5 percent when compared to the 2008 transfer number. NATIONAL CONTEXT Multi-institutional attendance has become an increasingly common phenomenon. In the 2011 National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE), over 40% of seniors surveyed had transferred from other institutions (2011, p.13). Transfer students also spent more time with work commitments, almost twice as much weekly as students who had not transferred. Senior transfer students reported an average of 15 hours working off campus compared to the institutional natives who reported 8 hours per week (NSSE, Figure 4). Transfer patterns have been found to be related to student success. A 2009 NSSE report indicated that forward and lateral transfer students were less engaged and satisfied with their college experience than native students. Formal institutional transfer, such as transferring to pursue a degree program, fosters success, but less discriminate institution- hopping thwarts degree completion. Those students making a traditional transfer from a two-year to a four-year college were 21 percent more likely to complete a bachelor's degree than non-transfer students and those who transferred from one four-year institution to another were 15 percent more likely to complete their degree (Adelman, 2006). ABOUT THIS MEASURE These data indicate the number of students in West Virginia between the years of 2006 and 2010 who either transferred from a public two-year to a public four-year institution (forward transfer) or who transferred from a public four-year institution to another public four-year institution (lateral transfer). The transfer data reported above include some students who enrolled in more than one institution.

The five-year trend in tuition and fees shows an increase of 29.9 percent for in-state students and 23.5 percent for out-of-state students. The ten-year trend in tuition and fees is an increase of 70 percent for in-state students and 59.9 percent for out- of-state students though the increase in dollars was larger for out-of-state students. In-state tuition has increased by $2,399 since 2004 and out-of-state tuition has increased by $5,172. NATIONAL CONTEXT According to SREB data, over the ten-year period from 2002-03 to 2011-12, median in-state tuition at four-year public colleges and universities in SREB states increased from $3,253 to $6,532, an increase of 100.8 percent. If these figures are adjusted for inflation, the figure is 60.6 percent. In the country as a whole during the same time period, median in-state tuition increased from $3,728 to $6,951. This was an 86.5 percent increase without adjusting for inflation, a 49.1 percent increase with inflation adjustment. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the average published price of tuition and mandatory fees for in-state as well as out-of-state students across the system. It does not include the costs of books or room and board and is not an enrollment weighted average. It also does not include the financial aid, both state and institutional, that reduces the cost of attendance for many students.

Adjusting for inflation with the Consumer Price Index, these changes represent a 2.6 percent increase at Potomac State and WVU Institute of Technology, and a 7.4 percent increase at Fairmont State University. Over the five-year period from 2009 to 2013, the percent increases varied from a low of 12.5 percent ($644) at WVU Institute of Technology to a high of 30.6 percent ($1,496) at Glenville State College. Adjusted for inflation, these increases were 3.1 percent and 19.8 percent respectively. Ten-year increases varied from a 53.4 percent increase of $2,022 at WVU Institute of Technology to a 94.9 percent increase of $3,108 at Glenville State College. These increases are reduced to 23.9 percent and 57.4 percent when adjusted for inflation.

NATIONAL CONTEXT As can be seen from the chart at right, tuition at West Virginia public institutions is lower than the average tuition at peer institutions for almost all Commission institutions. Similarly, if the tuition among the 20 peer institutions is ranked from highest to lowest, all West Virginia institutions, except Potomac State College of WVU, rank in the bottom third. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the published price of tuition and mandatory fees for in-state students at each institution. This does not include the costs of books or room and board. It also does not include the financial aid, both state and institutional, that reduces the cost of attendance for many students. Tuition and fees for in-state students at public four-year colleges are, on average, higher than public two-year colleges but lower than private four-year colleges and universities or public four-year universities at the out-of-state rate.Undergraduate Tuition and Fees (In-State) Peer Comparison, 2013 Tuition and FeesPeer Group Rank Average Bluefield State College $5,564 $6,921 17 Concord University $6,002 $7,151 15 Fairmont $5,824 $6,844 15 College $6,384 $7,947 18 Marshall $7,622 18 Potomac State of WVU $3,336 $3,367 9 Shepherd University $6,256 $7,118 14 West Liberty University $6,226 $7,361 12 West Virginia State University $5,932 $6,965 16 West Virginia University $6,456 $9,731 19 WVU Institute of Technology $5,808 $7,951 16 28 |West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission and Community and Technical College System of West Virginia Cost of Attendance for In-State Undergraduate Students Living On Campus 2009 2013 2009-2013 Tuition Average Room Tuition Average Room % Change in Institution & Fees & Board Total& Fees& Board TotalTotal Cost Bluefield State College housing.Cost Of Attendance For In-State Undergraduate Students Living On Campus Academic Years 2009 & 2013 WEST VIRGINIA HIGHLIGHTS The smallest percentage increase for cost of attendance between 2009 and 2013 is found at Fairmont State University where the total rose from $11,349 in 2009 to $13,137 in 2013. The largest percentage increase, excluding Bluefield State College which has no campus housing, is found at Glenville State College. The cost of attendance was $11,138 in 2008 compared to $14,659 in 2013. The four-year public postsecondary institution with the lowest cost of attendance in 2013 is Potomac State College of WVU (again excluding Bluefield State College). The institution with the highest cost is West Virginia University. NATIONAL CONTEXT It is estimated that nationally in 2013-14, tuition and fees comprise approximately 48 percent of the combined expense of tuition and fees plus room and board for in-state students attending a four-year public university. Average total charges of in-state tuition, fees, room, and board at four-year public institutions nationally are $18,391 in 2013-14 which is 3.2 percent higher than the prior year's total (College Board, 2013). ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the amount necessary to pay for tuition and mandatory fees, as well as average room and board, at each institution. Room and board costs vary, however, by where one chooses to live. In general, living off-campus with parents is less expensive than on-campus housing, while living off-campus on one's own is more expensive. These figures do not include books, transportation, and other expenses which were estimated nationally to be $4,435 for 2013-14 (College Board, 2013). COST & AFFORDABILITY WEST VIRGINIA REPORT CARD 2013 | 29 Average Undergraduate Loan Debt Of Bachelor's Degree Graduates Academic Years 2008- 2012 WEST VIRGINIA HIGHLIGHTS Average loan debt for bachelor's degree earners increased 5.2 percent, from $34,047 in 2011 to $35,819 in 2012. The five-year trend in loan debt shows an increase of 24.9 percent from the $28,679 figure in 2008. The only four-year public institution with a one-year decrease in student loan debt is Bluefield State College which realized an 11.1 percent decrease. Potomac State College of WVU's average debt levels should be viewed with caution as the institution has a very small number of bachelor's degree graduates. The largest one-year increase of debt was at WVU Institute of Technology at 14.2 percent. All four-year public institutions have seen an increase in debt over the course of the five-year period, with the largest being at Glenville State College (50.1%). NATIONAL CONTEXT Approximately 55 percent of public four-year college students graduated with debt each year between 2002-03 and 2011-12. During this time period, the average debt of borrowers increased by 19.6 percent after adjusting for inflation from $20,900 to $25,000 (College Board, 2013). While there has been a shift over the last decade in the ratio of loans to grants in total financial aid funds, from 2002-03 to 2012-13, total grant aid per undergraduate FTE grew at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars while total loans increased 3.1 percent per year (College Board, 2013). This has resulted in an increase of total loans used to finance postsecondary education expenses between 2002-03 and 2012-13 from approximately $65.2 billion to $110.3 billion (College Board, 2013). ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the average loan debt that West Virginia public institution undergraduate students have accumulated at any public institution during pursuit of their bachelor's degrees. This debt includes all loans, including the Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students, whether through the government or from private lenders. Average loan debt is calculated only from students who have loans.

The college-going rate of low-income students has decreased 1.5 percentage points from the 2010 figure of 27.4 percent. NATIONAL CONTEXT In the nation as a whole, the proportion of low-income students who enroll in college has increased over the last decade. In 2002, 24.4 percent were enrolled. By 2011 the enrollment of low-income students had increased to 39.4 percent. Among the SREB states, the 2011 college participation rate of low-income students ranges from a high of 44.4 percent in Maryland to a low of 22.7 percent in Oklahoma. West Virginia ranks 14th in college participation of low-income students among the 16 SREB states and is 7.3 percentage points below the SREB average. ABOUT THIS INDICATOR This indicator provides the proportion of low-income students from a state who go on to college. This is measured by dividing the number of students from a state who are attending college with a Pell Grant by the number of 4th to 9th graders who were approved for free or reduced price school lunches nine years before. This method underestimates the number of low-income students in both college and grade school as not all needy students apply for Pell Grants or free and reduced lunch.

The largest gain over the five-year period was at West Liberty University, with an increase of 2.5 percentage points. Nine of eleven four-year public institutions experienced decreases in their retention rates with the largest of 8.2 percentage points at WVU Institute of Technology. NATIONAL CONTEXT The national proportion of fall 2009 first-time freshmen at four-year public institutions who were retained at their home institution the following fall was 76.9 percent. This measurement differs from the West Virginia calculation in that the national figure does not capture students who transferred within their state system and were retained in another school in the state's public postsecondary sector (NCHEMS, 2009). In the SREB region, the one-year persistence rate for the 2010 cohort of full-time, first-time bachelor's degree-seeking freshmen at public four-year institutions was 85 percent. West Virginia is currently ranked last among the 16 SREB states in overall first-year persistence with a rate of 76 percent for 2010 (SREB, 2013). ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the proportion of all first-time freshmen that are enrolled the following year at any West Virginia public college or university. Data capabilities at this point do not allow tracking of students who transfer to private or out-of-state public institutions and complete their degrees there. Students are more likely to drop out during their first college year than at any other time. The ability to provide support that will assist with retention during this first year will increase the likelihood of higher graduation rates.

The largest gain was at West Liberty University, with an increase of 5.5 percentage points. The largest decrease was at West Virginia State University, with a decline of 7 percentage points. NATIONAL CONTEXT The national proportion of fall 2004 first-time, full-time bachelor's degree-seeking undergraduates at public institutions who graduated within six years was 58.3 percent. The figure was higher for women than for men in public institutions (60.6 % for women, 55.5% for men) and private not-for-profit institutions (67.3% for women and 63 % for men) (NCES, 2012). In the SREB region, for the 2004 cohort, the proportion of first-time, full-time bachelor's degree- seeking students who completed their degree at the institution of initial enrollment was 53 percent. Graduation rates have been shown nationally to vary widely by race/ethnicity with 61.5 percent of White students, 50.1 percent of Hispanic students, 39.5 percent of Black students, 39.4 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native students, and 68.7 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander students completing a bachelor's degree within six years. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the proportion of first-time freshmen who are full-time students seeking a bachelor's degree that complete that degree within six years at any West Virginia public college or university.

Degrees conferred have increased by 7.3 percent overall since 2008. The largest one-year percentage gain in number of graduates is found in Security and Protective Services with a 35.4 percent increase (a growth of 76 students). The largest numerical gain is found in Health Professions and Clinical Sciences with an increase of 175 graduates representing a 23.1 percent increase. The largest five-year percentage gain in number of graduates is found in Foreign Languages, Literatures, and Linguistics with a 45.7 percent increase (a growth of 37 students). The largest numerical gain is found in Health Professions and Clinical Sciences with an increase of 375 graduates (an increase of 23.1%). NATIONAL CONTEXT Between 2005-06 and 2010-11, in SREB states and in the nation as a whole, the number of bachelor's degrees conferred at both public and private institutions increased by the largest percent for health professions and related sciences (U.S. 53.7%, SREB 45.2%), followed by science and technologies (15.4%, 19.8%), social and behavioral sciences (13.2 %, 14.4%), business and management (12.3%, 13.1%), and humanities (5.5%, 12.7%). Over this time period, degrees in education decreased nationally by 3.8 percent and increased in the SREB region by 5.9 percent. The magnitude of master's degree growth by field is similar to bachelor's degrees with the largest growth in health professions and related sciences (U.S. 44.2%, SREB 45.4%), humanities (29.3%, 49.9%) and business and 35.9%), followed by science and technologies (23.6%, 26.1%), social and behavioral sciences (21.4%, 23.8%), and education (5.8%, 13%).

Dietetics, Medical Terminology, Nursing, and Praxis II experienced a decrease while Cytotechnology saw no change. 2012 licensure pass rates increased in three areas when compared to 2008 -Dental Hygiene, Nursing, and Social Work (State). Medical Terminology and Praxis II were the only programs to experience a decrease. NATIONAL CONTEXT West Virginia institutions equaled or exceeded the 2011 national pass rates in professions where current comparison data was available: Dietetics, Social Work, and Nursing. National pass rates for the other areas were not available. The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education's latest edition of its biennial state report card entitled Measuring Up 2008 reports that West Virginia is more than 61 percentage points above the national benchmark on professional licensure examinations, making it one of the top five performing states. About 55 percent more of the state's graduates take these examinations than graduates nationwide and West Virginia graduates' pass rates match the national average. Measuring Up 2008 also reports that West Virginia is almost 20 percentage points above the national benchmark in pass rates on teacher licensure examinations. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the pass rate according to the individual test standards of students finishing bachelor's degree programs who sat for some type of licensure examination.

WEST VIRGINIA REPORT CARD 2013 | 37 Average Nine-Month Salary Of Full-Time Instructional Faculty By Rank Fall 2008 - 2012 WEST VIRGINIA HIGHLIGHTS Overall, faculty salaries increased 1.6 percent between 2011 and 2012. Salary gains since 2007 were 5.9 percent. The largest one-year and five-year percentage increases by faculty rank were for graduate assistants and others who realized a 9.9 percent increase from 2011 to 2012 and 51.6 percent from 2008 to 2012. Over the five-year period, the smallest increase was for instructors who realized, on average, a 3.8 percent increase in salary. From 2011 to 2012, on average, instructors' salaries decreased by 2.2 percent. NATIONAL CONTEXT Nationally, the average salary of full-time faculty in 2011-12 was $108,718 for full professors, $77,747 for associate professors, $66,001 for assistant professors and $46,309 for instructors which combined for an overall average salary of $79,511. In the SREB region, the average salary of full-time faculty in 2011-12 was slightly lower than the nation as a whole at $105,376 for full professors, $74,914 for associate professors, $63,694 for assistant professors, and $45,322 for instructors. The SREB had an overall average faculty salary of $75,046. West Virginia ranks 14th among the 16 SREB states in faculty salary, which represents no movement in rank from the previous year. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the average salary for West Virginia's baccalaureate and graduate full-time faculty from fall 2007 to fall 2010. The data do not include medical school faculty. It is important that faculty salaries be competitive with other institutions in order to attract and retain quality faculty. While this indicator provides only salaries of full- time faculty, there have been larger increases nationally in the number of part-time faculty than full-time faculty over the last decade (NCES, 2008).Average Nine-Month Salary of Full-Time Instructional Faculty by Rank, Fall 2008-2012 Rank 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2011-2012 |West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission and Community and Technical College System of West Virginia 10 11 080 11 080 9 1 2 LEARNING & ACCOUNTABILITY WEST VIRGINIA REPORT CARD 2013 | 39 INNOVATION The West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission's master plan for higher education, Charting the Future 2007- 2012, envisions innovation as the key to reaching the goals set forth in the other sections of the plan: access, cost and affordability, learning and accountability, and economic growth. It states, \"Innovation in all these areas is necessary to accommodate changing population demographics, address the pressures of globalization, maximize use of existing resources and infrastructure, utilize new technologies, and communicate more effectively with our constituents.\" Thus, while the outcomes of innovation will be seen in the indicators already presented in this Report Card, this section sets forth some of the many innovative initiatives underway this year to move the West Virginia higher education system toward the goals Charting the Future establishes. ECONOMIC GROWTH The Commission helps to stimulate economic growth in West Virginia through a variety of research initiatives to encourage and generate new knowledge and potentially develop intellectual properties that can be patented, licensed, and commercialized. An increasing emphasis on technology transfer, the movement of intellectual property into economic products and job creation, advances the Commission's role in academic research at system institutions and beyond. The West Virginia Research Challenge Fund provides the foundation for many of the competitive research grant programs administered by the Commission. The fund generates approximately $3 million annually from lottery proceeds as a permanent source of continuing resources for West Virginia science and technology. All projects are supported as \"seed programs that challenge faculty to develop long-term research activities or support based on the initial state award.\" Awards supported by the fund include: oResearch Challenge Grants (RCG), which support large STEM research projects that can lead to research centers and economic development. Projects assist the institution in its ability to successfully compete for external funding on a national and international basis by providing incentives to increase research capacity. All projects must be self-supporting at the end of a five-year performance period and are non-renewable. The RCG awarded to Dr. Xingbo Liu for the West Virginia Center for Electrochemical Energy Storage (CEES) is developing and characterizing key components of low-temperature Na-battery, as well as carrying out multi-scale modeling for such a system. During the first year of the grant, the team has submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office one formal and one provisional patent application. Also, they are working with the WVU Technology Transfer office on the creation of a spin-off company based on CEES technologies. This battery technology has the potential to store energy produced by wind and solar and release it when needed in a much more efficient manner. Dr. David Lederman is the principal investigator of the RCG awarded for A Center for Energy Efficient Electronics (CEEE) at West Virginia University and Marshall University. A Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) proposal to NSF was submitted in June 2013 by Lederman in collaboration with Neocera, LLC (Beltsville, MD) for development of an x-ray fluorescence system that performs structure and stoichiometry analysis using electron beams during thin film sample growth. This is based on a patent submitted by Lederman in 2012. STTR is a program that expands funding opportunities in the federal innovation research and development arena. Central to the program is expansion of the public/private sector partnership to include the joint venture opportunities for small businesses and nonprofit research institutions. oInnovation Grants fund improvements in scientific equipment, curriculum, minor renovations, classroom instruction, delivery, and pedagogy. The program targets innovative, cohesive and/or comprehensive projects in laboratory/classroom settings that encourage undergraduate students to continue careers in science, mathematics, and engineering. oA number of other grants and programs have been implemented to encourage students to major in STEM fields and to provide support for faculty and businesses engaged in research and development. The West Virginia Research Trust Fund allows the state's two research universities, West Virginia University and Marshall University, to double private gifts that support expansion of research faculty and infrastructure in key areas linked to economic development, health care, and job growth. This $50 million \"Bucks for Brains\" fund 40 |West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission and Community and Technical College System of West Virginia supports research in energy and environmental sciences; nanotechnology and materials science; biological, biotechnological, and biomedical sciences; transportation technology and logistics; biometrics, security, sensing, and related identification technologies; and gerontology. Private gifts are matched dollar-for-dollar and all funds are permanently endowed. The state's other public colleges and universities also have the opportunity to benefit from the fund through competitive grants made possible by interest earned on the trust account. oIn 2012, WVU completed raising $35 million that was matched by the Trust Fund. oThe Research Trust Fund program has spawned fifteen endowments at Marshall University to fund allowed research-related activity. These endowments span research areas from Engineering to Clinical and Translational Research and specify uses from direct research support to student research stipends. During FY 2013, the full $15 million in gifts and pledges was raised. Earnings up to June 30, 2013 are $430,000 on $9.7 million of private gifts and pledges received, and $715,000 on the $15 million of state match received. The West Virginia Regional Technology Park in South Charleston was acquired by the Commission in 2010 from Union Carbide Corporation, a subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company. Under leadership of the Commission and guidance from a new board of directors, the goal of the Park is to move ideas made in the academic research setting to the marketplace. The Tech Park's vision is to become a multi-tenant research, development, and commercialization park focused on energy, chemicals, and related technologies for the advancement of education and economic development in West Virginia and the surrounding region. The West Virginia Regional Technology Park is making great progress in this objective. Bridgemont Community and Technical College and Kanawha Valley Community and Technical College will combine to form BridgeValley Community and Technical College. The newly constructed Advanced Technology Center will open in January 2014 as a component of the community and technical college. West Virginia State University is again looking to expand its presence at the park, and it will be adding another research scientist in 2014. These entities will work well with the potential for private and governmental opportunities available following the selection of Rusty Kruzelock, Ph.D. as the new CEO and Executive Director, who began on November 1, 2013. Dr. Kruzelock's background and experience include such entities as NASA, the Department of Defense, and numerous private companies representing biosciences, nanotechnology, and advanced manufacturing. The newest tenant, W.R. Grace, a worldwide chemical technology and research corporation, has expanded their catalyst group and will occupy a portion of Building 2000 as well as a portion of the PPRD plant, located on site. ACCESS The Commission is in the final year of its six-year Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) federal grant. This program is designed to better prepare students for college through intensive academic preparation services, professional development activities for educators, and college information and awareness initiatives for students and parents. Through the grant, the Commission provides college-readiness services to ten high-need counties throughout the central and southern part of the state. West Virginia GEAR UP has provided additional educational opportunities to approximately 13,000 students and their teachers, parents, and family members. The program has coordinated several college awareness projects designed to encourage a sustainable college-going culture within some of the most critical areas of the state. The program has collaborated with dozens of educa- tional and community organizations to promote academic success and social wellness, designed a comprehensive mentoring program that can be implemented in a variety of settings, designed and launched a co-curricular student leadership program focused on building a college-going culture in the grant's service schools, and partnered with the state's institutions of higher learning to showcase the diverse opportunities West Virginia's postsecondary education systems provide. Since the launch of the College Foundation of West Virginia's comprehensive college access web portal (cfwv.com) in October 2009, more than 168,000 individuals have created an account on the web site, and more than 65,000 college applications have been submitted through the portal. Additionally, upwards of 1,300 educators and education stakeholders have been trained to use cfwv.com in classroom and co-curricular activities. The site has served as a launch pad for additional outreach initiatives, including a focus on recruiting adult learners and INNOVATION WEST VIRGINIA REPORT CARD 2013 | 41 an effort to increase awareness regarding state and federal financial aid programs. Early results indicate that these efforts are effective. More than eleven percent of all cfwv.com account holders are adult students or potential adult students, and attendance at College Goal Sunday, a statewide financial aid awareness event coordinated by the Commission, has increased by nearly 400 percent since the event was first held in 2010. In 2011, through its College Foundation of West Virginia initiative, the Commission launched West Virginia's first statewide College Application and Exploration Week program. Now in its fourth year, the program has expanded to include elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, and adult learner sites. College Application and Exploration Week 2013 was scheduled for October 14-18, and more than 150 schools hosted college application and awareness events during the week. In 2012, approximately 4,400 students applied to postsecondary programs during the weeklong event, and more than 25,000 students participated in college readiness and awareness activities. The event was recognized by a statewide proclamation from Governor Tomblin. West Virginia's College Day Program is designed to assist high school seniors and juniors with the college admissions application process. On an annual basis, the agency partners with the West Virginia Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers to develop a statewide travel recruitment schedule. Included in the eight-week schedule are programs that connect college recruiters with prospective students at all public high schools in the state. On-site visits to high schools are the norm; however, large regional college fairs are sponsored in Charleston, Clarksburg, Huntington, Morgantown, Shepherdstown and Wheeling. Staff members from the Commission attend each fair to provide information about the cfwv.com web portal and state-level financial aid programs. In August 2013, the Commission partnered with the West Virginia Department of Education to host the third statewide Student Success Summit, a P-20 collaborative event focusing on supporting student development from pre-school through postsecondary education and the workforce. The Summit sought to align curricular, cultural, and social expectations among all education stakeholders to better prepare students to succeed not only at their current level, but also at the next. Approximately 475 education professionals and community representatives attended the Summit, which offered intensive professional development and collaborative sessions on topics such as high school dropout prevention; college access; providing support for adult learners; college retention and completion; cognitive, emotional and social development; and community and parent engagement. The Commission and the Department of Education have committed to hosting the Summit each year. In August 2013, the Commission was awarded a three-year grant from the Kresge Foundation to begin offering college counseling via text-message. The project is based on behavioral research indicating that students, particularly low-income, first-generation students, require frequent, timely \"nudging\" to complete key college tasks such as applying for financial aid, completing the enrollment process, and completing logistical tasks associated with transitioning to life on campus. The Commission, along with 14 partner high schools and four partner colleges, will pilot the project beginning in January of 2014. Students opting to receive the messages will receive periodic updates reminding them to complete crucial college tasks, and these students will be able to request additional assistance or counseling by responding to the text messages they receive. The Commission will continue to provide the intervention through students' freshman year of college in the hopes of advancing not only college access but also supporting college completion. The Commission and Council continue to focus on the issue of college readiness for success in higher education. As a result of collaboration with the West Virginia Department of Education, beginning in Fall 2012, a 12th grade Transition Mathematics course and an English 12 CR (College Ready) course were offered statewide to high school seniors who were found to need extra review and instruction to be \"college ready.\" Additionally, higher education has been working with the West Virginia Department of Education staff to collaboratively define \"college readiness.\" As part of DegreeNow, a Lumina Foundation funded statewide adult learner initiative, which seeks to reenroll adults with some college credit but no degree, the Commission and the Council have partnered with NASPA- Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education and the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL) to enhance adult-focused student and academic services. Through the NASPA train-the-trainers program, a series of regional workshops led by train-the-trainer graduates, and CAEL workshops and webinars, over 300 higher education professionals across the state have been trained on adult learning theories, best practices for serving adult learners, prior learning assessment, and a variety of other adult learner-friendly processes and practices. NASPA also 42 |West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission and Community and Technical College System of West Virginia created a guide entitled \"Building a Culture of Evidence in Student Affairs: A Guide for Leaders and Practitioners\" for West Virginia student affairs professionals and is currently working on another guide with a focus on serving adult learners. A statewide marketing campaign targeting adult learners continues to reach out to the approxi- mately 200,000 adults in the state with some college and no degree. The DegreeNow quarterly newsletter for faculty, staff, and administrators across the state has provided a forum for sharing adult learner success stories and best practices for serving adult students. Commission staff have presented the activities of DegreeNow at national conferences and adult learner convenings, and the initiative has been featured in the NASPA national magazine, Leadership Exchange. The Commission promotes and supports initiatives that target adults and enhance their ability to attain a bachelor's degree. The RBA Today Program focused on identifying and contacting students with college experience but no degree. Marketing efforts have been designed to encourage adult students to consider the Regents Bachelor of Arts (RBA) program. Institutions have been encouraged to reach out to these adult students. Grants to fund marketing efforts have been provided. Accelerated online courses were offered specifically for RBA students. For the second year in a row, the 2012-2013 academic year saw the RBA programs produce more than 1,000 graduates. The Commission continues to support a major initiative to enhance the ability of adults to attain a bachelor's degree through a new enhancement to the RBA Today program - West Virginia Remote Online Collaborative Knowledge System (WVROCKS). While the RBA has been successfully offered for adults for over 30 years, WVROCKS will provide adults with previous college experience a greater opportunity to complete a bachelor's degree in an accelerated, flexible, online format. Students from all public institutions offering the RBA degree are able to register for courses listed on the WVROCKS portal through their home institution. The Veterans Initiatives Task Force works to promote and facilitate the success of veteran students in West Virginia institutions of higher education, focusing on recruitment, retention, and graduation. Outcomes related to these areas are supported by Task Force and Commission efforts such as: osymposia for institutional staff and faculty; otraining oannual meetings/workshops for school certifying officials; oestablishing policies and procedures that assist veterans in the transition from combat to classroom; oconducting research and data collection; oassisting the Legislature with information about veteran's education and training issues. COST AND AFFORDABILITY The Commission conducts financial aid nights and Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) workshops to increase the number of students applying for financial aid. Also, the Division of Financial Aid has developed a financial aid event kit to help high school counselors better promote these workshops. Currently, work is underway to coordinate these events with colleges throughout the state by standardizing the presentation that is given, making it easier for high school guidance counselors to request a workshop, and posting these workshops to CFWV's website. Over the course of 2013, the Commission scaled statewide a new initiative to publish the number of FAFSA's filed by each high school in order to create more awareness of the number of high school students who are filing. As of August 2, 2013, 56 percent of high school seniors had filed the FAFSA and the Division of Financial Aid is targeting the counties with the lowest FAFSA filing rates for additional outreach activities. Training continues to be an area of emphasis as the Commission offers regional workshops to help train college financial aid staff on state financial aid policies. At this time, several different training opportunities are available. Such opportunities include training for the Financial Aid Management System, federal financial aid training for new financial aid professionals, and the development of written policies and procedures manuals for schools to use in processing state aid. Division of Financial Aid staff also conducted state aid reviews to ensure accountability of institutions in processing state aid. The FAFSA has recently been simplified by the federal government and now only takes an average of 23 minutes to complete. Because of this, the application for the workforce component of the Higher Education Adult Part-Time Student (HEAPS) grant now requires a completed FAFSA and has been moved online in order to improve program integrity and ensure students meet the eligibility requirements. INNOVATION WEST VIRGINIA REPORT CARD 2013 | 43 LEARNING AND ACCOUNTABLITY West Virginia is part of the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC), a group of over 20 states working collaboratively to develop assessments aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for K-12. The Common Core State Standards were developed voluntarily and cooperatively by 48 states, two territories, and the District of Columbia by K-12 educators and college faculty to define the knowledge and skills students need to succeed in college and the workplace. In West Virginia, nearly 100 teachers across the state customized these standards to benefit West Virginia students and their needs. These are being called the Next Generation Content Standards and Objectives. A primary goal of the Smarter Balanced system is the commitment by higher education institutions to recognize an agreed-upon uniform performance level on the 11th grade assessment as evidence that students are ready for entry-level, credit-bearing courses in English and mathematics and should be exempted from developmental coursework. Nationwide higher education faculty and K-12 teachers are involved with the creation of the computer adaptive assessment. With this in mind, the Commission created a statewide Higher Education Smarter Balanced Advisory Council to assist in the dissemination of Smarter Balanced information and goals to the campuses across West Virginia. The Advisory Council objectives include the following: (1) generating higher education support, (2) strengthening and expanding partnerships between higher education and K-12 in this arena, (3) providing expertise, advice, and feed- back to the Commission, the Community and Technical College System (CTCS), and the national SBAC in the development, implementation, and promotion of SBA, and (4) taking SBA information back to campuses and to various higher education advisory groups/councils. Work is also being done to provide professional development for teacher education and content area faculty around the CCSS and the Smarter Balanced Assessment. The Commission requires its constituent colleges and universities to annually provide updates on their institutional compacts, indicating progress toward meeting the goals of the state master plan. The compacts, with annual updates and revisions, are the basis for the assessment of success in carrying out institutional mission and in attain ment of institutional and state goals. Through the compacts, institutions report on a number of required and elective elements including enrollment, graduation rate, retention rate, assessment of student learning, and use of instructional technology. Each year, the submitted Compacts are reviewed by a team of experts and staff. Feedback is given to each institution, based upon the assessment of each compact with subsequent approval of the Compacts by the Commission. Compact updates for 2013 were submitted in November and are the last to be submitted under Charting the Future . Through a program review process mandated by West Virginia code and guided by Commission policy, institutions annually review academic programs and assess them for viability, adequacy, necessity, and consistency with mission. Programs are reviewed on a five-year cycle. Summary reports are shared with the Commission. These reports show that institutions are enhancing the reviews through the use of external reviewers, a practice stressed in Commission policy. In addition, the summary reports reveal that institutions are being diligent in using assessment results for program improvement. The Commission continues to use the program review process as a means of monitoring compliance with a Commission policy statement that the commonly accepted program length is 120 hours for a bachelor's degree program. Follow-up reports are requested from programs that exceed this standard. As part of a $1 million grant from Complete College America, the Commission has been focusing efforts on redesigning developmental education delivery to improve outcomes for the population of students entering institutions with these needs. In October 2012, the Commission gathered representatives from all institutions to share system data on the outcomes of developmental education students and to learn about reforms in this arena going on around the country. Moving forward, the Commission will provide resources for faculty training and curriculum development to campuses as they work to adopt best practices in this area critical to student success. In an effort to improve student advising, retention, and degree completion, the Commission, Council and WVNET have partnered to provide institutions with the technology to implement a web-based academic advising system that is linked with the campus BANNER system. This technology, DegreeWorks, provides degree audit capabilities to help students and their advisors better negotiate the academic requirements for the student's program of study and will serve as the basis for an additional statewide transfer and articulation applications. 44 |West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission and Community and Technical College System of West Virginia The Commission has undertaken an initiative to improve the quality of online classes offered by West Virginia higher education institutions. In January 2012, West Virginia entered into a statewide agreement with Quality Matters (QM). Quality Matters is a nationally recognized peer review process for online courses. Since implementation, 520 faculty and instructional technology staff members have been trained on the Applying the Rubric course; 58 faculty have been trained as peer reviewers; and two faculty have been trained as master reviewers. All courses submitted for consideration on the Southern Regional Education Campus for the fall 2013 semester are reviewed and must meet Quality Matters standards. The West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission administers a portion of Title II, Part A funds to make competitive subgrants to eligible partnerships comprised of at least one institution of higher education and their college/university school of arts and sciences and a high-need local educational agency. The Improving Teacher Quality State Grants Program partnerships use the funds to conduct professional development activities in core academic subject areas in order to ensure that highly qualified teachers, paraprofessionals, and (if appropriate) principals have subject matter knowledge in the academic subjects they teach, or in computer-related technology to enhance instruction. In 2009, The Commission and Council were required by the West Virginia Legislature to coordinate training and development opportunities for members of institutional governing boards. The learning objectives were codified and both began hosting opportunities for training. Training opportunities for Commission institution governing boards have included, but are not limited to, the following: o2010 Board of Governors Summit (nine hours of training credit); o2011 Capitalizing on the Foundation-Institution Partnership (five hours); o2011 Strategic Finance (five hours); o2012 Board of Governors Summit (nine hours); and o2013 Board of Governors Summit (nine hours). For the Fiscal Year 2013 reporting period, annual certifications were received from all institutional board chairs and the Commission's and Council's chairpersons with all current members in compliance. OTHER INNOVATIONS Through the work of the Commission's Consortium for Internationalizing Higher Education, West Virginia students are afforded opportunities to study abroad, participate in an international student exchange program, and become involved in a variety of short-term international experiences. The Consortium organizes annual study abroad bus trips to Canada, provides scholarships for foreign language teachers in training, promotes West Virginia as a destination for international study, and sponsors West Virginia educators to attend the NAFSA Association of International Educators conference each year. Recently, the Commission approved the creation of a new position, Director of International Education. This new position will provide hands-on assistance to institutions and will lead the statewide emphasis on expanding international education in West Virginia. The Chancellor's Post Doctoral Scholars Program supports the development of a diverse faculty in the State of West Virginia through offering talented, new doctorate-holding students opportunities for professional development through advanced teaching and research opportunities at West Virginia institutions of higher learning. The Chancellor's Scholars Program supports efforts at West Virginia University and Marshall University to supplement existing minority faculty diversity efforts at the university. The program supports graduate assistantships, scholarships, and other resources to ensure adequate funding for select doctoral students; an Academic Partnership effort that places minority visiting faculty (graduate students) in teaching roles at select West Virginia public higher education institutions; the annual sponsorship of a colloquium for aspiring minority doctoral candidates; and related services. The Commission sponsors an annual training event for campus student association leaders and newly elected student government leaders from all public higher education institutions in the state. The WV Student Leadership Conference is planned with help from the state-wide Student Affairs Advisory Committee and is held annually at WVU's Jackson Mill State 4-H Camp. INNOVATION WEST VIRGINIA REPORT CARD 2013 | 45 After the Derecho and Hurricane Sandy, WVNET invested almost $2 million in disaster recovery equipment. WVNET is currently running virtual servers for Mountwest Community and Technical College. Additionally, WVNET has purchased massive amounts of data storage equipment to help schools with off-site storage of their critical data. WVNET has put in place a contract for the Ellucian On-Demand Subscription Library (formerly Digital Campus Academy). This affordable web-based training system is designed specifically for administrative end-users (and those people providing functional support) of Ellucian products. Self-paced and highly interactive, each course within this comprehensive learning system provides instructional content and the opportunity for learners to get hands-on practice completing key processes and tasks. Assessments are included for every course. Course materials are kept up to date with product upgrades, so training for new features will be readily available at no additional cost. With the support of a $3.5 million federal grant backed by Governor Tomblin, WVNET upgraded its statewide network to a 10 Gbps fiber optic ring. The ring runs from Pittsburgh [3ROX] to Morgantown [WVNET/WVU] to Charleston [State Government] to Huntington [Marshall University] to Columbus [OARNet], and then back to Pittsburgh for complete self-healing redundancy. This has lowered cost for internet access by more than 50 percent. WVNET joined 29 other regional and state networks from around the country when it began participating in The Quilt. The Quilt is the national coalition of advanced regional networks for research and education, representing 29 networks across the country. Participants in The Quilt provide advanced network services and applications to over 200 universities and thousands of other educational institutions. The Quilt provides a forum for the exchange of ideas between regional education networks which fosters the evolution of these networks to enhance services for constituents. The Commission has now submitted several of the initial reports required by Senate Bill 330 including a major review of existing human resources practices, staffing, and metrics at all of the institutions. The study was prepared by a higher education/human resources consultant, ModernThink. oThe Commission has also satisfied Senate Bill 330's requirements for an emergency legislative rule and is actively working with all affected constituent groups on the remainder of a permanent legislative rule to address all elements of the statute. oCommission staff are on track to complete the market salary survey, which provides the data necessary to update the existing classified salary schedule and to meet the law's requirements for internal pay equity among the different classes of employees. The Commission has begun a wholesale review of existing system-wide human resources policies and legislative/procedural rules. To date, the rule governing affirmative action and equal employment opportunity has been updated and adopted. Another system rule update addressing employee leave is nearing completion and will bring consistency and full regulatory compliance. The Commission is working closely with the state's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) project, WVOASIS, to ensure a good fit between the new state-wide system and the needs of higher education, particularly those related to human resources. The new system will automate and streamline existing human resource department processes. The ERP will serve as a platform for a long-needed uniform Human Resources Information System (HRIS) that will permit more efficient reporting and processing of human resources data and functions. Part of higher education's integration into the project will require a comprehensive review and standardization of employee classification and job titling conventions.46 |West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission and Community and Technical College System of West Virginia STUDENT SUCCESS All Certificates and Degrees Awarded Academic Years 2008 - 2012 WEST VIRGINIA HIGHLIGHTS The number of certificates and degrees awarded in the Community and Technical College System increased 14.5 percent from 3,504 in 2011-12 to 4,011 in 2012-13. Over the five-year period since 2008-09, the number of certificates and degrees conferred increased by 39.8 percent. Eight institutions have increased their certificate and degree production over the five-year period, while two have decreased. NATIONAL CONTEXT According to the National Skills Coalition, middle-skill jobs, which require more than a high school education but not a four-year degree, account for 43 percent (62 million) of jobs today and will continue to account for the largest portion of jobs into the next decade. However, the federal government only provides funding to support 451,000 students (0.25%) out of 165 million students who would potentially benefit from middle skills training. Based on a 2011 report, as of 2009, 54 percent of West Virginia jobs required middle skills, whereas only 45 percent of West Virginians possessed the training needed to fill those jobs (National Skills Coalition). While there has been a significant increase in certificates and degrees awarded in West Virginia, there is still work to be done. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the total number of certificates, associate's degrees, and bachelor's degrees, whether career/technical or academic, awarded by institutions in each academic year. The certificate degree programs require at least 30 credit hours of which six credit hours must be general education. The purpose of the certificate program is to prepare students to enter directly into employment in a specific career and meet the documented workforce needs of employers. Certificate programs also provide the foundation for the Associate in Applied Science (AAS) degree for occupational programs. Like the AAS degree, the goal of certificates is to achieve acceptance as an employment credential. Associate's degrees require a minimum of 60 credit hours and indicate that the student has completed a program of academic development and has achieved a level of performance reflected in student learning outcomes sufficient to progress to upper division collegiate work or to enter directly into specific occupations in the workforce. There are three types of associate's degrees: Associate in Arts (AA), Associate in Science (AS), and the Associate in Applied Science (AAS).COMMUNITY AND TECHNICAL COLLEGE SYSTEM OF WEST VIRGINIA All Certificates and Degrees Awarded 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2011-12 2008-2012 % Change% Change Blue Ridge Community and Technical College 193 307 376 587 802 36.6% 315.5% Bridgemont Community and Technical Colleg e159 135 156 116 197 69.8% 23.9% Eastern WV Community and Technical College 27 51 62 91 108 18.7% 300.0% Kanawha Valley Community and Technical College 253 297 277 326 401 23.0% 58.5% Mountwest Community and Technical College 391 274 376 407 370 -9.1% -5.4% New River Community and Technical College 183 156 140 189 287 51.9% 56.8% Pierpont Community and Technical College 391 403 315 380 424 11.6% 8.4% Southern WV Community and Technical College 323 252 235 243 237 -2.5% -26.6% WV Northern Community Colleg e 369 1,5001,000 500 0 09 10 11 12 08 4,000 3, 600 3,200 2,800 09 10 11 12 082,8702,9893,1903,5044,011 STUDENT SUCCESS WEST VIRGINIA REPORT CARD 2013 | 47 31.5%33.2% 33.5%32.4%30.2% 04 0335 343332313032.4%Student Success Rate Fall Cohorts 2003 - 2007 WEST VIRGINIA HIGHLIGHTS Over a five-year period, the student success rate has increased by about 2.2 percentage points across the Community and Technical College System. Seven institutions have seen gains in their student success rate over the five-year span. Bridgemont Community and Technical College, WV Northern Community College, and West Virginia University at Parkersburg experienced declines over the same time period. Over the last year, four institutions have seen increases in their success rates, while six have seen decreases. NATIONAL CONTEXT The National Governor's Association, Complete College America, and the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) have recognized that the cohorts traditionally used to measure success in baccalaureate granting institutions may not be appropriate for community and technical colleges. As a result, these organizations have created or are in the process of creating new metrics intended to better capture the success of the nation's higher education students. The inclusion of part-time students is one of those changes. Similarly, IPEDS is considering including transfer from a two- to a four-year institution as a successful outcome for community colleges. As these metrics are still in the development stages, national longitudinal data does not yet exist for comparison. ABOUT THIS MEASURE The student success rate is used to evaluate the success of all students who seek a certificate or degree. The success rate is calculated by following a cohort of first-time freshmen, both full- and part-time, for six years. Students are measured as being successful if they achieved one of the following benchmarks: certificate, associate's degree, or transfer to a four-year institution without earning a certificate or associate's degree. This measure is more appropriate for tracking students in two-year institutions because it accounts for the high percentage of students who enroll part-time. It also provides students with intermittent enrollment patterns as a result of work and family obligations, or who need extra time to complete developmental education, enough time to achieve a successful outcome. Student Success Rate Institution 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Blue Ridge Community and Technical College 31.6% 44.5% 43.3% Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission and Community and Technical College System of West Virginia Six-Year Graduation Rate of Associate/Certificate-Seeking Students Fall Cohorts 2003- 2007 WEST VIRGINIA HIGHLIGHTS The six-year graduation rate for students who began in the fall of 2007 was 24 percent, a 3.4 percentage point decrease over the completion rate for the fall 2006 cohort. Over the five-year time period studied, there was a 2.5 percentage point decrease from the 26.5 percent rate for the fall 2003 cohort. The graduation rate for the 2007 cohort ranged from 21.9 to 28.7 percent at West Virginia community and technical colleges. NATIONAL CONTEXT Among those who began as first-time, full-time students at public two-year institutions in SREB states in 2005, 26 percent completed a degree or certificate within six years. The rate was highest in Florida, with a 45 percent attainment rate, and lowest in Louisiana with a 13 percent rate (SREB, 2013). ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the proportion of associate's degree-and certificate degree-seeking students, full- and part-time, who earned any award within six years at any institution in the system. Rates are provided for students' institution of origin. Six-year rates are reported because measuring certificate and associate's degree graduation rates within a three-year period fails to take into account the non-traditional (e.g., non-continuous or part-time) enrollment of many community and technical college students.

This was 4.6 percentage points lower than the 45.4 rate for the previous year's cohort. Between the years of 2011 and 2012, the one-year retention rate increased at four institutions. Over the five-year time span covered, the retention rate decreased 7.3 percentage points from the 48.1 percent retention rate in the fall of 2008. NATIONAL CONTEXT This report utilizes full- and part-time retention rates while national statistics focus on only full-time students. Because of the State's community and technical college student demographic, this combined measurement is useful in West Virginia. However, because national retention rates utilize only full-time students, their rates generally tend to be higher. The proportion of first-time, full-time, degree- or certificate-seeking students at two-year public institutions in SREB states who remained enrolled at the same institution or who transferred to another institution fell from 65 percent for the fall 2009 students returning in fall 2010 to 64 percent of those who first enrolled in 2010 and returned in 2011. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the proportion of students from the previous fall's cohort of first-time, full- and part-time freshmen who returned in the fall of the indicated year to any institution in the state's public system. This is a change from the measure used in previous Report Cards which only assessed the retention rates of full-time students. Further, retention is measured at end-of-term rather than at census as in previous years. Students were included whether or not they were degree or certificate seeking. This first-year retention is an important milestone on the way to completion of a degree or certificate. One-Year Retention Rates Institution 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Blue Ridge Community and Technical College 50.8% 54.9% 55.4% 08 09 50 |West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission and Community and Technical College System of West Virginia Percentage of Students Enrolling in Developmental Education Courses First-Time Freshmen, Fall 2008-2012 WEST VIRGINIA HIGHLIGHTS The percentage of students enrolling in developmental education courses decreased 2.7 percentage points from 65.4 percent in 2011 to 62.7 percent in 2012. The percentage of students enrolled in developmental education courses in 2012 decreased 0.9 percentage points from 2008. The institution with the highest proportion of students enrolled in developmental education in 2012 was WV Northern Community College, while the lowest was Mountwest Community and Technical College. Enrollment in developmental education courses increased between 2011 and 2012 at four institutions and decreased at six. Between 2008 and 2012, enrollment in developmental education courses increased at five institutions and decreased at five others. NATIONAL CONTEXT Identifying reliable comparison data about developmental education course-taking is challenging considering the differences that exist between state and institutional placement policies. A recent report by Complete College America (2012) puts the percentage of students at two-year colleges that require remediation at 51.7 percent, while a survey of students conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (2012) reports that 42 percent of first-time students at community colleges enrolled in at least one developmental education course. ABOUT THIS MEASURE Students enroll in developmental education courses when their scores on the ACT exam or placement tests, such as COMPASS or ACCUPLACER, indicate that they are not ready to undertake college-level work. While students who require developmental education may be recent high school graduates, they may also be adult learners who have been out of school for a number of years.

The percentage of students passing increased 1.5 percentage points compared with the 2008 rate of 62.4 percent. The proportion of students passing developmental math courses increased by 0.5 percentage points from 49.1 percent in 2011 to 49.6 percent in 2012. When compared to passing rates in 2008, the proportion declined 4.7 percentage points. The percentage of students passing reading developmental education courses increased 1.3 percentage points from 67.4 percent in 2011 to 68.7 percent in 2012. The percentage of students passing increased 1.1 percentage points compared with the 2008 rate of 67.6. NATIONAL CONTEXT Data from 26 states compiled by Complete College America show that of those first-time freshman students who enroll in developmental courses at two-year institutions, only 51.7 percent complete them. Among the twelve SREB states that submitted data to Complete College America, 52 percent of first-time freshman students enrolled in developmental courses successfully completed them. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator represents the percent of first-time freshmen passing developmental education courses in the areas of English/writing and math. Students are assigned to developmental courses, which do not carry academic credit, based on their entrance exam scores. As recommended by the SREB, West Virginia has a statewide standard for assessment and placement into developmental courses. Passing these courses is an indicator of being ready to do college-level work.

The proportion of students passing the entry- level English course has fallen by 5.6 percentage points from 42.7 percent in 2007. The proportion of freshmen who took developmental education in math and then passed the subsequent college-level course within two years decreased by 1.2 percentage points from 15.5 percent in 2010 to 14.3 percent in 2011. This number has fallen by 2.2 percentage points from the 2007 level of 16.5 percent. NATIONAL CONTEXT Data from 26 states compiled by Complete College America show that of those first-time entry students who enroll in developmental courses, 22.3 percent complete them and the subsequent college-level course within two years. Among the eleven SREB states that submitted data to Complete College America, 22.8 percent of first-time freshmen who enrolled in developmental courses successfully completed them and the subsequent college-level course within two years. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the proportion of first-time freshman students who, within two years of matriculation, passed the entry-level college courses in English and math after having been enrolled in developmental courses in those areas. It is a good measure of how successful developmental courses are in achieving their goal of preparing students to do college-level work.

Over the five-year time span reported from 2007 to 2011, the number of community college students entering bachelor's degree programs the fall following community college enrollment increased by 16.8 percent from 1,586 students for 2007 to 1,852 for 2011. The number of students who entered a bachelor's degree program in 2011 varied widely by institution with five institutions showing increases over the time period. NATIONAL CONTEXT Transfer rates from community colleges to four-year institutions can vary based on student preparation, background, and motivation. National Student Clearinghouse (2012) data on the 2006 cohort of first-time students found that 33 percent of all college students transferred institutions at least once prior to receiving their bachelor's degree, with a majority of students (37 percent) transferring during their second year of college. Nationally, of all transfers students coming into four-year institutions, 41 percent originated from public two-year institutions. This compares favorably to the 37.6 per- cent of students transferring from a two-year institution to another two-year institution (NSC, 2012). ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the number of students who enroll in a bachelor's degree program the following fall after having been enrolled at a CTCS institution in the fall of the year indicated. Although many programs at the community college aim to prepare students for direct entry into an occupation, another function of community colleges is to provide general education that prepares students to pursue a bachelor's degree.

This represents a 7.1 percent increase from the previous year. There were approximately 60 more students examined. Individual test pass rates ranged from a high of 100 percent for Central Sterile Supply Technician, Healthcare Technology, Pharmacy Technology, Gerontology, and Community Behavioral Health students to a low of a 63.6 percent for Emergency Medical Services students. Of all associate's degree completers who took an Allied Health licensure examination, 87.4 percent passed. This accounts for a 2.1 percentage points increase from the previous year. The exam pass rates ranged from 100 percent for Dental Hygiene, Veterinary Technology, Nuclear Medicine Technology, Massage Therapy, Community Behavioral Technology, and Gerontology students to a low of 72 percent for Emergency Medical Services/ Paramedic Services and Medical Billing and Coding students. Collectively, students completing undergraduate certificates who took industry licensure examinations had a 90.2 pass rate. All but three licensure exams boast a 100 percent passing rate, while no test had a pass rate of less than 75 percent. Undergraduate certificate licensure exams include several different types of curriculum areas including Culinary Arts, Accounting, Power Plant Technology, and Sales. Associate's degree program students who took industry licensure examinations had an 86.3 percent pass rate. Associate's Industry licensure exams include diverse curriculum areas such as Computer Networking Engineering Technologies, Accounting, Welding Technology, Information Technology, and many others. NATIONAL CONTEXT National context data for certification/licensure passage rates for programs at the certificate and associate's degree level are both difficult to obtain and compare. In many cases, different profit and nonprofit organizations offer licensure examinations for the same profession/skill set. Further complicating matters, individual states and regional consortiums have different standards for testing and passage. When passage rates are found, it is difficult to discern the level of degree to which the passage rate applies. An example of best reporting practices comes from the National Council for State Boards of Nursing, which releases regular reports on national licensure passage rates at each degree level. As of June 2013, West Virginia nursing students at the associate's degree level passed their licensure exams at a higher rate (89.8%) than the national average of 84.9 percent. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the number of students finishing either associate's degree or certificate programs who sat for some type of licensure examination and the number who passed that test according to the individual test standards. It provides an external indicator of how well colleges are providing students with the knowledge and skills necessary to enter the workforce.

The number of skill enhancements increased at seven institutions from 2011 to 2012. WVU at Parkersburg had the largest increase at 203.1 percent. The percentage of skill sets increased at two institutions from 2011 to 2012, Bridgemont Community and Technical College (6.3%) and Eastern WV Community and Technical College (144.9%). The percentage of advanced skill sets increased at one institution, Mountwest Community and Technical College (5.3%). NATIONAL CONTEXT According to the SREB, there were 543,599 sub-bachelor's certificates awarded nationally in 2010-11 throughout all sectors. Sub-bachelor's certificates include one- but less than two year certificates and two- but less than four-year certificates. Of these certificates, 39.7 percent were awarded by public institutions and a majority of recipients were women (65.1 %). In West Virginia, 61.7 percent of sub-bachelor's certificates were awarded at a public institution and 66.5 percent of recipients were women (SREB, 2013). In the West Virginia public system, no four-year institutions award sub-bachelor's certificates, so all data is representative of public two-year institutions. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the number of students completing skill enhancement, skill sets, and advanced skill set programs. A skill enhancement is an abbreviated course/workshop that serves to enhance an individual's job performance or job skills and carries a value of less than 15 contact hours or an equivalency of less than one credit hour. A skill set is a course, series of courses, or competencies that prepares individuals for a specific job skill and carries a value of 15 to 179 contact hours or an equivalency of 1 to less than 12 credit hours. An advanced skill set is a series of workforce-related courses or competencies that prepare individuals for a specific skill and carries a value of 180 to 435 contact hours or an equivalency of 12 to less than 30 credit hours. These programs are designed to meet immediate and crucial workforce needs. Because these programs are designed to react to workforce needs, there are often legitimate fluctuations in number of completers from year to year.

The number of certificate completers increased at seven institutions from 2011 to 2012 and declined at three. Since 2008, the number of certificate completers has increased from 485 to 858, a growth of 76.9 percent. The number of those completing certificates has increased at seven of the ten institutions during this time and decreased at three. NATIONAL CONTEXT In 2007, 98.5 percent of two-year public institutions in the United States offered career education. Of the awards distributed at public two-year institutions in 2007, 38.9 percent were career/technical education certificates. The number of students completing certificate programs at two-year public institutions across the country increased by 6 percent from 2006 to 2007 (NCES, 2010). ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the number of students completing certificate programs that are designed to prepare the student to enter directly into employment in a specific career and meet the workforce needs of local employers. The certificate programs require at least thirty credit hours of which six credit hours must be in general education.

At two-year public institutions in the same period, the number decreased 4.9 percent (NCES, 2009). ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the number of students who completed associate's degree programs in the career-technical fields each academic year. Associate's degrees require a minimum of sixty credit hours and indicate that the student has completed a program of academic development and has achieved a level of performance reflected in student learning outcomes sufficient to progress to upper division collegiate work or to enter directly into specific occupations in the workforce.

Since 2008, the number of training hours delivered has risen 22.1 percent. Between 2008 and 2012, four institutions have increased their number of training contact hours. NATIONAL CONTEXT Training contact hours are difficult to compare nationally due to a lack of uniform reporting of this measure in any national publications, but there is evidence that this function of community colleges grew significantly over the last decade. While 38 states require that community colleges report some information on non-credit workforce education, how this is reported varies and in 24 of these states, including West Virginia, the training contact hours are not included in the state's educational data system (American Association of Community Colleges, 2008). ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator provides the number of contact or clock hours delivered in training activities each academic year. It is a measure of instructional productivity determined by multiplying the number of students served by the number of session hours. Training hours are largely non-credit, workforce development and implemented for specific employers either at the work site or on campus.

For-credit enrollment has increased 11.3 percent since fall 2008. Over this five-year span from 2008 to 2012, seven institutions have realized increases in for-credit enrollment while three have experienced a decrease. The largest increase has been 77.2 percent at Blue Ridge Community and Technical College. NATIONAL CONTEXT From 2006 to 2011, while enrollment in two-year public colleges increased 26.5 percent in West Virginia, it increased 22.4 percent nationally and 32.4 percent in the SREB states. Enrollment in two-year colleges made up 32.3 percent of undergraduate enrollment in West Virginia in 2011 while it made up 47.3 percent nationwide and 49 percent in SREB states. The share of undergraduate enrollment made up by two-year institutions increased 3.8 percentage points from 2006 to 2011 in West Virginia while it decreased 2 percent in the nation and increased 3.4 percentage points in SREB states. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator tracks the number of students at each institution taking for-credit classes according to fall, end-of-term data. These figures reveal the number of students working towards a degree or a specific skill set in order to garner the credentials needed to meet West Virginia's workforce needs.

Annual headcount enrollment has increased 11.4 percent since 2008. From 2008 to 2012, seven institutions have realized increases in annual headcount enrollment while three have experienced a decrease. The largest increase has been 63.9 percent at Blue Ridge Community and Technical College. NATIONAL CONTEXT The West Virginia Community and Technical College System is actively engaged in trying to find metrics that are more appropriate and useful for the community college context. This metric does not have national comparisons, but allows community and technical colleges in West Virginia to account for all of the students that they serve. Since many community college programs begin and end in the middle of a term, measuring headcount enrollment only at the end of the fall term fails to accurately depict the number of students attending community colleges. ABOUT THIS MEASURE Annual headcount enrollment is a measure of unduplicated credit headcount enrollment during the summer, fall, and spring.

Adult, for-credit enrollment has increased 20.3 percent since fall 2008. Over this five-year span from 2008 to 2012, eight institutions have realized increases in adult credit enrollment while two have decreased. The largest gain was 87.8 percent at Blue Ridge Community and Technical College. NATIONAL CONTEXT According to SREB data, 34.1 percent of all public postsecondary students enrolled nationally in Fall 2011 were aged 25 to 49, up from 32.4 percent in 2007. For SREB states, the figure was 34.6 percent in 2011 and for West Virginia, it was 30.9 percent (SREB, 2013). West Virginia has made gains, however, in the percentage of its 25 to 49 year-old citizenry who are enrolled in postsecondary education. Although the national average increased from 5.6 to 6.6 percent from 2007 to 2011 and the SREB average grew from 5.0 to 6.3 percent of this age group, West Virginia saw an increase from 4.9 to 5.9 percent. ABOUT THIS MEASURE This indicator tracks the number of non-traditional, adult students at each institution taking for-credit classes as indicated by fall, end-of-term data. This age group is particularly important since national data indicate that the number of high school graduates will decline in the next decade and this age group will become a smaller proportion of West Virginia's population.
