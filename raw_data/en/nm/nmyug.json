Pages: 134. See full description Product Information This book helps you to understand exactly what vaccines do in the body and how that compares to natural immunity. We show how vaccines can appear to 'work' but in so doing, can replace one kind of illness with other potentially more serious conditions; illnesses that are increasing dramatically with the continued use and misunderstanding of the impact of pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines on the human body. You'll be able to understand the difference between acute and chronic illness; the simple steps you can take to avoid increasing the likelihood of developing a chronic illness and with this new knowledge and mind-set you'll be able to escape from the control of the 'disease fear-mongers' that would like you to believe that you and your children cannot live without their drugs. This book also covers some of the ..\". Yes but's\" like: \"What about Polio, Tetanus and Travel vaccines?\" We also turn our attention to the big questions on many parents' minds: \"If I choose not to vaccinate what then? ... If vaccines are ineffective and dangerous, then what happens to our children if they are unvaccinated? ... Is there anything else that can protect our children from serious illness?\" We show how gaining a basic understanding of natural immunity removes so much of the fear associated with childhood illness and how you can actively support the development of you and your child's immune system without putting them under the kinds of stress that contributes towards more serious disease. In addition we illustrate how, contrary to popular belief, you can achieve immunity to all kinds of illnesses without succumbing to the illness or by being vaccinated.
