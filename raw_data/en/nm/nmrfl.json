The combination of points are prescribed based on the pattern of imbalance determined by your practitioner at Saint Lucie Acupuncture and Integrative Medicine. It is recommended to have more than one treatment for the long lasting feeling of well-being, in most cases a treatment protocol runs between 8 to 12 visits for Acute cases (less than a month) and, for Chronic cases 1 to 3 treatment protocols (three months) are needed; your practitioner will evaluate you every visit and determine how often you will have to come, but as you get stronger physically and emotionally, you'll be able to get treated less often. It is recommended to get at least one treatment a week but in most cases two or three treatments a week are necessary at the beginning of your treatment plan. At Saint Lucie Acupuncture and Integrative Medicine we are happy to offer Private and Community Acupuncture. Private Acupuncture Private Acupuncture patients receive care in a private room while laying comfortably in a relaxed environment. This treatment model allows your physician to provide one-on-one individual treatment for patients who prefer to make an appointment and see their acupuncturist in a private setting. Acupuncture is done by putting very thin needles into your skin at certain points on your body. This is done to influence the energy flow, activate the nervous and blood circulation systems. Sometimes heat, pressure, or mild electrical stimulation is used along with needles. Community Acupuncture Community Acupuncture patients receive care in a group setting while resting in a comfortable reclining chair. This treatment model allows us to give effective individual treatments to multiple patients at once thereby reducing your cost. During this treatments only acupuncture is applied. This setting is recommended for simple cases like some types of headaches, allergies, knee pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and maintenance; your physician will let you know if this is appropriated for your case.
