Most back pain is not a serious medical problem. However, it can majorly impact day to day activities and overall quality of life. Many treatment options exist for back pain, some more effective than others. Treatment often depends on the cause of the back pain. More than 85% of low back pain patients are classified as having \"nonspecific\" low back pain, meaning the pain is not coming from any specific cause or serious injury. Clinical guidelines recommend first line treatment using non-pharmacological options including massage, acupuncture, and spinal manipulation. More and more research demonstrates the effectiveness in acupuncture in all areas of pain relief, especially back pain. There are three main ways that acupuncture effectively treats pain. Acupuncture treats pain by increasing circulation to the area which brings fresh blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the area so it has the resources to heal and function properly. Secondly, it reduces inflammation in the area, and lastly, it encourages tight muscles to relax and release. Acupuncture may be combined with other techniques, including dry needling of specific trigger points, infrared heat to relax tight muscles, or others. Often, acupuncture will be combined with cupping. Cupping also encourages increased circulation to the area as well as helping to relax tight muscles. The combination makes for an awesome treatment for pain, and the cupping feels amazing!
