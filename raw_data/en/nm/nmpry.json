Visiting Patients with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 Infection Inpatients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, including end-of-life patients, are allowed one healthy visitor per day for a maximum of two hours at a time. Overnight stays are not allowed except in Labor & Delivery where one healthy visitor per day is allowed 24 hours/day. Because visiting a patient with COVID-19 puts you at risk of catching the illness, Cedars-Sinai strongly recommends virtual visits for all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection\u2014especially if you are not up-to-date on COVID-19 vaccinations. If you do visit a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, you must: - Be free of COVID-19 symptoms and always wear a well-fitted mask at any Cedars-Sinai site. - Check-in at the nurses station upon arrival and before entering a patient room. - Always wear personal protective equipment (PPE) while in the room with the patient.

Wearing PPE incorrectly increases your risk of contracting COVID-19 infection. - Always wash your hands immediately after removing PPE. - Remain physically distant from healthcare workers and other visitors and patients. - Go directly to the patient's room and not congregate in hallways, waiting rooms, or other areas. - Not enter and exit the room multiple times during your visit, except for Labor & Delivery visitors. - Not eat or drink indoors at any time.
