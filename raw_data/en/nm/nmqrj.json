Wellness Movement", "author": "April Long", "url": "https://www.elle.com/beauty/tips/a14843/the-woo-woo-dolls/", "hostname": "elle.com", "description": "Crystals, ayahuasca, and glowing, radiant skin.", "sitename": "ELLE", "date": "2014-11-12", "cleaned_text": "This article appears in the November 2014 issue of ELLE magazine. I'm sitting cross-legged on the floor of the RA MA Institute, a buzzy self-billed \"Yogic Science and Technology\" center situated in a nondescript stripmall-like building in Venice, California, trying not to mess up my single-nostril breathing. Guru Jagat, the Institute's founder and rock-star-caliber Kundalini teacher, whose classes reel in the likes of actor Russell Brand and rapper Eve, is demonstrating the technique (inhale left, exhale right) from her perch on a stage; she's dressed in a white caftan and turban, and a large gong, originally made for Van Halen, frames her from behind like a halo. As my classmates rearrange their sheepskin rugs (the new yoga mat?) and prepare for a 10-minute meditation\u2014soundtracked by electronica with \"consciousness-raising\" lyrics, recorded for Jagat's own record label and broadcast by her iPod via supersize speakers\u2014I sneak a look around. The women here could be actresses, moms, baristas, who knows\u2014they all appear pretty normal, other than the fact that most of them have white scarves wrapped around their head (this, I later learn from the Institute website, \"regulates the vital solar energy in the body\"). When I catch the eye of the friend who invited me here, she smiles and whispers: \"Welcome to L.A.\" The West Coast has long been ground zero for some of the more out-there approaches to health and beauty, from the divine-wisdom-seeking nineteenth-century theosophists who settled in Pasadena to 10 Things I Hate About You actor Andrew Keegan's cultlike \"advanced spiritualism\" religion (briefly: It's called Full Circle, and its unofficial mascot is a talking parrot named Krishna) to, well, the Master Cleanse. Californians have given us colonics, green juices, and hot yoga: They seem willing to try anything that might enhance mind, body, or spirit (especially body\u2014L.A. is definitely a place where wheatgrass shots and Botox shots aren't mutually exclusive). Virtually everyone I meet in Venice has an energy healer or an astrologist. The coolest boutiques in Silver Lake sell crystal pendants and dream catchers, and people here talk about chakras and auras with the same unself-conscious ease as one might discuss what they're having for lunch (which, by the way, probably involves gluten-free tempeh). Former fashion editor Suze Yalof Schwartz's Meditation\u2014a studio with round-the-clock, guided chill-out sessions\u2014makes getting your om on as easy as a stop at In-N-Out Burger, and there's even a 24-hour green-juice ATM in Beverly Hills. What with actress Teresa Palmer claiming she \"manifested\" her husband by surrounding herself with rose quartz crystals and Shailene Woodley's much-publicized penchant for foraging for nettles and eating detoxifying clay, today's Tinseltown is beginning to resemble the La La Land of Annie Hall, in which Jeff Goldblum's character makes a panicked phone call from a Hollywood party because he forgot his mantra. There's something very different from California's New Age heyday of the '70s and '80s, however: This is more of a metaphysical-beauty movement, in which the goal is looking and feeling younger, more attractive, or slimmer, and higher-plane enlightenment is the cherry on top. This time, hipster girls with model looks and A.P.C. wardrobes are leading the revolution. Forget tuning in and dropping out: The new Hollywood bohemian is young, stylish, and decidedly plugged in. DUST BOWL Take, for example, Amanda Chantal Bacon, the contrarily named 31-year-old founder of Moon Juice, a foodie-friendly cold-pressed-juice bar that recently opened its third L.A. location (at the sceney downtown Ace hotel) and broadcasts its beautifully art-directed Instagram feed to more than 10,000 followers. A glowy, bright-eyed walking advertisement for her wares, Bacon trained with famed chef Suzanne Goin before turning her talents toward becoming a wellness mixologist, incorporating ingredients such as yam, cilantro, fennel, maca, and lucuma into Moon Juice's liquid elixirs. Her latest creation, developed in partnership with a Chinese herbalist, is a series of Dusts\u2014blends of powdered medicinal-grade herbs and adaptogenic plants that purport to enhance everything from libido to sleep to brainpower. \"Now that people are receptive to making organic cold-pressed juice and superfoods part of their lives, I wanted to see what I could do to push them a bit farther,\" Bacon says. The whimsical, pastel-labeled Dusts make the principles of ancient Taoist herbology, on which the blends are based, \"accessible and fun,\" Bacon says. And while the claims on the jars might sound a little Shirley MacLaine\u2014the Spirit Dust \"feeds harmony and extra sensory perception,\" for instance\u2014there's hard science to back up the physical benefits of many of the ingredients: The Beauty Dust contains antioxidant-rich goji berries and schizandra, a plant that has been shown to be anti-inflammatory and liver protective, and the Heart Dust contains reishi mushroom, a proven immunity booster (which also, according to Bacon, \"helps you tap into your third eye\"). PEACHES AND HERBS Just as Bacon has injected a spark of culinary creativity and mystical juju into juicing, Sarah Buscho and Marina Storm, the trained herbalists behind organic skin-care line Earth Tu Face, have given all-natural, sustainable skin care a luxe upgrade\u2014with an intrinsic be-kind-to-the-planet-and-beauty-will-follow message. Their products\u2014best-sellers on Net-a-Porter\u2014contain flowers plucked from their own Bay-area gardens, and their site provides complexion-improving tips ranging from using crushed peach leaves to relieve sunburn to applying wet chamomile tea bags on puffy eyes. Despite the fact that cool creatives are now leading the better-living-through-plant-chemistry charge (Alexandra Cassaniti, the Venice-based brain behind hip surfer-girl accessories line Summer Bummer, designs Earth Tu Face's packaging), Buscho and Storm feel strongly about extinguishing any remaining stereotypes: \"There's still some crazy reverse-snobbery in says the Buscho. \"Like, you don't have dreds, so you can't be an herbalist. If you spend any money on the way you look, you can't be legit.\" And while, she adds, \"I wouldn't call myself New Agey, and I get a little put off by that,\" the pair do contend that Earth Tu Face products can work on both the physical and spiritual planes. The Jasmine Blossom Lotion, for example, smooths skin with an ultranourishing blend of organic olive oil and aloe leaf extract, while its fragrance\u2014based on heady jasmine essential oil, which has been shown to boost mental alertness\u2014\"brings a spirit-healing quality,\" says Buscho. \"It's almost like putting an intention on yourself, like calling in your angels.\" FLOWER POWER In some nontraditional medicine practices\u2014including herbalism\u2014plant essences are believed to carry vibrations that affect our bodies. \"It sounds woo woo, but they have real and measurable effects,\" Storm says, citing a recent study published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology showing that human skin cells are kicked into repair mode simply by being exposed to the scent of sandalwood. This is the principle behind the holistic formulations created by Alexis Smart, a former model who has rebooted the flower remedies discovered by physician Edward Bach in the 1930s by using them to target twenty-first-century woes such as anxiety and overwork. Smart's tinctures, intended to be taken daily as a few drops under the tongue, contain distilled concentrates of organic flowers, which, she says, can ease emotional imbalances as well as the physical symptoms they ultimately cause. Though Smart conducts private consultations for custom blends, her premixed elixirs run the gamut from the clematis-containing My Personal Assistant, which purportedly provides get-things-done gusto, to the vervain-containing Beauty Formula No. 8, which, Smart says, \"will relax you in an overall way so that you produce less cortisol, the stress hormone that ages you.\" I can't help but be a touch skeptical (studies show Bach flower remedies work only as well as a placebo), yet Smart identifies my issues after asking me only a few general questions\u2014I have trouble relaxing, I wake up tired, I'm prone to migraines, all true\u2014and recommends a blend called Unburdened, to \"relieve feelings of responsibility\" (yes!) and restore my \"lightness.\" And after taking the drops for the suggested three weeks, I dare say I do\u2014or think I do; thank you, placebo effect\u2014feel a little less high-strung and harried. WAVE LENGTHS Even if your spirit\u2014and therefore, presumably, your frown lines\u2014can't be soothed with a groovy botanical remedy, there's a good chance your hair can be: Stefani Padilla, a stylist who works out of the low-key but trendy Lucas salon in Echo Park, has created La Tierra Sagrada, a range of products containing ayahuasca, the hallucinogenic Amazonian plant that has become something of a party drug for soul-searchers. Padilla, who had experienced hair loss due to medication for rheumatoid arthritis, came up with the idea during a shaman-guided ayahuasca experience in Peru. \"It was like, You're going to make these products, and these are the ingredients you're going to put in them,\" she says. The resulting trio of hair helpers includes The Treatment, a deeply reparative concoction of ayahuasca vine and coconut, babassu, and a split-end-smoothing jojoba oil with rosemary and lavender; and a salt spray that contains palo santo, an antioxidant-rich \"sacred\" South American wood. Don't worry, though\u2014La Tierra Sagrada products don't have psychoactive properties. \"People are like, Oh my God, is it going to get into my scalp and will I totally trip out?\" says Padilla (who, incidentally, now has a head of enviably lustrous waves). \"All it does is protect your hair.\" And although there's no evidence that ayahuasca has any measurable effect on strands, for Padilla, it's more about the \"healing energy\" of the plant\u2014again, it comes down to good vibes. MANIFESTED DESTINY Padilla, like so many people I talk to, attributes the success of her venture to the \"openness\" of her fellow Angelenos. \"There's something really exciting happening right now,\" says Shiva Rose, the former actress and ex-wife of Dylan McDermott who helms holistic-living blog The Local Rose, when I meet her for lunch at Caf\u00e9 Gratitude, the organic eatery where Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z began their 22-day vegan challenge last year. (At Caf\u00e9 Gratitude, you place your order in the form of an affirmation: \"I'll have the I Am Pure,\" I say to the waitress. \"You are pure,\" she replies. \"Do you want to add kimchi to that?\" Many Angelenos consider it to be as mainstream as Starbucks.) \"There's a sense of synergy, and a community of like-minded people who are creating conscious businesses,\" Rose says. \"It's a new philosophy and a new age, where it's not just about money and me, me, me.\" As someone who documents the scene on her site, Rose is full of tips: She recommends holistic facialist Terri Lawton\u2014devotees include Rachel Weisz and Kate Bosworth\u2014who believes that one's \"beauty chi\" can be activated only once all aspects of body and mind are in harmony, and suggests I stop by a caf\u00e9 on Abbot Kinney that serves coffee with ghee, a clarified butter beloved by Ayurvedic practitioners (and Kourtney Kardashian). \"Ghee lubricates your body, your organs, your brain; it creates elasticity and moisture in your skin,\" she says. \"It tastes kind of nasty, though.\" Rose has also recently introduced her own eponymous line of skin care, including an elegant, ultramoisturizing rose facial oil, the packaging idea for which, she says, was \"downloaded\" into her mind during a Kundalini session at RA MA. \"I thought, All white! Of course!\" Admittedly, some of this comes across as a little loony. Padilla blesses her ingredients before bottling them (\"I do a whole ceremony,\" she says. \"It sounds superhippie, it's micronized monatomic gold to \"amplify her projection\" and says that meditation has given her the capacity to \"live in the fourth dimension most of the time\u2014like, I can be here talking to you, but there's another part of me that's communing with nature.\" But something these women are doing is working\u2014with their clear skin and shiny hair, they all project vibrancy and health, not to mention serenity. And, hey, remember when the idea of drinking kale juice sounded pretty crazy? Ultimately, anything that reminds us that inner peace and outer beauty are interconnected must be a good thing. Taking a few drops of flower essence when we're feeling out of whack has to be better than swallowing a double vodka, and for those of us who have lost touch with nature, wearing an aromatherapy oil infused with amethyst crystals or slathering an Amazonian plant extract on our head might very well provide a way of welcoming it back into our lives. \"No matter what, it's about checking in with yourself,\" Rose says. \"It doesn't matter where you are. You don't have to spend hours meditating; just take a minute to check in from time to time. How am I feeling? What do I want to achieve today? That alone will make "}
