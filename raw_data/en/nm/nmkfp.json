These may be worsened by pre-existing health conditions. Ayurveda has a long trusted solution called \"Vyadhikshamatva\". The word Vyadhikshamatva is made up of two words, Vyadhi (meaning - to harm, to injure, to damage, or to hurt) and Kshamatva (meaning - to resist). Vyadhikshamatva promotes the body's power of resistance to the primary occurrence of disease - in other words, building the immunity of our bodies. Ayurveda focuses on prolonging life and promoting perfect health. It's main motto is: Add years to your life and life to your years (\"Swasthasya swasthya rakshanam Aturasya vikar prashamanamcha\"). And where disease is present, Ayurveda has described methods of its eradication and the maintenance of health.

It is observed that during an epidemic/pandemic, those who have a weak digestive fire (Agni) are more prone to infections. And the chances of the infection getting severe are also higher. How can we improve our digestion? - Take easily digestible, warm and light food - Practice intermittent fasting - Drink warm water, add Cumin seeds to warm water and use throughout the day - One can use different types of Ayurvedic herbs capacity Some of the Ayurvedic products to improve digestion available at [www.ayurvedafamily.com](http://www.ayurvedafamily.com): - Dizomap - Triphala - Pachanam - Bowel care - Livomap - Triphala Tablets Regular Detoxification: Ayurveda recommends seasonal Panchakarma procedures to detoxify our body.
