Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) Background The Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted by Congress on March 23, 2010, stipulates that nonprofit hospital organizations complete a community health needs assessment (CHNA) every three years and make it widely available to the public. This assessment includes input from the community and experts in public health, clinical care , and others. The purpose of this community health needs assessment (CHNA) is to identify and prioritize significant health needs of the community served by Dignity Health Dominican Hospital. The priorities identified in this report help to guide the hospital's community health improvement programs and community benefit activities, as well as its collaborative efforts with other organizations that share a mission to improve health. The CHNA report meets the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act require ments, as well as the requirements for California Senate Bill 697, and serves as the basis for implementation strategies that are filed with the Internal Revenue Service. Brief Description of Community Served Santa Cruz County has a population of approxima tely 271,860 and covers 445 square miles. The two major cities are Santa Cruz, located on the northern side of the Monterey Bay, and Watsonville, situated in the southern part of the county. The city of Santa Cruz, which is the county seat, had an estimate d population of 63,993 in 2017. Watsonville had an estimated population of 53,452. The county is 59% non -Latino/White, and 33% Latino, with the remaining 8% of the population comprised of Asian, African American, and other ethnic backgrounds. The median ag e in the county is 37.3 years. Median family income was $90,531 in Santa Cruz County in 2017, higher than California ($76,975), and the nation overall ($70,850). Process & Methods Dignity Health Dominican Hospital, together with its Community Advisors, Ap plied Survey Research (ASR), and other community partners completed a Community Health Needs Assessment process in 2019. The goal was to collectively gather community feedback, understand existing data and trends about health status, and prioritize local h ealth needs. Secondary data were obtained from a variety of sources. Community input was obtained during March, 2019 via key informant interviews with local health experts , and survey with commun ity leaders and health experts , including the local public h ealth department and representatives from the medically underserved, low -income and/or minority populations . Dignity Health Dominican Hospital and ASR also used primary data collected from the biennial Community Assessment Project (CAP) telephone survey conducted with a representative sample of Santa Cruz County residents. The CAP assesses quality of life across six subject areas: the economy, health, public safety, the social environment and the natural environment. Interviews and the survey focused on fo ur main questions: 1. What are the most important health needs in your community? What needs are not being met and which specific groups have greater unmet needs, or special needs? 2. What drivers or barriers contribute to health needs? 3. What are your suggestion s for improvements or solutions to these health needs ? 4. How has the Affordable Care Act impacted access to healthcare for the community? (optional question, time permitting) Needs were prioritized during the focus group and interview process, resulting in the following list. Executive Summary 5 Hea lth Needs Identified by the 2019 CHNA Process Behavioral health (substance use, mental health) Medication -assisted treatment Economic security (housing /homelessness, food insecurity) Need for specialized health c are workers Continuum of C are - access and delivery Obesity/h ealthy eating, active nutrition Access to ca re for undocumented/ immigrants Oral/dental health Climate and health/asthma Prevention Diabetes Seniors - dementia/Alzheimer's Diseases/conditions (Heart disease/stroke, Cancer, Infectious /communicable disease and STIs) Traumatic brain injury care for adults Human trafficking Vaccinations Maternal/child health Violence/injury prevention In the final step, the Dominican Community Advisors (DCA) and selected community experts consolidated and finalized the list of prioritized health needs into the following prioritized health needs (see Attachment 2 for list of participants) . Prioritized Health Needs Behavioral Health For the CHNA, Behavioral Health is the idea that physical and emotional health are connected and can be addressed together to produce the best possible health outcomes. Providers collaborate to address physical, developmental, social, be havioral, and emotional needs, including mental health and substance abuse conditions, depression, health behaviors (including their contribution to chronic medical illnesses), life stressors and crises, and stress- related physical symptoms. Economic Security Economic security includes employment, acc ess to education and/or vocational training, affordable housing, homelessness, food insecurity and other factors related to poverty and lack of income. According to the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) framework, this also includes stable employment, f ood security, and housing stability. Continuum of Care: Prevention, Access and Delivery The Continuum of Care is an integrated system that guides and tracks patients over time through a comprehensive array of health services spanning all levels and inten sity of care. It combines prevention and early intervention, while addressing the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and serving the un/under -insured. For further details, including qualitative data, please refer Identification and Prioritization of Comm unity Health Needs on P. 13 . To review a list of resources that could potentially address the prioritized needs, see P. 21 for an overview of organizations, facilities and programs. \"Over 75% of middle school youth and their parents identified mental health as a priority during our assessment of the needs in the Watsonville community.\" Community Expert \"With the high cost of housing and our problems with homelessness, it is clear people are struggling to meet their basic needs - which ultimately impacts their physical and mental health.\" Community Expert Scope 6 Human Trafficking While not prioritized as part of the CHNA process , Human Trafficking has been identified by Dignity Health as a priority health need because while every state in the nation is affected, California and Nevada record among the highest number of cases . For that reason, Human Trafficking is prioritized by Domi nican Hospital. Next Steps This CHNA report was adopted by the Dig nity Health Dominican Hospital Community B oard of Directors on May 22, 2019 . The report is widely available to the public on the hospital's website, and a paper copy is available for inspection upon request at Dominican Hospital's Community Health Integration Services Office . Written comments on this report can be submitted to Dominican Hospital's Community Health Integration Services Office at 1555 Soquel Ave., Santa Cruz, CA 9506 5, or by em ail to Michaella.Siplak@dignityhealth.org. SCOPE Dignity Health Dominican Hospital collaborated with local health officials, County Health Department representatives, and community benefit organizations to conduct this community health needs assessment of Santa Cruz County. With this assessment, Dignity Health Dominican Hospital will develop strategies to tackle these prioritized needs and improve the health and well- being of community members. Note that for the purposes of this assessment, \"community hea lth\" is not limited to traditional health measures. This definition includes indicators relating to the quality of life (e.g., access to health care, impact of new technology, affordable housing, child care, education, and employment), the physical environ mental, and social factors that influence health, as well as the physical health of the county's residents. This reflects Dignity Health Dominican Hospital's view that community health is affected by many factors and cannot be adequately understood without consideration of trends outside the realm of health care. The 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment is designed to serve as a tool for guiding policy and planning efforts, and the information provided here will be used to formulate strategies to improve the quality of life for Santa Cruz County residents. This assessment will also serve to assist in developing Community Benefit Plans pursuant to Legislative Bill 697, as well as assist in meeting IRS requirements for Community Health Needs Assessment pursu ant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (See Attachment 1 for the IRS Checklist). Scope 7 ACA and SB 697 CHNA Requirements Activity or Requirement Required by ACA Required by SB 697 Conduct a CHNA at least once every 3 years Yes Yes Document a separate CHNA for each individual hospital Yes Identify and prioritize community health needs Yes Yes Gather input from specific groups/individuals, including public health experts as well as community leaders and representatives of high -need populations, including minority groups, low -income individuals, and medically underserved populations Yes Identify resources potentially available to address the health needs Yes Make the CHNA findings widely available to the public Yes Adopt an Implementation Strategy Report to meet needs identified by CHNA Yes Yes File an Implementation Plan with designated government agency Yes Yes In conducting this Community Health Needs Assessment, the goals of Dignity Health Dominican Hospital are twofold: To produce a functional, comprehensive community health needs assessment that can be used for strategic planning of community programs and as a guideline for policy and advocacy efforts; and To promote collaborative efforts in the community and develop collaborative projects based on the data, community input, identified service gaps, and group consensus. Identity & Qualifications of Consultan ts In 1994, Applied Survey Research (ASR), a nonprofit social research firm, was contracted by the United Way to incorporate best practices from other assessment efforts across the nation into a community assessment model that would provide public and private interests with clear information about past trends and current realities. Under the guidance of the C ommunity Assessment Project Steering Committee, ASR continues to manage the project to this day, collecting secondary (pre -existing) data and condu cting a biennial community survey for primary data. For the Dignity Health Dominican Hospital CHNA, ASR conducted primary research , collected secondary data, synthesized primary and secondary data, facilitated the processes of identification of community health needs and assets and of prioritization of community health needs, and documented the processes and findings into a report. ASR was uniquely suited to provide Dignity Health Dominican Hospital with consulting services rel evant to conducting the CHNA. The team that participated in the work - Susan Brutschy, Jennifer Anderson - Ochoa, and Audra Gallant - brought together diverse, complementary skill sets and various schools of thought (public health, anthropology, sociology, psychology, education, and poli cy analysis). About our Hospital 8 In addition to their research and academic credentials, the ASR team has a 35 -year history of working with vulnerable and underserved populations such as young children, teen mothers, seniors, low -income families, immigrant families, families who have experienced domestic violence and child maltreatment, the homeless, and children and families with disabilities. ASR's expertise in community assessments is well -recognized. ASR won a first place award in 2007 for having the best community ass essment project in the country. They accomplish successful assessments by using mixed research methods to help understand the needs in question, and by putting the research into action through designing and facilitating strategic planning efforts with stak eholders.

Our community benefit also includes monetary grants we provide to not -for-profit organizations that are working together to improve health on significant needs identified in our Community Health Needs Assessment. Community Served The Internal Revenu e Service defines the \"community served\" by a hospital as those individuals residing within its hospital service area. A hospital service area includes all residents in a defined geographic area and does not exclude low -income or underserved populations. Geographic Description of Community Served Santa Cruz County has a population of approximately 271,860 and covers 445 square miles. The two major cities are Santa Cruz, located on the northern side of the Monterey Bay, and Watsonville, situated in the sout hern part of the county.1 The city of Santa Cruz, which is the county seat, had an estimated population of 63,993 in 2017. Santa Cruz is one of California's most popular seaside resorts with its historic Boardwalk, spectacular coastline, and accessible beaches. The City of Watsonville is the center of the county's agricultural activity, with major industries including food harvesting, canning, and freezing. In 2017, City of Watsonville had an estimated population of 53,452. Other incorporated areas in the county include the cities of Scotts Valley and Capitola. Approxim ately 48% of the population lives in the unincorporated parts of the county, including the towns of Aptos, Davenport, Freedom, Soquel, Felton, Ben Lomond and Boulder Creek, and districts inclu ding the San Lorenzo Valley, Live Oak, and Pajaro. 2 Demographic Profile of Community Served The county is 59% non -Latino/White, and 33% Latino, with the remaining 8% of the population comprised of Asian, African American, and other ethnic backgrounds. The median age in the county is 37.3 years. Seniors aged 65 and over represent 14% of the County population. The County's largest racial/ethnic group is non -Latino White (59%), and the second largest group is Latino (33%). Most Santa Cruz County residents had a high school diploma (86%). Approximately 15% of the County's population lives below 100% of the federal poverty line.1 Median family income was $90,531 in Santa Cruz County in 2017, higher than the state ($76,975), and the nation overall ($70,850).3 The annual average unemployment rate for the county overall w as 4.9% in 2018. The unemployment rate has steadily declined from a high of 13 .3% in 2010 .4 1 United States Census Bureau (2018). American Community Survey, 2013 -17 5 -Year Estimates.

About our Hospital 11 The median sales price for homes in Santa Cruz County was $791,500 as of February 2019, while the median estimated market rate rent across all home types in the cou nty was $3,118 in the same period.5 DEMOGRAPHIC Total No high school diploma: 14% Central California Alliance for Health Members enrolled in Medi- Cal: 69,077 (25% of County population) Other area hospitals: 2 Medically underserved areas/populations: Watsonville, Freedom, and City of Santa Cruz (UCSC region) With regard to medically underserved populations in Santa Cruz County: In 2017, 83% of Latino CAP Survey respondents reported being able to receive the health care they needed in the past 12 months, while 91% of white respondents said the same. Of CAP respondents who were unable to receive health care in the last 12 months, 40% said it was because of lack of insurance, and 13% said care was too expensive. One tool used to assess health need is the Community Need Index (CNI) created and made publically available by Dignity Health and Truven Health and Truven Health Analytics. The CNI analyzes data at the zip code level on five factors known to contribute or be barriers to health care access: income, culture/language, education, housing status, and insurance coverage. Scores from 1. 0 (lowest barriers) to 5.0 (highest barriers) for each factor are averaged to calculate a CNI score for each zip code in the community. Research has shown that communities with the highest CNI scores experience twice the rate of hospital admissions for amb ulatory care sensitive conditions as those with the lowest scores. Santa Cruz County's CNI scores clearly indicate that the greatest areas of need are in South County: Freedom (4.4) and Watsonville (4.2). CNI scores also indicate need in the City of Santa Cruz near the University of California Santa Cruz campus (4.0) . These scores track with CAP data and qualitative data acquired through key informant interviews and surveys of key health experts . 5 Zillow Research (2019). Zillow Rent Index, February 2019.

Retrieved from http://cni.chw -interactive.org/ Process & Methods of the 2019 -2022 CHNA 13 State and County Context Following the institution of the ACA in January 2014, Medi -Cal was expanded in California to low -income adults who were not previously eligible for coverage. Specifically, adults earning less than 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (approximately $15,856 annually for an individual) are now eligible for Medi- Cal. In 2014, \"Covered California,\" a State Health Benefit Exchange, was created to provide a marketplace for healthcare coverage for any Californian. In addition, Americans and legal residents with incomes between 139% and 400% of the Federal Poverty Level can benefit from subsidized premiums.6 Covered California reports that as of the month of December 2018, there were 11 ,200 residents actively enrolled within Santa Cruz County .7 In 2017, the Central California Alliance for Health reported 52% of their current Santa Cruz County Medi - Cal membership being La tino, 31% white, and 17% other race/ethnicity. Over half (51%) of their membership was located in South County. Between 2010 and 2017 the Alliance has seen a 106% increase in members enrolled in Medi -Cal in the county. A total of 69,077 members were report ed by the Alliance in 2017. 8 PROCESS & METHODS OF THE 2019 -2022 CHNA ASR and Dignity Health Dominican Hospital worked to collect the primary and secondary data requirements of the CHNA. The CHNA data collection process took place over three months and culminated in a report written for Dignity Health Dominican Hospital in May of 2019. Primary Qualitative Data (Community Input) Dignity Health Dominican Hospital contracted with Applied Survey Research (ASR) to conduct primary research. They used three strategies for collecting community input: key informant interviews with health experts, an online survey with professionals, and telephone surveys with 700 randomly selected residents as part of the yearly Community Assessment Project. When all interviews and online surveys had been conducted, the team used qualitative research tools to analyze the information and tabulated all heal th needs that were mentioned, along with he alth drivers discussed. ASR made a list of all of the conditions that had been mentioned by key informants or online survey respondent s, and facilitated a prioritization process with DCA , hospital leaders, and oth er local health experts . 6 http://www.healthforcalifornia.com/covered -california 7 Covered California Active Member Profile. 8 Central California Alliance for Health.

Process & Methods of the 2019 -2022 CHNA 14 Over the past twenty years, a consortium of public and private health, education, human service, and civic organizations, convened by the United Way of Santa Cruz County, have sponsored the Community Assessment Project (CAP), a c ollaborative project to measure and improve the quality of life in Santa Cruz County by: Raising public awareness of human needs, changing trends, emerging issues, community assets and challenges; Providing accurate, credible and valid information on an ongoing basis to guide decision making; Setting community goals that will lead to positive healthy development for individuals, families, and communities; and Supporting and assisting collaborative a ction plans to achieve the community goals. Community Leader Input In all, ASR consulted with 22 community representatives of various organizations and sectors. These representatives either work in the health field or improve health conditions by serving those from the target populations. In the list below, the number in parentheses indicates the number of participants from each sector. Santa Cruz County Public Health Department ( 1) Santa Cruz County Health & Hospital System ( 7) Other Santa Cruz County em ployees ( 1) Nonprofit agencies ( 8) Business sector ( Organizers/Volunteers ation sector (1 ) Funder (2 ) See Attachment 2 for the name s and affiliation s of participants . Key Informant Interviews In March, ASR conducted primary research v ia key informant interviews with three Santa Cruz County experts from various organizations. In March , ASR interviewed the Director of Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency, the Director of Santa Cruz County Hum an Services Department, and the Director o f Santa Cruz County Behavioral Health. These experts had countywide experience and expertise. Experts were interviewed in person or by telephone for approximately one hour. Informants were asked to: identify the top health needs of their constituencies and barriers to accessing care , describe how healthcare has changed in the post -Affordable Care Act environment, and to offer solutions or suggestions for policy changes that would mitigate the needs they identified . Online Survey Also in March, ASR conducted an online survey with local non -profit leaders with community health expertise. The online survey questions were the same as those for the key informants. See Attachment 3 for key informant interview protocol and online survey questions. Process & Methods of the 2019 -2022 CHNA 15 Resident Input and the Santa Cruz County Community Assessment Projec t Dignity Health Dominican Hospital utilized the primary data collected and analyzed in the Santa Cruz County Community Assessment Project (CAP) to access resident input for the 2019-2022 CHNA. The CAP assesses quality of life across six subject areas: the economy, education, health, public safety, the social environment, and the natural environment. The CAP features over 90 indicators across these fields, including both primary an d secondary data. Biennially, ASR conducts a telephone survey of a representative sample of approximately 700 S anta Cruz County residents: 2017 was a survey year. ASR uses a 5 -step Assessment Process outlined here. Over 300 community stakeholders particip ate in setting goals for the CAP project. The goals for the health section of the report are set by the Health Improvement Partnership (HIP), a local coalition of public and private health care leaders dedicated to increasing access to health care and building stronger local health care systems. The HIP has representation from the public health department in addition to community clinics who are serving the medically underserved, low -income, and minority populations. The goals from CAP are taken into accoun t when identifying top health needs. CAP Methodology Sample Selection and Data Weighting In 2017, 793 surveys were completed with county residents. Telephone contacts were attempted with a random sample of residents 18 years or older in Santa Cruz County. Potential respondents were selected based on phone number prefixes, and quota sampling was employed to obtain the desired geographic distribution of respondents across North County, South County, and the San Lor enzo Valley. Q uotas were also set for Latino respondents in order to increase th is figure . In order to address the increasing number of households without landline telephone service, the sample included wireless -only and wireless/land - line random digit dial prefixes in Santa Cruz County. All cell pho ne numbers were dialed manually (by hand) to comply with Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) rules. While cell phone numbers are selected based on the billing address within the county boundaries, respondents were additionally screened for geography, as cell phones are not necessarily located where the number came from originally or is billed in the case of shared plans. Process & Methods of the 2019 -2022 CHNA 16 As previously mentioned, quotas were used with respect to respondents' location of residence. The quotas were designed to obtain su fficient samples to allow generalization to the overall population within each of the three designated geographic areas (North County, South County, and the San Lorenzo Valley). This method of sampling necessitated an over -sample of the San Lorenzo Valley due to its small size in relation to the rest of the county. The over- sampling of San Lorenzo Valley allowed for reliable comparisons with the other two regions (North County and South County). In total 793 surveys were completed, 274 in North County, 269 in South County, and 250 in San Lorenzo Valley. Data from the 2017 survey were \"weighted\" along several demographic dimensions prior to data analysis. Data weighting is a procedure that adjusts for discrepancies between demographic proportions within a sam ple and the population from which the sample was drawn. For example, within the 2017 survey, the sample was 60% female and 40% male, whereas the population in Santa Cruz County is very near to evenly split between the two genders. When the data are weighted to adjust for the over- sampling of females, answers given by each female respondent are weighted slightly downward, and answers given by each male respondent are weighted slightly upward, thus compensating for the disproportionate sampling. The survey data for 2017 were simultaneously weighted along the following demographic characteristics: gender, ethnicity, and geographic location. Weighting for both ethnicity and gender was performed to be region -specific, based on 2010 Census data, in order to acco unt for differences across the three regions of Santa Cruz County. The weighted data were used in the generation of the overall frequency tables, and all of the cross -tabulations, with the exception of the regional cross -tabulations. For the regional cross - tabulations, the regional weights were dropped so that the San Lorenzo Valley oversample could be utilized. There are important characteristics of weighted data that need to be mentioned. Within a weighted data set, the weights of each person's responses are determined by that individual's characteristics along the weighted dimensions (gender, ethnicity, geographic location). Thus, different respondents will have different weights attributed to their responses, based on each person's intersection along the three weighted demographic dimensions. Sample Representativeness A sample size of 793 residents provides 95% confidence that the opinions of survey respondents do not differ from those of the general population of Santa Cruz County by more than +/ -3.5%. This \"margin of error\" is useful in assessing how likely it is that the responses observed in the sample would be found in the population of all residents in Santa Cruz County if every resident were to be polled. It is important to note that the margin o f error is increased as the sample size is reduced. This becomes relevant when focusing on particular breakdowns or subpopulations in which the overall sample is broken down into smaller groups. In these instances, the margin of error will be larger than t he initially stated interval of 3.5%. It should be understood that all surveys have subtle and inherent biases. ASR has worked diligently with the CAP Steering Committee to reduce risks of bias and to eliminate identifiable biases. One remaining bias in this study appears in the area of respondent self- selection; the capturing of opinions only of those willing to contribute approximately 20 minutes of their time to participate in this community survey. Identification and Prioritization of Community Health Needs 17 Secondary Quantitative Data Collection ASR complied data and provided comparisons with statewide averages where possible. Secondary (pre - existing) data were collected from a variety of sources, including but not limited to, the U.S. Census Bureau; federal, state, and local government agencies; health care institutions; and computerized sources through online databases and the Internet. Whenever possible, multiple years of data were collected to present trends . IDENTIFICATION AND PRIORITIZATION OF COM MUNITY HEALTH NEEDS Identification of Communit y Health Needs As described in Process & Metho ds of the 2019 -2022 CHNA on P. 9 , a variety of experts and service providers were consulted about the health needs in the community. They identified a diverse set of health conditions and demonstrated a clear understanding of the health behaviors and other drivers (environmental and clinic al) that affect health outcomes. They spoke about behavioral health, homelessness and the social determinants of health , access to care, clinical practices that work and don't work, and their overall perceptions of the community's health. Qualitative Dat a Findings Dignity Health Dominican Hospital sought to understand specific aspects of community health during the 2019 CHNA . Starting with a solid understanding of the health conditions, drivers, and social determinants of health that are concerning to the community, ASR dove deeper into these questions during focus key informant interviews and in the survey: 1. What are the most important health needs in your community? What needs are not being met and which specific groups have greater unmet needs, or specia l needs? 2. What drivers or barriers contribute to health needs? 3. What are your suggestions for improvements or solutions to these health needs ? 4. How has the Affordable Care Act impacted access to healthcare for the community? (Optional question, time permittin g) Identification and Prioritization of Community Health Needs 18 Health Needs ASR conducted key informant interviews and an online survey with key community members that resulted in the list of prioritized community health needs listed below. Examples of u nmet health needs included in the list are economic insecuri ty, behavioral health, diabetes, dental/o ral health, obesity, chronic health conditions, and access to care for undocumented immigrants . Specific populations identified as having greater need included Latinx, undocumented immigrants, and Oaxacans , seniors, people experiencing homelessness, long term drug/alcohol users, people with untreated mental health and substance use issues, and the under -insured. Watsonville and S outh C ounty were identified as area s having greater health needs. Drivers and Bar riers The lack of affordable housing and homelessness were repeatedly mentioned as driver s or barrier s that contribute to health needs. Other drivers/barriers mentioned included poor access to services, cultural stigma, affordability of care, and lack of safety net services. Suggestion for Improvements or Solutions Suggestions for improvements or solutions included increased diversion to and investment in early onset counseling, improved training for providers in medication -assisted treatment, building mor e high -density housing and public investment in affordable housing, increasing resources to the Health Information Exchange to improve care coordination among providers, and better coordination of complex health care needs. Policy ideas include mandating e arly screening for adverse childhood experiences , changing/updating zoning codes to make it easier for multi- unit housing and A ccessory Dwelling Units, and ensuring state protection of key ACA elements. Health Care Access ASR also sought to understand how the Affordable Care Act continues to impact residents' access to healthcare, including affordability of care. This question was addressed with several discussion points including awareness about health insurance and healthcare access, costs and affordabili ty of healthcare, sufficiency of healthcare benefits, and the utilization of primary versus emergency care. Awareness about how to obtain health insurance and health care . Experts felt that residents are aware of how to access health insurance and health care, but some do not have the \"health systems literacy\" that they need to navigate the system and make choices. Popul ations who may be less aware, have more difficulty, or are afraid of accessing insurance are undocumented immigrants, those who do not spe ak English, those with limited/no literacy, and homeless persons who don't have the documentation necessary to enroll. Many lack the financial resources to pay for care, even with subsidies. Fear of the recent Public Charge Rule also keeps some immigrants from accessing insurance and/or care. Proportions Insured. Experts reported an increase in the number of insured since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was instituted; however wait times and fear keep people from accessing care. Difficulties affording insurance and care. Experts working with at- risk, low -income populations reported that their clients were having difficulty affording insurance (premiums and co -pays) , even with subsidies. Primary care versus emergency care. Experts who serve Medi -Cal patients in community clinics report that more of their patients are assigned to primary care physicians. However, due to long wait times and difficulties in making appointments, many patients wait until their condition becomes urgent and end up in the ER. Identification and Prioritization of Community Health Needs 19 Health Needs Data Synthesis In order to generate a list of health needs, ASR started from Dignity Health Dominican Hospital's 2016 CHNA list of needs. After completing the key informant interviews and the survey, ASR finalized the list of significant health needs for Santa Cruz County and shared this list with the DCA and other health experts for final review and prioritization. A total of 16 needs were identified and are listed below, in alphabetical order. Summarized Descriptions of Santa Cruz County's Community Health Needs Access to Care for Undocumented Immigrants was mentioned by both service providers and health professionals as a health need in Santa Cruz County. Significant factors include the current climate of fear due to national policies (including the Public Charge Rule ) and rhetoric, being afraid to access services due to undocumented status, and uncertainty about insurance eligibility. Mono -lingual, migran t workers who are uninsured were identified as a particularly at- risk group. Behavioral Health (Substance Use Disorder, Mental Health, and Medication -assisted Treatment) was prioritized in the 2016 and 2019 CHNA as one of the three most significant health needs in Santa Cruz County. CAP s urvey data clearly indicate that alcohol use, substance use, and mental health care are needs within the county. Health experts and local stakeholders indicated that lack of resources for prevention, limited supply of ment al healthcare providers and substance use treatment options, stigma, and adverse childhood experiences contribute to this being a significant need.

Asthma is considered a significant public health burden an d its prevalence has been on the rise nationwide since 1980. Asthma affects people of every race, sex, and age. However, significant disparities in asthma morbidity and mortality exist, in par ticular for low -income and minority populations. 9 In Santa Cruz County since 2014/15 , the prevalence of asthma is decreasing among the white popul ation, while increasing among the Latino population.

CAP survey data indicate that some residents do lack a regular source of health care. Additionally, disparities in being able to receive neede d health care exist between white and Latino survey respondents in the county. Local health experts expressed the need for more preventative services, shorter wait times for appointments, and more specialized healthcare workers. In addition they indicated that barriers to access - such as language, immigration status, cultural competency, confusion on how to navigate the system, and fear - need to be addressed to ensure equitable access to care.

Poor health outcomes such as infectious disease, stress, and behavioral health issues are linked to crowded housing and homelessness. Local data indicate an upward trend in homelessness throughout the county and in students considered eligible for services under the McKinney -Vento Act related to housing and homelessness. Due to the high cost of living , insecure housing, poverty and food insecurity have serious impacts on the health and well \u2014being of Santa Cruz County residents, and remain as significant health needs expressed by all health experts.

Human Trafficking has been identified by Dignity Health as a health need because while every state in the nation is affected, California and Nevada record among the highest number of cases. Findings from the Massachusetts General Human Trafficking Initiative indicate that approximately 90% of victims have had a health care encounter while being held against the ir will and were not identified. Maternal/Child Health and Vaccinations were mentioned as health needs in Santa Cruz County. Community concerns focused on teen pregnancy, although data show that the rate of teen births in the county i s less than the state rate of teen births. Service providers and health professionals were particularly concerned with the decline in vaccinations and a recent measles outbreak . Local health data indicate that Latinas and women of color were more likely to have fewer prenatal visits than the county overall. State health department data also indicate a need for increased student immunizations.

Need for Specialized Health Care Workers is an ongoing health need in Santa Cruz County . Service provider s and health professionals expressed the need for more and varied specialized doctors and practitioners. Obesity, Healthy Eating, A ctive N utrition was identified as a health care need in the community. CAP survey data suggest a steady increase in overweight or obese survey respondents. Local education data also suggest a decline in students achieving key physical fitness goals. Regular physical activity can improve health and quality of life regardless o f age or the presence of a chronic disease or disability. Among adults and older adults, physical activity can lower the risk of early death, stroke, type 2 diabetes, breast and colon cancer, and depression.11 The percentage of overweight and obese adult CAP respondents has steadily increased since 2007, with a higher proportion of Latino respondents being overweight or obese.

Good oral health improves a person's ability to speak, smile, smell, taste, touch, chew, swallow, and make facial expressions to show feelings and emotions. However, oral diseases, from cavities to oral cancer, cause pain and disability.12 CAP survey data indicate a downward trend in dental car e among survey respondents.

In order to identify significant health needs, ASR facilitated a discussi on with the DCA and other health experts , who reviewed all of the quantitative and qualitative data, the list of significant health needs and their impact on the community. They were given the option to add or delete needs, and then went through a prioriti zation pr ocess to narrow the list to three , combining and redefining some to fit the specific needs of t he county. (Data collection me thods are further described in Process & Methods of the 2019 -2022 CHNA on P. 9 .) The top three health needs, as prioritized by the DCA are listed here, and explained in further detail below . 1. Behavioral Health 2. Economic Security 3. Continuum of Care : Prevention, Access and Delivery 4. Human Trafficking* Behavioral Health (S ubstance Use/ Mental Health ) For the CHNA, behavioral h ealth is the idea that physical and emotional health are connected and can be addressed together to produce the best possible health outcomes. Providers collaborate to address physical, developmental, social, behavioral, and emotional needs, including mental health and substance abuse conditions, depression, health behaviors (including their contribution to chronic medical illnesses), life stressors and crises, and stress- related physical symptoms. Selected comments from th e DCA and other health experts \"Systematic screening, assessment and treatment for early childhood/family behavioral health as well as accessible behavioral health resources for adolescents is an ongoing need expressed by service providers and education pr ofessionals throughout the county. \" \"Problems with substance use disorder and mental health disorders cut across all economic levels and there are not enough services to meet the need. Many people are going without behavioral health care which has a huge i mpact on the wider community. \" \"Over 75% of middle school youth and their parents identified mental health as a priority during our assessment of the needs in the Watsonville community. \" \"More than 20% of the population has mental health issues. These issu es lead to other community and family problems. We have not access to mental health providers.\" \"Prevention services targeted to youth would help the community long term; preventative services need to include afterschool programs and target young children and families to help them meet their needs to help avoid starting down a challenging path in the first place.\" \"Many homeless issues are rooted in behavioral health.\" \"There is a lack of understanding of how to navigate the complex patchwork that is carved out of the health care system. Behavioral health should be part of the system - otherwise it creates barriers and hoops to receiving care.\" \"Dollars are diverted to treatment, there is not enough to invest upstream.\" Identification and Prioritization of Community Health Needs 35 Suggestions for Improvement or Solutions Recommended opioid prescribing practices followed county -wide Increase diversion and investment to early onset counseling, ensure improved reimbursement rates for services Early screening for Adverse Childhood Experiences Train providers about best practices in medication -assisted treatment Economic Security Economic security includes employment, access to education and/or vocational training, affordable housing, homelessness, food insecurity and other factors related to poverty and lack of income . According to the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) framework, this also includes stable employment, food security, and housing stability. Selected comments from the DCA and other health experts \"It is hard/nigh impossible to be healthy without a stab le permanent home. \" \"Economic security is a pressing need in our community. With the high cost of housing and our problems with homelessness, it is clear people are struggling to meet their basic needs -- which ultimately impacts their physical and mental health. \" \"Addressing barriers within social determinants of health are critical in truly elevating communities.\" \"Economic security is a major issue in Santa Cruz. People on fixed income can't afford to live here. If they live here then they can't afford f ood and drugs. Homelessness is a problem for community. Illegal drug use, disease transmission, frequent ER visits are some of the consequences of being homeless.\" \"Social determinants of health have a huge impact on health. The cost of living in Santa Cru z is very challenging.\" Suggestions for Improvement or Solutions Build more density housing on county land The county could play a role by changing or updating zoning codes to make it easier to zone for and build multi- unit housing or additional dwelling units. There could be more investment by public entities of foundations in 'rental assistance programs' that prevent people from becoming homeless or over -crowding into a housing unit. Another bond measure on the next ballot for affordable housing. Much mo re public investment in affordable housing units, sheltering services or rental assistance programs for our most vulnerable members of the community. Funding streams to address emerging needs and social determinants of health Workforce housing Capital inve stments Public investment in building more affordable housing units, more investment in sheltering services county -wide, increased funding for rental assistance programs Additional outreach services Housing of different levels based on an individual's need s Funding (ongoing - not one time) to support the sheltering of homeless adults and families and the provision of expanded healthcare services in the community Identification and Prioritization of Community Health Needs 36 Continuum of Care : Prevention, Access and Delivery The Continuum of Care Approach is an integrated system that guides and tracks patients over time through a comprehensive array of health services spanning all levels and intensity of care. It combines prevention and early intervention, while addressing the Social Determinants of Health and serving the un/under -insured. Selected comments from the DCA and other health experts \"Ultimately the complex process of establishing accessible and integrated family -friendly, whole -person care in a framework that incorporates the social det erminants of health will fundamentally help our community address multiple priority health needs in an effective and sustainable manner. \" \"Chronic diseases are at epidemic levels, especially in our most vulnerable populations (i.e. south county Hispanic po pulation), which affects quality of life and impacts our health care delivery systems. We need to invest more money in efforts to prevent these diseases before they arise.\" \"Prevention services targeted at youth would help the community long term, preventa tive services need to include after school programs and target young children and families to help them meet their needs to help avoid stating down a challenging path in the first place.\" \"We must look through an equity lens when it comes to health and add ressing chronic diseases, including more upstream, prevention approaches.\" \"An ounce of prevention... recent trends in decreased vaccination rates further justify the already established importance of maternal/early childhood health provision/prevention.\" \"Prevention of disease by immunization, good eating habits, exercise and weight control are essential.\" \"More access to healthy food and activities will help health needs; there are lots of options but they are expensive and that makes them not accessible to everyone.\" \"A medical home and access to care, especially dental, is lacking for the low income and uninsured.\" Suggestions for Improvement or Solutions Advocacy for universal health care at the state level Dental benefits in Medicare, adult dental mand ated in Medicaid State protection of ACA elements Department of Health Care Services Medicaid waiver that explores care coordination models More resources to Health Information Exchange for better care coordination among providers Kaiser Permanente, Sutter /PAMF and Dignity Health to better align community benefit with CORE framework to incre ase impact Data sharing platforms More primary care and specialty care services through stronger partnerships with key providers Systems approach to care coordination, including HIE adoption of Safe Prescribing Guidelines in all care settings.

Dignity Health hospitals are deeply embedded in communities that have transien t populations and high rates of poverty, unemployment, and family instability that can create conditions ripe for human trafficking. Dignity Health clinicians and staff know that they are s eeing victims in their facilities. However, findings from the Massa chusetts General Human Trafficking Initiative indicate that approximately 90% of victims have had a health care encounter while being held against the ir will and were not identified. Dignity Health Dominican Hospital has assigned a task force to address this need, and trains key staff to identify signs of a human trafficking. ( See Attachment 7 for Dignity Health Dominican Hospital's Human Trafficking Assessment of Community Resources, Attachment 8 for Dignity Health D ominican Hospital's Policy Statement on the Identification and Reporting of Abuse and Neglect, and Attachment 9 - an example of an informational poster about Abuse and Human Trafficking displayed in key locations in the hospital.) *While not identified as a priority health need during the Dominican Hospital CHNA process, Dignity Health has placed a system -wide priority on this need. Resources Potentially A vailable to A ddress Prioritized H ealth Needs While resources are available to address the needs of the community, the needs are too significant for any one organization. Making a substantial and upstream impact will require the collaborative efforts of community organizations, local government, local business leaders, and institutions.

CHNA Requirement Information Required Section Reference CHNA Report Reference/ Comments Conducting a CHNA Date a CHNA is conducted A hospital facility will be considered to have completed the step of making a CHNA report widely available to the public on the date it first makes the CHNA report widely available to the public as described in Checklist \u00a7 4(1) , below. (b)(1) -(2) Community information & assessing health needs Community served by a hospital facility In defining the community it serves, a hospital facility may take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances, including the geographic area served by the hospital facility, target population(s) served for example, children, women, or the aged), and principal functions (for example, focus on a particular specialty area or targe ted disease). However, a hospital facility may not define its community to exclude medically underserved, low -income, or minority populations who live in the geographic areas from which the hospital facility draws its patients (unless such populations are not part of the hospital facility's target patient population(s) or affected by its principal functions) or otherwise should be included based on the method the hospital facility uses to define its community. In addition, in determining its patient populations for purposes of defining its community, a hospital facility must take into account all patients without regard to whether (or how much) they or their insurers pay for the care received or whether they are eligible for assistance under the hospital f acility's financial assistance policy. In the case of a hospital facility consisting of multiple buildings that operate under a single state license and serve different geographic areas or populations, the community served by the hospital facility is the aggregate of such areas or populations. (b)(3) 2019 -2022 Dignity Health Dominican Hospital CHNA ATTACHMENT 1: IRS CHECKLIST 2 CHNA Requirement Information Required Section Reference CHNA Report Reference/ Comments Assessing community health needs To assess the health needs of the community it serves, a hospital facility must identify significant health needs of the community, prioritize those health needs, and identify resources (such as organizations, facilities, and programs in the community, inc luding those of the hospital facility) potentially available to address those health needs. For these purposes, the health needs of a community include requisites for the improvement or maintenance of health status both in the community at large and in pa rticular parts of the community (such as particular neighborhoods or populations experiencing health disparities). A hospital facility may determine whether a health need is significant based on all of the facts and circumstances present in the communit y it serves. In addition, a hospital facility may use any criteria to prioritize the significant health needs it identifies, including, but not limited to, the burden, scope, severity, or urgency of the health need; the estimated feasibility and effective ness of possible interventions; the health disparities associated with the need; or the importance the community places on addressing the need. (b)(4) Persons representing the community i) A hospital facility must solicit and take into account input received from persons representing the broad interests of the community in identifying and prioritizing significant health needs, including all of the following sources and in identifying resources potentially available to address those health needs: (b)(5)(i) At least one state, local, tribal, or regional governmental public health department (or equivalent department or agency), or a State Office of Rural Health, with knowledge, information, or expertise relevant to the health needs of that community. (b)(5)(i)(A) (i) (B) Members of medically underserved, low -income, and minority populations in the community served by the hospital facility, or individuals or organizations serving or representing the interests of such populations.
