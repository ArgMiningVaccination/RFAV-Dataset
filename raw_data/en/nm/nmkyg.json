Called [Sva](https://www.svawell.com) \u2014 derived from svasthya, Sanskrit for the universal wisdom of staying true to one's own self \u2014 the new range of holistic formulas and supplements is testament of the firm's dedication in providing well-rounded health, both mentally and physically, to guests and fans of its lauded spa treatments. In keeping with this promise of quality well-being, all products from Sva are made from high quality all-natural ingredients, and come in granule, capsule, or tonic form to help [support digestion](https://www.lifestyleasia.com/sg/living/wellness/kombucha-trend-to-staple-health-drink/), blood circulation and a healthy mind. The 19 products draw from the brand's expertise in both traditional know-how with contemporary science and nutrition findings, and are branched into three ranges: Chinese Herbal Formulas, Micronutrient Supplements, and Botanical Tonics (the latter of which will launch later this year). The [gluten-free](https://www.lifestyleasia.com/sg/food-drink/dining/gluten-free-restaurants-singapore/), [plant-based products](https://www.lifestyleasia.com/sg/living/wellness/your-complete-guide-to-plant-based-milk-alternatives/) have been designed to be easily integrated into anyone's daily routine, and aim to be a defence against daily and seasonal stressors. The brand's hero formula, the Respiratory Support, for example, was developed specifically to boost the respiratory system, especially during cold or flu season. Six other formulas borrow from [ancient Chinese remedies](https://www.lifestyleasia.com/sg/living/wellness/superfood-spotlight-goji-berries-asian-superfood/) to fortify various parts of the body, such as Nourish for the digestive system, and Immune Support, which rebalances the immune system. Each formula has been carefully concocted from ingredients that have become an integral part of Aman's wellness philosophy over the years, such as jujube red dates and Chinese licorice. On the other hand, the Sva Micronutrient Supplements were created in partnership with [Biogena](https://www.biogena.com/en-GB/index.html) to provide [essential vitamins and nutrients](https://www.lifestyleasia.com/sg/living/wellness/superfoods-to-eat-for-clearer-complexion-and-glowing-skin/) in a capsule form to help support everyday mind and body functions. If you're still into pulling wild all-nighters, supplements like the Liver Detox have been blended to support the liver's natural detoxifying function. Relax & Sleep focuses on [keeping anxiety at bay](https://www.lifestyleasia.com/sg/living/wellness/foods-that-fight-anxiety-and-stress/), while Heart & Brain Function ensures you're always at the top of your game mentally. The Sva products continue Aman's penchant for understated style by being discreetly packaged in sustainable glass bottles with a subtle yet sleek monochrome design. The Chinese Herbal Formulas and Micronutrient Supplements are available online now at [shop.aman.com](https://shop.aman.com/en/product-category/supplements/) and will be available at select Aman Spas.
