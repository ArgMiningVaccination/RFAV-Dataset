Give your skin a treat: soothe your face with high-quality facial cleansers and toners, massage natural body oils into your skin, and smother luscious body butter all over. Keep your skin happy. Whether it's your simple daily skincare routine or a full-on pampering session, make sure you use clean, natural beauty products for the best results. Nature provides us with natural produce that's perfect for everyday skin care. When your shower gel, body scrub, body lotion and facial cream are enriched with rich, organic ingredients instead of harsh chemicals, your skin will really feel the difference. Especially if you have dry or sensitive skin. What is clean, natural beauty? Jojoba oil, [rosehip oil](/shop/natural-beauty/skincare/shop/product/trilogy-certified-organic-rosehip-oil-60076391), coconut flakes, dead sea minerals, Manuka honey, snail gel, turmeric, almond...the list of natural ingredients that your skin loves could go on and on. So, it astounds us here at Holland & Barrett that harsh chemicals even come into the equation when it comes to skincare. Show all of your skin some love Don't let your face hog all the attention - the rest of your body deserves to be pampered too. Scrub up well: Exfoliation is important when it comes to skincare, especially if you shave. It removes dead skin cells, allows body creams to moisturise your body better, and generally improves the look and feel of your skin. Let it all soak in: For everyday moisturising, rub firming body lotion, body cream for dry skin or deliciously thick body butter into your skin after a nice shower or bath. If you want to really treat yourself, opt for coconut oil, rosehip oil or Moroccan argan oil to give your skin a deeply moisturising bit of luxury. Don't forget the feet: our tootsies sometimes take the toll of a busy life, with calluses and rough bits being a common occurrence. Look after them with softening foot cream and oils like peppermint. The thought of rubbing synthetic chemicals all over our faces and bodies seems a bit scary, but the fact is that many beauty products have you doing just that. Take SLS for example. Sodium lauryl sulphate is the chemical that makes products foam up, like shampoo and face wash. However, a natural alternative is glucosides, which is derived from sugar and is much kinder to your skin. Choose natural body scrubs and body polishes with organic, exfoliating ingredients like sea salt and coconut instead. Whether you have normal, dry, oily, sensitive or combination skin, there are a few basics you should follow to keep your face looking fresh. Step 1: Wash your face morning and night with warm water - water that's too hot can strip the moisture from your skin. Use a cleanser that suits your skin: dry skin likes gentle cleansers enriched with ingredients like [vitamin E oil](https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/shop/natural-beauty/skincare/shop/product/dr-organic-vitamin-e-pure-oil-complex-60083566?skuid=083566/); oily skin likes light, balancing face cleansers; sensitive skin likes facial cleansers with biotin and aloe vera; and normal skin is easy and will like most gentle skin cleansers you put on it. Pro tip: Use upward, massaging motions to help delay wrinkles. Wash the cleanser off with a fresh flannel and apply an alcohol-free face toner. Step 2: Choose a face moisturiser that suits your skin type and massage into your face in the morning before you apply any makeup products - leave the face cream on for at least five minutes. Pro tip: Apply night cream too for super soft skin, and never leave your makeup on overnight! Step 3: Always wear sun protection, even when it's not so sunny. Choose SPF15 as your bare minimum to protect yourself from harmful and aging UV rays. You don't necessarily have to use traditional sun cream on your face, just choose a BB cream or foundation with SPF inside. Holland & Barrett have a sun cream range that is made of 100% minerals, is reef-safe and totally vegan friendly - check it out Step 4: Water, water and more water! Make sure you drink water throughout the day to keep your skin looking healthy and hydrated. "}
