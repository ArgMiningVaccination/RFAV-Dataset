The health of your blood is closely connected with your body's immune system and ability to fight infections. Blood provides your body's cells with oxygen and nutrition and removes waste and other unnecessary pollutants. Therefore, purifying your blood is important to keep your body functioning properly and help prevent infections and diseases. Generally, keeping your liver and kidneys in good health are the best ways to cleanse your blood naturally. Your liver and kidneys perform vital functions in filtering toxins from the blood and keeping your blood clean. However, your intestines, lungs, and skin are also involved in eliminating waste products from your blood so it's important to keep them healthy to help building a stronger, healthier blood. There are many factors which can cause a buildup of toxins in our bloodstream. For example, being exposed to more pollutants in the air, having a sedentary lifestyle, eating processed foods, taking certain medications, and using certain cosmetics and household products can all influence the health of your blood. You can help remove and flush out toxins from your blood by eating the right kind of foods and herbs. In this article, I will look at the importance of detoxifying and purifying your blood. You will also learn which are the best foods and herbs to cleanse your blood naturally and help to build stronger and healthier blood. Blood and Your Health Blood is made up of 4 main components: plasma, red blood cells, [white blood cells](https://www.healthyandnaturalworld.com/high-white-blood-cell-count-wbc/), and platelets. According to Dr. Matthew Hoffman on WebMD, plasma makes up about half of your blood volume. Plasma contains blood clotting proteins, glucose, and other nutrients.1 [Making sure that you have healthy circulation](https://www.healthyandnaturalworld.com/improve-blood-circulation-naturally/) helps to transport oxygen-carrying red blood cells to the body's tissues. Dr. Judith Berry from The University of Rochester says that red blood cells are involved in removing carbon dioxide from the body.2 The University of Rochester also says that white blood cells, also called [leukocytes](https://www.healthyandnaturalworld.com/leukocytes-in-urine-stool/), contain components that fight infections and are essential for good health. Inflammation in your body, physical or emotional stress and injury can all trigger an increase in white blood cell count.3 So, keeping your blood clean and healthy is important to enjoy good health and helps to prevent some diseases developing. The Importance of Blood Cleansing Purifying the blood naturally through the body's own cleansing system helps you fight bacterial, viral, and fungal infections more effectively. The two main organs involved in cleansing toxins and pollutants from the blood are the liver and kidneys. According to PubMed Health, your liver helps to break down foods so that we get the proper nutrients from them. The liver also detoxifies and removes harmful substances from the blood where they get flushed out in urine or get released in the bowel.4 Your kidneys also play an important role in cleansing your blood from harmful toxins. For example, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases says that the kidneys prevent a buildup of waste and fluid in the body. They filter out waste products and help to detoxify and purify the blood.5 The Best Foods and Herbs to Cleanse Your Blood There are many foods and herbs that help your liver and kidneys to function better so that they filter out toxins and keep your blood clean.

Lemon [Consuming lemon water](https://www.healthyandnaturalworld.com/health-benefits-of-drinking-honey-lemon-water/) is another great way to cleanse your blood and detoxify your liver.

Therefore the liver's efficiency gets a boost from lemon consumption.31 Lemons also contain large amount of toxin-eradicating vitamin C. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant which is needed to manufacture glutathione.32 Glutathione is one of the [most powerful antioxidants in your body](https://www.healthyandnaturalworld.com/best-natural-antioxidant-you-didnt-know-exists/).

Then your liver gets overloaded and damaged, making it unable to do its job of detoxification. Lemons, like other citrus fruits, contain a compound called hesperidin. This compound was found to have protective properties in an Indian research study published in the BMC Pharmacology journal in 2005. During the study, the participants were given a toxin after being given the hesperidin compound. It was found that their livers took less damage than they would have had they not been administered hesperidin, making a powerful argument for the liver-protecting properties of lemon. The authors concluded that hesperidin demonstrates a protective effect on the liver.33 17. Water To keep your blood healthy and free of toxins, it's essential that you drink plenty of water.
