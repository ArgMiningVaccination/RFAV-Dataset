This up-to-date resource also incorporates emerging fields of science and significant discoveries. With contributions from leading experts of international repute in their respective fields, the book first emphasizes the important role nutrition plays not only in the prevention of liver disease but also in the reversal of liver dysfunction. The second section covers various aspects of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as well as the consequent steatohepatitis that encompasses the whole spectrum of triglyceride accumulation, inflammation, fibrosis, and end-stage cirrhosis of the liver. The book then focuses on the mounting evidence in support of alcohol abuse, hepatitis viruses, and immune diseases as key predisposing factors in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas. The final section evaluates the importance of nutrition in the treatment of liver diseases in infants versus adults, including recovery after liver transplantation.
