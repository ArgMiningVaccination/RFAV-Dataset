Advancements in modern technology have created ways to safely treat wastewater to remove waste and generate clean water that can be put back into waterways. Crystal Clean's wastewater treatment facilities specialize in handling and treating non-hazardous liquid wastewater and non-hazardous solid waste streams. Crystal Clean operates several state-of-the-art wastewater treatment facilities throughout North America to ensure cost-effective, environmentally sound disposal and treatment of wastewaters. Wastewaters are processed through our treatment system to remove oils, solids, and other contaminants, leaving clean water for discharge. The clean water is discharged to a publicly owned treatment works (POTW) to be further treated and discharged. Separated oils are sent to Crystal Clean's used oil re-refinery and consolidated, stabilized solids are sent to a properly permitted, secure landfill for disposal. Our state-of-the-art facilities are permitted to treat multiple categories of waste. Treatment Options Include: - EPA Subcategory A - Metals - EPA Subcategory B - Used Oils - EPA Subcategory C - Organics - EPA Subcategory D - Mixed - Non-RCRA Liquids and Semisolids - Non-Hazardous Solidification - Oily Waters Treatment - Petroleum Recycling Wastewater Treatment Process Collection Professional Crystal Clean representatives collect waste waters from generators which are then transported to a regional waste water treatment facility. Coagulation The waste water is sent through an oil/water separator and a coagulation agent is introduced, causing contaminates such as oils, heavy metals and low-level organics to gather and settle at the bottom of the waste water tank. Precipitation The gathered contaminates are transformed into a solid state using a solidification or chemical binding agent and then removed from the waste water. Adjustments The waste water is tested and treated to adjust it to a neutral pH level so that it is safe for the environment and for consumption. Discharge The treated water is sent to a POTW (publicly owned treatment works), where it goes through additional treatment and is then discharged into public waterways. Relevant Services Waste collected from the following services have the ability to be disposed using Crystal Clean's wastewater treatment capabilities. "}
