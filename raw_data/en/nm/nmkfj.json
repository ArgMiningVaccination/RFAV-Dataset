Of these, about 600,000 give birth.Pregnancy during adolescence has special risks because a young female is still growing before age 20. Teenagemothers are more likely than other age groups to have low birth-weight babies who, in turn, have a high mortality rate(Merki & Merki, 1994).Adolescent pregnancy is a national problem that affects every income and ethnic group in the country. Although the fearof AIDS has changed the sexual behavior of many Americans, more teenagers than ever are sexually active. Accordingto the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC), 51.5% of girls ages fifteen to nineteen engaged in premarital sex in 1988and 29% used no contraception. For boys ages fifteen to nineteen, the rate was 60% (Seltzer, 1991).Pregnancy is a leading reason high school girls drop out of school. The physical, social, and economic consequencesof teenage mothers and their babies are severe.Teen parents often experience serious educational, vocational, and financial problems. The Center for PopulationOptions states that one in three families started by teens ends up on public assistance; of parents who are not highschool graduates, 39% live in poverty. The issues surrounding early parenthood apply to both girls and boys. If ateenage boy becomes a father, he may need to drop out of school to help support his child. Generally, adolescents whodo not complete their education, find it extremely difficult to support themselves. Thus, a cycle of dependence may beestablishedone of depending on parents or relatives, or on public assistance (Life Planning Education, 1989).Teens often fail to recognize the reality of parenthood. They may have limited experience with child care; two hours ofbabysitting does not prepare them for the twenty-four hour job of parenting. They may have unrealistic ideas aboutcosts associated with being a parent. Most importantly, they may have succumbed to the myth of the \"Gerber baby\" thatis perpetuated by television shows and commercials that always present a healthy, smiling infant to the viewer (LifePlanning Education, 1989).It has been estimated that three-quarters of all teen pregnancies in this country are unplanned (Merki & Merki, 1994).This can be due to being unknowledgable, careless, or by taking risks.The United States is in the midst of an epidemic in which millions of people a year are infected by sexually transmitteddiseases: many are teenagers.STCs are spread primarily by close sexual contact and sexual intercourse. There are many different types of STDs,ranging from pubic lice, which although annoying is relatively benign, to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS),which is invariably fatal (Growing Up Caring, 1987). The most prevalent STD in the U.S. today is chlamydia whichinfects approximately one in every thirteen sexually active women under the age of twenty-five. Genital warts may affectas many as 40% of all teenage girls (Seltzer, 1991).Teenagers often feel invulnerable and immortal when it comes to AIDS. The numbers of teenage AIDS patients infectedthrough heterosexual intercourse nearly doubled in 1990. Although heterosexual sex accounts for only 5% of the totalnumber of AIDS cases, it is responsible for 14% of all teenage cases. Only 10% of all AIDS patients are female, but inthe teenage population, 25% are female (Seltzer, 1991).Sexual activity has consequences, and these must be considered ahead of time. Many young people believe thatadvance planning interferes with spontaneity, the free expression of love and affection, and that this is somehow wrong.But NOT planning in advance is irresponsible and unfair to oneself and to others (Growing Up Caring, 1987). 4LG 4Teen Pregnancy 0.111.111.11.111.131111.111.3.135121.0.13.131.110 11 1 I 1 1 1 1jaPredict the Consequences for Self, Partner, and Families in Case ofw Pregnancy.Student OutcomesIdentify problems that a teen couldface if she became pregnant.Identify problems affectingparent(s) of teens in case ofteenage pregnancy.Definitioncostsgiving up something for something else Identify costs associated with teenage pregnancy. Key Ideas.Parenthood requires responsibility, commitment, maturity, and sacrifice. The reali.:as of parenthood are often overlookedby teens.Teenage parenting changes a teen's responsibilities and obligations. It makes it difficult to finish school, harder to copewith the demands of child care, and it limits a teen's future opportunities.Parenthood can be very rewarding when teenagers are ready to face up to the responsibilities of parenting. Teenagersneed to be prepared emotionally, financially, and intellectually to raise a child.The impact of teenage pregnancy affects not only the teens, but also one or both of their parents. Teenage parentsgenerally face more problems than older parents. Some of these problems are as follows:babies being born with health problemsdropping out of schooldifficulty finding a jobbecoming dependent on welfare (Life Planning Education, 1989)Teenage pregnancy may affect one or both sets of parents of the teen(s). The parents may have to assist the teen(s) physically and financially.alter their future plans to help the teenage parent(s).let the teenager(s) live with them until the financial stress is eased.be left with the total support of the grandchild if their child refuses to assume that responsibility. Parenting involves many issues including time, money, health, energy, change in social lifestyle, emotional well-being,and intellectual and career development. When parents are ready for the responsibilities of raising children, they usuallyare willing to make sacrifices. When parents are too young or not ready to take on the responsibility and makesacrifices for their children, the cost may be too high (Parenting Education,1990). 61.011301311111111..1D121013.1311)8 LG 4Teen PregnancyComp 1: Consequences 5 Teacher Strategies/Methods1. Assess how a teen would feel about being a parent. (See Supr ment 1.)2. Discuss the intentions of the teenager regarding parenting. The following questions may give clues as to thereadiness of the teen tojaarent:How would you feel about assuming the responsibility for the care of a child?How will you acquire the necessary skills for being a parent?Are you ready to change your lifestyle for a child?3. Discuss the future plans of the teenager. (This can give the teen some clues to the consequences of parenting.)Ask questions such asWhat are the top five priorities in your life?What are your plans for the future? (e.g., education, career)How would having a child alter these plans?(These may also be asked of those who already are parents.)4. Discuss with the students problems that teen parents often face (e.g., babies have health problems; teen drops outof school).5. Emphasize the special problems that occur when teensbecome pregnant before they are prepared for parenting.-..1:- -...-- ---17:7:-.. 7'--:TZ.---\"..s.-........-----...------z----:-..--:*:-.-----;---,----------_-::--=-_---- -=\"-----_..,........._ Discuss the consequences to the teen mother, teen father, --....the baby, and others.6. Identify the risks associated with teenage pregnancy suchas health risks, socioeconomic risks (e.g., pressure tomarry or difficulty finding a job), and emotional risks.7. Discuss impacts of teen pregnancy on the partner and/orthe responsibility to the child. Consider discussing thepossibility of marriage and the pros and cons for thecouple and child.8. Clarify some of the emotional risks and decisions involvedwith teenage pregnancy such as whether to terminate thepregnancy, to put the baby up for adoption, or to decide tokeep the baby.9. Stress the costs involved in being a teen parent (seeDefinition for clarification of costs). Use Supplement 2,\"Parenting Costs,\" to lead discussion. Also, consider costof pregnancy, birth, and health care for an infant.10. Help students recognize some of the effects of teenpregnancy on the parent(s) of the teen(s) (e.g., physical,financial, future living arrangements, andresponsibility). 6LG 4Teen PregnancyComp 1: Consequences 411.02.13,13.13.13.11.32.13.121.12.131.0 11. Discuss with students the changes that take place in a home after the baby arrives (e.g., lack of sleep; giving muchtime to the baby).12. List possible expenses for having and raising a child (pregnancy and birth to age eighteen). Make this listaccessible to students, incorporate it into a discussion, or have students devise the list as an activity.13. Invite a resource person or parent to present information on the expenses of pregnancy and childbirth and/or raisinga child.14. Emphasize the importance of delaying pregnancy until she/he is ready for the responsibility. Suggested Student Activities1. Using Supplement 3, \"Am I Ready for Parenting,\" identify questions that a person or couple should ask whenconsidering parenthood.2. Using Supplement 4, \"Parenting and Life Plans,\" complete statements ot goals to accomplish. Identify whether eachgoal would be affected by parenthood.3. Identify the costs (something given up for something else) associated with parenting. (Use Supplement 5, \"ChildRearing Task Costs.\") 9(*).4. Identify sacrifices that would need to be made by a parent. Use case situations (see Supplement 6, \"Parenthood:Why and When\") and answer the questions. 9 <X>5. Using Supplement 7, \"Effects a Baby Can Have,\" identify positive and negative effects having a baby could have ineach of the boxed areas. For example: A positive effect in social life is that a baby could lead to making newfriends; a negative effect in social life may be the loss of opportunities to go out and spend time with friends.0 4E>6. Identify some adjustments that must be made once the baby arrives. Categorize the adjustments as to whether theyaffect the mother, the father, or other family members (Ohio Department of Education, 1989). For example:adjusting sleep patterns to coincide with baby's needs could affect the mother, father, and others.7. Identify activities that you as a student do in a day. Identify whether the activities could be completed with a baby.Identify adjustments that would need to be made to get the activities done. (Use Supplement 8, \"The Juggling Act.\") 8. Using Supplement 9, \"Case Studies,\" identify problems associated with each parenting situation. Discuss possiblesolutions to the problems. 99. Find current articles and/or newspaper clippings on the financial cost of raising a child. Consider the cost of morethan one child, the income of parent(s) necessary for raising a child, expenses to the family such as home buyingand school, and unexpected expenses such as illnesses and injuries. An alternate activity could be to interviewparents or others to determine expenses. Ei<30, (20.3111.13.13.0.1111.131.31.DES.12.111.0 LG 4Teen PregnancyComp 1: Consequences 7 Sample AssessmentsKnowledge1. List ten problems that a teen could face if she became pregnant.

Carla is sixteen years old and her child, Sonny, is fourteen months old. She lives with hermother, who cares for Sonny while she attends school and holds down a part-time job as acashier at the local restaurant. When Carla is home, Carla's mother expects Carla to care forSonny and help with other household chores. Carla feels this is unfair because she must alsostudy. She often fails to get the chores completed. She also leaves Sonny in the playpen muchof the time. Carla's mother often nags Carla because Carla is not helping around the house ortaking care of Sonny. Carla and her mother often fight over household tasks and over whetheror not Carla is a good mother. 2.Nicolette is an eighteen-year-old senior with a one-year-old child.

Key IdeasIn order to prevent pregnancy, it isnecessary to understand how thereproductive systems work.Sexual maturity readies the bodiesof girls for motherhood and boys forfatherhood (Adult Sexuality, 1986-1987).A girl can get pregnant before herfirst period (Life Planning Education,1989).A baby may start to grow when asexually capable young woman anda sexually capable young man haveintercourse.Defireproconc fertnitionsductioneption- the process ofproducing or making babies- union of an ovumand a sperm resulting in thebeginning of pregnancy (Brisbane, 1994, p. 599) lization- occurs when oneof the sperm cells from a man ..reaches the female egg cell after it has left awoman's ovary, but before it is discarded by herbody (Family Planning and Contraception, 1986-1987) exualntercourseovulation sperm cells- the joining ofsexual organs - at maturity (around11 or 12), a girl's ovariesbegin to release one egg, or ovum, each monthwhen that process of ovulation begins, so will herability to get pregnant (Family Planning andContraception, 1986-1987)- male reproductivecells; at maturity (around 13or 14), a boy's testicles begin to produce and storesperm cells (Family Planning and Contraception,1986-1987) A girl can get pregnant her first time and every time she has sex. A girl cannot know of one absolutely safe time whenshe cannot get pregnant (Life Planning Education, 1989). 23 20LG 4Teen PregnancyComp 2: Reproduction 431.0.1B.8.13.3.8.1111111.1141.13.11.3.0 Teacher Strategies/Methods1. Emphasize the importance of knowing how one's body works in order to prevent pregnancy.2. Define the term \"reproduction\" (see Definitions) and emphasize the idea that it takes both a woman and a man tocreate a pregnancy.3. Introduce the female reproductive system to the students (Supplement 10). The teacher should trace the egg fromwhere it is made (ovaries), to how it is transported (fallopian tubes), to the uterus or womb (where the egg stays if itis joined with the sperm to grow into a baby). The teacher should stress that in order for pregnancy to occur, asperm cell from the man must join with an egg cell from the woman.4. Introduce the male reproductive system (Supplement 11). Review the system from where sperm are made (testes),how they are transported (vas deferens), and how they leave the man's body (penis).5. Explain that the sperm and egg can join when a man and woman have sexual intercourse (slang: have sex, makelove). Explain the act of sexual intercourse, emphasizing when pregnancy can occur.6. Point out that there are many slang terms related to sexuality that are used by people. People use slang termsbecause they do not know the correct sexual terms or because they may not feel comfortable using them. Correctsexual terms will or should be used and slang is unacceptable (Life Planning Education, 1989).7. Reinforce the fact that because of the frequency at which a woman releases an egg, it is very difficult to know whenthis is happening. Therefore, pregnancy is always possible. Explain what is meant by a woman's fertile time.8. Stress that a man continuously produces sperm and can cause pregnancy at any time.9. Stress that, at sexual maturity, a girl is always capable of getting pregnant, and she can never know of a specifictime that she cannot get pregnant. Discuss and clarify common myths (e.g., sex during menstruation).10. Stress that at sexual maturity, a boy is always capable of getting a girl pregnant. Discuss arid clarify common myths(e.g., number of ejaculations makes no difference).11. Clarify what happens to the egg when it is not joined with a sperm (define as menstrual period). 0.111.131.11.C1.131.8.11.131.131.21.0.Cialli'4 LG 4Teen PregnancyComp 2: Reproduction 21 Suggested Student Activities1.

If no contraception is used, there is no safe time to have sexualintercourse (Lindner, 1987).The best way to make a decision about birth control is to gather information on all methods, decide which best suitsone's values and personal needs, and then, if desired, talk to people about one's choice (Lindner, 1987).There are many methods of birth control. A person should consider the method best for her/him and decide ahead oftime.Men often leave birth control up to the women because men do not get pregnant (Family Planning and Contraception,1986-1987).Abstinence is the only way a woman can be absolutely sure she will not become pregnant.Anyone heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual taking part in sexual or drug-abusing behavior with an infected personcan get the AIDS virus (Lindner, 1987).The AIDS virus is passed through sexual contact, the exchange of blood (including the sharing of drug needles), or froman infected mother to her baby.A person's risk of getting the AIDS virus can be reduced (or eliminated) by doing certain things.Condoms may reduce the risk of catching the AIDS virus, but they are not 100% guaranteed. 0.13.T.8.3.111.111.111.3.31.121.2.13.131.11032 LG 4Teen PregnancyComp 3: Birth Control29 ContraceptivesSome methods of birth control are more effective than others. Some have health risks, some methods ofcontraception require a prescription from a doctor, some methods are available in drugstores without prescription,and some are more convenient and easier to use than others (Lindner, 1987).There are many methods people use as birth control that do not work: Saran Wrap, rather than a condom;standing up during intercourse; douching or washing after intercourse; or intercourse during menstruation.The proper use of condoms can be an effective method of birth control, and can also be effective in preventing thespread of many STDs. STDsA good way to avoid getting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is to avoid having sexual relations with peoplewho have or have had multiple sex partners (Adult Sexuality, 1986-1987).People who think they may have a sexually transmitted disease should not have sexual relations until a doctorsays it is okay (Adult Sexuality, 1986-1987).Syphilis and gonorrhea, referred to as VD (venereal disease), are only two of the many Strategies/Methods1.

It does mean that a person has the responsibility of getting treatmentand giving information to any person(s) with whom th3y may have had S3)( (Growing Up Caring, 1987). If left untreated,STDs.can damage the heart, brain, and reproductive organs, as well as cause blindness, arthritis, pain, and even death(Adult Sexuality, 1986-1987).It is important for a person to know the signs and symptoms of STDs so that she/he can get immediate testing andtreatment by a doctor. Possible symptoms for which a person should see a doctor include fatigue, loss of appetite,persistent cough, vomiting, fever, rashes, sores, discharge from penis or vagina, burning or pain while urinating, anditching in genital area (Adult Sexuality, 1986-1987). Some STDs have no recognizable symptoms.Most STDs must be treated with medication (Lindner, 1987). STDs will not go away unless treated by a doctor. STDsare not contracted every time a person has sex; however; STDs can be contracted more than once (Adult Sexuality,1986-1987). Only a doctor can treat sexually transmitted diseases. Annual physical exams are a good way to detectinfections.AIDS is the most serious of the sexually transmitted diseases. AIDS and genital herpes have no cure. A person cannotdetermine if she/he has the AIDS virus; only a physician can diagnose the condition. There are many myths about howthe AIDS virus is transmitted. The AIDS virus is not spread by casual, social, or family contact (Lindner, 1987).AIDS is transmittedthrough sexual contact.by exchange of blood (needles).from mother to unborn child (Merki, 1993).A person suspecting that she/he has been infected with the virus that causes AIDS can be given an antibody test. Apositive result means that the person has been infected with the HIV and can transmit the virus to others. A positive testresult does not mean that the person has or will oevelop AIDS. Local or state health departments provide confidentialtesting for all persons suspecting AIDS infection (Lindner, 1987). 6113.111.8.13.31.8.111,13.31.21.13.111.13.0 4 4 LG 4Teen PregnancyComp 4; Risks & STDs 41 A person who has been treated for an STD needs to be sure that her/his sexual partner(s) have been treated as well(Life Planning Education, 1989). Partners/spouses who remain faithful help limit the spread of STDs.Before having sexual relations, persons should be checked for STDs through a blood test and a physical exam. Even ifa person has had only one partner, that partner could have contracted the disease previously and infected others. 45 42LG 4Teen PregnancyComp 4: Risks & STDs 1.13.3:1.13.12.131.18.111.131.131,21,13.12.131.100 Teacher Strategies/Methods1.
