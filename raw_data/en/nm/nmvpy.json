Our Patient Reviews I'm very happy with my experience here. I had been turned away by other doctors for my illness. After one visit with a very caring doctor who recommended various supplements. I already feel better physically on a daily basis. I recommend coming here. Colleen C. Our Patient At last! A Dr I can talk to who listens attentively and uses a holistic approach as well. The new office is beautiful and the staff are friendly and helpful. Elizabeth R. Our Patient Dr Ron Shemesh is a very caring & through doctor. His approach is different than other doctors who just see one area of the body. He treats the patient as a whole person. I feel so much better after seeing him.
