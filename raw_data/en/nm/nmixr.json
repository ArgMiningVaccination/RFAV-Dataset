Highgrove and Duchy Home Farm were acquired by His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, Prince Charles, in the early 1980s. Duchy Home Farm is one of the bigger organic farms in the UK, and probably the best-known organic farm in Europe. It sits in gently rolling Gloucestershire countryside, about two hours west of London, on the outskirts of a pretty Cotswold hill town, Tetbury. Home Farm is a Soil Association demonstration farm, and the Prince of Wales allows people from all over the world to visit each year, to see an organic farm at work. These include farmers interested in converting to organics, scientists, academics and even the occasional journalist. I'm Cherry Ripe. On a sunny autumn morning thirty or so of us assemble in the farmyard at Home Farm for a walking tour guided by Prince Charles' farm manager, David Wilson. Also along on the tour were three buyers from two supermarket chains: a couple from Marks & Spencer's, and one from Sainsbury's. A sprightly young Duchess of Norfolk, with her Estate Manager from Arundel in Sussex , two Aussie biodynamic farmers from outside Canberra, a wine publisher and his wife, a professor from a London university, and three of the big guns from the Soil Association, it's Chair, Craig Sams, its Policy Director, Lord Melchert, and our co-host on the tour, the Patrick to whom David Wilson frequently refers, Director of the Soil Association, Patrick Holden. The farm buildings are about 100 metres up a country lane, just off a main road. There's nothing flash about the entrance, no stone pillars or iron gates, just hedges, and two discreet signs: Broadfield Farm and Duchy Home Farm, emblazoned with the Prince of Wales' crest, almost obscured by brambles and a hawthorn hedge. After coffee, we all gather in one of the old farm buildings, which has been converted into a meeting hall. Prince Charles' Farm Manager, David Wilson, sets the scene by pointing out where we are. David Wilson: OK, well a brief introduction. You can see the map in front of us here, this is where we are at the moment. This is Broadfield Farm; Highgrove is down here, the land that's shaded in green is the Duchy Home Farm, and it's about 1100 acres in total, all farmed organically. The land that's shaded in yellow is land owned by five different neighbours that we contract farm and tenant farm for them. And that land is also farmed organically. So we're farming a total of just over 1800 acres. So we started off in 1985 with this little block of land down here to the south. It was probably the worst block of land, in terms of weeds and soil type to start on, but we just thought we'd put some red clover and grass in; it grew very well, and we were rather surprised by that, and I can distinctly remember thinking 'I wonder how this is going to grow without putting any fertilizer on it', because I came from a background that just taught you how to use fertilizers and sprays. And I look back at my old agricultural textbooks, like Milk From Grass which is an ICI publication, Growing Cereals is another one, by Bayer, the influence was, and still is, very, very powerful in terms of how it affects our thinking. Cherry Ripe: David Wilson, whose training at agricultural college promoted the use of agrichemicals in farming, was initially sceptical as to whether farming organically was viable, or even possible. The Cotswolds, with its relatively poor, stony soils, was traditionally a sheep and wheatgrowing area. David Wilson found himself on a dramatic learning curve. David Wilson: So it was for me, the beginning of my eyes being opened I suppose. The following year the clover grew very well again, and we thought, 'Well, actually maybe we're on to something here'. We were able to graze it with lambs, and they seemed to perform very well on it. We also then planted wheat, and again, that grew very well. So we started to overcome what I regard is the biggest hurdle to anybody who's, if you like, sitting on the conventional side of the fence, and that is the hurdle of confidence. We have 180 dairy cows that we'll be looking at shortly, Ayrshire dairy cows, we have 100 suckler cows, single suckled, Aberdeen Angus mainly, but also a number of rare breeds, and again that's something we'll talk about as we go around. The Prince of Wales is Patron of the Rare Breed Survival Trust, and the whole subject of gene preservation is very important. We are now dependent on fewer genes than ever for our food, which leaves us in a very vulnerable position, but nobody seems to realise it. But the multinational shapes everything that we grow and everything that we breed, and it's getting extremely narrow, worryingly narrow. And in some cases, where we're losing the genetics, it's almost irreversible. So it's something that we really do need to be aware of. It's actually very simple when you start to understand it, but most people haven't even begun to think about it. It's something that everybody, every consumer needs to be aware of, I think. So that's dairy, beef; we have 500 breeding ewes, so we're producing fat lambs; wool is almost a waste product now, it just about covers the cost of shearing, but there is an embryonic organic wool market that I hope will be developed. Organic fibres generally are beginning to become established. It's a nice sustainable fabric. And we have a few rare breed pigs. So that's the livestock side of things. The key to everything we're doing is the rotation. We have a seven-year rotation, three is clover and grass, where we're building nitrogen and increasing the fertility, followed by four arable crops. The first one will be wheat, followed by oats, then beans, and either rye or barley. Rotations were what enabled us to grow crops in the past, and I think will probably be one of the only ways of growing crops in the future. Clover is an amazing crop. It was something that as soon as I started growing this red clover when I first came here, I thought 'My gosh, we normally would spend 45-pounds, 50-pounds on fertilizer, and that was twenty years ago, to get a crop. And there we are, getting this crop absolutely free, because it fixes atmospheric nitrogen, it's very simple. And that actually is interesting now, because if you look at the price of fertilizer, because gas prices are going up, and the whole fossil fuel issue, it's really going to become something that everybody's going to have to look at. So it's the beginnings, if you like, of that almost essential change of sustainability. If we want to survive, we're going to have to think along those lines, and it is beginning to happen, but it is very slow, and people are very backward looking. So the other thing that we have is 50 acres of veg. We're going to have a look at some of those as we go around. We well some veg through a box scheme, and we then grow more a field scale, potatoes and carrots. Again, I know we've got supermarket representatives here, we do get infuriated with supermarkets, but we're sensible enough to realise that the only way forward really is with the supermarkets. There's plenty of other alternative ways like our box scheme, of marketing produce, but most people still shop in supermarkets, and that's not suddenly going to change. We were selling potatoes to the supermarkets and became infuriated with this whole business of out-grades, the outrage of out-grades I like to call it. In the UK, in overall terms, we throw out, we don't consume over half of what is grown. So between the field and our fridges, over half of it is actually thrown away. And a lot of that can occur at the out-grade stage. So for us with potatoes, you can never get the perfect skin, and it would mean that you'd get 30% or even 40% out-grades. So we reduced the acreage until we were selling all of the potatoes we could locally; we've now got a market with South Gloucestershire County Council where we're selling to the schools, we've started to expand again now. The same with carrots. Patrick and I are both very keen carrot growers, and we have this whole problem with out-graded carrots, and there's an awful lot of work that goes into growing carrots organically, and you do end up with a wonderful vegetable, but because the thing isn't absolutely straight, doesn't mean it's inedible, it may even make it easier to eat, you don't know. Apparently it's a huge issue, and you look at the spec sheet for a carrot, I mean it's just ludicrous, and yet we all seem to accept it. Patrick's doing a great thing now where he's actually selling all of his carrots, bar the genuinely manky ones, so you grade out maybe a couple of percent, which can then be fed back to your livestock. He's selling 'as dug', and bearing in mind we cut most of them up before we eat them anyway, I think it's the right way to go, and explains why on his bag. And I think in some ways, people would almost expect that from organics. I've yet to meet anybody who says, 'Can't touch that carrot. Curved. This guy's got a bit of a ripple half-way down, and oh, I might gag on that.' Perhaps it's a suing issue, I don't know. So it is quite ludicrous, and the thing that actually gave us the initiative with the school was the fact that we had carrots back here, if you sent off twenty tons and you could quite easily end up with six or seven tons tipped up on the concrete ready to feed back to the dairy cows, so at least it sort of helped placate us and our bitter feelings towards the supermarkets and not having to waste them. Cherry Ripe: David Wilson is the Farm Manager of Duchy Home Farm, the Prince of Wales' organic farm at Highgrove in Gloucestershire. In the UK, 70% of people shop at supermarkets on only two criteria: convenience and price. A survey conducted in the UK last year showed that seven years ago, a food basket containing 30 items cost 37-pounds-70, that's about $A94.00. Seven years later, the cost of those same items was actually about $1 less. But as one farmer on the tour pointed out, while costs of production are going up and up, supermarkets are paying farmers less and less, and as a result, farmers are going broke. About 75% of organic food production and processing in the UK is certified by the Soil Association. It's Director, Patrick Holden, was a major influence on the Prince of Wales embracing organic farming twenty years ago. Holden is still a frequent visitor to Highgrove, co-hosting educational tours such as the one we're on today. Patrick Holden: The whole country could be farmed like this, and if this farm was just an arable farm, you'd probably have just one person working here, or maybe two at the most. And the landscape would look very, very different, because there would be no grass and there would be no livestock. And Rudolf Steiner described livestock as the soul of a landscape. But if you add people, and animals, and a diversity of crops, you get the sort of landscape that used to be the whole of Britain, and now is quite confined to just some - well actually mainly organic farms, because when you introduce organic farming, because of what we said earlier about the rotation, you bring back this diversity of crops and that gives more employment opportunities, and I think that's important to look at. David Wilson: Yes, and the central issue is a really important issue. My neighbours will be one- or two-man farms on probably 1500, 2000 acres, and they've got to get bigger just to maintain a small loss, almost. Most of them probably aren't making any money, and you do see it as something that is going to have to come to an end, because you just can't carry on this way, they're just buying bigger and bigger machinery, and just trying to shave the labour down. Cherry Ripe: David Wilson points out that organic farming is much more heavily reliant on human labour than intensive industrial agriculture. David Wilson: It's labour-intensive in peaks. A mixed farm is much more complicated to run, and you're constantly compromising, because for example, we're lifting carrots today, we're trying to lift potatoes and sort them today, and there's very often something else that needs doing, and it is quite complicated. So as far as the core farm staff go, you want intelligent, practical people that can turn their hand to a number of things. And most farm staff are, I think, very talented people. You know what I mean. And very under-valued I think. As far as casual labour goes, we can get a few local people in, but most people don't really like getting their hands dirty. We do get a gang in for a few days if we just need that input. If we get to a certain stage and you don't get them out, they suddenly become a very big problem, so if you can quickly get on and do it, it's cheaper in the long run. So we use a legal gangmaster, and it's expensive. So we don't have to do it every year, but there are gangs around that will come in. Patrick Holden: In the UK, we now have less than 1% of the population involved in agriculture, whereas in China and India, it's around 60%, and even actually the countries of Eastern Europe, like Roumania, I think it's up about level. And that begs the question, What is the right percentage of a nation's workforce that should be involved in agriculture? And clearly, 1% is ridiculous, it's much too low, but 60%, 70% is probably too high. But if we're going to shift, it means that society as a whole has to put a higher value on food, because otherwise we can't afford to pay people a viable wage, and I think we've also got to make agriculture more attractive culturally to the young. Because ultimately if we can attract the young to choose agriculture as an employment channel for their lives, then we know we're succeeding. And at the moment the average age of a farm worker is something like fifty nine, and still going up. But interestingly enough, we're doing some research on this at the moment, to look at both the numbers of people employed in organic farming, and the age. And it looks as though when people are given the opportunity to work on organic farms, which are diverse, which are culturally interesting and which are not boring, and have a high social status, not a low social status, it starts to reverse the tide. Cherry Ripe: On a gently sloping hillside behind us, the milking cows are making their way up a field, which is their grazing pasture. David Wilson: They're just on their way out, they're a bit late this morning because we've had a routine vet visit, so that's scuppered that. Cherry Ripe: Our group meanders up farm lanes, across pasture, and around stubble fields. Farm Manager, David Wilson, points out the various soil types, the variety of crops, their stage in the rotation cycle, and the often-overlooked benefit of hedgerows. David Wilson: This is actually a red clover lay in its first year. It is rather dry at the moment, so you can't see a huge amount of clover. A week ago it was a field of red flowers, so I'd like you to use your imagination a little bit. But it is a wonderful crop. It was a really key part of my eyes being opened, so to speak. The other thing is that the hedge that's planted here behind us was actually not there in 1989. We planted it in the winter of '89-1990, it was then laid about 11 years later, it's now a proper hedge, and we planted about 23, 24 kilometres of hedge over the last 16 or 17 years, it's something the Prince of Wales is very keen about. It does make the landscape look nicer, but there's also a lot more to a hedge than just the look. We know that it gives us more over wintering of predatory insects, which are very important for us during the summer months; there's a whole host of birds and mammals that really depend on a well-managed hedge for their existence. And also obviously the shelter element. We are now taking animals into fields that had 30, 40 years of corn. If you've got young lambs turned out in April and you get a very strong wind and a lot of rain, you can lose lambs if they don't have adequate shelter. And it's surprising how quickly a hedge becomes really worth something in terms of its ability to slow the air down. Cherry Ripe: Since 2003, subsidies to British farmers are no longer linked to the volume of production. Instead, farmers can earn money for land conservation and other environmental projects, according to the Soil Association's Patrick Holden. Patrick Holden: The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy has put the emphasis on the protection of the environment, in what's been called stewardship. So farmers now get far more money for stewardship of the environment than they do for actually farming or producing food, and the irony is that they end up planting hedges, or doing other environmentally protected things because they're being paid per kilometre of hedge, or whatever it is, and there's nothing wrong with that per se, but it would be so much better if the sustainable farming system created the need for a hedge which then they would get support for planting, rather than this completely artificial situation where all these people who in their minds, the policymakers, have completely disconnected nature from food. So you get people like my great friend Oliver Walston who's a cereal barley baron near Cambridge, who's planted miles and miles of hedge around the edges of his farm in the most difficult fields. So his fields are still enormous, but he's subsidy harvested on stewardship hedge planting, because he doesn't actually need hedges to protect his lands, or because he hasn't got livestock. So what we really need to do is to start to see nature as being intrinsically linked with food production, not separate. Otherwise we're going to get prairies of monoculture and little oases of nature park, and farmers wondering what they're supposed to be doing, whether they're producing a commodity crop in a world market, or they're a park-keeper. But what we really need to do is to recouple the benefits of nature to the buying of food in the consumer mind, so that you would get paid a right price for your food, which would incorporate the environmental work that you do as well. Whereas at the moment we're going down the division thing, where everyone is starting to see nature and food as different, which is complete madness. Cherry Ripe: Craig Sams is the founder of Grey & Black's organic fair trade chocolate, now owned by Cadbury's. He's also the Chair of the Soil Association. Craig Sams: At the moment what's holding down the price of food is the fact that the main four crops, cotton, rice, corn and soybeans in the United States, are all fixed artificially low through their subsidy system. Once that goes as well, then world prices will reflect market prices, and they will go up. And at that stage, probably all the subsidies can relax without farmers going bust. Cherry Ripe: Many people believe erroneously, that farmers have been feather-bedded by subsidies, according to David Wilson. David Wilson: Farmers, even with the subsidies, make a loss. It's not a very healthy business in the first place. And to expect European farmers to be able to produce various commodities at the same sort of cost as someone in Brazil or something, is totally unrealistic. Our land is many times more expensive, and labour, and all the other inputs. So it's been one of those subjects that's been used to hit farmers with I think unjustifiably. And OK, people may be indirectly paying for the subsidy, but actually they're getting cheap food, and you're going to have to pay for it one way or the other. You certainly will, because there won't be any farmers, and I regard myself as a primary food producer. Patrick Holden: If everybody woke up tomorrow morning and decided that from now on they would only buy locally produced, sustainably produced food for preference, and they would only buy further afield if there was a good reason for it, I mean literally, the world would change, and we would completely transform the future of our food and farming. Cherry Ripe: We're approached by a small herd of friendly, curious cows. Their coats are a mixture of roan and white, speckled and brindled, with a smattering of deep roan animals. They're all in immaculate condition, each sporting a collar with a blue identification tag, their bellies heavy with calf. David Wilson: So these will be calving in the next few weeks. The breed is an Ayrshire, so it's not an all black-and-white breed; the reason for that is because the Prince of Wales said he didn't want another black-and-white herd, so we went for a native breed, but actually it's very well suited to organic production, they're very good producers from forage. At the end of the day that is what we should be using our cows to do, to produce milk from grass either in its grazed form or preserved form as hay or silage, and also that's the cheapest way to get your grass. So our cows are producing a pretty humble 5,000 litres, but they do it off a very, very low amount of concentrate feed. Concentrate feed being grain-derived feed. It's quite likely that an intensive herd producing maybe 8,000 or even 10,000 litres will be using 2-1/2 tons of concentrate feed, which is expensive, not just in terms of its actual cost, but in terms of the fossil fuels used to grow it, but it's also detrimental to the animal's health. The early onset of acidosis in a ruminant is something that is beginning to be understood now. It's very unnatural for a ruminant, like a cow or a sheep, to eat a large amount of cereal, a very quickly digestible carbohydrate. It causes a lowering of the pH which really depresses the animal's immune system. So you're going to get other problems, if you like, in terms of their health. It also affects their joints, they often get laminitic type problems with their feet, and so you'll end up with a bigger vet bill. If you allow them to eat mainly bulky forage, which is what they've evolved doing, they will be healthier. We're feeding about 700 kilos of mainly rolled oats to the cows for their concentrate, a little bit of home-grown beans, and that's about it. As a result of that, bills have been more than halved and that's also because we use a lot of homeopathy, which you've been told by very eminent scientists, doesn't work at all. We also use herbal remedies, and we still use antibiotics if we have to. There's no question of us compromising the welfare of the animal, but we only need to use antibiotics very occasionally, and under the Soil Association regulations, you have to, if you use an antibiotic, withhold milk for basically a couple of weeks. So it's an expensive operation to do. But like all of the things within the organic system, you try and have a system in place that minimises these problems. That is the real key, it's the actual system. Cherry Ripe: Farm Manager, David Wilson is asked whether they use dry cow therapy, an antibiotic treatment widely used in Australian dairy herds. David Wilson: We don't use dry cow therapy, no. That's regarded as a prophylactic use, and so we don't use them. Now interestingly, it was one of the areas that worried us when we started, we'd always use dry cow therapy. Dry cow therapy is a very long-acting and very powerful antibiotic that when a cow's dried off, you inject into her udder and it lasts a long time and theoretically reduces her chances of getting dry cow mastitis, which can be a bit of a problem. The incidence of summer mastitis in our dry cows has not changed at all. We may get a case a year, and sometimes we don't, and that has not changed. What is interesting is that there's work that's been done and Genus (Genus Breeding Ltd) did some work that showed quite conclusively, when you dried a cow off, the untreated cow had a much higher level of pathogens in her udder compared to the treated cow. However when it came to calving time, that had completely reversed, and the untreated animal had a much lower level of pathogens. The treated animal had a much higher level of pathogens. And so that really makes the point very, very clearly, and it explains why in a lot of very high yielding herds, often your best cow will calve, and will get a really severe mastitis, and that's because you've upset the balance. So we're not saying antibiotics are a bad thing, but their over-use we know is a bad thing. And we know it's bad not just in veterinary medicine, but it's bad for human medicines. It's a question of moderation and maybe trying to look at these things intelligently. Before we went organic, our vet would come out and ever since I've been in harming, he'd very rarely disappear without leaving 2 bottles of antibiotics. Patrick Holden: And it's now been shown beyond question that the transfer of antibiotic resistance to super bugs, MRSA and all these other bugs, is happening in livestock, in farm animals as well as in misuse, over-use of antibiotics. It's not widely known, but if you drink non-organic milk, you will almost certainly be drinking the milk of a cow that has had this annual dose of long-acting antibiotics in all four quarters, and if that cow has mastitis during her lactation, she'll automatically be treated with antibiotics. So the antibiotic use is getting absolutely everywhere in intensively farmed livestock, and it's not recognised, not so much beef and sheep, but certainly in pigs, poultry and dairy cows. David Wilson: It's fair to say that all milk is very highly tested for antibiotic residues. Whether conventional or organic, there's very little chance of anything measurable slipping through the net, but what we don't know about is these very, very low levels of antibiotics, of hormone-mimicking substances, and their effect on us long-term. We're beginning to see, and we're beginning to suspect, this is the scientific community, I think they're pretty well agreed on that, that there is an effect at levels that are immeasurable. Cherry Ripe: The tour of Highgrove's Home Farm takes up most of the morning, and David Wilson and Patrick Holden field questions from the group about crop and farm animal management. Both emphasise that factory farming which has spread all over the developed world in the last fifty years or so, not only has implications in terms of animal welfare, but as David Wilson believes, is actually bad animal husbandry. David Wilson: Actually a great example of a totally flawed system. If you look at America, beeflot beef, it's all grain fed and it's bad on all counts. It's bad because it's taking a lot of energy to grow that grain, it's feeding an animal with a feed that it hasn't evolved eating, so it therefore makes it unhealthy. The acidosis increases the amounts by 80 times of e-Coli in the gut of the animal. It means that the animals will become ill on that system, so as a result, animals are bred to survive a flawed system. And the other thing is the quality of the fat is inferior, because it's very in the Omega-6, and the Omega-3s are much lower. A pasture-fed beef, the ratio is much more healthy, the actual quality of that fat, and that fat quality is going to be an issue that people are becoming much more aware of in terms of how it affects children, the development of people's brain, well that's a very powerful thing to hook into. That's an important thing. The ratio in which we're eating these two Omega acids, we evolved with at 2:1 or something, it's now something like 20:1, or 15:1. Cherry Ripe: A major issue on the current European political agenda is agricultural subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy. Whereas in 1988, subsidies to farmers accounted for over two-thirds of the entire European Union budget, they've been reduced and now account for just over one-third of its budget. Nevertheless, many, including Patrick Holden, believe that rather than abandon subsidies altogether, the best way forward would be to redirect subsidies, not simply to environmental schemes but in favour of small family farms, organic or otherwise. Patrick Holden: The average size of a dairy herd in France and in Germany today is 36 cows, and the average size of a dairy herd here is 110 cows. Well this was even bigger, originally, but the trend is going towards 500 cow herds, industrial dairy herds, that will probably give 10,000 litres a cow per lactation, and be fed with high levels of concentrates and just pushed to their limit. I think we need to think as a society as a whole as to what kind of dairy herd we'd like to drink the milk from; would we rather drink the milk from a dairy herd run by a family which gives us this herd gives 5,000 with a native breed, or are we happy to drink milk from cows that give 10,000, 12,000 litres up to that level, milk themselves to death in two or three lactations, and frankly, are in units so large that milking them is like working in a factory. And that's not just some sort of nightmare vision of the future, it's what increasingly the surviving dairy farms are doing, so it's with us actually now. But this debate isn't public. And I think we need to think about those issues. Cherry Ripe: A number of years a dairy cow produces milk after she's had her first calf at the age of two, is measured in lactations. Three decades ago in England, the number of lactations of the average cow was around 9, meaning the cow would produce calves and milk until she was 11 years old. Australian cows average between 4 and 5 lactations, meaning that they live to between 6 and 7 years old. At Highgrove, their cows average 7 lactations, which means that their cows live to be 9 years old, a lifespan more than three times the national UK average. David Wilson: 2.7 lactations is the average number of lactations, and the lactation's about a year, so the cow calves at 2, as a heifer, and then she won't produce her third calf, because she's scrapped, because she's over-producing. In America it's 1.6, and the reason that they have to be thrown out is because they're genetically programmed to produce far more milk than their body can maintain adequate health to do. They are literally milking themselves to death, and you can't blame the farmers for doing that. The reason for doing that is because we have low commodity prices, below the cost of production, so the farmers is trying to up his production always to get just above that little line of profitability. And it's one of the facts, we need to have low commodity prices, it increases over-production, which further reduces commodity prices. And back to Patrick's issue about the social implications of big herds, you start to lose the one-man-and-his-cows, whether it's the farmer or the herdsman, you lose that very vital relationship, and you start ending up with cheap labour, if you look at America, the Mexican migrant workers have just put clusters on cows in herds of many thousands, and it is like a factory, there's no interest in the animal, there's a distant sort of manager figure who oversees the thing; you lose that vital relationship, and I think you start to lose an awful lot more than that. There is I think a sort of maximum size. But once again, the market dictates, and the only way a conventional can make the slightest bit of money, is to have a huge herd. Plus the fact on these big-scale things, you start to have a massive slurry problem, which is a big environmental problem to deal with. You know, you have a small town's worth of muck to get rid of, and that is a big issue in itself. Cherry Ripe: Our group has moved from a field of pasture to a stony hillside of stubble of recently-harvested wheat, cunningly under-planted with another crop of winter fodder. David Wilson: This is just a stubble field that's been cultivated and what you can see emerging is volunteer cereals that's the grassy bit, but the broad leaf there is a mixture of stubble turnips and mustard, and turnips that will be grazed with the sheep over the winter. So it's nothing new, but it's called catch cropping. It will get up to probably this high, it will provide green cover, fodder for the sheep, but also it covers the ground, mops up any residual nitrogen, and nitrogen's very mobile in the soil, but it's very valuable to us because we can't go and top it up with a bag of ammonium nitrate. It's what was fixed there and has been slowly released from the clover that was growing in this field three years ago. And so it will keep the nitrogen stable in the soil until the spring. But it doesn't look very impressive at the moment because a) it's been dry, and b) it's not been in the ground for very long. But we try and cover all of the arable fields with a catch crop. And we're just going to walk round here, there's all new hedges that we ... Cherry Ripe: Led by David Wilson, we stroll up a farm lane, bordered on one side by woodland, and on the other by another field of stubble. At the end of the lane, on the far side of the wood, we're confronted with a dramatic landscape, a field totally carpeted in brilliant yellow flowers, knee high, swaying in the breeze. David Wilson: The crop behind us is mustard. This is a green manure mustard, so believe it or not this was planted five weeks ago tomorrow. And it just roars up out of the ground and flowers. And what we will do with this in about 3, 4 weeks time, is we'll just chop it up and plough it under, and we'll plant rye. We will get the best crop of rye after the mustard, it's just one of those phenomenal crops. Again, it's nothing new. Our forefathers used green manures, and it's something I think I remember I wrote about one line on in my first-year college notes: 'Green manures, they can be a useful thing to do', or something, you know. But that was about it. But it is phenomenal. It has a number of benefits. Because it's very quick-growing and very competitive, it totally dominates the ground, so it stops the weeds doing anything beneath them. It also pulls up nutrients from the sub-soil, which are then released when you chop them back in to the plough deck, if you like. It also has a sort of soil sterilising effect, the mustardy bits, the hot bits. If you nibble a little bit of that leaf, it's very sort of spicy and, well, mustardy. That actually has an effect on certain soil pathogens, so it has a sort of soil sterilising effect, in fact the potatoes that we grew this year, I put down the good yield not just down to well-composted manure, but to the mustard that was in there beforehand that we chopped up and incorporated into the soil. So it's a wonderful crop. The other great thing to see which unfortunately you can't see it gets full of insects, and then the swallows come in and just - you often end up with this crop absolutely full of swallows, particularly the young swallows circulating around picking up the insects, and putting on a lot of food storage, a lot of fat, before they go back to Africa, and it's always nice to see that. Cherry Ripe: In 1990, the Prince of Wales, unable to find a market which gave appropriate value for the crops he was growing organically, set up his own brand of food product, Duchy Originals. The first was an oaten biscuit, initially created from wheat grown here at Home Farm at Highgrove. In the 16 years since, the Duchy Originals range has grown now to include nearly 200 products, and turns over just under $A135-million annually, all profit from which go to charity. Ingredients are now sourced from many other farms, and the range includes bacons, hams, Christmas turkeys, chocolate, flavoured waters, as well as the tricolour root vegetable crisps which incorporate the carrots which we're watching from a distance being mechanically harvested. David Wilson: The carrots are being harvested for OFF, Organic Farm Foods, which is a pack house that deals with the supermarkets, so these will go up and be graded and there will be quite a lot of out-grades, although I've been told that they are a little more lenient this year, and some of the outgrades will go back to the schools, and also the over-sized ones will go back to Duchy Originals to be made into crisps, along with the beetroot and parsnip. So it's a mixed veg crisp. The machine there is called a top-lifter, and it's actually the easiest way to lift carrots at this time of year. The soil is relatively dry, it pulls them up by their leaves after undercutting them with a shear, and the leaves are taken off by some knives at the top. They go into a bunker and it's a one man operation, so it's much easier than pulling them up by hand, I can tell you; we've tried the hard way. And the real problem is just being able to shift enough volume in time. Now these will be in a cold store by about 5 o'clock today, and so the quality will be preserved. If you try to get them up by hand, unless you've got a very large gang, it takes you three or four days to get the same amount up. In warm weather, they dehydrate, and the quality drops. This is actually the smallest area of carrots we've grown for about five years now, purely because I'd wanted to make sure we harvested everything, that we can deal with everything, and that we can deal with everything, and that we're not ending up with loads left in the ground when the weather turns, and we can't use this machine any longer. Cherry Ripe: It's dead clever. David Wilson: Actually when you look at it, it's not that clever, but it's like a lot of these things, it is an example of modern technology which we embrace. You know, there's a lot of myths around organic farmers that we're not happy using any sorts of machine or anything like that, or any modern developments. It's really a question of trying to identify what is the best technology, what is the most appropriate technology, and we certainly would not say all technology's bad. So this field last year was wheat, the rest of the field was oats this year, these are carrots, and this will probably go into beans in the spring. So it's midway on the arable rotation. Cherry Ripe: As if to demonstrate that modernity and organic farming have to coexist, over the fence in the next field is a flock of sheep contentedly grazing, under huge electricity pylons. Amongst them is one black sheep. David Wilson: Lleyns. Yes the lleyn sheep is a breed from Wales, from the Lleyn Peninsula, it's where it originally started, and the reason we're keeping the lleyn now is because we can breed them pure and therefore breed our replacements. In the UK there's a lot of purchasing of the mule, the north-country mule, which is a crossbred sheep which comes from the Upland and Hill areas of Northern England, but it means that every time you're buying in females, you buy them from the North of England, you don't quite know what you're buying in terms of disease, and by breeding our own replacements, we haven't got that risk. Also under the Organic Directive, you're not allowed to buy in non-organic breeding stock, and it's very difficult to get hold of organic mules, so those are the factors that made us really select this breed, which we are delighted with, I have to say. Cherry Ripe: Aren't both Ayrshire cattle and Lleyn sheep No, they're not, they're not endangered; Lleyn is a breed that is growing because it performs well, it produces the goods, which is good fat lambs, and is prolific. The Ayrshire breed is a minority breed, so they were one of the most common breeds in the UK and so there aren't that many of them around. But they're not rare yet. Cherry Ripe: I believe you've also got some Tamworth pigs. David Wilson: Yes, we've got Tamworth pigs and we've got large black pigs, and they're both breeds that jockey for bottom place on the Rare Breed Survival Trust list, so they've become very rare. The last black got down to about 200 recently, and the problem is you get bloodlines getting very close, and you can get problems like that. Cherry Ripe: What, with in-breeding? David Wilson: With in-breeding, yes, in-breeding and line-breeding, you know where they overlap can be a bit of a grey area. But the reason we've got them is because they're on the critical part of the Rare Breeds list, and so we want to support them. Cherry Ripe: That's not just a gentleman's hobby, having these interesting breeds of animal? David Wilson: It is a bit of a hobby, but actually underpinning that is a really serious element. We've got something like fourteen different breeds on the farm, I should think eleven of those are rare breeds, and the reason we keep them is to keep the gene pool alive. The Prince of Wales is Patron of the Rare Breed Survival Trust, and if you like, we're doing our bit for the Trust, which has been a fantastic organisation that have stopped many of our farm animals from becoming extinct. We lost a huge number in the first half of the century, and certainly up to the '70s when everyone woke up to the fact that we were really losing everything. And the serious issue is that we now depend on fewer genes than ever for our food. We've lost 95% of our food genes, or something like that, in the last 100 years, it's a phenomenal and frightening figure. And so if you haven't got those genetics, you haven't got the ability to breed around problems that are likely to arise. And if you look at the natural world, genetic diversity is a strength, and mankind, in his infinite wisdom, is doing the complete opposite, and that leaves us in a very, very vulnerable position. Cherry Ripe: Domestic plant biodiversity is an issue about which the Prince of Wales is also very concerned. In the kitchen garden at Highgrove, each year Prince Charles' head gardener, David Howard, propagates rare, old varieties of vegetables which are in danger of disappearing. David Howard: What we have here is a small plot in the walled garden that we've dedicated here to the growing of heritage seed varieties. You may or may not be aware that under EU rules we have a thing called the National List, and the National List deems whether it's actually legal or not to grow a vegetable. And by grow a vegetable, I mean actually propagate it to sell the produce and to sell the seed. Plant breeders are producing new varieties all the time; as these varieties are registered, they tend to be accepted onto the National List and other varieties drop off the bottom of the National List. As soon as those varieties have dropped off the bottom of the National List, it becomes illegal to grow them and to sell the produce and to sell the seed. So inevitably, if you're not growing them, they're going to be lost, and we lose a certain amount of genetic material there. So Henry Doubleday Research Association many years ago, formed the Heritage Seed Library, and this works very much like an ordinary library. You go to the library and borrow a book, you read it, and you take it back. Here, you go the library, you borrow some seed, you grow it in your garden. If you enjoy it, you eat it, you save some seeds, you can give some seed to your friends, that's not illegal, and you can take some back to the library. That way, the variety will be propagated forevermore, it's not illegal to do that, but it is illegal to sell the produce and to sell the seed. So every year we have a small plot here, and we use this for our ten heritage varieties, we save the seed, we do eat some, we do enjoy it, and hopefully we use it as a model to show the visitors what's going on in the commercial world, that varieties are being lost, and unless organisations like Henry Doubleday Research Association do something about it, they'll be lost forever. Cherry Ripe: It is a bizarre situation, because old varieties of seed that have been grown for ten generations, nobody's prepared to pay to have them registered, so they just disappear. David Howard: They just disappear, and fortunately Henry Doubleday are there, the Crimson Flag Broadbean I understand from one lady down in Kent who'd grown it for many, many years, she'd inherited it from her parents, and sadly now she's passed on, but before she passed on, she passed some of that seed to Henry Doubleday Research Association. It's not throughout all gardens in the UK, and that's one huge success story for that variety. A similar thing happened with a little potato variety, a potato that's purple, red and white in colour, and this was a variety that a gentleman up in Northumberland had been growing for years. He'd apparently got it from a gypsy that was travelling from Hungary, and he grew it in his garden. Now it's available through the Organic Gardening Catalogue. Cherry Ripe: But the Crimson Flag Broadbean, does that mean that Henry Doubleday actually registered it as a variety, or did they just loan the seeds for propagation? David Howard: They don't actually have to register it as a variety, because what they're doing is not commercial. Cherry Ripe: So they're just a lending library for it? David Howard: Yes, absolutely. Cherry Ripe: So what do we have here. They look like runner beans. David Howard: We've got dwarf French beans here, Emperor of Russia, we've got Parrot Red Elephant, Beetroot Bull's Blood, the lettuce have been harvested, they've gone. I believe the variety was called Stoat, and we've got Endive left. Cherry Ripe: What's so special about those carrots? David Howard: It's an enormous carrot. If you have a look here, even the label tells you it's a highly unconventional carrot, broad-shoulders, stump-rooted. It has superb flavour and can be eaten at any stage. It's fast-growing, is a deep orange-red colour. Cherry Ripe: Because at Henry Doubleday they actually have white carrots, and apparently the original carrots which cane here from Holland, were white. David Howard: I was on holiday in Cornwall earlier this year, and on the clifftops, on the North Cornish coast, you can see wild carrot growing there, and they are white in colour. You can get yellow-coloured carrots, orange, various shades of red, right through to purple, and eating carrots doesn't have to be boring. Cherry Ripe: Later, in another corner of Prince Charles' garden at Highgrove, over near the stables, head gardener, David Howard shows us a small walled garden which is dedicated solely to endangered varieties of apples. David Howard: These were a gift to the Prince of Wales by the Brogdale Trust, which looks after our national fruit collection. And they represent the oldest and scarcest varieties of apples in the country. One or two varieties that we've got here, this is Winter Pearmain, a very old variety, sadly out of fashion now, but still worth keeping. A little bit further along, we've got a wonderful cooker called Devonshire Buckland. It doesn't have the keeping life that a Bramley has, probably only 2 to 3 weeks, but a wonderful apple when it's in season. A little further along, we've got Annie Elizabeth a wonderful eater at this time of the year. Next to that, Hunt's Duke of Gloucester. Hunt's Duke of Gloucester is a russet apple, really quite small. So the supermarkets wouldn't be interested in it, but if you've ever tasted one, it tastes of pineapple. So some of these old varieties are really worth keeping, and the most important thing, along with the vegetables in the walled garden, is looking after that genetic material. On the other side of the orchard we've got a variety called White Juneatin, 'Juneatin' is a corruption of 'June eating', and 400 years ago this variety was around, and in those days it probably ripened in June. It's certainly ripe in July, so here we have an apple that's got a gene for early ripening. And we could take that gene and put it in to another apple variety and actually have a commercial apple variety that will harvest in early July and be available in supermarkets. So it's important to look after this genetic material. Cherry Ripe: The Chair of the Soil Association, Craig Sams, is less concerned with biodiversity than with chemical inputs in agriculture. Craig Sams: The use of pesticides, herbicides and chemical fertilizers, not only replace animal manures and other treatments, but mainly they replace labour, because labour is an expensive input on a farm, and it's possible to run larger and larger farms with fewer and fewer workers, and quite often those workers are people who did once own their own farms before they went under. When a farmer applies nitrates or pesticides which are made from fossil fuels, the money for that ends up going straight to a chemical company, who buys the oil from Texas or Saudi Arabia, wherever the fossil fuel feedstock comes from. So the money's gone. When you pay a labourer who's working on your land, that money stays right there in the village or in the town, it gets spent at the local post office, or on buses, or on whatever, so there's a whole benefit over and above the actual money cost, of supporting rural employment and the rural economy, and therefore the sort of fabric of rural society. And that's one of the unforeseen costs of the superficial saving of chemical fertilizers, and when you look back at how chemical fertilizers were introduced, they were around since the 1840s, but their use didn't take off until the 1950s which is when every government around the world, under pressure from chemical companies, started subsidising farmers to use fertilizers, theoretically to get more yield, and yes, you do get higher yields in cases, but yields is just one thing. We could produce more motor cars, but ultimately you produce what the market demands, and up until the introduction of those subsidies, farmers very rarely used any of those chemicals because the economics didn't work out. And that's without all the local benefits that come from using human beings, and having people who actually are working on the land in the countryside. Cherry Ripe: There have been two recent reports examining the social impacts of organic farming, one commissioned by the British government, and another by the Soil Association. Peter Melchert is its Policy Director. Peter Melchert: Both reports have found really organic farming contributes significantly to the economy, employs more people, attracts younger people back into agriculture, a very, very positive message. Cherry Ripe: Organic farming's often been though of as a rich man's hobby, because you have to be very wealthy in order to be able to establish yourself as an organic farmer, and the years of transformation. But I understand that the union movement is now suddenly getting interested in organic farming. Peter Melchert: Well because organic farming supports more jobs, the trades unions are interested, and they've certainly supported our work in this, and backed our report. But I'd question whether this is a rich man's hobby, because after all, if you're going to set up now in an industrial or an intensive farm, you're talking about buying farm machinery, huge machines, costing hundreds of thousands of pounds, dairy herds of 500 or 1,000 cattle require buildings costing millions. Organic farming really all of that capital investment and the use of chemicals is replaced a lot of it, by human labour, by employing people to do the work. So it's not only healthier and better for the environment, it's better for people and provides much more interesting and varied jobs on the farm. Cherry Ripe: Organic farming has grown hugely in the UK in the last 20 years. Sales of organic products are increasing by over $5-million a week. By Patrick Holden's count, organic farms now number nearly 5,000. Patrick Holden: About 4,500 and I think we're a similar percentage in percentage terms, about 4.5% of the total land area farmed organically. But I see this as being only in the foothills of what is needed, and what can be achieved. Cherry Ripe: Aren't figures much higher in parts of Europe? Patrick Holden: Yes, they are, and that's because of the history of a greater level of concern for environmental issues in the broadest sense, that I think other European member states have. But in market terms, I think it's generally acknowledged that the UK organic food market is one of the most dynamically expanding in Europe, and it's growing at the moment at around 20% or 25% a year, which is really very strong. Cherry Ripe: So what are the other countries in Europe that are ahead of England? Patrick Holden: In land area, Austria, Germany, Denmark and Sweden. I believe that the area in Austria is now around 8% or 10%, maybe even higher than that, and perhaps a similar area in Sweden and Denmark. Cherry Ripe: What proportion of people in countries like India and China are still on the land, involved in agriculture. Patrick Holden: It's probably about 2-billion people who are living a pretty close-to-nature, subsistence agriculture. Now we are not advocating in the Soil Association that everybody in the developed world should go back to those kind of farming systems. But what we are saying is that if we want to say to developing countries 'Don't go where we've already gone', there was a sort of moral bankruptcy about saying that, unless we can demonstrate that we're developing a new model of self-sufficient, decentralised, sustainable agriculture, which is employment intensive, as a counter-measure to this unrealistic expectation which everyone now has, for ever-increasing resources. That just strengthens the imperative of us to do something about developing these big models of sustainable agriculture.
