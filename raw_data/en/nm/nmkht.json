We wish you a wonderful and relaxing summer. At our clinic doctors and complementary medicine professionals work together in the pursuit of providing a complete Integrative Medicine offering. We believe in customized and precise medicine, catering to the specific concerns of every individual. At Biomedic Clinic & Research both conventional and complementary medicine (also referred to as \"natural medicine\", in that it is without side effects) are offered, with the viewpoint that it isn't \"alternative\" medicine, but rather one united medical approach, covering a 360 degree scope. The ideal consolidation of all available knowledge in order to provide the patient with the most effective solutions. Our clinic includes 6 fully-equipped exam rooms: 2 are designated for our biophysical testing, 1 for general medicine, support therapies in Oncology and the Kyminasi Diet (our patented Weight Loss Program), 1 for Posturology and Physiotherapy, 1 for Biocompatible Dentistry, and 1 for Specialized Medicine examinations (Cardiology, Urology, Aesthetic medicine, Orthopedics,), as well and 4 therapy rooms. Biomedic Clinic & Research is open from Tuesday to Saturday from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM and closed on Sunday and Monday. Biomedic Clinic & Research is located in Northern Italy, near the Italian Fashion Capital: Milan (about 40 Km, or 25 miles and about a 40 minutes drive). We are very close to beautiful Lake Como (about 15 Km, or 9 miles, about a 15 minutes drive). BIOMEDIC CLINIC & RESEARCH - Via Belvedere, 11 - 22079 Villa Guardia (COMO) ITALY - Phone: +39 031 928764 - www.biomediccenter.com The program is carried out by performing a test on a capillary blood sample (a drop of blood previously collected by the patient himself) and a personalized monthly home treatment based on the test outcome. A simplified introduction to Biophysics and Bioresonance. The video is in italian with subtitles in english. A complementary medicine program aimed at stimulating the immune system. It has both a preventive and accelerating recovery function in the acute illness phase or in case of infection. An integrated medicine program aimed at supporting the immune system in preparation for and following vaccination in the case of both children and adults. Although it is preferable to start the program before the vaccination, it can also be carried out after the vaccination administration and also months later. Fill out the form and submit your situation as a preliminary step. Our team will meet to evaluate your clinical case, taking into account also any exams already in your possession that we ask, if possible, to attach. We'll reply as soon as possible. There is a natural law governing the organic processes of every living being. These processes are first generated, and then controlled, by electromagnetic oscillations identifiable by their specific frequencies, intensities, durations, and wave formations. Each living cell emits these oscillations, which repeat and travel at lighting speed, providing, in every split second, detailed information about the entire organism and its current condition. But they don't just tell us how the organism is doing, they also tell us what needs to be done in order to return it to its healthiest and most ideal state-not unlike the \"feedback system\" concept in the field of Information Technology. These wave frequencies contain a multitude of data, which, as a whole, comprise the very specific and individual spectrum identifying each patient. Although Bioresonance is widely used, especially in Central and Northern Europe, the tests do not have definitive scientific validity as established by the international scientific community. However, our thirty-year clinical experience has shown us that this type of testing can be invaluable in many cases. The test is done with the person seated on a chair beside the technician and in front of the bioresonance device. It can be carried out at any time and does not require undressing or any preparatory actions, such as fasting. We prefer live tests and subsequent treatments, but in case the patient is unable to come personally, the test can be also carried out through a blood pic, and the treatment is sent in the form of drops or device. This therapy can be considered a type of \"regulatory medicine\", comparable to homeopathy, although it is far more customizable and exact. It aims to stimulate the body, by activating the organism's own regulatory abilities, and then restoring its balance. In this video is a practical example of this phenomenon: ...an especially clear illustration if we keep in mind that our organism is made almost entirely of water.

Each biophysical test on a dried blood sample costs \u20ac 500. 1 - The result will be emailed to you. 2 - You will be given the opportunity to carry out the treatment for what came out from the test in order to restore balance. This treatment can take place in two ways: at our medical center in Italy or through a home treatment. The treatment performed at the medical center in Italy is planned in advance, it consists of a test and two treatments a day for 5 days a week (from Tuesday to Saturday) for an estimated number of weeks based on the first test outcome (this can vary from 1 to 4 weeks). The cost of the treatment ranges from 400 to 500 \u20ac per day. This is the most recommended way as the intensive treatment allows you to obtain results faster. The home program is a repetitive 4 weeks treatment that involves a check-up test at the end of each month of treatment, the program is carried out untill the complete rebalancing of the values that came out from the first test. Obviously, this choice involves a longer treatment that could take from 5 months to 2 years in order to achieve the same results as the intensive program performed at the medical center. This type of treatment costs on average \u20ac 800 per month. At the medical center, a daily one hour test is performed on the patient by a healthcare technician with the use of specific electro-medical equipment, followed by two treatment sessions of 45 minutes each, using an electro-medical imachine while the patient is lying on a couch. Test and treatments last about 4 hours a day. The home treatment is carried out by performing a monthly test on a capillary blood sample (a drop of blood previously collected by the patient himself) and a personalized monthly home treatment based on the test outcome. The treatment is shipped to the patient and it can be in the form of drops to take daily, a product for the skin or a small wearable device. The specific frequencies are loaded on these products. In most cases, you will have to follow food abstentions or indications that prohibit the intake of certain foods during the entire program. The food abstention lists provide recommended replacement foods. For this reason and in order to avoid excessively long food abstentions, it is preferable to do the intensive program carried out at the medical center. For both programs, it is essential to drink 2 to 3 liters of water daily in order to counteract the strong detoxifying action of the program, and to allow the activation of the modulating frequencies in the body that are carried by water. When shipping the blood sample, please also attach a sample and the name of every medication or supplement you are currently taking so we can test it for compatibility. L'astensione alimentare personalizzata Personalized food abstentions will automatically implement a detoxification process that will bring the values of intolerant or non-metabolized foods from a chronic to an acute state (high values = chronic, lower values = acute). This mechanism reduces symptoms during the program as long as you do not consume these foods, but in case these foods were to be taken voluntarily or accidentally (even in small quantities), since you would still be in the acute range, intense symptoms could appear, slowing down the program and probably require a prolongation of the treatment. At the end of the program, a gradual re-introduction of the previously intolerant or non-metabolised foods will be undertaken. In a few weeks all the intolerant foods will be reintroduced and you will be able eat them again. However, we recommend not to exceed in consuming the foods you were previously intolerant to.

Every day an organism enters in symbiosis with the frequencies it also receives from outer stimuli, and the details of these spectrums are an essential part of bioresonance, as well. Today, using highly specialized equipment, it is possible to locate ailments by a system of comparison: bioresonance can detect the oscillations of the patient and then compare them to the established healthy oscillations with which the body should be operating. These optimal healthy \"standard\" oscillations are classified and registered as part of a vast database to use as benchmarks for optimal health, and allow us to see where there are discrepancies with the patient's own. Bioresonance therapy uses the electromagnetic waves produced by the cells to treat imbalances in the body, inverting the disturbed frequencies in to their correct, harmonious form and then feeding them back to the body. This process is completely natural and without any type of side effect. An improvement of the biophysical condition of the organism will help it to attain a gradual normalization of its biochemical processes, thus supporting its overall health and healing. Although Bioresonance is widely used, especially in Central and Northern Europe, the tests do not have definitive scientific validity as established by the international scientific community. However, our thirty-year clinical experience has shown us that this type of testing can be invaluable in many cases. The information obtained from a Biophysical Test cannot, in any way, replace conventional medical examinations and testing, but rather is to be considered from a biophysical standpoint. The results are not obtained with conventional laboratory testing. The first test is carried out by a technician only after a full medical exam has been performed. The purpose of this first test is to identify the possible areas of trouble on which the doctor can focus his own medical analysis, to then evaluate potentially prescribing further conventional exams. Moreover, it is directed towards locating any correlation between the patient's health complaints and the nutritional considerations, vitamin/mineral deficiencies, toxicities resulting from anything the patient regularly consumes, and any other individual issues. Based on the information collected from the first test, a program of treatments and further testing can be mapped out, with the objective of restoring balance to the organism for the issues at-hand. Continued testing during the course of treatments is necessary to monitor the progress and changes in the condition which the therapy is accomplishing, and modify it accordingly. The test is done with the person seated on a chair beside the technician and in front of the bioresonance device. It can be carried out at any time and does not require undressing or any preparatory actions, such as fasting. It is important to bring with you to the test a sample of any dietary supplement, pharmaceutical drug, homeopathic product, phytotherapy treatment, etc., that you are regularly taking, so that the technician can verify with greater precision the exact effects these substances are having on the body. Electrical conductivity imbalances Intolerances / allergies Toxic reactions to: X-rays - electric current - radiation - Bluetooth, electrosmog etc - food additives - insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, etc.- heavy metals Free radicals Immune, endocrine, hormonal, glandular, oxygenation and glucose imbalances Minerals, vitamins, amino acids and antioxidants deficiencies Dysbiosis or infections from microorganisms Metabolic disorders Imbalances of venous and arterial circulation, scar tissue. Various system and organ imbalaces or degeneration Incompatibility with drugs and supplements (please send samples and descriptions of every product you are taking) Bioresonance treatments use the electromagnetic frequencies generated by the patient's own cells in order to carry out the necessary therapy. The therapy is based on a well-known principle in physical science: that a wave of a particular frequency can be cancelled out by inverting that same wave's form, and then feeding it back to the source. Treatment after treatment the faulty wave becomes smaller and smaller until it is completely flat and the healthy frequency is then re-instilled. The treatment is carried out comfortably laying down on a therapy bed. It is not necessary to undress, though some people are more comfortable removing their shoes. Many people drift off to sleep during the treatment, as they find it particularly relaxing. The duration of a treatment can vary from half an hour to a maximum of one hour. It is also possible to receive more than one treatment per day, up to a maximum of three, in order to speed up the program and obtain the maximum benefits sooner. This allows people coming in from out of the area, or even abroad, to carry out an intensive program, maximizing their time at the center and obtaining the desired results. Each treatment is customized according to the results of a newly performed test, which is done just prior to the therapy, in order to monitor the changes that have taken place as a result of the preceding treatments. The course of treatment is completed when the specific frequency values of the disturbances at-hand have reached zero. This value means that the organism keeps the \"memory\" of that problem, but it cannot negatively affect him anymore. For example, in the case of a food intolerance which causes a number of ailments for the person, that value can begin at an 8 and, treatment after treatment, reach 0. It will now be possible for the person to ingest that food again without any negative consequences. After a completed program, this new state of the organism is lasting. Further checkups are carried out after a few months in order to verify the stability of the condition and evaluate the possible need for a an additional treatment, for reinforcement. "}
