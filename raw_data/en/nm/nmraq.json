Therefore, public health officials around the world- and in the U.S in particular- are constantly challenged The Flu Shot To get the flu vaccine or not to get the flu vaccine? This is a huge controversial question millions of Americans today ask themselves every year. There are many myths that come along with the topic of the flu vaccine that lead to people questioning the effectiveness of the medication. Safety for our families and loved ones is what we aim to achieve, but what are the pros and cons of this vaccine? What are the consequences and what are myths, but most importantly: what are the reasons we should get it in the first place? In this paper you will learn the many reasons for the flu vaccination and how it affects different populations beginning with children all the way to the elderly population. First of all, what is the flu According to the \"Commonwealth of Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services\" that as of February 2, 2018 that there have been 100 flu-related fatalities from the flu this year alone and at least four of those deaths were children. The influenza shot is an inactivated vaccine made of inactive germs. Because the germs in this vaccination are inactivated or killed, the shot will cause the patients to not get the flu. However, this shot will allow your body to create the antibodies needed to ward off the influenza virus. I feel that for school-aged students under the age of 18 the flu shot should be Last year, only twenty-six percent of eighteen to forty-nine year olds got the flu shot (Singh, 2014). With an average of 200,000 people hospitalized annually due to flu-related symptoms, these low vaccination rates are generating serious health risks among young adults all over the country (National Consumers League, 2013). This winter, at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C., the average age of people hospitalized with influenza was 28.5 years old, and of those that ended up in the Intensive Care Unit of the hospital, only two of the twenty-two had received the flu vaccination (Singh, 2014). The primary reason that young adults do not get the influenza vaccination is that they believe that they are invincible and influenza is not a serious illness (Singh, 2014). One in five Americans who do not receive the influenza vaccination claims that influenza is not a serious illness (National Consumers League, 2013). Of the Americans who do not get vaccinated, forty-five percent cited their good health as a rationale for bypassing vaccination (National Consumers League, 2013). This may be partly due to the targeted measures by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to increase vaccination rates among children and the elderly. In comparison to the twenty-six percent of young adults that were vaccinated, 56.6% of children (ages six months to seventeen years old) and 66.2% of seniors (ages 65 and older) were vaccinated. When targeted measures are used, they work. The problem Issue Proposal on the Efficacy of Flu Shots In recent years encouragement to get flu shots has become a yearly mantra. Elderly, children six months to two years, health care workers and immune-deficient people are urged in the strongest terms to go to their doctors or clinics and get a flu shot. This group encompasses about 98 million people. In the fall of 2004 this was in the forefront of American and to some extent the Western World media with the shortage of this flu seasons vaccine. Current medical wisdom states that flu shots are safe, effective and prevent mortality. A recent study published by The Journal of the American Medicine Association (JAMA) has brought the current wisdom into question. On February 14, 2005 JAMA There are there types of influenza A and C or the most severe types and B which is the most common, Luckily not the to severe. The virus works by first attaching to the outside of a host cell. It injects its RNA into the cell. Unfortunately our cells treat the RNA like they should. It translates the viral genes using the cell's ribosomes and enzymes. Now the virus can take the cell over and use it to reproduce more viruses. Sooner or later it releases the new nauseating viruses and they search for another cell to raid. 4) Second pre-BLA meeting: December 15, 20101 5) BLA Approval: November 20, 2012 Pharmacologic Class: Vaccine Introduction and description of the product: FLUCELVAX\u00ae is a first of its kind flu vaccine, approved by U.S. FDA to use cell culture technology. FLUCELVAX\u00ae, an intramuscular injection is used in the prevention of seasonal flu caused by influenza virus types A (subtypes H1N1 and H3N2) and B.1 It is indicated for use in individuals of age 18 years or older.1 The manufacturing process uses mammalian cells instead of chicken eggs to grow viral strains. It is a trivalent and inactivated influenza vaccine, consisting of a continuous cell line of Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells.1 \"The formulation of FLUCELVAX\u00ae contains 45 micrograms (mcg) hemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5 mL dose in 15 mcg HA of each of the following three influenza strains: A/Brisbane/10/2010 (wild type) (H1N1); A/South Australia/55/2014 (wild type) (H3N2); B/Utah/9/2014. Residual amounts in each dose of FLUCELVAX\u00ae may contain MDCK cell protein (8.4 mcg), a protein other than HA ( 120 mcg), ( 1125 The 2013-2014 flu season. As of February 8, 2014, an estimated 60% of hospital admissions as a result of ILI had transpired in people between the ages of 18-64. Additionally, 22% of documented ILI hospitalizations among women between the ages of 15-44 (childbearing age) had transpired among those who were pregnant. Results of the weekly report displayed significant levels of protection associated with vaccination in those 18-64. Initial calculations for the 2013-2014 flu season demonstrated that as of the middle of November, a mere 34% of persons between the ages of 18-64 had received the vaccine in comparison to 41% of young children (6 months-17). Among persons aged 65 and older 62% received the vaccine.6 It takes about eight months for the vaccines to be developed using chicken eggs. If another pandemic were to arise, we would not have access to the vaccines for at least eight months. Moreover, once the vaccines are made, they must be used. Vaccines that are not used cannot be stored and must be destroyed because the vaccines break down. The vaccines do include the three influenza viruses; two against different strains of type A, and one against the type B virus. (Tenpenny, 2008, Davidson, 2007-2009, Offit, 2008). Community Teaching- Influenza Vaccine Jessica Alves December 11, 2015 According to Healthy People 2020 a goal of theirs is to \"increase immunization rates and reduce preventable infections.\" The influenza virus is one of these preventable infections, which can cause serious harm to patients. The influenza virus is known as the \"flu.\" Everyone in his or her life has had some experience with the flu, whether that is himself or herself or a family member. What if there was a way to ensure people from contracting a strain of the influenza virus? Well, thanks to technology and medical research there is. Influenza Vaccines Summary This paper explores published works related to patients who received the flu vaccine who were sixty-five years and older. The evaluated articles examine the effectiveness the flu vaccine had on the patient population of sixty-five years and older in relation to avoiding the flu and pneumonia diseases and hospitalizations, in this group of patients. It has been conceded for years that senior adults age sixty-five and older are at greater risk from an influenza illness and pneumonia than a vigorous young adult. It has been projected that between 71 percent and 85 percent of seasonal flu-related loss of life have happened in people sixty-five years and older and between 54 percent and 70 percent of seasonal On a global level, the influenza vaccination in children is recommended and strongly encouraged. These vaccinations are recommended for children especially if they are to be exposed to a daycare or school environment because of the potential for spreading infection. Unfortunately, the influenza vaccine is not administered as needed because of the lack of education about the effectiveness and complications for physicians and parents. Also, the vaccination is not always readily available. Many clinicians vary on there methods and routines of administering the vaccine, although its proven effectiveness warrants a more uniformed practice of delivery. Based on clinical studies, an increase of this vaccination is recommended to protect against the complications and spread of influenza. Vaccinations can be important to one regardless of their age. The influenza vaccine specially can prevent the spread of diseases and in some cases, even death. Some may not realize the seriousness of influenza and what effects it can have on them. Influenza can have a The pathogen is inactivated either by heat or chemicals or radiations. These factors incapable the microbes of causing disease, but maintain some of its immunogenic properties. Such vaccines are more stable and safer than live vaccines because the inactivated microbes cannot mutate back and cause disease. Killed vaccines are safe, non-infectious and characterized with ease in manufacturing but having many drawbacks such as, these vaccines induce only weak, short-lived and insufficient immunity. As well they have many problems with stability, long-term protection, and present biosafety risks. Therefore large and multiple doses are needed to confer protective immunity, beside immunogenicity of this vaccine usually enhanced by addition of an adjuvants.
