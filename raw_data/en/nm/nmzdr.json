Referrals may be placed without consulting with the specialist team. Urgent Care providers may still send patients back to a PCP for a referral at their discretion. PCPs will be notified when their patient is referred to a specialist through our standard after-visit summary. We made this change to help improve patient access, decrease work for PCPs, prevent unnecessary emergency department visits and eliminate delayed care. If you have questions, please contact "}
