In November, Santa Clara County, Calif., voters approved a ballot measure that will cap the compensation of executives at non-profit El Camino Hospital in Mountain View, Calif., to no more than twice the salary of California's governor (or no more than $330,000). However, the hospital plans to fight the measure in the courts and is asking at-torneys to see if it is, in fact, legal. continued on page 8continued on page 24 Special Section: Hospital Executive & Physician Compensation p. 24 What Makes a Hospital Attractive to Employers? By Molly Gamble Population health management has be-come a mainstay in the American health-care landscape, but many hospitals and health systems are still determining what \"population health\" looks like for their organization. Most recently, physician groups, hospitals and insurers have be-come hyper-focused on accountable care organizations, patient-centered medical homes and other performance-driven models. But as providers and payors partnered for these initiatives, one major player seemed to be missing from the broader picture: employers. And right now, as large em-ployers face pressures to trim healthcare costs, better manage employees' health coverage or completely revise their ben-efit plans, companies are eager to engage in partnerships. \"It's a relatively new phenomenon, start- ing with large national employers who are pushing the envelope,\" says Warren Skea, PhD, director in PwC's health enterprise continued on page 10 REGISTER TODAY!

It plans to achieve those goals at the cost of the traditional funding mechanisms and levels that providers have come to rely on, which could spell disaster for the unprepared. Being prepared requires providers to not only know and adapt to what's coming, but also to be able to explain what has changed to their patients and business partners. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act represents enormous upheaval to the healthcare industry's status quo, so here is a recap of what's happened, what's to come, and what hospitals should be doing to ready themselves for the PPACA. Reform so far President Barack Obama signed the PPACA into law March 23, 2010, but the lead-up to its passing was a hard-fought battle. There were rumors of \"death panels\" enabling government-sponsored euthanasia resulting from rationed funding for healthcare. A public health insurance option intended to compete with private insurers was rejected twice. And although the Su-preme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law's contentious individ-ual health insurance mandate in June 2012, it struck down the requirement for all states to expand their Medicaid programs, relegating that part of the law as optional for each state. Much of the law so far has begun to turn the wheels of the health indus- try in the direction of growing primary care, promoting and protecting consumers' access to coverage and introducing funding models that share payors' risk and gains with providers. 2010 \u2014 Expanding access to more people, the 2010 law immediately be- gan to disburse tax credits for small businesses' health plans and rebates to seniors for prescription drugs. Children could no longer be denied cover - age due to pre-existing conditions, and some state and federal insurance plans were created for adults with pre-existing conditions who had been uninsured for six months or more. Young adults under 26 not offered in-surance from their employer were permitted to stay on their parent's plan. Anticipating the boost in demand, education assistance was established to attract more primary care nurses and physicians into underserved areas. Within the health plans themselves, types of preventive care became cov- ered without charging a copay or deductible, and no lifetime limits on hospital stays or other essential benefits can be imposed. More assistance was given to seniors buying Medicare Part D-covered drugs and receiving preventive services, and at the same time the Obama administration added defenses against corruption and unreasonable business practices. Extra funding was pumped into fraud-busting programs to cut unlawful billing of Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP , and into state groups with authority to review or regulate insurance premium increases. 2011 \u2014 In 2011, a major limit on insurance companies was imposed that re - quired them to spend at least 80 to 85 percent of premium dollars on health- care or quality improvement, rather than administrative costs or profits, or else send rebates to customers. Gradual reductions to insurance companies in the Medicare Advantage program began, slowly shrinking the $1,000 bo- nus paid per beneficiary on average compared with traditional Medicare. Elderly and disabled beneficiaries gained a wealth of new services designed to decrease the amount of time they spent hospitalized, free preventive care for certain services, assistance designing care plans and coordinating sup-port services when they were discharged from a hospital visit, and freedom for states to use Medicaid funding to pay for cheaper at-home care versus nursing home admittance. Medicare beneficiaries also began to receive a 50 percent discount on Part D-covered brand-name prescription drugs.Money was granted to public health programs and services to help Amer - icans purchase sensible private insurance. Efforts to build and renovate community health centers gained new financial support, and payments for rural providers went up. 2012 \u2014 Last year saw a swath of changes, including the advent of ac- countable care organizations established in order to design cost-effective approaches to care delivery in exchange for sharing in CMS' savings. In October 2012, hospitals meeting certain benchmarks for electronic health records became eligible for incentive payments as part of provi-sions included in the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. That same month, CMS began its Value-Based Purchasing program, which alters how much it pays hospitals through Medicare depending on its performance on various quality measures including patient satisfaction and hospital read- mission rates. 2013 \u2014 Beginning this year, funding changes to Medicaid will reimburse primary physicians at Medicare rates through 2014. The federal govern- ment will also increase funding to states that craft Medicaid programs with better benefits for preventive care. And a national pilot program to pro - mote bundled payment models has gone into effect, which would allow providers to take on risks and profit potential from efficient use of Medi- care funds. Coming soon There's more to come from the law, especially next year in 2014. That's when nearly all adults and children must obtain health insurance or pay a fine, which will be the greater of 1 percent of income or $95 per adult ($285 for a family) next year but will balloon to the greater of 2.5 per - cent of income or $695 ($2,085 per family) by 2016. Penalties for much wealthier families can grow as high as the average basic-level government-approved health plan's annual premiums. Employers of more than 50 full-time workers will need to offer minimum essential coverage or pay a fine for each eligible worker above a threshold who is not offered coverage. Each state will have an online health insurance marketplace, referred to as an exchange, that will offer qualified private plans for individuals and small businesses, and screen customers to see if they are eligible for subsidies, tax credits or Medicaid. Enrollment for these begins in October this year, with coverage going live Jan. 1, 2014. All but a few Republican states have shunned the idea of running their own exchanges, opting instead for the federal government to take on the job. Supporters say the marketplaces increase competition and will benefit consumers, thus creating less need for government insurance programs. One of the most hotly contested features of the PPACA, even today, began to receive funding in 2011. The Independent Payment Advisory Board, an appointed panel of healthcare experts, will be charged with making binding cost-cutting plans for Medicare payments beginning in 2015 that Congress can override only through new legislation that achieves the same level of savings. Republicans have vowed to eliminate the IPAB, and even some Democrats have raised an eyebrow at the concept. Originally, the law intended for all states to be required to expand Medicaid to more poor and childless adults at 133 percent of federal poverty line. But when the Supreme Court nixed that mandate, the Obama administra-tion fell back on incentivizing states to volunteer to expand Medicaid with a guaranteed three years during which the increased cost of the expansion will be covered entirely by the federal government. After that, states will only contribute 10 percent of the extra cost. Medicare disproportionate share hospital payments, the lifeblood of some critical access and safety-net hospitals, will plummet 75 percent in October, but they'll be offset by larger payments based on a hospital's proportion of uninsured served and uncompensated care provided.Health Reform in 2013: What's Happened, What's Left & What it Means for Providers (continued from page 1)9 Sign up for the COMPLIMENTARY Becker's Hospital Review CEO Report & CFO Report E-Weeklies at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 What hospitals can do to get ready It's going to take strong hospital leadership to weather what could either be a windfall or a typhoon. Following is some advice from healthcare leaders and experts for how to prepare for the flood of changes and regulations. Expect upfront costs. The law's goal is to lower healthcare costs over the long term, but in the short term, most will feel the changes in their check-books. Doug Fenstermaker, a former hospital CFO now serving as managing director and vice president of healthcare at Atlanta-based Warbird Consult - ing Partners, says he's skeptical of significant savings for providers in the near future, because the cost of implementing the law has a lot of upfront cost. \"It is hard to tell whether the PPACA will result in a lower amount of GDP being consumed by healthcare and if costs will actually decline. In the short-term, that is not at all likely, as investments in infrastructure to make it all work will skyrocket,\" he says. While the law aims to improve coordination in the delivery of care and better use of ramped up technology to lower costs, the initial capital cost of that infrastructure will take time to be paid off. Preserve margins with more savings, not more revenue. Bun- dled payments, Medicare Advantage and shared savings programs with CMS and private insurers can be lucrative for health systems, especially if fewer patients are uninsured. True, that may bring a flood of new patients, says Aurelio Fernandez, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Memorial Healthcare System in Hollywood, Fla., but political instability in his state and the country alike means he's not counting on seeing revenues rise. \"I'm not basing our future on the ability of generating [additional] rev- enues, but on having cost-efficiency,\" Mr. Fernandez says. Back in 2011, he says Memorial's leaders did a study and learned its cost structure was too high. So in 2012, he says they embarked on a cost reduc - tion initiative that looked at contractual arrangements, staff reductions and eliminating unnecessary services through partnerships. They set a system-wide cost reduction goal of 5 percent, in excess of $75 million, by the end of their fiscal year which ends this April. So far they've reached 85 percent of that goal, even after realizing costs to implement their electronic health record system this year. Track your performance. The sharp drop in Medicare DSH funding will be a blow to systems like Dignity Health. The San Francisco-based organization's Vice President of External and Government Relations Wade Rose says since Dignity Health is among California's largest providers of Medicare services, the cuts will be a challenging obstacle. He and his sys - tem's leaders support the law overall, but he acknowledges that expecta - tions are quite high on providers to fix inefficiencies that are easy to iden-tify but difficult to improve because of changes that must be systemically implemented. \"The reality on the ground can be very different than the elegant logic of the bill,\" Mr. Rose says. In response, his team is gathering and analyzing copious amounts of data to learn where they can be more efficient, from speeding up imaging test results to designing a nurse's station to maximize productivity, and tracking the impact of these changes on performance. Mr. Rose says that's why this law might be more successful than efforts of the past \u2014 he says 95 percent of the bill has to do with delivery system change, rather than mere funding changes. Look beyond a hospital's four walls. Some of the greatest cost inefficiencies occur after elderly patients leave providers' care. Not follow - ing physicians' orders after being discharged from the hospital can lead to higher readmissions, which the health reform law now penalizes through lower reimbursement rates. As a result, many hospitals have focused much of their efforts into transitioning seniors from the hospital to the home, helping them help themselves stay healthy.Nathan Anspach, CEO of Phoenix-based John C. Lincoln Health Network's accountable care organization, says his organization's solution was to collabo-rate with physicians, clinicians and pharmacists within the ACO to design a systemwide formulary plan. \"We see a pretty significant dollar savings,\" he says. \"We're all about the 5 to 60 rule \u2014 5 percent of our members will use 60 percent of the resources of our ACO,\" Mr. Anspach says. He and his team have addressed that with greater attention on patients with chronic condi-tions like congestive heart failure and diabetes. Keep patients satisfied. Among other metrics, hospitals have begun to see patient satisfaction account for a rise or deduction of up to 1 percent in their Medicare reimbursements. In an era where providers' margins are shrinking for a number of reasons, hospitals can hold on to what's theirs with a focus on patient experience, says Kristin Baird, a registered nurse and CEO of Baird Group, a Fort Atkinson, Wis.-based healthcare consulting firm. \"Patient satisfaction, once seen as fluffy or soft, is now an important mea- sure that cannot and should not be ignored,\" Ms. Baird says. \"Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys have leveled the playing field and give the consumer a voice along with other important outcomes. Healthcare organizations recognize now, more than ever, that providing good service directly impacts the bottom line. That realization has not been so clear before.\" Partner to absorb risk. It's no secret that hospitals are employing more physicians, and that trend of employing or contracting with physicians is likely to continue, says Adam Powell, PhD, a health economist and president of Bos-ton-based healthcare consulting firm Payer+Provider Syndicate. \"In 2013, I expect to see acceleration in the wave of payor-provider inte - gration and hospital consolidation that began in 2012. The recent merger between Baylor Health Care System and Scott & White Healthcare is but one example of how integrated delivery systems are expanding by merging with hospital systems. Hospitals are increasingly being asked to own their risk, and merging with payors and integrated delivery systems provides them the know-how to do so,\" Dr. Powell says. \"Providers are hoping that mergers will provide them with both more leverage in negotiating with payors and economies of scale that will enable them to lower their costs.\" As scrutiny builds over unnecessary inpatient care, Mr. Fenstermaker says hospital systems are likely to divest specialties that aren't core to the business in favor of integrating those services with other systems. For this reason, he says he expects rural hospitals will begin to operate more like ambulatory care clinics and transfer more patients to larger hospitals' specialty centers. The current number of primary care physicians will struggle to meet the anticipated demand brought on by the newly insured, so Mr. Fenstermaker predicts the industry will rely more heavily on physician assistants, practical nurses and technology to compensate for the physician shortage. n REGISTER TODAY!

They proactively go to a provider and say, 'It's important we manage our healthcare costs. We're going to partner with somebody.'\" A major question has been whether large employ - ers will drop coverage in 2014, sending employees to insurance exchanges. But a July 2012 study from Deloitte found 81 percent of companies with 50 or more employees planned to continue providing benefits in the next one to three years. This sug-gests many companies are still looking to optimize their benefit programs rather than abandon them. This article explores providers' direct contracting relationships with self-insured employers, such as bundled payments and narrow networks, and dis-cusses factors that can make or break a provider's chance to be involved in those programs. Lessons from Cleveland Clinic's ties to employers Cleveland Clinic has blazed a trail with its employer partnerships. In 2010, the system struck a direct-to-employer deal with the home improvement gi-ant Lowe's, based in Mooresville, N.C. Under that agreement, more than 225,000 employees and their dependents enrolled in Lowe's self-funded health plan can travel to Cleveland Clinic for heart proce - dures. Lowe's then covers all medical deductibles, coinsurance payments, travel costs and lodging for the patient and a companion. It was an innovative partnership at the time, according to Michael McMillan. As executive director of market and network services for Cleveland Clinic, Mr. McMillan and his team are the architects of Cleveland Clinic's direct-to-employer program, called the Program for Advanced Medical Care. \"It was a unique and innovative approach to solving a couple of problems that, in this case, a large, multi-state employer had.\" Prior to striking the deal, Lowe's observed vari - ability in outcomes among its employees' heart care, as roughly a quarter of a million Lowe's staff throughout the country visited different physicians and hospitals. Furthermore, a \"very small percentage\" of its workforce was gener - ating a large portion of costs, says Mr. McMil-lan. If Lowe's could get employees who needed highly specialized care to an organization that demonstrated the best outcomes, health costs might decline while employee health improved, along with gains in productivity. Cleveland Clinic, rated first in the country for cardiac care by U.S. News & World report since 1994, was an attractive partner for Lowe's. Car - diac surgery is a big-ticket procedure, which justifies the company's reimbursement for air -fare and other travel costs. Since that first deal, Cleveland Clinic has continued forming relation- ships around its centers of excellence with an array of large employers. In October 2012, the system was one of six across the country to partner with Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart. Under that bundled pay - ment program, 1.1 million employees and their dependents covered by Wal-Mart's health plan can travel to Cleveland Clinic for cardiac surgery with the employer covering deductibles and travel costs for the patient and a companion. The clinic also struck a deal with Seattle-based Boeing that same month, under which roughly 200,000 of the aerospace corporation's employees, retirees and dependent family members can receive heart care at the health system for a fixed price. \"We're in active discussions with a lot of em - ployers, and we anticipate having many more re- lationships,\" says Mr. McMillan. \"For this line of business, the idea is that not every patient needs to travel \u2014 we look for services for which travel makes most sense. So we anticipate a number of these arrangements.\" What makes an attractive health system partner? Generally, the employer approaches the provider for potential partnership programs, but experts say health systems can and are becoming more proactive in these discussions. Large employ - ers seek certain traits in a provider partner, and health systems should be prepared to demon-strate these critical qualities to further their part - nership opportunities. Value is at the intersection of a provider's out - comes and its costs, and is the most significant driver for any joint provider-employer initia-tive. As employers become more sophisticated in their understanding of healthcare costs, they will pursue systems that demonstrate quality outcomes, aligned incentives, transparency and the proven ability to manage population health. Outcomes and transparency. Demon- strated positive outcomes are the biggest selling point for providers, but how a system opts to share its outcomes is nearly as important as the data itself. Employers and companies are likely to expect this information to be made available in the next few years, especially as they work to get healthcare costs under control. In the July 2012 Deloitte survey, 37 percent of large em - ployers, or those with more than 2,500 employ - ers, said their core strategy to manage healthcare costs was analyzing costs and outcomes for local physicians and hospitals. In many ways, Cleveland Clinic has led the way in measuring and publicizing its outcomes. CEO Delos \"Toby\" Cosgrove, MD, is credited with developing the system's \"outcomes books\" when he served as chief of cardiac surgery. The system publishes outcomes data in book format for its centers of excellence and makes it avail- able by request, treating these outcomes books as a major investment. The information shows the clinic and its physicians can deliver reliable outcomes with little variability, which is just what employers want in a direct partnership. Aligned incentives. The terms of the part - nership, such as Cleveland Clinic's bundled payment arrangements with employers, will be critical in aligning incentives. Through bundled payments, providers are incentivized to reduce variations and deliver care more efficiently while still delivering superior outcomes. But employers want a partner who has some skin in the game, and a large part of this can also come down to how physicians are paid. Like some other large, integrated systems, Cleveland Clinic has a unique advantage with salaried phy - sicians. This eliminates a host of concerns about unnecessary or duplicative care \u2014 extra services that would come at the employer's expense. \"I think that offers an advantage to employers in that, not only is it one-stop shopping with all services in one box, but because doctors don't have direct financial incentive to do one thing or another aside from what is in the best interest of the patient,\" says Mr. McMillan. Roger Merrill, MD, is CMO of Salisbury, Md.- based Perdue Farms. The poultry company has contracted directly with physicians and hospitals for more than a decade, penning up to roughly 15,000 contracts for more than 30,000 employ - ees and dependents, according to an American Medical Association News report. Leaving the payor out of the mix has worked for Perdue, as its healthcare costs for employees have clocked in at less than half of the national average. \"We at Perdue and the patient and pro - vider all have the same goal,\" Dr. Merrill said in the news report. \"We all want to maximize the health of the patient. Typically, large insurance companies do not have that same goal.\" Geography and access. A provider's em- ployer partner might be located just down the street, across the state, or even halfway across the country \u2014 depending on the service. The cost of cardiac surgery justified the price involved for Lowe's to fly employees to Cleveland for care. And a stream of out-of-state patients is not un- usual for Cleveland Clinic, since about 50 percent of its 4,200 annual heart surgeries are performed on patients from outside Ohio. The system might expand some of its employer partnerships to in- clude orthopedic procedures, since many of those services fall into the big-ticket category as well. The geographic proximity for these partner - ships, or how far employers are willing to send workers for care, comes into question depend- ing on the complexity and cost of the service in question. High-risk procedures might be worth the travel if a provider can demonstrate best What Makes a Hospital Attractive to Employers?

When payors are involved in population health models with employers or providers, they can meet an administrative need and handle claims adjudication. \"But we've also seen models just between the providers and employer directly, cutting out the middle man,\" says Dr. Skea from PwC. \"More often than not, those are typically [relationships] with a provider that has an insurance license and experience with population health.\" Employer-provider relationships do not have to come in parties of three, according to experts. While some models do have a payor involved, it's not a necessary component. But providers that do enter direct employer strategies may need insurance licenses, which can create complexity and extra planning, as the process can take up to 18 months. \"Anything that holds promise for shared savings is attractive to employers,\" says W . Yale Miller, executive vice president of Nashville, Tenn.-based Aegis Health Group. \"I think providers have an opportunity to step into what might be an information void as opposed to saving that conversation for payors. If [providers] are proactive in talking with major employers, they stand to be in better position.\" Providers with prior experi-ence have an advantage, but it's not too late Employers are well-suited to approach health systems that have demonstrated success with pre - vious employer partnerships. Cleveland Clinic is exemplary in this respect, but smaller systems or hospitals may have fewer resources, still operate on fee-for-service payment models or are located in highly competitive markets. Not to fear, say experts. Even health systems with limited experi-ence with employers haven't missed the boat. \"In a funny way, even hospitals that haven't his- torically had employer-facing efforts are still well positioned at the end of the day. After all they too are employers, most of them large ones, facing the same health cost issues,\" says Pearson Talbert, president and CEO of Aegis Health Group, a hospital business development firm. \"It's about refocusing from sick care to healthcare and then re-messaging what you already do.\" One of the richest opportunities for systems looking to expand relationships with employers is to begin with their own workforces. The De - loitte survey found 62 percent of employers an-ticipate increasing their wellness and preventive health programs as part of their benefits strategy in the next three to five years. Companies will be more attractive to hospitals that have done the same and can point to the improved health of their own population. This is a multidimensional task, as hospitals have some of the least healthy employees in the country. A 2012 study by Truven Health Analytics found hospital employees are less healthy than the general workforce and cost more in healthcare spending. But by establishing a wellness program or other population health initiatives, systems can learn initial lessons about population management, fine-tune care processes and use the experience as a foundation for their population health strategy. There are other avenues for health systems that are relatively green in employer relationships. A hospital's occupational health department can serve as a natural extension to managing employ - ees' health, according to Mr. Miller. \"Second, if they're doing some sort of community-based education or health screenings, hospitals can think about redeploying those assets to some key employer groups and providing feedback to employers and their workforces. That's mutually beneficial sharing of information.\" n TruePartnerships. Our switch to HFAP was seam less.

After 15 years in the sys - tem, one might think that Mr. Oostra would al-ready know how staff and physicians feel about ProMedica's culture. But he's not afraid to admit that he doesn't al- ways. In fact, he welcomes input on everything from the system's mission statement to its stra-tegic plan to ensure everyone in ProMedica is on the same cultural page. Here, Mr. Oostra discusses how cultural aware- ness and flow of communication has led the sys - tem to be successful with changes made under healthcare reform and what advancements have him excited about the industry. Question: To start off, can you look back and attempt to sum up 2012? What were some highlights of the year for you, both at ProMedica and across the national healthcare landscape? Randy Oostra: 2012 felt like a long year be- cause of the massive amount of change happen - ing in healthcare. Nationally, there is a lot of un-certainty and acknowledgement that the current model is not sustainable. It's exciting, and I think some things we put in motion will provide suc - cess in coming years. From a ProMedica perspective, it was an ex- hausting year but one of the best, if not the best, years we've had based on our metrics. We did multiple things to prepare our staff for health-care reform. We did culture workshops where we used interactive sessions to prepare the staff on where we were in healthcare and how we needed to change. About 12,000 people went through those facilitated sessions. We also had our whole staff focus on patient satisfaction. We did a lot of work in IT last year. As a system, we had 30 major go-live events including physi - cian order entry. It's astonishing to do that many go-lives in one year. ProMedica was also selected by Medicare for the Shared Savings Program and our health plan was selected to be a state-wide provider of Medicaid. We also had some growth; we added physicians and added a hospital last year. Q: As someone who has been with Pro- Medica since 1997, how do you think that longevity affects your leadership style?RO: Longevity can be good and bad. The good part is that it allows for perspective. As you have longevity in careers and institutions, you gain a perspective and a balance. Our team has been together for a long time. Everyone understands their roles and responsibilities and knows what everyone is doing. In times like now, it's very ef - fective because you know people will do their job and take on their responsibilities. It's challenging to think about leading and facili- tating change in an institution because you have to work with the board and community to explain changes. Having familiarity helps in that area. It all gives you perspective. My 15 years here are help-ful as we think about the next decade. Q: You're a huge advocate for culture improvement. How has culture at Pro-Medica changed under your watch? RO: Culture is incredibly important, especially in times of change. We looked at incredible changes from financial pressures, electronic medical records, the [Patient Protection and] Af-fordable Care Act, ACOs and population health management expenses and workforce and re-cruitment issues. These are the times to step back and go to the basics of what we believe and [form] a sense of unity. When you look at culture, there are different cul - tures in the workforce, and they deal with life differently and different things motivate them. For example, cultural differences affect market - ing strategy. There are board members that like to look at the newspaper and want to be adver - tised there, and the young medical group wants social media marketing. If you have the same message for everyone, it doesn't work. We need to communicate and work with each group dif-ferently. If we don't do that, we won't be suc - cessful in healthcare. When you think about driving teamwork, working with physicians and sharing and navigating decision-making, we want to make sure everyone is together and go-ing about it similarly. Culture has a huge impact, and we focus on participation and making sure everyone gets an opportunity to voice their thoughts. We do that routinely through webcasts, and we also go on the road to different facilities where we talk with our staff. We make it a point to ask for input on every - thing we do, like evaluating our mission statement, values and strategic plan. We did that through an online survey, and we got great thoughts on what the staff would like to improve.We also do executive sessions during all of our board meetings and try to make sure people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts. During those, we focus on dialogue and communication. Those are the biggest things we've done over the last few years, having free-flowing communication. We coupled all of that with a huge push in em-ployee wellness. We want to show that healthcare organizations should be different from other or - ganizations in employee wellness. We sponsor programs for people to lose weight, and we offer fitness club membership for employees. We have signs that show nutrition for what we serve in our cafeteria and vending machines, and we got rid of sugary beverages. We also don't hire tobacco users. Some facilities now have stand-up desks. Instead of people sitting all day, we put in hundreds of these desks in the system's facilities so people can stand. The desks work well for people with back problems, and we've had a strong response. From a wellness perspective, we believe we have to have a role in doing things differently. We should be different and a model for health and well-being. All of these things are the right things to do for healthcare organizations. There has also been an emphasis on leadership development. We've been getting input from physicians and putting them on boards and in senior leadership positions. All that changes cul - ture from top-down to being based on participa - tion and teamwork. Strong Culture Can Lead to Lasting Change: Q&A With Randy Oostra, CEO of ProMedica By Heather Punke Randy Oostra13 Sign up for the COMPLIMENTARY Becker's Hospital Review CEO Report & CFO Report E-Weeklies at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 Q: \"Culture\" can really be an ambigu- ous term, encompassing a range of workplace issues. Where should a health system CEO start if he/she wants to drive serious, lasting improvement? RO: The first thing to think about is the direct im- pact culture has on change in healthcare. When cul- ture wasn't aligned with changes in the past, those changes failed. Culture is not a soft, fuzzy thing, but it's important when you think about what type of environment you want to create to work in. If you're interested in culture, start with conversa- tions. Get others' perspectives on employee, pa-tient, physician satisfaction. If the results are not where they should be, ask why, culturally, we're not doing the things we aspire to do. Start small, with a series of conversations, and see if your per - ceptions align with everyone else's. Talk to people, deal with misconceptions, and use that to address cultural issues in the organization. Q: What is it about healthcare that ex- cites you most right now?RO: It is a very interesting time to be in health-care. In some ways, it's very challenging, but it is still very, very exciting. When you begin to look at the need to change \u2014 the fact that health-care is not sustainable, a lot of people are get - ting added to Medicare and Medicaid and deal-ing with cost issues while providing high-quality care \u2014 the challenge alone is very exciting. One interesting thing is the advances we've seen, like the adoption of EMR and physician and nurse order entry and the fact that we're talking about ACOs and global issues of health. Ad-dressing community need and access is not dull by any means \u2014 it's very exciting. Who is better to solve the issue in the community than mis-sion-based, community-focused non-profits? It's a great opportunity for healthcare institutions to address community needs. At ProMedica, we became interested in per - sonal determinates of health, and specifically hunger as a health issue. When you look at the mission statement, [editor's note: ProMedica's mission statement is \"Our Mission is to im-prove your health and well-being\"] it doesn't mean we only take care of people in our four walls, we need to go outside our four walls to deal with health and well-being in the commu-nity. For example, we're working with Share our Strength's No Kid Hungry\u00ae campaign to help end childhood hunger in communities across the country. We're excited about it because it's a little non-traditional. It is something we feel excited about. Q: Any new Year's resolutions you can share? RO: I think any time you go through a lot of change and challenge, it's good to come back to focusing on what's important on a work and personal basis. Personally, mine is to have more balance in life over the next year. Profession-ally, it is to keep balance and take time to step back and think globally and strategically about the things we do. n Fred Savelsbergh is not a typical CFO in today's hospital and healthcare industry. Since he graduated from North Texas State Uni - versity in 1982 with a double major in account - ing and economics, Mr. Savelsbergh has worked at Baylor Health Care System, based in Dallas. He worked his way up from staff accountant to CFO, a position he has held since 2009. It's rare for a person to stick with one organiza - tion throughout his or her professional life these days, but Mr. Savelsbergh says he has enjoyed ev - ery second of it. A major reason he's found per - sonal satisfaction at Baylor is because he works for an employer with similar values to his own \u2014 and he also happens to be in a position that demands vast amounts of change, which always keeps things interesting. Here, Mr. Savelsbergh talks about his tenure at Baylor, how the healthcare system has evolved during his time there and what ideas hospital and health system CFOs need to encourage if they want their organizations to be successful in an era of big data and quality outcomes. Question: You've been with one em- ployer for your entire professional ca-reer. That experience is few and far be-tween these days. How have you been able to maintain such a long, stable tenure at Baylor Health Care System?Fred Savelsbergh: The foundation of why I feel so good is based on my values and how those values fall in line with Baylor. Couple that with an organization that has $5.4 billion in total assets and a multitude of business models, and [consequently] there are different opportunities for advancement. Baylor also devotes a lot of time in succession planning. [Baylor Health Care System Vice Presi-dent of Corporate Finance] Kitty Mann, one of the people who hired me in 1982, is one of those people who has been there to shepherd my ca-reer along, and there's been others as well. [Baylor Health Care System President and CEO] Joel Al-lison is the person I get a lot of inspiration from. So here you have an organization with great values that I identify with, an organization that is diverse in business units that allow career growth, succes-sion planning with a vested interest and mentor - ing that helps you demonstrate your ability. Q: You're in a unique position in that you've seen the evolution and progres-sion of the U.S. healthcare system over the past 30 years through the lens of one organization. Can you describe this sys-temic progression you've witnessed? FS: When I first came to Baylor, it actually had only one other affiliated hospital besides Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. [There are now 30 hospitals owned, operated, joint ven-tured or affiliated with Baylor Health Care Sys - tem.] It was a very small healthcare system. If you think about where healthcare was in 1982, it was talked about in the purest sense of busi-ness, as it was just starting to develop a hub-and-spoke strategy. We did this through years of rela-tionships with other community medical centers. That, in and of itself, is quite remarkable. Finding Value in Your Organization: Q&A With Baylor Health CFO Fred Savelsbergh By Bob Herman Fred Savelsbergh14 Sign up for the COMPLIMENTARY Becker's Hospital Review CEO Report & CFO Report E-Weeklies at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 Now think about where healthcare is going \u2014 focusing on the continuum of care, so a hospital is more like a short-stay urgency center. But at the center of everything we do are patients. We have to think about the continuum of care and all those stops on the continuum of care. It's about chronic disease management and primary care medical homes, in particular. Our Health- Texas Provider Network is an example of that with more than 600 physicians and extenders. Q: As you mentioned, Baylor Health Care System has grown significantly over the past several decades, even the past sev-eral years. Mergers and acquisitions are becoming more prominent than ever be- fore. How do you see this evolving in the short term, and how big of a role should CFOs have in the M&A process? FS: Consolidation is going to continue to occur on the provider side \u2014 and it is happening on the payor side, too. Size and scale can be a shock absorber when you're managing transition risk, and you have to have balance sheet strength. Days cash on hand is an example of [an impor - tant metric to watch]. Baylor Health Care System is in a highly com- petitive environment, and the reason why we have such a diversity of business models at this point in time is although the market has settled down, the national healthcare environment hasn't. There are more changes coming in 2014 [due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]. For example, our state government has said it will decline participation in the Medicaid expansion. What is that going to look like? Those are busi-ness models that have to be evaluated, and we are doing that. But right now, there are still too many unknowns to define further M&A movement. Q: Texas Gov. Rick Perry, as you said, has indicated Texas will not expand its Medicaid program. Essentially for hospitals and health systems in Texas, and other states declining Medicaid expansion, this means continued un-compensated care for patients who could have at least received Medicaid coverage. Texas will also not design its own health insurance exchange. What are your thoughts on how Texas is han-dling the big PPACA elements? FS: When the [PPACA] was passed, Texas had the highest rate of uninsured people. The ex-changes and Medicaid expansion would provide an option for the uninsured, and it would help the situation in Texas. There are significant healthcare access issues in Texas that have to be addressed. I think this whole situation around exchanges will come down to benefit design. What are the payments to physicians and to providers who take exchange patients? If I look at it right now, only 37 percent of physicians in Texas take Med- icaid, and 70 percent said they will take Medi- care. This is a big concern for the state of Texas. Q: If there's one important point you'd like to relay to other hospital and health system CFOs out there, what would it be? FS: One is cost structure. It's really where pay - ments are going. It's about managing transition risk between the top line and cost base and trying to maintain that parity between where the top line is changing and pulling costs out of the organization. One example is our STEEEP governance coun- cil, which stands for safe, timely, effective, ef - ficient, equitable and patient-centered care. We have brought together myself, our CMO, COO, chief quality officer, chief safety officer and clinicians, and we look at the finance, quality and clinical care from an efficiency standpoint. That's one of the structures we're looking at for our Medicare break-even strategy. Basically, we're trying to right-size the cost struc - ture to where we think the puck is going to be, and we want to take $680 million in costs out of Baylor Health Care System over a five-year period. We are in our third year of the journey. We re-evaluate this every year as part of our stra-tegic financial budgeting process. We also track it on a monthly basis and then we measure wheth - er we are accomplishing our goals. Q: Any final thoughts as we head into 2013? FS: Over the last 10 years, there have been a lot of acquisitions of freestanding ASCs and short- stay hospitals. We are doing acquisitions as well. With that growth, it will be highly competitive, but you have to invest in those new models. Back to the STEEEP committee, Baylor Health Care System made a decision to establish a qual- ity institute to look to the future and look at big data. Through [Baylor's Chief Quality Of- ficer] David Ballard, MD, PhD, a large group of physicians and others, they can analyze our data and quality outcomes. That is part of how you compete in the future. You need to have data to continuously improve your organization and prove your outcomes. That was something Bay - lor invested in years ago, and we are in a position to capitalize on that. And I'll leave you with this \u2014 providers have to find a financing vehicle. In order to compete, you have to have a financing vehicle because that gives you another source of big data. Q: When you say \"find a financing ve- hicle,\" do you mean hospitals should start their own health insurance plans? FS: They could start a health plan, acquire a health plan or partner with the payor. Why is that important? Because you'll be responsible for bundled payments, or any variation of capi-tation or payments based on outcomes. Having a financing vehicle and having covered lives is very important form a competitive advantage standpoint. n REGISTER TODAY!

The hospital's cancer program has retained its accreditation by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer since 1986. Aventura (Fla.) Hospital & Medical Center. The Aventura Comprehensive Cancer Center is recognized by the American College of Surgeons as a Comprehen - sive Community Cancer Program. The headquarters of the Columbia Cancer Research Network, a hospital-based research organization that offers clinical trials, are located in the cancer center, which bolsters physi - cians' access to cancer research and the advancement of prevention. The center also provides patients with a cancer care coordinator, who is an oncology social worker, to assist them through the care continuum and navigate the center's various support services. Banner Gateway Medical Center (Gilbert, Ariz.). In September 2011, Banner Health formed an af-filiation with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston to open the Banner MD Anderson Cancer Center, which is located on the Ban-ner Gateway campus. The center acts as a cancer hub in Arizona, combining clinical treatments with access to MD Anderson's renowned research. A multidisci - plinary clinic acts as the cancer center's core. There, physicians from all cancer specialties collaborate and streamline patients' diagnoses, consultations and treat - ment plan development. Barnes-Jewish Hospital (St. Louis). Researchers and physicians at the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine care for more than 8,000 newly di-agnosed cancer patients each year. Patients have access to more than 250 therapeutic clinical studies at the cen - ter, as well as services in a state-of-the-art outpatient facility on the hospital campus. Siteman Cancer Center is the only site of its kind in the state to hold Compre - hensive Cancer Center designation from the National Cancer Institute, which it received in 2001. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston). The cancer center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center is aligned with Harvard Medical School, allow - ing patients access to some of the most innovative di-agnostic procedures and therapies. The center offers roughly 140 clinical trials and recently conducted trials that led to FDA approval for therapies for melanoma and metastatic renal cancer. Beth Israel's cancer pro - gram is the only one in Massachusetts and one of 34 in the country to receive the Outstanding Achievement Award from the American College of Surgeons Com-mission on Cancer. Boca Raton (Fla.) Regional Medical Center. The Eugene M. & Christine E. Lynn Cancer Institute, one of the largest cancer centers in South Florida, is ac-credited as a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the American College of Surgeons. More than 20 oncology physicians at the center treat upwards of 3,000 cancer patients each year. The institute includes the Morgan Pressel Center for Cancer Genetics, where specialists determine if an individual has a hereditary predisposi-tion to certain types of cancer. The institute also uses the latest imaging technology, such as helical computer - ized tomography or spiral CT, to detect lung masses at their earliest and potentially most curable stage. Boone Hospital Center (Columbia, Mo.).

Established in 2010, the center includes 12 cancer care locations across the Carolinas and also provides patients with access to cutting-edge research. The Levine Cancer Institute recently re - located to a new state-of-the-art facility that fea-tures nine cancer clinics, infusion therapy, radia-tion therapy, palliative care and a Phase I clinical trials center under one roof. Cedars Sinai Medical Center (Los Angeles). The Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer In- stitute at Cedars Sinai offers patients a hub mod-el comprised of multidisciplinary teams. Tumor boards, organized by specific types of cancer, help patients design treatment plans. Patients also have access to Cedars Sinai's 24-hour outpa-tient cancer center, which treats more than 9,000 patients each year. The center is home to basic oncology research, along with clinical trials. In October, it launched a project in partnership with Balitmore-based Johns Hopkins Medicine that allows all men diagnosed with prostate can-cer to have their disease tracked in a secure and interactive online patient portal. Christiana Care Health System (Wilmington, Del.). Christiana Care's Helen F. Graham Cancer Center takes a multidisciplinary, team-based ap-proach to cancer care, in which each patient meets with a nurse navigator and team of cancer special-ists in consultation with primary care physicians. The center was one of the first to be selected for the National Cancer Institute Community Cen-ters Program. A collaboration with the University of Delaware helped the Graham Cancer Center expand to include its Center for Translational Re - search, which includes a familial cancer registry. Christus Santa Rosa Hospital (San Antonio). The cancer program at Christus Santa Rosa Hos- pital provides inpatient and outpatient services for patients, driven by multidisciplinary teams of oncologists, hospitalists, registered nurses, dieticians, social workers, physical therapists and chaplains. The hospital has a Center of Excel - lence for High Dose Biotherapy Interluekin-2, which is a protein found naturally in the body that stimulates the immune system, which in turn kills cancer cells.

The independent New Hampshire Center for Public Policy found that average compensation of state non-profit hospital CEOs grew by roughly 18 percent between 2006 and 2009, which was much higher than the growth of private sector wages. For-profit hospital companies also made news after public records showed CEOs at the largest operators made anywhere between $3.7 million and $21.6 million in total compensation in 2011. Hospitals and health systems have a lot on their plates, from healthcare reform initiatives to ensuring their balance sheets will be black in the next quarter. Adjusting executive compensation packages has made its way into those discussions as well, and innovative organizations are continually as- sessing whether and how to incorporate the latest practices. As hospitals and health systems look to stay at the forefront of innova- tive and reasonable compensation packages for their executives, here are eight trends regarding healthcare executive compensation based on expert analysis within the field. 1. Executive compensation arrangements will be simpler. Several years ago, it was common for hospital and health system execu - tives to have elaborate compensation agreements, which were built and constructed by the board's compensation committee. However, organiza - tions are ditching contracts with confusing language and complex bonuses, incentives and benefits. \"Hospitals are getting away from 'smorgasbord' compensation,\" says Tom Flannery, PhD, partner with consulting firm Mercer. \"The reason is the design of those types of compensation programs can be very complex, making administration cumbersome.\" Dr. Flannery explains there is another reason why compensation arrangements no longer look like labyrinths: Hospitals have to explain their rationale for com- pensating executives, and having straightforward contracts with easy-to-discern goals makes their community or investor relations job much simpler. \"It's easier to explain a simpler program than a complex program,\" Dr. Flannery says. \"Quite often, organizations have to explain their compen- sation program to one, or even all, of four parties: the IRS, the attorney general, the newspaper or their own employees. The simpler the program, the more efficient and effective the explanation is.\" 2. performance, not just market data, will influence pay levels. Similar to last year , hospitals and health systems are no longer relying solely on market-based salary data to construct executive compensation contracts. Salary and total cash compensation are still largely determined by mar - ket percentiles, comparisons to similar-sized institutions and other factors shown in compensation firm studies and surveys, but \"pay-for-perfor - mance\" data are also becoming more inculcated into routine. For example, CEOs may be paid in part for achieving certain patient satisfaction scores or maintaining physician relationships. \"The essential structures of executive compensation have not changed sub- stantially,\" says Deedra Hartung, senior executive vice president and manag-ing director of Cejka Executive Search. \"But healthcare reform is changing the goals and objectives that incentives are tied to as the system moves away from volume-based to value-based payment models. For example, metrics based on the degree of physician alignment would play a greater role.\" Dr. Flannery adds that hospitals must also justify how they choose their market data for executive compensation. For example, if a hospital wants to pay the CEO in the highest compensation brackets, the performance must justify decision. \"If you're going to be paid at the 75th percentile, you have to demon- strate 75th percentile performance,\" Dr. Flannery says. \"There is much more pressure on making sure there is a causal relationship between pay and performance.\" Consequently, boards are more likely to have clearer expectations in their compensation meetings, and objectives are more likely to be focused on quality of care, safety, patient satisfaction, physician satisfaction, employee satisfaction, reputational image and cost of care efficiency. 3. Compensation for health system CEOs will routinely hit sev- en figures. According to Mercer's 2012 integrated health networks com- pensation survey, hospital and health system presidents and CEOs continue to record the highest salaries and cash compensation totals in the industry. Health system presidents and CEOs continue to make the most of any C-level position. Health systems that want to pay their CEOs in the 75th percentile are looking at a total compensation package around $1.46 mil- lion. Health system CEOs in the 25th percentile are making just shy of seven figures at $982,800, according to the survey. Standalone hospital CEOs are also seeing high pay totals, but their total compensation usually does not exceed the $1 million benchmark. Stand- alone hospital CEOs at organizations with more than $500 million in an- nual revenue \u2014 some of the highest earners at standalone hospitals \u2014 earned roughly $962,600 in the 75th percentile for 2012. Across all-sized organizations in Mercer's survey, standalone hospital presidents and CEOs still made $480,000 in the 25th percentile.Hospital and Health System Executive Compensation in 2013: 8 Trends to Monitor (continued from page 1) Job Title Organizational Number of Market base salary percentile Market total cash compensation percentile Scope Incumbents 25th 50th 75th 25th 50th 75th System President & CEO All Organizations 78 $787,300 $917,500 $1,028,100 $912,300 $1,131,600 $1,405,700 Standalone $480,000 $613,500 $750,800 $518,500 $620,000 $210,300 $155,000 $187,500 $362,400 $250,700 $324,400 $171,800 $227,700 $335,000 $946,800 $1,060,600 $510,900 $310,800 Compensation Section 4. Compensation for critical C-suite positions will climb, too. While presidents and CEOs take home the biggest paydays at hospitals and health systems, other executive positions are holding steady with six-figure payouts. CFOs, CIOs and CNOs at high-grossing hospitals and systems normally make between $340,000 and $650,000. Mercer's analysis examined compensation data for 2012 for three non- CEO hospital executive positions: CFO, CIO and CNO. CFOs at hospitals and health systems with more than $1 billion in total revenue earned any-where from $310,800 to $649,300 \u2014 the highest of the three non-CEO positions studied at the largest of health systems. Even across all orga-nizations, CFOs can expect to record total cash compensation between $171,800 and $335,000. However, CIOs actually made more than CFOs, on average, across all- sized organizations. Total cash compensation for CIOs ranged from $250,700 in the 25th percentile to $415,400 in the 75th percentile. Base salaries reached as high as $362,400 for CIOs across various-sized hospitals and health systems. For chief nursing executives, salaries and total cash compensation are among the lowest of non-CEO executive positions. However, depend-ing on the size of the hospital or health system, CNOs could earn up to $340,300. Middle-of-the-road salaries for CNOs hover between $171,700 and $236,600, while total cash compensation for CNOs in the 50th per - centile could hit anywhere between $187,500 and $282,800, according to Mercer's survey. 5. Retaining key talent will be an element of many compensa- tion programs. In order to keep highly qualified executives and prevent turnover during a hectic period of reform, many systems are installing re-tention devices in their compensation plans. For example, Dr. Flannery says hospitals may award a CEO a bonus of 30 percent of base pay, if all performance criteria are met. However, half of the bonus may be paid immediately, while the other half may be de - ferred over five years. That could scatter tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of dollars over several years, and if the CEO left during the deferment period, the bonus may be forfeited. This may make someone reconsider before leaving, Dr. Flannery says. Michael Dunford, executive vice president and managing principal at Cejka Executive Search, agrees. He says some of the most forward-thinking and innovative compensation contracts he has seen involve \"attractive, perfor - mance-based, deferred packages that are meaningful and tie in retention\" in order to receive full value. 6. Perks are becoming a thing of the past. Steven Slutsky, JD, di- rector and executive compensation consultant in PwC's Philadelphia office, says many popular perquisites of the past are quickly on the decline now, even more so than last year. Cars, country club dues, home office equipment, spousal travel and others are fading away due to their negative perception. Instead, hospitals and health systems are rolling perquisites into total cash compensation, which hospitals can more easily defend. \"[Giving out perquisites] can look horrible: You're giving the CEO an auto- mobile, but not employees? Don't executives make enough to pay for their own car?\" Dr. Flannery says. \"Organizations do not want the distraction of those arguments. Have compensation that is appropriate, competitive and reflects the performance of the individual executive as well as the collective performance of the executive team.\" 7. Executives behind CEOs will be in high demand \u2014 and compensation will follow. Dr. Flannery explains that as healthcare reform continues to chug along, there are still only a select group of hos-pital and health system CEOs that have helped initiate major projects, like accountable care organizations. \"If you think about the organizations that have already done that, the CEO is probably not going to leave in the middle of the project,\" he says. However, executives who are second- or third-in-command, such as the COO or CFO, who have successfully helped with ACOs and other health-care reform efforts have created a new market for themselves. \"Those people now become in high demand because they have demonstrat - ed the skills to do all the complex work that is necessary, and they have the hands-on experience,\" Dr. Flannery says. \"There's likely to be a bump in their compensation, particularly for those who have demonstrated success.\" 8. Physician executives will continue to attract unique com- pensation packages. Because hospital executives will increasingly be paid on value and performance rather than market rates and profitability alone, there is one subset of executives that may have an advantage in terms of experience: physician executives. Physicians who have turned to the C-suite may already be very familiar with value-based purchasing, as well as inner workings of an organization's clini-cal setting, and this places a premium dollar on their availability. \"Physician executives with experience and working knowledge of various payor contracting systems have been in high demand and are well-positioned for senior leadership roles,\" says Paul Esselman, executive vice president and managing principal at Cejka Executive Search. \"In this environment, those physician executives with the 'triple-threat' skills and experience in clinical practice, system engagement and managed care administration are in a unique position to tie the clinical outcomes to reimbursement, thereby maximizing their value and compensation opportunity.\" n 26 Special Compensation Section As hospitals work to integrate their ser - vices, shrink their total cost of care, raise patient satisfaction and drop their readmissions, employing or aligning with physi - cians of all specialties are in hospitals' sights. Staying knowledgeable on competitive compen- sation trends is important for health systems to be able to attract the talent and services they need to grow and improve, while ensuring com-pensation is appropriate to maximize financial resources. Although a few specialties experi-enced big pay increases over the last year, several median base salaries saw slight declines. Highest-paid specialties Cardiac and surgical specialties top the list for highest median compensation. Orthopedic, car - diac and thoracic surgeons and invasive cardiolo - gists polled had median salaries above $500,000, according to data from the American Medical Group Association's 2012 Medical Group Com-pensation and Financial Survey, based on 2011 data. Specialists with compensation of $400,000 and up also included diagnostic radiologists, non-invasive cardiologists, gastroenterologists and urologists. Dermatologists earned lowed closely by otolaryngologists, ophthalmol - ogists and general surgeons, with median base salaries at $370,000 and higher. Few specialties can hold a candle, however, to neurosurgeons, whose average starting salary is a whopping $669,000. Lowest-paid specialties Primary care physicians such as pediatricians and hospitalists continued to be paid much less than many other specialties, but psychiatrists held the lowest median base pay at $217,194, according to the AMGA report. Also low on the list were endocrinologists, non-surgical neurologists, ne-phrologists and rheumatologists, all with salaries between $219,000 and $277,000. Other trends Overall, the weighted average compensation growth for all types of physicians was 2.8 per - cent between 2010 and 2011. Primary care in-creased an average of 4 percent, surgeon pay grew 3.4 percent and other specialties climbed 2.8 percent. Hematologists and medical oncologist compen- sation exploded with a 7.13 percent boost, and nephrologist pay skyrocketed 6.99 percent. Fam-ily medical physicians' paychecks leaped 5.13 percent. But some specialties took a hit, namely endocri-nologists at a 4.98 percent drop, and intervention-al and non-interventional diagnostic radiologists at 1.39 percent and 0.45 percent, respectively. Ad-ditionally, rheumatologists' pay fell 1.09 percent and otolaryngologists' decreased 0.81 percent. Physician statistics \u2014 2013 Compiled from the most recent market research data available, here are 169 statistics on physi - cian compensation trends over the last year. Data from 27 specialties includes median base salary (without bonuses), highest and lowest of- fered base salaries, median growth from 2011, median work RVUs, median gross charges and female physician pay as a percentage of male physician pay. Note: Some of the statistics may seem higher or lower compared with others in each specialty. A collection of physician surveys was used to compile information. In ad-dition, every specialty does not contain the same number of statistics, as some data was not available for each spe - cialty. Please read the following to understand where the statistics came from: Median salary, salary growth from 2011, work RVUs and gross charges are from the American Medical Group Association's 2012 Medical Group Compensation and Financial Survey, a 2012 report based on 2011 data. The survey collected responses from 225 medical groups that represent approximately 55,800 providers in total during the first quarter of 2012. An exception to this is the data for neurosurgeons, which was not included in the AMGA's report. The median salary and salary growth from 2011 statistics for neurosurgeons were taken from the Medicus Firm's 2012 Physician Compen-sation Survey , which collected responses from 2,582 physicians between April and May 2012. Female pay as a percentage of male pay was calculated using data from Medscape's 2012 Physician Com-pensation Report. The report collected responses from 24,216 U.S. physicians across 25 specialty areas from Feb. 1, 2012, to Feb. 17, 2012. Highest offered base salary and lowest offered base salary are from Merritt Hawkins' 2012 Review of Physi - cian Recruiting Incentives. The report is based on 2,710 permanent physician and advanced allied profes - sional search assignments that Merritt Hawkins engaged in to conduct during the 12-month period from April 2011 to March 2012. Employed and independently contracted medical direc - tor median hourly rates are from Integrated Healthcare Strategies' Medical Director Survey: 2011 Report . The survey collected data from 159 healthcare organiza-tions representing 3,200 medical directors during the first quarter of 2011.Anesthesiologists Median salary: $377,375Median salary growth from

hospital-employed physi - cians have become a burning topic in recent years, mostly due to the upsurge in hospitals acquiring physician practices and subse - quent employment of physicians. Today, roughly 25 percent of all specialty physicians who see patients at hos- pitals are employed \u2014 a sizable increase from the 5 percent of specialists who were hospital-employed in 2000. The number of employed primary care physicians has doubled to roughly 40 percent during the same time span. As more physicians become hospital and health system employees, it has become paramount to tackle the sometimes difficult process of bench-marking physician pay. In 2010, the MGMA-ACMPE reported the 25 high-est-paid specialties among hospital-employed physicians included orthope-dic surgeons, spine surgeons, neurosurgeons, cardiovascular surgeons and specialty pediatric surgeons, among others. The salaries of those 25 high- paid specialties ranged from a low of $465,543 for dermatologists to a high of $714,088 for orthopedic spine surgeons. With those figures in mind, here are seven trends regarding hospital-em-ployed physician compensation that have emerged over the past several years. 1. For physicians, earning power is greater in a hospital- based setting than private practice. Tom Flannery, PhD, partner with consulting firm Mercer, says there is a general belief in the healthcare environment that physicians in private practice can earn higher incomes than those who decide to become hospital employees. However, that may not always be the case, he says. After factoring out malpractice costs, health insurance, overhead and other operating expenses, Dr. Flannery believes hospital employment offers great - er earning potential for physicians, especially those looking for more stability. \"When everything is considered, including the hassles of running your own practice, the earning power [physicians] have can actually be higher in a hospital-based practice,\" Dr. Flannery says. \"But there's still a perception that private practice physicians can earn more. [That] is more to do with the freedom to act as opposed to earning power.\"7 Trends in Hospital-Employed Physician Compensation By Bob Herman 29 Special Compensation Section 2. High-paid specialties to watch in- clude noninvasive cardiology, ophthal general orthopedic surgery, neonatal medicine pediatrics and neu-rosurgery. Mercer recently completed its 2012 Highly Compensated Physician Survey, which collected salary and cash compensation data for the highest-paid employed physician specialties. Mercer analysts highlighted five specialties in particular: noninvasive cardiology, ophthalmol - ogy, general orthopedic surgery, neonatal - cine pediatrics and neurosurgery. Of those five hospital-based specialties, oph- thalmologists recorded some of the highest pay packages. Total cash compensation of hospital-employed ophthalmologists in the 75th percentile averaged $779,290, according to the survey. Neuro-surgeons recorded the next-highest total compen-sation average in the 75th percentile at $778,890. In the 50th percentile, all five specialties aver - aged more than $500,000 in base salary alone. Here are market base salary averages in the 50th percentile 3. Benefits for physicians mirror the general hospital employee base, not the C-suite. Physicians who are added to the hospi- tal payroll are increasing the hospital's operating expenses with higher benefit plan costs. However, Pat Kopacz, principal at Mercer, says Mercer's Highly Compensated Physician Survey showed most physicians \u2014 even those who become heads of a service line or department \u2014 receive the same health benefit plans and retirement op-tions as nurses, frontline staff and other frontline hospital employees. The hospital's executive team usually has its own benefit program, she says. 4. Hospitals are emphasizing value over productivity. In order to combat increased financial pressures such as the aforementioned boost in benefit plan costs, hospitals have tradi-tionally encouraged higher levels of productivity. However, the fee-for-service environment is be-coming a thing of the past. Focusing on volume is not a silver bullet in an increasingly value-based environment, but at the same time, hospitals cannot just \"let physicians do what they want in terms of productivity,\" Dr. Flannery says. Therefore, in compensation plans, hospitals are incentivizing physicians to focus their energy and efforts on high-level cases instead of \"churning numbers.\" Instead, advanced practice clinicians, such as nurse practitioners and physician assis-tants, are helping with simpler cases, a process that has boosted their compensation as well. \"Physicians have to practice at the top of their skill level, and that's not happening,\" Dr. Flan-nery says. \"When we see physicians operating at the top of their skill level, pediatricians aren't seeing strep throat and ear infections \u2014 those are being seeing by nurse practitioners. There-fore, nurse practitioners need to operate at the top of their skill level, too. When the value goes up, compensation goes up, and it frees up time for more complicated cases [for physicians].\" 5. Hospital-affiliated primary care phy- sicians will eventually see their salaries increase more. Primary care is a major em - phasis within the healthcare reform law, and Dr. Flannery predicts primary care physicians will receive higher pay in the process. For example, in November , CMS released a final rule that said primary care physicians in the spe - cialties of family medicine, general internal med - icine or pediatric medicine (and related subspe - cialties) will be paid Medicare rates for Medicaid primary care services for this year and 2014. In addition, qualifying physicians will receive higher payments if primary care services are rendered by certain physician extenders \u2014 such as nurse practitioners \u2014 who work under the qualifying physicians' supervision. \"The literature is starting to say there's going to be a change in the economics. We're going to see an increase in primary care physician com-pensation because the value of primary care is high now and will be higher over the next several years,\" Dr. Flannery says. Dr. Flannery adds that specialists will still remain in high demand and command high salaries due to a general shortage of physicians and the fact that \"unhealthy nations are going to need car - diologists, orthopedists and neurosurgeons left and right.\" 6. The highest-paid physicians at hos- pitals have the highest expectations, especially those in administrative roles. Ms. Kopacz says hospital-employed physicians who earn the most \u2014 such as CMOs, depart - ment heads and other physicians who have addi-tional administrative roles \u2014 have higher expec - tations now. If a physician is making more than $700,000 per year and is a department chair, for example, he or she will be expected to maintain clinical quality and also become a \"manager\" who helps operate the department. \"Physicians are [being] asked to play multiple roles within an organization \u2014 not just clini-cal, but administrative as well,\" Ms. Kopacz says. \"That's something we expect to see more and more. Physicians are going to have to be clini-cal leaders as well as part of the administration.\" 7. Compensation arrangements be- tween hospitals and physicians involve quid pro quo elements. Although some may view compensation negotiations between hospitals and physicians as a Wild West show - down, that is generally not the trend, Dr. Flan-nery says. Both sides usually are open to a \"this for that\" mentality. Of course, hospitals must pay physicians fair market value, but there are certain quid pro quo elements. For example, physicians will receive various benefits outlined in the hospital benefit plan, but it may not be as extensive as benefit plans in other industries. Dr. Flannery views that situation as hospitals offering a perk that physi - cians may not have had before, and although it's not as much as other industries, physicians will not have to be on call 24/7, as they would be in private practice. Another example is tuition and student loan forgiveness. A hospital may offer a physician a sizable sum of money to help pay down medi - cal school loans, but the hospital may ask that physician to commit to work at the hospital for a predetermined amount of time. \"Think about the economics of having to recruit physicians,\" Dr. Flannery says. \"You have to pay a headhunter, pay relocation, get [physicians] to productive levels \u2014 you're talking potentially the equivalent of 12 to 24 months compensa-tion. It's a short payment to give them a couple hundred thousand [in student loan forgiveness] to have them agree to stay for five to seven years and not having turnover every two years.\" n Specialty Market base Market total cash salary percentile compensation percentile 25th 50th 75th are preparing for the reality of the post-re - form environment that will require hospitals and physicians to be more accountable for the delivery of higher quality and more efficient care delivered at a lower cost. As hospitals and physicians navigate through the challenges of planning for this future, they also have to remain focused on current operations that are threatened by thinning margins due to an increased cost structure and reimbursement declines in the current fee-for-service environment. To effectively position for the future realities of healthcare while maintain- ing focus on current operations, many hospitals and physicians are turning to clinical integration as a viable option to (1) increase quality, (2) reduce cost and waste in the current system to maintain margins, (3) sustain inde-pendence for physicians not ready for hospital employment and (4) posi-tion providers to take on higher levels of accountability to effectively man-age utilization and the health of populations in the future. CI is commonly defined as a health network working together, using prov- en protocols and measures, to improve patient care, decrease cost and dem - onstrate value to the market. Once the CI network can demonstrate a value proposition, payors and large employers are approached to support the network and other incentives that are based on achieving defined results. In most cases, CI networks and the initial conversations with payors are initiated by health systems. However, to be successful, CI networks must become physician-led, professionally managed organizations. Organizations should keep the Federal Trade Commission's clinical inte - gration definition and requirements in mind during CI program develop- ment and implementation. In 1996, the Department of Justice and the FTC defined CI as an active and ongoing program to evaluate and modify practice patterns by the CI network's physician participants and create a high degree of interdependence and cooperation among the physicians to control costs and ensure quality. Generally, the FTC considers a program to be clinically integrated if it performs the following: 1. Establishes mechanisms to monitor and control utilization of healthcare services that are designed to control costs and ensure quality of care. 2. Selectively chooses CI network physicians who are likely to further these efficiency objectives. 3. Utilizes investment of significant capital, both monetary and human, in the necessary infrastructure and capability to realize the claimed efficiencies. 7 Components To effectively implement CI, the network should understand the relevance and the possible options for each of the seven components discussed below. 30 Physician-Hospital Relationships & ACOs FEATUREThe 7 Components 31 Physician-Hospital Relationships & ACO 1. Legal options. To legally implement CI, the health system and physi - cians are required to organize in a structure that supports program objec - tives. With the exception of an employment-only model, a CI network can primarily be created within a (an): Physician-hospital organization \u2014 A joint venture between a health system and its medical staffs. Independent practice association \u2014 Owned and operated by only physician partners. Subsidiary of the health system \u2014 The health system is the sole cor - porate member of the subsidiary entity and member physicians sign separate legal agreements to participate. Traditionally these structures have been used to negotiate and handle man-aged care contracts (HMO, fee-for-fervice, etc.) for a defined network of providers and they are now being utilized as the vehicle to implement CI networks by achieving the following objectives: Establishing a network of providers that enables enhanced coordina - tion of care. Creating a new partnership model with employed and independent physicians that includes defined roles for physician leadership. Defining performance improvement initiatives to provide demon-strated value to the market. Providing a platform for joint contracting to support care redesign and performance improvement initiatives. Negotiating with potential partners for risk-based contracts. Each legal option is capable of achieving these CI objectives and they differ in ownership structure and capitalization requirements. Some hospitals and physicians already have a PHO or IPA in place and are using those entities as the foundation for their CI programs. For example, a four-hospital sys - tem in the Midwest chose to utilize a PHO as their vehicle for CI because the business entity was already created. Although the infrastructure was not entirely created to support a fully-functioning CI network, the PHO created an opportunity for ownership, access to resources, strong public perception and the analytics staff to support quality programs. However, to limit physician costs while still allowing physicians to have a significant leadership role in the network, a four-hospital system in the southeast cre - ated a subsidiary of the health system to launch its program. 2. Physician leadership. Integration in the post-reform era requires a high degree of physician-hospital alignment that is based on trust and transparency. Health systems willing to pursue CI must empower physician leaders to have an influence on the future direction of the CI network. This will help to integrate the physician's clinical expertise into hospital operations and also increase cooperation and credibility of the CI network. Furthermore, dedicated physicians and administrative leadership will be re-quired to successfully implement a major change project of this magnitude. A vital step to physician engagement and leadership is a robust communi-cation strategy across the network and its partners. Clear goals and objec - tives by both employed and independent physicians will encourage dia-logue and partnership formation as the strategy is implemented. Once the CI network is created, a governance structure should be devel - oped. Physician leaders should participate on the CI board and provide leadership to committees formed to achieve program objectives. Other participating physicians may lead and/or participate on sub-committees supported by the CI network or health system. CI committees may merge with existing committees in place within the health system (i.e., executive committee, quality committee and contracting committee). 3. Participation criteria. Member physicians or groups in the CI net - work must sign a participation agreement. This agreement outlines the ex- pectations and requirements for participation in the CI program. In the initial stages of the network, it is very critical that member physicians ad-here to program guidelines to help ensure that stated objectives are met and the network's value proposition is able to be demonstrated to the market. Recognizing this, one large CI network in the Southeast included informa- tion technology adoption in the participation criteria to ensure that the network was able to demonstrate the value of enhanced coordination be-tween providers following evidence-based guidelines. To ingrain IT uti - lization into the culture, not only did the CI network initially include IT adoption and utilization in the participation criteria, but the network also designated a portion of the performance incentive dollars to this area to increase compliance. As the network matures and the participation criteria is solidified into the cul- ture, incentive payments are not typically awarded for compliance. However, to keep physicians focused on program requirements, physician eligibility in the incentive program may be tied to meeting the participation criteria. Sample participation criteria include: Maintaining the appropriate IT infrastructure. Logging into the CI Network website to view network and individual performance. Compliance with clinical protocols and care pathways developed by the network. Participation in all network contracts. 4. Performance improvement. Clinical quality and operational im- provement projects are necessary components of a CI program. CI provides a vehicle that engages physicians in determining how quality is defined and measured. CI also allows physicians to take an active role in care redesign and protocol development to increase quality, more effectively manage costs, reduce variation and eliminate unnecessary waste within the delivery system. The performance initiatives span across specialties and sites of care. To achieve performance improvement, the CI network works to define baseline performance and identify areas where the network can demon-strate quality and operational efficiencies to the market. It is critical that physicians play an active role in selecting metrics for the performance im-provement initiatives. CI networks should select performance improve - ment initiatives based on the (1) feasibility of capturing sufficient data to monitor performance, (2) improvement opportunity, (3) payor, employer and/or hospital interest in the program and (4) the ability of participating physicians to impact the targeted metrics. Performance improvement initiatives can be complex and difficult to mon- itor effectively based on the sophistication of the network's IT system and the capacity of the network to manage multiple initiatives effectively. Rec - ognizing this, one large multi-hospital system in the Midwest implemented their initiatives in a phased approach over time and ensured that all metrics of a Clinical Integration Network By Dennis Butts, MBA, Michael Strilesky, Manager, and Matthew Fadel, MBA, MSM, Senior Associate, Dixon Hughes Goodman 32 Physician-Hospital Relationships & ACO were consistent across contracts. Individual metrics were then reevaluated and updated on an annual basis to help ensure that the initiatives continued to demonstrate the value of the network. Performance improvement initia-tives are typically developed in the following categories: Variance and cost reduction \u2014 Improving operational efficiencies. Clinical efficiency \u2014 Reducing avoidable, unproductive and duplica-tive services. Care redesign \u2014 Ensuring treatment in the most optimal setting and by the right provider. System optimization \u2014 Shifting focus to preventive care and popula - tion health. Patient experience \u2014Objective and meaningful comparisons be-tween providers of care. 5. Information technology. If you do not measure it, you cannot im- prove it. IT is the backbone of the CI network's value proposition and is critical to improving coordination and connectivity between providers of care. Early adopters of CI would manually input data and transfer informa-tion by Excel template report cards. Today the industry is inundated with tools to assist with monitoring and reporting the care provided to a patient. Since providers will be affected most by a change in technology, they must be heavily involved in choosing the correct vendor. Two types of data shar - ing sources being used most by hospitals are electronic health records and patient registries. However, health information exchanges are becoming more popular and could eventually become robust enough to support clini-cally integrated initiatives. An EHR is a medical record for a patient in a physician office, hospital, ancillary care facility or ambulatory care facility. The EHR is intended to replace paper-based patient records for recording encounter-based infor - mation on each patient who receives care from the provider entity and includes electronic: data entry, order entry, prescribing and transcription. A patient registry is a repository that holds clinical information specific to a disease, disease process, implant, drug, etc. A cancer registry is an example of a disease-specific database. The registry is intended to track (1) patients and their compliance with specific chronic disease- (or wellness-)based guidelines across populations, (2) physician compliance with those guidelines and (3) outcomes for specific interventions. A data registry differentiates itself by interfaces with multiple data sources to provide sufficient data at the point of care provided to a patient, which is why many CI networks are utilizing data registries as opposed to the electronic medical records approach. 6. Contracting options. The purpose of CI is to provide higher quality care. Creating a CI network for the sole purpose of negotiating better rates is not the purpose of CI. However, CI networks are rewarded for demon-strated value, which is defined as the highest quality care at the lowest cost. The CI network can contract with payors, employers or health systems. These contracts can range from a specific procedure to a population of patients. Many hospital systems have reported that payors are not requir - ing that CI contracts include downside risk for the network. A six-hospital system in the Southeast reported that a major payor has approached them with a contracting model that would reward their network for demonstrat - ed performance in the following ways: Premium base rates \u2014 Increased fee-for-service rates based on ex-pected performance. Performance incentives \u2014 Incentive payments made for perfor - mance improvement initiatives. Shared savings \u2014 Savings shared based on a reduction in the cost of care.Some hospitals have also contracted with their own CI network to realize cost saving opportunities and to more effectively manage cost within their own health plan. A hospital system in the Southwest has implemented this strategy. The savings that are generated by the network are shared to fund the CI program and to make distributions to member physicians. 7. Flow of funds. Calculation and distribution of CI incentives to phy - sicians and to the health system occur after performance is achieved. A distribution of funds will typically be realized through cost savings, quality and efficiency programs negotiated by the CI network and its partners. Funds are distributed based on meeting performance objectives and per - formance can be defined in a variety of ways. For example, some CI net - works reward simply for global network compliance of the CI agreement while other CI networks reward based on site (multiple hospital systems), specialty and individual performance. Regardless of how the funds flow to the members of the CI network, the methodology should be transparent and easy to understand. Key consider - ations for CI network distribution methodologies include: Distribute rewards based on measurable performance. Reduce complexity of distribution methodology. Increase transparency across the network. Conclusion Health systems and physicians are implementing CI networks across the nation to respond to changing healthcare dynamics that are holding provid-ers more accountable for quality and outcomes. Each CI network needs to create a disciplined approach to assessing and developing the key com-ponents of their network to create a sufficient value proposition for the health system, physicians, payors and employers. As CI becomes a strategic imperative in most markets, organizations should keep the following criti - cal success factors in mind to accelerate the implementation of a successful and sustainable CI network: Align your health system objectives with the CI vision and strategy to avoid conflicting messages in your market. Involve physician leaders in the CI development process to gain phy - sician buy-in for program objectives. Express a willingness to create a new partnership model with em - ployed and independent physicians that includes defined roles for physician leadership. Maintain systems that can track and monitor clinical data across the continuum of ambulatory, acute and post-acute services. Utilize a scaled approach to develop a comprehensive list of metrics that provide value to multiple stakeholders and positions the CI net - work for greater levels of accountability. Create an effective communication strategy across all stakeholders to increase understanding of the key issues of CI. Commit to approach payors in the market as a combined network. n Dennis Butts is a manager with Dixon Hughes Goodman, where he designs and imple - ments strategic business solutions for hospitals and large physician practices.

Mr. Fadel can be reached at matt.fadel@dhgllp.com.In the 1980s, Henry Hood, MD, decided it was time for his health system to make a change. The late Dr. Hood was a neurosurgeon and CEO of Danville, Pa.-based Geisinger Health System, then known as Geisinger Medical Cen-ter. During the 1980s, the United States began to unfurl its first wave of managed care \u2014 that is, coordinating patient care within a specific net - work in an attempt to improve quality and de - crease costs. Dr. Hood wanted to be part of the growing demonstration, which resulted in the formation of the Geisinger Health Plan. Duane Davis, MD, a board-certified internist and rheumatologist who now heads the Geis - inger Health Plan, says the health insurance arm was the beginning of Geisinger's own reform. \"Dr. Hood basically said to all of us, 'Managed care is the beginning, and the financing of care is changing. Healthcare delivery will change, and we really need to learn how to do this,'\" Dr. Davis recalls. \"If you look back on it now, it was pretty visionary. That's kind of how it started for us.\" A handful of health systems like Geisinger have successfully played the role of both provider and payor for the past 30-plus years, and it is one of the reasons President Barack Obama has herald-ed Geisinger as an exemplary system of health-care delivery. As healthcare reform continues to evolve, more hospitals and health systems are exploring the option of starting their own health plans and insurance divisions. But managing care as both provider and payor is no easy task \u2014 and taking the wrong steps could be detrimental to an organization. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from earlier decades? In the 1990s, managed care, which included HMOs, PPOs and other insurance vehicles, began to proliferate throughout the healthcare system. Managed care, for better or for worse, became synonymous with U.S. healthcare. Some hospitals and health systems hopped on the health insurance/HMO bandwagon right away and decided to try their own hand at start - ing a health plan. Geisinger, Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City, Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Kaiser Permanente in Oak-land, Calif., and University of Pittsburgh Medi-cal Center are some of the most notable systems with longstanding, successful health plans. However, not all hospital-based health plans lasted, as many could not back up the financial risks associated with health insurance. As the 2000s evolved, several hospitals began to divest their health insurance arms like they did with their physician practices. Now, under President Obama's Patient Protec - tion and Affordable Care Act, there is a renewed emphasis on managing the continuum of care with better quality and decreased costs. In some instances, such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments, hospitals will be viewed as provider, insurer and care manager. \"Through payment changes, the [PPACA] is creat - ing incentives for provider systems to manage the entire process of care,\" says Peter Weiss, MD, pres-ident of Concert Health Plan, which started offer - ing commercial group health insurance through the Florida Division of Adventist Health System in 2010. \"This is easier when the provider system is also the insurer and can align the incentives of all parties around the health of the member.\" Lisa Goldstein, an associate managing direc - tor at Moody's Investors Service, agrees, saying healthcare reform has inspired a renaissance of hospitals wanting to dip their toes back into the health insurer realm in order to comply with the goals of federal healthcare reform. \"Historically, we've seen this trend before,\" she says. \"[Healthcare] is a very cyclical industry. In the mid-1990s, many health systems became ver - tically integrated. The hospital was the core busi-ness, but management also decided to go into the insurance business like we're seeing today.\" However, in the 1990s, the practice of hospitals doubling as insurers was more experimental than anything else, especially as the healthcare system tried to grapple with the concept of managing and financing the care of select groups of people. Now, Ms. Goldstein says hospitals want to start their own health plans because healthcare re-form demands population health management \u2014 and what better way to manage the care of a population than by becoming that population's financing vehicle? Should Hospitals Start Their Own Health Plans? By Bob HermanFEATURE33 Finance, Revenue Cycle & ICD-10 Providers Becoming Payors34 Finance, Revenue Cycle & ICD-10 \"Revenue is under pressure, and healthcare reform is coming \u2014 that's a fact now,\" Ms. Goldstein says. \"In order to reduce costs and gain efficien - cies, many [hospitals] are exploring getting back into health insurance busi-ness, either on their own or with a well established health plan. It's back to the future with this.\" Knowing the pros and cons One of the clearest benefits for hospitals starting their own health plans is the alignment of goals associated with healthcare reform, as previously mentioned. If hospitals provide the care and finance the care, it makes the delivery process more efficient without having to deal with a third-party intermediary. Consequently, hospitals that add a health plan will generate more revenue, which allows for more reinvestment within the community, the system and a growing patient base. For example, Geisinger Health Plan, one of the nation's largest rural HMOs, covers more than 300,000 people and brings in roughly $1.3 billion in annual revenue to Geisinger Health System. Geis - inger Health Plan is somewhat of an exception, due to its longevity, but CEO Dr. Davis says the increase in revenue allows the health system to better \"re-engineer our care to get better outcomes.\" Daryl Tol, CEO of Florida Hospital Volusia/Flagler, which recently an- nounced it would launch its own health plan in 2014, says hospitals that offer health plans to their patients also keep care decisions more \"local.\" \"Healthcare is local, yet providers and patients often face mandates from insurance companies who are not local,\" Mr. Tol says. \"This initiative will help us keep healthcare decisions in our community.\" However, challenges associated with starting a health plan can also be daunting. Last November, Fountain Valley, Calif.-based MemorialCare Health System announced it will launch its own health plan, Seaside Health Plan. Barry Arbuckle, PhD, CEO of MemorialCare, says many questions crossed his and other leaders' minds before they moved forward with their decision. \"We didn't have the infrastructure or [health insurer] talent, and that con- cerned us,\" Dr. Arbuckle says. \"This is very different from what we've done. Playing in the insurance space is very different.\" Ms. Goldstein of Moody's adds that hospitals looking to enter the health insurance business have to understand how complex it can be. Hospitals cannot flip a switch to go from a provider to an insurer, and state and federal health insurance laws can trip up many hospitals as they go along. Best practices going forward For hospitals and health systems looking to venture into a world of self-owned HMOs and health plans, there are many things to consider. Here are three best practices that are essential for any health systems to become integrated with a health plan. Outline specific goals and strategies. Dr. Davis has been with Geis- inger Health System since 1978 and previously was the CMO of Geisinger Health Plan before he was named CEO last May. As a physician and now an executive, he has learned a lot within the insurance space, and he reiterated one tip to those who may want to launch a health plan of their own: What's your goal and strategy for having a financing arm in your system? \"If you're thinking about getting a health plan, are you really clear on what you're using it for?\" Dr. Davis asks. \"What you should not be using it for: keeping traditional beds full and buy more hospitals \u2014 that's probably not a long-term strategy.\" Instead, Dr. Davis says hospitals and health system should view a self- started health plan as a laboratory to ask, \"What would be the most optimal way to take care of this membership?\" \u2014 a question that is at the forefront of healthcare reform. \"Then can we re-engineer care in a way to get that done?\" Dr. Davis con-tinues. \"How do you create a payment model that will sustain and support that value-based re-engineering?\" Dr. Arbuckle of MemorialCare says his health system asked many of those same questions. \"I would encourage others to follow the initial process we did: What will you have?\" Dr. Arbuckle says. \"This is not a business you know very well, so go through that deliberate process.\" Conduct the appropriate research, and know your options. Dr. Arbuckle says MemorialCare evaluated and weighed all of its options before deciding on starting Seaside Health Plan, which will eventually of- fer health coverage initially to 17,000 Medicaid and CCS beneficiaries with substantial growth expected in the future. (California Children's Services, or CCS, focuses on children with chronic and ongoing medical needs.) He says the health system had three main options: Start its own health plan from scratch, partner with a payor or acquire an existing health plan. Dr. Arbuckle and MemorialCare leaders ultimately nixed the first two op- tions. Starting a health plan from scratch in California would have taken up to 18 months, while partnering with a current health insurer on a new health plan \"didn't seem like a viable option\" because they didn't know how other health plans would react, he says. Instead, MemorialCare went with option number three: It will acquire cer - tain health plan operations and assets of Universal Care and has filed an application to become a California licensed health plan. According to Dr. Arbuckle, this was one of the quickest options, and it allowed Memorial - Care to keep on the talent and staff of Universal Care, for which Memori - alCare did not have the infrastructure. Ms. Goldstein of Moody's says the type of analysis exhibited by Memorial - Care is what every health system should expect to conduct before starting its own health plan. In some states, insurance departments require certain levels of reserves, and it is paramount health systems can answer questions such as, \"Will you have enough funds on hand to cover future medical expenses?\" and \"How will you price your product?\" In addition, hospitals should be prudent and see if their health plan would invade on another payor's market space. While Dr. Arbuckle says his pend-ing health plan does not cross into the coverage of any of his area's major insurers, hospitals must look at it on a market-to-market basis. Have the right governance. At Geisinger Health Plan, Dr. Davis serves as president and CEO, but the health insurance responsibilities are not his alone. The health plan is part of Geisinger Health System, and he reports to system CEO Glenn Steele Jr., MD, and the rest of the C-suite team. A hospital's health plan needs its own executive leadership, but it can- not be left alone. It needs molding and support just like any other branch of an integrated delivery network. \"We have a combined governance, and that has been one of the keys to our success,\" Dr. Davis says. \"The health plan is not something on the side \u2014 this is something we're all responsible for, and we do well by aligning with our mission, which is the triple aim.\" Ms. Goldstein of Moody's agrees, saying the most successful U.S. health systems that have health plans mirror what Geisinger does from a manage - ment perspective. \"At [successful IDNs], their management structures are such that there is a corporate-level CEO, CFO, etc. As you go down into the health plan divi-sion, there is a CEO and CFO with health plan expertise who report up to the system CEO and CFO,\" Ms. Goldstein says. \"They have management at each of the operating companies, and it rolls up into senior manage - ment. That's a key reason to why some health plans have worked at these longstanding systems.\" n35 Executive Briefing: Hospital-ASC Joint Ventures All parties in a hospital-ambulatory sur - gery center joint venture stand to ben- efit in many ways. Hospitals may gain new relationships with physicians while ASCs could receive a bump in reimbursement and gain access to the hospital's insurance product and additional capital. However, just because the potential benefits are plentiful that does not mean that a joint venture will be easy to set up or run smoothly once estab-lished. Hospital executives in particular need to be fully aware of what a hospital-ASC joint venture entails. Here are four things hospital executives should know before pursuing such a venture. 1. Financial situation. It is imperative that hospital executives have a good grasp on their hospital's financial situation before moving for - ward with an ASC joint venture. According to Brent Lambert, MD, co-founder of ASCOA, his team has run into executives who were not fully aware of their hospital's financial condition. This lack of knowledge could cripple the joint venture. \"If you build a surgical center and you are a part owner, it requires you to be able to put up money to build out the surgical center, to equip it and to have working capital. It's important the hospital have the capacity to do that,\" says Dr. Lambert. If a hospital can't contribute money toward the surgery center, many times the discussions end there. \"Each party has to ante up for their equity portion. They have to be aware that it is going to cost them money.\" says Dr. Lambert. 2. Capacity of operating rooms and case volume. Hospital executives need to have detailed knowledge of the hospital's op-erating room capacity and case volume so they know whether they are operating at or near ca-pacity, says Dr. Lambert. One of the prime rea-sons hospitals seek a joint venture with an ASC is due to a capacity problem: They do not have enough OR capacity to accommodate their staff and their surgical needs. A joint venture is an ex-tremely attractive option to deal with that issue. \"It is always surprising to me to find that CEOs are not really sure about the hospital's operat-ing room capacity. They need to check on that,\" says Dr. Lambert. \"If they are looking to decant some cases to an ASC, they need to have a clear understanding of their operating room capacity and what it looks like in years to come so there are no surprises down the road.\" 3. Strategy. It is imperative for a hospital CEO to have a clear understanding of the hos- pital's strategy, especially in relation to the hos-pital's competition. This is because the goal of a joint venture is to generate high profits and help a hospital retain as well as attract highly valuable surgeons, says Dr. Lambert. \"[In addition], if done strategically, [a joint venture] can increase market share and expand service area,\" he says. Be aware of the competition Realizing what the competition is doing is a key part of a hospital's strategy in the ASC-joint venture arena. According to Dr. Lambert, if a hospital realizes it is losing out to its competitor, then it can strategize how to use a joint venture to gain a leg up. \"For example, [ASCOA] met with a hospital whose competitor had recently built a new hos-pital exactly two miles north of its facility, and by doing so, had effectively cut off the whole northern county [of its service area]. In effect, the hospital we met with was only getting cases from half of the county,\" says Dr. Lambert. \"I said 'let's put an ASC center north of the com-petitor's new hospital. Then we would be the first stop in terms of surgical care for people in the north.' Those kinds of considerations are useful, especially if the hospital CEO has thought strategically and tactically about how [to] beat the competition.\" If executives get wind that a competitor is trying to recruit physicians for an ASC, it's a signal to them: they need to get going because they can't have a \"me too\" element to their physician re-cruitment, says Dr. Lambert. Know the physician landscape Knowledge of the physician landscape around a hospital is closely tied to competitor awareness: Hospital executives need to understand the phy - sician landscape in great detail in order to set up a successful ASC. \"Executives need to know who their valued surgeons are, what surgeons are available in the community and what surgeons are with the competitors. Those are the ones you want to highlight and go after when you do a joint venture,\" says Dr. Lambert. \"Executives need to understand [their] marketplace in great detail so they can place the ASC in the most propitious place that will play into the hospital's long-term strategy.\" 4. Each party's responsibility. The hospital, the ASC company and any other party involved in the joint venture needs to be fully prepared to fill their role. According to Dr. Lambert, the primary function of the hospital in the joint venture is to increase reimbursement over and above what an ASC could achieve on its own. On the other hand, it is the responsibility of the ASC \u2014 the company and/or the physicians \u2014 to run opera-tions in a highly efficient way. \"Each equity partner \u2014 the hospital, the ASC company and the physicians \u2014 have to do their part. If so, everyone is happy. If one of them shirks their responsibility, then it's a mess,\" says Dr. Lambert. A hospital-ASC joint venture can be profitable for each party involved. However, success is not guaranteed. Hospitals need to be aware of the four elements above in order to benefit from the deal. Just because a deal has potential does not mean it is guaranteed. n4 Things Executives Should Know Prior to a Hospital-ASC Joint Venture By Kathleen Roney Sponsored by: 37 Executive Briefing: Hospital-ASC Joint Ventures ASCOA - The Turnaround Experts ASCOA's expertise in ASC management is proven: 60 successful ASCs across the country. Our unique operating model has proven highly successful in provid - ing both excellent care to patients, and higher-than-average financial returns to physician-partners.Hospitals are increasingly looking to partner with physicians on sur - gery center projects, hoping to build relationships with providers in the community and strengthen their market share. Here are 10 hospitals that planned or opened surgery center joint ventures in the last several months. 1. Texas Guadalupe Regional Medical Center. Guadalupe Re - gional Medical Center in Seguin, Texas, has authorized CEO Robert Haynes to negotiate with the owners of South Texas Surgical Center regarding a potential acquisition. The GRMC board unanimously ap-proved the motion to pursue negotiations for the purchase of the sur - gical center's business and leasing of its building. Mr. Haynes said ne - gotiations might be completed by April 1. South Texas Surgical Center is an 18,000-square-foot facility with four operating rooms and two procedure rooms. 2. Cheyenne Regional Medical Center. Cheyenne (Wyo.) Re - gional Medical Center will soon open a new surgery center on its cam- pus, a merger of Yellowstone Surgery Center and Cheyenne Surgical Center. The High Plains Surgery Center will be formed by the merger of the two ASCs and located on the second floor of the medical office building at CRMC. Cheyenne Regional, which was formerly a share - holder in the Yellowstone Surgery Center, will be a co-owner of the new center. A group of 25 physicians will retain ownership of the rest of the center. 3. Geisinger Community Medical Center. Geisinger Community Medical Center in Scranton, Pa., has announced a joint venture with North East Surgery Center. The North East Surgery Center has 38 surgeons and performs general, orthopedic, plastic, colon, rectal, vascular, podiatric, uro-logic and ENT surgery, as well as pain management procedures. The center has three operating rooms and two procedure rooms. Hospital administra-tors said the partnership overlaps with the system's mantra of providing appropriate care at the right time and location. 4. Munroe Medical Center. Munroe Regional Medical Center in Ocala, Fla., has agreed to purchase a 20 percent share of Surgery Center of Ocala's business. The new partnership will give the non-profit, 421-bed hospital access to the surgery center's four operating rooms, two procedure rooms and 6 percent of the market share that the facility controls. The surgery center performs around 4,200 pro-cedures annually.5. Glen Falls Hospital. Construction crews have begun site work for a new ophthalmology surgery center in Wilton, N.Y . Local ophthalmologists and Glens Falls (N.Y .) Hospital are collaborating on the eye surgery center. The physicians formed North Country Eye Surgery Center, a company that will own 70 percent of the facility. The hospital will own the remaining 30 percent. North Country Eye Surgery is spending around $1.2 million for equipment. It will provide the staff and handle billing, while the hospital is spending $1.2 million, and will own the building and land. 6. HCA Virginia Health System. OrthoVirginia and the HCA Virginia Health System recently opened a 70,000-square-foot medical facility that includes an outpatient surgery center. The OrthoVirginia/HCA facility brings orthopedic specialists in hand, knee, hip and spine together with pediatric services and sports medicine physicians. The sports medicine facility, dedicated to musculoskeletal diagnosis and re - pair, houses the privately owned orthopedic surgery practice OrthoVir - ginia, along with HCA's CJW Sports Medicine program and a jointly owned surgical center. 7. Catholic Health Initiatives and Adventist Health. St. Rose Ambulatory and Surgery Center in Great Bend, Colo., will join Centura Health Initiatives, a Denver-based healthcare group. Centura is jointly operated by Catholic Health Initiatives and Adventist Health system. St. Rose currently belongs to Catholic Health Initiatives, which will in-tegrate its facilities in Colorado and Kansas into one regional group through this move. 8. Middlex Hospital. Middlesex Hospital in Middletown, Conn., is proposing to acquire a nearby ambulatory surgery center that exclusively performs gastroenterology and colonoscopy procedures. The hospital has submitted a proposal with the Office of Health Care Access. 9. Hackensack University Medical Center. Hackensack University Medical Center has announced a joint venture partnership with United Sur - gical Partners International and community physicians in the acquisition and operation of two ambulatory surgery centers. 10. Scottsdale Healthcare. Scottsdale Healthcare and its joint ven- ture partner Sovereign Healthcare have completed a transaction, acquir - ing majority ownership of Biltmore Surgical Center in Phoenix, Ariz. The transaction allows Scottsdale Healthcare to expand patient access to off-campus outpatient surgery services and strengthen alignment with physicians. n10 Hospitals Planning or Opening Surgery Center Joint Ventures By Rachel Fields 39 Sign up for the COMPLIMENTARY Becker's Hospital Review CEO Report & CFO Report E-Weeklies at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 As patient satisfaction continues to become a focal point of how hospital performance is measured and reimbursed, reform readi-ness is crucial. With 32 million newly insured Americans looking for hospital networks and physicians under Patient Protection and Afford-able Care Act, it is important to navigate patients to the proper point of care through streamlined coordination and align staff strategically to help manage the increased traffic and demand for services. As patient volumes increase, medical and nursing staff resources are at an alarming shortage to meet the care and communications needs of patients, while also attempting to maintain positive experiences that yield high satisfaction and optimal reimbursement. In fact, it is esti - mated that there will be a shortage of 63,000 physicians by 2015 alone. 1 Additionally, accountable care organizations are popping up around the country, and systems are faced with additional gaps in executing the new models \u2014 from member communications focused on patient education, outreach and management of chronic disease to access to primary care and follow-up communication to ensure compliance. Everywhere you turn, pa-tients and physicians are faced with a web of communication touch points that are begging to be connected. So how do hospitals who haven't yet tackled the ACO initiative take on more patients, with already bruised funding, an overworked staff, and yet increase the quality of care and customer service delivered? And how do established or forming ACOs prevent fragmented care and communica-tions? Below are six tips to effectively engage patients throughout a stream - lined care continuum, while also improving employee satisfaction. Improve patient access Patient access deficiencies often stem from gaps in business and opera - tional procedures and capabilities. From front-office staff to technology systems, hospitals and physician groups aren't always equipped with the optimal tools, data or communication and service levels that yield a posi-tive experience. Even if your hospital staff is delivering the highest quality medical care in your community, remember that consumers aren't always recommending based on the quality of medical staff. Most changes can cost little to no money, and may just be a matter of staff training. Boost employee morale With an already exceedingly stressful role, additive pressure can lead to serious and fast employee burnout. Before the hospital is able to imple-ment new processes or ask the staff to change the way they deliver care and an experience, it's key to check in on their current state. After all, if caregivers feel under appreciated and exhausted, they are more likely to be unreceptive. To boost employee satisfaction, simple initiatives can be implemented to secure morale such as establishing a recognition program, developing a cohesive process for setting and communicating expectations, creating a people-centric workplace culture, and reinforcing a commitment to accountability. Find an innovative approach to improvement through looking at other in- dustries Solving the complexities of healthcare is really no different than other companies outside of the healthcare industry faced with similar busi-ness challenges. For example, Starbucks focuses intensely on the \"experi-ence.\" The company started their company focused on the \"experience,\" not just selling coffee. By doing so, they have been able to sell coffee at a premium price during a time of economic downturn. Details matter Disney teaches us to focus on the infinite attention to detail. Every detail that you can imagine in an experience will not be noticed by each person who comes into contact with your system, but the one person in a mil-lion who notices a well-thought-out and executed touch will remember you most and likely rank you higher in satisfaction and quality. If you have considered and implemented a solution to something patients and families don't even know they need, you have succeeded at focusing on detail. Change perceptions A recent study published in Psychological Science showcases what happens when you become desensitized to the obvious in your work environment. In short, when we are too close to something, often we can miss the obvi-ous. Maybe that stained ceiling tile becomes less obvious to the eye, but it can jolt the patient's opinion about the quality of care they are receiv-ing. 2 Also consider how missing the obvious can impact care delivery. A call-light could be missed due to the distracting environment that has de - sensitized caregivers. This doesn't mean the oversight is caused by human incompetency; it means staff is surrounded by blinking lights and beeping noises all day. They're too close; they're missing the obvious.

Over communicate with patients Feeling \"in the loop\" can help patients feel more at ease. By explaining your role as a clinician in relation to others providing care, detailing the referral process and noting when a patient's question falls outside of your expertise, you're keeping patients in tune with what they need to know and making them more comfortable. 3 Being that patients are ill, in a new envi- ronment and don't speak the jargon, they are at the most vulnerable state. Patients are often too scared or not comfortable enough to ask questions; by being forthright with information, you are educating them and helping them understand and become more responsible for their own care. Follow-up Direct and swift follow-up with patients, either post-discharge or release from the emergency department, is one of the most crucial tactics in manag-ing patient populations, chronic disease and patient perceptions. While it may seem cumbersome, scaling patient populations by risk and acuity can help make the workload more feasible. Following up works to boost patient medi-cation and instruction compliance, improve the post-discharge patient expe - rience, manage care coordination and prevent unnecessary readmissions, all of which aides in improving patient satisfaction and quality care measures, and in turn shields reimbursements. One of the most valuable outcomes follow-up calls provide is the opportunity your organization has to gather qualitative comments and feedback about patients' stay experience. Improving patient access, boosting morale, finding innovative improve - ments, changing perceptions, overly communicating and following-up consistently throughout your hospital, system or ACO can largely aid in-patient and employee satisfaction, engagement and perception. Empower your hospital to care for the care-giver and empower staff to think how they can innovatively do the best possible. Reform calls for reform.

Copyright \u00a9 201342 Executive Briefing: Using Outsourcing to Transform HR Recently, hospitals and health systems have begun to hone in on improving efficiency and reducing costs in order to survive and thrive in the new era of healthcare under reform. One area where many healthcare organizations can stand to make great strides in both improved ef-ficiency and cost reductions is human resources. Historically, hospitals and health systems have fairly complicated human resource departments, since they have fairly stringent requirements to follow when it comes to human resources. For example, nurses, physicians and staff track their time in different ways, which can be difficult to coordinate, causing inefficiencies. On top of, and partly because of, that unique aspect of healthcare organizations' human resources, hospitals tend to patch together human resource software services and processes, which also leads to issues. \"Most...healthcare organizations in particular have a lot of technology and service providers that are involved in the delivery of human resource functions,\" says Terrence McCrossan, division vice president of ADP Strategy, a provider of business outsourcing solutions. \"That creates inefficiency.\" That was precisely the case at Pacific Hospital of Long Beach (Calif.). \"We actually had three separate vendors involved with time collection and payroll,\" Tia Schiller, the hospital's vice pres-ident of human resources, said in a report. \"One handled the time and labor information. Anoth-er processed the payroll. Still another printed the checks. It was all very strange, very complicated and extremely error-prone.\" Those problems and inefficiencies can be solved by outsourcing. When it comes to human resources, outsourc - ing can mean a variety of things. \"People picture a surrender of control,\" says Mr. McCrossan. \"It generally isn't what organizations get out of a service partner.\" In fact, outsourcing can involve as little as relying on a partner for pay - roll processing and tax filing. In most instances, outsourcing means leveraging technology and infrastructure along with administrative efficien - cy such as tax filing or garnishment processing. Pacific Hospital of Long Beach ended its human resources madness by outsourcing to a single-source provider, ADP . Benefits of outsourcing Outsourcing some or all human resource func - tions to a single vendor can have a major impact on hospitals' and health systems' balance sheets, opportunity costs and future successes. Saving money. First and foremost, outsourcing hu- man resource duties to an outside vendor can save hospitals and health systems money. Currently, the average hospital or health system spends anywhere from $1,400 to $2,000 annually per employee for in-house administration of payroll, workforce administration, time and attendance and health and welfare benefits, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers report, The Hidden Real- ity of Payroll and HR Administration Costs . The report, published in 2011, shows that organi- zations have, on average, a human resources total cost of ownership that is 32 percent higher when managing these functions in-house via multiple platforms as compared to those that outsource to a vendor via a common platform. \"Leveraging a service provider, when considered in conjunction with technology, overall is the most optimal way to achieve gains,\" says Mr. McCrossan. Opportunity costs. When hospital and health system employees spend time on administrative human resource tasks, they are not able to spend that time on strategic aspects of running and growing a facil-ity. \"The more time you spend on administrative tasks, the less time there is for strategic tasks,\" ex-plains Mr. McCrossan. \"[ADP] look[s] to take as much of the administrative tasks as possible so or - ganizations can focus on the strategic tasks.\" The staff at Pacific Hospital Long Beach found more time on their hands thanks to outsourc - ing. \"Increased automation means less paper,\" Ms. Schiller said. \"The automation relieves your people of repetitive tasks.\" Staying nimble . Healthcare-regulating legislation is anything but static. Healthcare organizations need to keep up with fluctuating laws, whether it be changing tax rates or general employment law. \"Most [organizations] don't have that exper - tise in-house,\" says Mr. McCrossan. \"Leaning on a company that does that full time is a major benefit for these organizations.\" By outsourcing human resource functions, hospitals and health systems can adhere to change without using their own time and manpower. Partnering up Finding the right vendor to outsource to can seem like a daunting task, especially because there is no outsourcing silver bullet that will work perfectly for every organization. However, there are two traits Mr. McCrossan recommends honing in on when choosing a human resources outsourcing partner. A sliding service continuum scale. While outsourcing human resources can certainly help most hospi-tals and health systems, deciding on the right level of outsourcing can be difficult. \"Every organiza-tion has a mix that is optimal for them in terms of internal risk profile or budget or strategic road map,\" says Mr. McCrossan. Therefore, they should partner with an outsourcing company that allows them to slide along the continuum of outsourcing options without locking in to just one option. That way, as the organization grows and evolves, the outsourcing company can grow or evolve with it. Future-proof technology. Technology and software are constantly changing and updating, so a human re - sources outsourcing partner should be able to do the same. \"Pick a partner that will keep pace with change,\" Mr. McCrossan urges. The partner should be able to integrate technology and not corner the hospital or health system into a software model or version that will limit them down the road. Generally, the right vendor \"should allow you to slide [on the continuum] but also bring breadth and depth of technology that allows you to grow and evolve,\" says Mr. McCrossan. Ms. Schiller appreciated ADP's ability to adapt to her hospital's future needs. \"Their functionality and scalability are enormous features. We know we can count on those solutions to help us ef - ficiently pay and manage our people, whatever the future might bring.\" nStaying Nimble, Saving Money: Considerations for by: ADP, Inc.

It presents a stark portrait of a healthcare system that has clearly lost its way. It's a book that should have a great deal of impact, because its author is a surgeon with a sterling reputation. On staff at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Dr. Makary is a dedicated proponent of patient safety and helped develop a widely used a patient safety checklist. For more than a decade, ever since the landmark 1999 \"To Err is Human\" report from the Insti-tute of Medicine, hospitals have talked a lot about instilling a \"culture of safety.\" With all the activity that has taken place, it's a real shock to see that er - ror rates have not budged for the most part. The book presents some bleak statistics. One in four hospital patients is the victim of a medical mistake. Thirty to 40 percent of our healthcare dollars pays for fraudulent or unnecessary care. Ten to 15 percent of patients are not given all their options for care. And a surgeon operates on the wrong body part 40 times each week. A Harvard study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2010 found that as many as 25 percent of all patients are harmed by medi - cal mistakes. These mistakes are the fifth leading cause of death in the nation. A culture of silence Stubbornly high error rates, Dr. Makary sub- mits, are the result of unbridled arrogance and a lack of transparency in our healthcare system. \"Healthcare's closed-door culture feeds compla- cency about its problems,\" he writes. In stunning detail, he takes on a tour of incom- petent surgeons, unnecessary surgeries and a cul- ture of silence that punishes staff who speak out about patient safety. Dr. Makary notes that some of America's most prestigious hospitals have worse patient outcomes than many community hospitals. We meet a Harvard teaching physician from many years ago called \"Dr. Hodad\" \u2014 not his real name, but one given him by his residents, as shorthand for \"Hands of Death and Destruc - tion.\" Dr. Makary, a medical student at the time, recalls that Dr. Hodad's operating skills were \"hasty and slipshod,\" and his patients often had complications, but his bedside manners were im-peccable. \"Celebrities requested him for opera - tions,\" he writes. \"His patients worshiped him.\" He believes there are Dr. Hodads at virtually ev - ery hospital across the country. It is not easy to report someone like Dr. Hodad. Had he done so, Dr. Makary believes he would have been ostracized. There was \u2014 and still is, to a great extent \u2014 a code of silence against report - ing physicians' mistakes. Furthermore, a physician can be excellent at doing one type of procedure and awful at another, but colleagues will cover up for him because of his fame. The book reports that Michael DeBakey, MD, the world-class heart surgeon who died in 2008, was a miserable stom- ach surgeon. When he performed spleen surgery on the Shah of Iran, Dr. DeBakey mistakenly cut the Shah's pancreas. The shah's death from complications of that surgery at the start of the Iranian Revolution changed the course of history. 'Fred Flintstone care' The book presents some alarming oversights in hospital ORs, which are especially frighten - ing for those of us intending to have surgery in the near future. Dr. Makary introduces us to \"Fred Flintstone care\" -- outdated medicine performed by older, often highly respected phy - sicians. These grey eminences haven't kept up with a recent breakthrough like minimally inva-sive surgery, which is incontestably safer than the old way of open surgery . But because these doctors are so beloved, so well protected and so hungry for more income, their patients will likely never know they had another option. Dr. Makary tells us of a politician who had a small abdominal tumor and was under the care of the chief of surgery emeritus at his hospital. The sur - geon, who had never learned minimally invasive surgery, took out the tumor the old-fashioned way. This no doubt forced the patient to suffer more pain, have a longer hospital and go home with a bigger bill, and all the while face a higher risk of infections and possible follow-up surgery. Covering up mistakes Rather than own up to medical errors, hospitals and practices seem to have become more profi-cient at covering them up. For example, the book says the patient form we fill out in the waiting room increasingly has a \"gag order\" in it. That is, we agree never to speak about a medical mis-take, if one occurs. Dr. Makary thinks gag orders should be banned. \"They are utterly contrary to a patient's right to know and to the concept of learning from our errors,\" he writes. The book also targets misleading quality claims made by some hospitals, which can ensnare unsuspecting patients in nightmarish medical complications. Hospital marketing departments can make even wildly over-the-top claims vague enough to escape violation of truth-in-advertis - ing laws. Dr. Makary recalls a young patient who was treated in a hospital that had designated it - self a \"Comprehensive Breast Cancer Center,\" even though it lacked necessary equipment and skilled surgeons. The result was her reconstruct - ed breast was permanently disfigured. A lot of quality concerns have to do with greed, such as when hospitals routinely pressure doctors to perform more procedures so they can make more money. Doctors often get bonuses for pro-ductivity, but not for quality, the book reports. It's an \"eat what you kill\" approach \u2014 the more pro-cedures you can churn out, the more you're paid. One of Dr. Makary's physician colleagues got a note from his hospital saying: \"As we approach the end of the fiscal year, try to do more operations. Your productivity will be used to determine your bonus.\" Performance, in this case, was \"certainly not based on improved patient outcomes and lower rates of medical errors,\" Dr. Makary writes. Bloated salaries The book shows that children's hospitals make a great deal of money pulling the heartstrings of donors, and much of it goes into the pockets of their executives. Some CEOs of children's hos-pitals make more than $5 million a year and have perks like their own company cars, first-class travel, country club memberships and retirement packages worth millions, according to the book. Dr. Makary writes that while the CEO of Na- tional Children's Hospital in Washington, D.C., cut the budget, he increased his own salary to $2.1 million, plus benefits. \"This small, 300-hun - dred-bed hospital was paying its CEO far more than the CEO of our mammoth, 2,000-plus-bed John Hopkins Health System,\" he states. Mind you, these are non-profit institutions that don't have to pay any taxes and continue to tug at donors' sleeves for donations. The book points out that the millions earned from these fundraising drives could be used to address mistakes in medica- tions, which disproportionately affect children and The Shameful State of Our Hospitals By Chuck Lauer, Former Publisher of Modern Healthcare and an Author, Public Speaker and Career Coach 46 Sign up for the COMPLIMENTARY Becker's Hospital Review CEO Report & CFO Report E-Weeklies at www.BeckersHospitalReview.com or call (800) 417-2035 Ardent Health Services , a for-profit health system based in Nashville, Tenn., and Amarillo, Texas-based Baptist Community Services fi- nalized their purchase of Baptist St. Anthony's Health System, also in Amarillo.

This cache of donations might also go toward raising the salaries of pediatrics caregivers, who are at or near shortage because they are paid relatively little. Pediatricians have a starting salary of around $110,000, compared with $500,000 for orthopedic surgeons, and the average pediatric nurse at one children's hospital gets 40 to 50 times less than what its CEO gets, the book says. What kind of message does that send out? The solution is transparency The best way to tamp down all the greed and improve healthcare outcomes, Dr. Makary maintains, is to end the secrecy at U.S. hospitals. Rather than micromanaging with excessive regulations, the simple act of transparency would revolutionize our whole healthcare system. If hospitals had to prove their claims of superior outcomes with real data, they would have to be more serious about meeting higher standards, and the healthcare system would be well on its way to recovery. Dr. Makary wants hospitals to keep precise records on a variety of mea- sures, including surgical outcomes, hospital-borne infections, readmission rates, payments to doctors, patient volume for each condition and clini- cians' use of best practices. The message is simple: When hospitals have to provide solid outcomes data, their performance improves. The book notes that when New York State began requiring hospitals to disclose death rates from coronary artery bypass surgeries, the ones with high mortality rates suddenly felt the pres- sure to make improvements. The results of the New York program are remarkable. Statewide deaths from heart surgery fell by 41 percent in the first four years of the program. When leadership at one hospital saw that the mortality rate of a particular surgeon was bringing down its score, he was ordered to stop doing heart surgery. The Dr. Hodads were no longer protected. Dr. Makary is taking further steps toward transparency in his own practice. He has started asking patients to review the notes he took on them on their office visits. Patients began correcting important data that he had gotten wrong in the interview. He also recommends what is perhaps the ultimate form of transparency \u2014 recording medical procedures on videotape and playing them back for the surgical team to evaluate. He adds that installing cameras at hand-wash-ing stations in North Shore University Hospital on Long Island improved hand-washing compliance by more than 90 percent. Signs of hope There are signs of hope that Dr. Makary's vision could yet become real- ity. The book says young physicians, medical schools and medical societies seem less willing to protect their poorly performing peers, and some hospi- tals have even taken a pledge of transparency. Trust, integrity and forthrightness all go hand in hand, and they should be the basis to revive our great American healthcare system. Transparency \"can restore the respect of the public in what many perceive has become a secretive, even arrogant industry,\" Dr. Makary writes. \"With accountability, medicine can address the cost crisis, deliver safer care, and earn once more the trust of the communities we serve.\" n Chuck Lauer (chuckspeaking@aol.com) was publisher of Modern Healthcare for 33 years.
