INTRODUCTION 1. Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) is a small and diverse country in a rapidly changing region . Its per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was US$1,740 in 2015, making Lao PDR a lower -middle -income country. With two thirds of the population living in rural areas, Lao PDR is still an agrarian economy. That said, the country is urbanizing, with the urban population increased by 40 percent between 2005 and 2015. It is endowed with significant natural capital, giving grounds to aspirations to provide increasing amounts of clean energy and food, and use its spectacular landscapes and rich biodiversity to develop tourism. Population density is the second lowest in East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region, after Mongolia, with less than 30 persons per km2. Together with being land -locked, this low population density impacts the cost of delivery of public services and export competitiveness. 2. The Lao PDR has made significant development advances in recent years . GDP growth averaged 7.8 percent per year over the past decade, making Lao PDR the 13th fastest -growing economy globally. Incomes rose and the extreme poverty fell from 34 percent in 2002/03 to 23 percent in 2012/13. Substantial government spending on improving connectivity have reduced the defici t in hard infrastructure: roads and bridges have been constructed and upgraded and electricity supply and air connectivity have improved, and access to some basic services such as health and education improved considerably. Still, some development outcomes have fallen short of potential, particularly for agriculture . 3. A range of sector -specific issues are imposing serious constraints on agricultural productivity and profitability . A better -functioning food supply chain can increase value added and incomes i n agriculture, but currently there are weaknesses along the entire chain. More specifically: (a) At the farm level, low farm productivity reflects poor availability of high -quality seeds and other inputs1, weak and/or lack of farm advisory services, limited i rrigation and drainage infrastructure, and regional differences in social and climatic characteristics. Consequently, the quantity and quality of produce are not consistent. Land under irrigation needs to increase, but also irrigation practices need to cha nge and include drainage and plot - controlled options (currently, most irrigation systems use flood irrigation, which is not suitable for non -rice crops). (b) Unsecure land tenure and lack of off -farm jobs in rural areas hamper a farm land rental market that co uld promote market -based land consolidation, which keep farms small and contract farming with ABs rare. Collective action is increasingly promoted by the government and donors through strengthening farmer organizations, yet most existing farmer organizatio ns focus more on production and less on marketing, quality improvements or collective bargaining. 1 According to the World Bank's Enabling the Business for Agriculture's cross -country report, Lao PDR lags behind other EAP countries with its scores on the seed and agricultural machinery indicators. Though Lao PDR performs better on seed registration, it faces obstacles in timely introduction and production of high -quality seeds. Dealers importing tractors face delays and high -cost procedures, while the standards and safety for operators of tractors are very low. On the fertilizer indicator, which measures laws and regulations on the registration, import, and quality control of fertilizer products, Lao PDR performs better than a few other EAP countries in regulating quality of fertilizers but it performs below average when compared to the broader sample of 40 countries included in the cross -country assessment. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 8 (c) Market fragmentation on the supply side and concentration on the demand side further weaken the supply chains. Farm -gate prices decline following the harvest as farmers rush to sell their produce while only few larger millers and agro -processors have the financial resources to purchase larger quantities of raw materials. For rice, there are around 9,000 medium and large mills; however, only half of the capacity is utilized as millers lack affordable finance to purchase paddy and store rice. Prices increase fast afterwards as the few larger mills can influence the price at which they sell. Very few mills work directly with farmers and farm groups through contract farming, although some initiatives show the sustained success2. Only few mills can access the commercial banks' working and long -term capital. (d) Most agro -processors and rice mills are of low efficiency. Few millers have modern equipment with typical millin g efficiency level of around 50 percent (head rice and broken). For comparison, the prevailing milling efficiency in Cambodia and Thailand is 60 -65 percent. It implies that Lao PDR annually losses 10 -15 percent of its paddy harvest at milling stage. Apart from rice, post -harvest processing of fruits and vegetables is poor, only few traders have equipment to accurately sort by size, density, and color, and packinghouses and processing plants remain too small to be able to directly participate in larger food chains. To circumvent this, Lao processors often operate through Thai intermediaries, which is also helping them meet increasingly more stringent quality and safety standards of foreign retailers. 4. The Government of Lao PDR has increasingly recognized these weaknesses and seeks to address them . Agricultural public spending has been recently increased to about 1 percent of GDP, in par with the neighboring EAP countries. Most programs still focus on paddy production, given that more than 95 percent of all farm households still produce it, but the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), the leading agricultural sector Ministry, increasingly pays more attention to other produce, farming systems and sustainability of production, quality and safety (i.e. Good Agricultural Practices), marketing, and branding of Lao products. Being located among two agricultural powerhouses, Thailand and Vietnam, Lao PDR can compete on quality and Lao brand, not on quantity, and this has been recognized by the government. MAF prom otes clean and organic production (e.g., green growth) underpinned by its 8th National Social -Economic Development Plan (NSEDP) for 2016 -2020 and actively engages with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC) and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) to implement the Strategic Action Plan for Development of Rice Sector in a coordinated manner, through the Food Security Working Group chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister. The objective of food security is being officially complemented by the objec tive of nutritional security, for which the supply of more diverse, nutrient -balanced, and safe food is considered the MAF's new priorities, and private sector, especially small and medium enterprises (SME), are seen as important partners. Implementation capacity of MAF and other Ministries requires strengthening to achieve the new objectives, for which the donor support is increasingly being requested and provided. 5. The Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) seeks to enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of Lao PDR's agriculture sector through technical and financial support to 2 For example, the Enhancing Milled Rice Production in Lao PDR (EMRIP) Project, implemented by SNV and Helvetas in 2010 -2011, was able to develop fair trading relations betwe en 21,361 small farms producing paddy and 21 rice mills. They report paddy yields to have increased 30 percent, farm income from rice to have increased 60 percent, and profitability of the targeted rice mills to have increased by 10 percent as a result of the project. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 9 increase in agricultural productivity and commercialization in selected strategic value chains. The project would focus on: ( i) the geographical areas with high agricultural development potentials; (ii) the farming systems with high potentials for commercialization (i.e. paddy, maize, vegetables); (iii) promotion of good agricultural practices and climate smart agricultural tech nologies and farming system diversification to enhance food and nutritional security; (iv) building capacity for farmers' organizations, agribusinesses, public and private service providers; and (v) building on and developing synergies with other governmen t/donor programs. The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase commercialization of selected value chains in the project areas. The Project has an estimated budget of USD 29.3 million, including government co -financing of USD 0.5 million, agribus inesses contributions of USD 5.6 million, and an IDA loan of US D 25.0 million . It will be implemented within five provinces (Khammouane, Bolykhamxay, Xayabury, Vientiane province, and Vientiane Capital). The Project implementation schedule is within 08 yea rs (2018 - 2025). The LACP is comprised of three components: Component A: Improved Agricultur al Efficiency and Sustainability. Component B: Enhanced Agricultural Commercialization. Component C: Project Management. 6. The Project has been classified as Environmental Category B by the World Bank. To comply with the World Bank Safeguard Policies and environmental management requirements of the Government of Lao PDR, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF, this document) was prepared to guide project implementing agencies and stakeholders on environmental assessment, mitigation of impacts, monitoring and reporting procedures during project implementation. The ESMF will be adopted by MAF. 7. The overall objective of the ESMF is to ensure that World Bank safeguards requirements are met. It will guide the implementing agencies including MAF, PAFO, and DAFO to adequately screen and address environmental and social impacts of subprojects, thereby determining the appropriate environmental category. Specifically, the objectives of this ESMF are: to assess the potential environmental and social impacts of the proposed project, whether positive or negative and propose mitigation measures which will effectively add ress these impacts; to establish clear procedures for the environmental and social planning, review, approval and implementation of subprojects to be financed under the project; to specify appropriate roles and responsibilities, and outline the necessary r eporting procedures, for managing and monitoring environmental and social concerns related to subprojects; to consider different alternatives, options, and relevant mitigation measures during project preparation and implementation; to determine the trainin g, capacity building and technical assistance needed to successfully implement the provisions of the ESMF; to address mechanisms for public consultation and disclosure of project documents as well as redress of possible grievances; and to establish the project funding required to implement the ESMF requirements and to provide practical resources for implementing the ESMF Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 10 2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 8. The proposed Laos Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) seeks to enhance the competitiveness and sustain ability of Lao PDR's agriculture sector through technical and financial support to increase in agricultural productivity and commercialization in selected strategic value chains. The project would focus on: (i) geographical areas with high agricultural dev elopment potentials; (ii) farming systems with high potential for commercialization (i.e. paddy, maize, vegetables); (iii) promotion of good agricultural practices and climate smart agricultural technologies and farming system diversification to enhance fo od and nutritional security; (iv) building capacity for farmers' organizations, agribusinesses, public and private service providers; and (v) building on and developing synergies with other government/donor programs. 9. Lending Instrument : The proposed Project would have a total cost of USD 29.3 million and would be supported by the World Bank through an Investment Project Financing (IPF) in the form of an IDA Credit for USD 25.0 million equivalent. 10. Project Costs and Financing : The table below presents the total costs and indicated IDA financing for the project. In addition to the proposed IDA credit, the government would provide an estimated USD 0.5 million in counterpart financing for the project, while farmers, farmer groups and agribusiness entities would provide an estimated USD 3.8 million associated with their matching grants.

This w ill include the design and implementation of the various surveys and other tools for monitoring and evaluating the progress of project implementation and the results of the project, including the impacts on the project beneficiaries, nutritional outcomes, and GHG emission reduction . Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 13 2.3 Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design 25. Value Chain and Cluster Approach . Lessons from many World Bank -financed agricultural projects have shown that the possibility of more transformative impacts is increased where technological adoption, infrastructure upgrades, and improved commercial relationships are pursued in tandem, through selected, geographically clustered, value chains \u2014with the targeting of value chains being based upon their growth or improvement potential. Agricultural value chains in Lao PDR are largely unstructured in which individual stakeholders are unable to resolve multiple problems alone. Direct interventions can help improve productivity, build social capital and reduce transaction costs. Such technical and faci litative interventions are necessary yet not sufficient. Experience has shown these investments are effective only when minimum conditions are met in terms of physical infrastructure and enabling conditions for market -driven agriculture. Such lessons have informed multiple elements of the design of this project, including the commodity and locational targeting, the attention to both hard and soft infrastructure, and the inclusion of measures to address the agribusiness enabling . 26. Small Farmer -Agribusiness Linkages . Global experience has highlighted the transformative potential of organizing farmers and enabling them to build regular and sustained commercial relationships with upstream and downstream agro -enterprises. Many World Bank -financed projects have supported the development of contract farming, productive alliance or similar relationships. The keys to success include the coherence and effective management of farmer organization (FO), the overall competitiveness of the company partner, and there being strong technical and/or market factors or incentives for the FOs and companies to want to closely collaborate. This calls for both selectively and a realistic time horizon when promoting more complex relationships between FOs and agribusiness companies. N ewly formed groups without any history of collective action will tend to be poor partners for companies. For new or weak FOs, support first should begin with develop ing core management skills and effective governance arrangements and undertaking a few basi c functions. Incremental steps in collective action (i.e. 'partnerships among farmers') should precede efforts to directly link them with specific downstream buyers. The circumstances in Lao PDR call for this incremental and cautious approach to farmer - agribusiness linkages, with the interventions in this project expected to provide the foundations for broader linkages of this type longer -term. 27. Supporting SME Agribusiness . In low and middle income countries, SME agribusinesses typically face multiple con straints in growing their companies and competing at home and abroad. These tend to include weak access to long -term (and often) working capital, limited technical, commercial, and supply chain management skills, and difficulties maneuvering through comple x and sometimes inconsistent regulatory regimes. These and other issues apply in Lao PDR. For both supply and demand reasons, several existing SME credit lines have had limited disbursements. The project will provide matching grants to support SME capacity upgrades, enabling the firms to access both the equipment and the advisory services they need to improve their operations and competitiveness. Experience and successful lessons from the previous project in Lao PDR : 'Enhancing Milled Rice Production Project3' (EMRIP) has been used to inform the design of the program - including having an independent (non -government) entity manage the scheme, having the selection process be rigorous, 3 The project was financed by the Europe Commission - Food Facility Program with additional funding from Helvetas and SNV. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 14 transparent and competitive, and having the grant proportion set to e nsure strong commitment on the part of the enterprises . 28. Improving Public Agricultural Service Delivery . Lessons learned from the past extension in Lao PDR showed that the top -down approach was ineffective because the contacts between government extension workers and farmers were only made on an irregular basis; the technologies being promoted were not always appropriate to local conditions and not always in accordance with the needs of farmers; the advice given to farmers was highly generalized and not alw ays useful; there was a lack of ownership and poor motivation among provincial and district extension staff; and there was weak coordination between different sectors. While the Government has a policy of giving District offices the responsibility for mana ging extension activities in response to farmers' needs, to put this policy into practice capability at district level needs to be built. The past experience in Lao PDR showed that participatory planning at the village level, with village authorities playi ng a coordinating role, was key to success. In addition, training should also be designed to solve real problems faced by farmers and involve the practice of skills under real conditions. Last but not least, incentives and transportation should be provided for field staff to improve motivation and efficiency. These lessons learned have been incorporated into project design of the LACP. 3. LEGAL FRAMEW ORKS AND APPLICABLE WORLD BANK SAFEGUARD POLICIES 3.1 Lao PDR Environmental and Social Legislation 29.

Lao PDR has formulated many laws, decrees, regulations and guidelines for assessment and management of environmental and social impact s associated with development projects. The revised Environmental Protection Law (EPL, 2013) is the nation's principal environmental legislation. The EPL set up unified environmental management for environmental resources with the objective of preserving a nd facilitating sustainable use of natural resources. The EPL includes measures for the protection, improvement, mitigation and restoration of the environment and guidelines for environmental management and monitoring. MONRE is responsible for implementati on of the EPL and various ministries have issued guidelines for implementing provisions of the EPL. 31. Government regulation related to pest management in Lao PDR includes Regulation 2860/MAF (Annex 2), which is a recent update (from 11 June 2010) to the pr evious Regulation 0886/MAF, which was established in March 2000 with support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The regulation was developed based on the WHO recommended Classification o f Pesticide by Hazard and Guideline to Classification 1994 -1995. In January 2010, the GoL registered companies who import pesticides, fertilizers and seeds into Lao PDR. Registered pesticides were also adjusted in May 2010, based on the new regulation. The Department of Agriculture (DoA) under MAF is mandated to oversee all usage of pesticides. 32. Decree on Protected Area No. 134/G Vientiane Capital -Dated 13/5/2015 - This decree determines principles, regulations and standards related to the establishment, all ocation, protection, development, utilization and inspection of Protected Areas in order to make the Areas become abundant and sustainable by focusing on the environment protection, watershed protection, prevention from erosion, protection of soil quality, protection of strategic zone for national defense & security, adaptation and reduction of climate changes, solving the global warming, contributing to the improvement of living condition for people of all ethnic groups and developing the national socio - economy. The government allows to use Protected Areas only in an allocated zone and must use in accordance with related regulation and law and ensure that there is no negative impacts on forest, quality of soil, natural and social environment. The use of pro tected areas for public benefit is the use for a research & testing, use as a recreation and tourism site, a source of medicines, a place for protecting watershed, biodiversity, natural & historical environmental and cultural source. The use of protected areas for public benefit shall be permitted by MONRE. Local people, who resides in and around Protected Areas and contribute to the protection and regeneration of forest and Non -Timber Forest Products in the Protected Areas, have the rights to use forest a nd forest products as determined in the allocation plan of Protected Area and related regulation and law. For the business use, individuals, legal entities and organizations can use Protected Areas in the way that does not impact on natural eco -system name ly the use for developing into a natural, cultural and historical tourism site, use for filming a movie or documentary and use for other activities. Specifically, the use for these purposes shall be permitted from related organizations and shall follow the allocation plan, regulated law and regulation. 33. Lao PDR has introduced a framework for Lao Good Agriculture Practice and Organic Agriculture Standard since 2004 and 2005. Until now, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has issued four ministerial decisions: (i) Decision on Good Agriculture Practices for Produce Quality Management Standard No 0539/MF, issued on 09/02/2011. The Decision is provisioned to supervise as a tool for practicing Good Agriculture Practice Quality Management Standard of fruit and vegetable production; as to create Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 16 value added for fruit and vegetable; as well as to improve quality of supply chain in fruit and vegetables production to meet the requirements of domestic and international market. (ii) Decision on Good Agriculture Practices for Environmental Management No 0538/MF, issued on 09/02/2011. The Decision is an instrument to manage fresh vegetable s and fruits based GAP to conserve and project the environment in and out of farm sites. (iii) Decision on Good Agriculture Practices for Produce Qualit y Management Standards No 0539/MF, issued on 09/02/2011. The Decision is provisioned as an instrument to ensure GAP implementation for agricultural products especially fruit and vegetable production in order to add more values and supply quality food in re sponse to demand of domestic and international markets. (iv) Decision on GAP for Labor Safety, Health and Welfare issued on 9/02/2011 No. 0540/MAF. This decision is an instrument to ensure protection of health, safety and welfare for workers who are workin g in GAP. 34. Lao PDR regulations applicable to the development of infrastructure projects include the Ministerial Instruction No. 8030/MONRE (2013) and the Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2012) which provide direction to the environmental and social a ssessment process in Lao PDR. Additionally, the more recent Ministerial Instructions on Public Involvement in the Process of Environmental Impact Assessment of Investment Projects provide updated guidance on the environmental and social assessment process. 35. Established in 2005 and revised in 2016, the Decree on Compensation and Resettlement of People Affected by Development Projects has particular ly relevance to the ACP. The decree describes the principles, rules and measures to mitigate adverse social imp acts and to compensate for damages that result from involuntary land acquisition or repossession of land and fixed or movable assets, including changes in land use and/or restriction of access to community or natural resources affecting Project Affected Pe rsons (PAP) livelihood and income sources. The decree aims to ensure that PAP and households are compensated and assisted to improve or maintain their pre -project incomes and living standards, and are not made worse off than they would have been without th e project. The provisions will be applied during the preparation and implementation of the social impact assessment (SIA), the social impact mitigation and monitoring plan, and/or the ARAP/ RAP. 36. The World Bank states that economic development requires, to varying degrees, providing infrastructure and facilities that improve livelihoods and well -being through the expansion of economic opportunities. WBG investment projects must pass the litmus test of its own environment and social safeguards polices and th e borrower country for a sub -project to receive funding. These safeguards policies help decision -makers to identify, prevent (avoid), minimize or mitigate harms to people and their environment. The World Bank safeguards policies also require borrower gover nments (GoL) to address specific environmental and social risks as a prerequisite to obtaining WBG financing for development projects. 37. The project is characterized by a number of proposed sub -projects for rehabilitation of existing irrigation schemes in t he five target provinces. This ESMF provides an overarching safeguards document governing the approach, processes and specific instruments to guide and inform the Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 17 Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), ARAP/RAP and Ethnic Group Development Plan ( EGDP), and other safeguard instruments and measures (if applicable) during sub project infrastructure investment feasibility and design studies. 3.2 Relevant International Conventions and Treaties 38. A number of international conventions are relevant to use of pesticides in project areas under the LACP. Even though the project will not procure pesticides and will likely result in the decrease of pesticide use due to good agricultural practices, the fol lowing conventions are relevant to general pesticide use within the project area: 39. Rotterdam Convention: Lao PDR ratified the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and their Disposal in 2010. Most of the pesticides on Annex III of the Rotterdam Convention have actually been banned in Lao PDR. The few compounds that have not been banned are nevertheless prohibited as there are no registered products containing these active ingredients. The one exception is alachlor. 40. Stockholm Convention: Lao PDR signed the Stockholm Convention in 2002, and ratified in June 2006. The Water Resources and Environment Administration serves as contact for the Stockholm Convention. A National Implementation Plan (NIP) was pre pared with assistance from UNIDO and UNITAR. Implementation focusses on PCBs. The main POP problems in Lao are PCBs and dioxin contamination due to past American use of the herbicide agent orange during the war. DDT has been used for malaria control, but t his ended in 19781. Except for chlordecone, HCB, mirex and pentachlorobenzene all POP pesticides listed in Annex A of the Stockholm Convention have been banned. These remaining four compounds, however, are not registered, imported or used. In practice, all POPs are thus prohibited. An inventory of pesticides available on the market in 2000 only found a total of 36 Kg of chlordane spread over 10 locations. This chlordane originated from Thailand, which banned the use of chlordane as of May 2000. A survey of 6 Provinces in 2005 did not find any POP pesticides on the market. The National Implementation Plan for the Stockholm Convention reports the results of a survey that only found insignificant quantities of 7.6 Kg chlordane and 0.25 Kg heptachlor. No DDT was found at former storage sites of Provincial health authorities, which used DDT up to the seventies for malaria control. Nation -wide inspections of pesticide retailers in provincial capitals during 2012 -2013 did not find any POP pesticides. 41. Other relevant bans and conventions for pesticides in Lao PDR: a. Methyl bromide has been banned in line with the Montreal Protocol. b. Lao PDR is party to the Basel Convention, the Convention on Biodiversity and member of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the C odex Alimentarius Commission, and the Asia and Pacific Plant Protection Commission (APPPC). c. Lao PDR also is a Contracting Party to the Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar Convention) to which is acceded in 2010. It has 2 sites designated as Wetlands of Internat ional Importance, with a surface area of 14,760 hectares. Lao pursues an active policy to prevent pesticide contamination of these areas in line with a Ramsar -Agriculture -Wetland Interactions: rice paddy and pest control resolution (XI -15), notably through promotion of IPM and organic rice production in vulnerable areas. In general, the Government of Lao PDR pays much attention to biodiversity and has taken various initiatives in support of wetlands conservation and sustainable use. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 18 42. International conventio ns and treaties in Lao PDR relevant to social safeguards: The Constitution of Lao PDR has been amended to incorporate human rights principles outlined in the international treaties and conventions of which Lao PDR is a signatory party. Chapter four, articl es 34 to 51 explain the basic rights of Lao citizens. In addition, basic rights as delineated in international instruments are included in many other national laws, such as the law on the protection of the rights and the interests of children, 2006 (see Ta ble 2). The GoL set up the National Human Rights Research Centre in Vientiane, whose main objective is to support, encourage, and implement human rights within the country. Its mandate also considers the carrying out of research on ethnic groups. The Centr e was approved by decree, No. 95, dated 11/07/06 and by Prime Minister's decree, No. 137, dated 24/07/2006. The Lao PDR has been a member of the International Labour Organization (ILO) since 1964. Though the country has ratified a total of eight ILO Conven tions, including five of the eight ILO core Conventions, Convention 169 on Indigenous Peoples has not been ratified. Table 2. International treaties and conventions in Lao PDR relevant to social safeguards No Name of Convention Date of Signature Date of Ratification/ Accession 1 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 7 December 2000 29 September 2009 2 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 15 January 2008 29 September 2009 3 International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance 29 September 2008 Not yet ratified 4 International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families Not yet signed Not yet ratified 5 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 21 September 2010 26 September 2012 6 Convention on the Rights of the Child 8 May 1991 (a) 7 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 17 July 1980 14 August 1981 8 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 7 December 2000 13 February 2007 9 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 22 February 1974 (a) 10 UN Convention Against Corruption 10 December 2003 29 September 2009 11 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 13 September 2007 3.3 World Bank Safeguard Policies Triggered 43. The proposed project investments are designed to have positive social and environmental benefits. The LACP has been classified as EA Category \"B\" and it is expected that the project activities, as mentioned in Chapter 2, will trigger the following Bank Env ironmental Safeguard Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 19 Policies -Operational Policies (OP): Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01); Pest Management (OP 4.09); Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10); Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11 ); Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12); Safety of Dams (OP 4.37); and International Waterways (OP 7.50). To comply with these policies, given that not all the subproject activities could be identified during appraisal, specific safeguard instruments were identified in Table 3. Key issues and mitigation measures are discu ssed below, and the actions to be carried out during the implementation of the project are summarized. Table 3. List of World Bank safeguard policies triggered for the Project WB Safeguard Policies Triggered Safeguard Instruments 1 Environmental Assessment OP 4.01 YES ESMF -ECOP 2 Natural Habitats OP 4.04 NO Non-Eligible activities 3 Pest Management OP 4.09 YES ESMF - simplified Pest Management Plan (PMP) 4 Indigenous Peoples OP 4.10 YES EGPF 5 Physical Cultural Resources OP 4.11 YES ESMF - Chance finds Procedure 6 Involuntary Resettlement OP 4.12 YES CRPF 7 Forests OP 4.36 NO Non-Eligible activities 8 Safety of Dams OP 4.37 YES TOR of Panel of Experts ( POE ) - findings and recommendations by POE . 9 Projects on International Waterways OP 7.50 YES The World Bank, on behalf of the Lao PDR government, will notify the Mekong River Commission (MRC) and the Myanmar and Chinese governments about the project. 10 Projects in Disputed Areas OP 7.60 NO 44. Environmental Assessment OP 4.01. This policy is triggered. The policy is applied to all elements of a World Bank -financed operation. This policy requires that environmental assessments must be carried out at early stage of project preparation so that safeguard tools (such as the Environmental and Social Management Framework, Environmental Impact Assessment, and Environmental Management Plan) can be determined and prepared in a timely manner to avoid or address potential negative environmental impacts. The Bank would not finance projects that, in the Bank's opinion, would cause adverse impacts to the environment in biologically important areas. 45. LACP has been classified as Environmental Category B by the World Bank due to its small scale and the impact from the project activities is minimal, localized and can be managed through appropriate mitigation measures. The project's overall socio -environmental impacts are expected to be positive. The project will finance improving agriculture productivities throu gh providing good seed quality, promoting good agriculture practices (minimize water and chemical fertilizer and pesticide use), and water management practices. Investments may also include small scale infrastructure (rice Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 20 mill, storage facilities, process ing house, irrigation and drainage refurbishment and upgrades, etc.), procurement of combined harvester machines, equipment provision as well as training. The envisaged investments are typical to similar agriculture development projects and are not expecte d to have adverse and unprecedented environmental and social impacts. Implementation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure and land improvements investments on farmer fields under Component 1 are mainly rehabilitative by their nature and are not expect ed to have significant negative environment and social impacts. The civil works on some small -scale infrastructure such as storage facilities, dryer, irrigation canals would cause some small impacts such as dust, noise, waste and wastewater generation and safety concerns during construction phase. Most of the negative impacts are short term, temporary, localised and immitigable. However, some proposed irrigated areas depend on 5 potential dams, the dam safety must be taken into an account to those sub -project financing activities downstream of those dams. 46. Given that the nature of the project is demand driven and the scope and targets of the project will be dependent on farmers' participation during project implementation, this ESMF has been developed for a pplication by the project. This ESMF provides policy provisions, principles and processes to address the environmental and social impacts. It describes procedures for impact assessment, consultation, preparation of subsequent safeguard instruments and impl ementation arrangements. As the Project has subprojects that will be identified during project implementation, the Bank required the Borrower (represented by MAF) to prepare this Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) to guide the screening o f potential impacts for subprojects. OP 4.01 also requires that public consultations must be conducted during the preparation of the safeguard documents. The final draft of these documents should be disclosed locally and at the Bank for public access. 47. Natural Habitats OP 4.04. This policy is not triggered. The policy requires that the project's siting avoid impacts on environmentally sensitive areas. Where project siting could not be avoided, weighting between positive and negative impacts would be consid ered, and mitigation measures must be proposed and implemented. 48. The LACP will provide support towards good farming practices in existing farm land and will not acquire new land for farm expansion into the natural habitats. It will also not extend irrigat ion systems beyond their original design/planning. As such, the project is unlikely to result in adverse impacts on environmentally sensitive areas such as protected areas, national parks, forests or special areas for biodiversity conservation. As the loca tions of small -scale infrastructure are not yet known at project appraisal, environmental screening will exclude subprojects that might cause adverse impacts on environmental sensitive areas. 49. Pest Management OP 4.09. This policy is triggered. The policy requires projects involving procurement of pesticide to prepare and implement a Pest Management Plan to ensure that the handling, transportation, usage, disposal of pesticide be safe for both human and the environment. 50. The LACP will not promot e the procurement of any chemical pesticides or herbicides. However, if pest invasion occurs, small amount of eligible and registered pesticides in the project provinces is allowed if supplemented by additional training of farmers to ensure pesticide safe uses in line with World bank's policies (OP 4.09). And given that the project is designed to promote the reduction in chemical pesticide and fertilizer use in existing farm land by enhancing sustainable farming practices, a simplified Pest Management Plan was prepared, along with a negative list. The Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 21 simplified PMP will be informed by the Regulation on the Control of Pesticides in Lao PDR (2014) as well as guidelines on Integrated Pest Management (IPM) provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of t he United Nations (FAO). The ESMF included the simplified PMP in Annex 3. 51. Indigenous Peoples OP 4.10. This policy is triggered. This policy address issues related to ethnic groups affected - either positively or negatively by this project. Some ethnic g roups are present in some part of the project area. Since location and detailed design of subprojects have not yet known - the time of project preparation, an EGEF was prepared to guide the preparation of EGDP for subprojects to be confirmed during project preparation. During project implementation, where ethnic groups are present in the identified subproject area - as indicated by the social screening result, a quick social assessment will be carried out - in accordance with Bank's OP 4.10 (Indigenous Peop les) to identify potential impacts that the subprojects may to have on ethnic groups. Consultations will be conducted ethnic people in the subproject area will be carried out in a free, prior, and informed member - as per project's EGEF to (a) solicit feed back from local ethnic peoples, including their concerns, recommendations, expectation based on the potential impact of the proposed subproject, (b) develop mitigation measures to address such adverse impact, including ways to enhance the intended developm ent effectiveness of the subprojects. EGDP for relevant subprojects aims to ensure ethnic peoples - either adversely or positively affected by the subproject, have opportunities to participate in subproject planning and implementation to receive project's socioeconomic benefits that are culturally appropriate to them. 52. Physical Cultural Resources OP 4.11. This policy is triggered. The policy requires that siting of subprojects should avoid impacts on any known physical cultural resources. Mitigation measur es must be proposed and implemented if a physical cultural resource be affected. Chance find procedures was developed as preventive measures for projects involving earthworks. The siting of small infrastructure under LACP will avoid relocation of any known existing physical cultural resources. As sub-projects, also may involve limited earth work, a \"chance finds\" procedure has been developed and will be included in an ECOP and construction contracts as preventive measures. 53. Involuntary Resettlement OP 4.12 . This policy is triggered because the project may require land acquisition to support the rehabilitation of existing irrigation channels. Because the exact locations of small scale infrastructure schemes have not been known at the time of project preparation, the project has devel oped a CRPF to ensure affected peoples are compensated for their affected assets and income generation activities. The purse of CRPF is to ensure livelihoods of the affected households and their income -generation activities are no worse off because of the subproject. During project implementation, identified subproject will be subject to social screening. If land acquisition or non -land livelihoods related impact are likely, a Resettlement Action Plan will be prepared in accordance with project's CRPF. All RAPs prepared for subproject must be submitted to Bank for review and concurrence prior to implementation. For Technical Assistance (TA) activities, potential social and environmental impacts will be screened and managed in accordance with the World Bank's Interim Guidelines on the Application of Safeguard Policies to TA Activities in the Bank -Financed Project . 54. Forest. OP 4.36. This policy is not triggered. The policy requires impacts on forests should be avoided or mitigated. The project envisions no investment in management of natural forests or plantations or involving conversion or degradation of critical forest areas. Activities to be financed under the project will be implemented in existing cultivated lands. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 22 55. Safety of Dams. OP 4.37. This policy is triggered. This will be re -confirmed during project implementation after screening has been made for the infrastructure sub -projects. Among 70 small infrastructure sub -projects which the projects plan to finance, there are five subprojects which plan to upgrade from earthen canals to cement canals and these canals rely on water supply from reservoirs. The h eadworks of these five reservoirs are classifi ed as large Dams as per the World Bank Operational Manual OP 4.37 for Safety of Dams. The The policy requires that appropriate measures are taken to ensure the safety of the dam, either a new dam or an existing dam which the Bank -financed project is direct ly dependent on. In this ESMF, a TOR of Panel of Experts (POE) has been p repared. During the project implementation, the POE will conduct: (a) inspect and evaluate the safety status of the existing dam, its appurtenances, and its performance history; (b) review and evaluate the owner's operation and maintenance procedures; and (c) provide a written report of findings and recommendations for any remedial work or safety -related measures necessary to upgrade the existing dam to an acceptable standard of safet y. Detailed roles assigned and mandated for dam inspection to the relevant agencies and organizations; strengthening the inspection, operation and maintenance officers as well as improving of inspection procedures and reporting system will be proposed in the Dam Safety Management Plan as part of the recommendation by POE. 56. Projects on International Waterways. OP 7.50. This policy is triggered. The LACP will involve project areas and irrigation systems located in tributaries which are part of the Mekong river basin. To comply with this policy, as requested by the Government of Lao PDR, the WB will send a letter informing other riparian countries (China, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam) through MRC mechanism. 57. Projects in Disputed Areas. OP 7.60. This policy is not triggered. The sites for the LACP will not fall within disputed areas of Lao PDR and, therefore, the OP 7.60 will not be triggered. 3.4 Summary of Objectives and Principles for Implementation of CRPF and EGEF 58. CRPF. The CRPF was prepared as a component of the ESMF for the ACP to provide guidance to decision -makers if a proposed sub -project requires use of land on a temporary or permanent basis and/or acquisition of land. Accordingly, the CRPF was prepared to establis h policies and procedures for preventing (avoiding), minimizing, mitigating and compensating for negative (adverse) impacts related to land acquisition resulting from a proposed sub -project. 59. Objective. The objective of the CRPF is to establish resettlemen t principles, organizational arrangements, funding mechanisms, eligible criteria, entitlements matrix, grievance redress mechanism and monitoring and evaluation process for RAP(s) that may be required for subprojects to be identified during project impleme ntation. 60. Principles . The principles that govern the CRPF, including principles for compensation, resettlement, and livelihoods restoration, are in accordance with the World Bank's OP 4.12, as follows: Physical displacement, economic and physical adverse impacts should be avoided where feasible or, if not possible, minimized by examining all available design alternatives, technology, and/or site selection. Where avoidance is not possible, impacts have to be mitigated; Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 23 If the need for resettlement is unavoidable, resettlement activities should be conceived and executed as an integral part of the project, providing sufficient investment resources to enable the persons displaced by the project to enjoy the project benefits; and All project affected people will be meaningfully consulted, and have opportunities to participate in planning and implementing resettlement programs. 61. The CRPF also aims to minimize involuntary resettlement and provide a framework for assessing concerns of PAP and PAH which may be subject to loss of livelihoods, assets and well being because of the proposed sub -project. The World Bank Involuntary Resettlement policy (OP/BP 4.12) is triggered when a development project (or sub -project) financed by the World Bank results in people losing land, other assets, or access to productive resources which may cause disruption to, or loss of, livelihood (i.e., property and assets), well -being and/or other entitlements. The CRPF provides decision -makers with guidelines and processes for ensur ing that PAP and PAH will improve their livelihoods and well -being or, at least, to restore them to levels prevailing at project commencement. 62. The CRPF provides details on the instruments to be prepared, and the measures to be taken, during specific stag es of sub -project design and feasibility assessment, and during implementation. The CRPF sets out the guideline for determining compensation eligibility and a description of what that compensation might entail. An CRPF (as opposed to a resettlement action plan) is the appropriate instrument at this stage of project preparation, as the project is in the planning stages and a decision has not been made by the GoL and the WB about which proposed sub -projects will be funded, and the features of those sub -projec ts. Such a determination until the project is under implementation when more comprehensive and up -to-date sub -project information is available, and a resettlement action plan (or abbreviated resettlement action) may be prepared. 63. The CRPF will be considere d applicable if proposed sub -projects affect households and communities which may be displaced, even on a temporary basis. Situations which may be subject to acquisition of land or relocation of PAP and PAH involve investment in civil works and infrastruct ure development, including rehabilitation and expansion of existing irrigation schemes and construction of agricultural production and processing equipment such as harvesting machines, drying and storage facilities to be financed under the Matching Grant. In such situations, impact screening process and forms will help decision -makers determine the safeguards measures for preventing (avoiding) or mitigating adverse effects. 64. EGEF. As a prerequisite for a project approval, OP 4.10 requires the borrower to co nduct free, prior and informed consultations with potentially affected ethnic groups and to establish broad -based community support for project objectives and activities. It is important to note that the OP 4.10 refers to social groups and communities, an d not to individuals. The primary objectives of OP 4.10 are to ensure: Such groups are afforded meaningful opportunities to participate in planning that affects them; Opportunities to provide such groups with culturally appropriate benefits are considered; and Any project impacts that adversely affect them are avoided or otherwise minimized and mitigated. 65. The EGEF provides a guideline document (OP/BP 4.10) to decision -makers early in the project preparation process to ensure that due considerati on is given to adequate consultation and engagement Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 24 of ethnic groups, including ethnic minority groups. As such, the level of social assessment conducted will depend on the nature and scale of the proposed sub -projects and its potential impact on ethnic groups. The EGEF provides guidance on how to engage potential PAP of ethnic groups in a free, prior and informed consultation process and for the development and implementation of sub -project EGEPs to be financed under the ACP Project (See project's EGEF for details). 4. DESCRIPTION OF TH E PROJECT PROVINCES 4.1 Geographical Locations and Topography 66. Lao PDR encompasses a total of 236,800 square kilometers and water area of 6,000 km2 with the terrain characterized by three distinct regions - mountains, plateaus, and plains. Mountains and plateaus make up three -quarters of the total area. The elevation varies throughout the country from the north to the south. High mountains, rising to an average height of 1,500 meters, dominate the Northern region. The lowest po int is Mekong River at 70 m. above mean sea level. The Phou Luang (Annamite Range) stretches southeast on the Phouane Plateau down to the Cambodian border; the other plateaus are the Nakai Plateau in Khammouane Province, and the Bolaven Plateau in Southern Lao PDR, which is over 1,000 meters above sea level. 67. The agriculture commercialization project area covers five provinces: Vientiane Capital, Vientiane Province, Bolikhamxay, Xayabouly, and Khammouane province. The project is generally located from highl and areas or the mountainous province of Xayabouly downward to the plain areas of Vientiane province, Vientiane Capital, Borikhamxay, and Khammoun province. The elevation varies from around 1,000 meters above sea level in Sayaboury and decreases downward t o approximately 200 meters above sea level along the Mekong. The two districts in Vientiane Province range in elevation from 210 meters to 180 meters above sea level. The area is generally flat or gently sloping throughout the project area, with mild eleva tion occurring between natural drainage channels and occasional mountainous rises. Flatness is a distinguishing feature: the elevation difference between one given point along the Mekong and another point located inland, perpendicularly, by a distance of 2 4km in Savannakhet are essentially the same; similarly, the approximate gradient for Xe Bang Heing throughout the region is 0.02 -0.03 percent. The project map area is shown below in Figure 1 . Figure 1. Map of Project Area Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 25 Topography 68. The hilly to mountainous regions in the Center and the South exhibit elevations from 500 to 1,000 meters, with some individual peaks over 2,000 meters, but with generally more moderate slopes than those found in the north. The area is dominated by the southwest monsoon climate, which brings heavy seasonal rainfall averaging annually 2,500 to 3,500 mm. The soils are like those in the North Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 26 except for on the localized area of the Boleven Plateau in the far South, which has deep, well - structured, and less acidic soils with the ability for good water retention and drainage. 69. The alluvial river plains along the Mekong and its tributaries in the central and southern parts of the country are where more than 50% of the population lives. These areas include the Vientiane Plain, a narrow plain in Bolikhamsay and Xebangfay plain in Khammouane Provinces, a larger plain of Savannakhet Provinces. These plains are the most productive areas of the country, dominated by a moist tropical climate that brings an annual average rainfall rangi ng from 1,500mm to 2,000mm. 70. According to the survey and conduction of agriculture land zoning at the provincial and District levels throughout the country, the total agriculture land is approximately 4.5 million hectares (equivalent to 19% of national lan d area) which is divided into 3 types such as: Flat area and suitable for cultivation of rice and short -life plants/cash crops is approximately 2 million hectares. Land area with moderate slope, deep soil layer which is suitable for cultivation of food crops such as corn, bean, green bean, fruit trees, industrial plants or commercial crops with the area of about 1.8 million hectares. Land area with natural grass that is suitable for animal raising such as cattle, buffaloes with an area of about 0.65 mill ion hectares. In addition, there is also the forested area such as dry dipterocarp forest area, unstocked forest area, scrub forest area and savannah area which is suitable for animals raising with an area of about 1.14 million hectares. 4.2 Basic Features of Proposed Project Provinces 4.2.1 Soil Quality 71. According to the report of soil types and soil classification by the Department of Agriculture Land Management (DALaM), the total agriculture land is approximately 4.5 million hectares (equivalent to 19% of national land area) soil types are classified into 15 groups (Classifies by FAO UNESCO 1987): Arenosols 72. The largest coverage of any given soil group within the country comes from Acrisols which account for a total of 11,579,913ha ( 48.90%) of the total area in the country. Alisols account for 4,444,215ha (18.77% ); Luvisols account and Cambisols account for 2,353,227 ha (9.94%), respectively. Coverage of the remaining soil g roups amount to 1% or less of the total area in the country. 73. Acrisols are acidic soils with a layer of clay accumulation. Parent material is most extensive on acid rock weathering, notably in strongly weathered clays which are undergoing further degradat ion. Physical characteristics include low structural stability; low cation exchange capacity; low base saturation; poor low nutrient availability; P -sorption and Al -toxicity; and being an acidic, sandy -loamy surface soil. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 27 74. Alisols are a new soil class, formerly part of Acrisols, with clays that have high cation exchange capacity. They are strongly acidic soils of the humid tropics and subtropics, with accumulation of high activity clays in the subsoil. Aluminum (Al) occupies more t han 50 % of the exchange complexes. In many Alisols, toxic quantities of Al are present, whereas other plant nutrients are low and unbalanced. 75. Luvisols are soils with a strong accumulation of clay in the B -horizon and are not dark in colour. These soils h ave clays with high cation exchange capacity. The productivity of the Luvisols is limited mainly by their physical characteristics: low structural stability; susceptibility to surface crusting, soil compaction, and erosion; low water retention capacity; an d susceptibility to drought. Deficiencies of N and P are common, while deficiencies of K, Mg, S. Fe, and Zn occur under intensive cultivation. 76. Cambisols are soils that have a slight profile development and that are not dark in colour. They are soils wit h beginning horizon differentiation evident from changes in colour, structure and/or carbonate content. The mineralogical, physical, and chemical characteristics are not possible to sum up in one generalised account, because Cambisols occur in such widely differing environments. Most Cambisols are medium -textured and have a good structural stability, a high porosity, good water holding capacity, and good internal drainage. They also tend to have a neutral -to-weakly acid soil reaction, a satisfactory chemica l fertility, and an active soil fauna. 77. Acrisols and Alisols are acidic soils, with low levels of plant nutrients and low in Ca and K. They have a l ow pH about 5.5 , present large quantities of iron oxide , and are conducive to P - immobilization. These soils are recommend ed for growing acid -tolerant crops. In contrast, irrigated paddy field soil will have a pH of about 6 to 6.5 that is more suitable for rice growi ng. Applying organic fertilizer, in conjunction with long-term crop rotation , could increase nutrition uptake by crops. Luvisols and associated soils support a wide variety of cereal crops, root and tuber crops, and grain legumes. Table 4.

Despite this, fertilizers are rarely used for upland rice cultivatio n. In contrast, the use of chemical/inorganic fertilizer inputs for lowland rice has risen dramatically over the past 10 years (though still less than 20 kg/ha, on average). Rice straw and manure from cattle and buffalo were found to be the most important nutrient sources (Roder et al, 2006). Lowland rice soils are predominantly acrisols, which have inherently low fertility, are highly weathered, and have low pH and cation - exchange capacity. 79. The map in Figure 2 shows a n overview of the soil types in Lao P DR. Figure 2. Soil Map 4 Roder, W., Schurmann, S., Chittanavanh, P., Sipaseuth, K., and Fernandez, M. (2006).

The country has rich water resources, with predominantly good quality fresh water. Water is essential to the life and culture of Lao people: it also contributes to the socio -economic development goals of the country. The contribution of the water sector to Lao PDR's overall development has been examined through water sub -sectors: Irrigation, Hydro -power, Navigation, Fisheries, Urban Water Supply, and Rural Water Supply. The amount of water used by each of these sub -sectors, respectively, has increased signi ficantly over time. The total of annual water flow in Lao PDR is estimated at 270 billion cubic meters, equivalent to 35% of the average annual flow of the whole Mekong Basin. The monthly distribution of the flow of the rivers in Lao PDR closely follows the pattern of rainfall: about 80% during the rainy season (May - October) and 20% in the dry season, from November to April. For some rivers in the central and southern parts of the country (particularly Se Bang Fai, Se Bang Hieng and Se Done) the flow in the dry season is less: around 10 to 15% of the annual flow. The rivers outside the Mekong Basin flow through Viet Nam into the South China Sea. These rivers are Nam Ma, Nam Sam, and Nam Neune. 81. Freshwater resources mainly coming from lakes, rivers, and g roundwater have tropical characteristics. Lao PDR has the largest per capita volume of internal renewable water resources in the Asia region. The country is divided into 64 watersheds. Fifty -three watersheds, or 91% of the land area, drain into the Mekong River ( the world's 12th -longest river and the 7th -longest in Asia) . The remaining eleven watersheds, located in Xieng Khouang and Huaphan provinces, drain into rivers in Vietnam. The Mekong River dominates Lao PDR's water resources. Originating from the go rges of southern China, the river travels though Burma, Lao PDR, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, and eventually empties into the South China Sea. The river level varies greatly between the wet and dry seasons, and the river's annual flooding plays a vital role in the country's maintenance of both its biodiversity and its economy. Flood -deposited sediments help to improve soil fertility, clean the water of pollutants and recharge groundwater tables. 82. Lao PDR is crisscrossed with a myriad of rivers and streams. The largest is the Mekong River, flowing for 1,898 kilometers from the North to the South, with 919 kilometers of the river forming the major portion of the border with Thailand. It is estimated that some 60% of all the water entering the Mekong River system originates in Lao PDR. There are major tributaries of the Mekong which are completely or primarily in Lao PDR. The catchment of these first order rivers exceeds 4000km2 and includes: Nam Ou 448 km, NamTha 325 km, Nam Beng 215 km Nam Khane 90km, Nam Ngum 354 km, Nam Ngiep 156 km, Nam Kading 103 km, Nam San 120 km, Xebangphay 239 km, Xebanhhieng 338 km, Xedone 192 km , Xekong 320 km and there are many small rivers are flowing to Mekong. . Project activities will be implemented using surface water resources, particularly drawing from the Mekong River and its tributaries. The average rainfall reported by Lao PDR is 1935mm, or 462km2, with an average runoff of 1055 mm, or 250km3. High rainf all areas occur in both the central province of Bolikhamxay and in the south of the Saravan province. 83. The main rivers and Mekong tributary flowing through target provinces as follow: in Xayabouly there is Mekong, Vientiane province is NamNgum, Vientia ne Capital is Mekong and NamNgum, Bolikhaxay is Nam Kading, Nam Xan and Mekong, Khammouane is Xebangfai and Mekong. 84. The source of water use for agriculture areas in target provinces : Water is key importance part Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 31 for crop production. Thus, there are man y sources of water i.e. rainfall , surface water from rivers, reservoirs, well/groundwater are using to grow crops in target province s, depending on social and environmental condition of each province and crops pat tern. In targeted provinces, access to surface and ground water resources are limited. Therefore, rain -fed agriculture is dominated. Status of rain -fed agriculture and i rrigated -agriculture in targeted provinces are summarized below : Xayabouly - Main water sources for paddy, and maize cultivation are from rain water and wat er from sub -tributary of Mekong; Vientiane Province - Main water sources for Paddy and horticulture are from rainfall and Nam Mang, Nam Ngum, and Nam Ngum tri butaries. Some villages use groundwater (well and tube well) for horticulture ; Vientiane Capital - Main water sources for paddy and horticulture are from rainfall, Nam Ngum, Nam Ngum tributaries and Mekong. Some village s use groundwater (well and tube well) for horticulture; Bolikhamxay province - Main water sources for paddy are from rainfall , Nam Mang tributar y, Nam Xan tributary and Mekong; Khammoune province - Main water sources for paddy are from rainfall , Xebangfai and Xebangfai tributary. 85. Maize cultivatio n in Xayabouly province is totally depend on rainfall (no irrigated system), but rice cultivation is divided into rain -fed and irrigated agriculture . In Lao PDR, r ain-fed agriculture is starting from May to October each year . Irrigated agriculture is staring from November to April. Main sources of the irrigated agriculture are from Mekong and its tributaries. Ground water will commonly use only for horticulture. Figure 3. River Basins in Lao PDR Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 32 Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 33 Flood Plain 86. Flooding in Lao PDR may result from seasonal high flows in the Mekong River (inundation of areas along the river and backwater effects in the lower part of the Mekong tributaries), high flows in the Mekong tributaries themselves, and from high local rainfa ll. The Mekong plain is prone to annual flooding. This is particularly common in areas of the Vientiane plain, Bolikhamxay plain from Pakson to Pak Kading, and the Sebangfay plain in Khammoune province. 87. Flooding from local rainfall can occur anywhere whe n the rainfall exceeds 60mm/day. The mountainous watersheds in the northern region are subject to flash floods and landslides. Table 5. Historical Flood Occurrences (2000 -2015) No. Year Types of damage Places 1. 1999 Flood Central 2 2000 Flood Central and Southern 3 2001 Flash flood Central and southern 4 2002 Large flood, flash flood and land slide Northern, Central, and Southern 5 2004 Flood Southern 6 2005 Flash flood and land slide Central and southern 7 2006 Flash flood and strong wind Northern, Central and Southern 8 2007 Flood and drought Central 9 2008 Large flood Northern and central 10 2009 Flood (typhoon Ketsana) Central and southern 11 2011 Flood (Haima and Nokten) Northern and central parts 12 2013 Flood Southern provinces 13 2014 Flood All part of country 15 2015 flood Northern province 88. Human activities and other interventions in natural resources should be carefully taken into consideration for watershed management. Shifting cultivation is often blamed as the primary cause of erosion, forest degradation and unsustainable agriculture, which indirectly cause flooding and droughts. The most vulnerable flooding and drought areas are the tropical lowland plains, which include the Mekong River Basin. The disaster profile in Lao PDR has been published by EM-DAT (EM -DAT, 2014). The profile shows that drought has affected a large population. More than 4.25 million people were affected in five drought events. Epidemics have proven to be the biggest killer with about 863 people killed in nine events. More frequent events are floods in the Mekong River, which have affected more than 4.0 million people. Table 5 summarizes the disaster profile of Lao PDR from 1900 to 2014 (MRC -GIZ, 2004) . Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 34 Table 6: Natural disaster profile of Lao PDR during 1900 to 2014 (EM -DAT, 2014) Disaster No. of Events No. of Persons Killed Total No. of Persons Affected Damage (000 USD) Drought Drought 5 - 4,250,000 1,000 Epidemic Unspecified 3 44 9,685 - Bacterial Infectious Diseases 2 534 8,244 - Viral Infectious Diseases 4 285 38,000 - Flood Unspecified 10 76 1,878,600 2,480 Flash Flood 1 34 430,000 - General Flood 10 392 1,723,258 70,128 Storm Unspecified 2 8 38,435 302,301 Tropical Cyclone 3 64 1,397,764 103,650 89. Lao PDR's mountainous geography also gives rise to significant hydropower potential. As a mountainous country with abundant water resources and biodiversity, there is high potential for hydropower development in various scales. Demand for electricity for the purpose of socio -economic development in the country (as well as the neighboring countries) has increased, providing opportunities for hydropower development in Lao PDR. As such, Lao PDR has a policy to base electricity generation mainly on hydropower. Groundwater 90. There is very little monitoring of groundwater quality in Lao PDR, even though it is the main source of rural water supply. The study made by the Interim Mekong Committee (1986) observed that the country is divided into two geological areas: the Annamian Strata occupying most of northern and eastern part of the country and the Indosinian sediments mainly along the Mekong. There are three different aquifer systems: 91. The Annamian aquifers occur randomly. These are local systems that discharge locally to the river or its tributaries. As local flow systems, they are not part of the regional flow system and will not carry pollution into the regional groundwater system. The potential water supply from groundwater in the northern part of the coun try is considerable in view of the high amount of recharge available. Water quality should be reasonably good and for the most part potable but will be iron rich. Yields up to 5 liters/sec can generally be anticipated. 92. The Indosinian group of aquifers , which have regional flow, includes rock of the Indonisian Moyennes and Superieures and is relatively young. They are mostly freshwater sediments, although there are horizons of brackish water, and one major zone of saline water. Yields of 12 -24 liters/se c can be developed. 93. The alluvial aquifers associated with the sedimentary deposits of the Mekong River are not rated highly as aquifers. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 35 94. Limestone in the Central Lao PDR is strictly Annamian in age, but its location places it logically in the Indosinian flow system. It has been described as having enormous groundwater resources. 95. To date, the only regional assessment of groundwater potential is the on -going study of groundwater in the Provinces of Champassack and Saravane funded by JICA. There are, howe ver, studies and use of groundwater at specific locations for urban water supply purposes, and several hundreds of wells have been drilled throughout the country mainly for rural supply but also for a few cottage and small -scale industries. Information re lating to drilled wells for rural water supply generally includes a location sketch, depth of the wells, type of pump and ground water level. Geological logging and yields tests are only occasionally undertaken. The information of drilled wells for rural water supply is kept at the offices of the Provincial Rural Water Supply Center. In most cases, the depth of the rural water supply wells in lowland areas varies from 30 to 45 meters and the yields varies from about 1 liter/sec to less than 5 liters/sec. 96. The groundwater is and will probably remain the main source of potential rural and small -town water supply, especially in lowland areas located far from the surface water sources such as the southern and western parts of Champassack Province, the hinterl ands of the Senbangfay, Sebanghieng and Sedone valley. Anecdotal evidence suggests that poor sanitation and sewage facilities are contributing towards the contamination of surface and groundwater. 97. In Lao PDR, most people living in rural areas prefer to u se surface water and ground water for their domestic purposes. In the project area, with the exception of Vientiane and Vientiane capital, there are a large number of communal tube -wells that were mostly provided by external agencies. The distribution and depth of the groundwater table in the project area varies considerably. The water table changes with rainfall, specific local geomorphological conditions, and the distance to the permanent water bodies. 98. According to the local communities and residents, the ground water is mainly taken from two types of wells: tube wells and open wells. Ground water from tube well is used for washing, cooking as well for consumption. It is of good quality for daily use. In the project areas, open wells are mostly used for horticulture purposes only. There is limited available information on groundwater application for agricultural production in Lao PDR. 99. The hydrogeological map of the Lower Mekong Basin (Figure 4) provided by the Mekong River Commission gives a visual overview of the aquifers in Lao PDR, as they overlap with the project provinces. Figure 4. Hydrogeological Map of the Lower Mekong Basin Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 36 Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 37 4.2.3 Meteorology and Air Quality 100. Lao PDR has a tropical monsoon climate, with a pronounced rainy season from May through October, a cool dry season from November through February, and a hot dry season in March and April. Monsoons generally occur at the same time across the country, althou gh th e timing of the monsoons may vary significantly from one year to the next. Monthly rainfall also varies regionally. Temperatures range from average highs around 40 degrees Celsius along the Mekong in March and April to lows of 5 degrees Celsius (or le ss) in the uplands of Xiangkhoang and Phongsali in January.5 The southwest monsoon prevails from mid -May to early October, while the northeast monsoon dominates from early November to mid -March. Generally, the average annual rainfall ranges between 1400mm and 2500mm and exceeds 3500 mm over the central and southwest region s. With the exception of the country's northern parts , temperatures remain high throughout the year, with an average highest temperature range between 35 -38oC and lowest temperature range of about 16 -18oC. In the subtropical regions of the north, the temperature range is much wider ; cold air from China and Siberia occasionally penetrates during the dry season, lowering the air temperature to near zero. The maximum temperature is 40\u00b0C (March, over lowlands) and the minimum temperature is 0\u00b0C ( highlands). Precipitation and the Effects of Climate Change 101. The pattern of average rainfall across the country from 2010 -2015 is seen in Table 7 and Figure 5. With the exception of Pakse in the south, the amount of rain decreased dramatically between those years. The situation would suggest that climate change adaptions will be required for community livelihoods. Table 7. Average precipitation in Lao PDR (2010 -2015) Year and Hydrology, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, 2015 5 Weather average and climate in Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 38 Figure 5: Average precipitation in Lao PDR (2010 - 2015) Source: Department of Meteorology and Hydrology, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, 2015 102. Climate change is happening globally and affects all countries. For Lao PDR, scientists predict that temperatures will continue to rise and that dry seasons will get longer. Rainfall, storms, droughts and floods will become more severe and frequent. Rainfall will become more erratic and weather events such as droughts or floods will become mo re extreme.6 The results of the USAID Mekong ARCC Climate Change Impact and Adaptation Study indicate that Lao PDR will experience pronounced changes in rainfall a nd temperature patterns by 2050, with significant ramifications for ecosystems, communities , and the livelihoods that support th ose communities.7 With around 70% of the Lao population relying on subsistence agriculture for their livelihoods, climate change effects (e.g. unpredictable rains and extended dry seasons ) will have a significant impact o n the lives of people across the country.8 103. Floods and droughts are the main hazards in Lao PDR, and both are dependent on rainfall amounts. If the annual rainfall is less than 2000mm, drought -sensitive areas are affected. When more than 200mm of rainfall accumulates in 2 days, this leads to floodin g along the Mekong plain. Tropical cyclones are not a direct hazard, since their force is normally diminished once they have reached Lao PDR from the South China Sea, but they can also produce floods as a consequence of heavy rainfall. 104. Figure 5 illustrat es this effect for the projected basin -wide precipitation in 2030. These projections come from CSIRO's work with 11 models 'best' representing the Mekong Basin. As such, the results are presented in terms of average monthly values for the entire basin ; this is not an outcome that inspires confidence in the simulation ability of the IPCC AOGCMs. In Figure 6, it is seen that for August and September, range of model estimates above the median value tends to be greater than the range of estimates below the medi an value. This characteristic indicates that the models as a whole are biased 'wet' in these months (MRC, 2011 -2015). 6 ProCEED - Promotion of Climate -related Environmental Education, Department of Environmental Quality Promotion Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Nahaidiau Rd, Ban Nahaidiau, Chanthabouly District Vientiane Capital, Lao PDR 7 LAO PDR CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITY PROFILE, USAID Mekong Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change, (USAID Mekong ARCC). 11th Floor, Mahatun Pathumwan, Bangkok, Thailand 8 http://www.la.undp.org/content/lao_pdr/en/home/library/environment_energy/climate_change_strategy.html Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 39 Figure 6.

As shown in Table 8, the average temperature has slightly increased over six years between 2010 and 2015. This increase could be the result of the climate change or the result of deforestation - forest degradation caused by other human development activities. Table 8.

In general, Lao farmers apply less pesticides/herbicides and chemical fertilizers in their farm practices, especially in rainfed low land rice farming pesticides/herbicides and chemicals fertilizer apply significant lower rates or no application. Farmers use herbicides on upland crop cultivations and in dry cropping seasons. However, overall, the application rates of the chemicals are still lower than the recommended rates. 107. Utilization of Herbicides. Normally, herbicides have been using by farmers in the upland for instan ce maize cultivation and rubber plantation and recently Chinese -investment -banana cultivation. Generally, herbicides are applied in one or two applications per cropping season. The main application is on maize farm areas, such as Sayaboury province, and ot her provinces for banana plantations. Types of herbicides are common found in the local market of the commonly used herbicides is paraquat, despite the chemical being banned more than five years ago, under Regulation 2860/MAF (Bartlett, 2016). The product is widely available and openly sold. Various brands of paraquat come from Vietnam and Thailand, which range in price from 'Fansipan' at 40, 000 LKP per litre to 'Gramoxone' at 170,000 LKP per litre (Bartlett, 2016). Three other herbicides being used are listed in Table 9: Table 9.

Utilization of Pesticides. Pesticides have been use both upland and lowland cultivations. Pesticides is widely use on long yard bean cultivation, some legumes and vegetables. Famers apply some pesticides i n dry season rice cropping. Pesticides that are commonly used in general farming including; Methyl parathion and Diazinon are mentioned to control Brown Hopper, rice Bug and stem Borer infestations. 110. Utilization of Chemical fertilizers : Fertilizer use in Lao PDR has been historically low, but there is evidence it is increasing. From 1980 -1990 fertilizer use averaged about 4 kg/ha on rice crops, as compared with 400 -500 kg/ha for Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. (Ahmed, undated) international rice research i nstitute (IRRI) in Lao PDR on farm budget for rice estimates application of phosphate and urea at 100 kg/ha/yr. this application rate can be expected to occur or be exceeded in circumstances where farmers have a secure supply and sufficient investment capi tal. 111. Fertilizer application : In general, Lao rice farmer utilize fertilizers lower than recommended rates due to two main reasons; (i) high prices of chemical fertilizer and (ii) risk in investment and benefit due to flood and drought. 112. For rice farmin g: field discussions revealed that in the rainy seasons Lao rice apply low rate of fertilizer application. In dry seasons, farmers reported that 100kg/ha of Urea (46 -00-00) or 150 Kg per ha of TSP (16 -20-00) is applied compared to recommendation rate of 2 50kg/ha of combined chemical fertilizers (Urea -100kg; TSP - 100kg; and KCl -50kg) . 113. For maize production : there is no chemical fertilizers use for wet season maize cultivation, while the recommendation rate is about 180kg/ha of Urea (46 -00-00) and mix fo rmula K2O) 150kg/ha (15 -15-15). For vegetable production , general vegetable farmers apply both chemical and organic fertilizers on vegetable commercialization production. The recommendation rate is about 150kg/ha of urea (46 -00- 00) for coriander, shallots, and lettuce (i.e. the common vegetables grown in greenhouses) . 114. For detailed information on pesticide and chemical fertilizer use within the project areas, please see Chapter 5: Environmental Issues. 4.2.5 Natural Habitats 115. The Lao system of National Protected Areas (NPA) covers nearly 14% of the country's land area and is recognized as one of the best designed protected area systems in the world. With large tracts of tropical monsoon forest, diverse wildlife populations and bizarre karst limestone formations honeycombed with caves, Laos protected areas have an abundance of extraordinary things to see. A complete map of NPAs can be seen in Figure 8, with full names and area coverage provided in Table 10. Figure 8.

The summary of total biodiversity conservation land area in Lao PDR is seen in Table 11. When considering landscape conservation efforts promoted by NGOs like the World Wildlife Fund, Lao PDR has been included in three of the eight priority landscapes for conservation in the Greater Mekong: (i) Southern Laos/Central Viet Nam (SSK). The areas \"support many of the rarest and most distinctive species in the region\", including tigers, elephants, and saolas (WWF, 2017).

Lao PDR boasts richly diverse wildlife, including mammal, bird, reptile, and amphibian species with high rates of endemism and national or global importance (Greatorex et al., 2016). Nonetheless, high levels of hunting for domestic and international wildli fe trade coupled with habitat loss are increasingly threatening the population. Wildlife has been declining and many populations are now at alarmingly low levels (Greatorex et al., 2016). Wild protein sources were traditionally important for the diets of L ao communities on a small scale, limited to subsistence consumption, but this has grown since the 1980s. Wildlife has since been introduced for trade in wet markets and, following the country's economic opening with the New Economic Mechanism, it is no lon ger related to subsistence consumption (Greatorex et al., 2016). Wildlife is primarily sold for food, but can also be used for Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 44 traditional medicine, pets and ornaments. Endangered Species 118. According to reports from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Lao PDR is home to rare and distinct species, including the Mekong giant catfish, tiger, Asian elephant, and saola. The saola, which was only recently discovered, is already listed as an endangered species. It is distributed in scattered locations in the Annamites , along the northwest -southeast Vietnam/Lao PDR border. Within Lao PDR, there are confirmed reports of the saola in the southern part of the Nakai -Nam Theun National Biodiversity Conservation Area (spanning both Borikhamsay and Khammoune provinces). Huntin g and fragmentation of range due to habitat loss are the main threats to the saola. Snares that are set in forests for wild boar, sambar, or barking deer also trap saola. The saola is also poached specifically for its horns, which are considered prized tro phies. Infrastructure development is also a concern because it often infringes on the saola's natural habitat. 119. Asian elephants are another endangered species found in Laos, with only 7,000 -10,000 remaining in the wild across the Greater Mekong region. Acc ording to the Elephant Conservation Centre (2015) in Xayaboury, there are only about 400 wild elephants remaining in Laos, in addition to 450 domesticated elephants. Figure 9 shows their distribution across the country. The prime danger posed to these anim als is habitat loss due to expansion of settlements, agriculture, the logging industry, and industrial infrastructure like dams and roads. Despite conservation efforts, they also remain targets of illegal hunting and trade for their meat and, in the case o f the males, their ivory tusks. Wild elephant capture for the purposes of domestication is also problematic. Domesticated elephants are typically engaged in timber harvesting operations, ironically assisting with the destruction of their own natural habita t. Approximately 9000 people in Lao PDR directly depend on revenue generated by the domesticated elephants' work. Reproduction rates are extremely low, which has exacerbated the issue of their small population. The Nam Pouy NPA in Xayaboury was identified as a top priority conservation area for wild elephants (elephant recovery, more specifically) by the Government of Lao PDR back in 2008 at the National Elephant Conservation Meeting. Human -elephant conflicts have also arisen as a result of close proximity between natural habitats and human settlements. Figure 9.

Tigers in Lao PDR are considered functionally extinct, with only a handful of tigers in the evergreen forests of the Northern Annamites and the Dry Forests/Central Annamites further south. The last tiger sighting was more than five years ago, and recent su rveys would indicate that no tigers remain in the country (WWF, 2017). Key threats to the species include poaching, habitat fragmentation, and poaching of the tiger's prey wildlife (reducing available prey for tigers to hunt). Figure 10 shows the identifie d tiger landscapes in the Greater Mekong region. While Lao PDR is identified as having tiger landscapes in Xayaboury/Khammoune, it remains that the species is considered functionally extinct within the country. Figure 10. Tiger Landscapes of the Greater Mekong Region Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 46 Source: WWF, 2017 121. The Mekong giant catfish used to be common along the northern Lao -Thai border, but is now extremely rare. At present, the species is found in the mainstream of the lower Mekong River in Lao, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, a nd Viet Nam. As the largest freshwater fish, the Mekong giant catfish is a species endemic to the Mekong River that migrates huge distances to spawn. Scientists estimate that the population has decreased by approximately 90% over of the last ten years, wit h potentially only a few hundred individuals remaining (WWF, 2017). The main threat to the Mekong giant catfish is infrastructure developments, like dams, that block migration routes and isolate populations. Reduced mobility along the river means that fish have fewer opportunities to breed. Over -fishing also threatens the species' population, as do pollution, siltation, and navigation projects that have destroyed critical spawning grounds. 122. Given that there are protected areas and natural habitats within all of the project provinces, the LACP will only select sites that lie outside of these areas/do not conflict with or impact these areas. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 47 4.2.6 Forests 123. Lao PDR has the highest proportion of its land area in natural forest cover among the countries in mai nland Southeast Asia. That said, the total area of natural forests has declined from 70% of the total land area (approximately 16.6 million ha) in 1940 to 61% (about 14.0 million ha) in 2000, then to 60% (13.9 million ha) in 2005, 59% (13.6 million ha) in 2010, and eventually to 57% (about 13.2 million ha) in 2015. The average annual loss in natural forest cover in recent years (2000 -2015) has been about 53,400 ha (approximately 0.23% of the land area), while it had averaged about 42,800 ha (0.19%) in the e arlier 60 -year period (1940 -2000). 124. According to FAO (2009) and Clarke (2008), the following main forest types in the country include: Dry evergreen forest in the northern area Tropical montane evergreen forest along highland areas of the Annamite Mountains and Bolovens Plateau Lowland semi -evergreen dipterocarp forest at the Mekong River Plain Tropical montane deciduous forest scattered in the Northern area Dry dipterocarp forest in the southern area Mixed deciduous forest in the southern area Lime stone forest in the Annamite Mountains Pine forest in the Annamite Mountains Subtropical montane forest in the Northern area 125. Land -use statistics derived from satellite images taken in 2015 show that the country had 13,231,443 ha of forests consisting of f ive types (evergreen forest, mixed deciduous forest, dry dipterocarp forest, coniferous forest, and mixed conifer and broadleaf). Together with 137,965 ha of forest plantations, the forest cover of the country in 2015 was about 58% of total land area. Bam boo and regenerating vegetation cover some 6,162,481 ha or 27% of the total land area. Agricultural land including upland crops, rice paddies, agricultural plantations, and other agriculture had an area of 2,486,297 or 11% of the total land area. The remai ning 4% of the land cover includes 75,638 ha of urban areas, 138,308 ha of savannah, scrub, and grassland, and 567,750 ha of water and other open land. 126. The Forestry Law originally recognized five forest classes: protection forest, conservation forest, production forest, regeneration forest, and degraded forest land/barren land. This was reduced to three forest categories under the latest amendment (Forestry Law 2007) to include: protection forest, conservation forest, and production forest. A descriptio n of each forest type is provided below: Protection Forests : forest areas selected to protect Laotian natural resources, such as water, river ecosystems, soil quality, protection from natural disasters, and environmental conservation, etc.; Conservation Fo rests: forest areas classified for the purpose of conserving nature, preserving plant and animal species, ecosystems, and other valuable areas of natural, historical, cultural, educational, and scientific significance. Production Forests: forest areas of b oth natural forests and planted forests that are classified for use and production. There are designated as such to support the production of wood and forest products, and to satisfy the needs of national socio -economic development where necessary. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 48 127. All of these forest areas may include land cover that is dense forest, degraded forest, base forestland, or land for village use - they are not strictly forest spaces. The state may act in allocating forestland for rational usage, to individuals, communities, an d organizations. Village forests are poorly recognized and not included in the three forest types as described in the current version of the Lao forest law (WRI, 2017). A map of the three fore st types can be found in Figure 11. Figure 11: Three Forest Categories - Location of Forests in Lao PDR. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 49 Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 50 128. The government has identified the direct causes for deforestation as unsustainable shifting cultivation, uncontrolled logging and conversion to agriculture and other land use with the underlying causes of wid e spread poverty, rapid population increase and weak law enforcement (MAF, 2005). Nevertheless, the government aims to achieve 70% forest cover by 2020 (FAO, 2009). In addition to deforestation, MAF and NAFRI have been concerned about insect damage on tree plantations and natural forests. 129. Regenerating vegetation, which consists of bamboo and fallow land of shifting cultivation, has also declined in recent years (2000 -2015) by an average annual rate of 4,500 ha. Forest plantations including those of acacia, eucalypts, teak, and rubber developed at an average annual rate of 8,000 ha over the same period. 4.2.7 Irrigation System 130. Sub-component A.3 aims to enhance irrigation service and water productivity in the targeted project area, in order to support agriculture commercialization and enhance climate resilience. It is comprised of three major activities: (i) improvement of irrigation canals (main, secondary and tertiary canals, pontoons, pumps, motors, structures, pipes, changing electricity wire, etc.) ; (ii) establishment and re -organization of water users' associations; and (iii) capacity development on irrigation O&M. An indicative list of 71 irrigation schemes and 25 groundwater management groups have been proposed by the provinces to be supported by the project. Out of the total 71 irrigation schemes in targeted provinces, 51 are pumping irrigation schemes taking water from the Mekong and its tributaries, 15 are gravity irrigation schemes supplied by small weirs, and 5 are gravity irrigation schemes fed by reservoirs. In those 71 irrigation systems, detailed repairs will be defined in detailed at survey and design step. At this initial stage, it is tentatively projected that upgrading and rehabilitation of existing irrigation infrastructures may inclu de: (i) 43 distribution structures such as water gate, diversion boxes, regulation; (ii) a total of 36 floating pump pontoons (iii) a total of 51 electric pumping units and 70 motors out of 102 existing motors (iv) a total of 5 km of flexible discharge pip es, (v) and a total of 159 km of canals. The 25 groundwater management groups are village groups using groundwater for vegetable irrigation. Rehabilitation plan as well as environmental and social screenings will be carried out for each scheme during proje ct implementation to ensure they are in full compliance with the World Bank's social and environmental safeguards prior to implementation. 131. Out of the target 71 irrigation subprojects , 5 canal upgrade subprojects are related to dams as they rely on water supply from dams . The other 15 gravity irrigation schemes are weir or check dams that do not create any water storage or reservoir. Thus, they do not qualify as dam structure. Below is the list and main characteristics of the 5 irrigation reservoirs: Tabl e 12. Indicative list of reservoir irrigation systems Province District Reservoir Name Dam Height Dam crest length Storage capacity (million cu.m) 1. Vientiane Thoulakhom Nam Phot 18 m. 2,101 m. 16.0 2.

The above information indicates that all 5 res ervoirs headwork classify as large d ams as per the World Bank Operational Manual OP 4.37 for Safety of Dams. The project interventions do not intend to do any repair or change on the irrigation reservoir headwork themselves . But the reservoirs are expected to be used as the main source of ir rigation water supply to the target command cropping areas. The proposed interventions focus on increasing water management efficiency in the distribution network. The rehabilitation works will consist in upgrading existing earthen canals to concrete lined canals or U -shape brick masonry canals. Associated regulation and distribution structures will also be included; their number and exact position will be decided in conjunction with the Water Users Groups at detailed survey and design stage. 133. To comply with Dam Safety requirements and due diligence, the following preventive measures are included in this ESMF and will be carried out during project implementation : (i) conduc t dam inspection (see Terms of R eference of Panel of Expert in Annex 7 ) (ii) assign detailed roles and mandate for dam inspection to the relevant agencies and organizations (iii) strengthen capacity of technical staff in charge of dam inspection, operation and maintenance (iv) improve the inspection procedure and the reporting system. It is expected that the repairs in those sub-project irrigation canals downstream of 5 dams will not occur before the third year of project implementation so it will provide sufficient time to comply with Dam safety requirements and due diligence. 134. Building on the initiatives taken by various government and donor investments on irrigation and drainage improvement in the targeted project area, this Sub -component is proposed to complement all the implemented, on -going and planned infrastructure investments, to focus more on completion of downstream and on -farm systems, and improvement of the remaining key bottlenecks, which are critical to realization of commercialized agriculture production. Below are indicative i nterventions summarized below: Activity 1: Improvement of irrigation infrastructures in 71 systems will include: (i) rehabilitation of 43 distribution structures; (ii) replacement of 36 pump pontoons; (iii) repair of 51 pumps and 70 motors; (iv) rehabilitation of 5 km flexible discharge pipes ; (v) and a total of 159 km of canals. Activity 2: Establishment and re -organization of water users' associations, including (i) re - organization and strengthening of 44 WUAs for the targeted irrigation schemes; and (ii) establishment and strengthening of 31 W UAs for the village vegetable groups. Activity 3: Capacity development on irrigation O&M, including trainings to: (i) 36 irrigation professionals, mainly DAFO irrigation staff in the project districts; (ii) 702 WUAs members of the irrigation schemes and v illage vegetable groups; and (iii) 8,290 irrigation farmers. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 52 135. Major benefits expected from implementation of this Sub -component are improvement of the existing irrigation command area and restoration of lost command areas due to unreliable water supply and deterioration of infrastructure systems in the past decades. Total current irrigation command area of the targeted irrigation schemes and groundwater management groups are 23,712 ha in wet season and 16,785 ha in dry season. After project implementation, the total command area will be 25,716 ha in wet season and 20,852 ha in dry season, which means a restoration of command area by 2,004 ha in wet season and by 4,067 ha in dry season. Together with the effects of institutional strengthening and capacity de velopment, these will consequently improve irrigation service, promote crop diversification, enhance water productivity, reduce fertilizer use and energy consumption, and increase farmers' income. 136. While specific interventions in the LACP will tentatively include the replacement of pontoons, pumps, pipes, and motors, and the rehabilitation of canals (e.g. lining of canals that were previously earthen canals), pipes and structures, any restorations would oc cur within the existing system. They would not involve: Changes to/construction/rehabilitation of dams Changes to/construction/rehabilitation of reservoirs Widening canals beyond their original design Extending canals beyond their original design 137. Moreove r, the above lists of proposed schemes are only indicative and are still subject to technical, social, environmental screening during implementation to ensure selection of only those most suitable for investments. 4.3 Agriculture in Proposed Project Prov inces - An Outline Rice production: 138. Rice farming practices vary and depend on social and environmental conditions at the village level. In irrigated areas where rice farming is mainly done for selling/commercial purposes, farmers are using improved rice varieties (DTK -11, DTK -8, TSN -7 and VTE -450). Improved rice varieties are of high yield compare to the traditional varieties and they are able to grow well in both rain-fed and irrigated environments, while local rice varieties (Hom -Mahaxay, Doryuane, Do rkhao, Sanpatong, and Dorkmai) are resistant to pests, suitable in flood prone areas, unfertile soil and good taste. There are early and late maturity varieties. Normally, farmers in a village use mixed types of varieties including early, medium, and late maturity rice varieties to avoid competing labor during the harvesting period. The traditional rice varieties are resistance to pests. When they are grown in the rainy season, farmers often do not have to use pesticides for pest control. In many target vi llages, most farming activities are done manually (i.e. broadcasting, transplanting and harvesting, etc.). 139. In the last decade, more farmers are adopting improved rice varieties and applying chemical fertilizers to improve productivity and adopt intensi ve cropping systems. However, intensive rice farming is still facing problems of soil degradation, pest outbreaks, and high investments. In addition, farmers still have limited access to good quality seed. It is often hard to ensure the purchasing of quality seeds, particularly from uncertified Seed Multiplication Centers. Table 1 3: Current and Recommended Agricultural Practices for Rice Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 53 Parameters Farmer' practices Recommendation technology Seed Farmers are keeping seeds from generation to generation. They use seeds at a high rate (80 -150kg/ha) Use good quality seed (purity, good germination, no contamination, homogenous type, suitable with paddy field and environmental condition). Seed rate sho uld be 45 -60kg/ha. Treat with Dithane M -45 and Benlate at the rate of 3 grams kg -1 for fungus. Variety selection Use the same rice variety as previous season Screen for the suitability of rice varieties (high yield and resistance to pests), use two or three varieties for rain -fed and irrigated areas. Soil preparing Plough soil and harrow on the same day in submerged soil conditions for transplanting. Plough soil two weeks in advance for composting vegetation without water, harrow afterwards in muddy conditions (i.e. not much water) Transplanting Use old seedlings (25 - 40days), number of seedlings per hill is 5 -7, spacing is 30 -40cm. Use young seedlin gs (15 -25day), use 2 -3 seedlings per hill, spacing is 25 x 25cm. Fertilizer application Apply organic fertilizers two months before ploughing (200 -500kg.ha) Apply one week before ploughing with 10 tons/ha In rain -fed environments: do not apply chemical fertilizers. In irrigated environments: mainly use fertilizers with formula 46 -00-00, 16 -20-00 and 15-15-15 (Urea -Phosphate - Potassium), rate of application depends on crop performance, otherwise it is abo ut 150 - 200kg/ha. In rain -fed environments: recommended to apply 100kg of 46 -00-00 (split into two times 25 and 45 days after transplanting (based on leaf color chard) and 100kg of 16 -20-00 as basal and apply leguminous seed after harvesting with rate 10 -20kg of seeds. In irrigated environments: apply 100kg of 46 -00-00 (split into two times 25 and 45 days after transplanting and 50kg of 16-20-00 mix with 50kg of fertilizer formula 00 -00-60 apply as basal, and 50kg of 16 -20-00 apply 10 -day after transplantin g. Leguminous seed after harvesting with rate 10 -20kg of seeds. No burning and wind flowing out. After harvesting: rice stump and other crop residues will be decomposed by used cellulose solubilizing micro -organisms. Weed control Hand weeding Use rotary machine. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 54 Parameters Farmer' practices Recommendation technology Water management Irrigate after transplanting and keep the paddy plot submerged for the whole cultivation period. Keep moisture up to one week and submerge paddy plot for one week and release water one week before applying fertilizer . Pest management No pest observation until outbreak Weekly monitoring by using light trap at vulnerable periods and applying botanical control agent before an outbreak. Harvesting Farmers o bserve by looking at plant colour. When 80 -85% of the grains are straw - coloured (yellow in color). In the dry season, harvest 28 -35 days after heading. In the wet season, harvest 32-38 days after heading. Post-harvest Sun-dry for two days after hand harvesting, after that pilling and threshing after threshing machi ne available. Use combine harvesters and rice grains will be dried on specific sun pad or use dryers and keep paddy after get 14% of moisture. Storage No clean storage, in some corner s they keep rice seed and old rice for consumption. Rice seed and paddy rice for consumption will be kept separate. For paddy rice for sale, farmers contact to business partners come to tak e it. Moisture content is 12 -13% 8 to 12 months. Insect bags, bulk, or hermetic containers. Maize production: 140. For decades, f armers in the target province s have been producing maize , predominantly for export to neighboring countries like Thailand, Vietnam , and China. Domestic consumption of maize is minimal . Farmers use hybrid maize varieties from Thailand (QQQ, 888, 777, and o thers) and Vietnam (LVN -10). Soil conditions are a very important factor in maize growing in the target province s. Continuous mono -cropping affects pest outbreaks, the soil's chemical and physical properties, and result s in low productivity. Current prac tice is for f armers to use tractors for ploughing soil; practice high-density planting ( e.g. using 20-25kg of seeds/ha) ; apply herbicides for weed control ; and harvest manually. Despite the productivity decline from 8 tons/ha to 4.5 tons/ha and high labor costs, farmers continue to grow maize. Nevertheless, there are no alternative crops introduced in this area with which to generate income. Current problems with maize production include declining soil fertility, increased agricultu re input s, and labo ur costs ( e.g. for harvesting, one ha needs at least 20 labors). To minimize investment costs, farmers are using machines in farming and apply herbicides to control weeds. Table 1 4: Current and Recommended Agricultural Practices for M aize Parameters Farmer' practices Recommendation technology Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 55 Parameters Farmer' practices Recommendation technology Seed Use hybrid seed, use 20 - 25kg/ha of seed Use hybrid seed about 15 -18kg/ha Variety selection Use variety providing by traders Use suitable varieties after testing Soil preparing Plowing in horizontal direction of sloping Plowing in vertical direction of sloping Growing Use direct seeding machine , but do not identify suitable spacing and density Use direct seeding machine, spacing between plants is 20 -25cm and between rows is 75cm or 80cm depend on variety. Fertilizer application Farmer doesn't apply fertilizers Apply optimum chemical fertilizer formula 46 - 00-00 120 -150kg/ha after 25 -30days and 45- 50days AG and 15 -15-15 150 - 180kg/ha. Use leguminous crops for rotation, mulch keeping and minimize tillage. Weed control Plowing, use herbicide to control weed Plowing, rotary using Water management Farmers are growing in rain-fed environment only Will introduce drought tolerance variety; improve soil water holding capacity by mulch and farm's residual keeping. Pest management Farmers don't apply any technical measures to control pests. Introduce integrated pest management, use tolerance varieties, apply crop rotation, intercropping and apply bio control agents. Harvesting Manual harvesting Use combine harvesters Post-harvest Sun-dry at plantation Will introduce both dryers and sun -dry means. Storage No measures to control pests Keep low moisture (15%), cleaning warehouse. Vegetable production: 141. Farmers from many types of vegetable crops during the dry season. Given that some vegetable crops are not resistant to rain, growing during the rainy season requires the use of a greenhouse. Growing vegetables in greenhouses is of high cost , so it is suitable for high value crops only. Dry season vegetable growing is also prone to insect attack s. The main vegetable insects include flea beetle, Colden bug, vegetable Caterpillars, L eaf folder and Aphids . Farmers' l ack of technical information and knowledge makes it hard for them to produce good quality vegetables during both the rainy and dry season s. Table 1 5: Current and Recommended Agricultural Practices for Vegetables Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 56 Parame ters Farmer' practices Recommendation technology Seed Purchase from agriculture shops.

EXISTING ENVIRONM ENTAL ISSUES RELATIN G TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION 5.1 Environmental Issues 5.1.1 Utilization of pesticide and chemical fertilizers 142. During the field investigations , a range of fertilizer application rates were reported. Farmer groups said that farmers in the area of Maha xay village use NPK fertilizer at about 100 kg/ha for the dry season. Fertilizer is most commonly associated with HYV variet ies of rate on the dry season crop. FAO reports that the recommended application rate for HYV rice is 90 kg N, 90 kg P and 60 kg K per ha. Overuse of fertilizer in Lao PDR is not a prevalent issue in Lao PDR at present as described in 4.2.4 . 143. There is no major issue found related to chemical fertilizer utilization in rice farming in Lao PDR as described on section 4.2. 4. However, i nsecticide is common ly use in association with high yield rice varieties planted along the Mekong River. Methyl parathion and Diazinon are used to control Brown Hopper, rice bug, and stem borer infestations. The main issues on insectoids uses are (i) Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 57 impropriate use and (ii) insecticide containers management, which may impact on environment and human health. 144. Herbicides are generally applied in one or two applications per cropping season. The main application is on maize farm ing areas, such as Sayaboury province, and in other provinces for banana plantations. Commonly found i n the local market include : choy sum are mostly affected by insects invasion and need insecticides applications. Main pests include the flea beetle, Colden bug, vegetable caterpillars, leaf -folder and aphids. To prevent insects, some farmers apply insecticides, value vegetables are coriander, lettuce and shallot, which are growing in greenhouses and low insectic ides application. 146. During the field discussion s, inappropriate use of herbicide s/pesticides has been reported. Improper use of pesticides and other chemicals in agricultural production , including those for preservative purposes , has been a significant limiting factor to the competitiveness of agricultural products in Lao PDR. Farmers are not well informed about banned herbicide/pesticides , while enforcement to control pr oviders is weak and limited . Utilization of Pesticide s at Rice Mill s 147. Most of the rice mill s located in the project areas are small scale , with a capacity of 1 -2 tonnes per day. Currently, there is no pesticide use at the rice mill s and associated storage facilities. It is not a common practice to keep commodities at the storage facilities for more than a day , nor is it common practice to conduct fumigation. The maxim um duration for rice storage at the storage facilities is 7 days. Rice mills in targeted district 5.1.2 Farm Waste Management Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 58 148. Farm wastes from project activities comprises of rice husk, rice straw, maize stem, maize cob, and vegetable wastes. Rice straw and risk husk as well as maize stem are commonly decomposed in the field and reuse as mulch. Maize cob and vegetable wastes will be processed for animal feeding . 149. As herbicide is a common practice in the Northern provinces , including Sayaboury province , hazardous waste, such as herbicide containers, are usually left and buried in the farm areas where animals and people can come int o contact with them. Currently, lack of farmers' awareness and unavailability of solutions (including technology and resources) have been major constraints for treatment of agricultural waste and hazardous waste materials. 5.1.3 Waste Management for Vege table Packaging 150. Waste from vegetable packaging is not an issue for Lao PDR due to the small scale of processing agri -business es. Waste from vegetable packing include s wastewater from the clean ing process and vegetable waste. Vegetable waste will be recycled as feed for livestock -raising and /or decomposed, as per common practice. No plastic waste arises from this type of business. Vegetable packaging facilities in Vientiane Capital 5.1.4 Ineffective Irrigation Systems 151. Recent weather irregularities, such flood s and drought s, have impacted the irrigation systems in Lao PDR. Most irrigation systems in the project areas have been damaged and are deteriorated because of the climate situa tion. As such, the systems can no longer allocate and provide sufficient water to existing and proposed agricultural areas. While many irrigation systems have been rehabilitated, some projects have not had adequate budget s for operations and maintenance ( O&M). Without O&M, the systems have fallen into a state of disrepair and c annot meet the needs of increased levels of crop production required for commercialization. Some project areas are rain -fed areas with no irrigation scheme available for crop producti on, which bring s food insecurity. 5.2 Available Options for Improving Traditional Agricultural Practices 152. For rice production : Use good quality seed and varieties which are adaptive to environmental conditions (i.e. pest resistance, flood and drought tolerance, high market demand) ; Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 59 Introduce new agr icultural techniques and technologies with low investment cost s, such as direct seeding ; drum seeder s; wet and dry direct seeding ; transplanting machine s; and other technology ; Introduce soil fertility manag ement by using leguminous crops after harvesting ; practicing crop rotation ; using green manure, compost , and decomposed farm residues ; applying organic fertilizers to paddy fields ; and optimizing f ertilizer application ; Use integrated pest management (IPM) , apply bio -control agents and biological extracts, conduct pest monitoring with used light trap s, diversif y crops , and use pest resistant varieties, break the life cycle of pests, produce and release predators. Apply water management techniques, wet and dry technology, introducing water holding capacity. Introduce new agriculture machinery such as rotary for weeding, transplanting machine, harvesting machine or combine and dryer for improve paddy rice quality. Conduct demonstration plots, organize farmer field schools, sharing information and access to technology information. 153. For maize production : Selection good quality and suitable varieties adaptive to local environment. Improve soil quality by using crop rotation, intercropping, and mulch keeping, deco mposed farm residues, and introduce nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilizing microorganisms, optimum fertilizer application. Introduce trapping crop for minimizing insects, use IPM; apply bio -control agents and biological extracts. Introduce machinery for controlling weeds, harvesting and drying after harvesting. Conduct demonstration plots, organize farmer field schools, sharing information and access to technology information. 154. For vegetable production : Introduce off -season vegetable cultivation. Seed production in dry season. Apply agriculture tools for preparing plots, watering systems. Introduce organic fertilizer production and bio -fertilizer application. Improve water holding capacity, apply water infiltration systems Use botanical control agents and botanical extracts to control pest, product predators and release at vegetable plantation. Introduce packing technology and cool rooms. Setting up crop calendar and vegetable menus for marketing. Conduct demonstration plots, organize farmer fiel d schools, sharing information and access to technology information. 155. Many farmers have recently indicated willingness to grow organic vegetables and employ Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) due to the high market value of organic produce and the incre ased safety for farmers associated with the associated reduced pesticide and herbicide use. One of the constraints in growing organic and GAP vegetables is the certification process - specifically the quality management, which is required in marketing the products. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 60 6.0 POTENTIAL IMPACTS 6.1 Environmental Impacts 156. The ACP has been designed with various activities including research and technology transfer, supporting businesses by establishing partnerships, and investments on small scale infrastructure, etc. Overall, the ACP is expected to bring about major positiv e impacts as the overall objectives of Project activities are to increase the competitiveness of agricultural products and create better access to more stable markets for farmers, thus improving income security for farmers. On the other hand, Project acti vities under Component A also aim at reducing the impacts of traditional agricultural farming practices (by promoting the application of IPM and GAP) and trialing more environmentally - friendly farming models, including options for agricultural waste treatm ent. 157. Beside these major positive impacts, the ACP may also cause moderate negative impacts. The potential negative impacts have been assessed by means of site visits, discussions with local authorities and beneficiaries, and the use of secondary sources for information. This section summarizes the potential environmental impacts and required mitigation, which will be incorporated into Environmental Management Plans prepared for any subprojects, as required. The potential environmental issues and concerns identified were: (i) environmental effects of agricultural activities, (ii) small scale infrastructure works, and (iii) solid waste management from agri -business processing. Each of these concerns are detailed below. Component A: Improved Agriculture Eff iciency and Sustainability 158. Under Component A of the ACP, there may be some investments in small -scale civil works for irrigation scheme rehabilitation (e.g. canal networks), improving pumping stations for irrigated paddy field and diversified crops and on -farm demonstration sites (e.g. fencing, roofing, and watering systems). Considering the small scale and localized nature of the demonstration models, it is expected that only minor impacts, such as increase local noise and dust levels, may occur, and som e waste may be generated on -site. These minor impacts can be mitigated and appropriate mitigation measures will be implemented at sites that close to houses and/or sensitive receptors. In cases where increased dust levels may affect people, farmers will spray water to reduce dust level. Safety for farmers during installation of these works must be taken into consideration, otherwise accidents such as falling into excavated channels, holes, or electrical shocks may happen. The mitigation measures propose d in Section 7 shall be carried out by farmers to prevent these risks. 159. Similarly, environmental impacts of demonstration cultivation farms should also be considered with respect to the broader picture. The main environmental issues regarding cultivation would relate to the use of chemical fertilizers, herbicides/pesticides, and environmental pollution due to waste generation. Improper use of herbicides/pesticides and other chemicals will lead to health hazards for those who have direct or indirect contac t with the chemicals and/or are consuming products containing chemical residues exceeding recommended limits. The measures for mitigating the impacts of herbicides/pesticides practices (IPM and PMP) as well as GAP were described in Section 8. Component B: Enhanced Agriculture Commercialization 160. Under this component, the Project will provide financial assistance to co -finance the Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 61 implementation of partnership business plans, including investments in advisory services and long term assets (e.g. goods and works) enhancing post -harvest and production activities of the potential partnerships. There may be some investments in small -scale civil works for improving of rice mill facilities, construction of small scale storage facilities, small cold room, and valu e added processing facilities such as vegetable packaging house. Good engineering practices, clean technology will be applied to avoid and minimize the adverse impact from the implementation of these activities. Appropriate refrigerants (non -Ozone Deplet ing Substances -(ODS) and low Global Warming Potential (GWP) substances) will be selected taking into the consideration of the non -eligible activities listed in Annex 1 to reduce the impact from project activities to climate change. 161. At the time of EA and E SMF preparation, some proposed types of partnerships and details on production activities to be supported by the LACP have been suggested; specifically: rice mills, seed graders, and storage facilities. Subsequent impacts from those activities have also be en considered and are detailed below: (a) Rice mills: Due to its small scale (maximum capacity about 1 -2 ton/day), the impact from dust, noise pollution, and rice husk waste are considered minimal in their effect on human health and environment. Particulates are generally of large size, so they deposit rapidly without long distance drift; dust emissions are of no specific damage to health (non -toxic), nor does the fallout despoil surfaces. Cyclone separation is an effective removal mechanism for small mills, sometimes in series (cascading cyclones); larger mill need to install bag filters. (b) Post-harvest machinery is also associated with related safety issues. Farmers and agribusiness workers may be trained on how to operate machinery, including proper use and regular maintenance. (c) For cold room facilities, ODS based -refrigerant with high GWP may be used that may cause negative impact to climate change. Under this component, selection of refrigerants for cold room facilities will be taken into an account to mini mize the negative impact to the global warming issue. (d) For vegetable packaging, wastewater from cleansing process should be minimized. Component C: Project Management 162. This component would provide equipment and incremental operating costs for project monitoring, financial management, and procurement activities; ensure compliance with the safeguards; support the short and long -term technical assistance to the project management team in selected areas; and support analysis and dissemination of findings related to the effectiveness and challenges associated with the different institutional and technical models being applied or piloted under the project.

Remo ved pre ssure to forest increases biodiversi ty. 6.2 Social Impacts 163. The project impact is anticipated to be overall positive given that project will provide farmers with opportunities to a) learn new farming knowledge and access high quality seed, b) imp rove their income by diversifying their crops on the basic of local knowledge and practices, c) work together with their fellow farmers to supply their farm product to private companies under productive partnerships, d) benefit from improved irrigation sys tems, and e) improved nutritional status for their families. Through Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 63 various project activities at community level, there would be more opportunities for men and women to participate in project planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Ethnic gr oups will be included have chance to participate in continuous consultation of the project to become beneficiaries. They can choose to join project activities that are appropriate to them in terms of farming practices and their culture. 164. In terms of adverse impact, the adverse impact is envisaged to be minor. Of the three project components, component A (Improved Agriculture Efficiency and Sustainability), is the one that could potentially result in land acquisition because of construction activities that will be done to rehabilitate existing irrigation systems. Based on the nature of the rehabilitation work, and the scope of work, no physically resettlement is envisaged. However, minor land acquisition (permanent and temporary) is anticipated as linin g activities is done for existing water channels that may affect land and crops of local people. Some temporary minor non -land impact, such as noise, dust, temporary disruption of water access for small agricultural area, are anticipated, which may affect agricultural production or income generation activities of local peoples (local shops, businesses, etc.). Loss of land or access to resources in relation to mapping, demarcation, and registration of irrigation land/systems in the project area on a block ba sis (e.g. the process disregarding land under customary management and/or fallows) are likely. However, the likelihood of occurrence is low because of the nature of this exercise. 165. Gender analysis : A gender analysis was conducted for this project to identify gaps between males and females in agricultural production. Then, on the basis of the identified gaps, assess the extent to which the identified gaps are likely to affect the likelihoods of achieving the intended project development outcomes and propose actions that close the gaps - to enhance the achievement of the intended results (outcome level). The results of the analysis, from both secondary data sources, and consultation with local peoples, indicated that: Division of labor between men and w omen in the project areas is similar to the traditional gender stereotype in Laos. Men assume heavy works such land preparation, fetching water, irrigation, and poisonous works such as pesticide spraying, attend community events whereas women undertake h ome roles, including child care, food preparation, feeding animal. However, empirical data indicated positive changes for the case of maize and rice farmers adopt contract farming, suggesting there is an intra -household adjustment of labor division to meet the requirements as agreed under the contract). Division of labor in contract farm model was adjusted towards optimization to overcome family labor shortage to be able to respond to contract requirements. This adjustment contributes to reducing work b urden on women - on a daily basis - through reduction of time, while at the same time improving women's decision power given their increased influential role with regards to adoption of new technologies. This opens up opportunities to them to learn and socialize. Agricultural extension. Farmers however are not pleased with the current extension services - from both government (given the limited number of visits for technical support), and from the millers, who did not provide them technical support as they wished. Contract Agreement and Trust . Farmers rely on millers/retailers who provide them agricultural input (for their crop). However, they think the prices they got paid by millers are very low. Also, risks of crop failure are not shared by millers. This also affect the way they set up the contract. Farmers tend to prefer verbal agreement, which allows them chance to sell their Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 64 rice (upon harvest) at a higher price with other millers (not with the miller they make verbal agreement with at the beginning of the crop). Lack of organization of contract farming. Interview with farmers at the study sites suggested that they are dealing with miller on their own, not as a group which affect their price negotiation power. Nutrition. Farmers use most of the food the y grow to ensure nutrition for their families. However, many farmers who focus on main crop may not have a diversity of foods to ensure well balanced diet for their family. 7.0 MITIGATION MEASURES & APPROACH TO ENHANCE POSITIVE IMPACTS Environment 166. This section discusses about impacts and mitigation from two prospective components. The first component, Component A, focuses on improved agriculture efficiency and sustainability that will be generated. Impacts are considered with respect to the agricultural production activities and the small scale civil works. Following table is described the impacts and mitigation measure from the agricultural production activities . Table 1 7. Proposed Mitigation Measures Potential Impacts/Issues Mitigation Measures Improved Agriculture Efficiency and Sustainability Excessive application of fertilizer Application of appropriate extension technology through the agriculture extension agencies. Provision of IPM and GAP procedures and train to farmer groups at demonstrat ion sites. Overuse of herbicides/ pesticides Provision of IPM and GAP procedures and train to farmer groups at demonstration sites. Use proper equipment on days with no wind and rain. Introduction of new crops and fodder or imported breeds Promote tested species/breeds or hybrid seeds hat produce infertile offspring Effects on homes and property Completion of land acquisition and compensation tasks as detailed in the Resettlement Plan Effects on homes and property Completion of land acquisition and compensation tasks as detailed in the Resettlement Plan Effects of the construction of temporary vehicle access track. Completion of land acquisition and compensation tasks as detailed in the Resettlement Plan Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 65 Temporary closure of the irrigation system Selection of the alignment of the access track to minimize extent of earthworks, necessary; securing of agreements with affected landowners Release of silt Adequate supervision of the works, (confining excavation works to the dry months, discretionary use of silt traps where warranted and careful placing of excavated material Dusts and noise generation Wetting of excavation sites and stockpiled material during dry and windy weather, when within 50m of an occupied dwelling Effects of intensified agricultural production instruction in purchase and use of pesticides, promotion of the informed use of mineral fertilizers, promotion of the concept of integrated pest management, and emphatic discouragement of the use of persiste nt herbicides/ pesticides Obstruction of water flows in the canals from sediment or other deposits Support to water user groups so that users discourage or prevent any placing of material or solid waste in the canals 167. Similarly, the impacts of issues relating to Component B - Enhanced Agriculture Commercialization are listed and the identified impact mitigation measures can be used during implementation stages. The following table shows the impacts and mitigation measures. Potential Impacts/Issues Mitigation Measures Enhanced Agriculture Commercialization Increase quality of agricultural wastes Solid waste such as rice husk, corn core Potential make composting and use as organic - fertilizer. Safety issues Training and demonstrate the procedure of post- harvest equipment for end users Dust, noise pollutions and rice husk waste are present from milling but considered slight in their effect on human health and environment larger mill need to install bag house. Rice husk can be composting and use as organic fertilizer. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 66 Increase yield and avoid using more chemical fertilizer Train farmer to improve rice seed and rice production technique Misuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides negatively affect soil and water quality, causing health and polluti on problems. Removed pressure to forest increases biodiversity Train farmers on environmentally appropriate farming practices. Promote organic fertilizers and integrated pest management techniques Waste water from Vegetable packaging Clean technology to reuse water for cleansing purpose (counter flow) and minimize waste will be applied. Social. Mitigation measures 168. The project will try to avoid all adverse impact, particularly physical resettlement, as a result of construction operations related to rehabilitation of irrigation channels. Avoidance of such impact could be done through selection of appropriate engineeri ng design. However, since avoidance of such impact is not always possible, some permanent and temporary impact - related to land acquisition and construction operation, are anticipated. These impacts would affect local people's land, production activities, and livelihoods - either permanently or temporarily, or both for some cases. However, given the nature of the rehabilitation works (which focus on existing structures), these impacts are estimated to be minor, localized, and as such, manageable and revers ible. 169. Where avoidance of such adverse impact is not possible, affected people will be consulted with and compensated for the impact in accordance with project's Compensation & Resettlement Policy Framework (CRPF). Subprojects (to be identified during project implementation) that result in the above impact will prepare a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) in accordance with guidance provided in the CRPF. An abbreviated RAP will be prepared (instead of a full RAP) in case the number of affected people are le ss than 200 persons and there is no physical resettlement of people (Please see CRPF for detailed guidance). 170. In case where ethnic peoples are adversely affected as a result of land acquisition, or construction operations, they will be consulted in a free, prior and informed manner - as per project's EGEF, and are compensated for the loss of assets, and/or income in accordance with CRPF. Consultation with ethnic peoples will be conducted in the form of a social assessment - in line with the project's EGEF. The livelihoods restoration of the affected ethnic peoples is subject to project's monitoring and evaluation until a full recovery is confirmed. Potential risks for ethnic groups: 171. For the potential risks related to potential limited effectiveness of proj ect activities that target ethnic groups because of the lack of intervention methods that could fully and appropriately address the existing socio -cultural constraints of target ethnic groups so as to promote adoption of project recommended farming practic es, free, prior and information consultation will be maintained during project implementation - for all project activities that target ethnic groups. This aims to assure Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 67 sociocultural concerns/constraints of target ethic groups are brought into considerati on when designing and implementing intervention methods for specific activities , such as agricultural extension trainings, participation in productive partnerships, management of irrigation systems. Please see also Recommendation 1 (Section 5.2) for the ap proach to promote participation and ownership of project beneficiaries, including ethnic groups, to ensure activities provided to ethnic groups are culturally appropriate to them. 172. For the potential loss of land or access to resources in relation to mapping , demarcation, and registration of irrigation land/systems in the project area on a block basis (e.g. the process disregarding land under customary management and/or fallows). The risk is anticipated to be low because of the nature of the exercise will be primarily field observation and measurements - at land block basis. No physical intervention to land and on -farm activities of the farmers are envisaged. In cases where loss of land or limited access to farming resources arise as a result of this exercise, consultation with affected households will be conducted as per CRPF (as per EGEF for the case of affected ethnic households). Compensation will be made to affected households as per project's CRPF if such potential impact happen. Approach to enhance deve lopment effectiveness. 173. As the World Bank focuses on the development effectiveness, and project's impact, it's important the following aspects be considered and mainstreamed throughout the project implementation. 174. Inclusion . Poor farming households, including poor ethnic groups, may potentially left behind in a way they could not become project beneficiaries in productive partnership, for instance, because of their small farm size, remote geographical location (hardly accessible), limited farming prac tices, cultural norms, and existing farming practices. Given this, criteria should be developed to provide opportunities for households who meet the criteria of participation into the productive partnership to receive benefit from the project. Criteria sho uld be developed and be part of the Project Operations Manual to facilitate implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The World Bank Group defines social inclusion as: (a) The process of improving the terms for individuals and groups to take part in society, and (b) The process of improving the ability, opportunity, and dignity of those disadvantaged based on their identity to take part in society. 175. Social inclusion is an integral part of \u2014and vital to \u2014achieving the World Bank Group's twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. To ensure the project promote social inclusion, the following aspects should be implemented carefully and consistently over the course of the project. 176. Participation Criteria . To ensure poor households and ethnic min ority who meet minimum participation criteria have opportunity to benefit from the project, considerable weights should be given to criteria checklist to encourage the participation and the chance of success for poor/ethnic minority households who are keen to participate in productive partnerships. 177. Participation Preparedness . There may be households who meet all participation criteria but are not qualified in terms of farming experience/technology to meet the technical requirements set out by the productive partnerships. When screening for participation, these households should be Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 68 encouraged to attend training series - on both technical expertise and business protocol so that they could prepare themselves better. The project should also have such a preparedness plan improve the chance of success for farmers participating the partnerships. 178. Consultations . Meaningful consultations can contribute to improved design, implementation, and sustainability of development interventions. The objectives of cons ultation with project stakeholders, particularly with project beneficiaries include receiving input for improved decision - making about the design and implementation arrangements of a development project, to contribute to improved results and sustainability . In this context, consultations can potentially give voice to the needs of different target groups, including vulnerable and marginalized groups; improve risk management by identifying opportunities and risks from and to a project (World Bank, 2012b); and increase transparency, public understanding, and citizen involvement in development decision -making. Consultations with key stakeholders also including project -affected people and civil societies. While consultations are frequently used during World Bank project preparation, engagement is less systematic during implementation. 179. The Bank suggested that consultation should start with clear subject and purpose, adequate stakeholder representation and methods of consultation, and disclosure of and timely acces s to understandable, relevant, and objective information and documentation. Meaningful consultations also require stakeholder identification and analysis, including due consideration of representativeness and inclusion of women, disadvantaged, vulnerable g roups, ethnic minority peoples. In addition, safeguard policies require adequate documentation of consultations as part of the project documentation. Consultation should also be informed well ahead of the event to enable par ticipants to prepare themselves. 180. Governments need to make relevant information available to citizens in accessible and understandable formats, and to build the capacity and systems to provide adequate responses to citizen feedback. Citizens need to acquire minimum skills to engage, and they need to be interested in the issue. 181. Information disclosure . Open access to information does automatically lead to participation and impact, which also depend on such context factors as enabling legislation and grassroots activism. Information formats and activities need to be part of the design of citizen engagement processes and be based on an understanding of the target audience. Project information will be posted at community centers as well as disseminated through community meetings to ensure farm ing households who are potential beneficiaries of the project could study and participate as they wish. The Bank will ensure people in the project area have access to project's information to determine how they participate in the project activities. As a g ood practice, the Bank's suggested that the information provided be relevant (responsive to citizens' interests), timely (sufficient notice), and understandable (language, format, and local context). 182. Languages . Ethnic minority groups may be potentially e xcluded simply because the language used during information sessions, consultation meetings, trainings, project planning sessions are not in the language that they use on a daily basis. According to World Bank (2013, Inclusion Matters), language is an impo rtant aspect of identity and claim to political and cultural space. Language can thus be an important driver of both exclusion and inclusion. Thus, consideration should be given to frequent use of local languages during consultation, meetings, and training s with the participation of ethnic minority groups. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 69 183. Sociocultural norms . Social norms can considerably affect that way men and women participate in training. Social norms contribute to establishing farming practices. Thus, changing a current farming pract ice mean changing a social norm that is deeply rooted in one's belief system, which may affect farmers' social network that is close to them, such as their family members, relatives, friends, neighbors, their business partners. Women in Laos spend remarkab le amount of time doing house chore and farm works. They are considered appropriate more for the household role. As such, more men (than women) attend events (meetings, trainings, etc.) outside their home. Under the project, depending on the training topic s, women should be encouraged to participate as they apply the knowledge to make a joint decision with their husband. 184. Grievance Redress Mechanisms (GRM) . GRMs are increasingly recognized as a means to address complaints early on and manage risks in proje ct preparation and implementation before they escalate providing multiple channels for soliciting complaints; registering complaints in a log; publishing timely and service standards for acknowledgement, response, and resolution; and ensuring transparency about the grievance procedure as well as options for mediation and appeal. The capacity of local and national institutions to address grievances also needs to be assessed. Staff training on GRMs is being rolled out. 185. Gender Mainstreaming . Women play an imp ortant role in agricultural production. However, most of the time and effort they made usually go unnoticed. By having women participating more in capacity development activities, particularly in technical trainings, women can improve crop yield, diversify their crops, and thus, increase their income and family's nutritional status. Promoting the participation in agricultural production and agribusiness are important in the context of the changing market in Laos that requires higher quality of farm produce, and stable supply to develop the supply and value chain. A specific action plan for gender mainstreaming is of high importance - not only for households who are affected because of land acquisition but also for households who benefit from agricultural tra ining and productive partnerships (Please see Gender Action Plan and Monitoring Plan from Annex 3 of Social Assessment report, and the suggestive Gender Action Plan for land affected households at Annex 4 of Social Assessment report. 8.0 GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES (GAP), INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM); PEST MANAGEMENT PLAN (PMP) AND SUSTAINABLE FARMING PRACTICES 8.1. Good Agricultural Practices 186. GAP in Lao PDR is currently focused on food safety, sustainability for the environment , and economic sustainability. A multiplicity of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) codes, standards and regulations have been developed in recent years by the food industry and producers' organizations , as well as by governments and NGOs, who have all aime d to codify agricultural practices at farm level for a range of commodities. Their purpose varies from fulfilment of trade and government regulatory requirements ( with particular regard to food safety and quality), to more specific requirements of specialt y or niche markets. The objective of these GAP codes, standards , and regulations include (to a varying degree ): Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 70 ensuring safety and quality of produce in the food chain capturing new market advantages by modifying supply chain governance improving natur al resources use, workers' health and working conditions, and/or creating new market opportunities for farmers and exporters in developing countries. 187. Good Agricultural Practices are \"practices that address environmental, economic and social sustainabilit y for on -farm processes, and result in safe and quality food and non -food agricultural products\" (FAO COAG 2003 GAP paper). These four 'pillars' of GAP (economic viability, environmental sustainability, social acceptability and food safety and quality) are included in most private and public sector standards, but the scope which they actually cover varies widely. The concept of Good Agricultural Practices may serve as a reference tool for deciding, at each step in the production process, on practices and/or outcomes that are environmentally sustainable and socially acceptable. The implementation of GAP should therefore contribute to Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Development (SARD). 188. At present, agricultural farming in Lao PDR is still largely subsistent o r low input - low output. According to the government's 8th NSEDP, the future push of the agriculture sector is on commercialization based on land -use planning, focusing on rice self -sufficiency, and aiming to increase yields of key prioritized commodities for domestic consumption and export. This is the current trend and it will be accelerated in the coming years. However, agriculture commercialization in a country where 70% of the labor force is employed by the agriculture sector with average landholdings of 1-2 hectares is not straightforward. This requires nuanced efforts to ensure the expected efficiency, equitability, and sustainability. Lessons learned from neighboring countries in the region indicated that increased use of inputs in farming do not ne cessarily result in increase in profits and incomes for farmers. Lessons from rice farming Vietnam showed that farmers used certified seeds and adopted sustainable farming practices (i.e. reduced fertilizers, pesticides, postharvest losses, and water use) could obtain higher profits about 20 -30% thanks to higher quality of paddy, increased yield by 5 -10 percent, and reduced production costs by 20 -30 percent. Therefore, investments and efforts to improve quality and value of agricultural products and reduce postharvest losses and production costs for farmers should be the right direction to enhance competitiveness of farmers and sustainability of the agriculture sector in the long run. 8.2 Integrated Pest Management 189. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) refers to the careful consideration of all available pest control techniques and subsequent integration of appropriate measures that discourage the development of pest populations and keep pesticides and other interventions to levels that are economically justified and reduce or minimize risks to human health and the environment. IPM emphasizes the growth of a healthy crop with the least possible disruption to agro -ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms. 190. Under the Ministry of Agricultural and Fores try, the Plant Protection Centre and its branches in the provinces as well as the Agricultural Extension Centres at district level are the authorities coordinating and working on Integrated Pest Management Programs. The National IPM program was Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 71 initiated with assistance from FAO, DANIDA and other donors since the early 1990s and is largely being continued national resources. 191. IPM activities implemented by these local authorities and technical backstopping by experts from DOA include conducting field survey s, preparing forecasts, monitoring and checking the progress of main pest development in the field. Using the forecast based on the timing, scale and level of damages that the main pest(s) may cause, the provincial plant protection authorities recommend policies, plans, and measures for pest management. 192. They also conduct training to farmers to carry out sets of integrated measures such as pest identification, pest control, conduct pest analysis, pest list and pest surveillance, measure to control and apply chemical and botanical control agent , promote the application of biological measures for pest management, reduce chemicals and practice sustainable IPM. They also provide training for farmers on proper use of chemical pesticide to ensure high efficienc y for pest management, safe for human beings, farm pests and the environment. These authorities also carry out communication campaigns on plant protections and quarantine legislations and advance IPM technics to the farmers etc. 193. Running costs of these p lant protection agencies has been state fund allocations. Their staff also have also working in projects and programs financed from other sources for research and to conduct additional trainings for farmers annually. 194. Pesticide Use and IPM implementation in Project Provinces: A DoA survey in 2014 and nation -wide inspections in 2013 of pesticide and herbicide suppliers in provincial capitals and other main distribution hubs, indicate that the most commonly sold products include: abamectin, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, glyphosate, imidacloprid. In the Northern provinces, where a large part of the herbicide use is on corn and rubber plantations, the main products sold are the herbicides Glyphosate, Paraquat and Atrazine. Nowadays, on Rice and Maize cultivati on farmers don't use pesticide accept some vegetable s. These inspections have also shown that the most problematic highly hazardous products, such as monocrotophos, methyl parathion, methamidophos, mevinphos, endosulfan, etc. , are no longer found on the ma rket with the exception of the occasional old bottle. The only banned products that still are found regularly are paraquat and methomyl. This is because these products were banned only recently (2010) and are still permitted in the neighbouring countries f rom where they are informally brought in by users or retailers. The banning of highly hazardous pesticides in China does not seem to have led to dumping of old stocks in Lao PDR. There are no known large stocks of obsolete pesticides. 195. Insecticides are use d mainly on vegetables (such as Long Yard Bean, Chilly, Cabbage, Chinese Cabbage) marketable high -value crops and plantation crops, notably rubber. Field surveys by the national IPM programme and DoA indicate there still is wide -spread abuse of pesticides among farmers. Lack of knowledge among farmers is a major constraint. Abuse includes mixing without justification (just to be sure), use of wrong pesticides, use of wrong dosages, etc. Adequate protective gear is hardly being used. Shops often have gloves and masks for sale, but these tend to be inadequate for protection against hazardous chemicals. Buyers of pesticides rarely also buy protective gear and shops do not provide it for free. Half used pesticide bottles or packages are often stored within the house or near homesteads, often in easy reach of children. Empty pesticide containers are often Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 72 discarded at the border of fields or in drainage ditches. 196. The DoA Plant Protection Centre (and its national IPM programme ) has developed a 3 -day curriculum for a Farmer Training on Pesticide Risk Reduction (FT -PRR) which is intended to raise awareness, develop capacity and help rural communities formulate and implement their own action plans for pesticide risk reduction. As of June 2014, some 4,900 Lao farmers (i ncluding 1,600 women) have participated in FT -PRR courses in 149 villages of 34 Districts in 9 provinces. 197. Season -long Integrated Pest Management training through Farmers Field Schools (FFS) often includes these short -duration FT -PRR courses. These FFSs allow farmers to learn about and adopt Integrated Pest Management as to reduce overuse of pesticides in crop production. 198. The National IPM Programme has implemented 806 season -long IPM Farmers Field Schools, with over 24,350 rice, vegetable and fruit farmers trained. More, however, remains to be done. Pesticide Risk Reduction and IPM adoption at farm level remain s a priority for the Government. 199. As per the International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides, the following rules are observed for IPM: The standards of conduct set forth in this Code: 1.7.6. are designed to promote Integrated Pest Management (IPM) (including integrated vector management for public health pests); Concerted efforts should be made by governments to develop and promote the use of IPM. Furthermore, lending institutions, donor agencies and governments should support the development of national IPM policies and improved IPM concepts and practices. These should be based on scientific and other strategies that promote increased participation of farmers (including women's groups), extension agents and on -farm researchers. All s takeholders, including farmers and farmer associations, IPM researchers, extension agents, crop consultants, food industry, manufacturers of biological and chemical pesticides and application equipment, environmentalists and representatives of consumer gro ups should play a proactive role in the development and promotion of IPM. Governments, with the support of relevant international and regional organizations, should encourage and promote research on, and the development of, alternatives posing fewer risks: biological control agents and techniques, non -chemical pesticides and pesticides that are, as far as possible or desirable, target -specific, that degrade into innocuous constituent parts or metabolites after use and are of low risk to humans and the envir onment. Governments should: 5.1.7 provide extension and advisory services and farmers' organizations with adequate information about practical IPM strategies and methods, as well as the range of pesticide products available for use. Governments should: 8. 1.4 ensure that any pesticide subsidies or donations do not lead to excessive or unjustified use which may divert interest from more sustainable alternative measures. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 73 8.3 Pest Management Plan 200. It is anticipated that there will be no procurement of pesticides under the project and that pesticide use, overall, will decline as a result with the introduction of good agricultural practices. That said, pesticides are being used by farmers in the proje ct area, so this plan will be applied to the project activities involving any changes in agricultural practices and/or rehabilitation of or development of existing irrigation schemes that may prompt farmers to increase their use of pesticides if no trainin g or monitoring is provided. The plan is comprised of three parts: (i) application of government regulation on pesticide control; (ii) training of the integrated pesticides concept and/or other approaches for the safe use of pesticides; and (iii) monitori ng. A full overview of Regulation Number 2860/MAF is available in Annex 2, and a simplified PMP is available in Annex 3. Both should be consulted for any subprojects under the LACP. 8.4 Sustainable Farming Practices 201. There are several sustainable farmi ng practices that can be used in conjunction with IPM and GAP.

In order to ensure that the environmental and social issues are addressed properly in accordance and in compliance with the World Bank Safeguards Policies, all project activities in particular small scale infrastructure in particular construction of seed sto rage facilities, value added processing facilities and rehabilitation of existing irrigation schemes ( main, secondary and tertiary canals and drainages) shall undergo screening, assessment, review, and clearance process before execution of the physical activities. The project will use a structured approach to environmental and social management to allow the project development process, follow the hierarchy of avoidance, minimization, compensation/mitigation for negative impacts and enhancement of positive i mpacts where practically feasible and advantageous. This chapter describes the process for ensuring that environmental and social concerns are adequately addressed through the institutional arrangements and procedures used by the project for managing the i dentification, preparation, approval, and implementation of subprojects. 203. Detailed environmental and social safeguard process are as follows: Table 1 8: Steps for E&S Screening, E&S impact Assessment, Appraisal, Monitoring and Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 74 Reporting LACP E&S Capacity & Sub-projects Process Responsible Entity/person Resource / Toolkit * Step 1: E&S Screening and Review 1.1 Eligible screening Check against non -eligible activities 1.2 E&S Impact /Risk screening Screening site sensitivity to identify potential issues; Identify sub -project Category and if safeguard instrument will be required.

This screening is essential to quickly assess potential environmental and social impacts of the subproject interventions. The screening identifies the consequence s of the proposed subprojects in the broader sense , without having very much detailed investigation. Critical issues are also identified through the screening which needs detailed investigation during the impact assessment. Based on the extent of environmental and social impact obtained from the screening result, the decision for further environment and social impact assessment will be taken. The screening includes eligibility screening and E&S impact screening for assessment of potential impacts, policies triggered and instruments to be prepared. The E&S impact screening needs to be carried out all the major components of the subprojects. 9.1.1 Eligibility Safeguard Screening 205. The project aims at impr oving good agriculture practices and critical infrastructure (storage facilities, rice mill, value added processing facilities, and improving of irrigation channels, pumping station, etc.) in selected areas to support development of commercial agriculture. This is done through (a) finance missing elements for improving good agriculture practices and critical infrastructure for farmer groups, agri -business as well as rehabilitation of public infrastructure to improve operation and efficiency of existing irr igation systems (pumping stations and irrigation channels, etc.) ; (b) introducing various irrigation models aiming at reducing operating costs and improving water Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 76 productivity; (c) support establishment and strengthening of water user groups to effectivel y operate and maintain existing infrastructure. Screening will be based on an assessment of project components and site sensitivity. List of non -eligible activities was provided in Annex 1. It is not anticipated that sub-project activities that required IE E as per Lao PDR Law will be proposed as project activities due to its small scale in nature . However, if the plantation of industrial crops more than 20 hectares , an IEE need to be prepared and submitted to PoNRE for its clearance prior to the project implementation. And plantation of industrial crops more than 400 hectares will require EIA and clearance by MoNRE. The project will finance IEE required sub -projects with the condition that IEE was approved by PoNRE prior to sub -project implementation. 9.1.2 E&S Screening (Determination of sub -project Category and Safeguard Instrument Requirement) 206. After subprojects are determined to be eligible for financing, a E&S impact screening will be carried o ut. The purposes of the E&S screening are to: (i) ident ify the World Bank safeguard policies triggered; (ii) classify subprojects into B or C categories as per site sensitivity matrix in Table 1 9 and Guidance to classify level of impact from the sub -project activities; and (iii) to determine if the safeguard instrument needs to be prepared for the sub -project. 207. The screening also provides brief descriptions of the nature and extent of potential negative impacts on natural and environmental resources and local people related to land acquisition, resettlement, l and donation, and/or involvement with ethnic minority. For the Category C sub -project, no safeguard instrument will be required and Table 3 form in Annex 5 will be filled up as an attachment to the sub -project proposal. For the sub -project type that requir es IEE, it is likely to be classified as Category B sub -project. However, it is unlikely that the proposed sub -project activities i.e. irrigation canal improvement, rice mill and its storage facilities improvement, vegetable packaging facilities improvemen t and agriculture farming will be required IEE. Table 1 Annex 5 will be used to screen agriculture farming sub-project category and assess the project and identify type of safeguard instrument needs to be prepared and implemented by the sub -project. Table 2 Annex 5 will be used to screen project category for the proposed improved value added facilities such as rice mill, storage facilities and vegetable packaging facilities. 208. For the proposed irrigated areas, downstream of dam, the sub -project implementati on need to be on hold until the Panel of Expert (POE) completed the dam inspection and provided recommendation to proceed without any remedial work or safety -related measures necessary to upgrade the existing dam or DUC to an acceptable standard of safety. MAF has drafted TOR for POE as shown in Annex 7. MAF will take an action follow the POE recommendations at their own cost. Dam safety related procedures is shown in Annex 8. Table 1 9: Site Sensitivity and Safeguard Policies SITE SENSITIVITY Safeguard Policy or Site Characteristic Low Sensitivity Medium Sensitivity High Sensitivity Natural Habitats No natural habitats No critical natural habitats; Critical natural habitats present Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 77 9.2 Step 2 : Impact Assessment (Determination Type of Safeguard Instrument Requirements) 209. After an E&S impact screening was conducted and the sub -project Category was identified, the sub-project category B detailed impact assessment will be carried out. The purpose of the impact assessment is to identify from the level of the impact and determine the type of safeguard instrument that needs to be prepared for the subproject (e.g. IEE, or ESMP or ECOP). The impact assessment will be used as an input to set scope of mitig ation measures. The impact assessment will give the environment and social issues due importance in the decision -making process by clearly evaluating the environmental and social consequences of the proposed sub -project before action is taken. Early identi fication and characterization of critical environmental and social impacts allows the public and the government to form a view about the environmental and social acceptability of a proposed development sub -project and what conditions should apply to mitiga te or minimize those risks and impacts. The scope of the impact assessment will depend on the screening results. Data collection, field survey, and consultation with local communities and affected population will be carried out. 210. As the project activities are small scale in nature , it is unlikely that the proposed sub-project activities will be classified as Category A of which will require EIA. For the sub -project category B, it (OP 4.04) present of any kind other natural habitats occur Forest (OP 4.36) No production, conservation and protection forest present of any kind Production forest present but no conservation and protection forest present Conservation and protection forest present Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11) No known or suspected physical cultural resources as per OP 4.11 including sacred grove present No physical cultural resources (PCR) as per OP 4.11 including sacred grove present but has historical record from villagers or local authorities' potential to chance find the PCR Physical cultural resources as per OP 4.11 including sacred grove present Resettlement (OP 4.12) No new sites are required. Project site is already acquired and is free of squatter; legal tenure is well- defined. Project site has tenant renters. Yet to be acquired. Project site will entail resettlement of vulnerable or required land more than 10% of agriculture land Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10) No indigenous population Dispersed and mixed indigenous populations; mainstream (highly acculturated) indigenous populations Indigenous territories and reserves; vulnerable indigenous populations Natural hazards vulnerability; floods, soil stability/erosion Flat terrain; no potential stability/erosion problems; no known volcanic/seismic/flood risks Medium slopes; some erosion potential. Medium risks to erosion. volcanic/seismic/flood/ hurricanes Mountainous terrain; steep slopes; unstable soils; high erosion and land slide potential; volcanic, seismic or flood risks Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 78 is unlikely that IEE will be required as agriculture farming will be less than 20 hectares. ECOP, RAPs and/or EGDPs will be prepared in line with this ESMF, Compensation & Resettlement Policy Framework (CRPF) and/or the Ethnic Groups Engagement Framework (EGEF) which has been developed for the Project. Due attention should also be given to address the issues related to gender, ethnic groups, and other disadvantaged groups, especially when they are likely to be affected by the natural disaster. 211. In brief, depending on the resul ts of the screening exercise and level of the Category B -sub- project impact, following documents will be required at subproject level: Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) Environmental Codes of Practice (ECOP); Resettlement Action Plan (RAP); Ethnic Group Development Plan (EGDP); Gender Action Plan, including Gender Monitoring Plan that are integrated into any applicable instruments (RAP/EGDP). Table 20 Definition of required subprojects' safeguard document Type of Category B Sub - Project Level of I mpact Required Safeguard Instruments Type and size of project that required IEE Likely significant negative impact that can be mitigated through appropriate mitigation measures Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) Type and size of project that not required IEE Moderately negative impact that can be mitigated through appropriate mitigation measures Environmental and Social Management Plan Type and size of project that not required IEE Low negative impact that can easily mitigate through code of practices to be attached as part of contractor contract Environmental Code of Practices 212. The key steps of impact assessment are: planning, scoping, impact assessment and consultation. The impact assessment will clarify: (i) how will the particular sub -project activity give rise to an impact? (ii) how likely is it that an impact will occur? (iii) what will be the consequence of each impact? and (iv) what will be the spatial and temporal extent of each impact? The assessment of impacts largely depends on the extent and duration of change, the number of people or size of the resource affected and their sensitivity to the change. Potential impacts can be both negative and positive (beneficial), and the methodology defined in Step 3 will be applied to define bot h beneficial and adverse potential impacts and propose mitigation measures. 9.3 Step 3 : Appraisal with Environmental and Social Safeguard Instrument Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 79 213. After the sub -project categorization and the safeguard instrument/s is/are identified, those instruments will be prepared and completed before project implementation. Annex 5: STEP 3 - provided Environment Code of Practices (ECOP) related to the four type of potential sub-project activities. Mitigation Measures and Public Consultation 214. Mitigation Measures : Appropriate mitigation measures will be identified according to the nature and extent of the potential negative impacts. ECOP for specific ty pe of sub -projects will be used to minimize adverse impacts and enhance positive impacts. For all Category B subprojects to be impleme nted under the project, the ECOP should be a part of the Contract Document. 215. Public Consultation : Preparation and impleme ntation of the subproject safeguards documents during project preparation need to follow the Bank requirements for public consultation under OP 4.01. The objectives of consultation are to generate public awareness by providing information about a sub - proje ct to all stakeholders, particularly the sub -projects affected persons (PAPs) in a timely manner and to provide opportunity to the stakeholders to voice their opinions and concerns on different aspects of the project. Consultation would help facilitate and streamline decision making whilst fostering an atmosphere of understanding among individuals, groups and organizations, who could affect or be affected by the subprojects. 216. Consultation is a continuous process by which opinion from public is sought on mat ters affecting them. The opinions and suggestions of the stakeholders would assist PAFO in taking appropriate decisions for effective environmental and social management of the sub -projects. It would help facilitate and streamline decision making whilst fo stering an atmosphere of understanding among individuals, groups and organizations, who could affect or be affected by the sub -projects. The specific objectives of public consultation are: To keep stakeholders informed about the sub -projects at different stages of implementation, To address the environmental and social concerns/impacts, and device mitigation measures taking into account the opinion/ suggestions of the stakeholders, To generate and document broad community support for the sub -projects, To improve communications among in terested parties; and To establish formal complaint submittal/resolution mechanisms. 217. At least 2 stages consultation with the project affected people, project beneficiary and relevant stakeholders will need to be carried out. The first stage consultation for environmental and social impact assessment is required during the subproject E&S screening level. And second level consultation should be carried out once the impacts are clearly identified and draft management plan are pr epared. If required, more than two consultations should be carried out. The following are the guidelines for carrying out consultation: The mode of consultation will be either public consultation (PC) or focus group discussion (FGD). The consultative meeti ng or discussion will provide opportunity to the participants to raise their concerns freely about the sub -projects and their impacts on their life, livelihood and their community as a whole. Discussion will also be focused on subproject(s) specific enviro nment and social issue, so that stakeholders can contribute their knowledge on better environmental and social management. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 80 The composition of participants may differ depending on the nature and location of the sub - projects. A stakeholder analysis needs to be carried out to identify the key stakeholders and Project Affected Persons (PAPs). Depending on the social formation and interest of different groups, separate meetings should be organized. Information on the PC/FGD needs to be announced locally using loud speakers and putting notices in public important places at least 7 to 10 days prior to the consultations. In general, i t must be ensured that the PAPs and other stakeholders are informed and consulted about the sub - project, its impact, their entitlements and options, and allowed to participate actively in the development of the sub -project. This should be done particularly in the case of vulnerable PAPs, such as affected ethnic groups. This exercise should be conducted throughout the sub - project preparation, implementation, and monitoring stages. An open -door policy should be maintained for community people, so that stakeho lders feel comfortable approaching PAFO/DAFO directly to ask questions and raise concerns on environmental and social issues. Create a responsive management system should be created for recording and responding to comments and concern on environmental and social issues. It should be ensured that the PAFO/DAFO and its consultant capable of responding to questions/comments, appropriately. 9.4 Step 4 : Monitoring and Reporting 218. Monitoring Plan : The primary objective of the environmental and social monitoring is to record environmental and social impacts resulting from the sub -project activities and to ensure implementation of the \"mitigation measures\" identified earlier to reduce adverse impact s and enhance positive impacts from project activities. Apart from general monitoring of mitigation/enhancement measures, important environmental and social parameters will be monitored during the construction and operation phases of the subprojects. The r equirement and frequency of monitoring would depend on the extent and scope of sub-project and field situation. Matrix of monitoring screening was shown in Annex 5: STEP 4 - Monitoring and Reporting. RAP Monitoring 219. Monitoring is a continuous evaluation pro cess of the project implementation which is related to the unified implementation schedule on the use of the project inputs, infrastructures and services. Monitoring provides concerned agencies with continuous reflections on the implementation status. Moni toring determines the reality, successful possibility and arising difficulties as soon as possible to facilitate the due adjustment in the project implementation. Monitoring includes 2 following purposes: (i) Monitor whether the project activities complete efficiently or not, including quantity, quality and time. (ii) Assess whether these activities reach the objectives and purpose of the Project or not, and how much do they reach. 220. The executive agency (DPIF) as well as the independent monitoring Consultan ts which are contracted with the DPIF shall monitor and supervise the RAP implementation regularly. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 81 Internal Monitoring 221. Internal monitoring of the RAP implementation of the Sub -projects is the main responsibility of the implementation agency with the ass istance of the project consultants. The implementation agency will monitor the progress of RAP preparation and implementation throughout the regular progress reports. The criteria of internal monitoring include but not limit (i) Compensation payment fo r affected households for the different types of damage pursuant to the compensation policies described in the resettlement plans (ii) Implementation of technical assistance, relocation, allowance payment and relocation assistance. (iii) Implementation of income recovery and entitlement to recovery assistance. (iv) Dissemination of information and consultation procedures. (v) Monitoring of complaint procedures, existing problems that require the manageable attention. (vi) Prioritizing affected person s on the proposed selections. (vii) In coordination to complete RAP activities and award construction contract. 222. The executive agencies will collect information every month from the different resettlement committees. A database tracking the resettlement i mplementation of the Project will be maintained and updated monthly. The executive agencies will submit internal monitoring reports on the RAP implementation as a part of the quarterly report they are supposed to submit the WB. The reports should contain t he following information: (i) Number of affected persons according to types of effect and project component and the status of compensation, relocation and income recovery for each item. (ii) The distributed costs for the activities or for compensation payment and disbursed cost (iii) for each activity. (iv) List of outstanding Complaints (v) Final results on solving complaints and any outstanding issues that demand management agencies at all levels to solve. (vi) Arisen issues in the implementation process. (vii) RP Schedule is actually updated. 10.0 IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS Project Management Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 82 223.

Project DOPC (MAF), DPC (MOIC), PAFO MAF & MOIC technical departments Notes : Primary responsible agencies are responsible for making decisions for project implementation; supporting agencies will provide technical advice and collaborate when necessary, but will not possess any approval powers for project implementation. Incorporation of ESMF into Project Operational Manual 238. For smooth planning, implementation and supervision, a Project Operational Manual (POM) will be prepared before the inception of the Project. The POM will have sections on envir onmental issues/procedures, resettlement and compensation and ethnic minorities plans. These sections will provide links to: (i) subproject screening; (ii) appropriate mitigation actions and/or ECOP ; (iii) practical pre-tested safeguard forms used at field subproject level; (iv) development of supplemental tools/guidance; (v) details on how monitoring and evaluation for safeguards will be undertaken; and(vi) definition and role of third party auditing. The consultant responsible for preparing the ESMF will ensure that the above areas are well covered in the POM. 12.0 CAPACITY BUILDING 12.1 Justification of institutional capacity assessment 239. Effective implementation of this Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) will require technical capacity in the human resource base of implementing institutions as well as logistical facilitation. Implementers need to understand inherent social and environmental issues and values and be able to clearly identify indicators of these. Even with existence of policie s and laws such as the Environmental Protection Law (EPL, 2013) evidence on the ground, still indicates that there is significant shortcoming in the abilities of local and district level stakeholders to correctly monitor, mitigate and manage environmental performance of development projects. 240. Sufficient understanding of the mechanisms for implementing the ESMF will need to be provided to the various stakeholders implementing subprojects of LACP . This will be important to Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 87 support the teams appreciate their role in providing supervision, monitoring and evaluation including environmental reporting on the projects activities. 241. During the ESMF preparation, the overall capacity at central level and provinc ial level has been reviewed. There are few officials who have professional training and affiliation with safeguard operation. In order to ensure proper E SMF implementation and supervision, additional consultant support required both at provincial and centr al level during the project implementation phase. However, MAF will also support in developing its staff capacity on environmental and social issues utilizing the project technical assistance provision. 12.2 Human Resource Capacity Requirements 242. Human capac ity challenges for stakeholders involved in the implementation of the ESMF are of two types: Low technical capacity of current staff, and Inadequate (low) numbers of staff. 243. While adequacy in staffing requirements was found to be varied between the various stakeholders, there is very limited presence of directly trained and dedicated staff for environmental and social management purposes within institutions, in particular at the local levels. Staffs from other departments are usually assi gned duties related to environmental and social management. As a result, sufficient knowledge on environmental and social management principles, project screening, impact mitigation, monitoring and follow up action was limited within most institutions. In many institutions, staffs have been retained for core activities leaving little if any human resources to directly oversee environmental and social management activities. As a result, this portfolio which in many cases is given little attention is handled by staff members not adequately conversant with it. 12.3 Capacity Building and Training 244. Education and training of the agency staff and the dam owner are important elements of any program. Newer staff needs training focused on dam safety engineering. Beca use state -of-the-practice technology for dam design, construction, and inspection activities is constantly changing, even experienced professional and technical staffs must be continually educated in these new techniques and trained in their use. Various l evels and types of education and training can be employed to keep staff personnel up to date in their particular areas of expertise. 245. Awareness creation, training and sensitization will be required for personnel of the following institutions: DOA, DAEC, PAFO DOA, DAEC, Environment and Social Management Framework Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 88 DAEC, DaLaM, DOPC, PAFO Community Implementing Units e.g. women's Unions, youth unions, leaders of ethnic groups, Contractors managers and personnel Private Sector millers personnel 246. Training will concern: Environmental and social impact screening process and using ESMF screening forms/checklist o Screening process o Assignment of environmental categories o Rationale for using Environmental and Social Checklists o The importance of public consultations and particip ation of households in the screening and planning process o How to monitor ESMF implementation Safeguard policies, procedures, and sectoral guidelines o Review and discussion of national environmental policies, procedures, and legislation o Review and discussion of the Bank's safeguard policies Selected topics on environmental protection and social safeguards o Air, water, and soil pollution o Health and safety o Waste management and disposal o Natural resource utilization o Selection of viable, small and medium -scale enterprises o GAP, IPM and Pest Management Plan 247. Selection of training courses should identify potential guidelines or good practice documents on environmental management for the key sectors to be financed. The objective is to help staffs move beyond just co mpliance to cleaner production and improved environmental sustainability that would help reduce costs (e.g., due to use of less water and energy, generation of less wastes, etc.) and potential environmental problems. World Bank environmental safeguard spec ialists will provide periodic supervision and training relative to the identification and management of environmental risk in project evaluation and implementation. 248. During the implementation, further capacity development need assessment will be carried o ut and the capacity building program will be redesigned according to the need and targeted improvement in project implementation. 13.0 COSTS AND BUDGET Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 89 13.1 ESMF implementation 249. As the technical details of sub -projects have not yet been finalized for the project investments, an estimated lump sum amount has been designated to address the potential number of IEE, ECOP which will have to be prepared as well as monitoring requirement s for the ESMF. Table shows an estimate and will need to be updated once the sub -project proposals have been finalized during project implementation. Activity Budget Dam inspection for Rehabili tation irrigation canal downstream of 5 dams $30,000/scheme Preparation of IEE/E COP $70,000/scheme Budget for Implementation of each ESM F, monitoring and reporting $25,000/year Training on IPM /Pest Management Plan implementation $10,000/year Training on GAP, soil conservation, water management $70,000 /year 1-day training for highlighting potential environmental and social impacts and mitigation measures (project launch workshop) $5,000/training Technical assistance (international consultant) $50,000 for first year 13.2 Monitoring program 250. The monitoring program will be concentrate d on key indicators of the possible adverse impact identify by the environmental impact assessment, in particular surface water quality downstream of irrigation canal, water quality in public well. The estimated an nual cost of such monitoring program is about US$20,000/scheme. Identification and quantification of environmental indicators will be done during project implementation of which the monitoring program will be prepared in adequate detail, setting out the lo cation and frequency of measurements, parameters to be measures and tested. Training and capacity building for E COP monitor will be provided by Bank experts. 251. The PMU and E&S consultant will help farmer by provide advice and supervise the implementation o f the environmental code of practices as well as contract qualified laboratory for the monitoring, including the laboratory testing and reporting. The PMU will check with PoNRE to determine if the project implementation is meeting all specified ESMF, ECOP and related social safeguard requirement. These measures will be complemented by the participatory M&E under which project affected people and direct beneficiaries report issues they experience to the project. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 90 252. The PMU and E&S consultant in close consulta tion with DAFO/PAFO will also perform supervision site visits during works as well as operation stage of the project to confirm the E COP and social safeguard instruments are being adequately implemented. A supervision report covering the environmental and social management issues should be included in the overall site visit report: a summary of the environmental issues encountered should be reported in the bi -annual Implementation Report to the Bank. The bank will also review these reports during twice implementation support mission. 14.0 GRIEVANCE REDRESS MECHANISM 253. The grievance redress institution/mechanism (GRI/M) is an integral project management element th at intends to seek feedback from beneficiaries and resolve of complaints on project activities and performance. The mechanism will base on World Bank requirements and most important is based on Lao PDR's grievance redress mechanisms to solve the uprising p roblem between project owner and local resident, specially affected person by the subprojects. 254. Affected people, either from ethnic groups or Lao people, share the same Grievance Redress Institutions/Mechanism (GRI/M). 255. Consultation with local people, incl uding members of the affected ethnic group community, if any, will take place early in the process of the project planning. Prior to sub -project commencement, community leaders will consult with members of the affected community and the whole process is to be well documented. 256. To ensure that complaints and grievances from affected peoples can be received, a grievance redress institution/mechanism (GRI/M) will be established within the project affected community based on the existing structure from the villa ge mediation unit (VMU) established in all villages, District Office of Justice (DOJ) and DAFO at district level and the Provincial Assembly and PAFO at the provincial level. These institutions will be used and strengthened to receive, evaluate and facilit ate the resolution of concerns, complaints and grievances emanating from within the affected community in accordance with the Law on Handling of Petitions (2015). 257. For subprojects where members of ethnic groups are affected, VMU at the village level will comprise of ethnic group community leaders representing the affected peoples, and head of mediation unit, or village elder person. The grievance redress institution will function, for the benefit of the members of the ethnic group community, during the ent ire life of the sub -projects, including the defects liability period. 258. Social and environmental related grievances - either from directly or indirectly affected people, (including affected people from ethnic groups) will be resolved through the Grievance R edress Institution/Mechanism (GRI/M) - as indicated in the flowchart at Figure 1 below. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 91 259. However, complainant retains the right to bypass this procedure and as such can direct their grievance directly to the PAFOs or the Provincial Assembly, as provided by law in Lao PDR. At each level within the GRI/M process, discussions and outcomes of logdged complaints will be documented and recorded in a grievance logbook. The status of the grievances submitted and grievance resolution will be reported to PAFOs in mon thly reports. In order to effectively and quickly resolve grievances of PAP, the following process will can be followed: Stage 1 : if PAP and PAH are not satisfied with the resettlement plan or its implementation, PAP and PAH can issue a verbal or written complaint to the Village Mediation Unit or Committee (VMU/C). If it is a verbal complaint, the village should deal with this complaint and document it in a written record. The VMU/C should resolve the complaint or grievance within two weeks or calendar 15 days; Stage 2 : if PAP and PAH are not satisfied with the result in Step 1, PAP and PAH can file an appeal with the District Office of Justice (DOJ) via DAFOs after PAP and PAH receives the decision made in Step 1. The DOJ should make a decision within two weeks or 15 calendar days; Stage 3 : if PAP and PAH are not satisfied with the result of Step 2, PAP and PAH can file an appeal with the Provincial Assembly (PA) via PAFO for administrative arbitration after receiving the decision made by the DOJ. The admin istrative arbitration organization should make the arbitrated decision within 20 calendar days; and Stage 4 : if PAP and PAH are still unsatisfied with the arbitrated decision made by the administrative arbitration organization, after receiving the arbitrat ed decision, PAP and PAH can file a lawsuit in a civil court according to the relevant laws and regulations in Lao PDR. Figure 13 - GRI process Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 92 260. Members of ethnic group communities can make a complaint or appeal on any and all aspects of sub -projects' design and implementation, compensation and resettlement. A complaint and grievance feedback form, as well as a pamphlet explaining the mechanism, wi ll be developed under the project and distributed to ethnic group communities for their use. Ethnic group community members will be clearly informed of the complaint and appeal channels (as described above) in community meetings and other forms of communic ation that are convenient to them. Information and communications technology and media tools should be used to disseminate information. Opinions and suggestions related to resettlement which are provided by concerned people and/or organizations should be w ell documented. Resettlement organizations, at various levels, should study and address any issue in a timely manner.

The ESMF has been prepared through a detailed consultative process both at the field level and central level. 15.2 Consultations at Provincial and Villa ge Levels 262. A consultation taken place at the provincial levels before appraisal mission in November 2017 . These consultations provided valuable information for the project objectives, its components, environmental and social assessment as well as developin g the ESMF. Requirement of consultations at Provincial and Village Levels. 263. The WB requires consultations held with the local community. This consultation should provide information on the following aspects: a) purposes of the project; b) results of the environmental and social assessment; and c) project implementation plan. The results of consultation were summarized in respective documents, including CRPF, EGEF, Social Assessment, and ESMF. 264. Consultation through a community outreach during implementation is a good practice that can be adopted to ensure that the potential negative impacts and concerns are properly addressed during construction and operation of a project. Required extensive consultation with affected population and ethnic mino rity are required when the activities involve land acquisition, temporary environmental impact that affected the income generation activities/livelihoods/agricultural production of local people, including people from ethnic groups. Consultation Process Sum mary. 265. Public consultation was a key component of the LACP and it was pivotal in preparation of the following safeguards documents: Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), Compensation and Resettlement Policy Framework (CRPF), Ethnic Groups En gagement Policy (EGEF), and Social Assessment (SA) report, which include Gender Analysis report integrated into SA. 266. Two consultation rounds with local communities and communes were carried out in September and October 2017 to: Inform affected households and communities of project potential impacts, Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 94 Collect information and initial feedback of local people, including representative of ethnic groups in potential project area. Confirm the broad community support by potentially affected ethnic groups for proj ect implementation. Confirmation of ethnic groups were made on the basis of presentation of project's potential impact, project purpose, its activities, and implementation plan. 15.3 Public Consultation Results 15.3.1 Environmental Consultation Process a nd Results 267. According to the OP4.01, the environmental assessment process should be available to the public . As such, MAF will consult with all of the involved /relevant stakeholders on project safeguard documents (ESMF) once during the process , prior to appraisal mission. The Public Consultation with all significant stakeholders on the project draft safeguard instruments ( i.e. the ESMF and SA) will take place in Vientiane capital during November 2017. Invitations were already issue d and document s were circulated and posted on the MAF website in both English and Lao language , prior to the expected meeting date. 268. The LACP consultations aimed at: (i) providing background information to various stakeholders on the LACP, (ii) receiving feedback from co ncerned stakeholders , both targeted communities/enterprises and concerned government agencies , as well as civil society and NGOs to take into an account gender aspect s on issues and proposed mitigation measures and institution al arrangement s pertaining to the ESMF of LACP ; and (iii) discuss ing ways to maximize LACP environmental and social performance. 269. During project preparation, the communit ies and provincial authorities provide d the following feedback s on the project objective , components and their associated potential impact s as follows : Possibility for project to finance rehabilitation of the existing gravity fed irrigation canals from large dam/reservoirs Farmers expressed the need for good seed and good agricultural practices and regular support from the provincial agricultural extension officers Famers indicated that they would be interested in using matching grants for the purchasing of threshers and harvesters; Overall, communities acknowledged the list of adverse impacts mentioned by the safe guards specialists, but did not feel that they were a problem for continuing the project (e.g. it was explained that the need for more water through irrigation outweighed the temporary interruptions in service they would encounter); all agreed that the adv erse impacts seemed reasonable and temporary; Water User Group (WUG) leaders requested that their respective WUGs be provided reasonable notice (as soon as possible) with respect to when the canals would be under construction in order to inform their WUG m embers accordingly. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 95 15.3.2 Social Consultation Results 270. On the basis of potential project impact, the community consults provide the following feedback. Potential Project Impact: Participants agreed that the project would have positive impacts, and concurred with the positive social and environmental impacts described. Land acquisition. Main canal in this area passes through community land, and secondary/tertiary canals impact in dividual household lands. Participants think the benefits from the irrigation scheme improvements outweigh land acquisition impact. Participants said they are happy to donate their affected land. Upon listening to the compensation principles of the project , participants confirmed they understand and agree with this. They support the project. Grievances Redress Mechanism (GRM). Ethnic peoples typically lodge any complaints to the village organization. Some prefer going to the head of the ethnic group before going to the villages. Participation. Ethnic peoples should be encouraged to participate in project activities by designing activities that are appropriate to them in terms of culture, farming practices. Gender. Women are involved with crop production (gr owing, transplanting, harvesting) and livestock. Men work more with pest management and fertilizer application which are generally heavy work. Men typically coordinate water with other members in the water user group to ensure sufficient water for their cr op. Community Support . Given the potential social and environmental positive impacts, and that the project benefits outweigh the limited adverse impact, the participants, both ethnic minorities and Lao majority, indicated their support for project impleme ntation. 15.4 Disclosure 271. Information disclosure: A ccording to the World Bank's policy on access to information, all draft safeguard instruments under this project, including the SA, CRPF, EGEG, and ESMF must be disclosed locally in an accessible place and in a form and language understandable to key stake holders and in Lao language and English on the Bank's website before the project appraisal mission.

It aims to provide basic knowledge to the national, provincial and district government, the LACP team, consultants, Kumban (KB) staff, village officials, private and public sector agencies with adequate guidance for eff ectively addressing the safeguard issues in line with OP 4.09. The process will be implemented as part of the LACP project cycle and fully integrated into the subproject selection, approval, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation process. The LACP does not include procurement of pesticides, but the ESMF identifies key issues related to the existing use of pesticide and chemical fertilizers and identified mitigation measures required in relation to prohibit ed items, training, and guidelines on safe use and disposal of pesticides. The PMP will be applicable for all LACP activities related mostly to: Component A: Improved Agriculture Efficiency and Sustainability, which supports (a) Adopting good varieties and quality seeds, (b) Promoting good agricult ure practices, (c) Providing critical infrastructure, and (d) Strengthening public services delivery . In instances where activities under Component B would potentially impact pesticide use and reduction, the PMP will also apply for: Component B: Enhanced Agriculture Commercialization, which supports: (a) Establishing Agriculture Value Chain Facility (AVCF), (b) Linking farmers to markets, and (c) Improving the enabling environment . Village visits indicted that chemical based fertilizers and pesticides a re currently being used in the project areas, particularly in instances where monoculture is practiced. Responsible agency: The LACP staff at central and local levels will be responsible for implementation of the PMP and ensuring full compliance, incl uding keeping proper documentation in the project file for possible review by the World Bank. This document is considered a living document and could be modified and changed as it is appropriated. Close consultation with the World Bank and clearance of the revised PMP will be necessary. SECTION I. POLICY AND REGULATIONS World Bank's safeguard policy on pest management (OP 4.09) OP 4.09 (pest management). The policy requires projects involving procurement of pesticide to prepare and implement a Pest Management Plan to ensure that the handling, transportation, usage, disposal of pesticide be safe for both human and the environment. The LACP will not promote the procurement of any chemical pesticides or herbicides. However, if pest invasion occu rs, small amount of eligible and registered pesticides in the project provinces is allowed if supplemented by additional training of farmers to ensure pesticide safe uses in line with World bank's policies (OP 4.09). And, given that t he project is designe d to promote the reduction in chemical pesticide and fertilizer use in existing farm land by enhancing sustainable farming practices, this simplified Pest Management Plan was prepared, along with a negative list. While the project will not procure and prom ote use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, which are included in the non -eligibility list, it may be unrealistic to completely prevent all farmers from applying chemical inputs. Specifically, rehabilitation of irrigation, building of small irrigation/ agriculture production, and/or control of infestation of diseases may involve the use of pesticides, herbicides, and insecticides. To mitigate this potential impact, this simplified PMP has been prepared outlining clear regulations and procedures for mana gement of pesticides and/or toxic chemical as well as providing knowledge and training on health impacts and safe use of pesticides and/or, when possible, promotion of non -chemical use alternatives such as organic farming. The simplified PMP is informed by the Regulation on the Control of Pesticides in Lao PDR (2014) as well as guidelines on Integrated Pest Management (IPM) provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The LACP will work closely with agriculture sector to a pply the Conservation Agricultural Technology approved by Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) in 2006 for the agricultural activities. This PMP is adopted and simplified from the PMP prepared for PRF III project. Government regulation related to pest management Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 120 In March 2000, with support from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the MAF established the Regulation number 0886/MAF and recently updated it on June 11, 2010 into Regulation 2860/MAF (Annex 2) on Pest Management in Lao PDR. The regulation was developed based on the WHO recommended Classification of Pesticide by Hazard and Guideline to Classification 1994 -1995. The GoL had registered in January 2010 the companies who import pesticides, fertilizers and seeds into Lao PDR. The list of registered pesticides has been adjusted in May 2010 based on the updated regulation. The Department of Agriculture (DoA) under MAF is mandated to oversee all pesticide use. SECTION II. KEY ISSUES AND MITIGATION MEASURES Key issues related to use of pesticide and chemical fertilizer The PMP is developed to support project community and a responsibility of all parties to support the implementation and proper applicability o f the WB OP 4.09. Negative impacts from the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers are expected to be minor and localized and could be mitigated during the planning and implementation of the project. Given that uses of pesticides and inorganic fertili zers are normal practices of some farmers, the LACP will promote IPM to avoid inappropriate use of them. However, it is important for MAF staff and local communities to understand the nature of such activities to encourage farmers to reduce the uses of pes ticides and inorganic fertilizers. Below summarize the possible activities which could be associated with the uses of pesticides and inorganic fertilizers under LACP. Implementation of subprojects related to increasing agriculture productivity (rice, co rn and vegetables production) for commercialization as well as improving irrigation systems may lead to increase of pesticide, chemical, and fertilizer uses. Utilization of insecticide at rice mills. From the experience dealing with farmers and rice mil lers in 5 provinces, they do not use pesticides but inorganic fertilizers in their farming. No fumigation activities at rice mill. Actions for mitigation The negative impacts from the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers from LACP activities would be minor and localized and could be mitigated during the planning and implementation of the project. During the consultation stage with villages, there are opportunities to enhance positive impact during the planning and selection of the subprojects. Bel ow summarize the activities to be carried out during the planning and implementation of LACP on pest management. (a) Prohibition To avoid adverse impacts due to pesticides, procurement of pesticides will not be promoted and this has been included in the \"non -eligibility list\". (b) MAF staff training The LACP will continue providing basic knowledge on alternative options for agriculture development and /or livelihood activities, including safe use of pesticides and other toxic chemicals. Budget would be allocated for project staff training to understand 1) overall policy on Pest Management (government and Bank policy); 2) basic knowledge on possibly negative impact on environmental and health from the use of pesticide and chemical fertilizer; and 3) b asic knowledge on how to prevent it including what are the prohibited items in the country for pesticide and chemical fertilizer, how to prevent or mitigate the negative impact from the use etc. (staff training could be done jointly with other topics). Th is training would be provided for subprojects that involve the use of fertilizer, pesticides, and/or toxic chemicals. (c) Provide knowledge to farmers Prior consultation would be provided to project KBs. Pest management will be included as one topic for vi llage consultation meeting at the KB. If likely that the agriculture support would be priority for a particular village either agriculture Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 121 infrastructure and livelihood support, training on pest management should be provided in the following areas: Pest m anagement training: The objective is to provide basic knowledge to the target farmer on prohibited pesticides, the negative impacts of the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers both on environmental and human health, and how to mitigate their negative impacts if there is a need for using them. It is also to inform farmers that, the GoL is not intended to support the use of any pesticides and chemical fertilizers in any agricultural productivity but promote conservation agriculture instead. However, the country has experienced severe pest invasions, and could lead to the usage of pesticides and chemical fertilizers in some cases to limit losses and damages to the agriculture products. The procurement of pesticide and chemical fertilizer will not be funde d under LACP budget except for the special circumstances of the insect invasion occurred and the proper training has been provided to farmers. Training on GoL regulations: The country is experienced in the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers and l earnt from its neighboring countries. The LACP will train target farmers on Regulation number 2860/MAF on Pesticide Management before any subprojects are implemented, subject to compliance with the Bank's safeguard policy OP 4.09 on Pest Management. Tech nical training: This training would aim at providing the target farmers to understand clearly the technical aspects of pesticides and skills in using them such as what are the eligible and prohibited items of pesticides in Lao, the level of negative impact s of each eligible item, how to use them, how to protect and minimize the negative impacts while using them, how to keep them before and after used etc. Thus, the trainers would be someone from PAFO or DAFO who is knowledgeable on this. LACP will finance t he training cost and per diem and transportation cost for the trainers. Procurement, storage, and usage of pesticide: the LACP will not involve procurement of pesticides. That said, any pesticides currently used in the project areas would require proper storage and usage monitoring throughout the course of the LACP, and this r esponsibility will lie fully with the DOA. The DOA should strictly follow with articles 18 and 19 of the MAF's regulation number 2860/MAF for procuring the pesticide; articles 20, 21 and 22 for transportation, storage and trans -boundary transportation of p esticides; and articles 23 and 24 for the safety use of pesticide. The DOA or user may refer in addition to the article 25 and 26 for the storage and usage of pesticide. Continued monitoring of pesticide use: As part of the regular monitoring of project activity, the World Bank and LACP teams will continue to monitor changes in pesticides, insecticides and chemical fertilizers use in all project related activities. Programs and trainings will be specifically amended to address any such changes. Promoti on of non -chemical agriculture The LACP has been designed also to promote good agricultural practices and conservation of natural resources when possible. It is anticipated that linking the LACP agriculture activities with conservation agriculture techniq ues will be important for improving quality of life among farmers. Subprojects for LACP are still being determined, but for instances where subprojects are located in remote areas, the sustainable use of natural resources would be critical for farmers' livelihoods development and poverty reduction. If protected areas or critical natural habitats are located nearby, it is necessary to also take measures to minimize potential negative impacts and/or enhance positive impacts through community -driven processes . In this context, a \"conservation agriculture technique\" should be introduced for target communities, if and when applicable. During the planning process, actions will be carried out jointly between the LACP and DAFO to plan and train farmers. Impleme ntation arrangement and budget (a) Planning and implementation In close cooperation with PAFO, LACP staff at central level will be responsible for providing training to LACP staff at province and local level and Kumban facilitator during the consultation and planning stage. Budget for training will be included in the subproject cost or capacity building as appropriate.

In cases of removable antiquities or sensitive remains, a night g uard shall be arranged until the responsible local authorities or the National Culture Administration take over; - Notify the supervisory Project Environmental Officer and Project Engineer who in turn will notify the responsible local authorities and the Cul ture Department of Province immediately (within 24 hours or less); - Responsible local authorities and the Culture Department of Province would be in charge of protecting and preserving the site before deciding on subsequent appropriate procedures. This woul d require a preliminary evaluation of the findings to be performed by the archeologists of National Culture Administration. The significance and importance of the findings should be assessed according to the various criteria relevant to cultural heritage; those include the aesthetic, historic, scientific or research, social and economic values; - Decisions on how to handle the finding shall be taken by the responsible authorities and Culture Department of Province. This could include changes in the layout (s uch as when finding an irremovable remain of cultural or archeological importance) conservation, preservation, restoration and salvage; - Implementation for the authority decision concerning the management of the finding shall be communicated in writing by r elevant local authorities; and - Construction work could resume only after permission is given from the responsible local authorities or Culture Department of Province concerning safeguard of the heritage. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 124 ANNEX 5: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SCREENING FORM The Environmental and Social screening form to identify project impact, check lists to monitor impact of the sub -project implementation are provided as follows: Environmental Screening Form Step 1: Project Screening Checklists The non -eligible list in Annex 1 of this ESMF will be used to screen the sub -project activities. Table 19 of Chapter 9 of this ESMF and Table 1 of this Annex will be use d to screen the sub -project risk and its sensitivity. Table 1 also use for screening if the POE for dam inspection will be required. Step 2: Guidance for Sub -Project Categorization Categorization: To ensure that the extent of the review is commensurate with the nature of risk, categorization is a useful step in procedures where based on basic information about a project such as sector and scale, the level of E&S risk the project could pose is determined. This also enables the PMU to determine the extent and sophistication of the E&S review. Examples of ca tegorization are High, Medium, and Low risk or Category A, B, C. Category A Sub -project The sub -project proposal and its operative setting must be explained to be able to determine the appropriate environmental category. The following characteristics of possible impacts of the transaction typically trigger Category A designation. The location of the farmers/project enterprise or activity may be: Near sensitive and valuable ecosystems, protected areas and habitat of endangered species; Near sensitive receptor such as hospital, school, temple, etc.; Near areas with archaeological and/or historic sites or existing cultural and social institutions; Near or in areas occupied by vulnerable ethnic minorities or indigenous peoples, or lands to which they are collectively attached; In densely populated areas, where resettlement may be required or potential pollution impacts and other disturbances may sig nificantly affect communities; In regions where there are conflicts in natural resources allocation; Near watercourses, aquifer recharge areas or in reservoirs used for potable water supply; or in or close to lands or waters containing valuable resources . Examples of sensitivity issues are those where the sub -project can: Cause adverse global or regional environmental impacts; Concern the rights of indigenous people or vulnerable ethnic minorities; Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 125 Require large scale land acquisition or subsequent change in land use that produces loss or damage of assets or income for local residents; Lead to involuntary settlements or displacement of people from their livelihoods; Impact protected or otherwise recognized areas of high biodiversity or cultural val ue; or Lead to toxic waste disposal. Acquisition of small parcels of land, even if obtained on a negotiated basis with property owners or those with recognized rights to the land, should be considered as sensitive if expropriation or other compulsory mea sures would have resulted upon the failure of negotiation Examples where the nature of the sub -project may: Cause irreversible degradation or unsustainable exploitation of natural resources; or Pose serious risks of significant harm to human health an d safety. Examples of the magnitude of the sub -project where: A high amount of scarce resources may be put at risk; The timing and duration of the negative impacts are long; or The cumulative effects of many similar, but individually small transactions together lead to serious impacts. Category A sub -project are perceived to have significant adverse environmental and/or social impacts, and are not permitted to form part of the target portfolio. Category B Sub -project Transactions with a limited number of potentially adverse environmental or social impacts that are generally site -specific, largely reversible, and readily addressed through mitigation measures that reduce the r isk to moderate or low levels are normally classified as Category B. The following characteristics indicate a Category B transaction. Environmental and social risks for the most part are mostly limited to and readily mitigated through application of good industry practice as described in relevant Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines; Labor and working conditions are unlikely to include harmful child labor, involuntary or compulsory labor, or significant occupational health and safety issues; Significant land acquisition or significant land use change is not expected, nor is there expectation of displacement of people or significant loss of livelihoods due to project activities; and Socially or economically disadvantaged groups, such as tribal or ethnic groups or similar communities, are not known to occur in the project's area of direct impact, nor does the activity involve use of lands to which they are collectively attached. In the agribusiness sector, the issue of supply chains for raw materi als can be complex and, in some instances, this issue poses a significant reputational risk. In screening a sub -project, the PMU in close consultation with PAFO/DAFO will consider the matter of supply chains, especially under the Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 126 following three circumstan ces: (a) the source of the raw materials is clearly defined and dedicated; (b) there is recognized risk with respect to harmful child labor, involuntary or compulsory labor, or significant occupational health and safety issues associated with the supply ch ain; or (c) the source of raw materials are lands occupied by or traditional lands of indigenous peoples as defined in the World Bank Safeguard Policy on Indigenous Peoples. 3.3 Category C Sub -project: Sub -project proposal that are perceived to have mini mal or no adverse environmental or social impacts are classified as Category C, and no further environmental or social assessment work needs to be done after initial screening and categorization.

Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 146 ANNEX 7 : TERMS OF REFERENCE - PANEL OF EXPERTS Project background 1. The proposed Laos Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) seeks to enhance the competitiveness and sustainability of Lao PDR's agriculture sector through technical and financial support to increase in agricultural productivity and commercialization in selected strategic value chains. The project would focus on: (i) geographical areas with high agricultural development potentials; (ii) farming systems with h igh potential for commercialization (i.e. paddy, maize, vegetables); (iii) promotion of good agricultural practices and climate smart agricultural technologies and farming system diversification to enhance food and nutritional security; (iv) building capac ity for farmers' organizations, agribusinesses, public and private service providers; and (v) building on and developing synergies with other government/donor programs. 2. Lending Instrument: The proposed Project would have a total cost of USD 29.3 million an d would be supported by the World Bank through an Investment Project Financing (IPF) in the form of an IDA Credit for USD 25.0 million equivalent. 3. Project Costs and Financing: The table below presents the total costs and indicated IDA financing for the p roject. In addition to the proposed IDA credit, the government would provide an estimated USD 0.5 million in counterpart financing for the project, while farmers, farmer groups and agribusiness entities would provide an estimated USD 5.6 million associated with their matching grants. 4. The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase commercialization of selected value chains in the project areas. The LACP is comprised of the following three components: (1) Improved Agriculture Efficiency and Sustainab ility; (2) Enhanced Agriculture Commercialization; and (3) Project Management. 5. Component A: Improved Agriculture Efficiency and Sustainability (est. US$ 18.7 million, of which International Development Association (IDA) would finance around US$ 16.7 milli on). This component would support: (a) Adopting good varieties and quality seeds, (b) Promoting good agriculture practices, (c) Providing critical infrastructure, and (d) Strengthening public services delivery. 6. Under component (A3): Providing Critical In frastructure (est. US$ 6.1 million, of which IDA would finance around US$ 5.6 million). The main objective of this subcomponent is to improve critical public infrastructure to support farmers in development of commercial agriculture. The project will finan ce new construction of missing infrastructure and rehabilitation of existing ones (mainly irrigation schemes) to improve their operations and efficiency. The project will also support PAFOs and Department of Irrigation (DOI) of MAF to provide training in n ew irrigation models aiming at reducing operating costs and improving water productivity through establishment and strengthening of water user groups to effectively operate and maintain existing and the newly built infrastructure supported by the project. Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 147 7. Under this component, the project intends to rehabilitate 71 existing irrigation schemes. Among those schemes, 5 systems feature earthen dam and reservoirs. The dimensions of the dams vary from site to site, and in particular the dam crest height is comp rised between 13 m and 28 m. The nominal storage capacity of the reservoirs is comprised between 2.2 and 28 million cubic meters. Below is the list and main characteristics of the 5 irrigation reservoirs: Table: Indicative list of reservoir irrigation sys tems Province District Reservoir Name Dam Height Dam crest length Storage capacity (million cu.m) 1.

Bolikhamxay Borikhan Nam Kap 13 m. 220 m. 4.34 Rationale 8. The dam and reservoir dimensions indicate that all 5 reservoir s headwork classify as Large Dams as per the World Bank Operational Manual OP 4.37 for Safety of Dams. The project interventions do not intend to do any repair or change on the irrigation reservoir headwork themselves. However, the reservoirs are expected t o be used as the main source of irrigation water supply to the target command cropping areas. The proposed interventions focus on increasing water management efficiency in the distribution network. The rehabilitation works will consist in upgrading existin g earthen canals to concrete lined canals or U -shape brick masonry canals. It is expected that the repairs in those 5 irrigation systems will not occur before the third year of project implementation to provide time to comply with Dam safety requirements a nd due diligence. 9.

Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 150 ANNEX 8 DAM SAFETY RELATED PROCEDURES Overall 1. As per OP 4.37 Dam Safety policy - Large dam is distinguished from the small dam with the following criteria: (i) Small dams are normally less than 15 meters in height. This category includes, for example, farm ponds, local silt retention dams, and low embankment tanks; (ii) Large dams are 15 meters or more in height. Dams that are between 10 and 15 meters in height are treated as large dams if they present special design complexities --for example, an unusually large flood -handling requirement, location in a zone of high seismicity, foundations that are complex and difficult to prepare, or retention of toxic materials. Dams under 10 meters in height are treated as large dams if they are expected to become large dams during the operation of the facility or if one of the following three conditions are met: a) reservoir capacity greater than 3 million m3; b) crest length g reater than 500 m; or iii) spillway capacity greater than 2,000 m3/s. 2. Large dam will be handled under OP 4.37 (Dam safety), while small dams will be handled under OP 4.01 . For small dams, generic dam safety measures designed by qualified engineers are usually adequate. For large dams, the Bank requires reviews by independent panel of experts. 3. As the sub -project activities, do not include a new dam but will rely on the performance of an existing dam, irrigation canal that may directly draw water from a reservoir controlled by the existing dam, irrigation system that will depend on the storage and operation of an existing dam for their supply of water and could not function if the dam failed. The Bank requires that the borrower arrange for one or more independent dam specialists to (a) inspect and evaluate the safety status of the existing dam, its appurtenances, and its perfo rmance history; (b) review and evaluate the owner's operation and maintenance procedures; and (c) provide a written report of findings and recommendations for any remedial work or safety -related measures necessary to upgrade the existing dam to an acceptab le standard of safety. MAF has prepared TOR of PoE in Annex 7. The result of the dam inspection and findings and recommendations for remedial work or safety -related measures necessary to upgrade the existing dam to an acceptable standard of safety will be reviewed by the Bank. The dam inspection need to be reviewed during implementation phase and prior to the implementation of the sub -projects downstream of large dams. This is to ensure that the failure of the existing dam will not cause extensive damage to or failure of the Bank -funded activities . 4. The detailed investigation , design studies and supervision will be undertaken by a competent consulting firm if remedial measures are required to address dam safety risks. The TOR to hire the consultin g firm will be reviewed by the B ank. The Construction supervision and Quality Assurance (CSQA) Plan, an Instrumentation Plan, an O&M Plan and an Emergency Preparedness Plan (EPP) need to be prepared and implemented by the detailed design consulting firm. MAF will take responsible to ensure that the results of the detailed investigation and design, CSQA plan, Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) Lao Agriculture Commercialization Project (LACP) 151 Instrumentation Plan, O&M Plan and Emergency Preparedness Plan (EPP)will be reviewed by an international dam specialist and the Bank. 5. Construction Supervision and Quality assurance (CSQA) Plan -The CSQA Plan covers the organization, staffing levels, procedures, equipment and qualifications for supervision of the construction of remedial works on existing dams and ensures that the dam safety related elements of the design are sufficiently addressed during construction. The Plan for each of large dams will be prepared by the detailed design consultant during project implementation and will be submitted to the Bank for review before the detailed design is completed. 6. Instrumentation Plan - The Instrumentation Plan indicates the required monitoring instruments, including existing ones and newly procured ones, to monitor and record dam behavior and related hydro meteorological , structural, and seismic factors. The Plan also covers the types, numbers, layout, and specifications of instruments as well as reading frequency and thresholds for triggering warning for each type of equipment. The Plan for each of large dams will be prepared by the detailed desi gn consultant during project implementation and will be submitted to the Bank and one or two independent dam specialists for review before the detailed design is completed. 7. Operation & Maintenance (O&M) Plan - The O&M Plan covers the organizational structu re, staffing, technical expertise, and training required; equipment and facilities needed to operate and maintain the dam: O&M procedures, and arrangements for funding O&M activities, including regular surveillance, monitoring, long -term maintenance and sa fety inspections. The O&M Plan for each of large dams will be prepared by the detailed design consultant during project implementation and will be submitted to the Bank and an international dam specialist for review before the detailed design is completed. 8. Emergency Preparedness Plan (EPP) - The EPP specifies the roles and responsibilities of relevant parties when dam failure is considered imminent, or when expected operational flow release threatens downstream life, property, or economic conditions that depend on river flow levels. It include s the following items: clear statements on the responsibilities for dam operations decision making and for the related emergency communications; maps outlining inundation levels for various emergency conditions; flood warning system characteristics; and procedures for evacuating threatened areas and mobilizing emergency forces and equipment. Inundation and flood hazard maps should indicate the dam break wave arrival time and duration of inundation, based on dam break m odelling and simulation of dam break wave propagation in the downstream areas. Flood damage estimates and potential loss of life should be developed based on the above results. The EPP for each of large dams will be prepared by the detailed design consulta nt during project implementation and will be submitted to the Bank and an international dam specialist for review before the detailed design consultancy is completed.
