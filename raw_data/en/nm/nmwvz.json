E.;Yang , gqin;O-Uchi,Jin;Jhun, Bong Sook Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Rhode Island Hospital and Alpert Medical School of Brown University Introduction: Abnormal mitochondrial morphology concomitant with mitochondrial dysfunction are frequently observed in human heart failure ( HF). However, it is still unclear what kinds of cardiac signaling pathways regulate mitochondrial morphology and induces mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction in cardiomyocyte s, which contributes to cardiac dysfunction in vivo Methods: Neonatal rat microscopy. Translocation and activation of PKD were detected by Western blot analysis and live cell imaging. Results: We found that 1-AR stimulation induced mitochondrial fragmentation in NCMs. This effect was abolished by the expression of the dominant -negative mutants of PKD and Dynamin -Like Protein and DLP1 are required for mitochondrial fragmentation under 1-AR stimulation. We also found th at PKD was translocated from thecytosol to themitochondria under 1-AR stimulation. In addition, PKD activation led to phospho of generation, mitochondrial transition pore opening, a small -molecule PKD -specific inhibitor, CRT0066101 effects. phosphorylation at S637 occurs in vivo using ventricular tissues from transgenic mice with cardiac -specific overexpression of constitutively active G q protein. Conclusion: GqPCR mitochondrial Inhibition of G qPCR -PKD-DLP1 signaling represents a potential novel therapeutic target to limit or prevent mitochondrial fragmentatio n, mitochondrial injury, and myocardial death during HF.ABSTRACT #3 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Brown University Mouse Transgenic and Gene Targeting Facility Authors Ahn, Youngwook; Lindhardt, Kaitlin Department MCB Division Biology and Medicine Hospital PI Ahn, Youngwook Trainee Yes NoX Level Choose an item.New Investigator Yes NoX Highest Degree Funding Citation for Publication ; Please make a list of authors, one name per line Last name, Initials Ahn, Y.

In doing so it will aid in improving orthotic and wrist implant designs, and provide a benchmark for the evaluation of treatments. Characterizing the wrist's six degree -of-freedom (DOF) flexibility requires a sophisticated six DOF testing strategy. OBJECTIVE Accordingly, the objective of this study was t o develop a protocol for determining the complete mechanical properties of the wrist using a six degree -of-freedom (DOF) robot musculoskeletal simulator. METHODS A six axis industrial robot (KUKA KR 6 R700, Augsburg, DE) was integrated with simVITRO labvi ew- based control software (Cleveland Clinic, Ohio , US) for controlling and reporting joint kinetics and kinematics .A single forearm/hand spe cimen was mounted to the robot; the spatial relationships between the robot, load cell and the specimen were establ ished using a 6 -DOF digitizing probe (Optotrak, NDI, CA). Radius -and 3rdmetacarpal -based coordinate systems were generated via the digitization of anatomic landmarks . The wrist was tested using pure and combined wrist rotations produced using defined rot ational trajectories in each of the four anatomic directions, as well twenty coupled directions (e.g. radial flexion or radial extension). The ROM and stiffness envelopes were constructed by compiling the respective values for each testing trajectory and plotting them on polar plots. RESULTS The principal direction of the wrist ROM envelope was oriented obliquely to the anatomical directions, from radial extension to ulnar flexion. The largest wrist range of motion was 91.2\u00b0 in the direction of ulnar flex ion, 15\u00b0 oblique from pure flexion. The principal axis of the stiffness envelope was oriented orthogonal to the principal axis of the ROM envelope. The smallest stiffness value was in the ulnar flexion direction and the largest stiffness value in the radia l flexion direction. CONCLUSION Musculoskeletal simulation using robotic testing provides an innovative and powerful technique to understand wrist biomechanics because of its multi -dimensional characteristics.Figure 1 -Wrist ROM en velope (Degrees) Figure 2 -Wrist stiffness envelope (Nm/Degree) ABSTRACT #12 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title The Role of Cardiac Fibroblast Senescence in Arrhythmogenesis of the Aged Research CenterDivision Division of Cardiology Hospital Cardiovascular Institute PI Gideon Koren Trainee Yes No Level PhD StudentNew Investigator Yes No Highest Degree Bachelor Funding NIH Citation for Publication ; Please make a list of authors, one name per line Last name, Initials Baggett, B.

Koren, G.Title of Abstract The Role of Cardiac Fibroblast Senescence in Arrhythmogenesis of the Aged Infarcted Heart Institutional affiliations Cardiovascular Research Center, Division of Cardiology, Cardiovascular Institute, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, RI, Koren, Aging is associated with a more than ten -fold increase in the incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD), contributing to 20% of all deaths. Myocardia l infarction (MI) promotes the development of pathological cardiac arrhythmias that increase the risk of SCD, although the related mechanisms are not well understood. After MI, cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) differentiate into cardiac myofibroblasts (CMFs) that secrete pro -fibrotic compounds which preserve cardiac architecture during wound healing. Cellular senescence is critical to normal wound healing by both limiting excessive fibrosis and recruiting immune cells to clear necrotic myocardium, however aging is associated with a detrimental persistence of senescent cells. Our hypothesis is that the age -related senescence of CMFs is one causal factor to the increased infarct border zone fibrosis observed in the aged infarcted heart. Previously, our lab has charac terized and established the aged rabbit as a model for the aging heart. We can reproducibly induce a myocardial infarction via a minimally invasive procedure involving implantation of an embolic coil into the left coronary artery. Using Masson's staining to quantify cellular senescence, we show that in aged rabbits there is an increase in senescent CMFs in the infarct zone compared to young rabbits, and an increa se in interstitial fibrosis in the aged infarct border zone. Using a three -week time course, we also observed a delayed and persistent response of CMF senescence in the aged infarct zone. My research will address the role senescence plays in arrhythmogenes is of the aged infarcted heart and the mechanism by which arrhythmias arise in aged infarcted hearts using a mouse model. My preliminary studies involve investigation of reproducibility of the induction of MI in mice via ligation of the left coronary arter y, and measuring the effects of senescence and fibrosis in Cre -Lox mouse lines designed to enhance or ablate CMF senescence specifically in the heart.ABSTRACT #65 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Parent Emotion Regulation Moderates the Association between Adolescent Emotion Regulation and Communication about Relationships Authors Bala, Kelsey; Shuster, Coral; Hood, Erik; Houck, Christopher; Rizzo, Christie Department Psychiatry Division Forensic and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Hospital Rhode Island Hospital PI Houck, Christopher Trainee Yes Nox Level Choose an item.New Investigator Yes Nox Highest Degree PhD or equiv Funding National Institute of Justice Citation for Publication ; Please make a list of authors, one name per line Last name, Initials Bala, K., Shuster, C., Hood, E., Houck, C., & Rizzo, C.Title of Abstract Parent Emotion Regulation Moderates the Association between Adolescent Emotion Regulation and Communication about Relationships Institutional affiliations Northeastern UniversityComparison of Parent and Adolescent Endorsement of Emotion Re gulation BehaviorsParent Emotion Regulation Moderates the Association between Adolescent Emotion Regulation and Communication about Relationships Bala, Kelsey, Shuster, Coral, Hood, Erik, Houck, Christopher, & Rizzo, Christie Department of Psychiatry, Division of Forensic and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Rhode Island Hospital & Northeastern University Relationship risks such as dating violence and unprotected sex can have significant negative consequences for youth. Research suggests that open parent -child communication, including conversations about sex, reduce the l ikelihood of relationship risks (Magdol et al., 1998; Miller et al. 2007). Many parents do not discuss these challenging topics with their adolescents, especially their sons, and that difficulty is exacerbated if parents perceive their child as unable to c omprehend the information (Wilson & Coo, 2010). One barrier to perceived comprehension may be the child's inability to regulate emotions during difficult conversations. Adolescents who report having difficulty regulating also report discussing fewer sexual health topics with parents (Shuster & Houck, 2016). Research has not investigated the potential influence of parents' emotion regulation (ER) on communication with their sons. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between ER strateg ies used by both parents and adolescents, and the number of romantic relationship topics discussed. Baseline data was collected from 7thand 8thgrade males (n=94) and their parents (n=94) in a clinical trial examining a dyadic, web -based dating violence a nd sexual risk prevention program (Project STRONG). Parents and adolescents reported their use of ER strategies (Emotion Regulation Behaviors Scale) and parents indicated the relationship risk topics discussed (Miller et al., 1998). Surveys were completed using laptops for privacy. Findings revealed variability in ER strategies reported by parents and sons (see Table 1). Adolescent ER was significantly correlated with the number of relationship topics discussed ( r=0.247,p<.05). A multiple linear regression examined the moderating role of parent ER, with parents' skills moderating this relationship (r2=0.039,p<.05); when parents endorsed more ER strategies, their son's ER strategies were strongly associated with the number of relationship topics discu ssed. When parents endorsed fewer ER strategies, the association was not significant. Findings suggest that conversations between parents and adolescent sons about sensitive topics surrounding dating and sexual health are a function of the ER skills posse ssed by both parent and child. However, parent emotion regulation may be more influential in determining whether these conversations occur, regardless of how well their son self -regulates.ABSTRACT #27 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Visualizing and Classifying Bacterial Biofilms on Orthopedic Materials Authors Barber, Douglas; Garcia Jr., Geronimo Department Orthopaedic Surgery Division Rhode Island Hospital Hospital RIH PI Dioscaris Garcia Trainee Yesx No Level Choose an item.New Investigator Yesx No Highest Degree Bachelor Funding Foundation Citation for Publication ; Please make a list of authors, one name per line Last name, Initials Barber, D Garcia, G Garcia, D Born, CVisualizing and Classifying Bacterial Biofilms on Orthopedic Materials Institutional affiliations Brown UniversityClick here to enter text.Barber, Douglas; Garcia Jr., Geronimo, Garcia, Dioscaris Garcia, Born, Christopher. Diane N. Weiss Center for Orthopedic Trauma Research, Rhode Island Hospital, Brown University. Background Open fractures pose significant therapeutic challenges for Orthopedic Trauma surgeons. Infection rates as high as 30% lead to high morbidity and mortality among affected patients. Bacteria that have adhered to orthopedic devices produce a matrix of protein s, exopolysaccharides, and extracellular DNA that encapsulate the microbes. Once mature, these biofilms are virtually impossible to eradicate due to horizontal gene transfer, low -metabolism persister cells, and low permeability of the extracellular matrix. Goal/Objective Because antibiotics are largely ineffective for treating biofilms, the field of Orthopedic Trauma would benefit from novel methods of biofilm prevention and removal. This project aims to create an In vitro model of biofilm development and visualization on orthopedic materials using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Methods By fluorescently staining different matrix components, the structure and composition of the biofilm can be identified at each stage of development. We specifically use scanning electron microsc opy as well as confocal laser scanning microscopy to obtain our results . Results Are attached as picture. Conclusion This model will serve to advance our understanding of how biofilms develop on orthopedic materials, and to test n ovel prevention and removal methodologies.ABSTRACT #23 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Differential Expression of the Check -point protein, VISTA, both in Response In vitro Stimuli and In vivo Septic Insult Authors Biron Girard, Bethany; Tolbert, Jessica; Chung, Chun -Shiang; Ayala, Alfred Department Surgery Division Surgical Research Hospital Rhode Island Hospital PI Dr. Alfred Ayala Trainee YesX No Level PostdocNew Investigator Yes NoX Highest Degree PhD or equiv Funding NIH Citation for Publication ; Please make a list of authors, one name per line Biron Girard, B.

It is a life -threatening condition that affects many critically ill patients, however, there is no currently FDA -approved therapeutic treatmen t. Thus, a better understanding of the patho - biology of sepsis is needed if we are to identify novel therapies. VISTA is an immune checkpoint protein found on mature myeloid cells as well as T -cells that suppresses T cell mediated immune responses such a s proliferation and cytokine production. VISTA has been studied as an immunotherapy in cancer research. However, VISTA has not been studied in the context of sepsis. To better understand the role of VISTA in experimental sepsis we initially chose to c haracterized VISTA on cell types known to play a role in the immune response to septic infection; macrophages and T cells, under the hypothesis that VISTA plays a central role in macrophage and T cell function in response to experimental septic challenge i n mice. We first examined VISTA expression in culture/in vitro on J774 and Jurkat T cell lines using cell selective stimulation. VISTA expression was measured by both flow cytometry as well as western blot. After stimulation, Jurkat T cells displayed i ncreased VISTA expression; while J774 cells, showed decreased VISTA expression as compared to unstimulated cells. Additionally, we induced sepsis in adult C57BL/6 male mice via CLP. VISTA expression was measured in CD3+splenocytes as well as peritoneal m acrophages 24 hrs post -CLP via flow cytometry and Western blot assay. After 24 hours VISTA expression was increased in the spleen in CLP mice compared to sham, while in peritoneal macrophages VISTA expression was decreased following CLP compared to sham mi ce. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that unlike PD -1 and BTLA, where we documented rises in both lymphoid and macrophage expression in response to sepsis, VISTA expression is altered differentially in these two immune cell sub -populations. And while th e significance of these septic changes VISTA's expression remain to be defined in a causal/ pathogenic sense, it is tempting to speculate that such a unique expression pattern might explain the non -redundant functionality of VISTA as compared to these more classic check -point proteins.ABSTRACT #9 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Modeling cardiac output from IV -contrast attenuation profiles in computed tomography Authors Chang, ;Collin, Scott ;Baird, Grayson B .;Merck, Derek ; Atalay, Michael K Department Diagnostic Imaging Division Click here to enter text.

While cardiac output (CO) h ashigh diagnostic value in the emergency setting , current practices rely upon invasive procedures such as Swan -Ganz catheterization (SGC).Accordingly, there is longstanding need to develop non- invasive met hods to evaluate CO upon hospital admission. Objective: This retrospective study evaluates whether cardiac output can be reliably predicted from the pattern of contrast enhancement seen on computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Methods:We abstracted data from patients who underwent either SGC or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MR) within 14 days of a qualifying CTPA study obtained between 1/1/2006 to 12/30/2016. Using CO measurements from SGC or cardiac MR, patients were divided into two groups using a clinical threshold of CO <4 L/min. To determine the utility of CTPA studies in predicting CO, we measured the difference in Hounsfield unit (HU) attenuation between at the main pulmonary trunk (PT) and ascending aorta (aAO), and com pared the decay rate between the two groups. Results:We identified 119 patients with CO measurements and CTPA studies within the study period. On univariate analyses, patients with low CO (n=35, 29.4%) were more likely to have smaller body surface area ( 1.9\u00b10.3 vs 2.0\u00b10.3, p=0.014), and greater difference in (270.9\u00b1198.3 vs 100.1\u00b1114.2 HU, p<0.001). AUC analysis yieldeda threshold decay rate of 130 HU, with sensitivity and specificity of 74.3% and 87.7%. Adjusting for body surface area, there was 9.2-fold increase in odds of CO impairment whenthe decay rate exceeded 130 HU (95% CI 3.7 -22.9, p<0.001). Conclusions: Low CO states can be identified by CTPA studies when the PT/aAO intensitydifference exceeds 130 HU. Prospectiv e studies are needed to apply these methods to other CT angiogram studies employed in the emergency setting.ABSTRACT #52 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title NARCOTIC MEDICATIONS FOR INJURED CHILDREN: AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADRESS THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC Authors Cao, Shiliang Alice; Willis, Hale Department Pediatric Surgery Division Click here to enter text.

A recent review of narcotic prescribing practices at our level 1 pediatric trauma center (PTC) found extensive variation in prescribing practices among practitioners. Objective: We hypothesize that a lack of standardizati on in narcotic prescribing practices exists among PTCs nationally. Methods: A survey of discharge narcotic prescribing practices, electronic medical record (EMR) guidance, patient/parent narcotic education, and perceived barriers to education was created . The survey was sent to trauma medical directors of ACS and state -verified level I and II PTCs in the US. Results: Of 61 surveys sent to confirmed email addresses, 48 have been returned (79% response rate). Most narcotics are prescribed by residents (80%), followed by mid -level providers such as NPs (78%). EMR prescribing is common (82%); however, giv recommendations for narcotic prescribing. Regarding narcotic discharge education, 13% report a standardized format, 66% no standard format, 21% report \"unknown\". Most providing patient/parent narcotic education receive no training in non -pharmacological pain management (69%). Regarding most effective discharge education, 36% favored verbal instruction, 39% favored video educational. Most reported no formal process to reduce the quantity of narcotics prescribed at discharge (68%). Conclusions: In the cu rrent epidemic of narcotic misuse in the United States, excess narcotic prescribing and inappropriate utilization of narcotics by patients have been identified as potential root causes. Children are frequently first exposed to narcotics after injury, yet we found that even centers dedicated to treating childhood injury report a low utilization of practices to address these root causes of opioid misuse. While this study has an inherent selection bias by sampling large, primarily academic medical centers, t hese results suggest several potential areas to improvement discharge narcotic practices that are applicable for all centers treating injured children. Further work is needed to address these concerns.Barriers to Providing Discharge Narcotic E ducation Responses (%) Systems Barriers Staff training on how to provide narcotic education 74 Staff availability 57 Availability of educational resources 60 Communication Barriers Patient/ parent literacy 60 Patient/ parent language 57 Format of available education 46ABSTRACT #47 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Incidence and Outcomes of the Psychiatric Population among Acute Trauma Victims Authors Cao, Shiliang Alice; Heffernan, Daithi; Stephen, Andrew H.; Lueckel, Stephanie N.

Traumatic injuries, also common, remain leading causes of death. Medical comorbidities negatively impact health due to delayed presentation, altered physiologic responses and provider prejudice. However, there is lack of data regarding pre -existing psychia tric comorbidities in the trauma setting and their effect on trauma care delivery and outcomes Objective: We hypothesize that pre -trauma PI negatively impacts trauma care and outcomes. Methods: 10 -year review of patients aged 18years with PI versus wit hout PI, as defined by DSM. Patient characteristics, hospital care delivery and outcomes were compared. Data wasanalyzed using standard statistical tests. Results: Among 23,220 trauma admissions, PI patients(N=3386) were more likely younger(51.9 vs 53.3y rs;p=0.001), White (83% vs 80.6%;p<0.001), and uninsured (19.1% vs 16.9%;p<0.001). With respect to physiologic response, PI patients were more likely tachycardic(26.3% vs 20.3%;p<0.001). PI patients less likely had non -psychiatric medical comorbidies(23.5% vs 48.1%;p<0.001). However, among those with a comorbidity, PI patients had a greater average number of comorbidities(3.47vs 1.1;p<0.001). With respect to trauma -related delivery of care, no difference existed in time to first CT. However, in first 6 hours , PI patients went to the operating room faster (154.3 vs 184.6mins; p<0.001). There was no difference in ICU length of stay; however, PI patients had longer hospital stay (8.75 vs 6.87days; P=0.002). Secondary analysis excluding isolated substance abuse a nd dementia patients resulted in no difference in hospital length of stay. Adjusting for patient characteristics, presence of PI did not affect risk of death (OR=0.841(95%CI=0.700 -1.01)) or discharge to long -term rehabilitation (OR=1.027(95%CI=0.925 - 1.14). Conclusions: PI patients were more likely uninsured and had higher rates of pre-trauma comorbidities. Physiologically, PI patients were more likely to present with a t achycardic response to trauma. Despite this, and counter to observations in non -trauma medical conditions, the presence of PI in trauma setting did not negatively affect care delivery or mortality. Further, following exclusion of patients with isolated substance abuse and dementia the length of stay was no longer significantly different. Ou r data support the concept that PI patients may be deliberately kept in the trauma setting longer to manage symptoms such as substance withdrawal. In conclusion, our findings support the effectiveness of standardized American College of Surgeons trauma car e systems.ABSTRACT #7 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day mitochondrial calcium u niporter Division Rhode Island Hospital PI Jin O -Uchi Trainee YesNo Level UndergraduateNew Investigator Yes No Highest Degree High School Funding NIH Citation for Publication ; Please make a list of authors, one name per line Cao, J.L.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generally observed to be increased during many cardiovascular diseases including IHD. Recent results in our lab of increasing NADPH oxidase (NOX) -derived ROS improving vascular endothelial function have contradicted previous notion that decreased ROS improves vascular function. One of the most effective ways to study IHD has been to mimic human myocardial infarction in an animal model. This is achieved by occluding the Left Anterior Descending Artery (LAD ) in mice. Using this model, we study how the heart can be protected from damage resulting from IHD. In the current study, we look at supraphysiological (~2 -fold) increase in endothelial NOX -ROS in an MI model. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that an increas e in NOX-ROS in endothelial cells (EC) would improve cardiac function after MI, and we would see an increase in vascular density and reduction in infarct area. Method: Our binary (Tet -ON/OFF) conditional transgenic mouse (Tet -Nox2:VE-Cad-tTA, hence terme d Tg-Nox2) induces 1.8\u00b10.42 -fold DCF fluorescence assay and Mitosox assay were performed to validate the increase in ROS on mouse heart ECs (MHEC). Tet On and Tet Off Tg -Nox2 mice that were exposed to eight weeks of increased EC -ROSwere subject to LAD ligation. After four weeks of surgery, an echocardiogram was performed to gain understanding on the cardiac function. Co -Immunofluorescence staining on heart sections were used to quantify EdU staining for infarct Using Western blots and aspartate assays, we analyzed CPT1a expression levels and corresponding aspartate synthesis activity as measure for precursor of dNTP synthesis. Results:DCF fluorescenc e assay and Mitosox assay show an increase in ROS in Tet -OFF Tg-Nox2 mice. NOX -ROS improved recovery of post -MI heart by increasing angiogenic activity in the ischemic regions as shown by co- immunostaining using anti -CD31 and anti -SMA antibodies, and EdU immunohistochemistry. We demonstrate that there was an increase in capillary density (by 38\u00b1 6.45; p<0.05) and angiogenesis (by 2 animals showed reduction in infarct size by Trichrome staining and improvement in cardiac function including E F, LVEDV and LVESV by echocardiography. Western blot analysis showed an increase in CPT1a in Tet -OFF Tg-Nox2 MHEC compared to Tet-ON mice. A corresponding increase in Aspartate synthesis suggested an increase in the synthesis of dNTP precursor (aspartate) in Tet-OFF Tg-Nox2 ECs compared to Tet -ON MHEC. Conclusion: These findings suggest that an increase in EC -ROS may play an important role in cardiovascular health and myocardial preservation.ABSTRACT #53 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Facilitators and Barriers to Filling Narcotic Pain Medicine Prescriptions among Parents of Injured Children Post -Surgery Authors Delamerced, Department of Pediatric SurgeryDivision Pediatric Trauma Hospital Hasbro Children's Hospital PI Hale Wills, MD Trainee Yes No Level - Medical Student Masters studNew Investigator Yes No Highest Degree Bachelor Funding - Internal -Departmental Citation for Publication ; Please make a list of authors, one name per line Delamerced, A Wills, H Watson -Smith, D McRoberts, C Duncan, KTitle of Abstract :Facilitators and Barriers to Filling Narcotic Pain Medicine Prescriptions among Parents of Injured Children Post-Surgery Institutional affiliations :The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University; Hasbro Children's HospitalFacilitators and Barriers to Filling Narcotic Pain Medicine Prescriptions among Parents of Injured Children Post Delamerced, Medical of Bro wn University; Department of Pediatric Surgery -Pediatric Trauma, Hasbro Children's Hospital Background Narcotic pain medications are often prescribed to injured children but without well -defined best practice guidelines. A recent retrospective study found 65% of children were prescribed a narcotic at discharge, but 36% had no narcotic prescriptions filled in a state electronic prescription monitoring program, with children 0-6 years filling only 50%. It was unclear whether this represented over -prescribing, underutilization, or a combination. It remains unknown whether medications from filled prescriptions are actually administered, how long pain requiring narcotics lasts, or what happens to unused narcotic doses in this population. Objectives Understandparent factors impacting use or avoidance of narcotics for pain management in injured children. Methods Parents of injured children 0 -17 years admitted to Hasbro were prospectively enrolled. 2 surveys given, at discharge (demographics), and 7 -10 days later (assessing narcotic use and storage, perceptions of child's pain, alternative pain management, discharge narcotic education). Results 3.5 months into a planned 12 -month study, 47 parents have enrolled, with 63.8% follow -up rate. 64.3% reported their children were prescribed narcotic medication, with 100% filling it. Reasons for filling include provider's advice (64.7%) and belief medication would relieve pain (100%). Among parents discontinuing child's narcotics, 76.9% reported child no longer has p ain requiring it, and 15.4% reported running out. Of 82.4% who reported unused medication, 85.7% reported not disposing, and 58.3% reported no plan to dispose. All reported storing narcotics where infant/toddler cannot access it; however, 50% store in un locked bathroom cabinet, and 85.7% in unlocked kitchen space. Conclusions Majority reported only using the medication once or twice after discharge, suggesting medical providers are prescribing narcotics out of proportion to pain control injured children . Provider recommendations to fill prescriptions may be overstated as filling rates exceeded patient pain medication requests. A significant proportion of respondents report plan to retain unused narcotics while also reporting storage location is unlocked. These practices are a potential target for discharge narcotic education to reduce quantities of narcotics available for misuse. Limitations include convenience sampling and potential for recall bias. Further investigation is warranted to quantify and addressissues of pain control needs , prescribing practices, and parent education at discharge.ABSTRACT #24 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Penicillin and Ampicillin Resistance in Enterococcus faecalis Resulting from an A617T Substitution in Pbp4 and Increased Transcription of pbp4 Resulting from an Adenine Deletion in the pbp4 UP region Authors Desbonnet, John; Peti, Wolf gang Department Medicine Division Infectious Diseases Hospital Rhode Island Hospital PI Louis B.

In the few strains that have been analyzed, decreased susceptibility has been associated in one case with an increase in the quantity of low affinity Pbp4, without any associated amino acid changes in the protein itself, and in others with various amino a cid substitutions in Pbp4. We report analysis of an E. faecalis strain (LS4828) causing infection of a prosthetic knee joint that was subjected to long -term exposure to ampicillin. Subsequent cultures yielded E. faecalis with elevated MICs to ampicillin and penicillin compared to wild -type strain E. faecalisJH2-2. Sequence analysis of the pbp4structural gene and upstream region from LS4828 reveal two point mutations predicted to yield two amino acid substitutions (V223I, A617T) compared to wild -type Pbp4 and the deletion of an adenine from a seven -adenine sequence in the region upstream of the predicted Pbp4 -35 promoter sequence (UP region). RT -PCR indicated increased transcription of pbp4in LS4828 and Western blot using polyclonal Pbp4 antibody reve aled increased quantities of Pbp4 in lysates and membrane preparations from the mutant compared to JH2 -2. Placing the promoter regions from LS4828 and JH2 -2 upstream of a GFP reporter gene confirmed that the deletion of the single adenine was associated w ith increased transcription. Purified Pbp4 protein from both LS4828 and JH2 -2 exhibited a reduced affinity for BOCILLIN FL in the mutant. The reduced affinity was recapitulated by purified Pbp4 from a mutant containing only the A617T mutation. Comparat ive binding kinetics of the Pbp4 proteinswith BOCILLIN FL confirmed similar Michaelis constants and binding rates for the LS4828 and the A617T mutant. These data suggest that the reduced susceptibility to -lactam antibiotics observed in E. faecalis LS4828 results from a combination of increased expression and decreased affinity of Pbp4.ABSTRACT #54 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title A Systematic Scoping Review of Stress Management Interventions to Reduce Chronic Pain among Veterans Authors Donahue, Marissa L.; Moschella, Matthew ; Jamison, Robert N.; Carey, Michael P.; Scott -Sheldon, Lori A.

Managing stress associated with persistent pain is critical to alleviati ng pain in veterans. Objective : To identify stress management interventions (SMI) used to promote chronic pain management among veterans. Methods: Comprehensive searches of electronic bibliographic databases, ClinicalTrials.gov, and NIH RePORT were con ducted. Studies that (a) evaluated a SMI to promote chronic pain management among veterans and (b) included a control condition were included. Studies were excluded if (a) the samples included non -military participants and (b) individuals not living with chronic pain. Results: Twenty -nine studies reporting 33 interventions with a total of 1,511 par ticipants (8% women) met inclusion criteria. Included studies were published between 1983 and 2016. Studies were conducted in the United States (25), Iran (3), and Australia (1). Most studies sampled participants with combat -related pain (19, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]; 2, chronic pulmonary injury; 1, gulf war illness). Non -combat related pain was reported in seven studies (3, general pain; 1, shoulder pain; 1, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 1, rheumatoid arthritis; 1, osteoarthritis). SMIs typically included meditation: mindfulness -based stress reduction (6), mantra repetition (3), mindfulness meditation (3), mindfulness -based breathing therapy (1), and mindfulness -based cognitive therapy (1). Four interventions focused on relaxation techniques: biofeedback (2), breathing techniques (1), and relaxation training (1). Cognitive -behavioral therapy approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy (3), cognitive processing therapy (1), trauma - focused group therapy (1) and present -centered therapy (1) were also used. The remaining interventions included yoga (3), acupuncture (3), eye movement desensitization reprocessing (1), and emotional freedom techni ques (2). Controls most often completed assessments only (12 out of 29); standard care was reported in 10 studies; and 2 studies provided education -only. Four studies reported using an attention control condition (3, support group; 1, sitting quietly); a s ingle study used a placebo type control condition (sham acupuncture). Conclusions: SMIs such as meditation and relaxation techniques are offered to military veterans as alternative methods to alleviate pain associated with PTSD and other chronic pain conditions. Future research is needed to determine the potential benefits of SMIs among veterans living with chronic pain.ABSTRACT #25 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title The role of extracellular matrix proteins on neutrophil aggregation in response LeBlanc, Brian W.; Reichner, Jonathan S.

Institutional affiliations Rhode Island HospitalThe role of extracellular matrix proteins on neutrophil aggregation in response to fungal -glucan. Muhammad M. Edhi, Brian W. LeBlanc, and Jonathan S. Reichner Background : Systemic candidiasis continues to be a significant medical problem in critically ill patients with high morbidity and mortality despite available antifungal therapy. Prolonged stay in the ICU is a major risk factor for acquiring Candida infection even in the non -neutropenic patient. Neutrophils are the primary line of host defense against invasive Candida infections, and a better understanding of neutrophil -Candida interactions is therefore critical for improving patient outcomes with ongoing infection. P athogenic Candida albicans infection produces elongated hyphae resistant extracellular matrix (ECM) dependent alternate neutrophil effector mechanisms to destroy these physically large microbial structures. Complement Rec eptor 3 (CR3, CD11b/CD18) plays a pivotal role during homotypic aggregation (clustering) and NETosis by the concurrent binding to both yeast -glucan and fibronectin, initiating a complex mechanism of integrin cross -talk of the 1 integrins VLA3 (31) and VLA5 (51). Objective : The role of ECM proteins other than fibronectin remains unknown, and the current study elucidates how different matrix proteins control the anti -fungal effector functions of neutrophils under conditions that preclude phagocytosis. Methods : Human neutrophils were isolated from whole blood and added to a 6 -well tissue culture plate coated with extracellular matrix proteins and -glucan. After 30 minutes at 37\u00baC, cells were then imaged. Cluster formation was quantified using custom MatLab software from at least 5 fields per well. Results/Conclusions : We report a bimodal response where some ECMs (collagen type I and laminin) show significant increase in cluster size but not number, conversely other ECMs (collagen type IV, fibrinogen, and vitronectin) show significant increase in cluster number but not size when compared to fibronectin. Further studies are in progress to determine the mechanism involved in this dual response.ABSTRACT #17 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Neonatal l ung injury after intra -abdominal sepsis: the role of Programmed cell death receptor -1 (PD -1) in altering innate immune cells and the inflammatory environment.

DEPARTMENT: Surgery DIVISION: Surgical Research INSTITUTION: Rhode Island MD; Ayala Alfred PhD. BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated neonatal sepsis survival benefit with deletion of PD -1, an immune checkpoint protein. A mediator of septic mortality is pulmonary injury; we demonstrated worsened pulmonary edema and neutrophil influx in the presence with upregulated ligand expression and amplified cytokine release. METHODS: Our intra -peritoneal polymicrobial sepsis model entails Slurry(CS) vs. Sham injection into wildtype(WT)C57BL/6 or PD -1-/-pups. Lungs h arvested after 24 hours were assessed via flow cytometry and PD -1/PD cytokines IL -6/IL-10/TNF -. RESULTS: Consistent with previous findings on immunohistochem istry, we observed neutrophil influx following CS among a phenomenon markedly in Sham(p=0. 0031, 0.0018, 0.009 respectively), the percentage of distribution remained unchanged. Among PD-1-/-mice, however, expression of PD -L1 and PD -L2 was not upregulated either proportionally or among total cell counts, suggesting that PD -1's ligand interaction s regulate neutrophil influx into and habitation within pulmonary parenchyma. In WT, CS induced a relative increase(1.98(IQR 0.82 -4.89)) of IL -6 over Sham vs. a relative decrease among PD -1-/-lungs(0.29(IQR=0.15 -0.9;p=0.032); IL -10 echoed this relationship among WT(2.6(IQR 2.1 -5.4)) vs. PD -1-/-lungs(0.57(IQR0.25 -0.59;p=0.03)). There was no significant alteration of TNF - expression across Na \u00efve, Sham or CS lungs in either WT or PD -L1 are ubiquitously utilized in cancer therapy. Similarly, a clinical trial is currently underway investigating PD -1's role in treating adult sepsis. Evidence in the neonatal murine lungs that PD-1 deletion is protective against injury may have significant translational aspects in the future.ABSTRACT #42 25th Annual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Wearable Trauma: Fitbit Skin Pathology Authors Gallucci, G.; de la Monte, S.M.

Title of Abstract Wearable Trauma: Fitbit Skin Pathology Institutional affiliations Rhode Island Hospital, Liver Research Center Wearable Trauma: Fitbit Skin Pathology . Gina Gallucci and Suzanne M. de la Monte. Departments of Pathology, Neurology and Neurosurgery, R hode Island Hospital and the Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI Background: Wearable fitness trackers have become very popular and are manufactured by companies such as Fitbit . Wearable fitness trackers are marketed to encourage people to be mindful of their physical activity levels and thus avoid weight gain due to inadequate exercise . Millions of wearable f itness trackers are sold each year and despite lack of FDA approval, they are widely used in clinical research . An incident case of an unexpected 2nd degree wrist burn associated with wearing a Charge -2 Fitbit for 14 days inspired this study which was designed to estimate potential harm related to continuous wearing of wearable fitness trackers. A brief Web -base d review of other injuries revealed reports of multiple skin injuries link ed to continuous use of Fitbit wearable trackers. Goal/Objective: This study was designed to examine the nature of skin pathology linked to Fitbit Wearable Figness Trackers and evaluate potential causes of injury. Methods: Reports of skin injuries (mostly rashes and burns) obtained via Web-based search engines , the Fitbit Community page, and publicly accessi ble documents related to pending class action suits were reviewed, and photographs were collected for pathological classification according to the likely underlying pathogenesis . Results: The main types of skin inju ries reported were burns and rashes. The burns were either 1st degree or 2nd degree. The rashes varied in size and character, and were attributable to allergic responses to nickel or latex present in the Fitbit contact or band, respectively. Analysis of th e energy emit ted by the dual flashing gree n LEDs indicated that sufficient heat energy was produced over a 14 -day period of continuous exposure to cause a 2nd degree skin burn. Furthermore, it has been speculat ed that the open charging port that is in contact with skin c ould react with sweat and produce sodium hydroxide, with a resultant chemical burn . Conclusions: The use of wearable fitness trackers, although potentially helpful for encouraging people to maintain reasonable levels of daily activity, may not be entirely safe or free of harm for all individuals, particularly those who have allergies to nickel o r latex, and possibly those who sweat excessively with physical activity. Awareness of these potential sources of harm should be increased and made available to consumers in general, and in particular to participants in clinical research. Thoug htful redesign of tracking devices to exclude common allergens and seal all contact points would likely reduce potential for harm.

White matter myelin and oligodendrocytes are highly vulnerable targets of h ypoxic -ischemic and reperfusion injury in the perinatal period, but the processes involved have remained poorly understood due to the lack of feasible tools for molecular and biochemical research. Recent advances in MALDI imaging mass spectrometry have rendered biochemical analysis of white matter myelin pathology more accessible . Goal/Objective: Th is exploratory study assessed the feasibility of usin g matrix -assisted laser desorption/ionizatio n to characterize cerebral white matter myelin lipid abnormalities follow ing ischemia - reperfusion injury in an established fetal sheep model. Methods: Fetal sheep were subjected to a sham procedure or 30 minutes of carotid occlusion (ischemia) with 4 h, 24 h, 48 h, or 72 h of reperfusion after the ischemic insult. Pregnanc ies were terminated at 127 days (85% gestation , i.e. similar to near -term human infants ) to harvest cerebral white ma tter. Lipid s were extracted fro m fresh frozen tissue and a nalyzed by MALDI -TOF in the negative an positive ion modes using DHB as matrix . Results: T he lipid profiles associated with ischemia -reperfusion shifted dynamically over the course of reperfusion, with trends toward partial correction or normalization at the 72 hour time point. Major shifts in lipid ion expression and abundance were detected, and involved phospholipids and sphingolipids. Importantly, a number of lipids expressed in sham c ontrol brains were not detectable in the injured brains, particularly in the early phases of reperfusion, and several a lterations in lipid ion expression/abundance were detected in brains subjected to later period s of reperfusion. Conclusions: This study is the first to use MALDI -TOF to examine lipid biochemical abnormalities in fetal brain white matter subjected to ischemia -reperfusion injury . The associated white matter lipid abnormalities were substantial and modulated with the time course of reperfusion. Future studies will be extended to human brains and models in which long -term effects can be examined.

Department of Joint Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University; 4. Department of Orthopaedics, Shanghai 10th People's Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University BACKGROUND : Homeostasis of biological tissues is important to maintain human health. Disruption of homeostasis in cartilage, for example, leads to joint tissue degeneration and osteoarthritis (OA). Both mechanical stress and pro -inflammatory cytokines have been show n to play pivotal roles in OA pathogenesis [1]. However, it is unclear whether these two factors share a common mechanism to regulate the OA process. Previously we have shown that a microRNA, miR -365, is induced by both mechanical stress and pro-inflammato ry cytokine including IL -1. Furthermore, miR -365 expression is increased in OA cartilage tissues [2]. To analyze the underlying molecular mechanism by which the mechanical and inflammation sensitive microRNA regulates cartilage homeostasis and osteoarthrit is pathogenesis, in this study, we increased miR -365 expression in cartilage both in vitro and in vivo by genetic means. METHODS : The use of animals was approved by Lifespan IACUC animal studies committee. Primary chondrocytes (PC) culture ;Transient transfection;Luciferase reporter assay ;Statistical analysis. RESULTS: Through bioinformatic analysis, we found that both IL -6 and its transcription suppressor Nr1d2 harbor miR -365 binding sites in their 3' untranslated region (UTR). Nr1d2 suppresses IL -6 transcription by binding to the Retinoic Acid Receptor -Related Orphan Receptor Response Element (RORE) motif in IL -6 promoter region (Fig.1A). Furthermore, while miR -365 binding site in Nr1d2 is conserved across species, there is a point mutation in the bind ing site in mouse IL -6 (IL-6M) compared to human IL -6 (IL-6H). Analysis by site deletion and point mutagenesis demonstrated that both Nr1d2 and IL -6 were authentic targets of miR-365 (Fig.1B -C) with different sensitivities (Nr1d2 > While miR -365 Nr1d2 it inhibited IL at and IL -6M at 10x10 -2 nmol/ml (Fig.1B). This suggests that, when both Nr1d2 and IL -6 are present in a cell, miR -365 prefers to inhibit Nr1d2 thereby increasing IL -6level. To test this hypothesis, miR -365 were transfected into chondrocytes at different concentrations. While the IL -6 mRNA level stayed relatively constant in mimic -control transfected samples, its level was increased in the chondrocytes transfected with miR-365 at 2.5x10 -2 nmol/ml but decreased in the cells transfected with miR -365 at 10x10 -2 nmol/ml (Fig.2A). This observation suggested that while IL -6 level is low, Nr1d2 becomes relatively more abundant. MiR -365 would target Nr1d2 thereby increasing the IL-6 level. On the other hand, when IL -6 level is high, miR -365 would bind IL -6 thereby decreasing its level (Fig.2C). To test this model, chondrocytes were treated with IL -1 to raise downstream IL -6 levels. In the absence of IL -1 treatment, miR -365 transf ection significantly increased IL -6 protein levels. In the presence of IL-1 treatment, miR -365 significantly decreased IL -6 levels (Fig.2B). These data suggested that altering the concentration of miR -365 in chondrocytes may affect IL -6 levels and cartilag e homeostasis. In particular, increasing miR -365 level in normal young adult cartilage, which has low IL -6 level, may induce IL -6 expression and OA pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we generated and characterized the transgenic mice in which m iR-365 is overexpressed in Col II lineage cells. These mice have induced IL -6 mRNA and protein levels (Fig.3A -B) in cartilage and early onset of OA at 6 months of age (Fig.3C). CONCLUSIONS : In this study, we uncovered a mechanism in which miR -365 seemed to have two dichotomous targets, IL -6 and its transcription inhibitor Nr1d2. Through binding with different affinities, determined by the complementary nucleotide sequences between miR and its seeding site in 3'UTR ofmRNA, miR -365 targets Nr1d2 when IL-6 level is low and targets IL -6 when IL -6 level is high. Through this binary circuit, miR -365 controls IL -6 expression range thereby maintaining cartilage homeostasis.ABSTRACT #31 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Fluorescent -Conjugated Antibodies as Markers of Bacterial Infection on Surgical Sites Authors Gardezi, Mursal; Glasser, Jillian; Garcia, Dioscaris, PhD; Born, Christopher, MD; Jarrell, John, PhD Department Orthopedic Division Trauma Hospital Rhode Island Hospital PI Dioscaris Garcia Trainee YesX No Level Student (undergraduate)New Investigator Yes NoX Highest Degree: High School Funding Citation for Publication ; Please make a list of authors, one name per line Gardezi, M Glasser, J Garcia, D, PhD Born, C, MD Jarrell, J, PhDFluorescent -Conjugated Antibodies as Markers of Bacterial Infection on Surgical Sites Orthopedic, Trauma, Rhode Island Hospital, Brown UniversityFluorescent -Conjugated Antibodies as Markers of Bacterial Infection on Surgical Sites Gardezi, Mursal; Glasser, Jillian; Garcia, Dioscaris, PhD; Born, Christopher, MD; Jarrell, John, PhD, Orthopedic, Trauma, Rhode Island Hospital, Brown University. Infection is the most pressing problem facing orthopedic surgeons. Currently, t wo methods are widely utilized in modern hospitals to identify microbial infections: Traditional Culturing and Polym erase Chain Reaction (PCR). These methods are marred by issues of time, and contamination leading to false negatives and false positives, rendering them unreliable. This study aims to further validate a rapid visualization assay for detecting gram -negative and gram -positive bacteria utilizing fluorescently conjugated antibodies and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In -vitro experiments were carried against A. baumannii ,P. aeruginosa and Methicillin -Sensitive S. aureus samples, which represent comm on etiologic agents in orthopedics. These experiments further supported previous findings that fluorescent -conjugated antibodies are viable options for rapid and reliable detection of infectious agents.ABSTRACT #56 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Parents' knowledge and beliefs aboutinfant pacifier use in relation to safe sleep practice guidelines Authors Glerum, Kimberly M. ;Garro, Aris Department Emergency Medicine Division Click here to enter text.

O ne of the lesser known AAPrecommendations supported by A -level scientific evidence is offering pacifiers at nap and bedtimes. Although the mechanism is unclear, multiple studies have reported a protective effect of pacifiers on the risk of SUID. Since the most recent guidelines were published ,no studieshave specifically analyzed parents' beliefs and attitudes toward pacifier use. Goal/objective:Weused a mixed -methods approach combining survey data with open -ended interview questions to better understand parents' knowledge andbeliefs about pacifier use in relation to SUID risks. Methods:A26 itemsurvey was administered to a convenience sample of 82caregivers of infants (<6 months old) presenting to the pediatric emergency department between June andOctober2017. Following survey completion, 16participants selected at random were asked open -ended questions about their survey responses .Content analysis was used to identify themes in this interview data . Results:Of 86 parents approached, 82 agreed to participate in the survey (response rate = 95%). Of those who responded,76% reported currently offering pacifiers to their infants at sleep or nap times at least some of the time. Eighty respondents (98%) reported aw areness of safe sleep guidelines. Although 98% agreed with infants being placed on their backs to sleep, only 77% agreed that it is acceptable to offer pacifiers to infants at sleep and nap times. In open interviews, subjects frequently cited the soothing effect as reason for pacifier use, while nipple confusion, dependence, and dental problems were commonly cited concerns. Subjects often reported having had discussions about safe sleep practices with healthcare providers without pacifier use mentioned in t hese conversations. Conclusions: Many infant caregivers are not aware of the recommendation to offer pacifiers to infants at sleep times and express mixed attitudes and beliefs surrounding their use.ABSTRACT #48 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Emotion Regulation and Suicidal Ideation in an Adolescent Inpatient Population Authors Nugent, N.R.

Emerging research has also begun to suggest that difficulties with emotion regulation (ER)may have a relationship with a myriad ofpsychological disorders (Hu et al ., 2014; Seligowski et al., 2015). Despite this, there remains a gap regarding emotion regulation and its relationship to psychopathology in adolescents (Seligowski et al., 2015). A better understanding of ER in the context of psychopathology in adolescent populations, particularly adolescents endorsing suicidal ideation, has the potential to inform clinical practice. As part of an ongoing study (#R01MH105379) we aimed to examine the relationship between the frequency, durat ion, and intensity of suicidal ideation the month prior to hospitalization and emotion dysregulation in an adolescent inpatient population (N=90). Methods: Suicidal ideation was measured using the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale and emotion regulat ion was measured using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. A subset of trauma exposed participants was examined looking at the relationship between number of post -traumatic stress symptoms and ER. Trauma history and post-traumatic stress symptoms were obtained during the Clinically Administered PTSD Scale for Children and Adolescents. Measures were collected during an inpatient hospitalization for suicidal ideation. Pearson product- moment correlation coefficient s werecomputed to evaluate the rela tionship between SI and ER. Results: Results indicate a significant positive correlation between frequency of suicidal thoughts the month before hospitalization and total DERS score ( r= 0.371,p< 0.001) and a positive correlation between the duration of suicidal thoughts and total DERS score ( r= 0.221,p< 0.05). Within the trauma exposed subset (N=78), a positive correlation was found between number of Criteria D symptoms ( \"negativealterations in cognitions and mood associated with the trauma \") meeting threshold and total DERS scores ( r= 0.241,p< 0.05) (Pynoos et al., 2015). Conclusions :Results suggest emotion regulation may inform the understanding of severity of suicidal thoughts in adolescents. Further research is necessary to understand the relationship between trauma history, post -traumatic stress symptom severity, and emotion regul ation. A better understanding of each relationship may inform clinical intervention with adolescent populations. Future directions are discussed.ABSTRACT #46 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Poorer Self -Regulation is Associated with Acceptance of Cyber Dating Abuse in Early Adolescent Boys Authors Hood, Erik R; Rizzo, Christie J; Houck, Christopher D.

One area particularly impacted by this technology is adolescent romantic relationships where teens regularly engage with their dating partners though technology (Lenhart et al. , 2015). Of concern with such pervasive technology use is 26% of teens report being victims of cyber dating abuse (CDA) from a current or recent partner (Zweig et al. , 2013). Given the prevalence of technology and its potential for harm, understanding how adolescents view CDA is an important step in prevention. A number of risk factors for in -person dating violence, which may also confer risk for CDA, f irst emerge during the early adolescent years and include facets of self -regulation (Foshee et al., 2015). The current study examines early adolescent attitudes toward CDA and the association between self -regulation and CDA support. Middle school boys ages 12-14(n=95) completed a computer -based survey assessing attitudes about CDA (SNCB -A; designed for this study), emotion regulation behavioral strategies (ERBS; Houck et al., 2016), frequency of affect dysregulation (ADS; Brown et al., 2012), and short -term self-regulation of emotions, thoughts, attention, and behaviors (ASRI; M oilanen, 2007) . Findings indicate that, regardless of dating experience, many middle -school aged boys believe it is OK to engage in CDA behaviors (see Table 1). Furthermore, boys reporting more challenges with emotion regulation behaviors were more like ly to endorse CDA -accepting attitudes ( r=.231,p<.05), as were those with poorer short -term self-regulation (r=.307,p<.01). Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that early adolescents reporting fewer short -term self- regulation abilities (e.g., a n inability to calm down when excited or wound up) were more likely to endorse accepting CDA attitudes, even when demographic factors and other facets of self -regulation (i.e., use of behavioral regulation strategies, level of dysregulation experiences) we re controlled ( b=0.23,p<.01). In sum, a surprising number of early adolescent males endorsed attitudes supporting CDA. Short -term self-regulation focused on emotions, thoughts, attention, and behaviors was found to be particularly important to CDA accep tance suggesting that these broad forms of self -regulation may be important targets for CDA prevention among early adolescent males.ABSTRACT #59 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Hepatocyte apoptosis is linked to decreased TET1 and 5 - hydroxymethylcytosine in rat alcoholic liver disease J.R.; Huang, C.

The 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a newly identified epigenetic modification and believed to regulate DNA demethylation. However, there is lit tle information regarding how chronic ethanol consumption modulates 5hmC expression and promotes ALD progression. Methods: A Long -Evans rat ALD model was employed in this study. Human ALD samples were also analyzed to validate 5hmC expression. Real -time qu antitative PCR and protein based immunoassays were used to evaluate how 5hmC may be down -regulated through decreased TET1 -methylcytosine dioxygenase TET1 inhibition and shRNA -TET1 to delinea te the impact on ethanol induced hepatocyte apoptosis. We also explored how decreased TET1 -mediated 5hmC may be involved in ALD progression by using the DNA methylation inhibitor, 5 -Azacytidine. Results: It was found that chronic ethanol feeding significan tly reduced 5 -hmC expression in the ALD model. The 5 -hmC is regulated by the TET family of enzymes; thus, the expression levels of TET family enzymes and the hypoxia -inducible factor 1 (HIF1) were determined. There were no significant changes in TET2, TE T3, and HIF1 levels between control -and ethanol -fed groups. In contrast, TET1 protein expression was substantially reduced in the ethanol -fed Long -Evans rats. The decreased TET1 was accompanied by increased hepatocyte apoptosis. Consistent with this obse rvation, \"knockdown\" human hepatocytes also hepatocyte apoptosis. More important, down -regulation of TET1 resulted in elevated expression of H2AX, suggesting that alterations of 5hmC enhanced DNA damage as well. The propo sed mechanisms revealed that inhibit ion of TET1 enhanced HRK and GADD45 expression which contributed to both hepatocyte apoptosis and DNA damage. Consistent with this hypothesis was the results of a challenge with a TET1 inhibitor, (desferrioxamine ) which also enhanced apoptosis, DNA damage as well as HRK, and GADD45 expression. Exposure of hepatocytes to 5 -Azacitidine substantially reversed apoptosis, DNA damage, HRK, and GADD45 expression levels. Conclusion s:Chronic ethanol consumption promotes hepatocyt e apoptosis and DNA damage by diminishing TET1 -mediated DNA methylation. Therefore, TET1 may be a potential therapeutic target in ALD.ABSTRACT #62 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Transcription factor SREBP2 mediates ovarian cancer drug resistance and recurrence Authors Karashchuk, Galina and Brodsky, Alexander S.

Brodsky, A. S.Title of Abstract Transcription factor SREBP2 mediates ovarian cancer drug resistance and recurrence Institutional affiliations RhodeIsland Hospital/ Brown UniversityTranscription factor SREBP2 mediates ovarian cancer drug resistance and recurrence Department of Pathology Rhode Island Hospital Background: Ovarian cancer, the most lethal gynecological malignancy has a poor prognos is.Existing chemotherapies are challenged by the emergence of drug resistance and metastasis of tumor cells, which obstruct sustained, relapse -free patient cures. Resistance can emerge from pre -existing mutations, secondary mutations, or other non -geneticmechanisms or metabolic adaptations. SREBPs are necessary for cell survival in low nutrient conditions. SREBP2 is a sterol sensitive transcription factor regulating cholesterol homeostasis including the expression of LDLR and HMGCR. Recent reports sugges t thatSREBP2 may promote mesenchymal and stem -cell states. These observations support our working hypothesis that the regulation of cholesterol and fatty acids through SREBP2 is critical for drug tolerance, resistance, and viability of a cancer stem cell population. Goal/Objective: To evaluate the function of SREBP2 in drug tolerant and cancer stem cells. Methods: We evaluated expression of SREBP2 and the cholesterol pathway upon drug treatment. We generated stable ovarian cancer cell lines targeting the SREBF2gene using CRISPR technology . We sued a variety of approaches to characterize these cells including: counting the number of viable cells, the cell cycle analysis by FACS , expression by qPCR and immunobl otting, evaluate stem cell Results: SREBF2-KD cellswere more sensitive to statin and paclitaxel in low sterol environments compared to control cells. Reduced SREBP2 expression limited the ability of ovarian cancer cells to survive paclitaxel treatment and surviving cells were more sensitive to statins. SREBP2 also affects the cancer cells' rates of going through the cell cycle. Conclusion: SREBP2 is a targetable transcription factor that mediates drug tolerance of ovarian cancer c ells.These data suggest that targeting SREBP2 may represent a new approach to eliminate cancer cells that survive initial treatment.

From the Departments of Pathology, Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital and the Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the third most common form of dementing neurodegenerative disease in the United States. The majority of FTLD cases are sporadic with familial cases representing up to 20% of all cases. Dominant clinical manifesta tions include behavioral disturbances and language deficits. Brains affected by FTLD show progressive and ultimately severe atrophy with early and striking involvement of the frontal and temporal lobe s. Currently, there is relatively little information abo ut molecular pathogenic mechanisms underlying FTLD. The present study evaluated frontal and temporal lobe expression levels of neurotrophin s and neurotrophin receptors (Rs) in postmortem brains from patients with clinical and neuropathological diagnoses of FTLD. This research was inspired by previous reports demonstrating alterations in neurotrophin signaling in Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) disease s, combined with the frequent overlaps between FTLD and AD or PD . Homogenates of fresh frozen samples from Brodmann Area (BA) 8/9, BA24, and BA38 were used by direct-binding ELISA . The results show significant increases in the expression of NGF, NT3, HNE, ubiquitin, and insulin and significant decreases in BDNF, NT4, trk neurotrophin receptor, and IGF1 as compared to controls. This suggests that FTLD pathology is in part driven by abnormalities in the expression of neuroendocrine and neurotrophin molecules. The mechanism causing neuronal loss in FTLD may involve aberrant cell signalin g, leading to subsequent dysregulation of cell growth, stability, and differentiation.

Following peripheral nerve injury, Egr2 expression is downregulated, resulting in initiation of demyelination. However, the role of epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate Egr2 expression in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) during nerve injury response have not been established. We have previou sly described a long non -coding RNA antisense to the promoter of Egr2 (Egr2 -AS-RNA) and its regulation after sciatic nerve injury. Goal/Objective: To study mechanisms of regulation and function of the Egr2 long antisense RNA. Methods: Weperformed sciatic nerve injury in mice. Employed a biodegradable hydrogel infused with oligonucleotide GapMers to inhibit the Egr2 -AS-RNA in vivo. S amples were analyzed by qPCR, Western Blot, IP, ChIP and RNA -IP. We used primary Rat Schwann Cells to perform Dephosphorylation of Ser184 of YY1 after sciatic nerve injury regulates the direct binding of YY1 to the Egr2 -AS-RNA. In addition, the expression of the Egr2 -AS-RNA is indirectly regulated by PP1 since increased expression of PP1 in Schwann cells induces dephosphorylation of YY1 and increased binding of YY1 to the Egr2 -AS-RNA . Finally, we present evidence for the role of the Egr2 -AS-RNAas part of a transcriptional reg ulatory network involving Egr2, YY1 and c -Jun that is responsible for the generation of the denervated Schwann cell phenotype following peripheral nerve injury. Conclusions: Here we describe the function of a long non -coding antisense RNA on the transcriptional regulation of nerve injury response .ABSTRACT #66 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Endotoxin levels at the maternal -fetal interface and the association with intrauterine growth.

Emily A. McDonald1,2,*, Hannah W. Low-and middle -income countries (LMICs) carry a high burden of parasitic diseases that are associated with impaired gut integrity. Children in many of these countries also experience a high rate of poor intrauterine growth. We hypothesized that factors culminating in micr obial translocation (i.e. schistosome and/or hookworm infection, alcohol consumption) during pregnancy may negatively impact fetal growth by changing the microbial load of the placenta. The placental microbiome is suggested to reflect colonization, in part , via hematogenous spread, and has been linked to poor pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth. We examined the association between specific risk factors for impaired gut integrity and endotoxin, a key component of the cell wall of gram -negative bacteria, in blood collected from the maternal -fetal interface (MFI) and the umbilical cord at delivery. In addition, we examined the relationship between endotoxin levels and poor intrauterine growth. We utilized samples collected from a recently completed trial, in which women with schistosomiasis were randomized to praziquantel treatment or placebo at 12 -16 weeks gestation. None of the risk factors examined had an impact on the endotoxin levels at the MFI, although there were trends for higher endotoxin at the MF I in women who received praziquantel ( P= 0.08) and drinks/week; P= 0.06 ) during pregnancy. Maternal alcohol consumption increased the amount of endotoxin found in cord blood (1.8 -fold higher, P= 0.01) and c ord blood endotoxin levels were associated with higher levels of free amino acids in fetal circulation ( P< 0.01). In keeping with these data, infants born small for gestational age (SGA) also had higher levels of endotoxin at the MFI ( P= 0.03). Our findings sugge st that maternal alcohol consumption may contribute to gut microbial translocation, increasing levels of endotoxin at the MFI and cord blood. These alterations in the microbial abundance at the MFI and in fetal circulation may contribute to the poor growth in utero associated with pre -natal alcohol exposure.ABSTRACT #15 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title 3D Illustration to Quantify Volume of Subdural and Diagnostic Imaging, Emergency Medicine , NeurosurgeryDivision Division of Emergency Neurosciences Hospital Rhode Island Hospital PI-Multi Derek Merck PhD & Lisa Merck MD MPH Trainee Yes NoX Level Choose an item.New Investigator Yes NoX Highest Degree Funding MD PhD Funded by NIH NINDS Citation for Publication ; Please make a list of authors, one name per line Last name, Initials Merck, D.

Recent advances in 3D illustration (3DI) can precisely quantify intracranial pathology on computed tomography (CT). The current standard of measurement, ABC/2, demonstrates v ariability in precision with bleed phenotype. The aim of this project is to assess the accuracy automated 3DI and compare it to standard ABC/2 measurements. METHODS Baseline CT scans (n=881) collected during the ProTECTIII multicenter clinical trial were retrospectively reviewed by a Subdural and epidural hematomas were identified (n=260). ABC/2 volume estimation was performed by the MCCT central neuroradiology team in order to provide the estimated volume according to the current clinical standard, using OsiriX and RadiAnt software. 3D Illustration (3DI) was performed by research staff blinded to ABC/2 results, using Aquarius and 3D Slicer software. All CT DCM data were resampled to symmetrical, 1.5 mm slices. Each slice was manual ly traced to gen erate high -precision 3D volumes. Hemorrhages were divided into two groups based on volume of hemorrhage: Group 1 (<50 cm3; n=195) and Group 2 ( 50 cm3; n=65). Agreement was assessed via Bland -Altman analysis. RESULTS & CONCLUSIONS There is a significant difference betwe en the results of the 3DI and ABC/2 methods. In Group 1, the estimated relative bias between the two measurements (after transformation) is 0.17 (SD 1.16; pvalue 0.044; 95% CI 0.005, 0.333). In Group -0.712, 1.22, pvalue <0.0001, 95% CI (-1.013, -0.410). The 3DI method calculates detailed surface area measurements in large and small volume hemorrhages, while ABC/2 averages cross -sectional area. The ABC/2 estimates vary by bleed phenotype and offer le ss topographical precision than 3DI. This is particularly true in extra -axial hemorrhages, which are frequently crescent -shaped and irregular. The 3DI method produces a more detailed measurement of brain hemorrhage than ABC/2, data important to patient tre atment and prognostication. Figure 1.

Our team applied GDT to standardize care in patients with moderate to severe TBI, who were enrolled in a large multicenter clinical trial. METHODS Physiologic goals were defined a priori in order to standardize care across 42 sites participating in the ProTECT III trial. Data were collected hourly for all randomized subjects (n=882). The proportion of hours spent in transgression was calculated for each parameter and grouped by quartile. Poor outcome was defined via stratified dichotomy of the GOS -E.Data were adjudicated electronically and via expert review. The association between outcome and eithe r (1) occurrence of transgression or (2) cumulative duration of transgression was estimated via logistic regression, backward selection was used to identify the physiologic parameters associated with outcome. Subgroup analyses were performed in subjects wi th intracranial monitoring (tICP, n=433). Parameters significant at alpha 0.01 are reported. RESULTS Mortality was 17.2% and 23.2% in the full and tICP cohorts. Prolonged duration of transgression was associated with increased mortality for: the tICP subgroup prolonged duration of transgression was associated with single occurrence of transgression was related to increased mortality when INR>1.4 (p<0.0001), and in (p=0.0005).

Objective: Characterize the protective efficacy of a novel blood -stage malaria vaccine. Methods: 1)generalized estimating equations were used to assess the epidemiological association between high levels of natural antibodies against PF3D7_1134300 and parasitemia inchildren from a longitudina l birth cohort study in Tanzania ,2) the functional capacity of purified IgG from immunized mice was tested using growth/invasion inhibition assays, 3) immunofluorescence confocal and immunogold electron microscopy were used to localize the protein in infected RBCs, and 4) BALB/cJ mice were challenged with mouse malaria after immunizations with a recombinant P. berghei ortholog of PF3D7_1134300 High levels of monospecific antibodies ( >2.5percentile s) from 540 Tanzanian children 1to 3.5 years of age ( 14,722 observations) were associated with an almost 50% reduction in parasite densities on blood smears (124 vs 68 parasites/200 WBC; p=0.04) .This effect size issimilar to th at of sickle cell trait and bednet us e(proven protective factors )in the same cohort .Purified IgGfrom mouse antisera inhibited p arasite growth /egress from RBCs in a dose -dependent fashion by up to 75% compared to pre -immune controls. Native protein is expressed in themid-latestages of surface membrane despite lacking a recognizable export signal .Miceimmunized with an adjuvanted murine longer median survival (p=0.014) ,and 2/5 mice (40%) totally eradicated the parasites, which is unprecedented . Conclusions: We designate PF3D7_1134300 -1 (PfEMMA -1)based on findings from immunolocalization imaging studies. These data support development of PfEMMA -1as a viable vaccine candidate, and present a unique opportunity to elucidate poorly understood mechanisms of protein export and immune protectionABSTRACT #39 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Clinical Outcome Analysis of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBO2T) in Chronic Wounds: A Retrospective Study Authors Mookerjee, Vikram, G.; Wang, Xiaotian; Liu, Paul, Y.

We aimed to analyze the clinical outcomes of HBOT treated chronic wounds to pro vide evidence for optimizing the HBOT. Methods: All patients whoreceivedHBOTtreatment at Rhode Island Hospital Wound Center from September 2013 to August 2017 wereincluded in this chart review study. Total 76 patient charts were reviewed.The clinical data of 46 patients with open chronic wounds and more than 8 HBOT treatments was analyzed. Thewound sizes were analyzed at 4 time points: initial wound size ( first presentation to the Wound Center),before HBOT ( after wound care ), aftercompletingHBOT, and afterfollow up . Results:Total 57 wounds were analyzed. 34 wounds were diabetic ulcers (59.6%), 13 radiation related surgical wounds (22.8%). Most wounds (82.5%) recieved more than 20 HBOT. Immediately after finishing HBOT, 30 wounds (70%) healed more than 30%, comparing to the sizes before HBOT. 10 wounds (17.5%) healed.After standard wound care, 22wounds(38.6%) healed more than 30% comparing to the initialsizes, while 30 wounds (52.6%) healed less than 10%. Among all improved wounds (>30%), HBOT healed 80.8 \u00b122.6% vs standard wound care 60.4\u00b118.5% (p<0.001). 45 patients (86.5%) were followed up post -HBOT for average 6 months. No healed wounds re -opened. Among non -healing wounds after HBOT, 33 wounds were followed up. 29 wounds healed more than 30% (96.2 \u00b19.4%), significantly higher than pre -HBOT wound care (p<0.001). 25 wounds were healed in follow -up, thus total 35 wounds (61.4%) were healed after HBOT. Conclusion: Wedemonstrated that HBOT significantly improved chronic wound to standard wound care. HBOT alsoaugmentedthe wound healingratesin the follow up period. We noticed 30% of wounds did not respond to HBOT. This study may provide clinical evidence for optimizing HBOT in chronic wounds.ABSTRACT #21 25th Annual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Arecoline: the overlooked nitrosamine and its neurodegenerative effect Authors Moriel, Natalia A. ; Kalagara, Roshini; de la Monte, Suzanne M.

From the Departments of Pathology, Neurology, and Neurosurgery, Rhode Island Hospital and the Alpert Medical School of Brown University, and Brown University, Providence, RI Background The areca nut has been a popular masticatory in Southeast Asia for centuries; it is currently estimated that 600 million people consume it. Mastication of the nut provides a nicotine -like feel - good effect mediated by its main active ingredient's - arecoline -agonistic properties on muscarinic and nicotinic AChR. Experimental evidence from Dr De la Monte 's laboratory has demonstrated the negative effect of nitrosamines on the body, resulting in: insulin resistance diseases including diabetes and Alzheimer -type neurodegeneration. Goal/Objective To look at the cognitive impairments and neuro degenerati ve effects resulting from early -life arecoline exposure using a rat model. Methods Long Evans rat pups were treated with saline or Arecoline Hydrobromide (AH) via a series of intraperitoneal injections (0.5, 1mg) on postnatal (P) days 3,5 & 7 or a single intracerebral injection (0.1, 0.2mg) on P3. Data on body weight was continuously recorded. A Rotarod test was performed on P15&16 to assess for cerebellar and motor function. Spatial learning/memory was tested on P25 using a Morris Water Maze test. On P35, rats were euthanized with isoflurane and their brains harvested. Immunohistochemical analyses were conducted to look for brain development anomalies. Pro tein levels in the temporal lobe were evaluated using ELISAs. To assess for immediate neurotoxic injury, rats were treated with AH or Sal on P3, euthanized on P5 and an LDH assay was performed after 72 hrs culture. Results A decline in performance on the Rotarod and MWM test was observed in the AH groups. Histopathology showed a reduction in white matter in the cerebella and hippocampi of the rat pups. Expression of pTau, GFAP and 8OHdG in the AH group was higher than controls. LDH was found in high conce ntrations in the slice cultures. Conclusions AH treatment results in impaired cerebellar function and spatial learning/memory. i.c. AH had greater neurodegenerative effects than i.p. AH . The main histopathological effects of AH include : hypotrophy of the cerebellum with impaired neuronal growth/survival and reduced white matter development and impaired growth of cerebral white matter . AH causes neurotoxic injury mediated by mitochondrial DNA damage . Early increases in pTau reflects one of the insulin resis tances changes in AD brains .

We reported that post-translational modification of ryanodine receptors (RyR2) aberrant Ca2+handling in cardiomyocytes from aging rabbit hearts (Cooper et al. J Physio l.2013) .Autophagy, a recyc ling process that degreades cellular like mitochondria, is downregulated in aging. Abnormal mitochondrial morphology regulated by unbalanced fission and fusion is frequently reported to change with age. OBJECTIVE: M echanisms of how mitochondri al morphology, ROS, and dysfu nction initiates arrhythmogenesis in the aging heart remains elusive .We posit a utophagy signaling is a critical modulator of mitochondrial function and Ca2+handling in the aging cardiomyocyte. RESULTS: We confirmed mitochond rial autophagy machinery is significantly down -regulated in the aging rabbit heart by altered protein expression p62, protein 1 ,increased in the aging rabbit heart ,whereas fusion protein, mitofusin 2, was unchanged. Ultra -structure analysis revealed mitochondria with greater variance in mitochondrion cross - sectional area .Healthy HL -1 cardiomyocytes treated theautophagy blocker chloroquine (1 hrs ) showe d an increase in mito ROS production, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, upregulation of fissio n proteins, and downregulation of autophagy oxidation observed decreased latency to spontaneous Ca2+wave formation after 20 seconds of 1.0-hzfield electrical stimulation under - adrenergic stimulation (100 nM isoproterenol, 5 minutes) andlarger proportion of cells exhibiti ng after treatment. The mitoROS ,and normalized with autophagy enhancer, Torin1 (250 nM), for 6 hours resulted in decreased mitoROS ,hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, and half the instance of pro -arrhythmic spontaneous Ca2+waves. CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing autophagy signaling derived ROS ,RyR2 oxidatio n, and result edin formation of pro -arrhythmic Ca2+waves. Conversely, activation of autophagy in aged primary rabbit cardiomyocytes reduced pro -arrhythmic Ca2+ waves. We conclude that decreased autophagy contributes to pro -arrhythmic changes in the aging cardiomyocyte and promoting autophagy may reduce lethal arrhythmogenesis .ABSTRACT #60 25th Annual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Targeting b-hydroxylase J.R.

Title of Abstract Targeting aspartate b-hydroxylase suppresses cholangiocarcinoma metastasis Institutional affiliations Liver Research Center, Rhode Island Hospital and the Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI Background & Aim: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a devastating disease with a dismal prognosis. The incidence and mortality rates of CCA have increased globally over the past few decades. If CCA spreads outside the liver, the 5 year-survival is only 2%, suggesting a need to develop more effective therapy against CCA invasion and metastasis. Aspartate b-hydroxylase (ASPH) is highly expressed in CCA and promotes tumor cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. We have previously demonstrated that targeting ASPH substantially diminished CCA tumor growth. Here, we access the therapeutic potential of modulating ASPH activity on CCA metastasis to the lung. Methods: To determine how ASPH may be involved in CCA metastasis, we targeted ASPH using either molecular or pharmacological approaches. ASPH activity was inhibited by shRNA transfected into CCA tumor cells via a lentiviral system or the use of ASPH inhibitor compounds. A migration assay was performed using both a rat (BDEneu-CL24) and human CCA cell lines. In this context, HuCCT1 and SSP25 cells were treated with either shRNA-ASPH or ASPH inhibitor. A rat syngeneic CCA metastatic model to the lung was generated by inoculating BDEneu-CL24 cell into the liver to form the primary orthotopic tumor which was subsequently used to determine the role of ASPH inhibitors on primary tumor growth, progression and metastasis. Metastatic foci in the lung were quantified after 18 days of exposure to ASPH inhibitors. Additionally, metastasis-associated protein expression, that includes the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), were determined in CCA tumors by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) as a potential mechanism for promoting metastatic spread to the lungs from the primary site in the liver. Results: Knockdown of ASPH substantially decreased CCA migration and invasion in HuCCT1 and SSP25 cells. The ASPH inhibitors also reduced cell migration in BDEneu-CL24, HuCCT1 and SSP25 cells. In the rat CCA metastasis model, we observed that the ASPH inhibitors significantly suppressed metastasis of CCA to the lungs. There was also down-regulations of MMP2 and MMP14 protein expression in the primary liver tumor. Inhibition of the malignant phenotype was also observed in human CCA cells treated with shRNA-ASPH. Our results suggest that ASPH mediated CCA migration, invasion and metastases were due, in part, to upregulation of MMP gene expression in the primary tumor. Conclusion: It was demonstrated that ASPH inhibition suppressed CCA metastasis by reducing MMPs upregulation both in vitro and in vivo. These observations suggest a potential therapeutic approach for intrahepatic CCA with metastasis.

PfSEA -1-specific resistance is mediated through antibodies. In the last decade, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells have been recognized as essential for long -lived plasma and memory B cell f ormation and high -affinity antibody production. Goal/Objective: Given the role of Tfh cells in promoting protective antibody responses to vaccine antigens, generating effective Tfh responses is likely essential for optimization of vaccine candidates likePfSEA -1A. Methods: To advance rPfSEA -1A (aa 810 -1083) as a vaccine candidate, we determined frequencies and subtypes of circulating Tfh cells in children (6.5yrs) from Western Kenya using PBMCs stimulated with PfSEA -1A or control antigens. PfSEA -1A-speci antibody levels were also measured Results: Increases in anti -PfSEA data demonstrate that a single malaria antigen can drive expansion of distinct Tfhcells subsets. Identification of antigens capable of driving Tfh cell responses and Tfh cell specific epitopes within these antigens are the next step in driving single antigen vaccine candidates to clinical trials.CM Tfh1-like PD-1+ + Helper activity 0 1 2 3 LN CM CXCR5+CXCR3+CCR6-PD1+ICOS- Tfh1 like cellsABSTRACT #4 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Advance -CTR: Statewide Infrastructure to Support Clinical & Translational Research Authors Padbury, J.F., Hawrot, E.

In addition, murine pulmonary vascular endothelial c MCT -injured mice have lower rates of apoptosis and have increased expression of anti -apoptotic genes compared with mPVECs cultured with EVs from healthy mice. We wished to determine if changes in miR ex pression of mPVECs exposed to EVs from MCT -injured vehicle (PBS) -injected mice for 7 days. microarray analysis was pe rformed on cultured mPVEC. miRNA species of interest were defined as miRNAs uniquely up -or down -regulated in mPVECs after culture vs. but not up -or down - regulated in mPVECs cultured with vehicle mouse EVs vs. control mPVECs). Results: We identified 15, 35 and 26 distinct miR species that were up -regulated and 19, 28 and 24 distinct miR species that were down -regulated in mPVECs cultured with MCT -LEVs, PEVs and BEVs but not in mPVECs cultured those EVs from vehicle mice. miRs -107 and -449a were commonly up -regulated in mPVECs exposed to all three MCT -EV populations (125 -, 213 -, 124 -fold increase in mPVECs cultured with up -regulated in mPVECs after culture with three EV populations previously demonstrated to induce features of PH in healthy animals and an anti -apoptotic phenotype in cultured mPVECs. It has been reported that miR -107 is among the hypoxia -induced miRNAs and it's over expression leads to the decrease in pro -apoptotic signaling in a variety of cancer cell lines. Although these studies did not determine if EV -based miR -107 is de livered to mPVECs in culture or if miR-107 is expressed de novo in response to exposure to these EVs, they suggest that mPVEC expression of miR -107 EV -induced PH.ABSTRACT 25thAnnual Celebration Day Title Adolescent Cyberbullying Intervention Development: Results from a Qualitative Investigation into Teens' Perspectives and Preferences Authors Pittman, Sarah K. ; Ranney, Megan L.

Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences ,Brown University Ranney, Megan L. Department of Emergency Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital; Alpert Medical School of Brown Un iversity Background: Approximately 25% of adolescents (ag e 13-17) report past -year cyber victimization . Cybervictimization is correlated with negative mental health outcomes, such as depressive symptoms, suicidality, and substance use. Few interventions a re effective in reducing or preventing cybervictimization and its negative outcomes. Although pediatricians are urged to discuss cyberbullying with patients, no feasible and effective interventions exist for the primary care setting. Our prior work shows t hat a brief intervention + longitudinal text -message intervention decreases adolescent physical violence. Objective: To adapt prior brief interventions and longitudinal text -message interventions for adolescent primary care patients reporting cybervictimiz ation.Method: English-speaking adolescents, age 13 -17, presenting to an urban pediatric clinic for care, were administered a validated survey on cyberbullying. Those reporting past - year cyber -victimization were invited to complete a one -hour semi -structured interview about their experiences with cybervictimization and preferences for a brief in -person intervention and text message program. Interviews were audio -recorded and transcribed. Inductive and deductive codes were developed through team consensus. Results:23 adolescents consented and completed the interview. Mean age was 14.8 years, 65.2% were female, mean CBS score was 7.36. Themes about cyberbullying included a) adolescents experience a range of online conflict, from \"jokes that went too far\" to s evere cyberbullying; b) although all adolescents had objectively experienced cybervictimization, few self -identified as such; they defined cyberbullying by its severe negative mental health consequences; c) online and in -person conflict and bullying have a high degree of overlap; d) adolescents' status (e.g. bully, bystander, etc.) are not static and can change over time. Prevention themes included: a) content should be specific, realistic, and easily actionable; b) teens would \"buy in\" to the intervention more if it addressed peer relationships in general, rather than cyberbullying specifically; c) content should address how bystanders can intervene in online conflict; d) a variety of mediums would be acceptable and engaging to teens (e.g. text messages, vi deos, PowerPoint presentations, website). Conclusions: To develop effective and acceptable interventions for adolescent online conflict, it is important to understand the current culture of adolescents' social media use and conflict. Interventions should b e flexible to mold to each adolescents' experience and meet their changing social circumstances.ABSTRACT #22 25th Annual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Therapeutic Advantages of the Hybrid PPAR -/ Agonist, T3D -959 Versus Independent Targeting of PPAR - and PPAR - in an Experimental Model of Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease Authors Dustine Reich, Gina Gallucci, Ming Tong M.D. and Suzanne M. de la Monte M.D. M.P.H.

Although deficiencies in brain insulin and IGF could be ameliorated with trophic factors, impairments in receptor expression, binding, and tyrosine kinase activation require alternative strategies. Peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor (PPAR) agonists target genes downstream of insulin/IGF stimulation. Furthermore, their anti -oxidant and anti - inflammatory effects address other pathologies contributing to neurodegeneration. Objectives: The goal of this research was to co mpare effects of T3D -959, a hybrid PPAR - / agonist, with dual delivery of separate L165,041 (PPAR -) and F -L-Leu (PPAR -) agonists for remediating early stages of neurodegeneration. Methods : Experiments were conducted using frontal lobe slice cultures f rom an intracerebral Streptozotocin (i.c. STZ) rat model of AD. Results: the hybrid (T3D -959) and dual PPAR agonist treatments increased indices of neuronal and myelin maturation and mitochondrial proliferation, and decreased neuroinflammation, A, neurotoxicity, and oxidative T3D -959 increased expression. the PPAR -+ and lipid peroxidation in cultures from i.c. STZ treated rats. Conclusions: T he findings suggest that T3D -959 has more positive and fewer negative effects than PPAR -+ for targeting of cellular pathologies linked to AD -type neurodegeneration. A novel feature of T3D -959 is that with cellular delivery, PPAR - and PPAR - are activate d at 80:20 ratios, corresponding with their relative expressions in the brain.

Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, Rhode Island Hospital Background: A recent study [Newton -Cheh et al., Nature Genetics 41, 399 -406 (2009)] identified an association, with genome -wide significance, between a single nucleotide polymorphism approximately 12 kb downstream of the gene encoding the RING finger ubiquitin ligase rifiylin (RFFL) and the QT interv al. Goal: We sought to determine the role of RFFL in cardiac electrophysiology. Methods: Neonatal rabbit cardiomyocytes infected with adenoviral vectors were subjected to optial imaging to determine action potential duration (APD). Adult rabbit cardiomyo cytes infected with adenoviral vectors were subjected to whole -cell patch clamp to measure IKrandIto.HEK cells were transfected with expression plasmids for the voltage -gated potassium channel Kv4.2 and Kv1.4 , RFFL and a mutation thereof. Surface biotin ylation and western blotting were performed to measure surface and total levels of HERG. Co -immunoprecipitations were done to check for protein/protein interactions. Also, Itowas measured by whole cell patch clamp. Results: Neonatal rabbit cardiomyocytes infected with RFFL -expressing In adult cardiomyocyt es, RFFL overexpression reduced IKrand the fast levels but upregulated Kv4.2 expression its accessory subunit KCHIP2. Furthermore, RFFL overe xpression and mono biquitination of Kv1.4 ,which was dependent on the intact RING domain of RFFL .This was also reflected in an increase in the respective current, Ito,slow. Conclusions: There is strong evidence that RFFL is an important regulator of action potential duration likely via effects o n voltage -gated potassium channels such as HERG , Kv4.2, and Kv1.4 .ABSTRACT #33 25thAnnual Celebration Day Title Imparting Antibiotic -Independent Antimicrobial Properties to Surgical Sutures and Prosthetic Liners With a Silver -doped Coating Authors Daniel Roque; Dioscaris Garcia, PhD; and Christopher Born, MD Department Orthopedics Division Division of biology and Medicine Hospital Rhode Island Hospital PI Christopher Born, MD Trainee YesX No Level Choose an item.New Investigator Yes NoX Highest Degree Funding Citation for Publication ; Please make a list of authors, one name per line Roque, D1 Garcia, D123 Born, C123Imparting Antibiotic -Independent Antimicrobial Properties to Surgical Sutures and Prosthetic Liners With a Silver-doped Coating Brown University,1Diane Weiss Center for Orhtopaedic Trauma Research2, Rhode Island Hospital3Imparting Antibiotic -Independent Antimicrobial Properties to Surgical Sutures and Prosthetic Liners With a Silver - doped Coating Roque, D12; Garcia, D123; Born, C123. Brown Trauma Research2, Rhode Island Hospital3 Background/ Objective: Amputees face a tremendous challenge post -surgery because of the vulnerability of their wounds. T he transcutaneous fixation of sutures, which have been found to be sites for bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, allows for a means of infection. Amputees face additional challenges later on with the use of prosthetics due to the extreme condition of stump-liner interface in the prosthetic socket, which promotes epidermal irritation, microbial growth, and eventual infection. The goal of this project is to validate the biocompatible chemistry formulations of a silver -doped coating and to test its antim icrobial efficacy on sutures and prosthetic liners. Methods: We first generated dose response curves against MSSA of formulations differing in amounts of heptane, hexane, xylenes, and silver to test the efficacy of the coating independent of the liners an d sutures. We then continued to test the most effective chemistries via the Kirby -Bauer assay. PDMS, isopropanol, and titanium -isopropoxide. Commercially available prosthetic liners of Keasy and S ilicone material were punch biopsied into 8mm plugs. The most commonly used sutures, Ethibond -X306 and Fiberwire, were cut into pieces 1cm in length. The plugs and sutures were then dip coated with the most effective chemistries before they were plated on a bacterial lawn of MSSA at 1E9CFU/mL. Zones of inhibition were imaged and measured at the 24, 48, and 72 -hour time points. Results:We found the 95% PDMS -Heptane and the 95% PDMS -Hexane to be the most effective formulations at bacterial inhibition on b oth the prosthetic liners and sutures. The 10x doping concentration of silver was the most effective at preventing bacterial growth across all formulations. The zones of inhibition for all trials maintained well beyond the 72 - hour time point. Conclusion: The silver -doped antimicrobial coating formulations tested in this study proved effective in preventing colonization of MSSA, the most common agent for epidermal infection. Due to its efficacy as an antimicrobial agent on both prosthetic liners and sutures , the coating appears to be a promising solution for wound care and infection prevention not only for amputees, but also for all patients with transcutaneous sutures.ABSTRACT #50 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Examining the Relationship Between Alcohol and Marijuana Use, Sensitivity to Reward, and Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors (STBs) Authors Adam Rosenfeld, Dr. Laika Aguinaldo, Dr. Leslie Brick, Dr. Nicole Nugent Department Psychiatry Division Click here to enter text.

Aguinaldo, L.D. Brick, L.A. Nugent, N.R.Title of Abstract Examining the Relationship Between Alcohol and Marijuana Use and Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors (STBs) Institutional affiliations Rhode Island Hospital, Brown University, NIMHBackground : Increases in the adolescent suicide rate have underscored the urgency for dealing with this public health crisis. In 2014, suicide was the 2nd leading cause of death for ages 10 -24(CDC2014). The suicide rate for males between 15 -19 increased by 31% from 2007 -2015, while the suicide rate for females between 15 -19 almost doubled in that same time period.(CDC MMWR, 2017). As rates continue to increase, more resea rch is necessary to explore the risk factors and predictors of suicide. Alcohol and marijuana use have been shown to be risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents (W M Felts et al1992), with alcohol use disorder also predicting suicide ideation in both men and women (Cottler, L. et al 2005).Thereis a lack of literature examining alcohol and marijuana use among adolescents hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) . This study examines the relationship between STBs and alcohol/marijuana usefor adolescent hospitalized and alcohol/ marijuana usefor adolescents hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Methods: 100 adolescents hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and behaviors completed a series of questionnaires and interviews as part of a larger R01 study (5R01MH105379 -03) examining the role of social context and gene tics in adolescent recovery. While onaninpatient unit, adolescents comple ted self-report questionnaires ,including the Adolescent Alcohol and Drug Involvement Scale (AADIS) and Adolescent Drinking Questionnaire (ADQ), andwere also administered the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) and Self-Injurious Thoughts and B ehaviors Interview (SITBI). Results: Correlation analyses showed a significant relationship between marijuana use and number of suicide attempts (R=.331, p=.003), aborted attempts (R=.353, p=.002), and interrupted attempts (R=.249, p=.040) made in the mo nth prior to hospitalization. A significant relationship was shown between lifetime passive suicide attempts and alcohol (R=.379, p=.029) and marijuana (R=.452, p=.008) use. Conclusions: Initial results suggest a link between marijuana use and higher rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in the month prior to an adolescent's psy chiatric hospitalization. Results suggest marijuana as a risk factor for STB. Implications for suicideprevention, intervention, and furtherresearch will be discussed.ABSTRACT #40 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Engraftment and Repopulation Potential of Late Gestation Fetal Rat Hepatocytes Authors Sanders, Jennifer, A. ;Boylan, Joan, M.

However, the application of this therapy has been hampered by identification of an appropriate cell population and limited understanding of the factors accounting for the abi lity of cells to repopulate injured liver. Goal/Objective: Our current studies are based on the hypothesis that histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) acting through effects on chromatin structure account for the fetal hepatocyte signaling pheno type and that this phenotype will result in a selective growth advantage for fetal cells in the injured adult liver microenvironment. Methods: Fetal hepatocytes were isolated using a monoclonal antibody against a hepatic surface protein, leucine amino pep tidase (LAP). LAP+ and LAP fractions were analyzed by immunofluorescence and microarray. Immunopurified E19 liver cells from DPPIV+ rats were transplanted via splenic injection into partial hepatectomized DPPIV rats that had been pretreated with mitomyci n C. Results:More than a third of LAP+ fetal hepatocytes expressed ductal markers. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that these dual -expressing cells represent a population of less well -differentiated hepatocytes. Upon transplantation, LAP+ late gestatio n fetal hepatocytes formed hepatic, endothelial, and ductal colonies within 1 month. By 10 months, colonies derived from LAP+ cells increased so that up to 35% of the liver was repopulated by donor -derived cells. We identified significant differences in 22 histoneposttranslational modifications .Among these was methylation of H3K27, H3K36, H4K20, and H3K9. Conclusions: Late gestation fetal hepatocytes, despite being far along in the differentiation process, possess the capacity for extensive liver repopulation. This is likely related to the unexpected presence of a significant proportion of hepatocyte marker -positive cells maintaining a less well -differentiated phenotype.ABSTRACT #5 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title THE BROWN UNIVERSITYTY GENOMICS CORE FACILITY -SUPPORTING RESEARCH IN THE OCEAN STATE Authors Schorl, C Department Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, BiochemistryDivision Bio-Med Hospital Brown University PI Click here to enter text.

Researchers have identified several distinct barriers to their recr uitment and retention as well as potential mitigating strategies. Previous research has emphasized recruitment and sampling rather than retention -specific challenges, and case reports in this field have favored randomized control trials (RCTs) or longitudi nal studies with short follow ups. Few have investigated time -intensive longitudinal studies, or studies involving both adolescents and families as participants. Goals:Identify socio -demographic predictors of retention and attrition in Project BEAR, a l ongitudinal study of adolescents and parents that involves multiple time -consuming follow -ups. Examine representativeness of the study population, potential retention barriers/mitigating strategies, and methods of collecting socio -demographic data. Methods:Parent socio -demographic data, including age, gender, household income, household size/number of children, marital status/household makeup, and race were collected from 105 participant families in Project BEAR, and analyzed using pearson correlation an d linear regression to identify potential predictors of retention rate for BEARs week 3 and month 6 follow -ups. Socio -demographic variables were also used to descriptively analyze the representativeness of the study population. Results: Preliminary resu lts indicate that low income is negatively correlated with retention at both the week 3 and the month 6 follow -up, with a stronger negative correlation demonstrated for the later follow -up. Further, descriptive statistics indicate that families of color ar e underrepresented in this study population. Conclusion: While none of the investigated socio -demographic variables were strong significant predictors of retention and attrition rate for Project BEAR, the correlation between low income and attrition merit s consideration. Further research is needed to investigate retention barriers specific to low -income families as well as different approaches to collecting socio -demographic data. Additional investigation into the lack of racial diversity within this research population is also advised.Graphical Abstract ABSTRACT #64 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Immunoglobulin A -Coated Bacteria Represent a Unique Subset of the Microbiome in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease Authors Shapiro, J., Clemente, J. ,Palm, N. ,De Zoete, M.,Flavell, R. ,Bright, R. ,Mallette, M. , Moniz, H. ,Amaral, K. ,Shah, S. ,LeLeiko, N. ,Sands, B.

P athogenesis has been attributed toa combination of genetic predisposition, alterations in the gut microbiome, defects in the mucosal immune system and various environmental exposures. Pilot data suggests that it is possible to identify pro - inflammatory bacterial taxa by assessing the de gree to which they are coated by secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA).The hypothesis of our current work is that bacteria enriched or depleted of secretory IgA represent a unique and clinically significant subset of the IBD microbiome. Methods Stool samples were obtained from the Ocean State Crohn's and Colitis Area Registry (OSCCAR), an inception cohort of 408patients with newly diagnosed IBD in Rhode Island. Taxa -specific IgA coating (IgA - Seq) from OSCCAR samples was measured via a combinatio n of antibody -based bacterial cell sorting and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing as previously described. Analyses of the resulting 16S rRNA data wasperformed using Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) 1.9.1, an open -source bioinformatics pipeline for performing analysis of microbiome sequence data . Results IgA-Seq and pre -IgA sorted 16S rRNA datasets were generated from 355 patient stool samples obtained at the time of OSCCAR study enrollment. Results were analyzed relative to patient phe notype, genotype, inflammatory burden and medication exposures. As OSCCAR is an observational cohort, many patients had already been exposed to immune modulating agents at the time of study enrollment, including systemic corticosteroids, thiopurine analogs and biologic agents that block tumor necrosis factor -TNF-), such as infliximab. We observe a number of bacterial taxa to be differentially enriched with secretory IgA in patients previously exposed to anti -TNF-agents. Interestingly, systemic corticosteroids had no observable effect on IgA -Seq. Previous work demonstrated high IgA -coating of B. fragilis in patients with newly diagnosed IBD. We observed a trend toward lower IgA coating and relative abundance of B.fragilis in patients exposed to TNF -inhibitors. Conclusions Preliminary results demonstrate that IgA -Seq identifies unique bacterial taxa across certain patient subgroups. An important finding is that IBD patients who were already exposed to TNF -inhibitors at the time of baseline stool collection harbored several taxa that were uniquely identified by IgA -Seq. These findings demonstra te that IgA -Seq can select for unique taxa that would have otherwise not been identified via examination of unsorted 16S rRNA relative abundance alone. Future work will examine the stability of these observations over time relative to changes in disease behavior and medication exposures by leveraging the longitudinally -collected stool samples from the OSCCAR cohort.ABSTRACT #36 25thAnnual Lifespan Research Celebration Day Department Hospital PI Anny Usheva Trainee YesXNo Level UndergraduateNew Investigator Yes NoX Highest Degree High School Funding NIH Citation for Publication; Please make a list of authors, one name per line Last name, Initials : Sriram, N Bilesimo, P Sellke, F Usheva, ATitle of Metabolic oftheCardiac Adaptation toMetabolic Syndrome Institutional affiliations: Rhode Island HospitalPig Model of Metabolic Syndrome Uncovers Cardiac Specific Effects on Glycolysis and Glycogen Accumulation Sriram N, Bilecimo P, Sellke FW, Usheva A Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Cardiovascular Research Center, Rhode Island Hospital, Alpert Medical School of Brown University Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a group of conditions including hypertension, hyperglycemia, low HDL levels, high triglyceride levels, and central obesity, that raises the risk of cardiovascular disease (CAD) , diabetes, and stroke. Due to the current obesity epidemic, MetS is prevalent in the U.S with about 34% of adults affected. Goal: To prevent said complications in such a large population alternative therapies for MetS are necessary . With th is in mind we aimed to better understand the metabolomic alterations in MetS and the effects of GSK -3b inhibition on chronic ischemic cardiac tissue. Method: We used a porcine model of diet -induced MetS and surgically -induced CA D. Cardiac tissue from Ossabaw and Yorkshire pigs was used for extraction of polar metabolites2,3. LC/MS - MS, non -negative data4and thin -layer chromatography (TLC) were used to verify the content of selected metabolites in cardiac tissue. Then, tissue lysates from pigs on lean diet (ND) ,pigs on hypercholesterolemic diet ( MetS )and GSK -3binhibitor treated MetS pigs were analyzed for phosphorylated g lycogen synthase 1 (P -GYS1) content by Western blotting with aP-GYS1 specific antibody. Fin ally, immunocytochemistry was used for glycogen staining of paraffin embedded cardiac tissue from ND, MetS and GSK -3b treated pigs. Results: 301 polar metabolites were identified by LC/MS -MS in the cardiac tissue. ND pigs showed higher content of metabolites from theglycolysis pathway and gluconeogenesis and increased glucose -6-phosphate, pyruvate and lactate levels vs Me tS pigs. These trends are supported by finding sthat several pathways are diminished in MetS vs ND. Additionally , P-GYS1 and glycogen content in cardiac tissues show scloser values in ND and GSK -3binhibitor treated MetS pigs than in MetS pigs sans treatment. Conclusions: NMF2classified the metabolomics mass -spec data into specific signatures clearly separating MetS from the ND control. Furthermore, glycolysis is suppressed in MetS as the cardiac content of entry metabolites, glucose -6-phosphate and fructose -6-phosphate, and final products, pyruvate and lactate, are significantly diminished. Finally, in MetS ,transcriptional GSK -3b activation leads to GYS1 inactivation and lessened glycogen. However, treatment of MetS pigs with GSK -3binhibitor r escues GYS1 and glycogen production, thus showing potential as an alternative treatment for MetS .Graphic 1: Swine Animal Model Graphic 2: Results ABSTRACT #32 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Comparative Analysis of a Novel Microbial Detection System and Gram Staining Utilizing Synovial Christopher, T.; Garcia, Dioscaris Department Orthopedics Division Biology and Medicine Hospital Rhode Island Hospital PI Christopher T.

Diagnostic methods, including cu lturing, PCR, and gram staining, continue to encounter issues of speed, accuracy, and reliability. This challenge isthe focus of a novel fluorescent -antibody based assay utilizing confocal laser scanning microscopy and synovial fluid. Objective: This study aims to create a quicker, more reliable, and accessible way to detect and visualize infections as well as to differentiate gram stain designation and morphology. Materials and Methods: Through an IRB approved protocol, samples were coll ected and stored in 10% neutral-buffered formalin at room temperature from orthopaedic surgeons at the Rhode Island Hospital. 20 \u00b5L sampleswere methanol -fixed onto slides andstained with serums, using fluorescent conjugated antibodies againstlipoteichoic acid and lipopolysaccharides. Images obtained through confocal l aser scanning microscopy were analyzed using ImageJ (NIH) and compared to gram staining and clinical laboratory data. Results:Through a blind, preliminary pilot study , the assay, gram staining, and hospital data trials have agreed that 7.7% (1 out of 13) of samples tested contained bacteria, while 92.7% (12 out 13) were deemed \"not infected.\" In cases of infection in synovial fluid with metallosis or high concentration of blood, the assay was able to distinguish infection from particles and erythrocytes in the fluid. Conclusions :The ability of the rapid visualization assay to effectively identify the presence of bacteria in synovial fluid (regardless of turbidity) repr esents a major step forward in the development and validation of this assay technique. Such improvements could provide surgeons with the tools to properly assess for infection and determine the proper antibiotic regimen for management. While both were foun d to be successful at visualizing bacteria, multiple potential advantages in terms of speed, accuracy, clarity, and cost were found when using the assay.ABSTRACT #52 25th Annual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title ASPH phosphorylation \u2014Role B.; de la Monte, S.M.

From the Departments of Pathology, Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital and the Alpert Medical School of Brown University; MPPB Graduate Program of Brown University, Providence, RI. Background : Previous studies demonstrated that Aspartyl -asparaginyl --hydroxylase (ASPH), a microsomal enzyme is expressed on the cell surfaces of malignant neoplastic cell s and immature cells. ASPH has a demonstrated role in regulating cell motility and invasion via its interactions with and activation of Notch and its ligand Jagged. In addition, ASPH signals through HIF -1alpha. Mechanistically, it was demonstrated that che mical or molecular inhibition of GSK -3 resulted in increased levels of ASPH protein, but not its mRNA, and functionally, cells were rendered more motile. Correspondingly , increased levels of GSK -3, as occur with chronic ethanol exposures, inhi bit ASPH protein expression and cell motility. Importantly, in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, reduced neuronal migration is associated with high levels of GSK -3 activity and reduced lev els of ASPH protein expression. These findings, together with evidence that ASPH exhibits Western blot motility at ~140 kD instead of its predicted ~86 kD size, led to subsequent questions about the role of phosphorylation as a regulato r of ASPH protein expression and function. Methods: Subsequence analysis of ASPH protein demonstrated multiple predicted phosphorylation sites, most of which corresponded to the GSK -3 consensus sequence. Site -directed mutagenesis was used to generate single and multiple point mutations in GSK -3 and other phosphorylation sites. Human central nervous system (CNS) derived PNET 2 cells were transiently transfected with wildtype and mutant cDNA constructs that had either a Myc or HA fusion tag to distinguish endogen ous from exogen ously expressed proteins. PNET2 cells were used because their endogenous levels of ASPH expression were very low, enabling analysis of the e ffects of phosphorylation on ASPH protein expression and Results: and WT ASPH significantly increased PNET2 cell motility and ASPH 's catalytic activity linked to Notch activation. Selective deletion of GSK -3 phosphorylatio n sites on ASPH, further enhanced ASPH -mediated PNET2 motility and Notch pathway signaling, including via Hes gene expression. In some instances, m ultiple point mutations in GSK -3b sites further enhanced PNET2 motility and catalytic activity. Fina lly, the inhibitory effects of ethanol on PNET2 expression were partly abrogated by mutagenesis of GSK -3 phosphorylation sites. Conclusions: These studies demonstrate that ASPH can be directly phosphorylated by GSK3 and that inhibition of GSK -3 phosphorylation of ASPH protein increases ASPH protein expression, catalytic activity, and Notch -activated signaling. The findings suggest that inhibition of ASPH phosphorylation in the brain may help to resolve ethanol 's inhibitory effects on neuronal migration in fetal alcohol spectru m disorder.

A promising avenue of treatment is cell -based therapies that induce healing and restore native tissue function. However, studies using bone marrow -derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM -MSC's) for this purpose have resulted in repair tissue hypertrophy. Our lab focuses on using progenitor cells for meniscus repair. We have recently identified a of CD49e+/CD90 -/CD5 4+/CD166+ cartilage -derived chondroprogenitor cells (CPs). In this study, we evaluated their repair response in a torn rat meniscus model. Goal: Determine whether CPs induce a better repair response in a torn rat meniscus model, relative to BM -MSCs. Methods: Human CPs were using differential adhesion fibronectin. CP lines and MSCs were subjected to chondrogenic and osteogenic conditions in vitro . Cells were stained with 0.2% Alcian blue to measure proteoglycan production and stained with 2.0 % Alizarin Red to stain for mineralization. Master chondrogenesis regulator SOX -9 and hypertrophy marker Collagen X (COL10A1) mRNA levels by RT -PCR. Results: Basal SOX -9, COL10A1 expression was primary chondro cytes, and BM -MSCs. All CP of COL10A1, relative to BM -MSCs. CP line 3 had the highest SOX -9 expression and the lowest COL10A1 expression of all lines. CP line 3 also had the most proteoglycan production compared to BM -MSCs and another CP line (A1). These findings suggest that certain cartilage -derived CP subsets exhibit high chondrogenic potential with reduced osteogenic potential. We evaluated repair capacity using a rat meniscal tear model, ex-vivo. Human CPs progressi vely filled in the meniscal tear, generating new tissue that bridged the entire gap within 20 days after treatment. Gene expression analysis revealed the CP treated menisci had decreased COL10A1 expression compared to BM -MSC treated menisci. Conclusion: This study shows for the first time that healthy human cartilage contains progenitor cells capable of promoting meniscal tissue repair and resisting cellular hypertrophy in an ex-vivo organ culture model. Our results strongly suggest that specific subsets of CPs may be promising alternatives to BM -MSCs, and are therefore ideal for usage in cell -based meniscal repair.ABSTRACT # 41 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Textured Image Analysis of Hepatic Shear Wave Elastography Imagery via Pyradiomics Beland, Michael; Merck, Lisa; Merck, Derek Department Diagnostic Imaging Division Click here to enter text.

However, invasive liver biospy remains the standard for liver fibrosis staging because SWE fails to detect subtle differences between early stages of liver fibrosis. Goal/Objective: We prop ose the extraction of additional features from ultrasound imagery will improve the assessment of fibrosis staging. Methods and Materials: We obtained data from patients who received a hepatic ultrasonography and a random liver biopsy on the same day. Ten e lastogram measurements were obtained for each patient, with regions of interest (ROI) 1 cm below liver capsule and 5 cm from skin surface. Textured analysis features such as variance, uniformity, kurtosis, sphericity, and flatness were obtained using ope n-source Pyradiomics package. The patients were then divided by stage fibrosis (Metavir scale 0 -4) to compare textured analysis metrics. Results: We identified 50 patients who received both hepatic ultrasonography and liver biopsy (n=10 per Metavir fibrosi s stage). On univariate analysis, cluster shade was statistically significant between fibrosis stages (stage I: showed diffe rence between fibrosis stages 1 and 2 (p=0.03), between stages 1 and 3 (p=0.02) between stages 2 and 3 (p=0.04). Conclusion: Feature extraction via Pyradiomics detects subtle differences between early stages of hepatic fibrosis (1 -3), whereas SWE can dete ct later stages of fibrosis. A larger clinical trial is needed to investigate the impact of Pyradiomics feature extraction.ABSTRACT #55 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Neighborhood Risk Factors for Pediatric Fall -related Injuries: A Retrospective Analysis of a State -Wide Hospital Veras, Yokarla; Department Hassenfeld Child Health Innovation Institute, Brown UniversityDivision Click here to enter text.

Background: Falls represent the leading cause of unintentional nonfatal injuries in children resulting in substantial costs and morbidity. There is a paucity of literature examining neighborhood factors associated with increased risk of fall -related injuries. This study examined the burden of pediatric falls and the association of neig hborhood attributes with rates of fall-related injuries. Methods: This is a retrospective observational study of children 17 years old who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) within a state -wide hospital network for fall -related injuries betwee n 2005 -2014. Patient s'addresses were geocoded using ArcView Geographic Information System (GIS) software and assigned to corresponding census block groups. Census population data was used to characterize block groups by measures of poverty and factors previously associated with unintentional childhood injury. We computed quintiles for each measure and summed these to create an index. We then computed quintiles for the index (higher quintiles signify increased risk). Public outdoor recreational faciliti esin each block group were enumerated. We used linear regression to model average annual fall rates of block groups, adjusting for neighborhood quintile and presence of public outdoor recreational facilities. Results: Out of 137,737 unintentional pedia tric injuries presenting to the ED during the 10 -year study period, 42,382 (30%) were for fall -related injuries. Of those with fall -related injuries, 58% were male, 40% were 1 -4 years old, 59% were non - Hispanic white, and 52% used public insurance as their source of payment. Multivariable linear regression analysis demonstrated that increases in neighborhood quintile had greater average annual fall rates (Quintile 1 vs 2 = 0.43; CI 0.19-0.66, Quintile 1 vs 3 = 0.83; CI 0.59 -1.08, Quintile 1 vs 4 = 1.0 8; CI 0.82 -1.34, Quintile 1 vs 5 = 1.53; CI 1.25-1.80). Having at least 1 or more public outdoor recreational facilities wasnot associated with greater average annual fall rates ( = 0.01; CI -0.14-0.15). Conclusion: Children living in concentrated areas of poverty and higher measures of variables previously associated with childhood unintentional injuries experience falls at higher rates than other neighborhoods. Understanding neighborhood risks for falls provides insi ght for the development of effective fall injury prevention programs.ABSTRACT #38 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title SHP2 Regulates the Osteogenic Fate of Growth Plate Hypertrophic Chondrocytes Wang, J.; Chen, D.; Warman, M.L.; Ehrlich, M.G.; Yang, W.

Orthopaedic Research Laboratories and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115 Background Transdifferentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes i nto bone -forming osteoblasts has been reported, yet the underlying molecular mechanism remains incompletely understood. SHP2 is an ubiquitously expressed chondroid cells are linke d to metachondromatosis in humans and mice, suggesting a crucial role for SHP2 in the skeleton. However, the specific role of SHP2 in skeletal cells has not been elucidated. Goal/Objective We would like to investigate the role of SHP2 in cartilage development. Methods \"Cre-loxP\" -mediated gene excision were used to ablate SHP2 in collagen 21(Col21) -Cre- and Rosa26mTm Gor Rosa26ZsGand Sp7 -mCherr y mice were bred to these compound mice as reporters for in vivo cell lineage tracing. X-ray and CT were used to skeletal morphology. Western blot analysis was used to measure protein expression, modification and interaction. Histological and immunohistol ogical staining and in situ hybridization were used to visualize tissue micro -architecture as well as the expression of key chondrocytic and osteogenic marker gene expression. Results SHP2 was inducibly deleted in COL21+ cells in Ptpn11fl/fl;Col2 1CreER mice on post -natal days 21 cause the mice to exhibit dwarfism, cartilaginous exostoses and chondrodysplasia with elongated growth plate cartilage , compared to the controls . In contrast, the Ptpn11fl/fl;Col10 1Cre mice appeared normal at birth but ha d reduced bone mineral density at adulthood. At the cellular level, lineage tracing studies revealed a marked reduction of GFP+ cells in the metaphyseal trabecular bone of the Ptpn11fl/fl;Col10 1Cre;Rosa26mTmGmice. Taken together, this suggests that SHP2 deletion in hypertrophic chondrocytes compromised their transdifferentiation into bone -forming osteoblasts. Subsequent in situ hybridization data was supportive, revealing relative abundance of chondrocytic marker ( Acan, Col2 the metaphyseal bone of the mutants. As an aside, in vitro mechanistic studies have revealed that SHP2 is a key regulator of SOX9 in hypertrophic c hondrocytes and that the osteogenic transdifferentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes (data not included). Conclusions Our data reveals an important regulatory role for SHP2 in the trans differentia tion of ossification.ABSTRACT #63 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Reversal of aplastic anemia by mesenchymal stem cell P.

Aplastic anemia remains a challenging disease as far as etiology and therapeutic approaches. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been found to deliver both mRNA and transcriptional modulators to target cells and affect their phenotype .Our recent published work has shown that human o r murine mesenchymal stem cells (MSC ) derived EV treatment dramatically reversed radiation damage to bone barrow both in vitro and in vivo by inhibition of DNA damage and apoptosis . In this study, we evaluate dwhether human MSC -EVs could reverse marrow failure in a Busulfan induced aplastic anemia mouse model. We have carried out studies on Busulfan (BU) induced marrow aplasia byadministered Busulfan in doses of 9.25 mg/kg intraperitoneally (9 times over 20 days) to induce bone marrow aplasia in female B alb/cByJ mice .Mice were then infused with 4x108human MSC -EVs at 1, 2 and 3 days after final BU dose. We observed that the human MSC EVs treatment significantly prolonged survival in these mice. 50% of BU treated mince died by 30 days after BU injection, whereas only 30% of EVs - injected mice did so by this time . The mice were sacrificed to harvest bone marrow cell s(WBM Cs)and peripheral blood for cell count at 10 days after final BU dose. There were significant decreases in WBM Cs counts from tibia and fe mur and complete blood count (CBC) including RBC, WBC, HBG and PLT in BU treated mice compared to vehicle control mice. The vesicle treatment led to a statistically significant (p<0.05) increase in WBMCs count with the average of 3.30\u00b10.46 x106cells /tibi a and femur for the vesicle treated mice compared to 2.05\u00b10.46 x 106cells for the non -vesicle treated mice. The restoration growth of bone marrow stem cells was further confirmed by WBM Csculture .We further investigated the effect of MSC -EVs on the micro RNA expression in WBMCs from BU induced aplastic anemia mice by microRNA realtime PCR array .151microRNAs were altered by Busulfan treated ,88showed partial or complete reversal of these alterations after EV treatment. In summary, our data suggested that MSC -EV treatment could partially reverse Busulfan induced marrow failure at early time points . The reversal of the Busultan induced chronic bone marrow failure by MSC -EVs need further investigate.ABSTRACT #49 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Effect of parent -child differences in emotion regulation on suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

Institutional affiliations 1RhodeIsland Hospital , Department of Psychiatry, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI; 2Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Brown Medical School, Providence, RI 3 University of Rhode Island, Department of Psychology, Kingston, RIBackground: Adolescent suicide is a major public health threat in the in United States. It is the second leading cause of death fo r youth between the ages 10 -24,(CDC, 2014). Risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors include emotion dysregulation and family conflict (Berona 2017, Withers 1987). Past research has examined aspects of the parent -child relationship as predictors of future suicidal behavior .The purpose of the study is to examine diff erences in emotion reg ulation between parents and psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents . Methods: As part of a larger study (R01: 5R01MH105379 ), adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 who were hospitalized psychiatrically completed self -report questionnaires (N = 86) . In order to be included in the study, adolescents must have endorsed suicidal ideation with in the past month. Parents also completed self -report questionnaires while their child was in the hospital. Both parents and adolescents completed the Difficultie s in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), measuring emotion dysregulation and Implicit Theories of Emotion Scale (IES). Paired samples t -tests were used to compare mean differences in emotion regulation between parents and adolescents. Results: Findings indicated that adolescents ( M= (t(85) = 10.956, p< .001) .Adolescents also scored higher on the IES for beliefs about themselves ( M= significant level (t(85) = 8.144, p< .001). The same held true for beliefs relating to others, with adolescents ( M= 20.70, SD= 5.94) scoring significantly higher SD= 5.16), (t(85) = 4.319, p< .001). Conclusion: These finding indicate that parents and psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents differ in their emotion regulation and implicit beliefs regarding emotions. The associations between differences i n parent and adolescent emotion regulation and suicidal thoughts and behaviors are discussed .Further data collection and a larger sample size is needed to confirm findings.ABSTRACT #26 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title The Role Of Vinculin In Neutrophil 2 Integrin .

Understanding how neutrophils migrate is critical for regulating excessive inflammation and subsequent collateral injury. 2 integrins are essential to most neutrophil recruitment from the blood, and the activation of 2 integrins from an inactive to an active, extended state for capture on the endothelial wall has been well defined in previous studies. The importance of adhesion stabilization as the neutrophil is halted on the endothelial surface and crawls into a favorable position for transmigration is less defined. Neutrophils do not make mat ure focal adhesions, but do express the major focal adhesion protein vinculin. Vinculin associates with integrins by binding to the talin -1 rod domain and stabilizes integrin adhesions by recruiting various actin -associated proteins or by associating with actin directly.Goal/Objective: In this study, we use in vitro -derived and genetically modified neutrophils to determine the role of integrin function in vinculin knockout neutrophils .Results:On ICAM-1/CXCL1 coated surfaces, we find neutrophils are significantly less adherent after CRISPR -Cas9 mediat ed knockout of vinculin. Neutrophil 2 integrin -dependent crawling on coated glass is significantly reduced by knockout of vinculin. Neutrophil spreading frequency is also significantly attenuated by vinculin knockout on coated glass and on coated polyacry lamide gels of high physiological stiffness. Using traction it is evident that 2 integrin -dependent contractile strength of neutrophils is attenuated after vinculin knockout. However, vinculin is not required for activation of 2 integri ns as stimulated vinculin knockout neutrophils bind soluble ICAM -1 as effectively as wild -type controls. Also, vinculin knockout neutrophils show no significant defect in crawling after perfusion in coated flow chambers with E -selectin-dependent capture. Conclusions: We conclude that vinculin plays a role in 2 integrin stabilization to promote motility in 2D on glass, but in a physiological system with lower matrix stiffness or shear stress this might be dispensable.ABSTRACT #28 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Mechanosensing of Human Neutrophils Controls Effector Responses Christian; and Reichner , Jonathan S.

Once out of the blood vessels, neutrophils utilize chemotactic gradients to directionally migrate precisely to the site of tissue injury or infection. In so doing, the neutrophils navigate through a three -dimensional tissue microenvironment that is densely packed with parenchymal cells and extracellular matrix. The physical property of confinement is sensed by cells as a regulatory element as it pertains to motility. While flat 2D tissue culture surfaces have been used historically to study many key antimicrobial effector functions of neutrophils such as generation of oxidative radicals, release of cytokines, phagocytosis , and release of extracellular traps, these fail to mimic not only the confinement of peripheral tissue, but also the elasticity of it. Objective: While tissue culture surfaces are inflexible and rigid, bodily tissues are pliable and elastic with the brain being relatively soft (~1 kPa) and organs (~10 kPa) and muscle (~20kPa) being stiff by comparison. Although confinement and elasticity are physical properties of the tissue microenvironment that have significant effects on neutrophil migration and tracti on force generation, these properties also regulate antimicrobial effector functions of neutrophils . Methods: Systemic fungal infections such as those caused by Candida sp. are particularly problematic in patients maintained in the surgical ICU for extended periods of time. Invasive measures such as intravenous catheters and hyperalimentation contribute to therisk of acquiring c andidiasis. Because n eutrophils are the primary line of host defense against tissue infection with Candida , we used Candida hyphae and immobilized beta-glucan to as our disease model. These were then coated on gels of stiffness ranging from 1 to 50 kPa. Results: Clustering and NETosis proved es sential for immune elimination of Candida not only in the previous tissue culture system, but also in the use of tunable elasticity gels. Further, clustering took far longer to occur on soft substrates as opposed to stiffer ones, which is line with previou s findings that neutrophils lose directionality on softer gels. NETosis foci were also mechanosensitive. While NETs foci were more numerous but small on soft substrates, foci were small in number but stronger in fluorescence on stiffer substrates. Therefor e, in this study, we further characterized the mechanosensitivity and integrin -dependence of neutrophil anti -fungal responses in a microenvironment that mimics native tissue. Conclusions: Understanding the mechanosensitive mechanisms underlying chemo taxis, aggregation, and NETosis in the neutrophil anti -fungal response may provide therapeutic targets to benefit candidiasis patients in the future by reducing harmful neutrophil behaviors and/or stimulating behaviors crucial to fungal clearance.ABSTRACT #57 25th Annual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Title Improving the quality of patient communication and care delivery using the after-visit-summary Authors Vivian Wong MD-PhD and SoYeon Paek MD Department Hospital Rhode Island Hospital PI SoYeon Paek Trainee Yes x No Level PGY4 New Investigator Yes x No Highest Degree MD PhD Funding None Citation for Publication; Please make a list of authors, one name per line Wong, V.

Title of Abstract Improving the quality of patient communication and care delivery using the after-visit-summary Institutional affiliations Department of Dermatology, Brown University/Lifespan Improving the quality of patient communication and care delivery using the after-visit-summary Vivian Wong, MD-PhD and So Yeon Paek, MD Department of Dermatology, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University; Rhode Island Hospital/Lifespan Introduction: With electronic medical records, patients can be provided printed clinical summaries of their visits known as the \"after-visit-summary (AVS)\". Studies in other specialties have shown that the AVS provides an opportunity for providers to add pertinent health care information in a standardized yet personalized manner. In the United States, the AVS is considered a meaningful use criterion, which is a measure for physicians to qualify for an incentive payment through the government payment systems. While many primary care physicians have adopted AVSs in their routine clinical setting, it remains unclear if providing AVS is an effective tool for patient communication in the dermatology setting. Material/methods: Questionnaires were sent to dermatology providers regarding their preferences on patient communication. Per IRB approval, patients were recruited from our clinics, and questionnaires were provided to the subjects and their dermatologists regarding their perspectives on various methods of patient communication. A chart review was performed to characterize patient compliance, outcome and tendency to keep follow up appointments. Results: A total of 65 dermatology providers were surveyed (attending physicians, n=50, resident physicians, n=7, and physician extenders, n=9) on their preference on patient communication. Only 27% of respondents were aware that AVS is a meaningful use criterion. While a majority of respondents agreed that written or printed instructions were helpful tools for patient communication, only 66% of respondents regularly did so. Among those, only 27% utilized AVS as a form of communication, many attributing to a lack of time and access to an electronic medical record system. We surveyed 17 patients seen in our dermatology clinics and evaluated their clinical experience with AVS. Many patients found both the printed AVS and verbal instructions to be useful in the dermatology clinic setting. Compliance with prescription pick up, laboratory testing and follow-up appointments was high. Conclusions: This study highlights the utility of AVS for dermatologists to improve patient care. However, as verbal communication remains a critical venue for patient communication, the AVS should not be used in place of it. We will continue to implement printed clinical summaries in our dermatology clinics to improve care delivery.

To better understand the nature, pathogenesis, progression, and reversibility of alcohol -induced WM degeneration, additional technically feasible approaches are needed to characterize pathological alterations in WM myelin. Goal/Objective: This study was designed to examine the degrees to which progressive ethanol exposures and short-term recovery alter white matter myelin lipid composition and abundance using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization -imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI -IMS). with isocaloric liquid diets containing 0% or 26% ethanol by caloric content (0 or 6% v/v) for 3 or 8 weeks. Ethanol fed rats were also administered intraperitoneal injections of 2 g/kg of ethanol on Monda ys, Wednesdays, and Fridays during the last two weeks, while controls were treated with saline. To examine withdrawal effects, following 6 -weeks of ethanol exposure, the 26% ethanol containing diets were tapered to 0% over three days and i.p. binging was discontinued for the final 2 weeks of the experiment. After harvest, frozen brain sections (8 M) were mounted onto indium tin oxide coated conductive glass slides and coated with matrix (2,5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid) by sublimation. Lipids were analyzed with MALDI-TOF in negative ion mode and stained with Luxol fast blue-H&E. Results:Histopathological examination revealed ethanol -associated reductions in myelin staining intensity and thickness of the corpus callosum. Recovery from the ethanol exposures result ed in reversal of the white matter atrophy and myelin pallor. MALDI -IMS demonstrated striking ethanol -associated alterations in white matter lipid profiles characterized by decreases in most phospholipids (phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidylserines, phosph atidylcholines, of ethanol's effects with recovery. The heatmap hierarchical dendrogram and PCA distinguished ethanol exposure, duration, and withdrawal effects on WM lipid profiles. Conclusions: Ethanol's inhibitory effects on white matter lipids were proportional with duration of exposure and these adverse effects were partially reversible by short term ethanol withdrawal. These findings reveal lipid biochemical abnormaliti es underlying ethanol induced white matter degeneration.ABSTRACT #20 25thAnnual Lifespan Hospitals Research Celebration Day Nitrosamine Ketone (NNK) Distorts Alcohol Metabolizing Enzyme Activities in Favor of Acetaldehyde Accumulation in Rat Liver and Brain Authors Yalcin, Emine, B.; Tong, Ming; de la Monte, Suzanne, M.

These findings suggest that tissue injury is not caused by ethanol alone, and instead may be partly due to one of its toxic metabolites. Goal/Objective: This study examined t he activity levels of major enzymes that metabolize ethanol, including ADH, ALDH and catalase, in experimental rat models that cause steatohepatitis in liver and white matter degeneration in brain. Methods: Long Evans rats were pair -fed liquid diets conta ining 0% or 26% ethanol by content for 8 weeks. Rats were administered intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of saline or ethanol (2 g/kg;3 times/week ) during Weeks 7 -8. The control and ethanol -exposed rats were each subdivided and ip injected with saline or NNK(2 mg/kg; 3x/week) in weeks 3 -8. Freshly harvested livers and frontal lobes were snap -frozen and stored at-80C. ADH, catalase and ALDH activities were measured using commercial kits. CYP450 mRNA levels (17 isoforms) were measured in liver by qRT-PCR analysis. Malondialdehyde immunoreactivity was measured by duplex ELISAs. liver, ethanol i ncreased hepatic ADH ( P=0.04) but not catalase or ALDH. Although NNK alone had no effect on ADH, ALDH, or catalase, ethanol+NNK increased hepatic ADH above the levels measured in all othergroups (P=0.0001) .Ethanol+NNK also increased malondialdehyde adduct formation in the liver (P=0.03). QRT-PCR analysis of liver demonstrated that ethanol increased mRNAs (P<0.03) and NNK increased CYP2B1 (P<0.06) and (P<0.03). In brain, dual exposures to ethanol and NNK significantly increased frontal lobe ADH (P=0.01) and ALDH (P=0.02)activity relative to control. Ethanol inhibited CYP1A1 mRNA expression relative to contr ol (P=0.02); while combined exposures inhibited expression of CYP1A1 (P=0.01) and CYP2C6 (P=0.03) to lower levels. Ethanol and/or NN K exposures had no effect on malondialdehyde -protein expression in thefrontal lobe. Conclusions: Combined exposures to ethanol and NNK increase hepatic and brain ethanol metabolism favoring acetaldehyde accumulation and tissue injury. Ethanol and/or NNK exposures alter the expression of CYP450 isoforms that are utilized in NNK, fatty acid, and xenobio tic metabolism.Research Resources Lifespan Core Facilities: de la Monte -Director 1 Cores RI.org Lifespan and Brown University teamed up to develop the CoresRI.org website (http://www.coresri.org/facilities ) which lists all core facilities available at both institutions, as well as at Women and Infants Hospital of RI, the Providence VA Medical Center, Roger Williams Medical Center, University of Rhode Island, Marine Biological Laboratories, Providence College, Rhod e Island College, Community College of Rhode Island, and several other smaller institutions .

CLINICAL TRIALS SITES The Clinical R esearch Center aims to provide flexible high quality resources to support translational research for investigators to carry \"bedside to community\" research studies. Our overall goal is to eliminate the logistical obstacles that may prevent researchers from pursuing clinic al trials and other biomedical research st udies and to provide encouragement and additional resources for established clinical res earch teams. We also hope to support investigators as they launch multi-center trials and other research initiatives. The ambulatory Clinical R e- search Center occupies 2,617 square feet in the Coro Research Building in Providence. The Unit includes five multi-purpose and adaptable examination rooms, all of which can be staged to suit a specific clinical study. A second research center is loc ated at 1125 North Main Street, near The Miriam Hospital campus. This unit includes six examination rooms. Both units have access to a central s pecimen processing lab. 2. RESEARCH CONSULTATION, STUDY PROTOCOL DESIGN, IRB, DATA ANALYSIS; GRANT AND MEDICAL WRITING Planning Your Research: The CRC can provide high quality assistance with clinical trial design, including final sculpting of specific aims and hypotheses, measurement selection, power analysis, data analysis planning, and grant/proposal preparation. Starting Your Clinical Trial Resea rch: The CRC can provide assistance with the constructi on of RED Cap data collection tools, databases, and data management protocols, and help with special technological needs, such as purchasing nonstandard equipment. Support Throughout the Clinical Trial: The CRC can offer decision-making support, and help to assess the impact of potential design modifications on final statistical inference. Mem bers of the CRC can serve on, or help identify appropriate in dividuals to serve on data and safety monitoring boards (DSMB). Data Acquisition , Processin g, a n d Analysis Support: The Biostatistics Core at Rhode Island Hospital is an integral component of the CRC. The Biostatistics c ore can provide centralized biostatistics consultation services and tailored guid-ance to investigators on the broad array of resources available and suitable for their research. Prepar ing Data for Analysis at Conclusion of the Trial : The CRC can assist with implementation of the data analysis plan, either by providing access to contemporary statistical analysis s oftware and coaching, or by condu cting analyses for or with investigators. Lifespan CRC Lifespan CRC Lifespan CRC Lifespan CRC Publications: A major end-point of clinical res earch is to disseminate the new information clearly and efficiently. The CRC can assist with manuscript preparation/writing, editing, data visualization, data interpretation, and integration of findings wit hin the broader context of the project. The CRC and also help investigators respond to manuscript critiques. Institut ional Review Board (IRB ): All clinic al studies and trials re quire IRB approval. Successful completion of the paperwork and queries pertaining to each protocol can be difficult to navigate, particularly for those who are new to clinical re search. The CRC can provide guidance on how to write and assemble an IRB application. Grant and Medical Writing: One of the most difficult challenges for many investigators is sci entific, medical, and grant writing. Our experienced team of writers can help with scientific concepts and clarity of expressio n. We can provide assistance with grammar, spelling, word usage, and sentence/paragraph structure. Gra nt writing is expected to be innovative, hypothesis-driven, and based on preliminary results. Due to the complexity of medical and scientific writing, we provide technical r eaders as well as professional interpreters of results. 3. BIOBANKING AND SPE CIMEN PROCESSING Specimen Processing : Specimen processing is available for all types of specimens, incl uding but not limited to Blood, Urine, Stool, CSF, Semen, Saliva, Cervical V aginal Lavages, Dried blood spots, and TearFlo Strips.

SPECIALIZED INSTRUMENTATION Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT Plus ) with Blue P eak auto fluore scence and Nsi te Analytics SPECTRAL IS OCT Plus Blu ePeak and Nsite Analytics is an FDA- approved (noninvasive, minimal risk) dia gnostic device for imaging and measuring structure of the human retina. The device is combination of a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope and a spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). The confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO) part of the device allow acquiring reflectance images (with blue or infrared light), and autofluorescence images (BluePeak auto fluorescence). The spectral-doma in optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) part of the device allows acquiring cross-sectional and volume images. The different imaging modes can be used either alone or simultaneously; all imaging modes provide three-dimensional resolution, high frame rate and high image contrast and quality. A real-time eye tracking sys tem link the cSLO and SD-OCT portions of the devices, and allows positioning and stabilizing of the OCT scan on the retina. The SPECTRALIS Nsite Analytics s oftware is dedicated to visualize and quantify retinal structures that experience changes in neurodegenerative disease. AngioVue: Dual -modality OCT System Optovue's AntioVue Enhanced Microvascular Imaging is the only commercially available OCTA system capable of imaging both structure (OCT) and function (OCTA) in a fast, simple and repeatable non -invasive procedure. Angiovue images and displays different layers within the retina without requiring a contrast dye injection, unlike fluorescein angiography (FA). In only a few seconds, Oct -angio graphy with AngioVue allows visualization and assessment of microvasculature with the retina in automatically segmented layers of interest. AngioVue OCTA scanning can be repeated safely as often as needed to provide the clinical information desired, withou t the obscuring effects of pooling and staining common in FA or other contrast ative computed tomography (pQCT ) pQCT is used to mineral density with a standard X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) sca nner along with a calibration standard. The goal is to convert Ho unsfield Units (HU) obtained with the CT image, to bone mineral density values. Quantitative CT sc ans are mainly used to assess bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and hip, but it has been utilized for a much broader range of testing. Lifespan CRC During CT image acquisition, solid phantoms are inserted in a pad under the subject for calibration. The phantoms contain materials that different equivalent bone mineral densities. Calcium H ydroxyapatite (CaHA P) or Potassium Phosphate (K2HPO 4) is used as the reference standard. Diagnostic uses of pQCT include diagnosis and monitoring of osteoporosis, measuring lumbar spine bone mineral density, aerial bone mineral density measureme nts and T- Scores that are equivalent of DXA measurements without the need for precise patient positioning and in the presence of scoliosis. Heidelberg Spect ralis and Edge Perimetery Heidelberg Edge Perimeter (HEP) is a monitor-based perimeter designed to test central and peripheral vision. It offers a full set of standard tests for the central 10, 24, and 30 visual field as well as an extension to the periphery up to 60. HEP employs traditional visual field measurement techniques such as Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP), along with a unique ne visual function- specific stimulus called Flicker-Defined Form (FDF). These tests enable comprehensive functional testing of the visual system. The FDF Perimetry should be considered for screening and subject who may be suspected of having subclinical visual loss. Neurotrack's Visual Paired -Comparison Task (VPC) . The VPC task records eye tracking data while the subject views a series of paired images; differences in viewing behavior for the familiar v ersus novel images are analyzed by software to determine risk of medial temporal lobe impairment. This is the panda pic. Transc ranial Magnet ic Stimula tion The NeuroStar TMS Therapy uses a highly focused pulsed magnetic field, similar in type and strength to those produced by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine, to stimulate cortical neuron. The TMS processes includes precise pulsed magnetic field that induce small electric currents in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Local neurons depolarize, which leads to activation of deep brain structures via trans-synaptic pathways. Activation of these pathways in the limbic system leads to the release of neurotransmitters. Blood flow and glucose metabolize rise in the activated region which is thought to result in improved mood. TMS measures are extremely favorable as compared with other behavioral and neuroimaging methods as they are non- invasive, short, painless, repeatable and it do not depend on factors su ch as motivation, attention, or cognitive ability that typically limit other diagnostic tests and interventions only to high-functioning or older children. However, the CRC Lifespan CRC has a TMS chair that can be used in pediatric research, including for the study of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Major Depression Disorder.

We are located on the sixth floor of the Aldrich Building. The 1250 square foot Molecular Pathology facility is equipped with the following instrumentation: Aperio ScanScope Slide Scanner: The ScanScope\u00ae is an instrument capable of generating full color, high resolution digital images of cells, tissues and tissue arrays that can be an alyzed using sophisticated image analysis softwa re or stored and catalogued as a searchable image data base. This scanner will help our pa thologists and scientists to determine the unique characteristics of cancerous tissue. Image Analysis in the Molecular Pathology Core: Image analysis is the extraction of useful information from images by means of digital image procession techniques. In our lab we use computerized morphometry of microscopic images collected from experimental animals and human tissues or cells. Additional applications include quantification of various biological markers in immunohistochemically stained tumor cells (biopsies, tissue microarrays). Immunohistoche mistry Spec ialty Testing: The Molecular Core laboratory's Ventana Discovery is a totally automated staining module that uses bar code technology. The Discoveryoffers walk-away automation, reliable reproducibility, flexibility and data management, as well as total automation in the areas of IHC staining of frozen or paraffin embedded sections of animal or human tissue, FISH and ISH using DNA, RNA or oligonucleotide probes on sections or microarrays (gene expression). Laser Capture Microdissection: LCM offers a method for procuring pure cells from specific microscopic regions of tissue sections and which allows the application of molecular analysis methods to study evolving disease lesions in actual tissue. Our new ArcturusXT system from MDS Analytical Technologies is a unique microdissection instrument that combines Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) and Ultraviolet (UV) Laser Cutting in one platform. Quantitative Real-Time PCR by Mx3005p from Agilent Techno logies: is a highly sensitive and specific fluorescence-based technique that measures the production of a target amplicon during the exponential phase of the polymerase chain reaction when PCR efficiency is least influenced by reaction variables. Tissue Microarray Production: The Beecher Tissue Microarrayer generates multiple specimen slides that can contain hundreds of individual tissues. An array is constructed by inserting 0.6-2.0 mm plugs removed from original tissue blocks into a fresh paraffin block. The plugs are so small that sampling does not damage the original tissue blocks, yet the spots are large enough to provide a representative view of the tissue morphology. Tissue Bank: The Tissue Bank provides fresh frozen human tumor and normal tissue samples for research purposes. The tissue samples represent a cross section of specimens (these include: colon, stomach, lung, breast, thyroid, kidney, pancreas and a variety of other organs) surgically resected at Rhode Island Hospital and The Molecular Pathology Director: Murray Resnick, MRe snick@lifespan.o rg, FACILITY The COBRE CCR D Proteomics Core provides instrumentation and support personnel for the research efforts of the hosp ital investigators as well as the Acad emic community at large.

Imaging systems based on VisEn's proprietary FMT technology provide non- invasive, whole body, deep tissue imaging in small animal models and generate 3D, information-rich results. These systems are used for research in oncology as well as inflammatory, pulmonary, cardiovascular and skeletal disease. Biological targets and pathways can be monitored and quantified in real time - giving a deeper understanding of the biology unde rlying disease mechanisms and therapeutic response. Microcomput ed Tomographic Imaging Director: tomographic (CT) imaging facility is a resource for the high- resolution imaging of biological samples. CT imaging provides detailed three- dimensional datasets that can be analyzed post hoc to yield quantitative information about specimen morphology. Although ideally suited to the analysis of radio-dense tissues such as bone or teeth, CT has also been used to analyze the microstructure of soft tissues as diverse as lung, kidney, and developing vascular networks. Imaging is performed with a desktop conebeam micro-computed tomography unit (CT 40, Scanco Medical) coupled to an HP DS25 alpha workstation, which drives the scanner and is available for image analysis. The nominal resolution of the system is 6 m, with a 2048 x 2048 image matrix; lower resolution images are also possible. Representative Images "}
