In order for any clinical test to be used most appropriately, it is essential that several parameters be established regarding the test and that these are made known to clinicians to inform their clinical decision making. These include the test's sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios. This article reviews their importance as well as provides an illustrative example that highlights how knowledge of the parameters for a given test allows clinicians to better interpret their test findings in practice. (JCCA 2011; 55(2):69-75) k e y w o r d s : diagnostic test, clinical test, practice Introduction Since the fundamental purpose of any diagnostic test is to help determine whether a patient has or does not have a particular condition, 1,2 clinicians should be aware of cer - tain parameters regarding the tests they use if these tests are to be applied most appropriately and effectively in practice. The most basic parameters that need to be estab- lished regarding any clinical test are that it demonstrates a sufficient degree of reliability and validity. 3-5 If these two important parameters are not met, then the test's value in assisting clinicians to arrive at a diagnosis, form a treat- ment plan, or monitor a patient's progress is question- able. 3-5Reliability refers to the consistency and repeatability of outcomes as measured by the clinical test.3,4 This includes an assessment of whether a test result measured by one examiner would also be obtained by a different examiner performing the test on the same subject at the same time (i.e. inter-examiner agreement) or by the same examiner performing the test on the same subject at a different time (i.e. intra-examiner agreement). 3 Validity refers to whether the clinical test is accurate in measuring what it is purporting to measure. 3,4,6 Of the three types of validity, only \"criterion\" validity is relevant to the evaluation of a clinical test.6 This involves the comparison of results obtained from the clinical test to those obtained from a 70 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) The importance of diagnostic test parameters in the interpretation of clinical test findings \"reference\" (i.e. \"criterion\") diagnostic test which, al- though it provides a more accurate assessment of the con-dition being investigated, is deemed to be too expensive and/or impractical to use routinely in clinical practice. Therefore, most clinical tests are used to classify patients as \"positive\" or \"negative\" depending on the presence or absence (respectively) of a particular sign or symptom, which is then presumed to be indicative of the presence or absence of the condition (i.e. a \"positive\" test result indicates that the patient has the condition). Assessing the validity of a clinical test's usefulness in this regard re-quires knowledge of a variety of parameters, all of which are important and must be individually considered by the clinician in order to appropriately interpret the results he/she obtains when performing the test on a patient. 5,7 These parameters include the test's sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios. The sensitivity of a clinical test is the proportion of sub- jects with the condition who are correctly identified by the test and provide a \"positive\" result.1,2,6-8 Thus, if the sensitivity is high, a \"negative\" test result will effectively rule out the condition. 2 The specificity is the proportion of subjects without the condition who are correctly identi-fied by the test and provide a \"negative\" result. 1,2,6-8 Thus, if the specificity is high, a \"positive\" test result will effect-ively rule in the condition. 2 The positive predictive value is the proportion of subjects with a \"positive\" test result who are correctly diagnosed, whilst the negative predict- ive value is the proportion of subjects with a \"negative\" test result who are correctly diagnosed. 1,2,6,8 Since both the condition's presence (i.e. \"present\" or \"absent\") as well as the test result (i.e. \"positive\" or \"negative\") are categorical in nature, the resulting calculations for these parameters are based on constructing a 2 \u00d7 2 contingency table, as illustrated in Figure 1. There is an important trade-off between these two pairs of parameters. Although the predictive values are more valuable to clinicians since they provide a direct assessment of the usefulness of the test in practice, they are also both influenced by the prevalence of the condi-tion in the population to whom the test is applied. 1,2,6,8 A higher prevalence tends to lead to an increased posi-tive predictive value and a decreased negative predict- ive value, whilst a lower prevalence tends to lead to an increased negative predictive value and a decreased positive predictive value. 8 Therefore, it is vital that the predictive values that are calculated for a clinical test in a particular study sample should not be taken to apply universally. The sensitivity and specificity, on the other hand, are unaffected by the prevalence of the condition, but are not as useful to clinicians since they give little indication as to how good the test is at predicting the cor - rect diagnosis. 1,2,6,8 For these reasons, the use of these four parameters alone can occasionally lead clinicians to make misleading inferences regarding the value of a clin- ical test and, therefore, the results they obtain when using it in practice. 6 As a result, two other parameters, namely the likeli- hood ratios of a positive and negative test, have been sug- gested to be better indicators of the usefulness of a clinical test.1,2,6 Effectively, these ratios compare the probability of getting a test result if the subject truly had the condi-tion with the corresponding probability if he/she did not. Figure 2 illustrates how to calculate these parameters, as well as describes the general consensus on how to inter - pret the resulting values. 1,2,6 Since these ratios effectively summarize the informa- tion contained in each of the four previously-described parameters and are not influenced by the prevalence of the condition, they are considered to be more valuable to clinicians. 2,6 In addition, since likelihood ratios (as well as each of the other four parameters) are proportions, they may be expressed as a percentage and should al- ways be presented with an appropriate confidence inter - val. 1,7,8Condition Present Absent Test Result Positive a b Negative c d Figure 1 An illustration of how to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for a clinical test from a 2 \u00d7 2 contingency table. a = \"True Positives\" Sensitivity = a/(a + c) b = \"False Positives\" Specificity = d/(b + d) c = \"False Negatives\" Positive predictive value = a/(a + b) d = \"True Negatives\" Negative predictive Assoc 2011; 55(2) 71P Bruno The Prone Hip Extension Test The Prone Hip Extension (PHE) Test was one of a series of clinical tests developed by Vladimir Janda as a means of evaluating for motor control deficiencies during specif- ic movements which were proposed to be associated with the development of various musculoskeletal pain syn-dromes. 9,10 Based on his clinical observations, Janda sug- gested that this particular test could be used as a means of assessing for a particular functional muscle imbalance (variously referred to as \"lower crossed syndrome,\" \"dis- tal crossed syndrome,\" or \"pelvic crossed syndrome\") that he deemed to be important in the development and/or perpetuation of low back pain (LBP). Despite slight varia-tions in the traditional descriptions of how to perform the PHE Test, the general procedure was to have the patient lie prone and alternately lift each leg away from the table whilst the clinician observes and/or palpates four muscles of interest - namely the ipsilateral gluteus maximus (GM) and hamstring (HAM) muscles as well erector spinae (IES) and contralateral erector spinae mus- cles (CES) - in an attempt to determine their order of acti- vation. 9-12 Although there was some debate as to what the \"normal\" order of activation should be during the move-ment, with both the GM and HAM being proposed as the muscle that should become active first, there was general agreement that these two muscles should become active prior to the CES and IES. 11-13 Regardless of this debate, the clinician was instructed to assess whether the erector spinae muscles were readily activated and/or the activa- tion of the GM was delayed, which would be indicative of an \"abnormal\" motor pattern for this movement. 9-11,13 As described, the theory behind this \"traditional\" use of the PHE Test was based primarily on clinical observations. However, the amount of published research supporting and quantifying its clinical usefulness in this regard is sparse. To the author's knowledge, there are no published studies which have investigated the validity and reliability of determining the motor patterns that patients use during PHE via observation or palpation. Ergo, the accuracy with which clinicians can detect the muscle activation order by either of these methods, as well as whether the results ob-tained for a particular patient are reproducible by differ - ent clinicians, are unknown. It has been shown that both asymptomatic subjects 14 and LBP patients15 demonstrate a great deal of within-subject variability in the activation orders they use when performing PHE over a series of rep- etitions (which is how this test is commonly performed in practice), and that the absolute differences in the rela-tive onset times of the four muscles are generally quite small. 15-18 Considering these findings, it seems reasonable to question whether a clinician could actually be expected to accurately detect these small differences in muscle onsets by a method other than electromyography, a con- cern which has also been expressed by other authors. 16,17 Even if it was to be demonstrated that the reliability and validity of detecting muscle onsets by observation or pal-pation were sufficiently acceptable for the test to be used by clinicians in this manner, the actual clinical importance of the activation order a patient uses to achieve PHE is questionable. First, there does not appear to be \"normal\" nor \"abnormal\" muscle activation orders for PHE. 14,15 As well, the original contention that a GM onset after that of the erector spinae muscles was \"abnormal\" also appears to be incorrect as several studies have demonstrated that the GM seems to most commonly be the final muscle to be-come active during PHE. 14,15,17,18 Indeed, in both asymp- tomatic subjects and LBP patients, the HAM, IES, and CES appear to generally become active almost simultan- eously and in a seemingly random order, followed by the Likelihood ratio of a positive test = (sensitivity)/(1 - specificity) Likelihood ratio of a negative test = (1 - sensitivity)/(specificity) \u00b7 The higher the likelihood ratio of a positive test, the more certain one can be that a positive test result indicates the sub- ject has the condition. A value of 10 or more is considered an indicator that a positive test result is very good at ruling in the condition. \u00b7 The lower the likelihood ratio of a negative test, the more cer - tain one can be that a negative test result indicates the subject does not have the disorder. A value of 0.1 or less is considered an indicator that a negative test result is very good at ruling out the condition. \u00b7 If a likelihood ratio is close to 1.0, then the test result is not a good indicator whether the subject has (for a positive test re-sult) or does not have (for a negative test result) the condition.

Collectively, these points seriously chal- lenge the appropriateness and clinical value of using the PHE Test as it was traditionally described. More recently, Murphy et al. 5 provided an alternative description of how clinicians should perform and interpret the PHE Test. They proposed that rather than attempting to assess the motor pattern(s) a patient utilizes to achieve the movement, clinicians should instead observe for the presence of the following \"abnormal\" deviations of the lumbar spine during the movement: rotation of the lumbar spine such that the spinous processes appeared to move toward the side of hip extension; a lateral shift of the lum-bar spine toward the side of hip extension; and extension of the lumbar spine. It was suggested that this may be a better indication of suspected \"dynamic instability\" of the lumbar spine than the traditional use of the test. Importantly, the inter-examiner reliability of classify- ing LBP patients as \"Positive\" and \"Negative\" based on the presence or absence (respectively) of the three \"ab-normal\" deviations of the lumbar spine motion described above has been found to be good. 5 There is, however, a paucity of published research attempting to explain the underlying motor control strategies that account for the presence or absence of these deviations. A preliminary study using asymptomatic subjects demonstrated that the presence of one or more of the deviations was associated with a significant delay in the onset of the GM. 19 Although it is unknown at present if these findings are generalizable to the LBP population, they would seem to suggest that the presence of these deviations have the potential to be used as an indirect indicator that an \"abnormal\" motor pattern is present in the form of a significantly delayed onset of the GM during PHE. However, in order for clin-icians to more appropriately interpret their findings when using the PHE Test in this manner, they must first con- sider the validity of using the presence of these deviations as being \"diagnostic\" of this underlying motor pattern. To this end, knowledge of the test's sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios is necessary. The Presence of \"Abnormal\" Lumbar Spine Deviations During the PHE Test as Being Diagnostic of a Significantly Delayed Onset of the GM: A Consideration of its Diagnostic Test Parameters As outlined in the previous section, it has been shown that the presence of one or more of the lumbar spine devia-tions seems to be associated with a significant delay in the onset of the GM during PHE in asymptomatic subjects. It must be stressed, however, that this finding was based on the calculation and comparison of group averages. In other words, the average onset time of the GM during sets of PHE that demonstrated the deviations was compared to the average onset time of the GM during sets of PHE that did not. As an author of this particular paper, I can attest to the fact that not all of the sets classified as \"Posi-tive\" demonstrated a large delay in GM onset compared to those classified as \"Negative.\" The same holds true for those classified as \"Negative\" (i.e. a minority of these sets demonstrated a delay in GM onset comparable to those classified as \"Positive\"). Thus, the presence of these \"false positives\" and \"false negatives\" necessitate the calcula-tion of the test's sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios in order to comment on the inher - ent value that \"positive\" and \"negative\" test results would have for clinicians. One caveat that must be emphasized at this point is that since only asymptomatic subjects were used in the cited study, values for these parameters can-not be established for the LBP population based on these data. The following calculations are provided merely for illustrative purposes and should not be taken to inform clinical decisions if/when the PHE Test is performed in clinical practice on LBP patients. It has been highlighted that diagnostic test parameters analyze a test's ability to diagnose the presence or absence of a condition by the presence or absence of a particular sign or symptom. As such, the first issue that must be ad-dressed is to define the \"condition\" that the PHE Test is being used to diagnose in this case. Simply stating that the test is attempting to determine the presence or absence of a \"significantly delayed GM onset\" during PHE is in- sufficient since the muscle onset time data is continuous in nature and the test parameters require categorical out-comes for the condition (i.e. the condition is either present or absent). It is therefore necessary to select a specific magnitude for the onset delay above which the relative onset of the GM is defined as \"significantly delayed\" (i.e. the condition is present), and below which it is defined as \"not significantly delayed\" (i.e. the condition is absent). Since there is no universally accepted standard that is used to define that a particular muscle's onset is \"sig-nificantly delayed\" for this movement, the decision as to J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) 73P Bruno what magnitude of onset delay to select for the \"cut-off\" will need to be somewhat subjective for the purpose of this example. Several studies have demonstrated a signifi- cant delay in the onset of the transversus abdominis dur - ing various arm and leg movements in LBP subjects, with the magnitude of the delay varying from ~60 ms to 165 ms depending on the specific movement the subjects were asked to perform. 20-22 It has been suggested that these onset delays are potentially indicative of motor control deficits that may lead to inefficient lumbar spine stabil- ization. A delayed onset of 110 ms will therefore be se- lected as being indicative of a motor control deficit during PHE that represents inefficient lumbar spine stabilization since it is the approximate mid-point of the range pro-vided. Thus, the \"condition\" will be deemed present (i.e. the GM onset will be deemed \"significantly delayed\") if the relative onset delay exceeds 110 ms. Conversely, the \"condition\" will be deemed absent if the relative onset delay is less than 110 ms. Using this definition, an analysis of the raw data col- lected for the cited study (not presented) can be ana- lyzed to categorize the PHE sets classified as \"Positive\" into \"true positives\" (i.e. those which demonstrate a \"significantly delayed\" GM onset) and \"false positives\" (i.e. those which do not demonstrate a \"significantly de-layed\" GM onset). This reveals 7 \"true positives\" and 6 \"false positives.\" Likewise, the \"Negative\" PHE sets can be categorized into \"true negatives\" (i.e. those which do not demonstrate a \"significantly delayed\" GM onset) and \"false negatives\" (i.e. those which demonstrate a \"signifi-cantly delayed\" GM onset). This reveals 26 \"true nega-tives\" and 4 \"false negatives.\" These values can then be inserted into a 2 \u00d7 2 contingency table and used in the calculations in each of the test parameters (see Figure 3). These calculated values lend themselves to several implications regarding the appropriateness of using the presence of the previously-described \"abnormal\" lumbar spine motion patterns during the performance of the PHE Test as being diagnostic of an underlying \"significant de- lay\" in GM onset. Although the specificity indicates that the value of a positive test result at ruling in the condition is relatively high, only 53.8% of the positive test results were correct. In addition, whilst 86.7% of the negative test results were correct, the sensitivity indicates that the value of a negative test result at ruling out the condition is only moderate. Since predictive values are affected by the prevalence of the condition, it could be argued that these apparent contradictions may be explained by the rela-tively low prevalence of the condition in this particular sample of subjects, which may have had an effect to raise the negative predictive value and lower the positive pre-dictive value. This reinforces the need to consider the cal-culated likelihood ratios, both of which indicate that the value of positive and negative test results are \"somewhat useful.\" 6 It would be essential for clinicians to know and con-\"Significantly Delayed\" GM Onset Present Absent PHE Test Result Positive 7 6 Negative 4 26 Sensitivity = 7/(7 + 4) = 0.636 63.6% (95% CI: 35.4 81.3% 64.7 to 0.538 53.8% (95% CI: 29.1 to = 0.867 86.7% (95% CI: 70.3 to 94.7) Likelihood ratio (0.636)/(1 - 0.813) 3.394 (95% CI: 1.437 to 7.803) Likelihood (1 - 0.636)/(0.813) 0.448 (95% CI: 0.184 to 0.831)Figure 3 The sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios of the PHE Test for diagnosing the presence or absence of a \"significant delay\" in GM onset as calculated from the data collected in Bruno et al.

It should be emphasized once again, however, that the implications described above should not be generalized to the LBP population since the parameters have only been calculated here for illustrative purposes. Conclusion It is essential that, whenever possible, clinicians know and make use of specific parameters related to the diagnostic tests they use in practice in order to appropriately inter - pret their clinical findings. This would allow for more in- formed decision making when it comes to the diagnosis and management of a patient's condition. Although these parameters have been established for many tests used in health care, this is not universally true. Henceforth, it is crucial that further research be conducted to establish these parameters for the variety of clinical tests that are used by health care practitioners.

Methods: A three step search strategy of the literature involved electronic searching, hand searching and reference tracking. Results: One hundred and eighty eight articles germane to chiropractic geriatric practice and education were retrieved. Discussion: Compared to the review of the literature conducted prior to 2000, the number of references on chiropractic geriatric education increased from 3 to 11, the number of demographic studies increased from 9 to 18, the number of case reports increased from 25 to 83, the number of clinical trials increased from 4 to 21 (only two RCTs found) and the number of references on clinical guidelines and general clinical information increased from 18 to 55. Conclusion: This review found 188 retrievable articles available to practitioners to effectively care plan for their older patients, a better than three fold increase in the number of references found during a similar review conducted at the end of the previous decade. However, there is clearly a gap in the evidence base of chiropractic geriatric care, particularly the under-representation of clinical trials of all kinds involving older chiropractic patients.(JCCA 2011; 55(2):76-95) k e y w o r d s : geriatric, chiropractic, older patientJ Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) 77BJ Gleberzon Introduction After World War Two, the surge in the birth rates in the Allied Power countries (i.e. Canada, the United King- dom, Australia and the United States) began what is now colloquially referred to as the \"baby boom,\" with this demographic group spanning the years between 1946 and 1965. 1 The Boomers represent the largest single demo- graphic cohort in these countries and their influence, in terms of sheer numbers, monetary impact and political clout has been felt in virtually every socio-cultural insti- tution, from education to labour to healthcare. 1 The year 2011 is something of a watershed moment since the lead- ing edge of the Boomers will turn 65 years old, the age traditionally associated with turning \"old\" since it is the age of eligibility for most national entitlement programs (social insurance, for example). Several years ago, this author conducted a review of the literature on chiropractic geriatric care prior to the year 2001 in an attempt to further strengthen the profession's cultural authority and establish an evidence-based care approach. 2 Since that time, there has been an exponential growth in the number of publications and presentations on this topic and it would therefore be timely to perform a narrative literature review of the chiropractic literature re- garding older patients during the intervening years, pub-lished between 2001 and 2010. MethodsSearch Strategy A three step literature review strategy was employed for this study. The first step involved a conventional electronic literature search using the following search strategy: The databases Index to Chiropractic Literature, PubMed and CINAHL were searched from 2000-2010 (English only) to August 2010. The Index to Chiropractic Literature was searched using subject headings \"Aged\" or \"Geriatrics\" or \"Geriatric Assessment\" or older or geriatric* or elder.* PubMed was searched using text word chiropract* and the following MeSH terms: Accidental Falls, Geriatric Assessment, Health Services for the Aged, and (Aged or Aged 65+ or 80. Key words \"Manipulation,\" \"Spinal Manipulation,\" and \"Chiroprac-tic\" were combined with the age limiters and the search also included \"In Process\" records for Chiropract* using the EBSCO MEDLINE. The same search strategy was used to search CINAHL.This strategy yielded 112 articles, 3 of which, upon subsequent review, were found to be introduction and subsequent discussion of the same case study. Fourteen of the articles found did not meet the inclusion requirements (see below); thus, this search strategy yielded 95 relevant citations. The second step of this review involved hand- searching chiropractic journals (Journal of the Can-adian Chiropractic Association, Journal of Chiropractic Medicine, Journal of Chiropractic Education, Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics, Clin- ical Chiropractic, Topics In Clinical Chiropractic, Jour - nal of Neuromusculoskeletal Systems, and Journal of the American Chiropractic Association) and two inter - national chiropractic conferences (World Federation of Chiropractic and Association of Chiropractic Colleges - Research Agenda Conference) between 2001-2010. However, in order to not over-inflate the number of ref-erences retrieved by this review, if a topic was presented at a conference and subsequently published in a peer-reviewed journal, those manuscripts were combined and only counted once. Since this article is meant to cap- ture all the literature germane to chiropractic and older patients, a decision was made to include conference proceedings even though it must be emphasized that the level of peer review for such conferences is often much less stringent than it is for publication of manuscripts in indexed journals. The reader is reminded that this study is a tabulation of the literature retrievable between 2001 and 2010 and not a systematic review of that literature. That said, the next step will be to conduct a systematic review of the case series, systematic reviews, observa- tional studies and randomized clinical trials retrieved during this study. The third step of this study was reference tracking (re- viewing the references of many of the articles retrieved by the first two search strategies to further capture other pertinent references). This tertiary step yielded additional source material, principally in the form of textbook chap-ters, conference workshops, government briefs, Coch-rane Reviews and Guidelines from organizations such as the American Geriatric Society and the World Health Organization; however, those references not specifically germane to chiropractic geriatric care are listed under \"miscellaneous references\" and were not included in the final tally.78 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) A narrative review of the published chiropractic literature regarding older patients from 2001-2010 Inclusion Criteria All citations found that discussed chiropractic and patients age 55 years and older published between 2001-2010 have been included in this study, following the example of the review article that characterized older chiropractic patients published by Hawk et al. in 2000. 3 Studies that involved mixed populations4-13 were excluded; however, studies that utilized \"osteopathic manipulation\" were in-cluded in this study given the biomechanical similarity of this modality in the chiropractic and osteopathy profes- sions. Lastly, articles that were included in the previous re- view by Gleberzon 2 were not included in this review even if they appeared in any of the search strategies employed. Grouping of the articles retrieved during this study was problematic given the divergent nature of many of these studies. It was therefore decided that, in order to facilitate the comparison of the articles retrieved during this study with the articles retrieved from the previous study pub-lished in 2001 2 the same topic headings would be used: These were: (a) chiropractic geriatric education (this included articles that discuss education and training of students in the area of geriatric care taught at accredited chiro-practic colleges); (b) demographics and epidemiological studies (this included studies on utilizations rates of chiropractic services by older patients and the characteristics of those patients); (c) case reports and case series (d) clinical trials (this includes outcome studies, ob-servational studies as well as practice-based and ran-domized clinical trials) and; (e) guidelines and other clinical information (this was often in the form of general information for patient care and systematic reviews on a particular topic such as falls prevention). To better position the articles retrieved, manuscripts that discuss clinical trial protocols, patient recruitment or study feasibility have been included in section (d) clinical trials under a sub-heading of \"clinical trials to be conducted. \" Retrieved articles that are thematically-based reviews (i.e. fall prevention, assessment procedures for older patients, importance of exercise for the elderly) have been included under section (e) guidelines and clinical information (see Table 1).Where ever possible, articles are ordered first chrono- logically (by year of publication) and then alphabetically (by last name of first author) in each sub-heading. Results(a) Geriatric Chiropractic Education (n = 11) Eleven articles were found on geriatric chiropractic edu- cation. On these articles, six 14,17,20-23 discussed the struc- ture and development of the geriatric courses in the core curriculum or as an elective at specific chiropractic col- leges (often emphasizing the importance of an interdisci- plinary approach), one discussed the development of a community-based program for interns, 15 one specifically described strategies to combat ageism through student education, 16 two discussed developing \"Best Practices\" for older patients18,19 and one article was a survey of all chiropractic courses offered in North America.24 (b) Demographics and Epidemiological Studies(n = 18)Studies investigating utilization rates of chiropractic ser - vices by older patients and characteristics of older people who seek out chiropractic care (n = 14) Fourteen articles were found that essentially identified the types of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) in general and chiropractic care in particular, that older persons sought out and the characteristics that predicted they would do so. 25-28 Each study involved dif- ferent survey instruments and sought to gather different information. In general, taken as a group, these articles indicated that CAM use was high among older patients and that they most commonly sought out herbal remedies, chiropractic or massage therapy in various order de-pending on the reference. Acupuncture was the next most common CAM modality reportedly used by older pa-tients. Predictors of CAM use in general and chiropractic use in particular were being female 34,37 [with the excep- tion of the article by Ness et al27 which reported men were more likely to seek out chiropractors although less likely to seek out CAM providers in general], having a higher education,33,35,37 higher income,27,29,35 more frequent vis- its to physicians,27,29 alcohol use27,29 and being able to drive.29 Also, older patients who identified themselves as being more spiritual were more likely to seek out CAM care.33,34,37 African-American29,34 and Hispanic29,34 pa- tients were less likely than Caucasians to seek CAM J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) 79BJ Gleberzon or chiropractic care. This data is similar to the informa- tion gathered by Hawk et al. in 2000.3 Older patients most commonly sought out CAM pro- viders for pain-related symptoms,26,29,30,37,38 most notably various types of arthritis.29,30 Second to pain, one study indicated that older patients sought out chiropractic care to improve their quality of life 26 and two studies reported older patients sough out chiropractic care for health main-tenance. 26,30 This finding is similar to an earlier study by Rupert et al.39 Older patients reported being satisfied with the care they received in two studies30,33 and respondents in another study reported the care they received was bene-ficial to them.26 These finding are also consistent with early studies by Hawk et al.3 and Rupert et al.39 Epidemiological studies involving older patients and predictors of pain (n = 4)Four studies sought to investigate various factors influ- encing the development of back pain among older per - sons. 40-43 D'Astolfo and Humphreys40 reported that the majority of residents in a long term care (LTC) facility in Ontario were women, osteoporotic with mild to moderate dementia but low levels of depression and could walk in- dependently or with an assistive device.

There were two case reports of adverse reactions to ma- nipulation among older patients with complicated clinical profiles123,124 and two case series125,126 were retrieved in this study. Successful management of diagnosed clinical conditions by chiropractors (n = 39)Thirty-nine articles chronicled the successful management of the following clinical conditions treated with a pleth-ora of presenting chief complaints. These were: osteoarth-ritis of the radiculopathy,54 spondylo- sis of L2 in identical twins,55 acute fracture of the eighth thoracic vertebrae,56 far lateral disk herniation,57 grade II acromioclavicular spine stenosis,59 lumbar compart- ment syndrome,65 longitudinal ligament,66 myelopathy,67 medically-treated asthma,68 depressive chronic migraine,76 intractable back pain associated with compression fracture treated by percussion vertebroplasty, 77 adhesive capsulitis and improvement in kyphoscoliosis,78 stenosis resulting in low back and knee pain using Class IV laser. 82 Serious clinical conditions masquerading as back pain (n = 40)Forty articles discussed the diagnosis of a serious clinical condition initially attributed to mechanical back pain or an otherwise relatively innocuous problem. These articles chronicled the following clinically significant conditions presenting among older patients to chiropractors' offices: B-cell lymphoma masquerading as low back and leg pain, 83 heart failure and insufficiency of aortic and mi- tral valve secondary to rheumatoid arthritis,84 fracture heterotrophic bone fracture in traumatica, 85 cervical fracture-dislocation,86 neuro- pathic arthropathy foot of a patient with diabetes,87 porcelain gallbladder presenting as low back and heel pain, 88 post-traumatic compression fracture,89 bizarre neurological symptoms precipitated by a fall diagnosed as Dejerine-Roussy Syndrome, 90 atypical presentation of a deep vein thrombosis,91 popliteal aneurysm presenting as leg pain,92 comorbidity secondary to breast cancer,95 breast cancer presenting as sacroiliac pain and radiculopathy,96 low back pain caused by disk herni- ation visible upon surgical inspection but not on advanced imaging, 97 abnormal course of vertebral artery found in a cadaver,98 congestive heart failure presenting as neck and shoulder pain,99 malignant pleural mesothelioma,100 vertebral osteomyelitis presenting as LBP and hip pain,102 abdominal aortic aneurysm presenting pain,103 osteomyelitis quent to osteoarthritis re- sulting hand pain,106 gout resulting in wrist,107 bone infarct (osteonecrosis) presenting as knee pain,108 Parkinson's disease masquerading as LBP,109 knee pain diagnosed non- specific back pain,112 thoracic spine pain attributed to upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage,113 minimally response carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosed as avascular necrosis of the scaphoid,114 spontaneous cervical epidural hematoma presenting as severe neck pain,115 chronic low back pain diagnosed as vertebral sarcoidosis,116 renal cell carcinoma causing LBP,117 hyperparathyroidism presenting as back pain and swelling of fourth digit,118 brain stem compres- sion and atlantoaxial instability secondary to rheumatoid arthritis presenting as chronic neck pain, 119 detection of aortic abdominal aneurysm,120 abdominal and low back pain diagnosed as metastasis from prostate cancer121 and Paget's disease resulting in progressive thoracic pain.122 Adverse reaction to manipulation among older patients (n = 2)Two articles discussed adverse reactions to manipulation among older patients with serious clinical conditions. In one case, a spinal epidural hematoma occurred in an older patient on anticoagulants after spinal manipulative therapy 123 and another case discussed anterior and poster - ior fixation of a cervical fracture induced by chiropractic spinal manipulation in an older patient with ankylosing spondylitis. 124 Case series (n = 2) Zhang et al. reported on a retrospective case series involv-ing 13 older patients (only two under age 55 years) with urinary incontinence (UI) who were treated using the Pro-Adjuster technique. 125 The patients all presented with spinal or leg complaints but divulged that they also had UI during their interviews. Patients were treated between 1 and 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was fre- quency of nocturia, as recorded by the patient. All 13 pa-tients reported improvements in their urination frequency after their treatment schedules, and two patients reported improvements after only 2 adjustments. Similarly positive results were reported by Hains et al. 8 Doherty reported a case series involving 8 frail older women, ages 68-89 years old, all of whom had chronic obstructive lung disease. 126 Doherty treated these patients (1 man, 7 women) using spinal manipulative therapy, rib mobilization and/or instrumented adjusting over a 4 week period of time (total of 12 manipulative sessions provid- ed). At each treatment, patients were asked to describe any adverse events they experienced from the previous treatment session and to grade the severity of the adverse reaction on a pain visual analog scale (pain-V AS) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worse pain imaginable). One patient did not report any adverse reactions at all. Among the other 7 patients, the number of adverse events ranges from 2 to 8 per patient over the course of care and these patients reported the severity of pain ranged from 2.0 to 5.9 on the pain-V AS. All the adverse reactions reported were mild transient events. None of the patients reported any serious adverse events over the course of therapy, such as fracture or significant bruising. (d) Clinical Trials (n = 21) Studies in this category were divided into two main groups: (i) Studies that describe clinical trials that have yet to be conducted (n = 8), 127-134 and (ii) studies that pro- vide the results of clinical trials that have been conducted (n = 13). 135-147 Of those studies that have been complet- ed, five did not involve the use of manual therapies135-139 whereas the other eight140-147 investigated the effects of manual therapies on older patients, one study using mobilization (administered by a physiotherapist) 140 and seven using manipulation administered by a chiroprac-tor 141-144 or an osteopath.145-147 To date, there have only been two randomized clinical trials involving chiropractic adjustments/manipulation and older patients. 141,147 Clinical Trials to be conducted (n = 8)Eight studies were found that describe the recruitment, design, protocols or feasibilities of various interventions for older patients. 127-134 Specifically, studies described future clinical trials involving older patients LBP only,127 LBP or neck pain,128 knee pain,129 dizziness, neck pain and balance issues130-133 and pneumonia.134 Completed clinical trials involving older patients not involving manual therapies (n = 5)With respect to interventional studies not involving manual therapies, five studies were retrieved. 135-139 Two of these studies135,136 were cross-sectional observational studies and the other three studies137-139 were interven- tional studies. Uthaikhup and Jull reported that the cranial cervical flexion test, thought to test the coordination of the deep and superficial cervical flexor muscles, is altered in a group of 82 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) A narrative review of the published chiropractic literature regarding older patients from 2001-2010 healthy asymptomatic elderly test subjects compared to a similar group of younger patients.135 Another study by Champagne et al. reported that lumbopelvic muscle en- durance and perceived exertion did not differ between two groups of healthy older and younger test subjects.136 Haas et al. reported that a chronic disease self-manage- ment program had no advantages over a wait-list control group of older patients with chronic LBP with respect to improving pain, general health, self-efficacy and self-care attitudes, although there may have been some benefit with respect to patient's emotional well-being, fatigue, func-tional disability and days with disability. 137 Lorig et al. reported that Internet-based arthritis self-management program (ASMP) were a viable alternative to small group ASMP among a group of older patients with arthritis and fibromyalgia in terms of significant improvement in 4 of 6 health status measurements. 138 Lastly, Hess and Wollacott reported that high intensity strength-training targeting lower extremity muscles can be used safely and effectively in balance-impaired older patients, resulting in significant improvement in functional balance ability and decreased risk of falls, as monitored using the Berg Balance Scale, Timed Get and Go Test and Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale. 139 Completed clinical trials involving older patients involving manual therapies (n = 8)A rather unique study was conducted by Bautmans et al. involving 15 older patients with severe dementia and dys- phagia. 140 Trained physiotherapists administered cervical spine mobilization in a randomized controlled trial with cross-over. The control group consisted of socializing visits. The researchers reported that swallowing capacity improved significantly after cervical spine mobilization after one session and after one week of treatment. 140 No adverse effects were reported. Seven studies141-147 monitored the effects of manipula- tion on older persons, four studies involving chiropractic manipulation and three studies involving osteopathic ma- nipulation. Hawk et al. described a study involving 81 older pa- tients who were experiencing chronic musculoskel- etal pain. 141 One group was treated using BioEnergetic Synchronization Technique (BEST), a mind-body, non-manipulation light touch approach, along with verbal suggestions, group lectures, self-empowerment strategies and lifestyle and nutritional modifications. This group was compared to a group of patients who received HVLA thrusting Diversified-style manipulations, in addition to modalities, soft tissue therapies, and advice on exercise and nutrition. For this study, outcome measures included Pain Disability Index (PDI), Beck Depression Inventory, clinicians' expectation of improvement, patients' expecta- tion of improvement, time spent during intervention, and evaluation of clinic services. Treatment in both groups was provided over a four week period, and treatment ses-sions for patients in the BEST group lasted one to two hours whereas treatment sessions of patients receiving SMT lasted 10 to15 minutes. 141 At the end of the four week study, changes in the PDI for patients under BEST care was 6.9; for patients receiv- ing Diversified care, PDI scores were on average 6.4. These differences were not statistically or clinically sig- nificant. However, it was interesting to read that all the doctors delivering BEST care expected all of their pa- tients to completely recover whereas only two thirds of the Diversified doctors expected their patients to recover at all. This may speak to the impact the practitioner's ex- pectation of patient's outcome has on the degree to which patients respond to care and the subsequent power of the clinical encounter, especially if it is augmented by posi-tive expectations by both the doctor and patient. 141 In 2009, Hawk et al. reported the results of a larger practice-based clinical trial investigating the effects of two different schedules of care compared to a schedule of no care, for a group of older patient with dizziness, balance difficulties and spinal pain. 142,143 Specifically, 34 patients were enrolled in this study and divided into three different groups. Group 1 (n = 13) received a schedule of chiropractic care (described below) for 8 weeks, with 2 visits per week (\"limited schedule\"). Group 2 (n = 15) received chiropractic care for 8 weeks with 2 visits per week followed by 10 months with one visit per month (extended schedule). Chiropractic care consisted of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT, described as \"Diversified technique\"), including extravertebral manipulations of the hip, knee, ankle and foot, in addition to soft tissue therapy and the application of hot packs. In the event SMT was contraindicated, the practitioner substituted instrumented-adjusting or table-assisted procedures. The third group (n = 6) were only provided with brochures containing lifestyle advice and instructed to do home ex-J Can number of factors were monitored in this study, the primary outcome measure was scoring as measured by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). 142,143 Among those patients with dizziness, improvement on the BBS was demonstrated only among participants in both Group 1 and 2 of the study at 1 month and remained much lower than baseline throughout the study. This improvement was not seen among Group 3 participants. Moreover, pain as measured by the Pain Disability Index showed greater improvement from baseline to 1 year in Group 2 compared with the other groups. There were no treatment-related adverse effects reported. 142,143 Another randomized clinical trial compared two types of SMT to minimal conservative care for older adults 55 years and older with low back pain was con- ducted by Hondras et al. 144 In this study involving 240 participants (average age 63 years) subacute or chronic low back sufferers received either HVLA side-posture Diversified-style spinal manipulation or low velocity, variable-amplitude spinal manipulation, such as Cox- Flexion distraction technique. Patient responses from both intervention groups were compared to a group of patients who received minimal conservative care (control group). Participants in both intervention groups were scheduled to receive a maximum of 12 treatments at a frequency of no more than 3 times for the first two weeks and 2 times per week for the third and fourth week and once per week thereafter. Manipulation in both groups was restricted to between T12 and L5 spinal levels and the SI joints. Participants in the control group were given a 30-minute home exercise program. 144 At the end of the treatment sessions, the study team re- ported that both biomechanically distinct forms of spinal manipulation did not lead to different outcomes among older low back pain patients, and both forms of therapy were associated with small yet clinically important chan-ges in functional status as compared to the control group. No adverse reactions were reporting during this study. The authors concluded that patient preference as well as clinical experience should drive how clinicians and pa- tients determine which form of spinal manipulation to use for older patients with back pain. 144 Noll and his colleagues have published a number of articles chronically the effects of osteopathic manipula-tion on patients with pneumonia, three of which met the inclusion criteria of this study. 145-147 The most recent arti-cle, a randomized clinical trial involving 35 elderly (>65 years old) patients reported that the osteopathic manipula-tion group displayed a statistically significant decrease in forced expiratory flow at 25% and 50% of vital capacity and at midexpiratory phase, a decrease in expiratory re- serve volume and airway resistance. In addition, this group of patients had a statistically significant improve-ment in residual volume and total lung capacity. Most sub-jects (82%) of patients receiving osteopathic manipulation reported \"breathing easier.\" In their systematic review of manual therapies, Bronfort et al. concluded that \"there is inconclusive evidence in a favorable direction regarding the effectiveness of manual therapy for the treatment of acute pneumonia in elderly hospitalized patients.\" 148 (e) Guidelines and Clinical Information (n = 55) General practice guidelines for chiropractic care planning for older patients (n = 42) A number of articles by content experts have been pub-lished in the peer reviewed literature to assist practition-ers with the appropriate case management of the myriad of health challenges that preferentially effect older pa-tients. Schneider described the role of chiropractors in pain management for oncology patients, 149 Morley de- scribed recent advances in geriatric care from a medical perspective in 2001 in one article,150 provided nutritional considerations of older people in another151 and Stump reviewed management of neuroarticular lesions on the elderly. 152 Other articles have discussed, in general terms, the challenges practitioners confront when managing older patients, 156,158,159,160,161 the importance of an inte- grated approach to manage these challenges153,154 and the advocacy for a wellness-based approach to health care. 155,157,162 One article specifically discussed the chiropractic man- agement of foot problems163 and four articles discussed the chiropractic management of disorders of the upper limb 164-167 among older patients. Other articles discussed the chiropractic management of osteoporotic fractures,168 the management of osteoarthritis and osteoporosis from a chiropractic perspective, 169 the role of chiropractic in managing patients with multiple sclerosis170 the signs and symptoms of stroke171 and the benefits of exercise for older patients.172 Eleven articles by chiropractic authors specifically dis-84 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) A narrative review of the published chiropractic literature regarding older patients from 2001-2010 cussed strategies to reduce falls (fall prevention) in the peer-reviewed literature.173-183 In addition, a national program in Canada for chiropractors targeting their older patients discussed fall prevention; a DVD containing risk factors, demographic information, assessment tools and management recommendations was mailed to all members of the Canadian Chiropractic Association in 2008. 184 Stuber et al.185 reviewed the literature on the use of chiropractic for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), a condition commonly affecting elderly patients. These reviewers were only able to find 6 articles that met their inclusion criteria (4 case reports, 1 case series and 1 observational cohort study). Despite this paucity of evidence, these reviewers concluded that the available evidence pointed towards chiropractic care (most often in the form of SMT or flexion-distraction manipulation) was potentially beneficial for patients with LSS. 185 Addition- ally, Kline recently authored two editorials that consisted of interviews of content experts who discuss the appropri- ate management of LSS.186,187 Three articles have been written specifically on the topic of providing spinal manipulation/adjustments for older patients188-190 and the most current article found during this search was a Best Practice consensus docu-ment by Hawk et al. 191 That Best Practice article used a Delphi process of over 30 content experts and provides an evidence-based approach to the assessment (history taking, physical examination, diagnostic imaging) and management (use of different chiropractic technique sys-tems, care planning) of older patients, including issues of jurisprudence, safety and a list of absolute and relative contraindications to care. 191 Workshops, Conference Platform & Other Chiropractic Geriatric References (n = 13)A number of workshops and platform presentations have been provided at large international conferences between 2001 and 2010 on the topic of chiropractic care for older patients. Byfield, 192-194 Doherty195 and Sportelli196 have provided important information on providing chiroprac-tic care (specifically spinal adjusting) for older patients and Gleberzon 197,198 and Freedman199 provided platform presentation and a workshop on issues of quality of life for seniors (wellness, fall prevention and mental health). Since 2001, there have been two textbooks pub-lished specifically on the topic of chiropractic geriatric care,200,201 the \"White House\" brief, a submission on chiropractic care to Congress in the United States202 and two textbook chapters on issues specific to older chiro- practic patients.203,204 Miscellaneous referencesIt would be remiss to not cite those references that, al-though not specific to chiropractic geriatric care, provide important information towards it. Important sources of in- formation include Guidelines on fall prevention and pain management for older patients by the American Geriatric Society, 205-207 the Report on Senior's Falls in Canada by the Public Health Agency of Canada,208 two reports by the World Health Organization (WHO), one on \"Active Ageing\" 209 and the other on falls prevention210 and four reports from the Cochrane Collaboration on the topics of fall prevention,211 rehabilitation for older patients,212 exercise213 and strength training214 for improvement in balance and physical function. Discussion Compared to the review of the literature conducted in 2001 2 there has been a greater than threefold increase in the number of retrievable articles and references on geriat-ric chiropractic care of older persons (see Table 2). Specif- ically, the number of references pertaining to chiropractic geriatric education has increased from 3 to 11, the number of demographic and epidemiological studies has increased from 9 to 18, the number of case reports and case series has increased from 25 to 83, the number of clinical trials has increased from 4 to 21 (although four of these clinical trials investigated osteopathic rather than chiropractic ma- nipulation) and the number of references on clinical guide-lines and general clinical information for practitioners has increased from 18 to 55; this includes the publication of two textbooks that exclusively focus on chiropractic care for older patients. 200,201 In total, then, there has been an in- crease in the number of published references in the chiro- practic literature regarding older patients from 59 up to the year 2000 to 188 between 2001 and 2010. That said, only two studies published in between 2001 and 2010 were randomized clinical trials which, despite their limitations, are still considered the \"gold standard\" of research evidence. 148 Despite this paucity of RCTs in the evidence base, Bronfort et al. 55(2) 85BJ Gleberzon tensive review the literature of manual procedures that there is \"moderate quality evidence that spinal manipula-tion/mobilization is an effective treatment option for sub- acute and chronic LBP in older adults.\" 148:p17 From Evidence-Based to Best Patient- Centred CareIt bears repeating that \"Best Practices\" do not and should not rely solely on the results of RCTs or meta-analyses of these RCTs. 215-218 Sackett was very clear in this regard when he first advocated for the Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) movement in the late 1990s. His oft-quoted pos- ition was that: \"EBM means integrating individual clinical exper - tise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research ... By best available exter - nal clinical evidence, we mean clinically relevant re-search, often from the basic sciences of medicine, but especially from patient-centered clinical research. Without clinical expertise, practice risks becoming tyrannized by external evidence, for even excellent external evidence may be inapplicable to or inappro- priate for an individual patient. Without current best external evidence, practice risks becoming rapidly out of date, to the detriment of patients. \" (215p1186) Furthermore, during his testimony before an Inquest held in Ontario in 2004, when asked about relying only on evi-dence to guide health care decisions, Sackett informed the jury that, while at Oxford, only 47% of medical proced-ures used for patient care had been proven effective and banning procedures not shown to be effective by random- ized clinical trials \"would shut down the healthcare sys-tem,\" essentially grinding it to a screeching halt. 216 Echoing the sentiments by Mootz219 who discussed the importance of both a molecular and contextual approach to patient care, with the utilization of both qualitative and quantitative outcome measures respectively as described by Bolton, 220 Triano218 reminded the reader that the \"evi- dence-based\" was never meant to be \"evidence-entrained\" and the elements of \"context\" that matter for clinical deci- sion making include (i) the complexity of the case, (ii) best available evidence, (iii) practitioner's expertise and ex-perience and, (perhaps most importantly) (iv) patient pref-erences and beliefs. 218 These factors are important since RCTs can rarely be applied to individual patients since they attempt to \"fit to the mean,\" thus theoretically not tak- ing into account the 50% of cases that deviate from the norm. 218 Elsewhere, Rosner has discussed the limitations of RCTs.217 Meta-analyses present similarly problematic limitations, including (i) bias of the selection criteria of studies to be included for review, (ii) lack a standardized analyses and systematic method to validate new analysis methods and, (iii) poor consistency and/or accuracy of investigative reviewers during the application of criteria during the analysis. 218 Haynes and his colleagues may have captured this issue best when they wrote:Type of StudyNumber of studies foundIn 2001 review 1Number of studies foundduring this review (c2010) Chiropractic geriatric education 3 11 Demographic/ Epidemiological 9 18 Case studies/ series 25 83 Clinical trials 4 21 Guidelines and general clinical information 18 55 Total all studies 59 188Table 2 Comparison of the number of references retrieved between a review of the literature published in 2001 1 and this review86 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) A narrative review of the published chiropractic literature regarding older patients from 2001-2010 \"Subsequent versions of evidence-based decision- making have emphasized that research evidence alone is never an adequate guide to action. Rather, clin- icians must apply their expertise to assess patient's problem, and must also incorporate the research evi-dence and the patient's preference or values before making a management recommendation\" (221pA11) Thus there seems to be emerging a new paradigm, one that can be termed \"Patient-Centered Evidence-Base Health Care\" which is constructed from an amalgam of patient preference, research evidence and clinical experi- ence and can have as its rallying cry: \"Evidence does not make decisions- people do.\" 221pA11 Chiropractic care and adverse effectsWith respect to safety, it would appear that spinal ma-nipulative therapy can be safely provided for older pa- tients, even the frail elderly. 126 Cassidy et al.222 sought to investigate the association between chiropractic care and vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) stroke and to compare it the association between recent primary care physicians (PCP) care and VBA stroke, using an epidemiological de-sign. Based on a review of all VBA stroke cases admitted to Ontario hospitals between 1993 and 2002 (mean age of patients 63 years), the researchers concluded that, firstly, VBA stroke is a very rare event with only 818 cases oc- curring in that time span and, secondarily patients over 45 years old were three times as likely to seek out a chiroprac-tor or a PCP before experiencing a stroke. In other words, patient with headache or neck pain were just as likely to consult either a chiropractor or PCP before their stroke and there was no evidence of excess risk of VBA stroke associated with either chiropractic or medical care. In all likelihood, these patients were experiencing a stroke-in-progress and the care they sought did not exacerbate the stroke itself. A study of 280 patients (13% of whom were over the age of 60 years) reported most adverse effects related to chiropractic care were minor transient muscle soreness that typically resolved with 24 hours of its oc-currence 223 and a systematic review conducted in 2009 reported that most side effects associated with spinal ma-nipulation are benign and transitory in nature, and the in- cidence of serious side effects is rare. 224 Based on the most comprehensive review of the lit- erature of the use of manual (principally manipulative) therapies for older patients to date, Cooperstein and Kill-inger 225 opined that not only do older patients not experi- ence more injuries than do younger patients they may actually experience fewer. They attribute this observa- tion to three possible factors: (i) greater prudence by the doctor who may either apply high velocity low amplitude (HVLA) thrusts with less pressure by using a broader sur - face area contact or the substitution of lower force pro-cedures (instrumented adjusting, use of pelvic wedges or other low force techniques) or; (ii) greater joint stiff- ness of an older patient (including the absence of the disc nucleus with age) or; a combination of the two. Further - more, with respect to optimum care planning, Cooperstein and Killinger suggest that practitioners, when confronted with a patient presenting with neck, shoulder or scapula pain consider the interconnectedness of these regions and examine all of them, even if a patient only expresses pain in only one of them. Common chief complaints that may only be ameliorated by addressing dysfunctions of this en-tire region include cervicogenic headaches, thoracic outlet symptoms and scapulocostal syndrome. Similarly, pain in the lumbothoracic region may originate from dysfunc- tions of the pelvic due to gait abnormalities, all of which respond to chiropractic intervention of some kind. 225 In addition to there being a number of low force chiro- practic technique systems that purportedly are safer for use for older patients ( 226 and see Table 3a), the use of HVLA spinal manipulative therapies has yet to be proven more harmful than low-force or no-force techniques and there are various strategies can be employed by practition- ers to minimize any potential risk of harm. If a practitioner is confronted with a patient with mid-back back pain who is severely osteoporotic, rather than attempt to manipulate the patient in either the supine or prone position, during which a fracture could occur due to the compressive forces generated through the patient's body, the clinician may choose to position the patient in either a side-lying or seat-ed position ( 227,228 and see Table 3b). In that manner, the clinician could still provide a HVLA thrust on the clinical target with a greatly reduced fear of causing harm. 227 Conclusion \"Evidence-based medicine is not kind to the elderly. This movement trusts only the products of random- ized clinical trial 55(2) 87BJ Gleberzon of those trials. But subjects over the age of 75 years are rarely found in such trials, thus rendering this population invisible to scientific medicine. If we teach only what we know, and if we know only what we can measure in clinical trials, then we can say little of importance about the care of the elderly. The most important resources required in caring for the old - sufficient time and empathy - are not included in the critical pathways of managed care\" (229p1285) The exponential accrual of the evidence base of chiro-practic care for older patients is certainly encouraging and bodes well for the profession's future. That said, there is clearly a gap in the evidence base of chiropractic geriatric care, with the under-representation of clinical trials of all kinds at the forefront of this gap. Even so, this review found 188 retrievable articles available to practitioners to augment their clinical expertise in order to effective care plan for their older patients, a better than threefold increase from a similar review conducted at the end of the previous decade.Over 20 years ago, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined health as \"a state of complete physical, social and mental wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\" 230 and this resonates well with the holistic and biopsychosocial approach chiropractors champion with their patients with studies of all kinds indi- cating patient are very satisfied with the high-touch low- tech approach that is patient-focused. 231 Furthermore, as indicated by the increased focus of chiropractic care of older patients as evidenced by this review, the profession can align itself with the WHO's definition of \"disease prevention\" that \"covers measures not only to prevent the occurrence of disease, such as risk factors reduction, but also to arrest the progress and reduce its consequences once established\" 230 and health promotion that \"is the process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health.\" 232 Acknowledgement The author would like to thank Anne Taylor-Vaisey for her invaluable assistance in conducting the electronic search used in this study.Table 3a List of non-HVLA chiropractic technique systems by that may be preferentially used for care of older patients226 Instrumented adjusting (i.e. Activator Methods Chiropractic, Atlas Orthogonal) Use of padded wedges (Sacro-Occipital Technique) Drop-piece table (i.e. Thompson Terminal Point) Mechanical mechanized tables (i.e. Cox Flexion-Distraction) Low-Force techniques (i.e. BioEnergetic Synchronization, Network Spinal Analysis, Toftness, Logan Basic, Upper Cervical, Cranial techniques) Table 3b Recommendations to enhance patient safety of older patients judged to be at greater risk of injury during delivery of HVLA adjustments/manipulations 225,228 Increase surface area [thus decreasing net pressure (not force)] through the use of a more broad contact by doctor (flat hand rather than pisiform/hypothenar or thenar) on patient (contact more than one vertebral segment and avoid contacting spinous pressure or transverse processes) Preferentially position patient side-posture or seated to provide thoracic adjustments (thus avoiding compression of thoracic cage) Use drop pieces to reduce amount of force during delivery of prone HLV A spinal adjustments/manipulations88 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) A narrative review of the published chiropractic literature regarding older patients from 2001-2010 References 1 Gleberzon BJ.

To assess the appropriateness of these measures in the patient's follow-up. Methods: Twenty-four subjects (11 men and 13 women) with LE, were evaluated at baseline and after 5 weeks of an experimental treatment. Measurements included: the (1) pain-free grip (PFG), (2) maximal isometric strength, (3) surface electromyography (EMG) of forearm muscle (healthy and affected), (4) a visual analogue scale (VAS), and (5) the Patient Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) (Canadian-French version). Results: All subjects showed improvement in VAS and PRTEE. The maximal isometric strength during flexion and extension of the wrist and the EMG analysis failed to discriminate the affected from the healthy elbow during the initial assessment. Only the PFG measured with the elbow in extension could discriminate elbows with LE from the healthy ones. Conclusions: The use of the PFG with the elbow in extension seems to be the most indicated strength measurement to monitor the recovery of patients with LE. The EMG acquisition protocol used in this research was not adequate to monitor effectively the recovery of LE. (JCCA 2011; 55(2):96-106) k e y w o r d s : lateral epicondylitis, tennis elbow, pain- at the carpi radialis brevis and the extensor digitorum. It is characterized by pain at the external aspect of the elbow exacerbated during extension of the elbow with the wrist in flexion or during resisted extension of the wrist with the elbow in extension. 1 Grip strength is affected and simple activities such as simply taking a cup of coffee may become painful. This is the most common condition diagnosed in the elbow and it af- fects between 1% and 3% of the population. 2-4 Smoking (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1,3),4 forceful work (OR = 3,1)5 and the combination of repetitive movements of the arm and forceful activities (OR = 5,6)4 are associated with the oc- currence of LE. LE naturally resolves over a period of 1 to 2 years in 80 to 90% of cases. 6 It is thought to be a self- limiting condition as pain limits the function of the elbow thus protecting the insertion of the extensor muscles of mechanical stresses during the healing process. 7 It should be noted that the term \"tennis elbow\" is inappropriate because tennis players represent only 5 to 10% of cases, however the practice of racket sports increases the risk of developing LE (OR = 2,8)6 and 40 to 50% of players may develop this condition.8 The term tendinitis is also inappropriate to describe the chronic presentation of this disease because no histological inflammatory reaction has been found in patients treated surgically for chronic LE. 9 The term tendinosis should be utilized preferentially since it refers to degenerative tendinopathy (angiofibroblastic hyperplasia)10 as seen in this condition. Recent literature reviews7,11 have listed more than 40 different treatment methods for this condition. The major - ity of studies reported inconsistent results and no thera-peutic modality seems to stand out or alter the natural history of the disease. Surprisingly, despite the multitude of studies, there is not enough evidence to currently rec-ommend the use of one treatment modality over another. This can be explained by the limited usage (fewer than the half of the experimental studies) of assessment in- struments, with adequate psychometric properties (valid, reliable, and sensitive to change), that limit the power and validity of studies on lateral epicondylitis. 12 The Pa- tient-rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) is a ques-tionnaire that has demonstrated sufficient psychometric properties. 13-16 Since the PRTEE depends on the patient rating of 15 items, there is still a need to find measures that can objectively monitor the progress of patients with LE. Grip strength is commonly measured to quantify the progression of LE. Several variations of grip strength testing are found in the literature. Healthy subjects dem-onstrate stronger maximal grip when measured with the elbow bent at 90 degrees than when measured with the elbow extended. 17 Patients with LE showed no difference between the elbow positions for the healthy arm, while the affected arm showed a significant lower strength when measured with the elbow in extension. 18 An 8% decrease of grip strength when measured with the elbow in flex- ion compared to extension was sufficient to distinguish the affected elbow from the healthy one. These variations have diagnostic implications for both researchers and clinicians. Although maximal grip has an adequate inter- observer reproducibility (ICC = 0.97) 19 many researchers prefer to quantify the progress of LE using the Pain-Free Grip (PFG). 19,20 In addition to the advantageous inter- observer reliability,19 PFG shows a better correlation with common pain scales.20 Since PFG is always measured with the elbow in extension, we decided to compare the two positions (flexion / extension) in order to identify the more appropriate position in which to monitor progress in patients with LE. Electromyography (EMG) has also been used to in- vestigate the function of forearm muscle in healthy and LE individuals. Rojas had identified muscle asymmetry characterized by a decrease of the activation of the exten- sor carpi radialis, a compensatory increase in the activa- tion of extensor carpi ulnaris and higher muscle fatigue index in LE subjects compared to control subjects. 21 A similar study documented a reduction in the activation of the extensor carpi radialis, without increased activation of the extensor carpi ulnaris, or modification of the fatigue index. 22 They also have noted a weakness of the affected upper limb when compared to a control group. Another study was able to compare a group of healthy subjects, a LE group, and a group of recovered LE patients (no pain for 6 months). 23 The EMG results showed a decrease in the activation of the extensor carpi radialis in LE subjects and an increased activation in recovered subjects, despite persistent weakness of the upper limb. The decreased acti- vation of the extensor carpi radialis is in accordance with the pain adaptation model 24 that predicts a reduced ac- tivity of agonist muscles in the presence of chronic pain. 98 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) Impairment assessment of lateral epicondylitis through electromyography and dynamometry Small increases in the level of activity of the antagonist could also be caused by pain. As a consequence of these changes, force production as well as the range and vel- ocity of movement of the affected body part are often re- duced. While this is not commonly used, we believe that the use of the co-activation percentage (ratio of : activity of a muscle acting as an antagonist/ activity when acting as an agonist) should show a modulation of motor activity in a context of chronic elbow pain. According to the pain adaptation model, 24 pain causes a reduction in the activity of agonist muscles and an increase in the antagonist activ-ity which should lead to an increase in the percentage of co-activation. We compared the affected elbow to the un- affected elbow since we believe that this is preferable to between-subjects comparisons done in previous studies. Since the number of adequate assessment instruments for LE is limited, the purpose of this study was to in-vestigate change in EMG and dynamometry of subjects diagnosed with LE to assess the appropriateness of these measures in the patient initial functional assessment and follow-up.Methodology Subjects This study was conducted at the biomechanics labora-tory of the University. Subjects were recruited through an e-mail sent to University employees that were concur - rently enrolled in a project comparing the effect of two treatments on LE. The recruitment period extended from February to April 2007. The subjects were accepted if they met the criteria for inclusions (Table 1). These cri- teria included those frequently used in studies on LE 25-27 and those recommended for the experimental treatment administered (augmented soft tissue mobilization). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University (number ERC-06-114-06.02). All poten-tial subjects (n = 34) during the recruitment period were considered. Five did not meet the inclusion criteria, two refused to participate and three were lost to follow-up so their initial information was not utilized. Twenty-four subjects completed both the initial evaluation (week 1) and the final evaluation after 5 weeks of treatment (week Inclusion criteria Exclusion criteria Having a lateral epicondylitis confirmed by the chiropractor responsible for examination through the tests of Cozen and Mill. 1 Being at least 18 years old.

The initial evaluation included: the Patient Rated Ten- nis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) cross-culturally adapted to Canadian French, 28 a visual analogue scale (V AS), PFG, maximal isometric strength of the wrist and surface EMG. The first half of the group received ten treatments of augmented soft tissue mobilisation (a variation of deep friction massage) for a five week period, and the second received home exercises (stretching of the forearm). One week after the last treatment (week 6), all initial tests were repeated. All the analyses presented in this manuscript are for both treatment groups as a summary, they are not sep- arated (this occurs in another manuscript). 29 Dependant variables The V AS was measured with a scaled line from zero to one hundred millimetres. 30 The question asked was: \u00ab In- diquez par un X to: \"Mark with an X the location on the line below which best represents the intensity of your pain today.\" The PRTEE (cross-culturally adapted to Canadian French 28) with a score from zero to one hundred13-16 was used. This questionnaire provides a brief, uncomplicated, and standardised quantitative description of pain and functional disability. PFG, commonly used to quantify the progression of LE, 19,30,31 was measured using a dynamometer JAMAR model 08940189 (Preston, Jackson, MI), whose dynamic range is 981 N. The test was performed with the subjects in two standard positions: the arm along the body with the elbow bent at 90 degrees17 and the elbow in full extension along with the body (Figure 1). The subjects also received standardized instructions: they were to squeeze the dyna- mometer slowly until they began to feel discomfort. The PFG was measured 3 times, with a 20-second rest interval between each measurement. The results were averaged for better reproducibility. 19 The surface EMG of the extensor carpi ex- tensor digitorum and the digitorum were recorded during maximum and sub-maximal isometric contractions of five seconds in flexion and extension of the wrist. During all EMG acquisition sessions, the sam-pling frequency was set at 1000 Hz. Disposable bipolar surface electrodes Ag-AgCl (BORTEC Biomedical, Cal-gary, Alberta, Canada) were applied bilaterally according Age (years) 46 \u00b1 10 Sex (male/female) 11 / 13 Affected elbow (Dominant / Non-dominant) 13 / 11 Onset of the LE (months) 29 \u00b1 38Table 2 Characteristics of subjects LE : lateral epicondylitis Figure 1 The PFG with the elbow in extension and the elbow bent at 90 degrees100 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) Impairment assessment dynamometry to literature recommendations.32,33 The electrode place- ment site was first shaved and scrubbed with alcohol. The reference electrode (ground) was placed on the olecranon. The subjects were seated, with their elbow bent at 90\u00b0. With their hand initially in a prone position, they were asked to hold a U-shaped handle linked to a strain gauge to measure the maximal voluntary contraction (Figure 2). The subjects had their forearm fixed and were producing maximal flexion and extension of the wrist during verbal reinforcement. The sub-maximal EMG signals of muscles were collected during the hold against gravity of a 5 lbs dumbbell with the hand both in pronation and supination (Figure 3). Each contraction was followed by a two minute pause to reduce the risk of fatigue. Each measurement was made three times on both forearms for comparison. The signals were pre-amplified at the source (gain = 500), to eliminate motion artifacts, before a second amplifica-tion (AMT-8, BORTEC Biomedical). The EMG signals were filtered according to a seventh order Butterworth (bandwidth of 10 to 450 Hz), rectified in absolute values and smoothed (a moving average including 10 points was used to filter the data) to determine the maximal value of each curve. The average of three maximal values was cal-culated and used for each condition. In order to quantify the level of muscle activity, the average of sub-maximal values is expressed as a percentage of the average of the maximal values according to the following equation: % Activation = (5 lb EMG / EMG max) \u00d7 100The co-activation percentage was represented by the EMG activity of a muscle when acting as antagonist expressed as a percentage of when acting as agonist. These percent-ages were obtained using the mean of maximal isometric tasks as in the following example: % Co-activation = (EMG of one muscle acting as antagonist / EMG of the same muscle acting as an agonist) \u00d7 100 During maximum isometric contractions in flexion and extension of the wrist (Figure 2), the strength signals were collected using a strength gauge (NTEP-87-057A3 class III, Artech, Riverside, CA). For each test, the force was recorded at the same sampling frequency as the EMG (1000 Hz) and then filtered in a second-order Butterworth (cut-off frequency up to 8 Hz). The maximal strength was measured in each attempt and the average of the three trials was calculated. Statistics The paired t-test (a = 0.05) comparing the initial and the week 6 evaluation was performed for the V AS and the PRTEE. The two-way or three-way ANOV As with re-peated measures (a = 0.05) on all factors were used to de-termine whether statistically significant differences were present with the other variable. When appropriate, post hoc Fisher LSD test (a = 0.05) was performed. The status of the elbow (healthy or affected) was the independent variable while the PFG, EMG and isometric strength val- Figure 2 Maximal isometric contraction during wrist extension (left picture) and dependent variable. The experiment- al plan of analysis is represented by: A \u00d7 Br for the results of EMG and isometric strength, and A \u00d7 Br \u00d7 C for PFG, where: A has 2 levels represented by the healthy and affected elbow; B has 2 levels respresented by the initial evaluation and the week 6 evaluation; C has 2 levels represented by the position of the elbow during PFG in extension and flexion. Results Patient rated outcomes Patient progress was evaluated using the PRTEE (Can-adian-French version) and the V AS. Table 3 summarizes the results of these two scales. Both the PRTEE and the V AS showed a significant decrease of the score after 6 weeks (P < 0,001) which represents an improvement of the subject condition.StrengthIsometric strength was measured in four specific condi- tions: flexion and extension of the wrist and PFG with the elbow in flexion and extension. Table 4 shows the average maximal obtained. The maximal isometric wrist flexion strength revealed no main effect of elbow status or time. The maximal isometric wrist extension strength during extension showed a main effect of time (P = 0,022), result of a significant increase of strength in both elbows after 6 weeks. This measure of strength showed no significant difference between the healthy and affected elbow. The PFG showed main effects of time (P = 0,021) and elbow (P = 0,014) in addition to an interaction between the elbow and its position (P = 0,011). The post hoc an-alyses demonstrated: 1. A significant increase of the PFG after six weeks in both arms and both positions. 2. A significantly lower PFG in the affected elbows compared to healthy elbow when measured with the elbows in extension. 3. A significant lower PFG of the affected elbows meas-ured in extension compared to flexion. Surface EMGTable 5 shows the percentages of muscle activation and co-activation.

The activation percentage of the superficial flexor digi- torum during flexion showed a main effect of time (P = 0.007), caused by a significant increase in muscle activa- tion after 6 weeks in both forearms. For muscle co-activation, the statistical analysis dem- onstrated main effect of elbow status and/or time only for the co-activation percentage of the extensor digitorum. The co-activation percentage of the extensor digitorum showed a main effect of elbow status (P = 0.048) and time (P = 0.003), result of a significant increase of the co-activation percentage after 6 weeks in both forearms and a co-activation percentage significantly lower in affected elbows. Discussion Patient rated outcomes Since both the V AS and the PRTEE showed significant improvement after six weeks, it is reasonable to con- sider that the subject's LE improved during that period of time. The Canadian French version of the PRTEE has demonstrated good acceptability, construct validity, inter - nal consistency and responsiveness. 28 In 2005, the first English version of the PRTEE , the Patient-rated Fore-arm Evaluation Questionnaire (PRFEQ), was considered to be the most reliable (Interclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) = 0.96; Standard error of measure (SEM) = 1.0) and responsive (Standardized response means (SRM) = 1.0) questionnaire utilized in patients suffering from lat-eral epicondylitis (compared to the Visual Analogue Scale (V AS), the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (DASH), the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey and the Pain-Free Grip (PFG)). 13 In 2005, the PRFEQ was updated to the actual PRTEE to accommodate findings from different research groups and to improve its clarity.15 In 2007, the compari- son of this updated version with results of the V AS, the DASH Questionnaire, the Roles and Maudsley score, and the Upper Extremity Function Scale (UEFS), showed excellent reliability (r 2 = 0.87) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.94).16 SRM was higher in the PRTEE (SRM = 2.1) than in the other outcome meas-ures (1.5 - 1.7). 16 The questionnaire provides a brief, un- complicated, and standardised quantitative description of pain and functional disability. 14 It can be completed in less than five minutes. The use of PRTEE as a standard outcome measure in research may help determine best practice approaches for lateral epicondylitis. Strength In order to quantify the functional capacity of subjects, several measures of strength involving the forearm muscles were used. Measuring the maximal isometric strength of the wrist during flexion and extension seemed Baseline Week 6 Elbow Healthy Affected Healthy Affected Wrist strength in extension 12 \u00b1 5 12 \u00b1 5 13* \u00b1 5 13* \u00b1 Wrist strength flexion 39 \u00b1 17 37 \u00b1 19 40 \u00b1 22 and PFG (kg) Mean \u00b1 standard deviation * Significant increase of the score from baseline (main effect of time, P = 0.022) \u00aa PFG significantly lower than the measure with the elbow in flexion and the healthy elbows (interaction elbow status-position, P = 0.011) b PFG significantly higher than the score from baseline (main effect of time, P = but our results showed no significant difference between the healthy and the affected elbows. Only an in-crease in the maximum isometric strength during exten- sion of both elbows was observed after 6 weeks. Since an improvement of the affected elbow should demonstrate an interaction between time and elbow status, the increased strength of both elbows could be attributed to test-retest effects, because subjects often exert more force in a re- test. The absence of difference between the affected and healthy elbows of LE subjects has been observed in the literature, 22 but the affected arm usually presented a lower strength when compared with a group of healthy subjects. LE typically affects the dominant arm and a decreased strength of the dominant arm could make the strength of both arms comparables. Hand dominance of the subject could be a confounding variable since 13 of our subjects had LE on the dominant arm and 11 on the non-domin-ant arm. Nevertheless, these measures cannot effectively discriminate the healthy and affected elbow (both arms showed comparable improvement even after a significant decrease in pain), they show little interest for initial as-sessment and follow-up in clinical practice. Our results showed an increase of PFG for the two pos- itions after 6 weeks. Similarly to the maximal isometric strength during wrist extension, the increase PFG of both elbows could be attributed to test-retest effects. But, the PFG was significantly lower among affected elbows when measured with the elbow in extension rather than in flex- ion. In addition, the PFG in the extension position was the only strength measure that could discriminate healthy elbows from the affected. The elbow extension, as in the provocation test of resisted wrist extension, 1 put greater stress on the extensor carpi radialis and produces pain at lower grip strength. This greater stress of the injured mus- cles allows better discrimination of affected and healthy elbows. According to this data, the PFG with the elbow in extension is the best measure of strength for the assess-ment of LE in research and practice.

These results are different from previous studies that described a de-crease in the activation of extensor carpi radialis in LE subjects. 21,22,23 The fact that our results did not confirm this difference between healthy and affected elbows could indicate a methodological difference in the EMG acquisi- tion. In previous studies, EMG data were acquired at 50% maximal voluntary isometric contraction during grip, and analysed using normalized median frequency slope as a fatigue index. 22,23,34 Our experimental task carried out during the acquisition of EMG signals during wrist exten- sion combined the grip of a U-shape handle in addition to a resisted extension while previous research only included gripping22,23,34 or a resisted wrist extension.21 It has been suggested that the extensor carpi radialis brevis acts as a flexor muscle stabilizer for gripping during pronation. 35 Combining gripping in pronation and resisted extension could possibly cause an increase activation of extensor carpi radialis during our experiment. Another difference between our methodology and the one of previous studies is that our experimental design did not allow us to assess fatigue index. It is also possible that the lack of difference between healthy and affected elbows is due to the choice of non-affected elbows of the same subjects as a source of comparison. All previous studies used a group of healthy subjects. Our experiment showed a decreased activation of the extensor digitorum of both forearms after six weeks. The co-activation percentage of that muscle is lower in the af-fected arm and increased in both arms after six weeks. These differences are opposite to those we expected under the pain adaptation model 24 since in the presence of a de- crease of pain (V AS) a decreased percentage of muscle co-activation was expected. The pain adaptation model applies to the agonist-antagonist activity of different muscles, and not to the agonist-antagonist activity of the affected muscle. Once again, the increased co-activation percentage of both arms could be attributed to the test- retest effect. The same phenomenon was observed with the superficial flexor digitorum that showed an increase of activation in both arms after six week. One of the limita-tions of our research design is that we have not assessed the test-retest reliability of our EMG protocol. However, we have used a procedure that should increase test-retest reliability: using the average of 3 measures and express- ing the level of muscle activity as a percentage of maximal values (standardisation). Even if Alizadehkhaiyat et al. claim that their EMG procedure is reliable for measuring muscle imbalance in the wrist-forearm-shoulder-chain, 33 they did not assess the test-retest reliability between two sessions.The discrepancy between our results and those found in previous studies 21-23 comes from changes in the EMG acquisition and analysis procedures. According to our results and those from previous stud- ies, the best way to monitor the recovery of LE in both clin- ical trials and clinical practice is to use the PRTEE13-16,28 and the PFG with the elbow in extension.19,30,31 Even if the method proposed by Alizadehkhaiyat et al. seems more promising than our's, future research using EMG data should assess the test-retest reliability of their proto- col before it could be used in clinical trials. Since co-activation percentage of the extensor digitorum, was the only EMG measure that discriminated the affected elbows from the healthy ones in this study, more investigation should be done on co-activation of forearm muscle dur - ing other experimental tasks before it could be used as a clinical or research outcome. Conclusion The use of the PFG with the elbow in extension seems to be the most indicated strength measurement to monitor the recovery of patients with LE. The EMG acquisition protocol used in this research was not adequate to mon-itor effectively the recovery of LE patient. Future research should address the lack of significant difference between the affected and healthy elbows during EMG measure- ment.

Methods: A confidential survey was distributed to the clinical faculty via email. It consisted of several questions polling the demographic of the respondent such as years in clinical practice, and a list of 29 non- musculoskeletal conditions. Clinicians were asked to indicate their opinions on each condition on rating scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Results: Twenty of 22 clinicians responded. The conditions garnering the greatest positive ratings include: asthma, constipation, chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, infantile colic, and vertigo. The options regarding vertigo and asthma, while demonstrating an overall positive attitude towards the benefits of chiropractic care, were stratified amongst clinicians with varying years in clinical practice. Conclusion: This study suggests clinicians at this college are moderately open towards the chiropractic treatment of some non-musculoskeletal disorders.(JCCA 2011; 55(2):107-119) k e y w o r d s : non-musculoskeletal, chiropractic, treatment, CMCC108 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) Attitudes of clinicians at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College Introduction \"I was deaf 17 years ago and expected to remain so, for I had doctored a great deal without any benefit ... Last January, Dr. Palmer told me that my deaf-ness came from an injury in my spine. This was new to me; but it is a fact that my back was injured at the time I went deaf. Dr. Palmer treated my spine; in two treatments I could hear quite well. That was eight months ago. My hearing remains good. \" (1p9) The epochal event in the history of chiropractic oc- curred on September 18, 1895 when D.D. Palmer ad- justed Harvey Lillard's spine with the intent of restoring his lost hearing and, what may be lesser known, is that Palmer's second patient presented with heart problems, a chief complaint that was also addressed using spinal ad-justing directed to the patient's mid back. 1-3 Two features of this well-known story are especially relevant. One is that it was Palmer's intent to restore these patients func- tions via spinal adjusting of vertebrae that were \"racked out of place,\" 4,5 since it is the intention of the practitioner which is often of paramount importance to many chiro-practors 6 and, secondly, the first two chiropractic patients did not present with the types of chief complaints that are typically associated with chiropractic care today. Rather than present with back pain, Palmer's first two patients sought out his help to cure their non-musculoskeletal (non-MSK) conditions. Palmer rationalized this thera-peutic intention using the terms \"tone\" and \"dis-ease\" re-spectively, whereby \"tone\" referred to the intensity of an organ's function as a reflection of the purported vibratory frequency of its associated nerves and \"dis-ease\" referred to the loss of innate intelligence, meaning the loss of the body's ability to adapt to internal or external stressors. 7 Palmer posited that nerves supplying the organs were ad-versely affected when the nerves were impinged by sub- luxated spinal joints, 8 negatively influencing the body's innate recuperative ability to heal.7 D.D.'s son B.J. Palmer continued with this ideological approach, eventually de-veloping the Meric technique system that linked specific spinal segments (vertemeres) to their corresponding end organs or structures. 9 Eventually the Meric Technique system evolved into the Full Spine Specific Technique, a technique system taught principally at the two Cleveland Colleges of Chiropractic today. 9 Over the next century, there has been something of a divergence in the profession with, on the one hand, groups of chiropractors advocating the profession exclu- sively championing a \"spinal health care model\"10 to, on the other hand, groups of chiropractors who maintain the profession ought to pay homage to its vitalistic roots and continue with a more holistic, tonal-based worldview.11-13 And of course there are chiropractors who bridge the gap between these two dichotomous poles, both in terms of practice activities and ideology. Although the concept of chiropractic treatment for non- MSK conditions is controversial, students at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC) are exposed to a variety of opinions on the subject. During their fourth and final year of studies students undergo their internship under the direct supervision of a licensed clinician at one of six clinics across the Greater Toronto Area. Clinicians, who are experienced Doctors of Chiropractic, have opin-ions based upon the accrual of their own education, clin-ical experience and personal ideology and it is possible they communicate these opinions to their interns during their rotation with them, not unlike how clinicians imprint their own personal preference on elements within the core curriculum taught to students during their undergraduate training. 14 In addition, since interns are providing chiro- practic care under the direct supervision of the clinician, and technically are providing services under that clin- ician's certificate of registration/license, it is the clinician who will be the final arbiter as to whether or not care is provided for this or that diagnosed condition at all. Bearing all this in mind, the purpose of this study was to determine the attitudes of the supervising clinicians at CMCC towards the chiropractic management of various non-musculoskeletal conditions. Methods The study was approved by the Research and Ethics Board at CMCC. Survey An online survey using SurveyMonkey was conducted on 22 CMCC clinicians, instructing at any one of the six affiliated clinics during the 2009-2010 academic year. Using a 5-point \"neutral,\" \"disagree,\" and \"strongly disagree\") clinicians were instructed to indicate their opinion on the efficacy of J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) 109J Parkinson, J Gleberzon chiropractic treatment for specified non-musculoskeletal complaints. Each question required a response before the participant could proceed to the next question. (Appendix A) SurveyMonkey is a web-based software program that enables users to create their own web-based surveys and/or questionnaires. An enhanced paid account was made available through the existing license purchased by CMCC. Clinician emails were obtained through re-questing a directory from the human resources depart-ment at CMCC. The emails were uploaded into the survey tool (SurveyMonkey ). Emails consisting of a descrip- tion of the study, as well as informed consent, were sent to the clinicians along with the survey URL. Clinicians were asked to read the description and informed consent form and given an option to proceed with the study, (implying agreement,) or to decline from participation. Clinicians were not asked to input any personal iden- tifiers on the survey. Survey responses were collected using the \"Email Invitation Collector\" (EIC) option pro- vided by SurveyMonkey . EIC allowed the survey tool system to automatically generate unique links tied to a specific email address. Only the recipient knew his/her link. Survey authors and data collectors were not able to see the assigned link inside the collector. As a person re-sponds, only the email was tracked as a status - as having responded/completed the survey. No personal identifiers were linked to any particular survey. Data collection was handled by the authors of the survey who held the license to the \"pro\" account. Confidentiality Clinicians were not required to identify themselves in any way on the survey. Electronic identifiers only included email addresses which were removed from the raw data before analysis by the principal investigators. Selecting conditions The outcome measure was the ranking of effectiveness of chiropractic care for the following list of non-MSK con- ditions: ADHD/learning disabilities, arrhythmias/ECG abnormalities, asthma, autism, bowel/bladder dysfunc-tion, cerebral palsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-order, chronic pelvic pain, constipation, Crohn's Disease, depression, dysfunction of nursing, dysmenorrhea/PMS, eczema/psoriasis, enuresis, otitis media, Parkinson's disease, pneumonia, seizures, ulcers, upper respiratory infection, urinary tract infection, vertigo, and visual disturbances. 15 This list was compiled from the 2001 literature review by Cheryl Hawk et al, 15 which in turn was based on their analysis of the most prevalent non-MSK complaints seen in chiropractic practice. Data AnalysisThis survey was intended to be a descriptive study based on overall trends, means, and proportions with groups stratified by years in practice. Using Microsoft Excel, re- sponses were sorted by years in practice (<10, 10-20 and >20) and analyzed by the number of positive (strongly agree and agree), neutral and negative (strongly disagree and disagree) responses. By graphically examining the data, any observable trends were noted and that data was then analyzed again, calculating the percentage response of each tier. The percentage response allowed for com-parison by proportions. Results Response Rate All 22 clinicians were surveyed and 20 responded, yield-ing a response rate of 90.9%. All returned surveys were sufficiently completed to be used in the data analysis. Clinicians were asked to indicate their year of gradua- tion, how many years they have been in practice, as well as to which ideologies they subscribe. Table 1 is a sum-mary of the population demographics. It was observed that all clinicians surveyed had been educated at CMCC either for their doctor of chiropractic degree or for their post-graduate studies. Of the possible 22 respondents, it is observed that there is a disproportionate ratio of men (15) to women (7). Five clinicians had been in practice less than 10 years, nine had been in practice less than 20 years, and six had been in practice more than 30 years (Table 1). With respect to technique systems, most clinicians re- ported to use Diversified technique. 16 When asked, the majority of respondents subscribed to more than one ideology (which accounts for this total response rate exceeding 100%), with the majority indicat- ing they were functional based (n = 19), pain based (n = 17) and structural based practitioners (n = 11). Of the 110 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) Attitudes of clinicians at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College 20 respondents, two reported they were subluxation based (Table 1). Table 2 depicts the percentage of CMCC clinicians that strongly agree, agree, are neutral to, disagree, or strongly disagree to chiropractic treatment being beneficial to the conditions listed above. More than 50% of the clinicians agreed or strongly agreed that chiropractic could be ef-fective for the treatment of asthma, chronic pelvic pain, constipation, dysmennorhea, infantile colic and vertigo (Table 2). Similarly, strong negative responses (disagree or strongly disagree) were noted for ADHD/learning dis-abilities, arrhythmias/ECG abnormalities, autism, Crohn's disease, eczema/psoriasis, pneumonia, seizures, upper respiratory in- fection, urinary tract infection and vision problems (Table 2). It is also observed that no one condition had a neutral response higher than 45% (Table 2). After analysis of the raw data, Figure 1 represents the conditions listed above that showed high favorable re- sponses toward the benefit of chiropractic treatment. For the sake of simplicity, a positive response was considered whenever the chosen answer was either strongly agree or agree. The number of clinicians that indicated a positive response are depicted, divided into categories by number of years in practice (<10, 10-20 or >20). Because the population surveyed was limited in size, the results were analyzed by percentage proportions only for the purposes of comparison; high percentages are not an indication of statistically significant responses (Table 3 and Figure 2). Using the data from Table 3, Figure 2 graphically displays significant differences in opinion between the \"years in practice\" groups for conditions such as asthma, chronic pelvic pain and vertigo. Positive responses for treatment of asthma totaled 12 out of 15 clinicians who have been in practice longer than ten years, whereas only 2 out of 5 clinicians in the under 10 year bracket gave a positive response. This demonstrates a proportional dif-ference of 40%. In the case of chronic pelvic pain, 4 out of 5 clinicians in the <10 year bracket had a positive re-sponse, compared to 5 out of 9 in the 10-20 bracket and 3 out of 6 in the >20 year bracket. Positive responses for vertigo showed the opposite; only 1 out of 5 in the <10 year bracket but 7 out of 9 (10-20) and 5 out of 6 (>20) in the other two brackets; a proportional difference of 58% and 63% respectively (Table 3 and Figure 2). Similarly, conditions listed from Table 2 with a largely negative response (disagree and strongly disagree) were analyzed; however no clear trends or differences were seen in regards to years in practice. Discussion As demonstrated by this study, opinion on chiropractic treatment for certain non-musculoskeletal conditions dif-fers greatly between individual CMCC clinicians with some congruence due to years in practice and condition. A fourth year intern may formulate their own opinion on chiropractic treatment of a non-musculoskeletal condi- tion, or, depending on the clinicians they are assigned to during their clinical rotations, may be influenced by their clinician's opinions and experiences. Some chiropractors, especially more recent graduates, shy away from treating non-musculoskeletal disorders and instead approach pa- tient care from a musculoskeletal perspective only. Initially the study attempted to correlate clinician ideology with the clinician's attitude toward the appro-CharacteristicNumber of Respondents (n = 20) Graduation Year (before 1995) 10 Graduation Year (after 1995) 10 Years in Practice (1-10 years) 5 Years in Practice (11-20 years) 9 Years in Practice (>21) 6 Philosophies subscribed to/practiced Subluxation-based 2 Pain-based 17 Structural-based 11 Other Patient-centered 1 Biomechanical 1 Outcome based 1Table 1 Demographic respondent clinicians.J Can Chiropr priateness of treating of non-musculoskeletal conditions. However, as the sample size was very limited, the data collected was not sufficiently robust to draw any conclu- sions with respect to ideology. Perhaps not surprisingly, conditions that garnered greater than 50% or higher posi-tive response with respect to appropriateness of chiro-practic management are the conditions that generally have the most supportive retrievable research available for them.

Further analysis of five conditions (asthma, chronic pel- vic pain, vertigo, infantile colic, constipation) was done to observe any trends with respect to years in practice to see if opinions were related to clinical experience. Three conditions demonstrated clear differences between dec-ades in practice: asthma, chronic pelvic pain, and vertigo. From these results, a percentage proportion was calculat- ed. It was noted that asthma and vertigo showed the most significant difference within the stratification of years in practice. Specifically, a high proportion of CMCC clin-icians with greater than 10 years experience indicated a favorable response toward the chiropractic treatment of both asthma and vertigo. Conversely, very few clinicians with less than 10 years experience concurred with their more experienced colleagues. Considering that the litera-ture regarding the efficacy of chiropractic treatment for asthma is equivocal, it is possible that clinicians with less clinical experience rely more heavily on evidence-based literature thus accounting for their low favorable response rate. That said, since the research on vertigo is generally more favorable towards the effectiveness of manual ther - apies (see further discussion below), it was expected there would be a higher congruence amongst all three tiers of experience. Although more experienced clinicians (>20 Years in Practice Response AsthmaChronic Pelvic 3 Proportion of clinicians by years in practice reporting positive responses to selected conditions.01234567891011121314151617181920AsthmaChronic Pelvic PainConstipationDysmennorheaInfantile ColicVertigoCondition Number of Responses<10 Years 10 to 20 Years >20 Years Figure 1 Selected conditions with majority positive responses.J Can Chiropr Assoc Kalirah, BJ Gleberzon years) did report their belief that chiropractic care was ef- fect for vertigo (83% in favor), it is noteworthy that rela-tively few chiropractors with less than 10 years experience mirrored this sentiment (20%). Overall, asthma, chronic pelvic pain, constipation, dysmennorhea, infantile colic and vertigo showed the strongest positive clinician re-sponse for chiropractic treatment. Though research exists for each one of these conditions, the quality of the litera-ture is varied and the strength is debatable. Brontfort et al have recently published a systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of manual therapies for a variety of musculoskeletal and non-mus-culoskeletal conditions. 17 In it, the authors stated that, overall, there is moderate quality evidence that spinal ma-nipulation is effective for cervicogenic dizziness (short term), is not effective (similar to sham manipulation) for the treatment of asthma, infantile colic and primary dys-menorrhea, and inconclusive evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of manipulation for otitis media, hyper - tension, premenstrual syndrome. 17 Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases amongst children causing increased mucous production and airway hypersensitivity resulting in decreased air - flow. 18,19 Chiropractic treatment has been thought to be beneficial in the treatment of this condition as it posited that it may modify the autonomic system and elicit viscer - osomatic reactions to it.18-20 Additionally, it has been hy- pothesized that misalignments at the levels of the upper C-spine create spinal reflexes that can induce asthma and correcting the misalignments could potentially alleviate the symptoms. 19,21,22 In addition, a more recent review by Kaminskyj et al23 reported in their systematic review of the literature that chiropractic care should be used as an adjunct, not a replacement to traditional medical therapy. It is interesting to note that there exists a large positive response (70%) amongst CMCC clinicians with respect to this condition, even though the literature is extremely polar and generally equivocal (Table 2). This incongru-ence may suggest that clinicians consider their treatment to be beneficial for the musculoskeletal symptoms associ- ated with asthma rather than the condition itself. Chronic pelvic pain is described as non-cyclic pelvic pain persisting longer than three months and distinct from dysmenorrhea (a fairly common syndrome causing pain and disability in women). 24 The etiology is considered to be multi-factorial, attributed to anatomical, neurological, hormonal, musculoskeletal and psychosocial factors.24 There has been very little research conducted on the ef-fect of chiropractic care on chronic pelvic pain. One study by Hawk et al concluded that chronic pelvic pain Years 10 to 20 Years <10 Years Figure 2 Positive responses grouped by years in practice.114 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) Attitudes of clinicians at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College is best treated using a multi-disciplinary approach includ- ing spinal manipulative therapy which showed positive short-term effects compared with sham adjustments. 24 This conclusion is supported by the data from this study as 60% of CMCC clinicians responded positively toward the benefit of chiropractic treatment for chronic pelvic pain (Table 2). Constipation is a common condition amongst the young and the elderly. Difficulty and infrequency in the elimination of feces is often accompanied with pain, fear, and discomfort. 25 In a study conducted by Alcantara and Mayer on three pediatric patients, they found successful resolution of the condition after a regiment of spinal ma- nipulative therapy by observing an increased frequency in bowel movements, with less straining and pain. 25 Simi- larly, a case study done on a 64 year old Caucasian female demonstrated a positive resolution to chronic constipa- tion after ten treatments of spinal manipulative therapy. 26 While there is no extensive, high quality research on this issue, CMCC clinicians responded favorably (60%) to- ward the use of chiropractic treatment for constipation. This may be explained by personal experience as refer - enced by the above case studies. Dysmenorrhea, painful menstrual cramps of uterine origin, is differentiated from chronic pelvic pain by its cyclic nature and is grouped into two categories, primary and secondary. 17 Primary dysmenorrhea is not associated with pelvic disease while secondary dysmenorrhea is as- sociated with underlying pelvic pathology such as endo- metriosis.17,24 Hondras et al conducted a randomized, blinded clinical trial concluding that there was no signifi- cant difference between spinal manipulative therapy and sham treatment on the symptoms of primary dysmenor - rheal.27,28 In a narrative review conducted by Spears, the author concluded that dysmenorrhea is best treated by a multi-modal approach including nutrition, chiropractic, medication and other alternative healthcare practices.29 Sixty-five percent of the respondents in this study indi- cated a positive opinion; while this may not be reflected in research studies, clinicians may have approached this question with a multi-modal treatment plan in mind. Infantile colic is an easily identified condition in in- fancy; however its etiology is relatively unknown.30 Ori- ginally defined by Wessel et al infantile colic must meet three criteria: crying for three hours a day, for at least three days a week, for at least three weeks.31 Many in-fants suffering from colic were observed to have cranial and spinal dysfunction as a result from a traumatic birth process and it has also been theorized that colic may be associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction. 32,33 Some chiropractors opine that manipulative therapy could ef-fectively treat infantile colic because misalignments in the spine may be inhibiting sympathetic output. Since an \"adjustment\" theoretically causes sympathetic stimu-lation which, based on physiology, in turn relaxes the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract, reduces peri-stalsis, and inhibits bowel function, infantile colic could be effectively treated through manual therapy 32 A ran- dom controlled study conducted in Denmark showed a 67% reduction in daily crying with spinal manipulation, another study conducted in South Africa showed com- plete resolution of symptoms in 93% of infants in the manipulation group. 33 On the other hand, Olafsdottir et al conducted a blinded, randomized, and placebo con-trolled clinical trial on the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment on infantile colic and found it was no more ef- fective than placebo. 34 Despite the extremes of opinion demonstrated by the research, 75% of CMCC clinicians responded favorably toward the chiropractic treatment of infantile colic. This may attributed to personal clinical experience and/or their choice of what research they have read. Vertigo is a fairly common condition described as a false sensation of movement of self or the environment. 17 Underlying pathologies vary from trauma to infection in the inner ear, or pathological disorders such as ver - tebrobasilar insufficiency or central nervous system le-sions. 17,27 In some patients, the cause of the dizziness may not fall in the above categories, and it is suspected that the cause may originate from the cervical spine, termed cer - vicogenic dizziness. 35 Cervicogenic dizziness is defined as vertigo induced by changes in position of the neck or originating from the cervical region.36 A retrospective study conducted by Elster showed 100% positive response with either symptoms having im-proved or completely reversed within one to six months of care using a treatment plan of upper cervical adjust- ments. 37 In contrast, a review study conducted by Reid and Rivett cited a lack of randomized clinical trials and insufficient clinical research fails to prove the efficacy of manual therapy in treating vertigo. 36 Similarly, Bracher et al observed that a conservative treatment protocol in-J Can Chiropr Assoc cluding spinal manipulative therapy, soft tissue therapy, analgesic electrotherapy and exercise demonstrated a consistent improvement for patients experiencing cer - vicogenic vertigo. 37 However, they also concluded that further studies are needed to assess the treatment valid-ity. 37 Considering that most of the research regarding this condition is positive for chiropractic treatment the results from this study (65%) concur with the literature (Table 2). Limitations This study had several limitations. The clinicians could have misinterpreted the questions regarding each condi-tion to mean whether or not chiropractic care was effect- ive in treating the condition itself or the musculoskeletal symptoms associated with them. For example, condi-tions such as asthma and chronic pelvic pain have been associated with higher incidences of thoracic and lower back pain respectively. 19,24 Moreover, several clinicians did suggest that those individuals exhibiting any of the above listed conditions may have co-morbidities or dys- function in their musculoskeletal systems, making chiro- practic treatment both practical and beneficial. Although clarifications were made about the question to those who asked, it cannot be assumed that all respondents were accurate in their interpretation of each question in the survey. Future studies ought to take greater care in differ - entiating whether a respondent believes that chiropractic care can effectively manage a condition listed, the mus-culoskeletal effects associated with it or a combination of the two. Including the option of \"neutral\" as a possible response was also open to respondent interpretation. Since the sur - vey required an answer for each question, respondents may have chosen the answer \"neutral\" not because they genuinely had no positive or negative position on the mat-ter, but rather because they were required to select an an-swer in order to continue with the survey. Furthermore, a neutral response could be translated as a mixed opinion; in that personal clinical experience has shown some positive and some negative responses in treating the above listed conditions, again not a \"true\" neutral response. It can also be argued that, by responding \"agree,\" \"neutral\" or \"dis- agree,\" a respondent does not have a strong opinion at all. That said, surveys such as the one used in this study con-ventionally collapse \"strongly agree\" and \"agree together and \"strongly disagree\" and \"disagree\" together. In the future, this study may be replicated with the inclusion of an interview component that would clarify reasons for a neutral, \"agree\" or \"disagree\" response. Finally, as this survey study was restricted to the 22 CMCC clinicians of the 2009-2010 academic school year, the sample size was very small, and not all clinicians participated. Had all clinicians responded, the response frequencies would have been different. Bearing in mind the above limitations of the study, the small sample size may have created a skew in the distribution of the results and the attitudes of CMCC clinicians towards the man-agement of non-MSK conditions may not be representa-tive of the attitudes of field practitioners in general. Lastly, it might be interesting to conduct similar sur - veys of clinicians at other accredited chiropractic college and compare their attitudes towards the effectiveness of chiropractic care of non-MSK from those institutions to the ones discussed here. Conclusion Overall, there appears to be a positive response toward the chiropractic treatment of non-MSK conditions such as asthma, constipation, chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, infantile colic, and vertigo amongst CMCC clinicians. It was noted that, regardless of number of years in clinical practice, most opinions amongst CMCC clinicians were congruent with the exception of asthma and vertigo. However, a majority of the more experienced clinicians posited that chiropractic care would be of benefit to pa-tients affected by these two conditions. Both conditions are fairly prevalent in the population and many patients with these conditions seek chiropractic care, not neces- sarily for the condition itself, but for related/associated MSK symptoms. The unexpected result regarding vertigo indicates that research may not play as significant a role as predicted since clinicians with less than 10 years of clinical ex- perience had a low positive response result compared to their more experienced colleagues despite the availabil-ity of literature indicating there is evidence of moderate strength supporting the use of chiropractic in treating this condition. Future studies should be conducted to reveal any in- fluences clinicians may have on their interns. Similarly, CMCC students in years one through three receive a var -116 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) Attitudes of clinicians at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College iety of theoretical knowledge and opinions pertaining to the non-musculoskeletal conditions discussed. A study should be conducted to gather similar data to determine if there is any vertical integration/continuity between the theory taught in class in the undergraduate program, and the opinions formed by fourth year interns. Appendix A Attitudes towards Non-Musculoskeletal Survey This study is designed to determine the attitudes of the clinicians, specifically towards the chiropractic management of a set of non-musculoskeletal conditions. From the results of this study, we will discuss the influence of the clinicians on year 4 chiropractic students and how well that integrates with the first three years of study at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College. 1.

Although the specific in- cidence and prevalence of knee injuries in adolescents that is not sport specific was not specifically reported in the research, it was reported that overall 5% of meniscal injuries involve patients under the age of 15. 2 Currently, there are few published case reports regarding knee injur - ies in adolescents as well as little information regarding the involvement of the coronary ligaments in knee injur - ies. The purpose of this article is to report two cases of knee injuries in adolescents and their management using conservative treatment and rehabilitation methods. Case Reports Case 1 A 16 year old male football player presented with right medial knee pain of two days duration after having been tackled during practice from the left side at the level of his lower thighs and knees. He reported that the force of the tackle was directed at his lower legs and that his feet were planted on the ground at the time of the tackle. He reported that following the tackle he was unable to get off the field due to knee pain. He attended his medical doc-tor the day after the injury and was told he had a medial collateral ligament sprain and was advised to seek physio- therapy, ice, and elevate the leg. He presented to the chiropractic clinic the follow- ing day favouring his right leg due to pain and unable to bend or straighten his right knee fully. He reported that his mother gave him oral arnica on the evening prior to the assessment and that he iced several times over the course of the evening, both of which he felt helped his pain and inflammation. The specific dosage of arnica was not known. He reported that putting pressure over the out-side of his knee and walking tended to increase the pain. He described the pain as being dull with occasional sharp- ness associated with certain movements such as walking or pivoting, ascending and descending stairs, as well as quick movements. He denied referred pain or any parath-esias and rated the pain as 3/10 in the office and 7/10 at its worst on a Verbal Rating Scale where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain he had ever experienced. Past medical history was unremarkable. The examination revealed limitations in right knee flex- ion which was absent for the last ten degrees of flexion and found to be full in extension with pain reported at the end range of both motions. The neurological screen- ing of the upper and lower extremities was found to be unremarkable bilaterally. A focused examination of the right knee revealed no edema or bruising when compared to the left knee. Varus stress testing at zero and thirty de-grees of flexion was negative bilaterally. Valgus stress testing of the right knee at zero and thirty degrees was reportedly painful and revealed a slight laxity when com- pared to the left knee which was considered a weak posi-tive test for a medial collateral ligament injury. Anterior and posterior drawer testing was found to be negative bi-laterally. Apley's compression and distraction test of the right knee produced pain in both compression and distrac- tion (compression portion of test: with the patient prone with knee flexed to 90 degrees clinician grasps calcaneus 122 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) Two cases of medial knee pain involving the medial coronary ligament in adolescents and applies a downward force while rotating the tibia in- ternally and externally to test for meniscal tear; distrac-tion portion: with the patient prone with knee flexed to 90 degrees, clinician stabilizes upper leg above knee and distracts the lower leg grasping the ankle and rotates the tibia internally and externally to assess collateral liga-ments and for meniscal tears). 3 McMurray's test (with the patient supine, the clinician places one hand at knee joint line and other hand grasping distal tibia. With the knee maximally flexed to begin, extend knee with external ro- tation of the tibia; pain or snapping indicates a possible medial meniscus tear) 3 was positive when performed on the right knee. Palpation of the medial coronary ligament of the right knee elicited pain. Based on the orthopaedic testing and history, the patient was diagnosed with a right knee medial collateral ligament sprain, likely a grade 1, and possible medial meniscus tear with medial coronary ligament involvement. A course of therapy consisting of two visits per week for four weeks was initiated and consisted of Transcuta- neous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) and laser therapy to the right medial knee to control inflammation with instructions to ice four times per day for ten minutes. An in clinic and home rehabilitation exercise program was also initiated. The rehabilitation exercises consisted of VMO exercises to strengthen the quadriceps femoris muscle, wobble board exercises including double and single leg balancing and double leg squats, squats, squats with adduction using a ball for resistance, resisted side stepping and the subsequent progression of these exercis-es. For the VMO exercises the patient was instructed to sit with his knee bent and approximately 4 inches from the floor and then to slowly straighten his lower leg without moving the thigh (Figure A i and ii). He was instructed to do ten to fifteen repetitions three times per day. During the first week, the rehabilitation focused on VMO exer - cises, wobble board exercises and simple squat exercises with the other exercises and progressions being added in the second week of treatment. VMO exercises were given with the intention of ensuring the maintenance of strength of the quadriceps muscle rather than specifically treating the injured tissue. After two weeks of therapy, the patient reported that he no longer had any pain unless he was run- ning at full speed doing sprints in practice. By the middle of the third week of care, he no longer had any pain during practice and was cleared to return to play by the team doc-tor. He was at this time provided instruction for advanced wobble board training (one legged squats) at home. He was discharged after the fourth week of care and reported no return of pain and no difficulty playing football. On a three month and 4 month follow up of the patient, he did not report any return of pain or disability in his right knee. Case 2 A 16 year old female presented with right medial knee pain that began 1 week prior to presentation after a fall down the stairs. The patient reported that she \"missed a stair\" approximately 1 month prior and fell down the Figure A i VMO style exercise start position. Figure A ii VMO position.J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) 123K Hudes stairs which at the time caused a small amount of pain in the right knee, but reports that she ignored this pain as-suming that it would disappear in time. She reported that approximately two weeks prior to her visit to the chiro- practic office, she once again \"missed a stair\" and fell but did not have any increased pain immediately. She was unable to report specifically how she landed on her knee. She reported that the pain began in her right knee one week prior to her visit and could not identify a specific cause for the pain other than the two prior falls. She re- ported that she had attended the emergency room a few days prior and that x-rays were taken of her right knee and found to be unremarkable. She reported that she was re-ferred to an orthopaedic surgeon but that the appointment was not for two weeks. She reported that she then went to see a naturopath one day prior who prescribed topical ar - nica to control the inflammation and performed acupunc-ture therapy which the patient reported did not change the pain. She reported that nothing seemed to ease the pain and that walking aggravated the pain to such a degree that she missed a few days of school. She rated the pain as a 10/10 on the Verbal Rating Scale where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain she has ever experienced and reported that the pain was very sharp in nature. Her past medical history was unremarkable. She presented for the examination being carried in to the clinic by her boyfriend and when asked to weight-bear during the examination, required support on both her right and left side. Inspection of the right knee did not reveal any edema or bruising. Range of motion of the right knee was found to be full in extension and limited to 90 degrees of flexion with pain reported at the end range of both mo- tions. There was pain reported on light palpation of the medial joint line of the knee and the medial coronary liga-ment of the right knee. Neurological testing of the up-per and lower extremities was found to be unremarkable bilaterally. The following orthopaedic tests were found to be positive for the right knee: Apley's compression/ distraction, and McMurray's test. The anterior and poster - ior drawer test, as well as valgus and varus stress testing at zero and thirty degrees were found to be negative. The patient was diagnosed with a right knee medial meniscus tear with medial coronary ligament involvement and start- ed on a one month course of therapy consisting of edema control methods, rehabilitation in clinic twice per week as well as a home exercise program. During the first visit, the patient was treated with instru- ment assisted fascial stripping using Gua Sha tools over the right medial knee and coronary ligament as well as laser therapy. She was instructed with VMO exercises as described above. After the pain and edema control meth-ods were completed on the first visit, the patient was able to get off of the table on her own and ambulate unassisted, though with a slight limp favouring her right knee. She was given instructions to ice four times per day for 10 minutes each as well as do 10-15 repetitions of the VMO exercises three times daily to ensure the maintenance of quadriceps strength. During the first week of care she was also given simple squatting exercises as well as wobble board exer - cises to perform in the clinic as well as at home. After the first week of care, she presented to the clinic reporting that her pain levels had dropped to 0/10 and reported that she continued her exercises daily. She was given further ad-vanced squatting exercises including squats with adduc-tion and one legged squats during her second week of care. At the end of two weeks of her four week rehabilitation program, the patient and her mother elected to drop out of care, despite the advice of the doctor to the contrary, as she reported that her pain had not returned. On a three month and 6 month follow up with the patient's mother it was reported that the patient's pain had not returned. Discussion Knee problems and injuries are extremely common in sports and falls. Other disease processes regarding the knee joint such as osteoarthritis are also very common but usually not seen in the adolescent population. 4 One article reported that 30 million children in the US participate in sports and that the incidence of overuse and acute injuries of children has been increasing as the number of children participating in sports grows. 5 The ankle and knee joints were reported to be the most commonly injured joints of the body, with non-traumatic knee pain being one of the most common complaints of the young athlete. 5 Meniscal injury rates have been reported to be 60 per 100,000 with the medial meniscus being injured more frequently than the lateral meniscus. 6 In fact, one study reported the annual incidence of medial meniscal injuries specifically as 60 to 70 per 100,000 people and the male to female ratio is reported to be 2.5-4:1.6 Another study reported that \"medial meniscus disorders made up 37% of overall cartilage lesions found after analyzing 25,124 124 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) Two cases of medial knee pain involving the medial coronary ligament in adolescents knee arthroscopies.\"6 The menisci are firmly attached to the tibial plateau by the strong meniscotibial or coronary ligaments.7 Hammer reports that typically these ligaments are anatomically separate structures although they are seen to blend with the joint capsule, and medial collateral ligament. 7 It is likely that since the coronary ligaments are so closely married to both the collateral ligaments and the menisci, they suffer sprain injuries when damage to either structure occurs.7 When treating medial knee injur - ies it should be recalled that the deep fibers of the medial collateral ligament attach to the medial meniscus which is why these two structures are often injured in conjunction.8 In contrast, the lateral collateral ligament does not attach to the lateral meniscus.8 It is suggested that a conserva- tive approach for meniscal injuries be attempted prior to surgical intervention. 9 The natural history of a meniscal injury is dependant on the type and location of the tear.10 It was reported by one source that vertical tears in the menisci that are located in the well vascularized periphery should not be surgically repaired as they have good heal- ing potential if left alone. 10 Knee pain of acute and chronic nature is very common- ly seen in a chiropractic practice. Diagnosis of knee injur - ies can be challenging as the knee articulation is complex and contains several structures vulnerable to injury due to the nature of the joint as well as the fact that the large muscles surrounding the knee, specifically the quadriceps, are capable of splinting the knee and thus masking symp-toms in some cases. 11 Ligamentous knee anatomy is illus- trated in Figure B and C (reprinted with permission).12 It should be remembered that as there are physical and physiological differences between adults and children, these factors may predispose the younger population to injury, or alter the types of injuries seen in the two popula-tions following similar mechanisms of injury. 5,13 Patello- femoral pain syndrome, anterior cruciate ligament tear, drome, Osgood-Schlatter's disease, meniscotibial sprain, bursitis and muscle strains are all common problems that may affect the adolescent knee. 5,7,14,15,16 In addition, care should be taken to rule out more distant sources of knee pain including referred pain from other origins such as would be seen in a slipped capital femoral epiphysis and/ or other structures including trigger points or nerve root compression. 5,14 Acute medial meniscus injuries often present with a patient history of a twisting injury about the loaded knee joint while the knee was in flexion. 5,14 This may be com- bined with a trauma directed across the knee.1 Symptoms may include joint line pain, swelling, antalgic gait, lock-ing or a feeling of instability, buckling or \"giving way\" and a feeling of being unable to fully extend the knee. 13,16 The swelling or effusion noted is generally of delayed onset and may not be visible until one to three days post injury.16 In contrast an anterior cruciate ligament injury generally has immediate swelling as it is vascularized to a much greater degree than the menisci.13,16 It is interesting to note that the menisci of children under the age of 10 years are resistant to tears as the meniscus is composed of dense collagen bundles arranged in an interlacing pattern Figure B Articular surfaces of the knee joint. A. Extended. B. Flexed. C. Anterior view (flexed) J Can and pliable tissue.\"12 The role of the menisci in the knee joint is to assist in load transmission as well as joint stability.4 In fact, \"the menisci bear between 40 and 70% of the load across the knee; the remainder of that load is transmitted by the dir - ect contact of articular cartilage.\" 18 It has been shown that \"complete meniscotomy leads to tibiofemoral joint space narrowing, condyle flattening, and osteophyte formation\" and one study reports that removal of the medial menis-cus decreases the tibiofemoral contact area by as much as 50 to 70%. 4 Contact stresses in the articular areas are thereby doubled as contact area is inversely proportional to contact stress. 3 Commonly, medial meniscus damage does not occur in isolation as it is much more firmly attached to the tib- ial condyles than the lateral meniscus.7,18 This is also the reason that the medial meniscus is more commonly in- jured that the lateral meniscus.17 Approximately 33% of meniscal tears are associated with ACL injuries.17 Some meniscal tears are asymptomatic and may remain that way or heal spontaneously. 19 Meniscal injuries are typically diagnosed by history and physical including joint line ten-derness, Apley's test and McMurray's test.14,19 However, one study reported that the aforementioned orthopaedic tests are insensitive and non specific for detecting menis- cal tears in ACL-intact knees. 19 In a recent review, Mc- Murray's test is described as being the \"primary test for the examination of knee menisci\" and reports a sensitivity range between 16-70% and a specificity range of 59-98% based on all of the historical research data.3 This review reported the sensitivity range for Apley's test at 13-41% and a specificity range of 80-93%. 3 The review also pre- sented information on Thessaly's test which had a sensi-tivity range of 65-95% and specificity range of 80-97%. 3 Thessaly's test \"performed better than all other tests evalu-ated\" in the review. 3 As this information was found during the research stages of this case study, this test was not con-ducted on the patients outlined in this report. Thessaly's test is performed by the patient rotating his knee and body internally and externally three times each while weight bearing on the leg being tested at 5 degrees and then again at 20 degrees. 3 The following indicate positive test results: discomfort at the joint line, locking or catching.3 These tests may also be present in a knee with injured coronary ligaments. 7 In contrast, coronary ligament injury may be present, and the primary injury, if the meniscal and col-lateral ligament tests are negative and rotational stresses of the tibia are positive. 7 Pain with lateral rotation of the tibia incriminates the medial coronary ligament whereas pain with medial of the tibia incriminates the lat- eral coronary ligament.7 The gold standard in diagnosing a meniscal tear is arthroscopy, however, this procedure is invasive and MRI is becoming \"the imaging modality of choice to evaluate intra-articular tissues of the knee, in- cluding the menisci.\"11 Meniscal injuries usually have lim- ited findings on plain film radiography.13 An MRI of the knee in most cases will reveal an area of increased signal intensity extending to one or more articular surfaces. 13,15 Accuracy rates for diagnosing meniscal tears with MRI have been reported as 90%. 11 As waiting times for MRI can be lengthy, not every case of suspected meniscal tear necessitate referral for MRI and treatment should be initi- ated prior to obtaining MRI results. Cases where locking of the joint occurs should be im- mediately referred for an orthopaedic consultation if the locking cannot be resolved quickly or if locking recurs. Symptoms of medial meniscus tears not complicated by locking can be managed conservatively. Treatment may Figure C Menisci of the knee joint. A. Superior view. 126 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) Two cases of medial knee pain involving the medial coronary ligament in adolescents include: reassurance, custom orthotics, taping, rehabilita- tive exercises, icing, soft manipulation, massage, fascial stripping, non steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, corticosteroid injection, and analgesic medication. 6,7,9,14,20,21,22,23 If conservative intervention fails to relieve symptoms, surgical approach-es may be explored, such as a partial or full meniscotomy or meniscus repair. 4,9 As with other acute inflammatory conditions, bene- ficial effects of icing, NSAIDs, manipulation, and soft tissue treatment including massage and myofascial strip- ping with the intent to restore normal movement have been noted for both meniscal and coronary ligament in-juries. 6,7,14,20,21,24 One study outlined the efficiency of both instrument assisted techniques as well as soft tissue mobilization done with the clinician's hands noting that while the clinical improvements were not different be- tween the therapy groups, improvement in both groups was maintained on a 3 month follow up. 24 While the symptom presentation and history in these cases ruled out patellofemoral pain syndrome, Osgood Schlatters disease, slipped capital femoral epiphysis and delayed onset effusion, and the negative anterior draw- er tests ruled out anterior cruciate ligament tear, the re-maining six conditions stayed on the differential list. No evidence of remote trigger points, nerve compression or involvement of the iliotibial band were noted in either case. Instability was not noted in either case on valgus or varus testing of the knee, although these tests were pain- ful. On initial examination in both cases immediate rul-ing out of bursitis and muscle strain were not possible due to the exquisite nature of the pain. In addition, it was thought likely that some muscle strain about the knee was to be present as it is uncommon for only one structure to be damaged during an acute knee injury. With the symp-tom presentation in both cases of either antalgic gait or inability to weight bear, delayed onset effusion, inability to fully extend the knee, and in case 1 the typical history of a twisting injury about the loaded knee joint while the knee was in flexion accompanied by direct trauma across the knee, it was suspected that the menisci and coronary ligaments were involved. Positive orthopaedic tests in-cluding Apley's test, McMurray's test, and medial joint line tenderness were conducted to confirm this diagnosis as advanced imaging was not immediately available. Previous studies have recommended a course of con-servative treatment prior to surgical referral including icing, manipulation, and soft tissue treatment including massage and myofascial stripping. 6,7,14,20,21,22,23 The pa- tients in these cases were initially treated with either instru-ment assisted or non instrument assisted friction massage at the medial joint line and over the coronary ligaments as well as icing and rehabilitation exercises over the course of four weeks. Rehabilitation exercises included exercises to target the VMO and thereby strengthen the quadriceps muscle, squatting exercises, stability exercises on the wobble board and exercise ball which were progressed to more advanced versions of these exercises to meet the in- dividual patient's needs. Improvement was noted by both patients within the first week of care and return to play was initiated after week 3 for patient 1. No pain remained for either patient after week 4 of care and active therapy was halted for both patients at this time. There are several factors that may have influenced the favourable outcome of these cases. The rehabilita- tion exercises were attempted due to the success of such programs seen for meniscal injuries in the literature. Soft tissue techniques including fascial stripping were used to attempt to break down scar tissue that may have accumu- lated in the area, promote the laying down of more or - ganized scar tissue and decrease edema. 25 With the onset of manual therapy, the patients seemed to have a rapid reduction of subjective symptoms, but it is important to note other factors that may have produced a favourable outcome in this case such as the cessation of playing foot-ball in patient 1 and therefore rest to the affected knee. Further study is needed to identify other possible treat- ment avenues such as specific rehabilitative exercises for injured menisci and coronary ligaments. This research might take the form of other case reports or a small scale clinical trial (RCT) 4 to compare the effectiveness of treat- ment with and without specific exercise prescription or treatment with rehabilitation with and without soft tis- sue treatment. Additionally, the use of other outcome measures for knee injuries such as the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) would be a simple addition that could better quantify the measurement of improvement for future cases or research. Summary Although favourable results were obtained, it is import-ant to remember that the nature of this investigation was J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) 127K Hudes that of a case study, and therefore no inferences can be made with respect to effectiveness of the care adminis-tered in general. The patients in this manuscript may have improved by virtue of the natural healing of their injuries, the rest, ice or perhaps the arnica helped as well. Case studies, while a starting point in the research, are by their nature limited as the protocols were carried out on one, or in this case two, patients. Limited as it may be, this case does suggests that conservative management using rehabilitative exercise, icing, and fascial stripping of two cases of medial meniscus injury with associated coron-ary ligament injury may be helpful. Conservative man-agement of meniscal injuries should be explored prior to more invasive procedures such as injection of corticoster - oids or surgery.

Part I, unearthed the origins, development and careers of Archibald West, the founder of this dynasty, his son Samuel and grandson Stephen. 1 Part II, delves into the life of Archie's brother Samson, and Samson's chiropractic progeny: grandsons David and Neil, and great granddaughter Megan. Then it goes back to look at Stephen West's nephew, R. Ian Buchanan and ends with a descendant of another branch of the family tree, James L. West. Samson J. West DC: Archibald's Brother Frederick and Mary Ann West had 12 children; eight boys and four girls. Archie, the eighth child, was born in 1873, while Samson, the tenth, was born January 3, 1877. Back in the summer of 1881, Frederick West had pur - chased and developed a 300 acre tract of land at the up-per end of Ottertail Lake, in Algoma Township, which he later sold to Samson. Samson was 41 years old, mar - ried to Eliza (Emma) Marshall, with two sons and one daughter when, in the fall of 1918 he enrolled, along with his nephew Samuel West (Archie's son), in the Canadian Chiropractic College (CCC), then located at 22 Main Street West, in Hamilton. Samson attended the CCC for 18 months. His course comprised 12 months of classes followed by six months of clinical training. Formal courses included anatomy, physiology, pathology, spinology, the art of chiroprac-J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) 129DM Brown tic (palpation, adjusting and nerve tracing), chiropractic philosophy and the polemics of chiropractic (logical argu-ments to defend the science and convince sceptics). 2 Sam- son graduated on March 23, 1920. By then the CCC had moved to 757-759 Dovercourt Road, in Toronto. Upon graduation, Samson established a part-time prac- tice at his farm. Patients would come to the farmhouse kitchen, to be adjusted a number of times a day for several days. Around 1922-23, Samson left his property in the care of his wife and children, travelling to the clay-belt area near Ottawa, to open a practice. After a year, he returned to his family in Algoma, resumed farming and practicing there, and probably saw patients at Bruce Mines as well. David West describes his grandfather as \"free thinking. In addition to agriculture and chiropractic he was among the first to install telephones in this area and was an amateur photographer.\" [Interview, David West by Brown, April 5, 2008]. Samson died on February 10, 1960. David I. West DC, and Neil A. West DC: Samson's Grandsons Background Samson and Emma West's second son Mark, was born October 30, 1907. In 1933 Mark purchased the farm from his father and on September 27 that year, he married West Family Tree130 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) The West family chiropractic dynasty: celebrating a century of accomplishment in Canada Helen Harnden. They had four sons; Ian, Alex, David and Neil. David was born July 26, 1942 and Neil on May 15, 1944. In 1955, Mark shocked his relatives and friends by selling the property, which had been owned by the West family for three generations, and moving to Grimsby, On-tario. Helen was well-educated and obtained a good job working in the admissions department of the Grimsby Hospital. Mark purchased a 14 acre fruit farm, which ran in a narrow strip from Highway 8 to the Niagara Escarp- ment and augmented his income in various ways, such as working in the local grocery store. David and Neil's memories of chiropractic go back to their early childhood. Neil relates that when he and David were small boys living on the Algoma farm, their father's cousin Samuel West, would come to visit. Often he would adjust both boys and afterward, give each of them a piece of candy. [Phone call, Brown to Neil West, May 2, 2008] They also travelled to Sault Ste. Marie, where they were adjusted by Sam and his son, Stephen. David remembers that \"father and son were very busy with patients lined up out the door and down the street.\" Education While in high school, David and Neil became patients and friends of Emil Zmenak, DC, a 1960 graduate of the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC) and the only chiropractor in Grimsby, who took them on a tour of the College, at 252 Bloor Street West, in Toronto. David received his senior matriculation from high school in 1963 and was admitted to CMCC in September that year. While there he participated in a number of sports, belonged to the Junior Canadian Chiropractic Associa-tion, the X-ray Club and the Clinic Committee. David admits that \"Probably my greatest personal achievement occurred at the end of my third year at CMCC, when on May 28, 1966, I married Diana (nee Sexsmith).\" [Letter, David West to Brown, September 15, 2009] Neil West also graduated from high school in 1963 but took a detour, enrolling in the Economics program at the University of Western Ontario, where he earned a Bach-elor of Arts degree in 1966. Neil was hired by the John Deere Company and on September 23, 1967, married Lynn Urban. In 1970 he changed vocations, tracing his brother's footsteps to CMCC. Neil was \"a driving force during his College years. He was elected to the position of Executive Secretary in his second year and was President Samson West 1918 David West, Megan 2011; 55(2) 131DM Brown of the SAC (Student Administrative Council) in his last two. He was also active in 'Practichiro' (an annual variety show), as an actor and producer. In 1973 he was editor of the Cornerstone and assistant editor in 1974. His athletic prowess was shown in floor hockey, baseball, volleyball, curling and bowling.\" 3 David West's Professional Career David West graduated from CMCC in May 1967 and promptly opened an office in Grimsby. His practice grew rapidly. Anticipating that his brother Neil would soon join him, in 1972 he built a modern, 4,000 square foot, multi-doctor, well-staffed facility, including an X-ray technician and a registered nurse. The Ontario Chiropractic Asso- ciation (OCA) was curious to discover how he could run such a large operation and still provide competent service. \"Follow me around and find out,\" was David's response. The OCA was so impressed, it used David's statistics as guidelines for developing standards of care for chiroprac- tors in Ontario. [Letter, David West to Brown, September 15, 2009] David's involvement in chiropractic organizations started in 1967 when he was inducted into the Hamilton District Chiropractic Council (HDCC). \"We were fortun-ate to have wonderful peers in the Hamilton/Burlington area, including Drs. Robert Wingfield, David Churchill, Ronald Oswald and John MacRae, to name a few.\" David held all executive positions in the HDCC and chaired the Historical Committee, interviewing a number of senior practitioners, including his uncle, Dr. Samuel West, of Sault Ste. Marie. In 1973, David Churchill, DC, then Chair of the CMCC Board of Governors, invited David to join the College Board. On April 23 that year, David attended his first meeting and was soon chairing the Education Commit-tee. \"With much help from Dr. Herb Vear and Dr. Tom Maxwell, in 1975 we expanded the admission standards at CMCC from senior matriculation to one year post-secondary education. In 1979 these were further extended to two years prerequisite and in 1993 to three.\" [Letter, David West to Brown, September 15, 2009] When CMCC's Bayview campus was opened in 1968, it was designed to house four classes of 75 students. By 1973 the freshman class had mushroomed to 150 students and total enrolment was headed for 600. As Chair of the College Expansion and Development Committee, solving this problem would test David's endurance and ingenuity for five years. In 1975 a three-phase plan was approved that would see the successful construction of three amphi-theatres, various administrative offices, a large technique lab and renovation of the clinic and its associated depart- ments. The last major change under David's watch took place in 1980, when the library was doubled in size by relocating it to the entire top floor of the College's south wing. October 30, 1976, David replaced William S. Baird, DC, as Chair of the CMCC Board of Governors. In July 1976 the Board had begun exploring the complexities of accreditation and in October 1977 started the process by amending its by-laws to allow it to hire a president. By April 1978 the Board was totally committed to accredit- ation and was instrumental in convincing the CCA to form and sponsor an independent agency, the Council on Chiro-practic Education (Canada) Inc. [CCEC]. David describes the decade between 1976 and 1986 as \"a time of transi- tion.\" Others have called it tumultuous. Much of this \"tran- sition\" occurred within the CMCC Board as the College evolved from an organization similar in some respects to a proprietary trade school, to a fully accredited institute of higher learning in chiropractic. Implementing a presiden-tial system of governance was the Board's most difficult task, requiring its evolution from a body deeply involved in administrative matters, to one mainly concerned with policy formation, accountability and fund raising. 4 David West Grimsby clinic132 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) The West family chiropractic dynasty: celebrating a century of accomplishment in Canada On October 24, 1980, David left the Board but main- tained his ties to the College and in April 1982 was elect- ed as the first President of the CMCC Governors' Club, which became an important and still active fund raising arm of the institution. Back in May 1978, as Chair of the CMCC Board, David had attended the inaugural meeting of CCEC, and declared it to be, \"one of the most significant events in chiropractic history in Canada.\" 5 In April 1984, David was made a Director of CCEC and Secretary of its Com-mission on Accreditation and in January 1985 chaired a team that conducted a short visitation of the CMCC clin- ics. \"The CCE board was going through personnel dif-ficulties at the time and as a result, much effort was spent familiarizing ourselves and refining the standards to mesh with the Canadian scene. These were exciting times in chiropractic education and I was fortunate to be a part of it.\" [Letter, David West to Brown, September 15, 2009] David resigned his post with CCE in 1988. From 1975 to1980, David was one of CMCC's rep- resentatives at numerous liaison meetings between the Ontario Ministry of Health, the Board of Directors of Chiropractic and the OCA, attempting to negotiate new chiropractic legislation under the Health Disciplines Act. In 1980 the HARP (Healing Arts Radiation Protec- tion) Act was passed, placing limits and restrictions on the operation and function of X-ray machines in Ontario. Its legislation applied to medicine, dentistry, podiatry and chiropractic, and each profession had its own ad- visory committee. David was an ad hoc member of the Chiropractic Advisory Committee. A critical task was to develop uniform, mandatory, quality assurance tests. The members met once a month for five years and finally adopted a safety code acceptable to all parties. This was a major accomplishment. [Information courtesy of Robert Wingfield] In May 1990 the Canadian Chiropractic Association (CCA) Board of Governors voted to establish national chiropractic practice guidelines and on April 15, 1991, a Guideline Review Group of 25 chiropractors was formed and began critiquing the literature and consulting others in the profession. By August 1992, initial drafts of the Guidelines Document had been completed and distribut-ed to over 23 sponsoring organizations for their input. At this point the Guidelines Review Group was disbanded and replaced by a Guidelines Consensus Commission of 35 members. The Commission's job was to re-evaluate the Review Group's draft guidelines and provide further clinical support for suggested revisions. The work was divided into 20 teams, one for each chapter. David was appointed Team Leader for chapter 15, Maintenance/Preventative/ Supportive Care. This re-evaluation took place over seven months and preceded a four day, round- table conference held at the Glenerin Inn, Mississauga, Ontario, April 4-7, 1993. Here 305 guideline recommen-dations were debated and voted upon in plenary sessions with nearly all votes achieving a consensus level greater than 90% and no minority opinions. \"Three years after the CCA initiated the project, it was finally complete. There had been as much professional participation as possible. More than a few hundred people were involved in shaping the document.\" 6 This made chiropractic one of the first health care professions to have nationally based clinical guidelines in print. Neil West's Professional Career Neil West graduated from CMCC in May 1974 and im-mediately joined his brother David, in the Grimsby clin-ic. Neil`s role as President of the SAC during his last two years at the College, required him to represent student interests at meetings of the Board of Governors and the Senate. In fact, he was present on April 23, 1973, when David was welcomed to the Board. It seemed appropri-ate that Neil, with his background in economics, would join his brother on the Board, which he did, January 19, 1975. In 1975 CMCC began implementing its extensive Ex- pansion and Renovation plans and Neil became David`s unofficial \"executive assistant,\" working and travelling with him extensively, sitting at his side during meetings and somehow finding time to tackle his own project; the creation of a Satellite Clinic for the College at Parliament and Gerrard Streets, in Toronto, a feat he accomplished in less than a year. In 1977, Neil \"chaired a senate study into the development of the various terms of reference and a flow chart of all administrative personnel at CMCC. This has been a commendable task and a very important one for it now gives our administration a foundation upon which to build and develop.\" 7 Neil parted company with his brother in 1979, moving his family to Tecumseh, Ontario, a town on the eastern edge of Windsor. Although this more than quadrupled the J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) 133DM Brown distance he had to travel, Neil maintained his commit- ment to the CMCC Board until his term ended in Febru- ary 1981. Arriving in Tecumseh, Neil opened two solo practices in rapid succession; one in Tecumseh and the other 17 km east, in Belle River. \"When I moved here in 1979, I was the only chiropractor for 30 km along the south shore of Lake St. Clair, east of Windsor. Today there are more than 20. That is similar to the rest of Ontario and represents our strengthening and expanding base...I had a relatively high volume fun practice. My focus was to emphasize my practice and avoid too many collateral activities.\" [Email, Neil West to Brown, April 21, 2010] Actually, Neil had little time for other endeavours. He worked five and a half days a week, spending his mornings in Tecumseh and his afternoons in Belle River. Still, in addition to his involve-ment with CMCC, he held executive positions on the Hamilton and Windsor-Essex Chiropractic Societies and served on the board of the Ontario Chiropractic Credit Union. In 1988 Neil and a partner constructed the 30,000 square foot Tecumseh Life Centre. The Centre contained a four doctor chiropractic clinic, a pharmacy, X-ray, ultra-sound and medical laboratories, medical doctors, dentists, optometrists, audiologists, a psychologist, speech ther - apist, chiropodist and orthodontist. It also offered some- thing unique at that time; an urgent care centre. This was a walk-in clinic, staffed by emergency specialists from the nearby Grace Hospital. Megan L. West, DC BackgroundMegan, the second of David and Diane's three children, was born on May 2, 1972, into a large chiropractic family. Megan relates that, \"It was all I ever knew. I grew up hear - ing stories of my great, grandfather, Samson, farming all day, seeing patients in the evenings, and of Grandma West (David's mother) taking her sons to Sault Ste. Marie for adjustments by Sam West.\" Megan too was adjusted regu-larly and talked to her friends about \"how good it makes me feel.\" Even the teachers knew that the West children didn't have any sick days. One of her happiest childhood memories occurred in 1981, when she \"attended CMCC's Convocation and Dad was the guest speaker.\" Education There wasn't much doubt that Megan would take after her father. Following high school, she selected the human kinetics course at the University of Guelph, because it of-fered full body human dissection and was highly recom-mended as a pre chiropractic program. Megan graduated from Guelph with honours in 1995. By this time it was too late to apply to CMCC so Megan investigated the New York Chiropractic College (NYCC). Situated in Seneca Falls, NY, on 286 acres of land, Megan describes it as having \"an amazing campus.\" In January 1996, Megan was one of 120 students to begin the program at NYCC. Many of her classmates were Canadian. Megan was \"very happy\" with the edu- cation she received, particularly the adjustive techniques. In addition to diversified, she was exposed to a lot of al-ternative methods, which made her \"very confident.\" One member of her class was Anthony Varsalona, an American Neil West 1974134 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) The West family chiropractic dynasty: celebrating a century of accomplishment in Canada citizen who was raised in Branchville, a small town in the northern region of Sussex County, New Jersey. Anthony was first exposed to chiropractic in grade seven, when he injured his chest wrestling. Because he was having dif- ficulty breathing, he was taken to a hospital where all tests were negative. A local chiropractor diagnosed An-thony's problem to be a displaced rib, which he promptly corrected. In grade eight, Anthony became interested in the spine itself and began considering chiropractic as a career. That summer he started researching the profession by arran-ging to observe a variety of chiropractors in their offices. He was also receiving regular adjustments from two lo- cal chiropractors. Following high school, Anthony won a wrestling scholarship to George Mason University, in Fairfax, Virginia, where he completed a pre-med, major biology course. Prior to university, Anthony began exploring chiro- practic colleges. He was interested in the Palmer College, Davenport, Iowa, and the Life College in Atlanta, Geor - gia. He had been accepted by both colleges but a friend told him to check out the NYCC. As soon as he toured the campus, Anthony knew \"this was the right place\" for him, and luckily, he ended up in Megan's class. Megan and Anthony began dating in their second year, graduating together in April 1999. Megan's proud father David, recalls participating in the ceremony. \"At my daughter Megan's NYCC convocation, I was permit-ted to hood her. This was a great thrill for me, with our entire family in attendance.\" Professional Practice By the time they graduated, Megan and Anthony had a good idea of how they wanted to practice. Now they had to decide where they wanted to practice. December 31, 1999, Megan and Anthony spent New Year's Eve with Megan's parents in Grimsby. That weekend they made up their minds to return to Ontario and become associ-ates in David's clinic. On February 26, 2000, Megan and Anthony were married and the clinic's ground floor was renovated to provide them with plenty of space for growth. By June the happy couple had settled into the bustling, well-established, West clinic. [Interview, Megan West and Anthony Varsalona, by Brown, June 21, 2010] Ten years later, Megan and Anthony are raising their bright, energetic, six year old son Colin, in a spacious home perched on the brow of the bluffs overlooking Lake Ontario. They have taken over much of the clinic's ad-ministrative duties and David now works just three days a week. Although their main adjustive technique is still diversified, they utilize Thompson Drop, Sacro-Occipital and Pro Adjuster methods when appropriate. Anthony is Neil Tecumseh Life CenterJ Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) 135DM Brown certified in Active Release Technique and handles a lot of sports injuries. Megan has her fellowship in paediatrics with the International Chiropractic Paediatric Associa- tion, so her focus is on children. The clinic has evolved into a wellness centre, offering affordable, patient-centred, chiropractic care, along with supportive disciplines such as massage and physical ther - apy. Megan and Anthony are adamant that business will never take precedence over public service. Robert Ian Buchanan, Stephen West's Nephew BackgroundIn 1954, Stephen's sister Phyllis, married Stanley Bu- chanan, in Sault Ste. Marie. Stanley was a store manager for Sears Canada, requiring the family moved from city to city across Canada, eventually settling in Toronto. Phyl-lis and Stan sired six children. Their five sons and one daughter were born in various locations. Ian, the young-est, arrived on the scene in 1967, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Ian has memories of his grandfather, Sam West, strid- ing briskly through airports to visit them, carrying a can of Maple Syrup from the Sault, under his arm. In the late 1970s, while living in Vancouver, Ian recalls playing foot-ball in the backyard with three friends, when Grandpa Sam called them into the house and told them to lie down on the living room floor to be adjusted. Ian says he only received upper cervical adjustments from his grandfather. [Phone call Brown, to Ian Buchanan, July 8, 2009] His mother Phyllis recollects driving with her family to at-tend Lyceum, at the Palmer School in Davenport, Iowa, when she was eight years old. Phyllis was impressed by meeting BJ Palmer in his \"Little Bit 'O Heaven,\" an in-door tropical paradise designed and constructed mainly by BJ himself. She was also frightened to be leaving for home on September 1, 1939, the day World War II was declared against Germany, by the Western Allies. [Phone Call, Brown to Phyllis Buchanan, Oct. 3, 2009] Phyllis relates that Sam and his wife May, like their parents before them, were faithful members of what was originally known as the Albert Street Gospel Hall, in Sault Ste. Marie. This evangelical Protestant assembly had its beginnings in 1900, with Archie West becoming one of its first two converts. 7 In 1947, Sam and another parish- ioner donated a new property at the corner of Spring and Wellington Streets, where a larger Hall was erected. After church, Sam and May usually invited parishioners back to their home for dinner, where the topic of conversation invariably got around to discussing the merits of chiro-practic care. Education Upon graduating from Grade XIII, Ian Buchanan applied to study engineering at the University of Toronto (U of T). On January 4, 1986, Grandpa Sam died and the Bu- chanan family drove to the Sault for the funeral. During the visitation, Ian and Brian, an older brother, were up in the attic, rummaging through memorabilia stored there and eavesdropping on the folks who had gathered below, reminiscing about their grandfather. Ian was examining a clock which featured the letters chiropractic in place of the numbers one to twelve, when suddenly he experi- enced an epiphany: \"I'm supposed to become a chiroprac- Buchanan 1997136 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) The West family chiropractic dynasty: celebrating a century of accomplishment in Canada tor!\" he shouted, and quickly changed his courses at the U of T to comply with CMCC's requirements. From 1986-88, Ian completed the first two years of a three year BSc program before leaving for Jerusalem to pursue his interest in Old Testament historical geography. Returning to the U of T in 1989, Ian earned his BSc be-fore enrolling at CMCC, where he graduated in 1994. Although initially surprised by the content of the course, which emphasized the science of chiropractic, rather than the philosophical aspects he was expecting, Ian found his four years at College to be \"a great experience.\" One of his most memorable recollections is falling in love with fellow classmate Leslie Aldcorn. Leslie and Ian had something in common: they were both born in Winnipeg. At this time Leslie was living in Markham, Ontario. Her father Gary, was a professional hockey player who had skated on left wing for a number of leagues including the National Hockey League, where he toiled for Boston, De-troit and Toronto. Professional Careers Because Leslie and Ian had spent much of their youth in western Canada, both wanted to practice in a western province once they graduated. During the summer break of 1993, they began their search. Starting in Vancouver, British Columbia, the couple kept moving east, until they landed in Lethbridge, Alberta, which they found the most welcoming. In July 1994, before moving out west, Ian proposed to Leslie in front of the Palmer Homestead, on Old Simcoe Street, in Port Perry, Ontario. They were mar - ried on December 30 that year and now (2010), have two lovely children, Meghan 12 and Quinn 10. Although they began their careers as associates in separate offices, since 1997 Ian and Leslie have practiced together in their own 3,400 sq ft clinic. For a few years Ian had an auxiliary office in Pincher Creek, south-west of Lethbridge, until the main clinic be-came too demanding. Recently the Lethbridge Clinic has been modernized. The office is now paperless and three massage therapists share the premises, although Ian and Leslie still take their own X-rays, use no modalities and the primary adjustive technique remains diversified. Sixteen years later, Leslie and Ian are still motivated by Grandpa Sam, in that they use spinal adjustments, by hand only and practice the \"Golden Rule,\" with afford-able fees and a schedule that meets their patients' needs.James L. West, DC BackgroundJames West's lineage goes back to Stephen West (1815- 1889), the first family member to settle in Ontario. Stephen West and his wife Mary Ann had 11 children. Frederick West, their fifth child, was the father of Archi-bald West, the first of four generations of chiropractors previously discussed in Part I of these two papers. James West comes from a separate branch of the family. His great grandfather Herbert West was the tenth child of Ste- phen West and Frederick was his brother. (See the West Family Tree) James' father, Lorne West, was born on a farm near Sault Ste. Marie in 1936. His family received chiroprac-tic care from Samuel West and attended the Albert Street Gospel Hall. In 1946, Lorne's father Charles died sud- denly, leaving his mother Dorothy with seven young chil- dren to feed. Members of the Gospel Hall offered to adopt the children and Sam said he would look after Lorne, who was a much younger second cousin. However, his mother didn't want to break up the family and determined to raise the children herself. In 1954, Lorne left his job at Algoma Steel and moved to Toronto, to stay with a sister who was studying to become a Victorian Order Nurse. The year after, he joined the North York Fire Department, where he became a Captain and served for 25 years. In 1955 Lorne married Beverley Baker and they had five sons, who pro- duced 22 grandchildren, 11 boys and 11 girls. [Lorne West interview by Brown, August 12, 2010] Education James, the first child, was born in Toronto, Ontario, April 29, 1957. He always excelled academically, achieving his Grade XIII diploma with the second highest marks in the Region of York. After high school James studied neuro-sciences at the U of T, on a full academic scholarship. He already knew he wanted to be a chiropractor because of his personal experience and the stories his father had told him about Samuel West. \"In the Sault, Sam was as influ- ential as the mayor ... He had a large practice, was always on the move and known for his generosity ... Sam was an elder in the Gospel Hall and spoke a lot. Some people thought he was the pastor.\" James' teachers at the University knew he wanted to be a chiropractor and he \"took a lot of flack for it.\" When J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) 137DM Brown he approached one of his professors for a letter of recom- mendation to the College, James was told he was making a big mistake; throwing his life away. Although this was intimidating, he wasn't deterred. While at CMCC (1977-81) James supported himself as a part-time paramedic for the Ontario Ministry of Health and in his third year he assisted Donald Hender - son (CMCC 1975) with the emergency care program. In his third and fourth years he worked as a lab technician for John Duckworth, MD, CMCC's illustrious Professor of Anatomy. \"This wasn't a job, it was an opportunity, a magical experience.\" Despite this heavy schedule, James graduated first in his class, winning the top academic awards. [James West interview by Brown, August 12, 2010] Professional CareerIn 1980, a year before graduation, James purchased a bun-galow on a half acre lot, fronting on Highway 7, at Ken-nedy Road in Unionville, which he converted into a home/office combination. A couple of years later he renovated the lower level and installed a 2,000 sq ft clinic. Next he had the property rezoned commercial, enlarged the first floor and added a second floor, where his parents conduct the retail side of Almira Fine Furniture, a prosperous en-terprise they have owned for 30 years. Although CMCC thoroughly grounded him academic- ally, James thinks he was overly optimistic about his fu-ture success in private practice because, like Megan West, he \"knew nothing about business.\" James rectified this by taking courses in practice management and shared this in-formation by lecturing widely on the subject of \"patient care and retention,\" throughout North America from 1994 to 2007. James firmly believes in continuing care. \"Most patients come to our clinics because they are seeking reso-lution of a symptom. If all we do is alleviate that symp-tom...I feel we have done the patient a great disservice...Through education, patients should experience a shift in their thinking away from simply symptomatic relief to the benefits of long-term chiropractic management. 9 James has also appeared frequently as a guest on CFRB radio and CBC TV, speaking about the prevention and correction of spinal injuries and the benefits of spin- al maintenance. For a number of years James has hired CMCC students to work part-time in his clinic. His goal is to instil confidence, by providing them with professional advice, clinical training, business acumen and respect. When he started practice, James used diversified, full spine adjusting. Gradually, he has evolved to Activator methods, in which he is certified, but still employs the static and motion palpation skills he was taught in Col-lege, for spinal analysis. In 2007, James converted his whole office to the latest generation of Impulse TM ad- justing instruments, which he describes as electronic im-pulse adjusting. He finds this technique quite effective, particularly for patients in acute pain who cannot tolerate excessive force. James is \"convinced there are fundamentally two fac- tors which make chiropractors unique, and therefore valu-able, in the healthcare marketplace. The first is WHAT we treat - Vertebral Subluxation. The second is HOW we treat it - Spinal Adjustment. Diagnosing and correcting vertebral subluxations with spinal adjustments, and the continued performance of this distinct service, are keys to preserving our chiropractic identity.\" James West 2007138 J Can Chiropr Assoc 2011; 55(2) The West family chiropractic dynasty: celebrating a century of accomplishment in Canada Summary Considering the West chiropractic family's hundred year odyssey in the field of health care, it appears that much of the success Canadian chiropractors now enjoy, particu- larly in Ontario, emanated from the vision, initiative and courage of Archibald West. Archie began the journey in 1908, when he returned from a rigorous 530 km trip to Plainwell, Michigan, with WJ Robbins in tow and con-vinced him to open the Robbins Chiropractic Institute, in Sault Ste. Marie. That first bold step ensured that Archie would become a chiropractor and enabled stalwarts such as John Henderson, Albert Price and Sam Sommacal, to do likewise. The RCI was short-lived, however in 1914 Henderson helped establish its successor, the Canadian Chiropractic College, in Hamilton. This made it easier for Samson and Samuel West to emulate Archie and opened the door for other notables like John Clubine and Arthur Kennedy to join the profession. By 1919 the CCC had moved to Toronto and closed in 1923. In the meantime, John Clubine and John Cudmore had formed the Toronto Chiropractic College (TCC). Clu-bine was President of the TCC until its demise in 1926. A few of its memorable alumni were AB Bennett, Her - bert Hill, JA Hetherington, HO Langford, Fred Lewis and Harry Yates. From 1927 to 1945, no recorded chiropractic colleges existed in Canada. On January 10, 1943, the CCA decided to create a national chiropractic college in Toronto, which would be called the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College. Archie West's influence was felt immediately through the presence of Clubine who attended the inaug- ural meeting, and reinforced when Henderson, Sommacal and Arthur Kennedy's son Keith, were appointed to the Organization Committee. In 1944, Sam West was success-ful in getting his colleagues to pledge the money needed to pay for our Bloor Street property, contributing a sub- stantial sum himself. When CMCC opened on September 18, 1945, Clubine was the College's first President, Hen-derson its first Registrar and Sommacal would become its third President, 1947-51. When CMCC's first graduating class obtained their diplomas in 1949, Fred Clubine, nephew of John Clubine, Glen Kennedy, another son of Arthur Kennedy and James Langford, son of HO Langford, were among the recipi-ents and in 1950, the second graduating class included Denny Bennett, son of AB Bennett and Stephen West, who justified his father's faith in him by serving the pro- fession diligently in a variety of roles, for 49 years. Archibald B. West is known as the founder of the West Family Chiropractic Dynasty. He also deserves to be rec-ognized and honoured, as the founder of chiropractic edu-cation in Canada.

Thermal patterns and health perception. JCCA. 2007; 51(2):106-111. In the paper Thermal patterns and health perception,1 an analysis error occurred. Briefly, our study involved 68 subjects, each of whom had 3 consecutive thermal scans at weekly intervals. At each visit, readings from each side of the spine (left and right channels), and the difference between sides (delta channel) were obtained. Thermal pattern percents were estimated by comparing Visits 1 and 2 (PP1), and Visits 2 and 3 (PP2). Participants also completed the SF-12 survey on each visit, from which physical and mental component summaries (PCS and MCS) were derived as outcomes. In our original analysis, the data were organized so that subjects' PP1 readings were aligned with their outcome scores from Visit 2 while their PP2 readings were aligned with their outcome scores from Visit 3. However, we erred by analyzing the 68 \"paired\" (PP1 and PP2) scores as if they had been originated from 136 independent subjects. We also dichotomized the PP scores, then compared out- comes between \"high\" and \"low\" groups, again without recognizing the \"within-subjects\" pairing of the data. The Correction here is based on converting paired ob- servations to independent summary scores. We used the average of the 2 thermal pattern percents (PP1 and PP2) for each channel and the average of the Visit 2 and Visit 3 outcome scores for each participant. We then estimated the correlation between average thermal pattern percent and average (of 2 separately-timed) PCS and MCS scores. This way, all analyses were correctly based on only 68 independent observations. In pattern theory, increased thermal pattern percent is considered unhealthy and indicative of a nervous system with diminished adaptive capabilities. For the outcome variables, PCS and MCS, higher scores signify better health. A total of 6 Pearson correlations were estimated (between pattern percent and each of 2 outcomes, for each of 3 thermal channels). As one outcome variable (MCS) lacked a normal distribution, a nonparametric statistic was used (Spearman test). We found no correlation between average pattern per - centages and PCS measurements (all Pearson r values < 0.100; all 2-tailed P values > 0.45). We found weak, but near-significant, inverse correlations between average pattern percentages and MCS scores: left channel Spear - man's rho (r s) -0.206 (95% CI: -0.422 to (95% CI: -0.433 to 0.023, P -0.206 (95% CI: -0.423 to 0.035, P = 0.09). Contrary to our original analysis,1 these results show that pattern percentages are not correlated with health status as assessed by the SF-12 PCS. Similar to our ori- ginal analysis, we found nearly significant correlations of otherwise trivial magnitude between higher pattern per - centages (poorer health status according to pattern theory) and poorer mental health status as assessed by the SF- 12 MCS. Specifically, all estimated correlations between pattern percentage and MCS score were approximately 0.2, conventionally meaning weak to negligible correla- tion. Upon examining the 95% confidence intervals for r s, the most extreme value was -0.43 (lower bound for delta channel), indicating that, at best, a weak-to-moderate cor - relation was compatible with the data.
