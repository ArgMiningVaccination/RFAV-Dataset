Last but not least, I would like to thank Mauro for his love, support and patience. Your smile and laughter gives light to every day. XISummary Despite major reductions since the year 2000, malaria is still a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years of age, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that children with severe malaria receive immediate treatment with parenteral antimalarial medication, followed by a three-day treatment course with an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). However, many cases of severe malaria happen in areas where injections are not available. To reduce the mortality of these children, the WHO recommends rectal artesunate (RAS) as a pre-referral treatment for children under six years with fever and danger signs indicative of severe malaria. So far, this recommendation came with limited operational guidance. The \"Community Access to Rectal Artesunate for Malaria\" (CARAMAL) project aimed to generate evidence on the operational aspects of implementing and scaling up RAS. Within this context, understanding treatment-seeking and case management practices contributes to identifying inefficiencies within the continuum of care for severe malaria, eventually showing the need for supportive interventions accompanying the implementation of RAS. The aim of this thesis was to investigate treatment-seeking and case management practices for suspected severe malaria in children under five years in three diverse settings in sub-Saharan Africa, and to evaluate the implications of these practices for the implementation of RAS. Children attending a community health worker (CHW) or primary health centre (PHC) in three health zones in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), three Local Government Areas in Adamawa State in Nigeria, and three districts in Uganda were enrolled if they presented to a community-based provider with fever and danger signs. Eligible children were followed up 28 days post-enrolment to assess their final health outcome, treatment-seeking and case management history. Referral completion to a designated referral facility ranged from 48% in Nigeria to 67% in DRC. There was evidence that the administration of RAS may have negatively affected referral completion to designated referral facilities in DRC and among children attending a PHC in Nigeria. In Uganda, children who completed referral were more likely to receive appropriate post-referral treatment for malaria (treatment completion with an ACT) than children pursuing alternative treatment-seeking pathways or children who were not brought to any post-referral provider. Yet, alternative post- referral treatment-seeking pathways often also led to appropriate treatment. Inappropriate post- XIIreferral treatment was particularly a problem in Nigeria where none of the children completing referral to a designated referral facility were administered an ACT at the facility. Even though the situation presented better in DRC and Uganda, there was evidence that a considerable number of children did not complete malaria treatment with an ACT. This finding is concerning considering that the emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance in sub-Saharan Africa is now factual. The case fatality rate (CFR) of children with suspected severe malaria initially seeing a community- based provider ranged from 0.5% in Uganda to 12% in Nigeria. The administration of RAS was not associated with a higher chance of survival, but reduced death or illness 28 days after enrolment in Uganda. Meanwhile, the administration of injectable antimalarials and ACTs had a positive effect on health outcomes in all project countries. Referral completion was associated with better health outcomes only in Nigeria. The CFR was particularly high among children attending a PHC in Nigeria (19%). RAS did not prove to be effective in reducing deaths in any project country due to underlying shortfalls in the health systems. Because RAS has already been scaled up in many sub-Saharan African countries, future guidance on RAS needs to focus on mitigating the risks of the potentially negative effect of RAS administration on referral completion, with consequences for the quality of post- referral treatment and health outcomes. More generally, there is a need to strengthen appropriate post-referral treatment seeking; yet, with respect to local treatment-seeking practices leading to appropriate malaria case management, which may include providers outside of the public health system. However, disease-specific interventions often lack sustainability and only benefit the target population of the intervention. In contrast, strengthening the health system could lead to more equitable access to healthcare in the long-term, improving treatment seeking and case management of children with severe malaria and other severe febrile illnesses often mistaken for severe malaria. However, funding for health system strengthening is often allocated to interventions supporting single functions of the health system, which is less sustainable and has less broad impact. In addition, the active role of the population as a co-producer of health is often ignored in research and policymaking, subjecting people to passive recipients of health services. To effectively improve access to healthcare, equal attention has to be given to demand-side and supply-side determinants of access. The historical and present efforts against malaria show that major progress in the future is only realistic if built on the solid ground of strong health systems and through strategies beyond technical solutions. Even though this conclusion is not new, the problem of weak health systems in malaria- endemic countries has not been adequately addressed in the past. Unless health budgets are increased, XIIIthe aim of preventing malaria cases and deaths in the short-term contradicts the long-term goal of building stronger health systems.

XXChapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Malaria: a public health perspective Malaria is an ancient disease and has co-evolved with the human species for at least 3000 years (Cox 2010). The disease may be responsible for half of the deaths of all the people that ever lived (Whitfield 2002). Today, malaria is a preventable and curable disease; however, it continues to contribute significantly to the global disease burden. In 2019, malaria was the fifth leading cause of the global disease burden in children below the age of 10 years (GBD 2019 Diseases and Injuries Collaborators 2020). In the same year, there were an estimated number of 229 million malaria cases and an estimated number of 409,000 malaria deaths (World Health Organization 2020b). Approximately 94% of the malaria cases occurred in the World Health Organization (WHO) African region. Meanwhile, a massive scale up of malaria control interventions has led to substantial declines in the malaria burden since 2000 (Bhatt et al. 2015). Between 2000 and 2015, the global malaria incidence rate decreased by 27% and the malaria mortality rate more than halved. However, between 2015 and 2019, the momentum of decline has slowed. In this time period, malaria incidence decreased by less than 2% (World Health Organization 2020b). Additionally, the growing world population has led to an increase in the population at risk. Thus, the absolute number of malaria cases has remained approximately the same since 2000. Reducing the malaria burden would come with major public health and economic benefits; by reducing health expenditures at both the household and health system level, improving the health of affected individuals and populations, and opening opportunities for development (Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on the Economics of Antimalarial Drugs et al. 2004). This thesis aims to contribute to the reduction of the malaria burden by presenting opportunities for improved case management of severe malaria in children. 1Chapter 1. Introduction 1.2 Transmission of malaria Malaria is a vector-borne disease caused by parasitic protozoa of the genus Plasmodium . The parasites are transmitted from human to human by female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles . The life cycle of the parasite inside the human host consists of an initial liver stage followed by replication cycles in the blood. Inside liver and blood cells, the parasite replicates asexually. At the end of an asexual replication cycle, the infected cells rupture and release merozoites that infect new blood cells. To continue transmission, some parasites evade the asexual replication in the blood and differentiate into sexual stages (gametocytes). Gametocytes are ingested by female Anopheles mosquitoes during a blood meal. Inside the mosquito, the parasite undergoes sexual reproduction, at the end of which sporozoites migrate into the salivary glands of the mosquito and are inoculated into a new human host. ThePlasmodium genus is comprised of more than 150 species that can infect reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals. However, only five species cause malaria in humans: Plasmodium falciparum , Plasmodium knowlesi . Plasmodium falciparum is predominant in Africa and is the primary contributor to malaria morbidity and mortality worldwide (World Health Organization 2018b). Plasmodium vivax is the geographically most widespread Plasmodium species and is responsible for the second largest number of malaria cases and deaths. It contributes significantly to the malaria burden in South-East Asia, the Middle East and the Western Pacific, and is the predominant species in Central and South America (Battle et al. 2019; World Health Organization 2018b). Vivax malaria has long been considered benign; however, more recently, reviews of historical and contemporary evidence demonstrated that a diagnosis with Plasmodium vivax bears a similar risk of severe illness and death compared to a diagnosis with Plasmodium falciparum (Baird 2013; Naing et al. 2014). The other three species causing malaria in humans add substantially less to the global malaria burden. 1.3 Progress in reducing the malaria burden In 2020, two targets of the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030, namely to reduce malaria case incidence and mortality rates by 40% compared to 2015, were not met (World Health Organization 2021a). The failure to meet these targets was contrasted by the successful interruption of malaria transmission in 10 countries between 2015 and 2020, and the prevention of re-establishment of malaria in all countries that had been malaria-free in 2015. Realizing that 2Chapter 1. Introduction substantial reductions of the malaria burden, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, can only be achieved with a stronger focus on moderate to high transmission areas, the WHO launched the \"high burden to high impact\" initiative. The \"high burden to high impact\" initiative is a country-led response in 11 countries bearing approximately 70% of the world's malaria burden: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ghana, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania and India (World Health Organization and Global Malaria Programme 2019). The key elements of the response are the translation of political commitment into resources and action, the use of quality data for targeting interventions, constant improvement of global guidance, and a coordinated national malaria response both within the health sector and across sectors. The response focuses on reducing malaria mortality while ensuring that progress towards targets to reduce malaria cases remains on track. Together with the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030, the response calls for moving away from a \"one-size-fits-all\" strategy to a more tailored response adapted to local settings. The realization that national and sub-national heterogeneity requires adaptions of malaria control measures is not new. In 1969, the final report of the Malaria Eradication Program stated that \"each country [. . . ] poses a different problem, the solution of which requires in each case a different approach. It may be remarked here that [. . . ] the problem has only affected part of the country [. . . ].\" (World Health Organization 1969). 1.4 Malaria control Reducing the malaria burden is achieved through a combination of interventions adapted to local settings and, more generally, economic development (Sachs and Malaney 2002). Active measures to control malaria can be categorized into efforts aiming at the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malaria. 1.4.1 Malaria prevention Interventions recommended for the prevention of malaria in humans include vector control interventions, housing improvements, chemoprevention, and the newly recommended malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 (World Health Organization 2021d; World Health Organization 2021e). The core vector control interventions are insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) (World Health Organization 2019a). Between 2000 and 2015, large-scale deployment of ITNs and IRS contributed 68% and 13% of the decline in P. falciparum prevalence, respectively (Bhatt 3Chapter 1. Introduction et al. 2015). To reduce morbidity and mortality, the WHO recommends a high coverage with only one core intervention. The second core intervention may be implemented once high coverage with the first intervention has been attained in order to prevent, manage and mitigate insecticide resistance. An additional vector control intervention is larval source management aiming at the reduction of the replication of malaria vectors (World Health Organization 2021d). Possible strategies include larviciding, modifications of the environment that reduce the number of breeding sites, and biological control through the introduction of natural mosquito predators into water bodies. The WHO also lists housing improvements as a vector control intervention. Housing modifications that contribute to malaria preventions are all structural changes that prevent mosquitoes from entering and/or decrease the exposure of inhabitants to vectors (World Health Organization 2021d). Examples for housing improvement that affect malaria transmission range from changes in structural design and building materials to modifications made to existing homes, such as window screening. The recommended chemoprevention interventions are intermittent preventive treatment for pregnant women (IPTp) and infants (IPTi), and seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) for children under 6 years in moderate to high transmission areas in sub-Saharan Africa (World Health Organization 2021d). While IPTp and IPTi are recommended in areas with seasonal and perennial transmission, the recommendation for SMC is limited to areas with highly seasonal transmission in the Sahel zone. In previous studies, IPTp with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) reduced the risk of maternal anaemia, low birthweight and neonatal mortality (Eisele et al. 2012; Wilson et al. 2011). IPTi with SP decreased the occurrence of clinical malaria and anaemia, and reduced hospital admissions with malaria parasitaemia in infants (Aponte et al. 2009). Meanwhile, SMC may prevent up to 75% of clinical and severe malaria episodes and is associated with a reduced risk of anaemia and all-cause mortality in children (Meremikwu et al. 2012). Very recently, the WHO recommended the vaccine RTS,S/AS01 for widespread use among children in sub-Saharan Africa and other areas of moderate to high P. falciparum transmission (World Health Organization 2021e). RTS,S/AS01 was tested in a phase 3 randomized controlled trial in seven countries in sub-Sahara Africa and reached a maximum of 36% protective efficacy against clinical malaria and a 32% protective efficacy against severe malaria (RTS,S Clinical Trials Partnership 2015). The recommendation of widespread use followed a pilot study in Ghana, Kenia and Malawi, which found that RTS,S/AS01 is feasible to deliver, safe, and increases equity in access to malaria prevention (World Health Organization 2021e). 4Chapter 1. Introduction 1.4.2 Malaria diagnosis Diagnostic testing reduces the overuse of antimalarials, improves the identification of other diseases, and provides the basis for a strong surveillance system to inform the implementation of targeted malaria interventions (World Health Organization 2011). Diagnostic methods commonly applied in clinical settings are light microscopy and antigen-detecting malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDT). Usually, microscopy is used to identify the parasite species causing infection. The most commonly used mRDTs either detect P. falciparum only, or they distinguish between a P. falciparum infection and an infection caused by one of the other four human-infecting malaria parasites. The wide-scale availability of inexpensive mRDTs was the prerequisite for the implementation of a test-and-treat strategy by the WHO in 2010 to improve the rational use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) (World Health Organization 2010a). Since then, mRDT sales have increased from less than 100 million tests to over 300 million, and diagnostic testing of children with fever has more than doubled (World Health Organization 2020b). However, antimalarials continue to be administered to children without prior testing or to children with a negative test result (Burchett et al. 2017; Johansson et al. 2015). In malaria-endemic settings, febrile illnesses are often wrongly diagnosed as malaria because the clinical features of malaria are non-specific (White et al. 2014). Another reason for the overdiagnosis of malaria is the inability of mRDTs to detect active infections of malaria. Unlike microscopy that detects life blood stage infections, mRDTs detect antigens of the malaria parasite which may remain in the blood for several weeks after the infection has been cleared by an antimalarial drug (Dalrymple et al. 2018). An additional concern for the effectiveness of mRDTs is the emergence and spread of P. falciparum parasites with deletions of genes coding for histidine-rich protein 2, the main target antigen of mRDTs (World Health Organization 2020b). 1.4.3 Malaria treatment Malaria can quickly progress from mild to severe disease and death. Immediate and appropriate treatment is therefore a critical strategy for reducing malaria mortality. Treatment needs to be adapted to the severity of the malaria episode and the parasite species causing infection (World Health Organization 2021d). The WHO strongly advises against the overuse of antimalarial treatments to reduce the risk of emergence and spread of antimalarial resistance (World Health Organization 2011). In the fight against resistance, the key strategies are universal access to malaria diagnostic testing and the use of combination therapies (World Health Organization 2021d). Currently, the first-line recommended treatment for uncomplicated malaria are ACTs (World Health Organization 2021d). ACTs combine an artemisinin derivative with a partner drug with a different mode of 5Chapter 1. Introduction action. Artemisinins are highly effective against asexual parasite stages (White 1997) and early-stage gametocytes (Price et al. 1996). However, the half-lives of artemisinin derivatives are too short ( 1 hour for artesunate (de Vries and Dien 1996)) to effectively clear all parasites from the patient's blood (Menard et al. 2005; Schwarz et al. 2005). Therefore, and to prevent artemisinin resistance, the second drug should be long-lasting (White 1997). Currently, the recommended ACTs are (World Health Organization 2021d): \u0088Artemether + lumefantrine SP \u0088Dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine. Unlike uncomplicated malaria, severe malaria is a medical emergency and requires additional treatment. More details on the case management of severe malaria are provided in section 1.6. 1.5 At the risk of death: severe malaria If left untreated, mortality from severe malaria is very high and varies according to transmission intensity, clinical severity, parasite and host factors (Camponovo et al. 2017; Thwing, Eisele, and Steketee 2011; von Seidlein et al. 2012). Under optimal treatment, the case fatality ratio (CFR) of children with confirmed severe malaria is estimated at 8.5% (Dondorp et al. 2010). However, the CFR may be well under or above this value depending on the severe malaria case definition and the quality of severe malaria case management (Camponovo et al. 2017). Effective clinical management of severe malaria has the potential to reduce severe malaria case fatality by 76-87% (Thwing, Eisele, and Steketee 2011). 1.5.1 Epidemiology of severe malaria After a person is inoculated with Plasmodium parasites, the malaria infection may progress from asymptomatic parasitaemia, which lasts between one week and one month, to uncomplicated illness, and severe malaria with a potentially fatal outcome. Disease progression depends on the parasite species, the level of immunity of the host, and the efficacy and timing of treatment (World Health Organization 2014c). Plasmodium falciparum is the predominant cause of severe malaria but 6Chapter 1. Introduction infections with other species may also lead to severe disease (Barber et al. 2013; Groger et al. 2017; Rahimi et al. 2014). In areas with high and stable malaria transmission, severe malaria mainly occurs in children between 6 months and 5 years old. Younger children are thought to be protected by maternal antibodies (Dobbs and Dent 2016), while adults and older children that survived multiple infections with malaria have acquired specific immunity over time (Doolan, Doba no, and Baird 2009). 1.5.2 Definition and clinical classification of severe falciparum malaria The WHO defines severe falciparum malaria as the presence of asexual parasitaemia in the absence of an identified alternative cause and in the presence of clinical or laboratory features indicating severe disease (World Health Organization 2021d). The clinical manifestation of severe falciparum malaria depends on age and transmission intensity. While anaemia and convulsions are more common in children, adults more often present with jaundice and renal failure (Figure 1.1) (White et al. 2014). In high transmission areas, children with severe malaria tend to be younger and severe anaemia predominates. In low transmission areas, cerebral malaria (convulsions and coma) is more frequent and the mean age of children affected by severe malaria is higher (Reyburn et al. 2005). FIGURE 1.1: Clinical manifestations of severe malaria by age. Adapted from White et al. (2014). The WHO categorizes clinical presentations of severe falciparum malaria in children into three groups (World Health Organization 2014c): 7Chapter 1. Introduction \u0088Group 1: children with prostration, respiratory distress or shock, \u0088Group 2: children able to swallow but with haemoglobin <5g/dl or haematocrit <15%, convulsion episodes, haemoglobinuria or jaundice, and \u0088Group 3: children who require parenteral treatment because of persistent vomiting, but without other specific clinical or laboratory symptoms. Prostration is defined as the inability to sit or drink (if too young to sit) and may be combined with impaired consciousness or coma. Respiratory distress indicates metabolic acidosis and appears as nasal flaring in its mild form, and marked chest in-drawing and deep breathing in its more severe form. Severe anaemia (haemoglobin <5g/dl or haematocrit <15%) can clinically be detected by pale mucosal surfaces (e.g. gums) and palms. Haemoglobinuria, also called blackwater fever because it causes dark urine, is the presence of haemoglobin in the urine of the patient. The condition is a consequence of the rupture of malaria-infected erythrocytes and may occur early in the course of the disease as a direct consequence of the infection, or at a later stage if induced by antimalarial treatment (Dondorp et al. 2005; Dondorp et al. 2010). Like haemoglobinuria, jaundice (yellow skin, eyes, mucosal surfaces) indicates haemolysis which may lead to acute kidney injury. Among these clinical manifestations, the level of consciousness and the degree of metabolic acidosis are the strongest predictors of health outcome in children with severe malaria (Figure 1.2) (Helbok et al. 2009; Jallow et al. 2012; Marsh et 1995; Molyneux 1989; von Seidlein et al. 2012). 1.5.3 Challenges in diagnosing severe malaria In resource-limited settings, the WHO definition of severe malaria often leads to a situation in which severe malaria can only be suspected. Even though suspected malaria cases are now commonly tested with an mRDT (World Health Organization 2020b), the test may be positive due to an asymptomatic malaria infection (Minwuyelet et al. 2020; Nzobo, Ngasala, and Kihamia 2015) accompanying a non-malarial severe febrile illness, or because of prevailing antigens from a previous malaria infection (Dalrymple et al. 2018). In the absence of a confirmation of a symptomatic malaria infection, health workers diagnose based on the clinical illness presentation. However, the clinical symptoms of severe malaria considerably overlap with other infectious diseases such as meningitis, pneumonia, or septicaemia (English et al. 1996; Evans et al. 2004; Molyneux et al. 1998; World Health Organization 2021d). Meanwhile, the differential diagnosis of these other severe febrile illnesses is often not possible due to unavailability of bedside diagnostic tests for bacterial and viral infections (Hay Burgess, Wasserman, and Dahl 2006; World Health Organization 2014c) 8Chapter 1. Introduction FIGURE 1.2: Severe malaria mortality of children with cerebral and renal impairment and metabolic acidosis, alone and in combination. The sizes of the ovals are proportional to the frequency of the clinical manifestation. Adapted from White et al. (2014). and the lack of laboratory diagnostic tools in resource-limited settings (Olmsted et al. 2010). Previous studies have shown that the unspecific clinical presentation of severe malaria has implications on the perceived cause of disease by caretakers (Desmond et al. 2013) as well as treatment practice leading to the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of malaria (Leslie et al. 2012; Orish et al. 2016; Reyburn et al. 2004). 1.6 Case management of suspected severe malaria 1.6.1 Severe malaria treatment guidelines As the cause of a severe febrile illness can often not be unambiguously determined upon hospital admission, and several infections may coexist, the WHO recommends both immediate treatment with parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics and parenteral antimalarial treatment for patients with symptoms of severe malaria (World Health Organization 2021d). Currently, the first-line parenteral 9Chapter 1. Introduction treatment for severe malaria is intravenous or intramuscular artesunate. If artesunate is not available, severe malaria patients may be treated with intramuscular artemether or - as a third option - intravenous or intramuscular quinine. Artesunate has been shown to significantly reduce mortality in both adults and children compared to quinine (Sinclair et al. 2012), and in adults compared to artemether (Esu et al. 2019). The WHO recommends treating patients with severe malaria with parenteral therapy for at least 24 hours followed by a three-day course with an ACT (World Health Organization 2021d). Where complete treatment of severe malaria is not possible, which often coincides with the inability to accurately diagnose severe malaria, pre-referral treatment may be administered and the patient referred to an appropriate facility for further care and differential diagnosis. The WHO recommends intramuscular artesunate as the preferred pre-referral treatment for children and adults (World Health Organization 2021d). However, many of the remaining 400,000 malaria deaths per year happen in remote areas where injections and health care staff trained in or allowed to administered parenteral treatment are not available (Coetzer and Adeola 2020; Karra, Fink, and Canning 2017; World Health Organization 2020b). In such a situation, children less than 6 years should be treated with a single rectal dose of 10mg artesunate per kilogram body weight and referred immediately (World Health Organization 2021d). 1.6.2 Rectal artesunate In a placebo-controlled trial, rectal artesunate (RAS) reduced death and permanent disability in patients that took more than 6 hours to complete referral to the nearest health facility by 49% (Gomes et al. 2009). The drug was developed after an urgent need for a non-parenteral pre-referral treatment for severe malaria was recognized in 1996 (de Carvalho, Kreidenweiss, and Held 2021). Following a clinical trial (Krishna et al. 2001), RAS was added to the WHO Essential Medicine List in 2007, despite the unavailability of a quality-assured product approved by a regulatory authority (de Carvalho, Kreidenweiss, and Held 2021). In the following years, governments of malaria-endemic countries, donors and non-governmental organizations procured RAS; until 2014 when a multi-donor-agency taskforce restricted medicine procurement to quality-assured antimalarial products (CARAMAL Project 2018). In 2018, the WHO prequalified two RAS products, which have now become widely available in countries affected by malaria (Medicines for Malaria Venture 2021). Following the prequalification of the first RAS product, the WHO issued more detailed guidance on the use of RAS (World Health Organization 2018a). In places with limited diagnostic 10Chapter 1. Introduction capacity, RAS is indicated for children presenting with fever and a danger sign indicative of severe malaria: \u0088Convulsions, \u0088Unusually sleepy or unconscious, \u0088Not able to drink or feed anything, \u0088Vomiting everything. These dangers signs largely overlap with the clinical classifications of severe falciparum malaria in children (see section 1.5.2). To ensure appropriate post-referral treatment for severe malaria, the administration of RAS must be followed by immediate referral to a higher-level facility. If referral is impossible, treatment with RAS can be continued until oral medication is tolerated. Independent of referral completion and parenteral treatment, the administration of RAS must always be followed by a three-day course with an oral ACT. In practice, the WHO guidance on the use of RAS is applied in community settings by community health workers (CHW) and primary health centres (PHC). In many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, CHWs operate within the framework of an integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) programme (Health & Economics Finance Development Consortium 2018). ICCM is an equity-focused strategy to give access to adequate care to populations with otherwise limited access to the formal health sector (Figure 1.3) (Young et al. 2012). As part of iCCM, CHWs are trained to provide diagnosis and treatment for malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea using mRDTs, ACTs, oral antibiotics, oral rehydration salts and zinc. Cases that cannot be managed by a CHW are referred to a nearby health facility. If the child presents with suspected severe malaria (fever and a danger sign indicative of severe malaria), CHWs may administer RAS before referring (Medicines for Malaria Venture 2016). Previous research suggests that community case management can substantially reduce the mortality of children (Kidane and Morrow 2000; Munos, Walker, and Black 2010; Theodoratou et al. 2010; Walker and Black 2010) and prevent the progression of malaria from mild to severe disease (Sirima et al. 2003). 11Chapter 1. Introduction FIGURE 1.3: Role of community health workers in improving access to treatment in underserved areas. CHW = community health worker; CCM = community case management. Adapted from Young et al. (2012). 1.7 The relevance of treatment seeking for implementing rectal artesunate The effectiveness of RAS at the population level may depend on two important treatment-seeking steps along the continuum of care for severe malaria (Figure 1.4). First, as per WHO guidelines, RAS should be implemented in locations with little access to referral-level health care (World Health Organization 2018a). Treatment seeking from community-based providers (CHWs and PHCs) in remote areas is therefore key for the effective implementation of RAS. Secondly, children with suspected severe malaria require urgent referral to a health facility where appropriate treatment for severe malaria can be administered (World Health Organization 2018a). Referral completion may increase the chance that children are correctly diagnosed, receive effective antimalarial treatment, and complications of severe malaria can be appropriately managed. To understand how treatment seeking may affect the effectiveness of RAS, the multitude of factors influencing treatment-seeking behaviour needs to be considered. 1.7.1 Treatment seeking from community-based providers Community-based providers that implement RAS are CHWs and PHCs. In the three countries with the highest malaria case burden (DRC, Nigeria, Uganda), the most recent countrywide cross-sectional surveys reported low utilization of CHWs for children under five years with fever (0.7-8.4%) (INS 12Chapter 1. Introduction FIGURE 1.4: Severe malaria continuum of care for children in remote locations with little access to health care. CHW = community health worker, HC = health centre, RAS = rectal artesunate, ACT = artemisinin-based combination therapy. 2019; National Population Commission (NPC) [Nigeria] and ICF 2019; Uganda National Malaria Control Division, Uganda Bureau of Statistics, and ICF 2020). However, iCCM programmes are not always implemented across all regions of a country, which may mask high utilization in areas where iCCM programmes are deployed. Studies in areas with established CHW programmes have found low utilization ranging from 1% to 9% in Burkina Faso (Druetz et al. 2015; Sauerborn, Nougtara, and Diesfeld 1989), and higher utilization ranging from 20% to 67% in Burkina Faso, Nigeria and Uganda (Ajayi et al. 2016). Meanwhile, treatment seeking from PHCs for children with fever may be considerably higher according to the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys in DRC, Nigeria and Uganda (19-30%) (Minist` ere du Plan et Suivi de la Mise en uvre de la R\u00b4 evolution de la Modernit\u00b4 e, Minist` ere de la Sant\u00b4 e Publique, and ICF International 2014; National Population Commission (NPC) [Nigeria] and ICF 2019; Uganda National Malaria Control Division, Uganda Bureau of Statistics, and ICF 2020). PHCs may be the preferred option over CHWs for children with indications of severe disease and if the PHC is not too far away (Druetz et al. 2015; Sauerborn, Nougtara, and Diesfeld 1989). 1.7.2 Adherence to referral advice In previous studies on RAS and post-referral treatment seeking, referral completion of RAS users to the nearest health facility was mostly high, ranging from 81% to 90% (Mvumbi et al. 2019; 13Chapter 1. Introduction et al. 2009; Siribi\u00b4 e et al. 2016; Warsame et al. 2016). Only one study found low referral completion ( <10%) among children who had previously received RAS (Lal et al. 2018). The effect of RAS administration on referral completion is currently not well understood. An observational study reported lower referral completion among RAS users compared to non-users; however, the pre- defined margin of a 15% difference was not reached and the analysis did not control for other factors influencing referral completion (Mvumbi et al. 2019). A qualitative study found that caregivers were balancing the conflicting interests of adhering to the referral recommendation and other priorities when the child's condition had improved after RAS administration (Simba et al. 2010). In a study in Uganda, the odds of completing referral were 73% lower if children had received pre-referral treatment including RAS (Nanyonjo et al. 2015). Studies on referral completion in comparable settings but outside of the context of RAS implementation are comparatively rare. Available evidence includes one qualitative study from India (de Zoysa et al. 1998), and two quantitative studies from Ecuador and Sierra Leone (Kalter et al. 2003; Thomson et al. 2011). The quantitative studies reported referral completion of severely ill children of 58% in Ecuador and 88% in Sierra Leone. 1.7.3 Factors influencing treatment seeking Factors influencing treatment seeking range from socio-economic factors, to determinants of access to health care, disease severity and symptoms, health beliefs and health literacy. In previous studies, maternal education and household income were positively associated with seeking treatment from a formal health care provider (Anselmi, Lagarde, and Hanson 2015; Burton et al. al. 2015; Najnin, Bennett, and Luby 2011; Odu et al. 2015). Meanwhile, there is consistent evidence that difficulties in geographical access to health providers in terms of distance and transport have a detrimental effect on treatment seeking (Anselmi, Lagarde, and Hanson 2015; Odu et al. 2015; Thandar et al. 2015). However, other dimensions of access (Obrist et al. 2007) also play a role. A study in Mozambique showed that the availability of staff and equipment at the closest health facility increased the probability of seeking treatment (Anselmi, Lagarde, and Hanson 2015). The affordability of treatment and other costs associated with seeking treatment, such as the transport costs, may negatively affect treatment seeking (Getahun, Deribe, and Deribew 2010; Thandar et al. 2015). Another access dimension that may influence care seeking is the acceptability of the health service provision in terms of the caregiver's or patient's trust in the personal and professional competence of the provider (Anaba et al. 2020; Russell 2005). Independent of barriers to accessing health care, illness severity may affect the decisions made throughout the treatment-seeking process. In previous studies, children with more severe symptoms, or children that were perceived more severely ill by the caregiver, were more likely to be 14Chapter 1. Introduction brought to a health care provider compared to children with (perceived) mild illness (Burton et al. 2011; Elimian et al. 2020; Najnin, Bennett, and Luby 2011; Tsukahara et al. 2015). In some studies, health beliefs related to a supernatural cause of the illness were associated with treatment seeking from traditional healers (Ahorlu et al. 1997; Dillip et al. 2009; Hausmann Muela 2000; Warsame et al. 2007). On the other hand, a higher level of health literacy, measured for example in knowledge about malaria, can positively influence the decision to seek health care from a formal provider (Do et al. 2018; Thandar et al. 2015). 1.8 Answering open questions: the CARAMAL project Following the clinical trial that showed a significant effect of RAS on the mortality of children with suspected severe malaria (Gomes et al. 2009), the question was raised as to whether these results were applicable to real-life settings (von Seidlein and Deen 2009). This question emerged again when new efforts were undertaken to manufacture a quality-assured RAS product, which triggered the designing of the Community Access to Rectal Artesunate for Malaria (CARAMAL) project. The CARAMAL project comprised the large-scale implementation of RAS into existing iCCM programmes and at primary healthcare level, and an operational research component accompanying the implementation of RAS. The goal of the research component was to investigate the feasibility of reducing case fatality in children with suspected severe malaria by delivering RAS through established iCCM platforms and PHCs without unintended consequences on referral completion or post-referral treatment. The CARAMAL project provides a comprehensive analysis of the severe malaria continuum of care including referral processes and completion rates after attending a community-based provider (see Chapter 5 and 6), the quality of post-referral treatment (Signorell et al. manuscript in preparation), and the impact of RAS on health outcomes (see Chapter 7). More details about the CARAMAL project are provided in Chapter 3 and in Appendix 1. 15Chapter 2 Aim and objectives The aim of this PhD project is to investigate treatment-seeking and case management practices for suspected severe malaria in children under five years in three diverse settings in sub-Saharan Africa, and to evaluate the implications of these practices for the implementation of RAS. In order to address this research aim, the following specific objectives were identified: Objective 1: To review definitions of severe febrile illness/suspected severe malaria and treatment-seeking outcomes in peer-reviewed studies on children under 5 years in low and middle income countries. Objective 2: To assess changes in referral completion after the implementation of RAS and investigate associations between referral completion and RAS administration. 2.1 To describe referral completion in children with suspected severe malaria after attending a community-based provider. 2.2 To evaluate the impact of RAS implementation and administration on referral completion. 2.3 To identify other factors associated with differences in referral completion. Objective 3: To understand post-referral treatment-seeking pathways and case management of children with suspected severe malaria attending a community-based provider. 3.1 To investigate antimalarial drug administration and the appropriateness of treatment along treatment-seeking pathways. 3.2 To assess referral recommendations of health care providers along treatment-seeking pathways. 3.3 To assess adherence to referral recommendations along treatment-seeking pathways. 16Chapter 2. Aim and objectives 3.4 To understand reasons for going to different types of health care providers along treatment-seeking pathways. Objective 4: To investigate the effect of treatment seeking and case management on the health outcome of children with suspected severe malaria. 4.1 To assess the effect of RAS administration on the health outcome of children with suspected severe malaria. 4.2 To assess the effect of referral completion on the health outcome of children with suspected severe malaria. 4.3 To assess the effect of appropriate post-referral treatment on the health outcome of children with suspected severe malaria. 4.4 To identify other factors associated with differences in health outcomes of children with suspected severe malaria. Each of the research objectives corresponds to a chapter in this thesis. The sequence of the chapters aligns with the sequence of the objectives, starting with Chapter 4 addressing Objective 1. 17Chapter 3 Methods The original research articles included in this PhD thesis (Chapter 5-7) are analyses of data obtained through the CARAMAL patient surveillance system (PSS), complemented by a scoping review of published literature (Chapter 4). This chapter focuses on giving a brief overview of the PSS. More details on the CARAMAL project, including the overall methodology, are provided in Appendix 1. 3.1 CARAMAL patient surveillance system The PSS was implemented in three health zones in DRC, three Local Government Areas (LGA) in Nigeria, and three districts in Uganda (Table 3.1). The study area comprised a population of approximately 2.5 million including 476,000 children under 5 years. Data collection started approximately 10 months before the implementation of RAS and continued for 15 months thereafter. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), together with national and local health authorities, were responsible for introducing and distributing quality-assured RAS. The before-after design allowed for comparisons between study participants enrolled in the pre- and post-implementation periods, and between RAS users and RAS non-users. Children under 5 years were eligible for enrolment if they presented with fever and at least one iCCM danger sign to a CHW, or were diagnosed with severe malaria by a health worker at a PHC or at a referral health facility (RHF). The coverage with community-based providers (CHWs and PHCs) and RHFs varied significantly by country (Table 3.1). Uganda had the highest coverage with community-based providers, and DRC the highest coverage with RHFs. The PSS was implemented by local research partners: Makerere University School of Public Health in Uganda, Akena Associates in Nigeria, and Kinshasa School of Public Health in DRC. The local study teams trained community-based providers in identifying eligible children and set up locally adapted notification systems to receive information on children enrolled by these providers. CHWs were instructed to conduct an mRDT for study purposes, as testing was not foreseen for children with danger signs according to iCCM guidelines. The local research partners placed study staff at RHFs to 18Chapter 3. Methods TABLE 3.1: Study areas, estimated under-five (U5) population, number of under-fives per community-based provider (community health workers and primary health centres) and referral health facilities in the study areas, by country (all data for 2018). DR Congo Nigeria Uganda Study areas Ipamu, Kenge, Kingandu health facility7,045 55,022 11,816 enrol children with severe malaria that had not previously been seen by a community-based provider, and follow up on children already enrolled by a community-based provider who completed referral. After 28 days, all children were visited at home to assess their health status, interview caregivers about treatment-seeking pathways as well as treatments received with a focus on antimalarial drugs. To complement the health status as reported by the caregiver, study staff performed an mRDT (SD Bioline or CareStart) and a haemoglobin measurement (HemoCue). If children were deceased by day 28, the follow up interview was postponed to approximately one month after their passing to respect the mourning period. In total, there were three theoretical contact points with the PSS for each child. Figure 3.1 shows possible combinations of contacts with the PSS and provides information on the data collected at each point. Besides information specifically collected for CARAMAL, routine indicators collected by providers were also recorded. 3.2 Analyses of treatment seeking and malaria case management Chapter 5 presents an analysis of referral completion comparing the following study groups: 1) children enrolled before RAS was implemented, 2) children enrolled after RAS was implemented without receiving RAS, and 3) children enrolled after RAS was implemented who received RAS. Referral completion was defined as a child being brought to a designated RHF at any stage of the 19Chapter 3. Methods FIGURE 3.1: Schematic representation of possible points of contact in the patient surveillance system (PSS). Green triangles represent points of contact, red triangles absence of contact.

A child was considered to have received RAS if the community-based provider who enrolled the child reported administering RAS, or if CARAMAL staff at the RHF or the caregiver reported that the child had been administered RAS. The secondary outcome of the analysis in Chapter 5 is timely referral completion defined as completing referral on the same or next day after enrolment. The number of days between enrolment and reaching a RHF was either calculated as the difference between the enrolment date and the date of admission at a RHF, or obtained from the caregiver during follow-up. Chapter 6 is an in-depth analysis of post-referral treatment seeking and malaria case management of children enrolled after the implementation of RAS in Uganda. Information on treatment seeking, the administration of antimalarial drugs, referral recommendations and reasons for seeking care from different types of post-referral providers were all obtained from caregivers during the follow-up interviews. To assess data quality, caregiver-reported data were compared to information obtained from CHW and RHF patient records. 20Chapter 3. Methods Chapter 7 provides an analysis of the association of referral completion and malaria case management with children being dead or sick at follow-up. Malaria RDT-positivity and haemoglobin concentration were complementary indicators of morbidity on day 28. RAS administration, referral completion and timeliness of referral completion were defined as described above in the paragraph on Chapter 5. In DRC and Nigeria, data recorded by CARAMAL staff at the RHFs provided information on post- referral administration of parenteral antimalarials and ACTs. In Uganda, antimalarial treatments reported by caregivers during follow-up were also considered. 21Chapter 4 Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness in children in low and middle income countries: A scoping review Nina C.

Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness 4.1 Abstract Objectives: Understanding treatment seeking for severe febrile illness (SFI) is methodologically challenging. In this scoping review, we investigate definitions of severe febrile illness in treatment- seeking studies on children under 5 years of age in low and middle income countries. We analyze the association of SFI definitions with different concepts of treatment seeking and identify related research gaps. Methods: We searched Pubmed, Scopus and WHOLIS, and screened references of included publications for eligibility. Results: Definitions of SFI had either a biomedical perspective (predominantly in quantitative studies) or a caregiver perspective (predominantly in qualitative studies). In quantitative analyses of treatment seeking, severity was more often conceptualized as a determinant rather than an outcome of a treatment-seeking process. The majority of quantitative analyses only included surviving children or did not explicitly mention dead children. Conclusion: Different research questions lead to diverse definitions and concepts of severity and treatment seeking outcomes, which limits the comparability of the available evidence. Systematic exclusion of dead children is likely to bias inferences on the association of treatment seeking and health outcomes of children with SFI in low and middle income countries.

Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness 4.2 Introduction In 2019, low and middle income countries (LMICs) accounted for 99% of the 5.2 million deaths in children under 5 years of age worldwide (United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation 2020). Despite important reductions, infectious causes such as pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria continue to significantly contribute to child mortality (Liu et al. 2016). Early and appropriate treatment can considerably reduce deaths from infectious causes, preventing the progression from mild to severe disease and death (United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation 2019). Prompt and appropriate treatment seeking therefore plays an important role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 3.2 target of reducing under 5 mortality to 25 per 1000 live births (United Nations n.d.). Reciprocally, severity of illness influences health seeking behaviour (Rosenstock 1974). The existing scientific literature includes several reviews of treatment seeking for childhood illnesses which take into consideration severity of illness as a determinant of the care seeking process (Colvin et al. 2013; Geldsetzer et al. 2014; Kassam et al. 2015; Price et al. 2019; Williams and Jones 2004). Most of these reviews have focused on common childhood illnesses such as malaria, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. However, due to the clinical overlap of malaria with pneumonia and other infectious diseases (Berkley et al. 1999; Crump et al. 2011; 1996; Gwer, Newton, and Berkley 2007; Reyburn et al. 2004) and the high case fatality ratio among admitted patients with febrile illness, etiology research has suggested a syndromic approach for research on severe febrile illness (SFI) (Prasad et al. 2015). This approach is particularly relevant to treatment-seeking research because caregivers recognize and classify their child's illness based on observed signs and symptoms. Synthesizing the evidence on treatment seeking for SFI in children from a syndromic perspective can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms connecting illness presentation, care seeking, and health outcomes. Analyzing the underlying methodological approaches of such studies will help to understand the validity and comparability of the available evidence. The concept of SFI has been referred to by several studies. Even though Roddy et al. (2019) describe SFI as \"a commonly documented and globally recognized cause of morbidity and mortality\", definitions of SFI in the scientific literature vary. While some authors have focused on clinical diagnosis (Reyburn et al. 2004; Roddy et al. 2019) or causal agents (Prasad et al. 2015), others defined SFI as fever with danger signs according to the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines (Ellis et al. 2012). Health behaviour theories have also pointed out the importance of perceived severity for health-related behaviour such as treatment seeking (Janz and Becker 1984; Milne, Sheeran, and Orbell 2000; Weinman et al. 1996). 24Chapter 4. Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness Considering the importance of severity for treatment seeking and health outcomes in children under 5 and the ambiguity of SFI definitions in the existing scientific literature, this scoping review aims at investigating the definitions of SFI and concepts of severity in studies on treatment seeking for febrile illness in children under 5. Additionally, we assessed potential sources of bias in the study designs of treatment-seeking studies for SFI to identify research gaps. 4.3 Methods For this scoping review, we followed the approach suggested by Arksey and O'Malley (2005) with the following key stages: 4.3.1 Stage 1: Identifying research question The purpose of this review is to explore definitions of SFI, concepts of severity, and research methods used in studies on treatment seeking for SFI in children under 5 in LMICs. SFI was defined and categorized iteratively throughout the screening and coding process. Treatment seeking was defined as seeking help outside of home from any provider even if the treatment prescribed by the provider was used for home management. LMICs were defined according to the World Bank classification of countries by income (World Bank 2018). 4.3.2 Stage 2: Identifying relevant studies We searched PubMed, Scopus and WHOLIS (last update on 29th April 2020) without restrictions of the publication date. Studies published in English or French were included. Malaria and pneumonia were used synonymously with fever based on previous research showing a high sensitivity of fever for malaria and pneumonia diagnosis (Mutanda et al. 2014; Perkins et al. 1997; Rambaud-Althaus et al. 2015; Weber et al. 1997). We adapted the search filter for pediatric studies proposed by Leclercq et al. (2013) and used the search filter for LMICs suggested by the Cochrane Collaboration (2012). No search filter was used for severe illness to allow for an iterative exploration of SFI definitions. The search terms and filters used are compiled in Table A.1 (Appendix 2). 4.3.3 Stage 3: Study selection All citations were imported into Zotero 5 (Corporation for Digital Scholarship, Vienna, VA, USA) and duplicates removed manually. Studies were included if all inclusion and exclusion criteria were met (Table 4.1). One researcher screened titles, abstracts and full text of the citations. Studies for 25Chapter 4. Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness which no abstract was available were put forward to full text screening. Articles were excluded from further analysis if they could not be obtained as full text through online databases and library searches at the University of Basel. Reference lists of included studies were screened to identify additional references. TABLE 4.1: Inclusion and exclusion criteria of studies.

Categories of study characteristics were defined a priori and provided the coding framework for data extraction. For some categories, codes were defined a priori (Table 4.2). Codes emerging from the included manuscripts are shown in Table 4.3 (year of publication, study location, disease, inclusion criteria, treatment-seeking outcome, concept of severity) and Table 4.4 (definitions of SFI). Definitions of SFI were extracted from all included articles. For quantitative analyses, we iteratively explored concepts of severity, extracted treatment-seeking outcomes, as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria to assess bias. Treatment seeking outcomes were categorized into: 1) treatment- seeking proportion 2) referral adherence, 3) sources of treatment, and 4) delays in treatment seeking. Only treatment-seeking outcomes in relation to SFI were coded. 4.3.5 Stage 5: Collating, summarizing, and reporting the results From MaxQDA 2018 Plus, we exported all codes to Microsoft Excel format. After importing into Stata 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA), we used descriptive statistics to summarize our results. 26Chapter 4.

Health care provider Participants are enrolled at a health care provider upon attendance or were identified as eligible participants through the screening of patient register entries. Community + health care providerParticipants are enrolled from their location of home and at health care providers. Sample sizeAll Total number of illness episodes included in the quantitative treatment-seeking research component SFI Number of SFI episodes included in the quantitative treatment seeking research component Definition of SFI - Descriptions of SFI. SFI is any febrile condition that is described as severe, serious, complicated, dangerous, fatal, deadly, or life threatening. The definition of severity may be pre-defined or emerge from the findings of the study. Concepts of severity- Severity may play different roles in quantitative analyses of treatment seeking (e.g. covariate, inclusion criteria, etc.). The exploration of this concept is iterative and inductive. Inclusion criteria- Inclusion criteria for the enrolment of participants Exclusion criteria- Exclusion criteria for the enrolment of participants Treatment-seeking outcomesTreatment-seeking proportionThe study outcome classifies treatment-seeking actions for SFI into seeking care from outside home and not seeking care from outside of home. For studies enrolling participants from health care providers, the treatment-seeking proportion distinguishes between children seeking care from another provider and children directly coming from home before attending the enrolling provider. Referral adherence Dichotomous variable that distinguishes between adhering and not adhering to referral advice for SFI. Other dichotomous outcomeOther dichotomous treatment-seeking outcomes for SFI, e.g. seeking care from appropriate provider vs. seeking care from inappropriate provider. Sources of treatment Treatment-seeking outcomes are classified into different sources of treatment for SFI. Delays Delays can either be defined as a threshold after which treatment seeking is considered to be delayed, or the treatment-seeking outcome is reported as the mean or median time until treatment.

The child is diagnosed with severe disease by a clinician (no signs and symptoms specified).Tsukahara et al. 2015 Children with \"life-threatening events that required emergency care such as resuscitation, rehydration, blood transfusion, respiratory supports etc.\" Guidelines Based on a clinical guideline, the febrile condition is classified as severe.Escribano-Ferrer et al. 2017 \"An illness was labelled as 'severe febrile illness' if it met the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) classifications of severe malaria.\" Disease outcome Based on the disease outcome, the febrile condition is classified as severe.Kassile et al. 2014 \"(. . . ) the child's condition progressing from mild to severe, resulting in negative outcomes such as irreversible disability or death.\" Clinical signs and symptomsSpecific clinical signs and symptoms are considered an indicator of severe disease.Palmiere 1972 \"(. . . ) children were admitted to the Regional Hospital with a diagnosis of severe malaria (altered consciousness, coma, convulsions, hypoglycaemia, difficulty in breathing, severe anaemia, prostration).\" Caregiver definitionsLocal illness concepts Local and/or traditional understandings of health conditions perceived to be severe.Beiersmann et al. 2007 \"The local concept of kono is very close to the biomedical definition of cerebral malaria.

Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness 4.4 Results 4.4.1 Summary of included studies We retrieved 1626 citations from the three databases. After removing duplicates, the screening process, application of inclusion criteria, and a reference search, we identified 82 studies to be included in the analysis (Figure 4.1). Main reasons for exclusion in the screening process were (1) the study did not discuss treatment seeking, (2) the study population were mothers instead of children, (3) the study did not distinguish the age group of children under 5 years from other age groups, or (4) the study did not discuss severity. Included manuscripts are listed in Table 4.3. The reference list for Table 4.3 is provided in Appendix 2. FIGURE 4.1: Summary of the literature search and selection process. 32Chapter 4. Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness With the exception of three publication, all selected articles were published from the year 2000 onwards (Table 4.5). The large majority of studies was conducted in the African Region (82%) (Figure 4.2). Half were conducted in rural areas (49%). We found that most studies (65%) belonged to the field of malaria research. Other publications mentioned pneumonia or acute respiratory infection (ARI) (32%), in four instances together with malaria. Only one study on meningitis met the inclusion criteria. The remaining six studies (7%) did not refer to any specific disease as the cause for fever in children. The majority of included studies analyzed treatment seeking for SFI using quantitative methods (46%). We identified 27 publications (33%) which discussed treatment seeking for SFI in a purely qualitative way while 17 studies (21%) used a mixed methods approach. Five mixed method studies that explored concepts of SFI in the qualitative component were classified as qualitative SFI study because SFI or treatment seeking did not play a role in the quantitative component of the study. Most studies enrolled their participants from the community (67%). Only six studies (7%) enrolled participants from both community and health care providers. This combination of recruitment strategies was unique to mixed methods and qualitative studies. The median total sample size of quantitative treatment seeking analyses was 304 illness episodes (range: 25-6,856). The respective median sample size of SFI episodes was 112 (range: 12-5,485).

Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness 4.4.2 Definitions of severe febrile illness We classified definitions of SFI in treatment-seeking studies into two main categories (Table 4.4). The first category defines SFI from a biomedical perspective and comprises four subcategories: clinical management or diagnosis (n=3), guidelines (n=21), disease outcome (n=9), and clinical signs and symptoms classified as severe by the authors of the included study (n=16). Most studies of the category \"Guidelines\" referred to the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) or integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) guidelines (16/21 = 76%). Studies which classified specific signs and symptoms as severe were often applying criteria similar to or overlapping with the IMCI/iCCM danger signs. Except for the study by Kassam et al. (2016) which defined negative disease outcome as death or disability, all other studies of this category restricted the definition to death only. In the second category, we grouped SFI definitions with a focus on the caregiver's perspective into four subcategories: local illness concepts (n=23), perceived severity (n=13), treatment failure (n=2), and recognized signs and symptoms classified as severe by the caregiver (n=11). Mitiku and Assefa (2017) used a Health Belief Model construct to define perceived severity. Anaba et al. (2020) defined perceived severity as caregivers thinking that pneumonia can lead to hospitalization or children may die. The remaining studies did not elaborate on the meaning of perceived severity. In the study by Oluchi et al. (2019), it was not clear which criteria defined severity. Most studies used only one concept to describe SFI (82%). Using several definitions of SFI occurred in fourteen studies (17%) of which one quantitative, three mixed methods, and four qualitative studies combined a biomedical definition and a definition with a caregiver focus. Overall, 37 included studies (45%) defined SFI from a uniquely biomedical perspective and 36 (44%) uniquely from the perspective of caregivers. The biomedical definitions were more common in quantitative studies (27/38 = 71%) than in qualitative (3/27 = 11%) or mixed methods studies (7/17 = 41%). In quantitative studies that used a caregiver definition (9/38 = 24%), SFI was mostly a febrile illness of high perceived severity (8/9 = 89%). Biomedical definitions were also the predominant definitions in studies enrolling participants from health care providers (12/21 = 57%). In the process of coding, we found that SFI with convulsions were often treated as a condition distinct from conditions with other symptoms. In ten out of fifteen studies that explicitly distinguished convulsions from other conditions, convulsions were the prominent feature of a local illness concept. 35Chapter 4. Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness 4.4.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria in quantitative analyses (N = 55) Out of 55 studies that quantitatively analyzed treatment seeking for SFI in children, 53 studies (96%) restricted the inclusion of children based on age. The most common age group were children aged 0-59 months (69%). The remaining two studies were a cohort of live-born babies and a facility-based study with more than 80% children under 5. Fever or a history of fever was an inclusion criterion in 26 studies (47%). In accordance with the inclusion criteria of this review, thirteen studies (24%) included children based on a diagnosis of malaria or pneumonia. Other studies used a vignette which described a febrile condition, enrolled children with any kind of illness but described treatment seeking for fever separately, described a local illness concept that was commonly associated with fever, or fever was not an inclusion criteria but more than 80% of included children were febrile. For community-based studies, it was common to include children that were sick within a specified time period prior to data collection (25/39 = 64%). In most cases, this recall period was two weeks (16/25 = 64%). Of those studies with a recall period, two studies from the same first author explicitly excluded children with ongoing illness (Dillip et al. 2009; Dillip et al. 2012). The study by Ellis et al. (2012) was the only community-based study explicitly including children that were sick at the time of data collection. Quantitative analyses based on health care provider enrolments (N = 14) included children that either attended the health care provider (57%), were admitted (29%), or were referred by the health care provider (14%). In sixteen studies (29%), severity was an inclusion criteria for the analysis of treatment seeking. Most quantitative analyses included study participants irrespective of disease severity but analyzed severe illness separately, or compared treatment seeking for severe illness to treatment seeking for mild illness. Five studies exclusively included dead children (9%). Both dead and alive children were included in ten studies (18%). Inclusion irrespective of health outcome was more common if studies enrolled participants from health care providers (5/14 = 36%) than from communities (4/39 = 10%). The majority of the studies (62%) only included alive children or did not explicitly mention dead children. In nine cases (16%), a vignette was the basis for treatment-seeking questions. Three studies also enrolled children with an ongoing illness but used a vignette to increase the sample size, or compare hypothetical with actual treatment seeking. 4.4.4 Treatment-seeking outcomes assessed in quantitative analyses (N = 55) Twenty-three studies (42%) distinguished between treatment from outside home and not seeking care from outside home for SFI. Of these, eighteen studies (78%, N = 23) further differentiated 36Chapter 4. Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness between different sources of treatment. We found four studies (5%) that reported on referral adherence of which three studies specified to which kind of provider children went after being referred. Other dichotomous outcomes in nineteen studies (34%) were for example \"seeking care from a trained/appropriate provider vs all other actions\" or \"seeking care from a community health worker vs all other actions\". Of those, only one study provided further details on the treatment sources. Overall, 27 studies (49%) specified the treatment sources which consisted of either first providers (n=9), any provider throughout the whole treatment-seeking process (n=7), a known sequence of providers (n=7), or providers for which their involvement in the treatment-seeking process was not clear (n=4). Mixed methods studies considerably more often specified the treatment sources than quantitative studies (82% (N = 17) vs 34% (N = 38)). Delays were a treatment-seeking outcome in 22 studies (40%). Delays were usually defined as a threshold time period (normally 24h) to reach a health care provider after the onset of symptoms. Four studies used a more complex approach to defining delays by additionally including delays to treatment. In six studies, delay was a continuous variable. 4.4.5 Concepts of severity in quantitative analyses (N = 55) Quantitative analyses may use several concepts of severity. For example, a study may use two different definitions of SFI and subsequently apply two different concepts of severity, or compare severe illness against mild illness in a first step to subsequently describe treatment seeking for severe illness in more detail without comparison to non-severe disease. The concept of severity in quantitative analyses did not always become evident from the analysis itself. In some cases, the introduction or discussion of the manuscript had to be consulted to understand whether treatment seeking was considered a consequence of illness severity or vice versa. In two studies, the (sub-)analyses included severely ill children only and severity did not play any further role in explaining treatment seeking or being explained by treatment seeking (Ajayi et al. 2016; Siribi\u00b4 e et al. 2016). In one study, severity both explained treatment seeking and was explained by treatment seeking (M\u00a8 uller et al. 2003). Severity explaining treatment seeking (N = 41) The majority of the studies (41/55 = 75%) conducted analyses that sought to explain treatment seeking as a consequence of illness severity. Seventeen analyses (44%) compared treatment seeking for SFI against treatment seeking for non-severe illness without additional covariates (often by means 37Chapter 4. Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness of a two-way table). In fifteen analyses (37%), severity was a covariate among other determinants of treatment-seeking behaviour. Twelve analyses (29%) did not compare against mild conditions but nevertheless understood treatment-seeking actions as a consequence of the severe condition of the child. Biomedical SFI definitions (n=26) were more common than definitions with a caregiver focus (n=18). Biomedical definitions were either derived from guidelines (n=13), based on symptoms (n=12), or clinical diagnosis (n=1) (Figure 4.3). Among analyses with a caregiver definition, perceived severity (n=8) and local illness concepts (n=8) were the most frequent SFI definitions before symptoms (n=2). In seven studies, the local illness concept was explored in a qualitative component of a mixed method study. Treatment seeking explaining severity (N = 13) Thirteen studies (24%, N = 55) conducted analyses that sought to explain severe illness as a consequence of treatment seeking, e.g. if treatment seeking was delayed or an inappropriate provider was consulted. Seven analyses (54%) compared mild against severe disease to understand the influence of treatment seeking on the development of severe illness. In six analyses (46%) only severe cases were included but the study narrative was clear about the causal direction of the relationship between treatment seeking and severe illness. Only biomedical definitions of SFI were used of which disease outcome, i.e. death, was the most common one (n = 8) (Figure 4.3). 38Chapter 4. Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness FIGURE 4.3: Severe febrile illness (SFI) definitions in quantitative treatment-seeking analyses, by concept of severity and analysis approach. 39Chapter 4. Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness 4.5 Discussion In this scoping review, we explored the definitions of SFI in treatment-seeking studies and investigated concepts of severity in quantitative analyses of treatment-seeking behaviour. The definitions of SFI differed between quantitative and qualitative studies, and depended on the direction of the causal pathway between illness severity and treatment seeking in quantitative analyses. Our findings suggest that concerning treatment-seeking outcomes and the definition of SFI two perspectives exist. The first perspective is normative, i.e. what people should do, and emerges from the idea of a health system that allocates resources for rational and efficient use (Garro 1998; MacKian, Bedri, and Lovel 2004; Palmiere 1972). Accordingly, we found that treatment seeking is often dichotomized into right and wrong actions, e.g. seeking care from an appropriate or trained provider versus all other actions. Consequently, children who sought treatment from an inappropriate or untrained provider belong to the same category as children who did not seek care at all. This normative simplification of the treatment-seeking process was also present in studies which only report the first provider after illness onset or referral, studies which measure delay to provider attendance (instead of treatment), studies which dichotomize delay into early and late, and one study on referral adherence which did not specify the source of subsequent treatment. Besides normative assumptions, the relative rare occurrence of severe illness, reflected by the smaller size of SFI (sub-)samples, could be a reason why many studies aggregate treatment-seeking outcomes to detect statistical significant differences. However, depending on the research question, this normative approach increases the risk of oversimplifying human behaviour. Similarly, we found biomedical definitions of SFI to be of normative nature. The IMCI/iCCM algorithm offers clear instructions on treatment and referral to higher level facilities for cases of SFI (World Health Organization 2014a). While death is not necessarily normative, its occurrence in children is a clear indication that medical care should have been sought and provided. A systematic review by Price et al. (2019) used the Pathways to Survival framework to explore modifiable factors of the care seeking process contributing to death. The Pathways to Survival framework uses similar steps in the treatment-seeking process that above have been described as normative (Waldman, Campbell, and Steketee 1996). Both examples show that connecting illness definitions with a normative understanding of treatment-seeking induces a normative understanding of the illness itself. 40Chapter 4. Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness In quantitative studies, biomedical definitions are predominant. This approach may be the preferred choice when treatment seeking explains severe illness. With increasing severity of the health outcome, understanding the circumstances that lead to severe disease becomes more important and relevant (Price et al. 2019). Congruently, most of the analyses in studies which sought to explain the development of SFI with treatment seeking defined SFI as death. However, when a severe presentation of illness is used to explain treatment seeking a caregiver definition might be more appropriate. Local understanding of disease does not always overlap with biomedical definitions, despite previous research showing that caregivers are able to recognize symptoms indicating severe disease (Colvin et al. 2013; Hill et al. 2003). The tendency to ignore the caregiver perspective in analyses conceptualizing treatment seeking as a reaction to SFI may be a consequence of the lack of involvement of social scientists in treatment-seeking studies (Williams and Jones 2004). Treatment-seeking studies are conducted with different intentions: informing the implementation of an intervention (Akogun et al. Baume, Helitzer, and Kachur 2000; Kassam al. 2016a), effectiveness of an intervention (Druetz et al. 2015; Escribano-Ferrer et al. 2017), and investigating barriers to health care (Ellis et al. 2012; Foster and Vilendrer 2009; Mitiku and Assefa 2017) among others. These intentions should be reflected in the definitions, concepts and methodological approaches of a study. The second perspective is descriptive, i.e. what people in fact do, and takes into consideration caregivers' need to seek treatment for their children in a context of limited resources (Garro 1998; Williams and Jones 2004). This descriptive approach portrays treatment seeking as a process involving multiple providers with changing sequence and several stages of delay. Given its descriptive and inductive nature, complete treatment-seeking narratives are more common in qualitative research (Al-Busaidi 2008; Williams and Jones 2004). However, we found several examples of quantitative analyses from mostly mixed methods studies that were able to capture the complexities of complete treatment-seeking pathways (Baume, Helitzer, and Kachur Ellis et al. 2012; Snavely et al. 2018). Correspondingly, the non-normative approach to define SFI are caregiver definitions. While these definitions were most common in qualitative studies, a considerable number of quantitative analyses conceptualizing treatment seeking as a consequence of SFI used a caregiver definition. One of the predominant caregiver definitions was perceived severity. Except for two studies, none of the included studies elaborated on the meaning of perceived severity. Several health behaviour theories emphasize the multidimensionality of perceived severity which may take into consideration emotions, health consequences including death, disease knowledge, and effects on social and work 41Chapter 4. Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness life including economic consequences (Milne, Sheeran, and Orbell 2000; Rosenstock 1974; Weinman et al. 1996). The failure of quantitative studies to explore the meaning of perceived severity may explain why some studies find an association between perceived severity and treatment seeking (Kassam et al. 2016a; Taffa and Chepngeno 2005; Tsukahara et al. 2015) while others do not (Do et al. 2018; Kassile et al. 2014; Tinuade, Iyabo, and Durotoye 2010). Additionally, recall periods are a common feature of quantitative treatment studies. Depending on the disease outcome and experiences with health care providers, caregivers may reevaluate the illness of their child throughout the treatment-seeking process and thereafter (Hunt, Jordan, and Irwin 1989; Kassam et al. 2016b; Takayama, Yamazakia, and Katsumata 2001). Therefore, the perceived severity reported several weeks after the illness episode may not reflect the caregiver's perception during the period of treatment seeking. To maximize the value of a caregiver definition of SFI, the underlying assumptions need to be well understood and if necessary explored within the context of the same study. Mixed method studies were outstanding in several ways. Combining qualitative and quantitative methods allows to explore the local meaning of SFI and to understand the importance of different health providers as treatment sources for this illness category. Some studies failed to make use of this major advantage of a mixed methods approach, using different SFI definitions in the qualitative and quantitative components, or exploring a local illness concept in the qualitative component and ignoring it in the quantitative part. Additionally, we found that mixed method studies more often specify the treatment sources than quantitative studies. Even though this approach does not depend on the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, it might be an indication of the involvement of social scientists who employ a less normative understanding of the complexities of human behaviour (Williams and Jones 2004). We found several indications of a lack of methodological rigor which has been a concern in previous reviews of treatment seeking for malaria (McCombie 1996; Williams and Jones 2004). First, the stage of the treatment-seeking pathway at which a specific health care provider was consulted was not always clear. To understand the complex and iterative process of treatment seeking, studies need to be transparent about the stages of the treatment-seeking process being part of the research and which types of provider were consulted. Secondly, retrospective community-based studies often fail to explicitly state the inclusion or exclusion of dead children or children with ongoing illness. Besides ethical concerns, the inclusion of children with ongoing illness whose treatment-seeking pathway may not have been finished, and the exclusion of dead children whose treatment-seeking pathways may be different from surviving children increases the risk of selection bias. By 42Chapter 4. Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness systematically excluding dead children in cross-sectional surveys, problematic treatment-seeking pathways at community level remain hidden and generated evidence may portray an unrealistically positive picture of local treatment-seeking practices. In general, treatment-seeking studies including dead and alive children are scarce resulting in a lack of evidence to understand the differences in treatment-seeking pathways between surviving children and children that die, and hence, in a more general sense, the association of treatment seeking and health outcomes (Price et al. 2019). An additional concern is the relative abundance of treatment-seeking studies on mild illness compared to severe illness (Geldsetzer et al. 2014; Williams and Jones 2004). Demographic and Health Surveys, Malaria Indicator Surveys, and Multiple Cluster Indicator Surveys collect quantitative data on treatment seeking for fever in children in a majority of malaria-endemic countries but do not consider severity as an explanatory variable (Battle et al. 2016). Adding a severity indicator to large-scale surveys would increase the availability of data on SFI and related treatment-seeking behaviour. A challenge remains the definition of a meaningful severity indicator applicable to a wide range of contexts to allow for cross-country comparisons. 4.5.1 Limitations The methodology of this review has several limitations. Due to the diversity in definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies, we conducted a scoping review instead of a systematic review. Unlike a systematic review, scoping reviews do not allow for the synthetization of evidence and aggregation of findings from the body of literature (Arksey and O'Malley 2005). Instead, we summarize the range of research and identify research gaps. Concerning treatment-seeking outcomes, the scope of our findings is limited by the exclusion of studies on treatment seeking for non-severe febrile illness. The frequency and range of treatment-seeking outcomes might be different in studies on mild illness. Malaria and pneumonia are two of the most common febrile illnesses in children. Including them in the search strategy may have led to an overrepresentation of these illnesses and an underrepresentation of less common conditions. Other SFIs might concern adults as much as children and treatment-seeking studies may not differentiate between age groups. Restricting the inclusion criteria to children under 5 may have introduced additional bias towards malaria and pneumonia. Fever has commonly been used as a proxy for malaria in treatment-seeking studies in areas of high malaria transmission. With a reduction of transmission, non-malarial fevers will become more important (D'Acremont et al. 2014). This epidemiological transition might impact the association between treatment seeking and health outcomes of SFI, but also emphasizes the importance of a syndromic approach to understanding treatment seeking for SFI and fever in general. 43Chapter 4. Definitions of severity in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness 4.5.2 Conclusion The diversity of SFI definitions and treatment-seeking outcomes in treatment-seeking studies of febrile illness in children under 5 affects the comparability of the evidence in this field of research. However, we do not recommend a single definition or approach. For researchers who plan to conduct a treatment-seeking study, the focus should lie on defining the intention of their study and considering the different perspectives on illness concepts and treatment seeking relevant to their research. A non-normative understanding of illness and human behaviour is particularly important when little is known about treatment-seeking practices in the local communities and when interventions aiming at improving health practices and service provision need to be adapted to the local context. Quantitative research should apply knowledge gained through qualitative research and only be guided by normative assumptions when a health system perspective is more relevant than a community perspective. The lack of methodological rigor remains a concern in treatment-seeking studies. Limited information on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and ambiguities in reported treatment-seeking outcomes make it difficult to draw conclusions from the presented evidence and to make comparisons between studies. Due to limited information on the inclusion of dead children and study designs excluding dead children there is dearth of evidence on the differences in treatment-seeking pathways between children who survive and recover and children who die. This limits the validity of inferences made on the association of treatment-seeking pathways and health outcomes in children with SFI. High-quality community studies are needed to fill this research gap. 4.6 Declarations Author contributions NB conceived the study, conducted the literature search, screened citations and full-text articles for inclusion, coded, analyzed and interpreted the data, and wrote the manuscript.

Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral 5.1 Abstract Background: Children who receive pre-referral rectal artesunate (RAS) require urgent referral to a health facility where appropriate treatment for severe malaria can be provided. However, the rapid improvement of a child's condition after RAS administration may influence a caregiver's decision to follow this recommendation. Currently, the evidence on the effect of RAS on referral completion is limited. In this study, we investigated the relationship between RAS implementation and administration and referral completion. Methods and Findings: An observational study accompanied the roll-out of RAS in three malaria endemic settings in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nigeria and Uganda. Community health workers and primary health centres enrolled children under five years with suspected severe malaria before and after the roll-out of RAS. All children were followed up 28 days after enrolment to assess their treatment-seeking pathways, treatments received, and their health outcome. In total, 8,365 children were enrolled, 77% of whom fulfilled all inclusion criteria and had a known referral completion status. Referral completion was 67% (1,408/2,104) in DRC, 48% (287/600) in Nigeria and 58% (2,170/3,745) in Uganda. In DRC and Uganda, RAS users were less likely to complete referral than RAS non-users in the pre-roll-out phase (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.48, and aOR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.58-0.88, respectively). Among children seeking care from a primary health centre in Nigeria, RAS users were less likely to complete referral compared to RAS non-users in the post-roll-out phase (aOR = 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.71). In Uganda, among children who completed referral, RAS users were significantly more likely to complete referral on time than RAS non-users enrolled in the pre-roll-out phase (aOR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.17-2.79). Conclusions: The findings of this study raise legitimate concerns that the roll-out of RAS may lead to lower referral completion in children who were administered pre-referral RAS. To ensure that community-based programmes are effectively implemented, barriers to referral completion need to be addressed at all levels. Alternative effective treatment options should be provided to children unable to complete referral. 47Chapter 5. Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral completion 5.2 Introduction Rectal artesunate (RAS) is a potentially life-saving pre-referral treatment for children presenting at the primary health care level with suspected severe malaria (Gomes et al. 2009). Current guidelines require that children who received RAS be referred immediately to a health facility where comprehensive management of severe malaria can be provided (World Health Organization 2018a). However, the rapid improvement of a child's condition after the administration of RAS (Gomes et al. 2008) may result in children not being taken to a referral health facility (RHF) where appropriate treatment is available (Simba et al. 2010). According to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, appropriate post-referral treatment of severe malaria consists of an intramuscular or intravenous antimalarial for at least 24 hours followed by a full course of an oral artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and accompanied by the management of clinical complications (World Health Organization 2015b). Previous studies on RAS and referral defined referral completion as going to the nearest health facility, irrespective of the facility's capacity to treat severe malaria (Ajayi et al. 2016; Siribi\u00b4 e et al. 2016; Mvumbi et al. 2019; Simba et al. 2010; Simba et al. 2009; Strachan et al. 2018). In the case of children first treated with RAS by a community health worker (CHW), this may be a primary health centre (PHC) that lacks the capacity to manage a severe malaria episode. In view of improving the case management of such children, more evidence is needed to understand the pathways by which children with suspected severe malaria reach a competent and capacitated health care provider and whether referral completion is impacted by the administration of RAS. There is evidence that children who received pre-referral treatment were less likely to complete referral than children without treatment prior to referral (Lal et al. 2018; Nanyonjo et al. 2015). However, this kind of evidence for RAS as a pre-referral treatment is scarce. Most previous quantitative studies on RAS and referral completion did not compare RAS users versus non-RAS users (Ajayi et al. 2016; Lal et al. 2018; Simba et al. 2009; Siribi\u00b4 e et al. 2016; Warsame et al. 2016), and thus did not estimate the potential effect of RAS administration on referral completion. Only one observational study tested for non-inferiority of referral completion among children receiving RAS compared to children not receiving RAS (Mvumbi et al. 2019). The authors concluded non-inferiority because the pre-defined margin of 15% was not reached; however, referral completion in RAS users (84%) was lower than in non-RAS users (94%). In addition, the analysis did not control for other factors influencing referral completion. Factors that have previously been shown to influence referral completion are household dynamics and priorities, illness severity, the type of referring provider, the performance and result of 48Chapter 5. Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral completion diagnostic tests prior to referral, health workers' communication skills, distance to the RHF, referral and treatment costs, and the perceived quality of the RHF (de Zoysa et al. 1998; Kalter et al. et 2018; Mvumbi et al. 2019; Nanyonjo et al. 2015; Simba et al. 2009; Simba et al. 2010; Strachan et al. 2018; Thomson et al. 2011; Warsame et al. 2016). The Community Access to Rectal Artesunate for Malaria (CARAMAL) project included an observational study accompanying the implementation of RAS in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nigeria and Uganda and is described in detail in a companion paper (Lengeler et al. see Appendix 1). The training provided to CHW and staff of PHCs during the roll-out of RAS emphasised the need to refer severely sick children to an appropriate and recognised RHF capable of managing the child's severe condition, rather than to the nearest or next-higher level provider. This manuscript aimed to assess referral completion of children with suspected severe malaria and its relationship with RAS implementation and administration, taking into consideration other factors influencing referral completion. The key study results are described elsewhere (Hetzel et al. 2021, see Chapter 7) and the treatment patterns in the RHF are described by Signorell et al. (manuscript in preparation). 5.3 Methods 5.3.1 Study design This observational study followed the implementation of pre-referral RAS in three study areas in DRC, Nigeria and Uganda. Local health authorities in collaboration with UNICEF trained community-based providers on the use and administration of rectal artesunate. Community-based providers enrolled children under five years of age with fever and danger signs according to the national integrated Community Case Management (iCCM, in the case of CHW) or children diagnosed with severe malaria in the case of PHCs, some of them following the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines. All eligible children were followed up one month after enrolment by dedicated research staff. The study period covered approximately ten months before the implementation of RAS (pre-roll-out: May 2018 - February 2019) and 17 months thereafter (post-roll-out: March 2019 - August 2020). 49Chapter 5. Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral completion 5.3.2 Study setting The study was conducted in three districts in Uganda (Kole, Oyam, Kwania), three Local Government Areas (LGA) in Adamawa State in Nigeria (Fufore, Song, Mayo-Belwa) and three health zones in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kenge, Kingandu, Ipamu). The overall study population was 2.5 million of which 476,000 (19%) were children under 5 years. Further details are provided elsewhere (Lengeler et al. see Appendix 1). The public health system in the study areas consisted of several levels of community-based providers and at least one level of RHFs (Table 5.1). Community-based providers implementing pre-referral RAS included CHWs and PHCs. In the study health zones in DRC, CHWs were located in communities with no formal provider within a distance of 5km. In the study LGAs in Nigeria, CHWs were located in communities that were more than 5km away from a public health facility, or the community was hard to reach due to bad road conditions or natural barriers like rivers or mountains. In the study districts in Uganda, there were two CHWs per village irrespective of the presence of other formal health care providers.

In the case of CHWs, these are often PHCs (e.g. in Uganda, a Village Health Team may refer a child to a Health Centre II). During RAS roll-out, community- based providers who were trained in the administration of pre-referral RAS were instructed to refer children immediately to a designated RHF. The importance of speedy referral was emphasized in the training. Simultaneously, UNICEF implemented behaviour change communication campaigns that informed caregivers about the benefits of RAS and the importance of referral completion. In Uganda and DRC, there were no interventions in place to support referral to a RHF. In Nigeria, an Emergency Transport System for severely ill children was introduced in July 2019, shortly after the implementation of RAS. 50Chapter 5. Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral completion 5.3.3 Data collection Local research partners established a patient surveillance system for the enrolment and follow-up of children with suspected severe malaria presenting to CHWs or PHCs in DRC and Nigeria, and to CHWs in Uganda. Children were enrolled if they were under five years, had a history of fever and at least one danger sign for which RAS is indicated as per national iCCM and IMCI guidelines. Upon enrolment, community-based providers conducted a malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) for study purposes. After referring the child to a higher-level provider, the enrolling provider reported the case to the local study office where eligible children were recorded in a central case register. In Nigeria and Uganda, this contact happened via telephone. In DRC, community-based providers were regularly visited by CARAMAL research staff to record provisionally enrolled children in the central case register. Dedicated CARAMAL staff were stationed in RHFs in the study area to record the post- referral management of referred children who were admitted for treatment. CARAMAL research staff scheduled an interview 28 days after enrolment. Deceased children were followed up two months after enrolment to respect the mourning period. At the follow-up visit, caregivers or other knowledgeable family members provided information on signs and symptoms, treatment-seeking history, diagnosis and treatment during the child's illness episode. The interviewer also recorded the geo-coordinates of the home location of the child. Additional information on the child's condition and administered treatment upon enrolment was obtained from the enrolling provider. Data was collected electronically on tablets with ODK Collect (https://opendatakit.org/). During admission, CARAMAL research staff at RHFs recorded information on case management on paper forms before entering it into ODK Collect. The password protected ODK Aggregate server was hosted at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Switzerland. 5.3.4 Outcomes and explanatory variables The primary outcome of this analysis was referral completion, defined as a child being brought to one of the designated RHFs at any stage during the treatment-seeking process, after seeing a community- based provider, as reported by the caregiver or by CARAMAL staff stationed at the RHF. Secondary outcomes included going to any other public provider after seeing a community-based provider and going to a provider outside of the public health system after seeing a community-based provider. A further secondary outcome was timely referral completion defined as reaching a RHF on the same or next day after enrolment. The number of days between enrolment and reaching a RHF was either 51Chapter 5. Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral completion calculated as the difference between the enrolment date and the date of admission at a RHF, or obtained from the treatment-seeking narrative as reported by the caregiver during follow-up. The main exposures of interest were the RAS implementation phases (pre-roll-out vs. post-roll-out) and pre-referral RAS administration in the post-roll-out phase. To assess these effects, we grouped children into three study groups: 1) pre-RAS, 2) RAS non-users in the post-RAS phase and 3) RAS users in the post-RAS phase. We accounted for age and sex of the child and the interviewed caregiver, and the child's place of residence (health zone/LGA/district). The severity as perceived by the caregiver and the presence of a danger sign involving the central nervous system (CNS; convulsions, unusually sleepy, or unconscious) were proxies for disease severity. Additional factors considered included the mRDT result at enrolment, the type of community-based provider (CHW vs. PHC), the season, day of enrolment (workday vs. weekend), enrolment during the Covid-19 pandemic (April 1st, 2020 or later), treatment-seeking delay between the onset of illness and going to the enrolling provider, the means of transport to enrolling provider, travel time between home and nearest RHF and the administration of home treatment before presentation to enrolling provider. To calculate the travel time between the home of the child and the nearest RHF, we used the Malaria Atlas Project friction surface 2015 (Weiss et al. 2018) with a 100 m x 100 m resolution. The calculation was done in RStudio (RStudio Team 2020) using the method described by Bertozzi-Villa (2018). Geolocations of RHFs were obtained from the CARAMAL Health Care Provider Surveys for RHFs within the study area and from Maina et al. (2019) for RHFs surrounding the study area. All geolocations were verified using Google Maps (Google n.d.) and official government sources, where applicable (Uganda Ministry of Health 2018; Nigeria Federal Ministry fo Health n.d.). 5.3.5 Statistical analysis For each country, we used a logistic regression model to estimate the association of the implementation of RAS and RAS administration with referral completion. For children completing referral, we used logistic regression models to estimate the association between RAS implementation and administration and referral timeliness. All models included the enrolling PHC or CHW as random effects to account for clustering at that level. Exposure variables were selected based on rational grounds prior to analysis and included in the final model irrespective of their level of significance. Variables to test for interactions were chosen a priori. The interactions included in the final model were significant at the 5% level. Observations with missing values for referral completion were excluded from the regression analysis. Statistical analyses were performed in Stata SE 16.1 (StataCorps 2019). 52Chapter 5. Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral completion 5.3.6 Ethics The community-based providers informed caregivers about the CARAMAL study prior to enrolment and caregivers gave oral pre-consent to be contacted for a follow-up interview. We obtained written consent from all caregivers of provisionally enrolled children either at the RHF or before the follow-up interview 28 days after enrolment. The CARAMAL study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Review Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO ERC, No. ERC.0003008), the Ethics Committee of the University of Kinshasa School of Public Health (No. 012/2018), the Health Research Ethics Committee of the Adamawa State Ministry of Health (S/MoH/1131/I), the National Health Research Ethics Committee of Nigeria (NHREC/01/01/2007-05/05/2018), the Higher Degrees, Research and Ethics Committee of the Makerere University School of Public Health (No. 548), the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST, No. SS 4534), and the Scientific and Ethical Review Committee of CHAI (No. 112, 21 Nov 2017). The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03568344). 53Chapter 5. Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral completion 5.4 Results 5.4.1 Study population Between May 2018 and August 2020, community-based providers provisionally enrolled 8,365 children (Appendix 3: Figure A.1 & Figure A.2). The study team successfully followed up 7,593 (91%) children and obtained informed consent. Of those, 6,505 (78%) children fulfilled all inclusion criteria of which 6,449 had a known referral status (77%). The majority of included children were enrolled after the implementation of RAS (n=4,396, 68%). Particularly in DRC, the sample receiving RAS in the post- RAS phase was substantially larger (N = 1,548) compared to the other two study groups (pre-RAS: N = 368; post-RAS non-users: N = 188) (Table 5.2). In Nigeria, the sample sizes across study groups were balanced (Table 5.3). In Uganda, the number of children enrolled in the pre-RAS phase (N = 1,479) was comparable to the number of children receiving RAS in the post-RAS phase (N = 1,631); however, the number of children not receiving RAS in the post-RAS phase was substantially smaller (N = 635) (Table 5.4). Within each country, the age and sex distribution were similar among children enrolled in the pre-RAS phase, RAS users and non-users in the post-RAS phase. In Nigeria, there were fewer children under one year than in the other countries. Danger signs involving the CNS were most common in Uganda followed by Nigeria and DRC. In all countries, more than 90% of eligible children tested positive for malaria at enrolment. In DRC, eligible children were almost exclusively enrolled by PHCs (95%), while in Uganda all children were enrolled by CHWs. In Nigeria, a higher proportion of children were enrolled by CHWs in the pre-RAS phase (72%) compared to the post-RAS phase (42%). In the post-RAS phase, between 19% (Uganda) and 30% (Nigeria) of the children were enrolled during the Covid-19 pandemic. In all countries, the proportion of children receiving RAS was higher during the Covid-19 pandemic. 54Chapter 5.

Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral completion 5.4.2 Referral completion In DRC, overall 1,408 (67%) children completed referral to a designated RHF. Few children went to another public provider (6%) or to any other provider (3%). In Nigeria, 287 (48%) children completed referral to a designated RHF. An additional 21% of the children went to another public provider and only 4% of the children went to a non-public provider. In Uganda, 2,170 (58%) of the children completed referral to the designated RHFs. Going to another public provider was infrequent (9%), but 29% of the children in Uganda were brought to providers outside of the public health system. In all countries, referral completion to a RHF was slightly lower among RAS users compared to RAS non-users in the post-RAS phase (Figure 5.1). In DRC and Uganda, referral completion in the post-RAS phase was comparable to referral completion in the pre-RAS phase. Meanwhile in Nigeria, referral completion increased from the pre-RAS to the post-RAS phase. The difference between the pre-RAS and post-RAS phase was mainly driven by PHC enrolments being substantially more likely to complete referral to a RHF than CHW enrolments, in combination with an increase in the number of PHC enrolments in the post-RAS phase (Figure 5.2). In both DRC and Nigeria, going to any other provider than a RHF was uncommon for PHC enrolments; but seemed more common for CHW enrolments who frequently went to a public provider other than a designated RHF (Figure 5.2). In Uganda, children rarely went to another public provider but tended instead to go to a private provider, compensating the lower referral completion to a RHF in the two post-RAS study groups (Figure 5.1). 58Chapter 5. Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral completion FIGURE 5.1: Post-referral treatment seeking by country and study group. RHF = referral health facility, RAS = rectal artesunate. FIGURE 5.2: Post-referral treatment seeking by enrolment location and study group, in DRC and Nigeria.

Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral completion In DRC and Uganda, referral completion was lower in the post-RAS phase compared to the pre-RAS phase after adjusting for other factors, irrespective of whether children had received RAS (Table 5.5 & Table 5.6). The opposite occurred in Nigeria, where referral completion in the post-RAS phase irrespective of RAS use was higher compared to the pre-RAS phase (Table 5.7). When taking RAS non-users in the post-RAS phase as a reference, the odds of completing referral did not significantly differ between children not receiving RAS and children receiving RAS in DRC (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-2.35) and Uganda (aOR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.70-1.16). In Nigeria, the same was true for children enrolled by a CHW (aOR = 2.51, 95% CI 0.76-8.24); however, among children enrolled by a PHC, those who had received RAS were significantly less likely to complete referral than those not receiving RAS in the post-RAS phase (aOR = 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.71). Besides RAS implementation and RAS administration, we found other factors significantly associated with referral completion. In all countries, increasing travel time to the RHF had a negative effect on referral completion. In DRC and Nigeria, children were more likely to complete referral if they were referred by a PHC compared to a CHW (not applicable in Uganda). Other factors that had a positive effect on referral completion included being perceived fatally ill by the caregiver (DRC), having received home treatment (DRC) or being enrolled on a workday (Uganda). Factors with a negative effect on referral completion included having a CNS danger sign (DRC) or being enrolled during the Covid-19 pandemic (Nigeria). The adjusted odds ratios did not differ substantially from the unadjusted estimates except for the effect of the malaria test result in DRC and being enrolled by a PHC in Nigeria. Unadjusted estimates are provided in Appendix 3 (Table A.2 - Table A.4). 60Chapter 5.

Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral completion 5.4.3 Referral timeliness Of the 3,865 children that completed referral to a RHF, data on the timeliness of referral completion was available for 3,598 children (93%) (Appendix 3: Figure A.1 & Figure A.2). Timely referral completion to a RHF on the same or next day after seeing a community-based provider was 76% in DRC, 86% in Nigeria and 92% in Uganda. In all countries, timely referral was highest among children receiving RAS in the post-RAS phase; however, the differences between study groups were rather small (Figure 5.3). After adjusting for other factors, children in Uganda receiving RAS in the post-RAS phase were significantly more likely to complete referral on time than children in the pre-RAS phase (OR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.17-2.79). Other comparisons between study groups were not significant in any of the countries. Complete tables with denominators and regression results are presented in Appendix 3 (Table A.5 - Table A.7). FIGURE 5.3: Timely referral completion, by country and study group, on the same or next day after referral by a community-based provider, of all patients completing referral to a referral health facility. RAS = rectal artesunate. 64Chapter 5. Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral completion 5.5 Discussion After the administration of pre-referral RAS, current guidelines recommend referral completion to a health facility where intramuscular or intravenous treatment is available (World Health Organization 2015b). Findings from previous studies on RAS and referral completion were mostly reassuring; however, the effect of RAS on referral completion was either not adjusted for other factors (Mvumbi et al. 2019) or did not compare RAS users to non-users (Ajayi et al. 2016; Lal et al. 2018; Simba et al. 2009; Siribi\u00b4 e et al. 2016; Warsame et al. 2016). Additionally, none of the studies took into consideration that the nearest health facility might not have the capacity of administering parenteral antimalarial treatment. The CARAMAL Project for the first time provides adjusted estimates of the effect of RAS on referral completion to a RHF at which, according to national policy, appropriate post-referral treatment is available. Post-referral treatment with an injectable antimalarial followed by a full course of ACT ensures that children are effectively treated for severe malaria, and RAS (and parenteral artemisinin) is not applied as a monotherapy, thereby reducing the risk of the development and selection of artemisinin-resistant parasites (World Health Organization 2015b). This study provides evidence that the large-scale introduction and use of RAS can affect referral completion. In DRC and Uganda, referral completion was lower in the post-roll-out phase compared to the pre-roll-out phase. In Nigeria, the opposite was the case. However, in Nigeria, children who were administered RAS in a PHC were less likely to complete referral to a RHF than children who did not receive RAS. Referral completion by children attending a PHC in Nigeria and DRC was consistently higher when compared to the referral completion of children attending a CHW (not applicable in Uganda). In all countries, children living a greater distance from a RHF (measured in the time it would take to travel to the facility) were significantly less likely to complete referral than those living in the vicinity of the facility. In all countries, the majority of children that completed referral to a RHF did so on the same or next day after being referred. The findings of this study raise legitimate concerns that the roll-out of RAS may lead to lower referral completion in children who were administered pre-referral RAS. The comparison of RAS users and RAS non-users in the post-roll-out phase in Nigeria strongly suggests that RAS administration negatively affected referral completion of children enrolled in a PHC. In DRC, a comparison of RAS users versus non-users in the post-roll-out phase was limited by the comparatively small number of non-users. Therefore, the significantly lower referral completion of RAS users compared to the referral completion of children enrolled in the pre-roll-out phase may indicate that referral completion was negatively affected by RAS administration; even though other causal links cannot be excluded. The 65Chapter 5. Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral completion reason for a decrease in referral completion after RAS use is most likely the rapid improvement of children after RAS administration, a result of the fast reduction of the parasite to blood concentration and the drug's antipyretic effect (Awad et al. 2003; Barnes et al. 2004; Krishna et al. 2001; Simpson et al. 2006). Considering that treatment seeking is often delayed due to lack of transport and money (Desmond et al. 2013; Dillip et al. 2012; Hildenwall et al. 2008; Lambiris et al. manuscript in preparation), the child's condition may have improved in the meantime. In such a situation, a caregiver is likely to balance between the referral recommendation and priorities at home, in addition to expenses for transport and those that would be incurred at the RHF (Simba et al. 2010). Obviously, such a practice raises the concern that children may not receive the appropriate post-referral treatment with potentially fatal consequences. Measures to improve referral completion must take into consideration the actual capacity of RHFs to provide appropriate case management for severe malaria. As opposed to previous studies, this study considered referral to be completed only if the patient arrived at a RHF with the capacity to manage severe malaria cases. However, an analyses of the quality of care at RHFs in the CARAMAL study areas found that the treatment of children with severe malaria was often inadequate (Signorell et al. manuscript in preparation). Meanwhile, some children sought post-referral treatment from a lower-level public or from a non-public provider. Considering that referral completion did not improve the health outcome of children enrolled in the CARAMAL study in DRC and Uganda (Hetzel et al. 2021, see Chapter 7), sufficient treatment may have been provided by non-RHF providers (see Chapter 6). It is also possible that less severely sick children recover faster and are hence less likely to be brought to a RHF after pre-referral RAS treatment. Therefore, children with suspected severe malaria first attending a community-based provider may not always require treatment at the level of RHFs. However, recognizing such children with a more moderate form of severe malaria remains a challenge. The finding that a substantial proportion of children (33-52%) did not complete referral emphasizes the need to address referral-related barriers at all levels: sensitizing caregivers, properly training community-based health care providers, facilitating access to and increasing trust in RHFs. Such a package of supportive interventions accompanying the roll-out of RAS in Zambia has previously been shown to reduce the mortality of children with severe malaria (Green et al. 2019). In a trial conducted by Gomes et al. (2009), RAS had a protective effect in the context of high completion of referral (though not necessarily to a RHF in the African sites). In the CARAMAL study in Nigeria, the implementation of an Emergency Transport System most likely increased referral completion, and referral completion significantly improved the health outcomes of children with suspected severe 66Chapter 5. Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral completion malaria in this country. The available evidence strongly indicates that community-based programmes should always be accompanied by measures strengthening referral. Irrespective of the effort to strengthen referral, it is important to acknowledge that some caregivers to children may delay or not complete referral. Therefore, the training materials and referral guidelines for community-based providers need to emphasize the importance of a close follow-up of severely sick children, if necessary at their home. If referral cannot be completed or is refused by the caregiver, the treatment with pre-referral drugs should be continued. Such a recommendation already exists for RAS until oral treatment with an ACT is tolerated (World Health Organization 2018a). Similarly, the WHO recommends that CHWs continue administering amoxicillin to children with pneumonia with chest in-drawing if referral is not feasible (World Health Organization 2014b). Sufficient stocks of pre-referral drugs are therefore essential for providing adequate care to children unable to complete referral. Referral completion to a RHF was a problem particularly among CHW enrolments in DRC and Nigeria. Unlike in Uganda, CHWs in these two countries are placed in especially hard-to-reach areas. In our analyses, we accounted for difficulties in geographical access to a RHF (availability of transport and travel time to RHF), but we may have missed additional barriers to accessing a RHF. Another explanation could be that children attending a PHC are more severely ill than children attending a CHW (Lee et al. manuscript in preparation). Caregivers may be more likely to make increased efforts to reach the first provider as well as to complete referral if the child is more severely ill. Meanwhile, irrespective of the reasons, an active follow up of children at home seems to be particularly important in the most hard-to-reach places where referral completion is the least likely. As community programmes continue to be the preferred approach to extend health services to remote communities, the challenges associated with these hard-to-reach places need to be acknowledged in referral and treatment guidelines and the promotion of best practices. Even though treatment-seeking practices including referral are highly contextual, some recommendations based on the results of this study can be generalised to other settings. That is, programmes implementing RAS need to consider the potential effects on referral completion. More generally, community-based programmes should be supported by measures facilitating referral completion, and provide a back-up option for those children who fail to complete referral. Alternative treatment options are particularly important in hard-to-reach places. This study has several strengths. First, it covered three different contexts with varying intensities of malaria transmission, access to health care, and differences in the implementation of iCCM/IMCI 67Chapter 5. Pre-referral rectal artesunate and referral completion policies (Lengeler et al. see Appendix 1). Secondly, the study was community-based and enrolled a large number of children with severe febrile illness from remote communities. Large community- based studies in far-to-reach places are mostly cross-sectional surveys that rarely capture severe illness episodes because of their low incidence, and always exclude children that are deceased, resulting in a lack of understanding of severe illnesses at community level (Brunner, Awor, and Hetzel 2021, see Chapter 4). Thirdly, the study achieved a high follow-up rate, thereby reducing the risk of selection bias. This study comes with several limitations. First, the low enrolment numbers of children not receiving RAS in the post-roll-out phase did not allow a clear conclusion about the effects of RAS administration on referral completion after the roll-out of RAS in DRC. Secondly, the enrolment strategy in Nigeria and Uganda may have introduced selection bias. The notification of enrolments from the enrolling provider to the local study office depended on a contact via mobile phone. Thus, the study may have excluded systematically children in the most remote places because of unstable network coverage. It is likely that these children would have also been the least likely to complete referral leading to an overestimation of referral completion in our study. Thirdly, the observational design and the retrospective data collection 28 days after enrolment did not allow for direct causal inferences. 5.6 Conclusion Providing prompt and appropriate health care to severely sick children in remote communities remains a challenge. Children in hard-to-reach places are the least likely to complete referral after seeing a community-based provider. In addition, referral completion may further be negatively affected by the administration of RAS. To ensure that community-based programmes are effectively implemented, barriers to referral completion need to be addressed at all levels. Alternative effective treatment options should be provided to children unable to complete referral. 68Chapter 5.

Treatment-seeking pathways of children with suspected severe malaria 6.1 Abstract Introduction: Community health workers (CHW) usually refer children with suspected severe malaria to the nearest public health facility or a designated public referral health facility (RHF). Caregivers do not always follow this recommendation. This study aims at identifying post-referral treatment-seeking pathways that lead to appropriate antimalarial treatment for children less than five years with suspected severe malaria. Methods: An observational study in Uganda enrolled children below five years presenting to CHWs with signs of severe malaria. Children were followed up 28 days after enrolment to assess their condition and treatment-seeking history, including referral advice and provision of antimalarial treatment from visited providers. Results: Of 2,211 children fulfilling all inclusion criteria, 96% visited a second provider after attending a CHW. The majority of CHWs recommended caregivers to take their child to a designated RHF (65%); however, only 59% followed this recommendation. Many children were brought to a private clinic (33%), even though CHWs rarely recommended this type of provider (3%). Children who were brought to a private clinic were more likely to receive an injection than children brought to a RHF (78% vs 51%, p <0.001) and more likely second Children who only went to non-RHF providers were less likely to receive an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) than children who attended a RHF (odds ratio [OR] = 0.64, 95% CI 0.51-0.79, p <0.001). Children who did not go to any provider after seeing a CHW were the least likely to receive an ACT (OR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.14-0.34, p <0.001). Conclusions: Health policies should consider local treatment-seeking practices and ensure adequate quality of care at providers where caregivers of children with suspected severe malaria actually seek care. 71Chapter 6. Treatment-seeking pathways of children with suspected severe malaria 6.2 Introduction Despite major reductions since the year 2000, malaria is still a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years of age, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (GBD 2019 Diseases and Injuries Collaborators 2020). Particularly children in remote areas with little access to health care are at increased risk of dying (Coetzer and Adeola 2020; Karra, Fink, and Canning 2017). To address this problem, the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and others have developed an equity-focused strategy called integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) (Young et al. 2012). Within the framework of iCCM programmes, community health workers (CHW) are trained to treat children less than 5 years with uncomplicated malaria, and to identify and refer children with fever and danger signs indicative of severe malaria. If available, CHWs may treat children with suspected severe malaria with a single dose of pre-referral rectal artesunate (RAS) (Medicines for Malaria Venture 2016). The WHO treatment guidelines for malaria recommend that children who receive pre-referral treatment be referred to a health facility where appropriate post-referral treatment for severe malaria is available (World Health Organization 2021d). The administration of the recommended post-referral treatment with an injectable antimalarial for at least 24 hours followed by a three-day course with an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) depends on the confirmation of the severe malaria diagnosis by the post-referral provider. If confirmed, the WHO recommended parenteral antimalarial consists of intravenous or intramuscular artesunate. If artesunate is not available, severe malaria patients may be treated with intramuscular artemether or, as the least preferred option, intramuscular or intravenous quinine. However, the post-referral provider may not always diagnose referred children with severe malaria. If the post-referral provider diagnoses uncomplicated malaria, a three-day course with an ACT may be sufficient. Locally adapted recommendations on appropriate referral facilities should ensure that children with suspected severe malaria are sent to a post-referral provider where appropriate treatment for severe malaria is available (Medicines for Malaria Venture 2016). CHWs are usually trained to refer to a health facility affiliated with the public health system, either the nearest or a designated referral facility (Ajayi et al. 2016; Brunner et al. 2021; Lal et 2018; Mvumbi et al. 2019; Nanyonjo et al. 2015; al. 2009; Siribi\u00b4 e et al. 2016; Warsame et al. 2016). Previous studies found that CHWs normally referred in line with local referral guidance; yet, caregivers did not always follow the CHW's referral recommendation (Nanyonjo et al. 2015; Simba et al. 2009). Factors that were negatively associated with referral completion were the administration of a pre-referral treatment, 72Chapter 6. Treatment-seeking pathways of children with suspected severe malaria referrals on the weekend or at night, costs associated with seeking treatment, the distance to the recommended health facility, and perceived low quality of care at the recommended facility (de Zoysa et al. 1998; Lal et al. 2018; Nanyonjo et al. 2015; Simba et al. 2010; Strachan et al. 2018). On the other hand, children with signs of severe illness or high perceived severity were more likely to complete referral (Lal et al. 2018; Mvumbi et al. 2019; Nanyonjo et al. 2015; Simba 2009; Strachan et al. 2018). Alternative post-referral treatment-seeking pathways often involved private providers (Nanyonjo et al. 2015; Simba et al. 2009); however, whether non-adherence to official referral guidance and/or CHW's referral advice led to inappropriate post-referral treatment was not part of these investigations. Therefore, these studies did not associate referral completion with an effectiveness measure of post-referral treatment seeking and treatment. To understand which post-referral treatment-seeking pathways lead to appropriate and effective malaria treatment for children with suspected severe malaria, investigations of post-referral processes do not only need to take into consideration treatment seeking but the whole continuum of referral recommendations, adherence, treatment seeking, and administration of post-referral treatment. Conversely, a comprehensive descriptive approach allows recognizing shortfalls in treatment effectiveness along treatment-seeking pathways of children with suspected severe malaria. In this study, we aim at identifying treatment-seeking pathways that lead to the appropriate management of suspected severe malaria in children after initial treatment seeking from a CHW. We compare referral recommendations with actual post-referral treatment-seeking actions to understand to what extent CHWs and caregivers deviate from the official recommendations. Finally, we describe the reasons for selecting different types of post-referral providers to gain an insight into the motivations of caregivers to follow or disregard referral recommendations. 6.3 Methods 6.3.1 Study design The data for this observational study was obtained from the Community Access to Rectal Artesunate for Malaria (CARAMAL) project, an operational research project accompanying the large-scale roll- out of RAS in Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Nigeria. In this analysis, we included data from Uganda collected after the implementation of RAS covering the period between April 2019 and August 2020. More details about the CARAMAL project and key results are described elsewhere (Lengeler et al. (see Appendix 1); Brunner et al. 2021 al. 2021 (see Chapter 7); Signorell et al. manuscript in preparation). 73Chapter 6. Treatment-seeking pathways of children with suspected severe malaria 6.3.2 Study setting The study area covered three districts in the Lango region in the north of Uganda. In 2018, Kole, Kwania, and Oyam districts comprised a population of almost 1 million of which around 20% were children under 5 years. In every village, two CHWs, locally called Village Health Team, provided close-to-home health care for children under 5 years with diarrhoea, pneumonia or malaria. The public health sector in the study districts consisted of 5,100 CHWs, 30 primary health centres (PHC, locally called Health Centre II), and 20 referral health facilities (RHF) which provided free malaria diagnosis and treatment for children under the age of 5 years. CHWs and PHCs were community- based providers that were trained in the administration of pre-referral RAS, and instructed to refer immediately to a designated RHF thereafter. RHFs were Health Centres III and IV or hospitals that had an inpatient ward and provided appropriate treatment for severe malaria including injectable antimalarials and ACTs. CHWs and public facilities were linked by a counter-referral system using a paper referral form to be taken to the post-referral provider by the caregiver and sent back to the CHW with information on final diagnosis and treatment. 6.3.3 Data collection CHWs enrolled children under 5 years with fever and at least one danger sign for which RAS was indicated as per Ugandan iCCM guidelines: unusually sleepy or unconscious, convulsions, inability to drink or feed anything, and persistent vomiting. For study purposes, CHWs tested eligible children with a malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT). CHWs notified the local study team of the new enrolment via a text message service hosted by the Ugandan Ministry of Health (mTrac). CARAMAL study nurses called the CHWs to confirm the eligibility of the child and schedule a follow up visit at the child's home 28 days after enrolment, or, in the case of death, two months in observance of a mourning period. Study nurses were also present at three Health Centre IVs and one hospital in the study districts to record post-referral case management of community-enrolled children admitted to the inpatient ward. During follow up, caregivers were interviewed about signs and symptoms, treatment-seeking history, diagnosis and treatment for their child's illness episode. On the same occasion, information on the child's condition and treatment administered was extracted from the CHW register. CARAMAL study nurses collected data electronically using ODK Collect (https://opendatakit.org/) installed on Android tablets. At RHFs, data was first collected on paper before being entered into 74Chapter 6. Treatment-seeking pathways of children with suspected severe malaria ODK Collect. The password protected ODK Aggregate server was hosted at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Switzerland. 6.3.4 Analysis In this analysis, we included children that fulfilled the iCCM eligibility criteria for RAS administration, were tested positive for malaria by any provider seen during the treatment-seeking process, died within 31 days after enrolment (if applicable), and for whom written informed consent was obtained. Children who were brought to another provider before seeing a CHW, whose caregiver did not list the enrolling CHW during the follow up interview, and for whom more than 50% of the data on treatment was missing were excluded. Treatment-seeking pathways and the administration of antimalarials along the treatment-seeking pathway were assessed based on the follow up interviews with caregivers. Reliability of caregiver reported data was found sufficient when comparing to data obtained from provider records (Appendix 4: Table A.8 and Table A.9). Health care providers were classified into RHFs, PHCs, CHWs, private clinics and drug shops. Antimalarial treatments of interest were RAS, antimalarial injections, and ACTs. For antimalarial injections, we used the administration of any injection as a proxy, after finding that receiving an injection according to the caregiver was predictive of receiving an injectable antimalarial according to RHF records (Appendix 4: Table A.9). The same assumption was made for non-RHF providers after finding that PHCs, private clinics and drug shops rarely administered injections other than antimalarials (Appendix 4: Table A.10). Antimalarial treatment was considered complete if a child received an ACT. In addition, we assessed the health status of children at follow up (dead/alive), referral recommendations by CHWs and adherence to these recommendations, and reasons for seeking post-referral treatment. The latter information was only available if the interviewed person was the same person who brought the child to the post-referral provider. For the treatment-seeking pathways and malaria case management, we used the effectiveness decay model for community health interventions and its pathways representation as Sankey diagrams (Karim et al. 2020). To build the Sankey diagram, we used Tableau Public (https://public.tableau.com). Indicators were calculated as absolute numbers and proportions. Proportions were compared by chi- square test accounting for clustering at parish level. We used a random effects logistic regression model to investigate the association of post-referral treatment seeking with receiving an ACT and 75Chapter 6. Treatment-seeking pathways of children with suspected severe malaria the health outcome of children. The models allowed for random intercepts for the parish of the home location of the child. Statistical analyses were conducted in Stata SE 16.1 (StataCorps 2019). 6.3.5 Ethics The CHWs informed caregivers about the CARAMAL study prior to enrolment and caregivers gave oral pre-consent to be contacted for a follow-up interview. We obtained written consent from all caregivers of provisionally enrolled children either at the RHF or before the follow-up interview 28 days after enrolment. The CARAMAL study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Review Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO ERC, No. ERC.0003008), the Higher Degrees, Research and Ethics Committee of the Makerere University School of Public Health (No. 548), the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST, No. SS 4534), and the Scientific and Ethical Review Committee of CHAI (No. 112, 21 Nov 2017). The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03568344). 76Chapter 6. Treatment-seeking pathways of children with suspected severe malaria 6.4 Results 6.4.1 Study population Of the 2675 provisionally enrolled children, 2,285 children (85%) could be successfully followed up and informed consent obtained (Appendix 4: Figure A.3). Of the 2,245 children (84%) that met all inclusion criteria, we excluded 34 children because of missing information or because they had been to another provider before going to a CHW. In total, 2,211 children (83%) were included in this analysis. The mean age of included children was 1.7 years (standard deviation [SD] = 1.2) and 1,169 children (53%) were male (Table 6.1). The most common danger sign was being unusually sleepy or unconscious (88%). Interviewed caregivers were on average 29 years old (SD = 9.4) and the majority of them were female (N=1,871, 85%). Inclusions were equally distributed across study districts. TABLE 6.1: Characteristics of participating children and interviewed caregivers 28 days post-enrolment.

Few children went to more than two providers (10%, N=2,211). Most of them were children who had previously been to a RHF (69%, N=223) or to a PHC (23%, N=223). Of those who continued to at least a third provider and 77Chapter 6. Treatment-seeking pathways of children with suspected severe malaria visited up to six providers, 126 (57%) went to a private clinic and 89 (40%) went to a RHF at some stage of the continued treatment-seeking pathway. 6.4.3 Administration of antimalarial treatment Among all children, 70% received RAS and 24% received an ACT from the enrolling CHW (Table 6.2). From the second provider, 1,168 children (55%) received an injection and 1426 (67%) received an ACT. Of the children receiving an injection, 534 (46%) received it from a RHF and 507 (43%) received it from a private clinic; but PHCs and drug shops also administered injections (Figure 6.1). Children who attended a private clinic as a second provider were more likely to receive an injection than children going to a RHF (78% vs. 51%, p <0.001), and among those receiving an injection, more likely to receive intramuscular artemether (22% (Appendix 4: Table A.10). The majority of children that received an injection also received an ACT (866/1,168=74%). Administration of an ACT without prior administration of an injectable was common among children going to a RHF (366/1,149=32%) and those going to a PHC (74/189=39%). Meanwhile, 272 children (13%) did not receive any antimalarial treatment from the second provider. These children more often continued to a third provider than children who had received antimalarial treatment at the second provider (47% vs. 5%). At the third and subsequent providers, both the administration of an injection (59%, N=223) and the administration of an ACT (45%, N=223) were common.

PHC = primary health centre, ACT = artemisinin-based combination therapy. 79Chapter 6. Treatment-seeking pathways of children with suspected severe malaria Taking into account complete treatment-seeking pathways, the administration of all three types of antimalarial treatments, RAS, injection and ACT, was common both for children who went to a RHF at some stage (41%, N=1,192) and for children who never went to a RHF (40%, N=927) (Table 6.3). However, children that were brought to a RHF were more likely to receive an ACT than children seeking post-referral care from non-RHF providers (odds ratio [OR] = 0.64, 95% CI 0.51-0.79, p <0.001). Children who did not go to any provider after seeing a CHW were the least likely to receive an ACT (OR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.14-0.34, p <0.001). In addition, they were more likely to die than children going to a RHF (OR = 5.97, 95% CI 1.80-19.78, p=0.003). Children who went to a non-RHF provider were less likely to die than children who had been to a RHF, but the difference was not significant (OR = 0.14, 95% CI 0.02-1.12, p=0.06). TABLE 6.3: Antimalarial drug administration if children went to referral health facility (RHF) at any stage of the treatment-seeking pathway, went to at least one other provider which was not a referral health facility (non-RHF provider), or did not go to any other provider after seeing the first provider.

The majority of CHWs recommended the caregiver to take their child to a RHF (65%). We could not determine the exact type of recommended post-referral provider for 344 children (16%) because of a lack of detail in the data. Few children were sent to a PHC (9%), a private clinic (3%), or a drug shop ( <1%). No CHW recommended referral to another CHW. Overall, adherence to the CHWs' recommendations was 60% (N=1,712). Adherence was comparable for children sent to a RHF (59%, N=1,439)) or to a PHC (59%, N=204), but was significantly higher among children sent to a private clinic (82%, N=65, p <0.001). The majority of children who did not adhere to the advice to go to a RHF or PHC went to a private clinic (463/593=78% and 47/84=46%, respectively) (Figure 6.2).

PHC = primary health centre 82Chapter 6. Treatment-seeking pathways of children with suspected severe malaria 6.4.5 Reasons for going to post-referral provider Most children who were brought to a RHF as a second provider (N=1,099) were taken there because the previous provider, i.e. the CHW, had referred them (83%) (Table 6.5). The same was true for the 179 children going to a PHC (87%). Besides being referred, the experience and professionalism of the provider were frequently mentioned reasons to attend a RHF (29%) or a PHC (31%). In contrast, being referred was substantially less frequently mentioned for the 659 children brought to a private clinic (24%). Meanwhile, knowing the provider was an important reason to go to a private clinic (49%). As for PHCs and RHFs, experience and professionalism of the provider played an important role (35%). Reasons for going to a third or subsequent provider were largely the same, except for children more often going to a private provider because they were referred there (39%, N=126) (Appendix 4: Table A.11).

Currently, the scientific literature lacks comprehensive analyses that relate post-referral treatment seeking to the appropriateness of post-referral antimalarial treatment. In this study, we present an investigation of treatment-seeking decisions taken by caregivers with a child with suspected severe malaria who attended a CHW in the north of Uganda, with a focus on antimalarial treatment administered along the treatment seeking-pathway. Almost all children went to a second provider after initial treatment seeking from a CHW. While the majority of CHWs recommended referral to a RHF, private clinics were a common choice for post-referral treatment seeking. Adherence to the referral recommendation was higher if CHW 83Chapter 6. Treatment-seeking pathways of children with suspected severe malaria recommended referral to a private clinic compared to the recommendation to either an RHF or PHC. In private clinics, children were more likely to receive an injection than in RHFs. Overall, the proportion of children receiving an ACT was high; however, children who never went to an RHF were significantly less likely to get an ACT. Children who did not seek post-referral treatment were more likely dead at follow up. Most caregivers who brought their child to an RHF did so due to the CHW's referral recommendation. Knowing the provider was the predominant reason for caregivers who brought their child to a private clinic. According to the results of this study, general access to formal health care services was not a problem in the study area in Northern Uganda; but quality of care should be improved. The finding of more than 20% of the children receiving an artemisinin monotherapy is particularly concerning as the establishment of artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum parasites in Uganda is now factual (Balikagala et al. 2021; Awor et al. manuscript in preparation). An urgent response is needed to mitigate the spread of resistance to the current first-line treatments for malaria. Based on the findings of this study, we suggest targeted interventions aiming at improving quality of care for children with suspected severe malaria while at the same time taking into consideration the local landscape of treatment-seeking pathways. First, increased efforts to assure completion of antimalarial treatment with an ACT are particularly important in the private sector. In the present study, children who never went to a RHF and did not receive an ACT were mainly children attending private clinics. However, the role of the private sector as a source of post-referral treatment is paradoxical. On one hand, referral to a private clinic may not be recommendable because quality of care in the private health sector has been a concern for a while now (Bosman and Cunningham 2018), mainly due to non-conformity with guidelines, lack of training and poor quality of drugs (ACTwatch Group et al. 2017; Awor et al. 2012; Buregyeya et al. al. 2016; O'Connell et al. 2011; Onwujekwe et al. 2009). In contrast, the advantage of training CHWs to refer to a health facility affiliated with the public health system is that official health authorities can control the level of training of the higher-level provider, and, in the case of a referral facility, the availability of appropriate and quality-assured severe malaria treatment. Additionally, next-level and referral facilities often provide supervision and drugs to CHWs (Bosch-Capblanch and Marceau 2014; Young et al. 2012), meaning that there is an established link between both providers, which may facilitate referral processes (Give et al. 2019). On the other hand, private facilities are often more accessible than public facilities (Bosch-Capblanch and Marceau 2014; Konde-Lule et al. 2010; Rutebemberwa et al. 2009), and their presence can improve access to health care for children who otherwise would be left untreated (Brunner et al. 2021). Additionally, the results of this study 84Chapter 6. Treatment-seeking pathways of children with suspected severe malaria suggest that RHFs referred children to private clinics where at least some of them must have received an ACT. The reason for further referral may have been ACT stock-outs at the RHF (Mikkelsen-Lopez et al. 2013; Mpimbaza et al. 2019). Consequently, the private sector would in fact contribute to the appropriateness of post-referral treatment for children who first complete referral to a RHF. However, this interpretation must be taken with caution. There was anecdotal evidence of RHF health workers sometimes referring patients to their private drug shop or clinic, despite available drug stocks at the RHF. Similar reasons for referral have previously been reported in Tanzania (Mikkelsen-Lopez et al. 2013). In the fight against artemisinin resistance, strategies to support health workers' compliance with guidelines and policies are crucial in both the public and private sector. Second, follow-ups of children by CHWs only hours after referral should be encouraged in order to assure completion of malaria treatment with an ACT (Medicines for Malaria Venture 2016). There were few children that did not go to any provider other than the initial CHW provider, but their chance of not receiving an ACT was substantially higher compared to children going to a RHF or another non-RHF provider. Some of these cases could have most likely been avoided if CHWs had consistently followed up children at home, and had treated the children with RAS (if needed) and an ACT if referral was refused by the caregiver or deemed impossible. Importantly, sufficient stocks of RAS and ACTs are a prerequisite for a functioning follow-up system that contributes to improving the quality of care for children who do not seek post-referral treatment. Children who did not seek post-referral treatment were also more likely to die. However, interpretations should be taken with caution. These might have been children that died shortly after being attended by the CHW with no time to seek further care. Third, the counter-referral system, where referral forms are returned to the CHW should be strengthened. In addition to ensuring post-treatment data, receiving streamlined information on post-referral treatments and the final diagnosis provides an improved learning experience for CHWs, which may eventually lead to an improvement in distinguishing non-severe from severe cases. In this study, several children were treated with an ACT only at the post-referral provider, especially at RHFs, suggesting that some of these cases could have been managed at community level. Reducing referrals of non-severely ill children can contribute to decreasing out-of-pocket expenditures related to health care seeking (Mpimbaza et al. 2019). It is important to note that follow-ups of children at home to verify referral and to complete the counter referral process lead to a higher workload for CHWs. Even though CHWs are often community members without formal work engagements, taking care of the community's sick children comes with 85Chapter 6. Treatment-seeking pathways of children with suspected severe malaria opportunity costs for taking care of their own households (child care, farming etc.) (Kasteng et al. 2016; Schurer et al. 2020). To compensate CHWs for their investments, recommendations to formalize iCCM programmes and pay CHWs have been made in the past and emphasized again more recently (Global Health Workforce Alliance and World Health Organization 2010; World Health Organization 2021b). In Uganda, attempts into this direction have been made; however, so far with little success (Awor et al. 2021). Considering the deprived state of remote communities, strategies to improve access should not be to the disadvantage of those they are claiming to help. Third, investments into the supply side should be complemented by the removal of barriers to appropriate treatment on the demand side. Effective strategies may be educating caregivers on the importance of ACT administration after injectable antimalarials (Banek et al. 2021), and making antimalarials more affordable in the private sector. In Uganda, ACTs are subsidized through the private sector co-payment mechanism (CPM) (ACTwatch Group et al. 2017). However, the funding for CPM has been reduced significantly since 2017 (World Health Organization 2019b). In 2018, quality-assured ACTs in the private sector were more expensive than non-quality-assured ACTs and non-subsidized injectable artemether (ACTwatch Group et al. 2017; World Health Organization 2019b). Considering that caregivers in resource-limited settings are price-sensitive (ACTwatch Group et al. 2017), the comparatively high price for ACTs may explain why injectable antimalarials were not followed by the administration of an ACT, provided that ACTs were available and health workers in the private sector were sufficiently trained. Fourth, it may be worthwhile to consider regulating the use of intramuscular antimalarials at PHC level and in the private sector. In Uganda, the use of injectable antimalarials is currently not recommended below Health Centre III level (Uganda Ministry of Health 2016b). However, findings of this study and anecdotal evidence suggest that the administration of intramuscular and potentially intravenous antimalarials was a common practice in PHCs and in private clinics. The use of intramuscular artesunate or artemether has previously been proposed in Ethiopia and Nigeria with ambiguous conclusions on the feasibility of the approach (Adesoro et al. 2016; Kefyalew et al. 2016). Both studies suggested that implementation research could evaluate whether such an approach is feasible and effective in treating children with moderately severe malaria at lower-level facilities. The findings of this study are limited by the reliability and completeness of caregiver-reported data. The proportion of children receiving an ACT from a CHW or RHF as reported by the caregivers exceeded the proportions reported by these providers. Apart from caregiver recall bias, it is possible 86Chapter 6. Treatment-seeking pathways of children with suspected severe malaria that some treatments were not recorded by CHWs or at RHFs. Agreement between caregiver reported ACT administration and ACT administration recorded at the RHF was higher if prescribed treatments were taken into account (Appendix 4: Table A.9). This finding suggests that ACT prescriptions were usually filled in. However, the risk of overestimating ACT administration remains. Conversely, children with missing data on ACT administration were considered as not having received an ACT, which may have led to an underestimation of the proportion of children receiving an ACT. 6.6 Conclusion One of the Sustainable Development Goals is to achieve universal health coverage including access to effective and affordable treatment. Attaining this target will become more realistic if health systems are built around the people they serve, rather than the other way around. Therefore, new policies and recommendations should rely on existing practices and infrastructures. In relation to improving access to effective treatment, policy makers should consider the local landscape of treatment-seeking pathways to target interventions where they are most needed and likely to have the highest impact. 6.7 Declarations Funding This study was funded by Unitaid.

Effectiveness of rectal artesunate as a pre-referral treatment for severe malaria 7.1 Abstract Background: To prevent child deaths from severe malaria, early parenteral treatment is essential. Yet, in remote rural areas, facilities offering parenteral antimalarials may be difficult to access. A randomised controlled trial found pre-referral rectal artesunate (RAS) to reduce death and disability in children who delay arriving at a referral facility. This study examined the effectiveness of pre- referral RAS treatment in established community-based health care systems. Methods An observational study accompanied the roll-out of RAS in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria and Uganda. Children <5 years presenting to a community-based health provider with a positive malaria test and signs of severe malaria were followed-up during admission and after 28 days to assess their health status and treatment history. The primary outcome was death; covariates of interest included RAS use, referral completion, and post-referral treatment. Findings: Post-roll-out, RAS was administered to 88% of patients in DRC, 52% in Nigeria, and 70% in Uganda. The overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 6.7% (135/2,011) in DRC, in Uganda; 865/6,286 patients were sick at follow-up. In all countries, the CFR was higher after RAS-roll-out (DRC 6.7 vs. 6.6%, Nigeria 16.1 vs. 4.2%, Uganda 0.7 vs. 0.3%). In DRC and Nigeria, children receiving RAS were more likely to die than those not receiving RAS (aOR=3.31, 95% CI 1.43-7.65 and aOR=2.42, 95% CI 1.25-4.70, respectively). In Uganda, RAS users were less likely to be dead or sick at follow-up (aOR=0.59, 95% CI 0.45-0.78). Post-referral parenteral antimalarials plus artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) was protective but ACTs were not consistently administered. Interpretation: RAS pre-referral treatment had no beneficial effect on child survival in three highly malaria endemic settings. RAS is unlikely to reduce malaria deaths unless health system shortfalls such as referral and post-referral treatment are addressed. 89Chapter 7. Effectiveness of rectal artesunate as a pre-referral treatment for severe malaria 7.2 Research in context Evidence before this study WHO malaria treatment guidelines recommend rectal artesunate (RAS) as pre-referral treatment for children <6 years with suspected severe malaria if parenteral pre-referral treatment options are not available. De Carvalho et al. (2021) reviewed the published literature and documented a single randomized controlled trial conducted between 2000 and 2006 in two African and one Asian country in which pre-referral RAS was compared to placebo in patients with signs of severe malaria. In the trial, pre-referral RAS reduced the risk of dying from severe malaria by 26% (risk ratio [RR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.59-0.93) in children below 6 years of age. In a post hoc sub-group analysis of children who delayed referral to a clinic by more than 6 hours, RAS reduced death and permanent disability by about 50% (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.32-0.77) while there was no reduction in mortality in early referrals (<6 hours). The WHO guidelines on pre-referral RAS are based largely on this trial, despite some criticism of the methodology. A search of PubMed (search terms: (\"artesunate\" AND (\"suppository\" OR \"rectal\")) AND (\"death\" OR \"mortality\" OR \"fatality\")) found only one additional publication not referenced by de Carvalho et al. that documented changes in malaria incidence and mortality following the provision of RAS to eight of 24 health facilities in Serenje District in Zambia (Green et al. 2019). RAS was implemented in combination with measures to strengthen referral and drug supply. The Zambia Health Information System reported a lower proportion of deaths among cases of confirmed severe malaria in the study facilities in the five months after the introduction of RAS compared to the year before. Yet at the same time, the proportion of malaria cases reported as severe increased substantially. No individual RAS user vs. non-user analysis could be conducted and the package of implemented interventions did not allow attributing the observed changes to a single intervention. There is no published study of the health impact of introducing pre-referral RAS at scale. Added value of this study This is the first study documenting the effectiveness of the large-scale introduction of pre-referral RAS in established community-based health care systems. The study was conducted in three distinct highly malaria-endemic settings of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, and Uganda, thus covering a range of priority implementation environments. Since RAS was implemented through existing health care delivery systems with only minimal supportive measures, this study allowed assessing the effect of the intervention under realistic large-scale implementation conditions. With an individual patient follow-up after 28 days, and contrary to the only identified randomized controlled 90Chapter 7. Effectiveness of rectal artesunate as a pre-referral treatment for severe malaria trial, our study found no beneficial effect of pre-referral RAS treatment on child survival in the study areas. At the same time, we identified multiple health system deficiencies that undermined the effectiveness of severe malaria case management. Our study provides a realistic measure of the effect of introducing pre-referral RAS at scale compared to previous studies conducted under more controlled conditions; The study findings are hence likely to be highly relevant for a revision of the respective WHO recommendation. Implications of all the available evidence The evidence suggests that the potential of pre-referral RAS to reduce severe malaria deaths in children may not be realized unless underlying health system shortfalls are addressed. Introducing RAS at scale is therefore unlikely to reduce malaria deaths in many high malaria-burden settings and may even be counter-productive unless supported by measures that strengthen the entire continuum of care. Treatment recommendations and RAS implementation plans at global and national levels should be revisited taking into consideration this new evidence. 91Chapter 7. Effectiveness of rectal artesunate as a pre-referral treatment for severe malaria 7.3 Introduction Of the estimated 400,000 annual malaria deaths, the majority occur in children <5 years of age living in Sub-Saharan Africa (World Health Organization 2020b). Progress towards further reducing malaria's death toll has stalled in recent years and new and complementary approaches are needed to make progress towards global and national malaria elimination targets (World Health Organization 2020b). Access to prompt treatment with parenteral artesunate followed by an oral artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) alongside the management of complications can save a child suffering from a life-threatening episode of severe malaria (World Health Organization 2015b). Usually, only secondary or tertiary health facilities have inpatient wards with the capacity to manage a child with severe malaria comprehensively. Primary health centres (PHC) are often neither equipped nor allowed to administer injections and community health workers (CHW) are only trained to administer oral treatment for uncomplicated malaria episodes and are not qualified to diagnose or treat severe malaria. Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) programmes instruct CHWs to identify children with danger signs of severe illness (including those indicative of severe malaria) and then immediately refer the child to the nearest health facility (Young et al. 2012). Children are therefore more likely to suffer from fatal or debilitating consequences of severe malaria in areas where the services of higher-level health facilities are difficult to access (Coetzer and Adeola 2020; Karra, Fink, and Canning 2017). At primary health care level, options to manage severe malaria are typically limited to pre-referral treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a single dose of intramuscular (IM) artesunate, or, if injections are not available and the patient is <6 years of age, a single rectal dose of artesunate, followed by immediate referral to a higher-level health facility (World Health Organization 2015b). Rectal artesunate (RAS) rapidly reduces the malaria parasite load (de Carvalho, Kreidenweiss, and Held 2021) and in a placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted in Bangladesh, Ghana and Tanzania, the use of pre-referral RAS was found to reduce case fatality of an episode of broadly defined severe malaria by 26% (risk ratio [RR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.59-0.93) in children below 6 years of age (Gomes et al. 2009; Okebe and Eisenhut 2014). In children who took more than 6 hours to reach a higher-level facility, RAS reduced death and permanent disability by about 50% (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.32-0.77) (Gomes et al. 2009). Evidence from a single randomized controlled trial is unlikely to reflect the real-world effect of rolling out RAS at scale (von Seidlein and Deen 2009) and offers limited operational guidance on the optimal 92Chapter 7. Effectiveness of rectal artesunate as a pre-referral treatment for severe malaria way of introducing RAS. The community-wide exposure-response relationship is complex and affected by the broader health system context (Obrist et al. 2007). Previously, the unavailability of a WHO prequalified product hampered the generation of real-world evidence of the effectiveness of RAS. With two RAS formulations obtaining prequalification since 2018 and an increasing number of malaria control programmes ordering RAS (CARAMAL Project 2018; World Health Organization 2021c), there was an urgent need to generate evidence of the impact of introducing pre-referral RAS in routine clinical practice. The potential of RAS to prevent malaria deaths in high-burden settings should be ascertained to establish the role of this intervention in the quest to reduce malaria mortality by 90% by 2030 (World Health Organization 2015a). Here, we report on principal findings of the Community Access to Rectal Artesunate for Malaria (CARAMAL) Project, an observational study accompanying the large-scale introduction of pre-referral quality-assured RAS in established community-based health care systems in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nigeria, and Uganda (Lengeler et al. see Appendix 1). 7.4 Methods 7.4.1 Study design This was an observational study accompanying the roll-out of pre-referral RAS through CHWs implementing iCCM, and PHCs. The research team conducted the investigations independently; the training of health care providers, behaviour change and communication (BCC) activities, and continuous supply of RAS was the responsibility of local health authorities and UNICEF. Data collection started 8-10 months before RAS roll-out and covered 15-17 months of the post-roll-out period. 7.4.2 Setting The study was conducted in three Health Zones (Ipamu, Kenge and Kingandu) in DRC, three Local Government Areas (Fufore, Mayo-Belwa and Song) of Adamawa State in Nigeria, and three districts (Kole, Kwania and Oyam) in Uganda. The total population of the study areas amounted to 2.5 million people including 476,000 (19%) children <5 years of age (Appendix 5: Table A.12). Curative health services were provided by CHWs implementing iCCM, PHCs, and referral health facilities. Further details of the study sites can be found elsewhere (Lengeler et al. see Appendix 1). 93Chapter 7. Effectiveness of rectal artesunate as a pre-referral treatment for severe malaria 7.4.3 Participants and procedures Children <5 years presenting to a CHW or PHC with a history of fever plus at least one general danger sign according to national iCCM guidelines (Appendix 5: Table A.12), were provisionally enrolled in the study. These enrolment criteria conform with iCCM criteria for administering RAS. A malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) was performed for study purposes. Health care providers reported each provisional enrolment to the local study coordinator, who included the patient in the study database and scheduled a follow-up visit 28 days after provisional enrolment. Reporting procedures were setting-specific but included in all sites regular pro-active contacts between the study team and enrolling CHWs and PHCs, during which patient characteristics and information on RAS administration were extracted from provider records. Day 28 visits were carried out at the patient's home by trained study staff. Home visits included structured interviews with the patient's caregiver to record the health status and retrospectively elicit the history of signs and symptoms, treatment seeking behaviour, and administration of antimalarials including RAS. Study participants who were sick during the home visits were referred to the nearest health facility for treatment. Interviews with caregivers of deceased children, which included details on the circumstances of death, were postponed for up to one month to respect the mourning period. A mRDT (CareStart or SD Bioline, brand as per routine practice) was performed and haemoglobin concentration was measured (HemoCue hand- held photometer) on capillary blood collected by a single finger or heel prick. Patients who were successfully referred from a CHW or PHC to the main referral health facilities in the study areas were monitored during their admission. All procedures and outcomes during admission were recorded in real-time by facility-based study staff. Data was collected on tablets using structured electronic forms in ODK Collect (https://opendatakit.org/). The secure ODK Aggregate server was hosted at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute. CHWs and PHCs were sensitized and trained about the study during dedicated workshops. All study staff members underwent extensive training on study purpose, informed consent administration, and field data collection procedures. 7.4.4 Outcomes Death within 28 days of provisional enrolment was the primary study outcome. A secondary outcome was caregiver-reported illness of the child on day 28 (including both acute episodes and ongoing illness). Malaria RDT-positivity and haemoglobin (Hb) concentration were complementary indicators 94Chapter 7. Effectiveness of rectal artesunate as a pre-referral treatment for severe malaria of morbidity on day 28. Exposures of interest included RAS use, completed referral to a referral health facility with inpatient ward (Appendix 5: Table A.12), treatment with a parenteral antimalarial, and treatment with an artemisinin-based combination therapy. 7.4.5 Statistics Assuming a pre-RAS case fatality rate (CFR) of 6% (historical CFR for et al. 2015), 8.5% AQUAMAT (Dondorp et al. 2010)) a minimum of 6032 cases of suspected severe malaria were required to detect a 30% reduction in CFR between a 6 months pre-RAS and 18 months post-RAS period with 80% power and = 0.05 (Fleiss, Levin, and Paik 2003). The analyses included enrolled patients with an acute fever or history of fever, at least one national iCCM general danger sign confirmed during the home visit interview (Appendix 5: Table A.12), and successful follow-up 28 days after preliminary enrolment. Deaths were considered up to 3 days after the official day 28. Outcomes were calculated for each country as overall proportions, for the pre-RAS and post-RAS periods, and for RAS-users and non-users. Proportions were compared by chi-square tests. Country- specific logistic regression models were developed to estimate the unadjusted and adjusted association of the outcomes 'dead' and 'dead or sick' with RAS use. The enrolling provider or a village proxy was included in all models as a random effect. The set of adjustments varied between countries depending on the country context and the number of events available to analyse. Information on RAS administration is based on consolidated health worker records and caregiver reports. Data analysis was performed in Stata/SE 15.1 and 16.1 (StataCorps). 7.4.6 Ethics The CARAMAL study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Review Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO ERC, No. ERC.0003008), the Ethics Committee of the University of Kinshasa School of Public Health (No. 012/2018), the Health Research Ethics Committee of the Adamawa State Ministry of Health (S/MoH/1131/I), the National Health Research Ethics Committee of Nigeria (NHREC/01/01/2007-05/05/2018), the Higher Degrees, Research and Ethics Committee of the Makerere University School of Public Health (No. 548), the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST, No. SS 4534), and the Scientific and Ethical Review Committee of CHAI (No. 112, 21 Nov 2017). The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03568344). Only 95Chapter 7. Effectiveness of rectal artesunate as a pre-referral treatment for severe malaria patients whose caregivers provided written informed consent during the first contact with the study team (at the referral facility or during home visit) were enrolled in the study. 7.4.7 Role of funding source The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 7.5 Results 7.5.1 Participants Between April 2018 and July 2020, 8,365 patients were provisionally enrolled by a CHW or PHC. Of these, 772 (9%) were not followed-up or did not provide informed consent, 365 (4%) had no record of a positive mRDT, and 942 (11%) did not fulfil all inclusion criteria. Hence, 6,286 patients with suspected severe malaria were included in this analysis, of whom 3,402 were treated with RAS (Appendix 5: Figure A.4 & Figure A.5). Patients in Nigeria were on average older and more frequently male than in the other countries. Age and sex distributions did not differ between RAS users and non-users, except in DRC, where RAS users were slightly older (Table 7.1). Danger signs reported at enrolment differed between the three countries and in some instances between RAS users and non- users.

Thereafter, RAS was administered, on average, to 88% of study patients in DRC, 52% in Nigeria, and 70% in Uganda. Coverage fluctuated strongly in Nigeria and uptake was slow in the first six months in Uganda (Figure 7.1). Treatment and referral patterns differed between the countries (Table 7.2). Study children in Nigeria were least likely to complete referral. Most children who completed referral did so within one day. In the referral facilities monitored by study nurses, post-referral treatment with parenteral antimalarials followed by an ACT was not universally practised. None of the study children in Nigeria received an ACT during their in-patient time. More details on referral completion and post-referral treatment in the study area are published elsewhere (Brunner et al. 2021; Signorell et al. manuscript in preparation).

Effectiveness of rectal artesunate as a pre-referral treatment for severe malaria 7.5.3 Health status at day 28 follow-up Death A total of 223 deaths were registered among the study patients (135 in DRC, 69 in Nigeria, 19 in Uganda). The overall CFR was 6.7% (135/2,011) in DRC, 11.7% (69/589) in Nigeria, and 0.5% (19/3,686) in Uganda (p <0.001) (Table 7.3). None of the deaths were from an accident or injury. Most deaths occurred in a health facility (DRC 73%, Nigeria 49%, Uganda 42%), on the way to a (referral) health facility (DRC 17%, Nigeria 10%, Uganda 26%), and at home (DRC 7%, Nigeria 35%, Uganda 32%). In DRC and Nigeria, deaths occurred over the entire follow-up period (Figure 7.2). Deaths occurred later in Nigeria (mean 6.3 days after provisional enrolment) than in DRC (4.2 days) and Uganda (2.4 days) (p = 0.03). While there was no significant change in CFR after the roll-out of RAS in DRC and Uganda (Table 7.3), an increase was observed in Nigeria among both CHW and PHC enrolments (RR = 3.5, 95% CI 1.2-10.3 and 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.3, respectively). Illness In addition, 865 patients were found to be sick on the day of follow-up, with a significant difference between the countries (p <0.001) (complementary data in Appendix 5: Figure A.7). Conversely, a comparable proportion of patients was healthy in DRC (81%), Nigeria (83%), and Uganda (84%) (p=0.54). Of 6,020 patients tested by mRDT at follow-up, 44.0% were positive in DRC, 50.2% in Nigeria, and 69.5% in Uganda (Table 7.3). Those reported sick were significantly more likely to be mRDT-positive than those who were healthy (p <0.001) (Figure 7.3). In the latter group, HRP2/pLDH combo tests more frequently detected only HRP2 than in sick patients in DRC and Uganda (p <0.001, Appendix 5: Figure A.7), suggesting persistent antigenaemia rather than an active infection. Hb concentration measured in 5,768 patients at follow-up found a lower mean Hb in Nigeria (9.9 g/dL) than in DRC and Uganda (both 10.3 g/dL, p <0.001). Sick children in DRC and Uganda were more likely to have severe anaemia (Hb <7 g/dL) than healthy children (both p <0.001) (Figure 7.3 and Appendix 5: Figure A.8). 7.5.4 Health impact of RAS In DRC, there was no evidence of an association of RAS use with CFR (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 0.81-1.93) (Table 7.4A). After adjusting for covariates including referral completion and post-referral treatment, however, RAS use appeared to have a negative effect on survival (aOR = 3.31, 95% CI 1.43-7.65).

More broadly, RAS use did not appear to reduce the likelihood of being dead or sick at follow-up (aOR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.58-1.31) (Table 7.4B). Patients in DRC who did not complete referral were less likely to be dead or sick at follow-up than those who completed referral within one day. In Nigeria, patients who received RAS were significantly more likely to die (OR = 2.95, 95% CI 1.78- 4.90) (Table 7.4A). The risk of dying was much higher among those enrolled at a PHC compared to a CHW (CFR = 18.5% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.001) (Appendix 5: Figure A.9). Adjusted for enrolling provider, referral completion and post-referral treatment, RAS use remained strongly associated with death (aOR = 2.42, 95% CI 1.25-4.70) while administration of a parenteral antimalarial was associated with survival (aOR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.03-0.93). With the same adjustments, there was weak evidence of an association between RAS use and being dead or sick at follow-up (aOR = 1.60, 95% CI 0.96-2.65) and of a negative effect of not completing referral (Table 7.4B). In Uganda, in the context of overall low case fatality, no direct association was found between RAS use and death (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.29-1.74) (Table 7.4A). However, patients who received RAS were less likely to be dead or sick at follow-up (aOR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.45-0.78) as were those who were treated with both a parenteral antimalarial and an ACT (aOR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.25-0.61). Patients in Uganda who did not complete referral were less likely to be dead or sick at follow-up than those who did so promptly (Table 7.4B). 103Chapter 7.

ACT = artemisinin-based combination therapy, AS = artesunate, QU = quinine, RAS = rectal artesunate 104Chapter 7. Effectiveness of rectal artesunate as a pre-referral treatment for severe malaria 7.6 Discussion The current recommendation to use RAS as pre-referral treatment where parenteral alternatives are unavailable is based on a single randomised controlled trial that provides little evidence of the effect of introducing RAS at scale (Gomes et al. 2009; 2014; von Seidlein and Deen 2009). Other studies were implemented as intervention packages including both RAS and a strong support to referral mechanisms (Green et al. 2019; Phiri et al. 2016; Warsame et al. 2016). The CARAMAL Project represents the first large-scale assessment of the health impact of introducing RAS in existing community-level health care systems accompanied by only minimal supportive interventions (Lengeler et al. see Appendix 1), reflecting the anticipated large-scale roll- out of RAS (CARAMAL Project 2018). Based on systematic 28 days patient follow-up, CARAMAL provides robust evidence of the health impact of this intervention in three distinct sub-Saharan African settings with a high burden of malaria, and of health system factors that may promote or hamper the effectiveness of RAS as part of paediatric severe malaria care. The beneficial effect of RAS pre-referral treatment on survival found in the trial by Gomes et al. (Gomes et al. 2009; Okebe and Eisenhut 2014) could not be replicated in the 'real-world' scenarios of the three study sites. On the contrary, in DRC and Nigeria, patients treated with RAS were more likely to die over the course of the follow-up period. The use of RAS was found to have a slight positive health effect in Uganda, driven primarily by a reduction in children reported sick at follow-up (aOR = 0.61). Patients who were sick at follow-up a positive mRDT or severe anaemia (Hb <7 g/dL) more often than those who were healthy. RAS users were less often mRDT-positive (all countries) or severely anaemic (DRC and Uganda) at follow-up. The increase in CFR associated with the roll-out and use of RAS is unlikely to be a direct result of RAS treatment which was previously shown to be safe and efficacious (Awad et al. 2003; Gomes et al. 2008). It is likely that there are confounding factors on the effect of RAS beyond what the analyses could be adjusted for given the complex interactions between disease severity, treatment- seeking behaviour, and care provided. Secular and seasonal trends in disease incidence and severity, as well as an effect of Covid-19 on health seeking and provision of care, may also have played a role. In Nigeria, CFR was highest in children enrolled at PHCs (Appendix 5: Figure A.9) and patients attending PHCs were found to be more severely ill than those attending a CHW (Lee et al. manuscript in preparation). In Uganda, a country-wide increase in malaria was reported in 2019, overlapping with the early RAS implementation phase (NMCP, personal communication). Anecdotal evidence suggests that health workers stocking only a small number of RAS doses may have administered RAS 105Chapter 7. Effectiveness of rectal artesunate as a pre-referral treatment for severe malaria preferentially to more severely sick children. The small number of deaths in Uganda did not allow accounting for such potential confounders in the CFR analysis. Due to the community-level enrolment strategy in all countries, an expert clinical assessment of patients (incl. diagnosis of co-morbidities that might impact the effectiveness of malaria treatment) was not available for this analysis. In the absence of comprehensive measures to strengthen the underlying health system implemented synergistically with the introduction of RAS, several factors along the continuum of care may have hampered the effectiveness of RAS. Between 32.5% and 45.8% of study patients did not complete referral to an appropriate health facility. In DRC and Nigeria, we found evidence of RAS use having an adverse effect on referral completion (Brunner et al. 2021). Non-completion of referral after pre- referral treatment with RAS has been reported from other studies (Strachan et al. 2018; Warsame et al. 2016), and may prevent patients from obtaining adequate post-referral treatment. Economic barriers and distance were frequently mentioned as reasons for not completing referral in this study (Lambiris et al. manuscript in preparation). The finding that patients who did not complete referral were less likely to die may be a result of less severely sick patients, or those recovering quickly after a dose of RAS, not being brought to a referral facility. Improved health has previously been reported as a reason for non-compliance with referral advice (Simba et al. 2010; Warsame et al. 2016). However, comprehensive antimalarial treatment after a dose of RAS is crucial as one dose of artesunate alone (or in combination with another only partly effective antimalarial) cannot fully clear an infection (Barnes et al. 2004; World Health Organization 2015b). This study found patients receiving post-referral treatment with a parenteral antimalarial plus ACT to be significantly less likely to die (or be sick at follow-up). Yet, many patients who successfully completed referral did not receive an ACT at the referral facility after parenteral antimalarial treatment (Signorell et al. manuscript in preparation). In Nigeria, parenteral treatment was common but none of the patients received an ACT at the Cottage Hospital. Whether ACT prescriptions provided at referral facilities were purchased and administered could not be verified in this study. Pre-referral treatment with RAS with or without subsequent parenteral artesunate, but without an oral ACT, constitutes artemisinin monotherapy treatment. This is a risk for both resistance development and positive selection of circulating artesmisinin-resistant parasites, the latter of which has been found in Uganda (Balikagala et al. 2021; Ndwiga et al. 2021). All patients included in this study had access to formal health care providers (enrolment criterion) and 42-73% of deaths occurred in a health facility, often several days after first contact with the formal health system (mean 2.4-6.3 days). In Nigeria, the CFR among patients enrolled at a PHC exceeded 106Chapter 7. Effectiveness of rectal artesunate as a pre-referral treatment for severe malaria 20% over several months (mean 18.6%, data not included) (Appendix 5: Figure A.9). Together, these findings reflect weak health care systems that are often unable to save the lives of severely sick children. In these challenging settings, pre-referral RAS did not appear to have a beneficial health effect despite the potential of this intervention demonstrated under different circumstances (Gomes et al. 2009). Introducing pre-referral RAS without ensuring an effective continuum of care (including high referral rates and high-quality post-referral treatment) is unlikely to decrease mortality in settings with a high malaria burden but a weak health system. Conversely, RAS is most likely to be beneficial in locations where initial access to health care may be hampered, but post-referral services are available and of good quality. This is supported by the finding of a moderately beneficial effect in Uganda, where baseline CFR was lowest, the number of CHW per person was highest, accessibility of formal health facilities was best (measured eg. in distance/time to facility), and out of pocket treatment costs were lowest (Lambiris et al. manuscript in preparation). Evidence from implementing a package of interventions including RAS in Zambia also supports this notion (Green et al. 2019). 7.7 Conclusion Curbing the remaining burden of malaria mortality remains a top public health priority in countries with a high malaria burden. While pre-referral RAS treatment may have a beneficial health effect for an individual patient who can follow the full continuum of care, this intervention is unlikely to reduce malaria mortality in a population unless underlying health system factors are addressed. The large- scale roll-out of pre-referral RAS must be accompanied by measures to ensure definitive treatment with at least parenteral artesunate and a full course of oral ACT. 7.8 Declarations Funding This study was funded by Unitaid.

The results of the CARAMAL project presented in this thesis showed that post-referral treatment seeking and case management varied substantially between the three project countries of Uganda, DRC, and Nigeria. The administration of rectal artesunate (RAS) may have increased the risk of children not being brought to a designated referral facility where comprehensive treatment can be provided. Irrespective of this, treatment-seeking pathways leading to appropriate post-referral treatment were found to be diverse. Meanwhile, RAS did not reduce the case fatality of children with suspected severe malaria, but decreased the chance of children being dead or sick at follow- up in Uganda. Post-referral treatment with antimalarials had a consistent positive effect on health outcomes. The effect of referral completion was less consistent due to the bi-directional relationship between illness severity and treatment seeking. In the following sections, I discuss the implications of these findings for future guidance on the implementation of RAS, and position treatment seeking and case management within the wider context of access to healthcare to gain a better understanding of the reasons underlying malaria mortality. The discussion continues with suggesting health system strengthening and demand-side interventions as possible solutions to improve treatment seeking, case management and health outcomes of children with suspected severe malaria. The subsequent section provides a global perspective on healthcare access, global health practice and research. Finally, the last section before the overall conclusion discusses the methodological approach of the CARAMAL project in the light of the findings of the scoping review presented in Chapter 4. 109Chapter 8. Discussion 8.1 Implications for the implementation of rectal artesunate RAS did not prove to be effective in preventing deaths in any project country due to underlying shortfalls in the respective health systems. Evidence from Uganda, the research setting with empirically the most functional health system, suggests that RAS could have an effect on severe malaria mortality if the limitations in access to health care are adequately addressed. This finding leads to a somewhat paradoxical conclusion: the intention to scale up RAS was to save lives in places where incidence and mortality of severe malaria are the highest and access to healthcare the lowest; yet, in such locations (Nigeria and DRC), RAS did not prove to be effective. In places with a low CFR and comparatively better access to healthcare (Uganda), RAS may have saved additional lives, but the cost-effectiveness of a large-scale implementation is uncertain in respect to the small number of children that would actually benefit from the intervention. Based on the results of the CARAMAL project, it remains questionable under which circumstances RAS can be rolled-out as scale and substantially improve severe malaria health outcomes. The problem at this stage is that RAS has already been procured and is currently being scaled up by many sub-Saharan African countries (Medicines for Malaria Venture 2021), which must be considered in future policy considerations. While RAS may not be recommended where it has not yet been implemented, future guidance needs to focus on mitigating the risk of potential negative consequences of RAS administration, which are a reduction in referral completion and the risk of artemisinin monotherapy, potentially leading to the selection of artemisinin-resistant parasites (Awor et al. manuscript in preparation). The challenge is to ensure that RAS is implemented with supportive interventions strengthening the entire continuum of care for severe malaria. Regarding treatment seeking and case management, supportive interventions may target referral recommendations, referral completion to an appropriate provider, and appropriate post-referral treatment. First, referral recommendations for children with danger signs of severe malaria need to ensure direct referral to a facility that can offer adequate post-referral treatment. As a consequence, community health workers (CHW) may not recommend one facility to all patients but adapt their recommendations to the condition of the child and the reason for referral. For example, in contrast to children with danger signs of severe malaria, children with persistent fever could be sent to a primary healthcare facility for differential diagnosis. However, whether more nuanced referral recommendations can be implemented without unintended consequences was not part of the investigations conducted within the CARAMAL project. But if feasible, a policy change of referral recommendations could contribute to more efficient treatment 110Chapter 8. Discussion seeking, reducing cost and time of both caregivers and healthcare providers. Secondly, referral completion needs to be closely monitored and, if deemed insufficient (irrespective of RAS administration), a subsidized emergency transport or social health insurance may support caregivers with taking their child to an appropriate post-referral provider. Third, quality of care needs to be strengthened irrespective of treatment-seeking pathways. Ultimately, treatment-seeking pathways remain the free choice of caregivers, even though limited by the boundaries of cultural norms, health beliefs, limited resources and availability of healthcare services. To effectively cure patients and to mitigate the risk of the emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance in sub-Sahara Africa, it is of very high importance that all children with a malaria diagnosis are treated with an ACT irrespective of where treatment is sought. Strategies to improve ACT administration may be adapted to the provider and their specific shortcomings. For example, health workers at referral health facilities (RHF) in Uganda and Nigeria often prescribed ACTs to children admitted with severe malaria instead of administering the drug during admission, which was only common in DRC (Signorell et al. manuscript in preparation). At this specific type of provider, increasing the administration of ACTs directly at the facility may be an effective strategy to improve malaria case management. Where RAS has been implemented, additional considerations may have the potential to improve its effectiveness. Considering that private providers in Nigeria and Uganda were important sources of initial treatment seeking (CARAMAL household surveys), an extension of the implementation of RAS to these providers may be considered (Awor et al. 2021). However, this recommendation requires thorough investigation prior to its implementation. Considering that quality of care and adherence to guidelines at private providers are often below standard (Bosman and Cunningham 2018), extending the implementation of RAS to the private sector may do more harm than good. To improve cost- effectiveness, RAS may only be distributed to CHWs who are outside of the vicinity of referral facilities. Additionally, more flexible quantification algorithms and supply mechanisms may improve the availability of RAS where it is really needed. Areas with seasonal malaria transmission and high temperatures may especially benefit from better quantification procedures. If storage temperature exceeds 30 \u00b0C, stocked RAS must be recalled after 4-6 months (WHO Prequalification Programme 2018). In the CARAMAL project, storage temperatures exceeding 30 \u00b0C were documented mainly in Nigeria (CARAMAL temperature tracker data). Yet, malaria is primarily transmitted during the six- month rainy season in Adamawa State. Focusing the distribution of RAS on the transmission period may improve the cost-effectiveness of the intervention because fewer unused doses need to be retrieved and discarded. If provided with more doses during the high transmission season, community-based 111Chapter 8. Discussion providers may experience fewer stock-outs during the period in which RAS has the potential to be most effective. 8.2 The underlying problem: access to healthcare Whether children with severe malaria can seek treatment from appropriate providers and receive appropriate treatment is ultimately determined by their access to healthcare. The ACCESS framework by Obrist et al. (Figure 8.1) presents access to healthcare as a result of the interplay between livelihood assets and vulnerability context on the population side, and health services and regulatory context on the institutional side of the health system (Obrist et al. 2007). Access to healthcare is therefore, by definition, context-specific. As access to healthcare determines health service utilization, quality of care and - as a consequence - health outcomes, differences in treatment seeking, case management and case fatality among different settings may be explained by context-specific configurations of the five dimensions of access: availability, accessibility, affordability, adequacy, and acceptability (Penchansky and Thomas 1981). FIGURE 8.1: The Health Access Livelihood Framework. Five dimensions of access influence the course of the health-seeking process: availability, accessibility, affordability, adequacy, and acceptability. Adapted from Obrist et al. (2007). 112Chapter 8. Discussion The idea that access to healthcare and its dimensions are context-specific is reflected by the design and the analytical framework of CARAMAL. The CARAMAL project was implemented in three countries to investigate how RAS could become an effective part of the severe malaria continuum of care in different contextual and programmatic settings. In turn, the individual steps along this analytical framework are largely driven by access (Figure 1.4). If project outcomes are assumed to vary by research setting, the same assumption can be made for the way drivers of treatment seeking and case management influence these project outcomes. Indeed, the project found substantial differences between study settings in CFR, referral completion and the proportion of children receiving an ACT. In the following two sections, I will provide country-specific descriptions of the main project results and link these findings to access dimensions, and the population and policy context in Uganda and Nigeria. Caveat Considering that I have never been to DRC and had limited interactions with Congolese colleagues, I refrain from providing country-specific interpretations beyond general interpretations already included in Chapter 5 and Chapter 7. Additionally, describing all dimensions of access and how they may have influenced case fatality, treatment seeking and case management would have required data collection beyond what was collected by the CARAMAL project, and/or contextual knowledge beyond conventional wisdom or the knowledge I acquired during the limited time of fieldwork. The following sections mainly focus on accessibility and affordability. Data on availability was collected within the framework of the CARAMAL Health Care Provider Surveys, which are not included in this thesis. Adequacy and acceptability would have required research with a more qualitative approach as they include aspects of caregiver and patient perceptions (Obrist et al. 2007). 8.2.1 Uganda The low CFR of 0.5% in Uganda suggests that access to healthcare was comparatively better than in DRC and Nigeria. However, the fact that some children were treated with only an ACT and did not receive an antimalarial injection, especially at RHFs (see Chapter 6), may indicate that not all children were very severely ill. Yet, the CFR was also low among children directly attending a RHF and being admitted with severe malaria (Appendix 1, Figure 8). This finding confirms that the overall CFR of severe malaria in the Uganda study districts was rather low, at least among children seeking care in the public health system. At this stage, it is important to note that results from the PSS are biased by the exclusion of children that do not seek care in the public health system. This selection bias may have led to an underestimation of the CFR in the CARAMAL study, as children 113Chapter 8. Discussion who do not seek care or seek care from an inappropriate provider could be more likely to have a fatal outcome, as shown elsewhere (Vaahtera et al. 2000). However, data from the World Malaria Report 2020 support the findings of the CARAMAL project: Uganda is the country with the third highest number of malaria cases, but only ranks eighth for malaria deaths (World Health Organization 2020b), suggesting that malaria case fatality in this country is comparatively low. Nigeria and the DRC, which rank first and second in terms of the number of malaria cases, also contribute the highest and second highest numbers of malaria deaths worldwide. The low CFR in Uganda could be a consequence of the relatively higher level of accessibility of health care providers in the study area. Among the project countries, Uganda had the highest coverage of community-based providers and comparatively good coverage of RHFs (Table 3.1). It was the country with the highest proportion of study participants living within 15 minutes of a RHF ( >50%). While Uganda did not have the highest referral completion proportion to designated referral facilities, it had the highest proportion of children seeking post-referral treatment from any kind of provider (Chapter 5); overall, 96% of the children sought post-referral treatment. This high figure contrasts with previous studies conducted in Uganda finding significantly lower proportions of children completing referral to the nearest health facility (15%, (Lal et al. 2018)) or any post- referral provider (67% (Siribi\u00b4 e et al. 2016) and 47% (Ajayi et al. 2016)). Meanwhile, results from investigations of post-referral treatment seeking (Chapter 5 and Chapter 6) suggest that private clinics fill gaps within the public health system. Referral completion decreased with increasing travel time to a RHF, and of the children not completing referral to the recommended facility, most went to a private clinic. However, geographical accessibility may not be the only dimension of access that explains why caregivers sometimes preferred non-public providers. Shortfalls of public facilities documented elsewhere include low perceived quality of care and discourteous treatment of clients (access dimension acceptability) (Chuma, Gilson, and Molyneux 2007; Give et al. 2019; Simba et al. 2010); absence of health workers and stock outs of drugs (availability) (Mpimbaza et al. 2019); and costs for transport, treatment or bribes (affordability) (Give et al. 2019; Mpimbaza et al. 2019; Simba et al. 2010). In the present studies, we did not investigate these additional dimensions of health access. Quality of care at post-referral providers measured as the proportion of children receiving an ACT was higher in Uganda compared to DRC and Nigeria, even though figures were not directly comparable (Chapter 7). Meanwhile, more than 20% of the children initially seeing a CHW did not receive an ACT by either the initial or any post-referral provider (Chapter 6). This number is low compared to a previous study conducted in four public health facilities in Uganda finding that 95% of the children 114Chapter 8. Discussion admitted with severe malaria were not prescribed an ACT (Ampadu et al. 2019). Studies on adherence to treatment guidelines for uncomplicated malaria found higher proportions of ACT administration to children with a positive malaria test (43-95%) (Bawate et al. 2016; Kaula, Kiconco, and Nu nez 2018; Sears et al. 2013). While the non-administration of ACTs raises the concern that children were not effectively cured from malaria, the finding is particularly worrying considering that the establishment of artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum parasites in Uganda is now factual (Balikagala et al. 2021; Awor et al. manuscript in preparation). Until new non-artemisinin-based combinations become available, an immediate and important challenge consists of preserving the efficacy of ACTs. Besides resistance monitoring to inform the selection of locally efficacious drug combinations, there is a need to promote the use of quality-assured treatments and the adherence to recommended treatment regimens (World Health Organization 2021a). In Chapter 6, we showed that children who did not go to a RHF were less likely to receive an ACT. Most of these children had been to private clinics. In an effort to improve quality of care in the private sector, the Ugandan Ministry of Health incorporated the private sector in the Uganda Malaria Reduction Strategic Plan 2014-2020 (Uganda Ministry of Health 2014). However, the mere inclusion of the private sector in the strategic plan does not guarantee translation into actual engagement. The plan itself acknowledges that the limited engagement of the private sector in malaria case management activities - including training and quality assurance - presents a barrier to improving diagnosis and treatment of malaria in the country. A unique characteristic of the Ugandan iCCM programme was the high number of CHWs per under- five population compared to Nigeria and DRC. Results from the CARAMAL household surveys (Awor et al. manuscript in preparation) and the high enrolment numbers from CHWs in the PSS indicated that CHWs were often the first provider for children with suspected severe malaria. While the high number of CHWs may lead to more patients attending a CHW rather than a health facility, there is evidence that the iCCM programme in Uganda actually increases the proportion of children seeking prompt care and receiving appropriate treatment (Mubiru et al. 2015). Nevertheless, placing and promoting the use of CHWs where formal healthcare is available essentially represents a shift of healthcare provision from trained and payed providers to largely untrained and unpaid providers. Shifting the burden of healthcare to communities deviates from the original intention of the equity- focused iCCM strategy, which was to provide access to health care for communities outside of the catchment area of health centres (Figure 1.3) (Young et al. 2012). Considering the limited funds available for health, CHW programmes may represent a cost-effective approach to extend health services to more people (Lubogo et al. 2021; Vaughan et al. 2015). However, to sustain CHW programmes in the long term, CHWs remuneration must be geared to appropriate measures of CHWs' 115Chapter 8. Discussion opportunity costs (Kasteng et al. 2016). In fact, voluntarism and lack of incentives are two of the main reasons for the high attrition of CHWs in Uganda (Awor et al. 2021; Uganda Ministry of Health 2015). To overcome the limitations of the CHW programme, the Ministry of Health of Uganda proposed the community health extension worker (CHEW) strategy as a replacement of CHWs (Awor et al. 2021; Uganda Ministry of Health 2016a). CHEWs are payed health workers with 12 months of training and responsible for one parish. As a replacement of the CHW programme, this strategy could lead to more targeted and sustainable provision of healthcare through community-based providers. However, due to\"tension and confusion amongst funders, implementers and the district leadership\" , the current plan is to implement the CHEW strategy as a complement of the CHW programme (Awor et al. 2021). 8.2.2 Nigeria The results of the CARAMAL project in Nigeria suggest significantly lower access to healthcare compared to Uganda and reflect the situation of a highly vulnerable population. In Nigeria, the CFR of children with suspected severe malaria was high (12%), particularly among children enrolled in primary health centres (PHC) (19%). Post-referral treatment seeking did not reach the high levels of Uganda and was particularly low among children enrolled by CHWs. The administration of an ACT to children who completed referral to a RHF was essentially non-existent. All these results are concerning, but can be partially traced back to local circumstances. It is likely that low accessibility of healthcare providers contributed to the high CFR in Nigeria. Compared to Uganda and DRC, Nigeria had the lowest coverage with RHFs (Table 3.1), which is also reflected by the lowest proportion of children completing referral (48%) and the highest proportion of children living more than 60 minutes away from a RHF (41%). While higher than in DRC, the number of community-based providers per under-five population was rather low. Low access to health care was also reflected by the results of the CARAMAL household surveys in Nigeria. According to the results of the survey conducted before the implementation of RAS, only 39% of the febrile children were brought to a health care provider. Shortly after RAS was rolled out, an existing Emergency Transport System (ETS) initially designed to support maternal health services was expanded to children under 5 years. The expansion of the ETS correlated with an increase in care seeking for febrile children as well as an increase in referral completion in the post-RAS project phase. However, post-referral treatment seeking among children enrolled by a CHW remained low, suggesting that the ETS did not reach into very remote locations. 116Chapter 8. Discussion Interestingly, the CFR also significantly increased after RAS was rolled out. Partly, this observation could be explained with a relative increase of enrolments from PHCs in the post-RAS period, in combination with the higher CFR in PHC enrolments. However, the change in the composition of the study sample is unlikely to completely explain the increase in CFR after the implementation of RAS. In Chapter 7, we hypothesized that a secular or seasonal trend in disease incidence and severity may have been responsible for the negative effect of RAS administration on health outcomes after adjusting for other factors. Remarkably, the CFR was particularly high in early 2020, during the dry season in Adamawa State when malaria transmission is typically low (Figure 8.2). In a sub-sample analysis, we found that children enrolled in the dry season were more likely to be PCR1negative (OR=2.52, 95% CI 1.75-3.63, p <0.001), and PCR negativity was associated with an increased odds of dying (OR=2.43, 95% CI 1.23-4.81, p=0.01) (Omoluabi et al. manuscript in preparation). These findings clearly suggest that one or more other non-malarial diseases must have contributed to the high CFR observed in Nigeria, highlighting the importance of differential diagnosis of severe febrile illnesses and surveillance to identify unusual seasonal patterns in disease incidence and mortality. FIGURE 8.2: Time trend in monthly inclusions and case fatality ratio (CFR) expressed as 3-month moving average, by type of enrolling provider in Nigeria. One disease that may have contributed to the observed increase of the CFR in early 2020 is Lassa fever. In Nigeria, the peak incidence of Lassa fever is usually observed in the first three months of the year, which coincides with the dry season (Akhmetzhanov, Asai, and Nishiura 2019). Lassa fever is often mistaken for other endemic diseases that present with fever, including malaria (Agbonlahor et al. 2021). Meanwhile, the case fatality of severe Lassa fever infections exceeds the case fatality of other severe febrile illnesses (Akhuemokhan et al. 2017; Dahmane et al. 2014). Timely initiation 1Dried blood spots for PCR analysis were collected within the frame of the artemisinin resistance monitoring component of the CARAMAL Project. For more information please refer to Appendix 1. 117Chapter 8. Discussion of treatment can substantially decrease the CFR of Lassa fever; however, the disease remains often undiagnosed or diagnosis is severely delayed due to a lack of diagnostic facilities in endemic countries (Agbonlahor et al. 2021; Dahmane et al. 2014). In 2020, four confirmed cases of Lassa fever were reported in Adamawa State, all of which were found in the central towns of the state where access to diagnostic facilities is better (Adamawa State Ministry of Health 2020). Considering the available evidence, a Lassa fever outbreak in the rural areas of Adamawa in early 2020 appears to be one possible explanation of the increased CFR in this time period. Similar to accessibility, affordability of health care most likely hampered overall access much more in Nigeria than in Uganda. Out-of-pocket health expenditures at public facilities in Nigeria are reportedly high (Aregbeshola 2016; Aregbeshola and Khan 2021). A lack of protection from the financial burden of health expenditures is particularly a problem in the Northeast of Nigeria with a highly impoverished population, following years of insecurity and stagnating economic development (Programme 2018). While in the long term catastrophic expenditures for health may lead to a downwards spiral of poverty and poor health (Grant 2005), in the short term, anticipated or actual costs for health care can prevent or delay care seeking (Chuma, Gilson, and Molyneux 2007; Getahun, Deribe, and Deribew 2010; Simba et al. 2009), or lead to an early interruption of treatment (Aziz et al. 2016). Lee et al. (manuscript in preparation) found evidence of delayed treatment seeking in Nigeria, and according to the results presented in Chapter 7, children who received an injectable antimalarial at a RHF did not complete treatment with an ACT. There was also anecdotal evidence that children who later died had been discharged from the RHF because their health condition had not improved and the caregivers had feared additional costs. The evidence presented in this thesis does not allow for clear conclusions about the reasons for delayed care seeking and interruption of treatment. However, with the support of previous evidence, it seems likely that real or anticipated costs may have contributed to poor case management and - as a potential consequence - poor health outcomes. 8.3 Addressing the root of the problem Access to healthcare drives treatment seeking and appropriate case management; yet, ensuring sustained access for all requires a strong health system. According to the WHO \"Framework for Action\" on health systems, a health system consists of six health system building blocks: service delivery, health workforce, health information, medical technologies, health financing, and leadership and governance (Figure 8.3) (World Health Organization 2007). Yet, a health system cannot exist without people driving the system in their roles as health workers, managers, and 118Chapter 8. Discussion policy-makers, and - most importantly - as the beneficiaries of the system (de Savigny and Adam 2009). However, the role of the population as co-producers of health through care seeking, adherence to recommended treatment regimens, and healthy or unhealthy behaviour or habits is often neglected (Frenk 2010). As a consequence, health interventions tend to focus on reducing supply barriers; however, demand-side barriers may be as important in deterring patients from obtaining healthcare (Ensor and Cooper 2004). FIGURE 8.3: The six building blocks of the health system. People play a central role in the health system as beneficiaries and actors driving the system. Adapted from de Savigny and Adam (2009). The following section discusses the relevance of a strong health system for the CARAMAL research context, and the problem of weak health systems by contrasting health system strengthening (HSS) with less sustainable solutions. The subsequent section emphasizes the importance of demand-side interventions as a way of holistically addressing the problem of barriers to accessing healthcare. 8.3.1 Health system strengthening According to the WHO, the goal of a health system is to improve \"health and health equity in ways that are responsive, financially fair, and make the best, or most efficient, use of available resources\" (World Health Organization 2007). A responsive and equitable health system is particularly relevant for the contexts in which the CARAMAL study was conducted. The target group of RAS are children 119Chapter 8. Discussion with a presumptive diagnosis of severe malaria in remote areas of malaria-endemic countries. An equitable health system enables these children to seek and receive treatment, and a responsive health system reacts adequately to changes in disease incidence, i.e. it ensures diagnosis and treatment for all patients, irrespective of their underlying health condition. To reach the unreached, and to improve health outcomes for malaria and beyond, addressing the problem of weak health systems is therefore inevitable. Underlying health system factors were also identified to be the root cause for the ineffectiveness of RAS in the context of weak health systems in DRC and Nigeria. The realization that the effectiveness of global health initiatives is limited by the fragility of health systems is not new (Marchal, Cavalli, and Kegels 2009). In 2006, Alaka Singh of the WHO proposed HSS as a \"first-order\" goal to set the ground for the Millennium Development Goal of better health for all after it became clear that the goal was unlikely to be achieved (Singh 2006). HSS has since become a buzzword in discussions on improving health in LMICs (Marchal, Cavalli, and Kegels 2009), which led to controversies around an appropriate definition of the term (Chee et al. 2013; Marchal, Cavalli, and Kegels 2009; Witter al. 2019). The WHO defines HSS as \"improving [the] six health system building blocks and managing their interactions in ways that achieve more equitable and sustained improvements across health services and health outcomes\" (World Health Organization 2007). The criticism has mainly come from the fact that global health actors labelled any activity that improved health services \"health system strengthening\", often ignoring the dimensions of equity, sustainability and interactions between health system building blocks (Chee et al. 2013). In fact, an analysis of the Technical Review Panel of the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria found that most of the funding (75%) meant for HSS was directed towards health system support (The Global Fund Technical Review Panel 2018). In contrast to HSS, health system support is defined by its focus on inputs and short-term results (Chee et al. 2013). While such approaches are not necessarily ineffective and may even provide the best solutions in emergency situations, their sustainability is questionable and an effect beyond what the intervention is aiming to achieve is unlikely. To become effective, HSS will require a clear definition of its objectives and a true commitment to sustainable improvements of health, independent of single-disease programmes (Chee et al. 2013; Marchal, Cavalli, and Kegels 2009). Important to note, the recommendations made in section 8.1 on strengthening the severe malaria continuum of care and improving the effectiveness of RAS are unlikely to contribute to a stronger health system due to their mostly technical nature and disease-specific focus (Marchal, Cavalli, and Kegels 2009). Bottom line is that RAS is not the quick fix it promised to be; yet, its implementation in contexts with weak health systems requires additional investments into the continuum of care 120Chapter 8. Discussion for severe malaria. If health budgets are not increased, vertical disease programs continue to divert funding from more equitable and sustainable solutions that strengthen the health system. In the current economic climate of austerity, a substantial increase of health budgets seems unlikely (Lincoln 2021). In fact, the government spending priority given to health in low-income countries decreased between 2000 and 2018, and external aid is stagnating at its 2013 level (World Health Organization 2020a). Meanwhile, out-of-pocket expenditures remained high at levels above 40% in low and lower- middle income countries. Every malaria death is unacceptable due to its preventable nature. A vertical malaria programme may be able to save many of these lives with little money. Injecting this money in the health system might not lead to the same immediate impact as the financial investment is diluted across the entire system and may unfold its effect over a long time period, making the evaluation of HSS comparatively difficult (Adam et al. 2012). Investing into vertical disease programmes is therefore more attractive for donors, and in the absence of sufficient government health expenditure potentially the only solution to maintain population health at an acceptable level. However, the question to what extent short-term improvements are justifiable at the expense of the greater good and vice versa remains. 8.3.2 Demand-side interventions RAS has the potential to improve health outcomes of children with severe malaria; yet, as a single intervention, it does not address the problem of inappropriate treatment seeking leading to poor case management and health outcomes. Instead, a lack of resources and the inability to mobilize household and community assets often prevent caregivers from initiating treatment seeking or choosing appropriate providers (Obrist et al. 2007). Research and interventions with a focus on improving health services and utilization rates often limit interventions on the demand side to information, education, and communication campaigns (Obrist et al. 2007). Focusing on the supply side subjects people to a passive - or at best reactive - role in the health system. Acting on the demand side empowers people to play an active role in the system and recognizes that they are their own problems' experts. Yet, just as supply-side interventions, demand-side interventions can be a quick fix or a more sustainable solution. Demand-side interventions range from interventions that improve the immediate access to healthcare in the case of illness, such as subsidized transport, to interventions with effects beyond health, for example microcredits (Ensor and Cooper 2004). Evidently, interventions with a broad impact are more likely to improve access to healthcare in the long-term. 121Chapter 8. Discussion 8.4 Part of the problem: global inequity In light of the proposed solutions, the CARAMAL project serves as yet another example of the need to step back and take stock of our current approach to solving global public health problems. A primary reason for this is the programme's dependency on structures that are arguably (i) inequitable, and (ii) do not inherently strengthen the health system in the long-term. The implementation of RAS as a pre-referral treatment for children with suspected severe malaria in remote areas of malaria-endemic countries largely relied on the engagement of voluntary CHWs. It is imperative that we recognize that these CHW programmes recruit from the same population stratum that is most affected by the problem it is supposed to help solving. In the same way that these populations are neglected in access to health care, CHWs often receive little support to serve their community (Sunguya et al. 2017). Health interventions that aim at improving access for marginalized populations should not be a burden to these people. Instead, they should be transformed into an opportunity to escape the cycle of poverty and poor health. Meanwhile, inequity in access to healthcare is not a problem limited to populations in remote villages in sub-Saharan Africa. Difficulties in accessing health care - and subsequent poor health - is a general characteristic of marginalized populations irrespective of a country's income level (World Health Organization 2010b). As income inequality is growing in both developed and developing countries (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs 2020), population groups in low socioeconomic strata may struggle increasingly to afford quality health care (World Health Organization 2021f). Additionally, the global shortage of health workers has led to underserved populations in remote and rural areas all over the world (World Health Organization 2010b). Considering the growing inequity worldwide, it may not be surprising that CHW programmes have not only been implemented in LMICs but also in high-income countries such as the United States and Australia (Javanparast et al. 2018; Perry, Zulliger, and Rogers 2014). Under current global health practice, solutions to pressing problems like high malaria mortality are often designed, implemented and researched using a top-down approach, raising concerns about their relevance for local contexts. The fact remains that while there is inequality within populations worldwide, poor health is still disproportionally a problem of LMICs (World Health Organization 2021f). The inequality between developed and developing countries is not limited to health, and must be seen within the context of persisting political and economic domination of the Global North over the Global South since the end of our most recent colonial periods (Lincoln 2021). National security interests of donor countries, their commercial and trade interests and colonial 122Chapter 8. Discussion history continue to dominate bilateral aid to recipient countries (Addison, Ni no-Zaraz\u00b4 ua, and Tarp 2015). Additionally, large global health donors and regulatory agencies like the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria or the WHO are mainly based in the Global North. Yet, these decision-makers lack contextual knowledge to understand and solve the struggles of everyday realities in poor countries (Abimbola 2016; Anderson et al. 2009). The relevance of the problems identified and the solutions proposed by global health actors from the North is therefore at least questionable. Taking the example of CARAMAL, we do not know whether access to pre-referral treatment is a priority for caregivers of young children, or if pre-referral treatment is indeed a locally relevant solution for the problem of malaria mortality. The same problems of dominance and relevance pertain to global health research. The data needed to address global health challenges is often collected in the Global South, but guarded and analysed by research institutions from the Global North (Bump and Aniebo 2021). Yet, the information problem in global health is not only a problem of data ownership and access. Fundamental to the decolonisation of global health is also the question of which type of knowledge is valued. Significant weight is given to knowledge in the form of quantitative data, exemplified by the promotion of surveillance to target malaria interventions (World Health Organization 2021a). Contextual knowledge such as the knowledge of the local language and culture continues to be undervalued and, as a consequence, reinforces the power of those already in control (B\u00a8 uy\u00a8 um et al. 2020; Health Policy Watch 2020). Yet, the use of contextual knowledge in research provides an opportunity to improve the solutions to global health challenges. A contextualized understanding of the problem can shape the research design, questions and analysis, leading to locally relevant solutions (Bump and Aniebo 2021; B\u00a8 uy\u00a8 um et al. 2020). Thus, decolonising global health may not only pave the way to an equitable future, but also a way to faster progress in the fight against malaria. 8.5 CARAMAL in context: a methodological discussion While understanding the implications of the CARAMAL project at global scale is important, a critical examination of its methodologies allows understanding the project's contributions to the scientific evidence at a smaller scale, namely severe febrile illness (SFI) in children in LMICs. In the following sections, I apply the findings of the scoping review in Chapter 4 to the CARAMAL project, and discuss the appropriateness of SFI definitions and treatment-seeking outcomes within the project, and more specifically in the publications included in this thesis. I show where the methodology could have been improved, provide suggestions for future analyses to fill knowledge gaps within the project, 123Chapter 8. Discussion and position the CARAMAL project within the scientific literature on treatment seeking and SFI to show where the project contributes to addressing lacunas in related research. 8.5.1 Definitions of severe febrile illness Following the classifications emerging from the discussion of the scoping review, two SFI definitions used in Chapter 5 to Chapter 7 are normative (danger signs, death) and one is descriptive (perceived severity). The scoping review concluded that a normative understanding of illness should be applied if a health system perspective is more important than a thorough understanding of community perceptions and behaviour. Considering that the goal of the CARAMAL project was to investigate the feasibility of integrating RAS into an existing health system structure, the health system perspective was justifiably more dominant than the user perspective. In the following paragraphs, the individual definitions are discussed in more detail. The first definition of SFI was fever and danger signs and originated from the iCCM/IMCI guidelines. SFI definitions emerging from guidelines are normative if the guideline specifies the treatment-seeking actions recommended for the severe conditions, which the above mentioned guidelines do (World Health Organization 2018a). With this understanding, the CARAMAL project investigated community-level treatment seeking for fever and danger signs in three rounds of household surveys, and referral completion of children who went to a community-based provider. However, what was not entirely captured by this approach is the fact that caregivers may have their own understanding of danger signs, and so do community-based health workers who decide whether a child should be referred or not. We did not investigate to what extent the interpretation of danger signs by caregivers and community-based providers overlapped with the biomedical definition of iCCM danger signs. It may be argued that such an evaluation was not necessary because, as an operational research project, the focus of CARAMAL was the real-world application of guidelines rather than their optimal use under clinical trial conditions. Yet, the understanding of danger signs by caregivers and health workers can also be interpreted as an integral part of the continuum of care for severe malaria because it can influence the recognition of severe illness and subsequent treatment-seeking actions (Dillip et al. 2009) (Figure 1.4). If children who are wrongly recognized as being severely ill receive RAS, yet they are not at the risk of dying, the effectiveness of RAS as it was measured in Chapter 7 necessarily decreases. In fact, the low CFR in Uganda suggests that some children enrolled into the study may not have been very severely ill. The enrolment of mildly or moderately severely ill children seems less likely in DRC and Nigeria with substantially higher CFRs. To understand how illness recognition could have influenced the community effectiveness of 124Chapter 8. Discussion RAS, the research component of CARAMAL should have comprised a qualitative study investigating the meaning and understanding of danger signs among caregivers and community-based health workers. The second definition was death. According to the scoping review, death is a normative SFI definition if the analysis of determinants of death follow a normative understanding of right and wrong actions. Chapter 7 constitutes a good example of an analysis that investigates the appropriateness of care seeking and treatment leading to adverse health outcomes. This normative approach to analysing reasons for a fatal health outcome was justifiable in the sense that, as stated by the scoping review, understanding the circumstances that lead to severe illness becomes more important with increasing severity of the health outcome, of which death is the most severe. Yet, understanding death as the absolute endpoint ignores the two-way relationship between illness severity and care seeking. Death may be the consequence of poor care seeking and treatment. However, death also interrupts intended treatment-seeking pathways. Depending on the speed of illness progression and the barriers that need to be removed before initiating treatment seeking, a child may die before intentions can be translated into action. As a consequence, the chance of finding a significant association between not seeking treatment (or in the specific case of CARAMAL, not completing referral) and death increases. Yet, this association was only found in Nigeria (Chapter 7). For a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that lead to a child's death, care seeking intentions and barriers to accessing healthcare would need to be evaluated, alongside the actually observed behaviour. However, a retrospective investigation of treatment-seeking intentions may be difficult due to recall bias. In some of our analyses, we tried to account for the caregivers' perspective on illness severity by including a determinant of perceived severity. However, we did not explore the meaning of perceived severity as the scoping review recommends. This may be the reason why, as in previous studies, the association between perceived severity and referral completion was not consistent. An additional complication in this analysis is the retrospective evaluation of perceived severity one month after the illness episode. It is likely that, at this point, the perception of the caregiver had been influenced by experiences with health workers throughout the treatment-seeking process and by the final health outcome of the child. Additionally, some of the respondents to the follow-up interview were not the person that took the child to the healthcare provider, i.e. the reported perception of illness severity in these cases is likely inaccurate. 125Chapter 8. Discussion 8.5.2 Treatment-seeking outcomes In Chapter 5 and 7, a normative understanding of treatment seeking was applied, meaning that treatment-seeking indicators were dichotomized into right and wrong actions. Timely referral completion to a designated RHF was understood as more favourable than delaying or not completing referral. This simplification of post-referral treatment seeking was justifiable for two reasons. First, both chapters applied a health system perspective. From this point of view, children with severe malaria should be brought to a designated RHF because the system is supposed to ensure that appropriate treatment is available in these facilities. Secondly, the simplification of treatment seeking allows for the detection of statistically significant associations between treatment seeking and illness severity. The challenge is to fragment treatment seeking into meaningful categories that can be analysed. The construction of a meaningful treatment-seeking indicator can be guided by evidence applying a non-normative understanding of treatment seeking. Such a descriptive approach was taken in Chapter 6, which is exploratory and does not make assumptions about the appropriateness of any provider. Its analyses took into account that appropriate treatment may not always come from the recommended provider. However, it concluded that children who went to the recommended provider, that is a designated RHF, had the highest chance of receiving appropriate malaria treatment. With this conclusion, it supports the selection of the referral completion indicator in Chapter 5 and 7. However, this supportive evidence is only available for Uganda. As stated in the scoping review, descriptive studies are crucial for adapting interventions to the local setting. Therefore, it would be important to expand these descriptive analyses to the CARAMAL project in DRC and Nigeria. 8.5.3 Research gaps The main research gaps identified in the scoping review were the lack of treatment-seeking studies including both dead and alive children, and the small number of treatment-seeking studies on severe illness compared to the number of studies on mild illness. The CARAMAL project contributes to addressing both research gaps. Chapter 7 investigates problematic post-referral treatment-seeking practices and their association with a fatal health outcome. Chapter 5 and 6 contribute to the understanding of treatment seeking for SFI in children. More evidence of the CARAMAL project on treatment seeking and SFI is provided by the CARAMAL household surveys. However, to date, only the household survey results from Uganda have been published in the scientific literature (Awor et al. manuscript in preparation). 126Chapter 8. Discussion 8.6 Conclusion The fact that more than 400,000 people, mostly small children, still perish from malaria every year despite 20 years of investment is daunting, and a quick-fix solution is tempting. However, the historical and present efforts against malaria demonstrate that major progress in the future is only realistic if built on the solid ground of strong health systems and through strategies beyond technical solutions. Even though this conclusion is not new, the problem of weak health systems in malaria-endemic countries has not been adequately addressed in the past. Funding allocated to health system strengthening largely goes into interventions supporting single functions of the health system, which is less sustainable and has less broad impact. Additionally, funding for health systems strengthening competes with investments into quick-fix solutions, from which outputs and effects are more direct and easily measurable. Thus, the aim of preventing malaria cases and deaths in the short-term contradicts the long-term goal of building stronger health systems, unless health budgets are increased. In addition, the active role of the population as a co-producer of health is often ignored in research and policymaking, subjecting people to passive recipients of health services. To effectively improve access to healthcare, equal attention has to be given to demand-side and supply-side determinants of access. 127Chapter 8. Discussion 128Bibliography Abimbola, S. (2016).

This article is available on medRxiv doi: 10.1101/2021.12.10.21266567 ii Abstract The key to reducing malaria deaths in highly endemic areas is prompt access to quality case management . Given tha t many severe cases occur at peripheral level, rectal artesunate (RAS) in the form of suppositories was developed in the 1990s . RAS allow s the rapid initiation of life-saving antimalarial treatment , before referral to a health facility with full case management capabili ties. One rando mized controlled trial published in 2009 showed a protective effect of RAS pre -referral treatment against overall mortality of 26%, but with significant differences according to study sites and length of referral. Two important issues remain ed unaddressed to -date: (1) whether the mortality impact of RAS observed under controlled trial conditions could be replicated under real -world circumstances ; and (2) clear operational guidance for the wide -scale implementation of RAS , including essential health system determinants for optimal impact . From 2018 to 2020 , the Community Access to Rectal Artesunate for Malaria (CARAMAL) project was conducted as a large -scale observational implementation study in Nigeria, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). CARAMAL aimed to provide high -quality field evidence on the two issues ab ove, in three remote setting s with high malaria endemicity. In order to achieve this , a number of complementary study components were implemented. The core of the CARAMAL study was the Patient Surveillance System (PSS) , which allowed to track cases of severe febrile illness from first contact at the periphery to a ref erral health facility, and then on to a Day 28 visit at the home of the patient. Community and provider cross - sectional surveys complemented the PSS. Here we describe in some detail RAS implementation, as well as the key CARAMAL study components and basic implementation experience. This manuscript provide s an extensive reference document for the companion papers describing the impact, referral process, post -referral treatment and cost -effectiveness of the RAS intervention . APPENDICES iii Introduction Malaria globally Malaria is one of the leading causes of illness, death, and lost economic productivity globally. Malaria case incidence per 1,000 population at risk decreased from 80 in 2000 to 57 in 2019 , but annual reductions have significantly plateau ed since 2015 [1]. Over the same period, m alaria deaths decreased from 736, 000 to 409,000 and th is number has also stagnated since 2015 . The heaviest malaria burden still affects sub-Saharan African countries that accounted for an estim ated 90% of malaria cases and 92% of malaria deaths in 2019 . Children under 5 years of age represented 84% of malaria deaths in 2000 and 67% in 2019 [1], and the risk of malaria is disproportionate ly high among hard -to-reach populations [2]. Severe malaria Mortality from malaria is due to uncomplicated disease from a Plasmodium infection left untreated and progressing to severe disease and ultimately death [3, 4] . Mortality from untreated severe malaria is very high, and varies according to epidemiological , biological and clinical severity factors [5-7]. Our best estimate of case fatality rat ios (CFR) for African children with confirmed severe malaria disease and optimal treatment come s from the multi -centre AQUAMAT study [8]. Under parenteral artesunate treatment, CFR among 230 patients was 8.5% at 28 days following admission. On the other hand, CFR under routine treatment situations varies widely below or above this value because of varying quality of care , more or less stringent severe malaria case definitions , and lack of reliable cause -of-death estimates [6]. Effective clinical management of severe malaria patients has a high potential for reducing case fatality from malaria, with an e stimated protective efficacy for routinely admitted children ranging from 76 -87% [5]. In addition, effective treatment can prevent sequelae including developmental impairment [9], the recrudescence of infections , and ultimately also the emergence and spread of resistant parasites [10]. Reducing child mortality from malaria is arguably the first priority of any malaria control programme in highly endemic areas . To document possible reductions, n ational -level all-cause under -five mortality estimate s are widely available t hanks to Demographic and Health Surveys ( DHS ) and Malaria Indicator Surveys ( MIS) carried out every few years . However, the causes of death, where and when these thousands of deaths occur, as well as the underlying social, economic and health system circum stances are not well documented . Few representative studies have investigated these on a large scale , as for example de Savigny et al . [11] and Gomes et al . [12]. Uncertainties remain with regard to the community rates of severe disease and the frequency of the different clinical presentation s in different epidemiological settings [6]. In addition, access to and quality of care varies greatly between settings, with potentially significant impact on health outcomes [13]. Death from severe malaria often occurs within hours of signs of severity appearing . It is thus essential that therapeutic concentrations of a highly effective antimalarial drug be ach ieved as soon as possible , and a full APPENDICES iv treatment according to WHO guidelines be completed [10]. Synthetic derivat ives of artemisinins are safe and fast acting , and ideally suited for treat ing severe malaria parenterally [8, 14, 15] . While the management of severe malaria cases is usually within the stated capabilities of all higher -level health facilities, in practice many practical issue s such as chronic stock -outs, insufficient infrastructure and equipment , and inadequate human resources prevent the provision of quality care [13]. Access , in a broad sense, has been ide ntified as a key obstacle to malaria treatment and care [16]. The current stagnation in the number of deaths from malaria has a various causes, but undoubtedly lack of access to timely high -quality malaria case management is a major one. Rectal artesunate (RAS) As early as 1995 [17] it was shown that a single dose of artesunate, given rectally to adolescent s and adults over 15 year s, can achieve para siticidal blood concentrations within 10 -20 min, and can halve parasit e density within 6 -12 h [18-21]. Artesunate suppositories are easy to administer, safe, well accepted and allow rapid initiation of effective malaria treatment in remote locations [21]. However, one pre -referral dose of artesunate is no where near a complete treatment for severe malaria, and it is imperative that the full recommended curative treatment [10] follow s the initial rectal artesunate (RAS) administration . The full recommended treatment sequence for severe malaria consist s of intravenous or intramuscular artesunate for at least 24 h ours, continuing until the patient can tolerate oral medication . Each patient should then receive a full course of artemisinin -based combination therapy (ACT) over 3 days [10]. The latter is particularly important to ensure full parasite clearance and to avoid artesunate monotherapy. Following the first stud ies on artemisinin suppositories in 1995 -1996 , the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases ( TDR) recognized in 1996 the need for a non-oral pre -referral treatment for severe malaria . In two clinical trials in 1996/1997 , 50 mg and 200 mg capsules provided by Mepha Pharma of Switzerland were assessed [19]. These studies showed that the available doses were suboptimal for administ ration to children younger than 6 years , and a 100 mg dosage was suggested as an alternative (https://www.severemalaria.org/resources/rectal -artesunate -landscaping -assessment -report, accessed 15 November 2021) . None of these earlier formulations were ever approved by regulatory authorities . Despite these shortcoming s, the 50 mg and 200 mg capsules were added to the WHO Essential Medicine List in 2007 [21] and procured by countries, donors and non-governmental organisation ( NGO s) until 2014 , when a multi - donor -agency taskforce restricted donors from sourcing any anti -malarial products that were not approved by a stringent regulatory authority . Following a concerted action led by the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) product de velopment partnership , two RAS products ( made by Cipla Ltd. and Strides Pharma Science Ltd.) became WHO -prequalified in 2018 . Subsequently, t hey were registered in a large number of endemic countries and became widely available. In the same year, in preparation for large -scale deployment of RAS, the WHO issued revised guidance for RAS use as pre-referral treatment [22]. APPENDICES v Unfortunately , local policies and practical guidance on the implementation of RAS are often not fully aligned with the WHO recommendation . A 2018 review of the national malaria treatment guidelines of all 56 African countries undertaken as part of the CARAMAL project found that just over half of the countries surveyed ( n = 29) ha d included RAS in their national malaria treatment guidelines (https://www.severemalaria.org /resources/rectal ). Only 13 of these 29 countries ha d recommendations aligned with the WHO recommendation of treat ing only children under the age of six years with RAS, with five of these 13 countries recommending RAS for age five and below. The remaining 16 countries include d the use of RAS in adults (or cited unclear age limitations), which is not recommended by WHO at present [22]. Public health impact of RAS To-date , 14 randomized controlled clinical trials have document ed the safety, tolerability, efficacy and the pharmacological cha racteristics of RAS [21]. But only one large -scale Phase 3 field trial conduc ted in 2000 - 2009 assessed the public health impact of introducing RAS as pre -referral treatment in two African settings (Ghana and Tanzania , children between 6 -72 months ) and in Bangladesh (all ages) [12]. 17,826 patients suspected to suffer from malaria and unable to take oral medication were randomized to either RAS pre- referral treatment or to placebo , of which 12,068 were included in the final analysis . Suppositories were administered by local village residents with little medical training. After the administration of RA S, patient s were referred to the nearest health facility offering parenteral treatment . In this study, 87% of patients in the Africa n sites successfully arrived at the referral health facility , a very high percentage facilitated in part by the fact that t ransport was provided in some cases . That trial showed an overal l protective effect against mortality of 26%, but with a high site-related heterogeneity (Africa versus Asia) , and differences related to the length of time taken to reach a referral clinic . A significant protective effect was not seen for African children reporting to a referral clinic with in less than 6 hours : 2.6% death/disability in the artesunate group, 3.3% in the placebo group (21.2% protective efficacy, not statistically significant at the 5% level) . However, a statistically significant protective effect was seen for children alive after 6 hours , but not yet at a referral facility: 2.0% death/disability in the artesunate group, 3.9% in the placebo group, 48.7 % protective efficacy, p<0.0 5. Unexpectedly , the study found increased mortality in older children and adults in Bangladesh, which was considered to be a chance finding in a 2014 Cochrane review [23]. In an accompanying commentary to [12], von Seidlein [24] asked the question of whether these results, obtained in the frame of a randomized clinical trial, were replicable in real-life settings . Given the importance of reducing deaths from malaria in highly malaria -endemic areas , and given our current lack of understanding of rates and determinants of fatal malaria disease, this question need ed urgently to be ad dressed . The question re -surfaced at the time of the development of the new formulations of RAS around 201 6, and triggered the launching of the \"Community Access to Rectal Artesunate for Malaria (CARAMAL) \" project in 2017. APPENDICES vi The CARAMAL project The CARAMAL project , funded by UNITAID, was designed to support the market introduction of the two WHO quality -assured RAS products from Cipla Ltd. and Strides Pharma Science Ltd. CARAMAL aimed primarily at advancing the development of operational guidance for the implementation and scale -up of RAS . To do this, it relied on tw o essential and independent components: Firstly, RAS implementation in the frame of established integrated Community Case M anagement (iCCM) programme s, or in the frame of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI ) in low -level primary health facilities. Secondly , a large operational research component accompanying the implementation of RAS . The research component of the CARAMAL project tested the hypothesis that it is feasible to achieve reductions in severe malaria case fatality rat ios by delivering RAS through established routine health system platforms , without substantial supportive interventions , and without unintended negative consequences. Here we present a general description of the CARAMAL project , its rese arch questions, detailed methodology and overall operational results. The key findings and recommendations from the scientific investigations of the CARAMAL project are presented elsewhere, with a focus on the health impact of the large -scale roll -out of RAS [25], referral processes and completion rates [26], the quality of treatment at referral health facilities [Signorell et al. manuscript in preparation ], and cost -effectiveness [Lambiris et al . submitted ]. Give n its size (over 14,000 episodes of severe fever observed ), its abi lity to follow these children for 28 days after enrolment into the study , and the multiplicity of research tools, CARAMAL offer ed unique insight into the fate of children experiencing severe febrile illness es (including severe malaria ) in remote locations in Africa . The study also illuminate d the many health system characteristics that led either to successful or to sub - standard antimalarial treatment effectiveness , ultimately determining child survival . Materials and Methods Project setup The CARAMAL project was organized as a large multi -country consortium . The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) provided overall management . The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) , together with national and local health authorities, were respons ible for introducing and distributing quality -assured RAS at primary health care level through health care providers that lack the capacity to administer parenteral treatment. This included community health workers in iCCM programs , as well as primary health care facilities . The operational research component was coordinated by the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute , and implemented in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) by the Kinshasa School of Public Health, Univers ity of Kinshasa; in Nigeria by Akena Associates Ltd.; and in Uganda by the School of Public Health of Makerere University. The Pasteur Institute in Cambodia was contracted to provide an assessment of molecular markers of artemisinin resistance in the study areas. Medicines for Malaria Venture ( MMV ) was responsible for making quality -controlled pre -qualified RAS available globally and in the three project APPENDICES vii countries. The WHO Global Malaria Program (WHO GMP) provided technical and scientific support on specifi c aspects of the project , and was responsible for turning the generated evidence into policy and implementation guidelines . Country and site selection The CARAMAL project was implemented in three sub-Saharan African countries , each with a high malaria burden. The three project countries (DRC, Nigeria, and Uganda ) together share about 42% of total global malaria cases (DRC 19 million cases, Nigeria 61 million cases , Uganda 8.5 million cases in 2019 ) and 39% of total reported malaria deaths (DRC 42,000 de aths, Nigeria 110,000, Uganda 12,000 in 2019 )[1]. The study areas included three Health Zones in the Provinces of Kwilu and Kwango in DRC , three Local Government Areas (LGA) in Adamawa State in Nigeria, and three district s (Oyam, Kwania & Kole) in the Northern Region of Uganda . In total, the study areas covered a population of approximately 2 .5 million , including 476,000 children under five years (Fig 1 and Supporting Information S 1 Fig ). The study sites in the three countries were selected based on the evaluation by UNICEF - and vetted by national authorities - of ongoing iCCM operations, case numbers, and security considerations. All implementation sites were considered remote based on distance to tertia ry health facilities , to reflect settings in which RAS could have the greatest potential based on previous findings [12]. To provide some degree of geographical, cultural, linguistic and health system diversity, one country was selected from West, Central and East Africa , respectively. Fig 1 also shows key climatic data, as well as malaria infection ra tes in children under five years of age, as measured in the frame of the CARAMAL study. The three sites were shown to ha ve a high level of endemicity: the community parasite rates in children under 5 years were 40 -57% in DRC, 38 -61% in Nigeria and 53 -78% i n Uganda ( Fig 1 ). APPENDICES viii Fig 1: Study areas and study populations in the three CARAMAL p roject countries . mRDT = malaria Rapid Diagnostic Tests. APPENDICES ix Health system environment Health services in the study sites consist ed of a network of formal health facilities, including primary health centres (PHC) that offer ed mainly preventive and curative outpatient services , and referral health facilities with higher -level medical capabilities and usually inpatient wards (Table 1 ). In all three countries , and following national guidelines, c omprehensive treatment for severe malaria patients was only meant to be provided in referral health facilities. Private for -profit clinics and pharmacies were present in each site in varying numbers. Unfortunately, we could not cover these fully in the frame of the CARAMAL work because this would have exceeded the available resources . But patient visits to these facilities were elicited in the various data collection instruments. RAS was implemented in all Primary Health Care (PHC) facilities. RAS was also implemented in each study site through Community Health Worker (CHW) programmes offer ing basic preventative and curative services , in line with global and national iCCM guidance . The CHWs implement ed iCCM algorithms , which could be leveraged in the frame of the CARAMAL project to implement RAS [27]. In this manuscript, community -based providers in all three countries are called \"CHW \", even though the re was a different terminology in each country . Their number s also differ ed significantly by country (Table 1 ). In all three countries, CHWs were unpaid volunteers or individuals receiv ing only a minimal financial incentive. The number of health care providers, the estimated under 5 population, and the ratio of under -fives to healthcare worker in the three CARAMAL project sites are all shown in Table 1 . Uganda had both the highest coverage of referral health facilit ies (RHFs ) and community -based providers (CHW and PHC). In DRC and Nigeria, CHWs are strategically located in locations where other formal public health providers are far away (i.e. considered hard -to-reach). In Uganda, the national policy is that two CHWs are located in every village, explaining their high coverage. Table 1 illustrates the significant differences in the health care structure between the three sites .

In the three countries, RAS pre-referral treatment is part of the countries' current national malaria treatment policy , though not yet implemented at scale . In the study areas, RAS was rolled out at community level in early 2019 through the two channels list above . In preparation for the roll -out of RAS , MMV developed job aids and training materials for the appropriate management of children experiencing symptoms of severe febrile illness/ suspected sever e malaria ( Fig 2). According to WHO /UNICEF iCCM guidelines [27], patients eligible for pre -referral RAS are defined as follow s: age below 5 years, fever or a history of recent fever, plus one of the following general danger signs : lethargy/unconsciousness, not able to feed or drink , convulsions, repeated vomiting. While local iCCM guidelines (e.g. in Nigeria) included a few additional danger signs, it was this broad clinical picture of severe febrile illness - especially the inability to tolerate oral medications, that promp ted the administration of RAS and the issuing of a referral notice to a higher level health facility . Of note is that (1) the iCCM definition of a severe febrile illness does not overlap entirely with the clinical definitions of severe malaria [10], and (2) the iCCM algorithm does not require a malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (m RDT) if severe malaria is suspected. These point s will be further elaborated in the result s section below. Patients attending primary health centres staffed with medical personnel were usually assessed based on the IMCI criteria , and administered RAS based on a severe malaria diagnosis. APPENDICES xi Fig 2: Teaching aids developed by Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) for the training of health workers in the correct adminis tration of RAS (source: https://www.mmv.org/access/tool -kits/artesunate -rectal - capsules -tool-kit). Training sessions on RAS administration were conducted for over 8,000 CHWs and staff of primary health facilities in 2019 - in some instances embedded in broader training /retraining of CHWs . A second round of trainings was conducted in mid -2020 for new staff and as a refresher for previously trained staff . These were also adapted to include content on infection prevention and control in the context of the C OVID -19 pandemic . Supportive health system interventions A limited number of essential supportive interventions were implemented in addition to introducing RAS, to facilitate rollout and foster appropriate higher -level care in the study sites . In DRC, additional injectable artesunate had to be distributed to referral facilities ( 27,000 vials in 2019) even though this was meant to have already been included in ongoing malaria control programmes . In Nigeria , a color -coded, two -way referral form was printe d to improve communication between CHWs and referral health facility staff ; and an existing emergency transport system for emergency obstetric care was extended to allow the transport of severely ill children . In Uganda , district -level ( parish ) coordinator s were engaged to support data collect ion from CHWs and support replenish ment of their RAS stock. These additional health system strengthening activities were limited to a few essential supplies and processes by design due to scalability considerations , APPENDICES xii and purposely did neither include large -scale supply chain management support nor fundamental improvement of referral services given the aim of evaluating the effect of introducing RAS under real -world circumstances . The issue of transport subsidies to facilitate referral completion was discussed within the team , with relevant national authorities and the donor . For the same considerations as above it was deemed that additional health systems interventions such as transport subsidies or purchase of additi onal transport modalities (e.g. motorcycles) , while potentially life -saving, would be unsustainable in the long -run and thus outside the aim of generalizability of the CARAMAL project . A round of s upportive supervision was initiated shortly after RAS rollout in April 2019 by the relevant government authorities to ensure proper clinical care and effective utilization of supplies . While supportive supervision and review meetings are considered a key part of community -level primary health care (as they are used to train new CHWs and peripheral health facility staff , ensure quality of care, collect new supplies, return expired RAS, submit reports , etc .), regularity is often impeded by a number of factors including lack of financing, transport, climatic & se curity factors . Project implementation was concluded in October 2020 and activities were transitioned to national authorities in each project country by April 2021. Study design and conceptual framework Evidence generation around the roll -out of RAS was designed as an observational study with a before -and- after plausibility evaluation design [28]. Given (1) the massive sample size required (total population exceeding 2,200,000, including 400,000 children under five years - see calculations below) , (2) the enormous practical implementation difficulties due to the remote location of the study sites, and (3) ethical issues in running a control group for an established life -saving intervention already included in national treatment guidelines, this was de facto the only possible design. We are well aware that such a befo re-and-after design bears a high r isk of bias for the main outcome - impact on case -fatality - because many underlying contributing factors ( seasonal and climatic, health system functioning, economic, co-interventions for malaria prevention, disease outbreaks etc.) could have an uncontroll ed impact on the outcome measurements. To mitigate this problem, a s many of these factors as possible were measured through the different data collection tools (see section s below) , triangulated , and key co -variates were used in the multivariable analyses that are presented in forthcoming publications. The overall conceptual framework for evidence generation was the continuum of care for severe febrile illness : starting with the recognition of a child's illness at home , then care -seeking and case management outside the home, and end ing 28 days later with the determination of the health status of the child (Fig 3). This continuum was broken down into discrete 'steps' that could be measured as part of a real-world effectiveness study . APPENDICES xiii Fig 3: Continuum of care for an episode of severe febrile illness (central block) and key themes identified for analysis (numbered with yellow highlights) . 1. RAS implementation (coverage), 2 . Health impact of introducing pre -referral RAS, 3 . Severity of illness, 4 . Treatment seeking pathways, 5 . Treatment and referral at community -based providers, 6 . Case management at referral facilities, 7 . Cost and cost -effectiveness of introducing RAS . Study population The CARAMAL study components focus ed on c hildren <5 years of age (rather than < 6 years as in the WHO guidelines for pre -referral RAS use [2]), to be in line with the target age group of iCCM and IMCI guidelines [27]. The Patient Surveillance System (PSS) described below covered primarily children seeking care for a current episode of severe febrile illness starting at the level of a community -based health care provider. This included suspected severe febrile illness patients attending a CHW and identified based on iCCM general danger signs , as well as patients attending a PHC and identified as cases of severe malaria. In addition, children <5 years directly seeking care at a referral facility and admitted with a diagnosis of \"severe malaria\" were also enrolled . Even though these children were not e ligible for RAS pre -referral treatment, and thus not part of the primary analysis, they were included in the CARAMAL study to understand their comparative treatment seeking behavio ur, diagnosis, and case management at the referral facility. Including these patients also allowed for a comparison between case numbers and CFR at community -based providers versus referral facilities , and a more comprehensive calculation of severe febrile illness / severe malaria rates . APPENDICES xiv Data collection methods Data were collected through a set of complementary activities aligned with the roll -out of RAS in the study areas (Fig 4). RAS roll -out was gradually initiated from March -April 2019 onwards. Pre-RAS implementation baseline data was collected between April 2018 and March -April 2019, post -RAS implementation data between March -April 2019 and August 2020, with small local variations depending on the RAS roll -out progress . The core of the CARAMAL evidence generation was the PSS, described in detail below. Patients were en rolled in the PSS over the entire study period , both before and after the roll -out of RAS. Data on molecular markers of artemisinin drug resistance were collected in the frame of the PSS (see below) . In addition, o ne health care provider survey (HCPS) and one household survey (HHS) took place during the pre-RAS period, and two each in the post -RAS implementation period. In DRC , the last HCPS and HHS were only conducted in 2 out of the 3 sites. Data for the costing study were collected in 2020. Data collecti on activities are described in detail below; a comprehensive list of indicators related to each activity is provided in Supporting information S 2 Table . Fig 4: Schematic representation of the various CARAMAL survey instruments and the duration of data collection . Activity 1: Patient Surveillance System (PSS) Patients were tracked at three contact points during the health seeking pathway (Fig 5): (1) at the CHW or primary health care facilit ies, where patients were provisionally enrolled and assigned a unique study ID , (2) at the referral facilit ies, and (3) during a follow up visit at home 28 days after the first contact . Alternatively , for children found to be deceased by day 28 , an adapted interview was conducted about one month after their passing to respect the mourning period . APPENDICES xv At the CHW or primary health facilit ies, the children underwent standard clinical examination s, with treatment and referral procedures as per local iCCM or IMCI . For CARAMAL study purpose s, a rapid diagnostic test for malaria (mRDT) was also conducted at the primary point of contact for all eligible children. Fig 5: Schematic representation of possible points of contact in the P atient Surveillance System . ID = identification by unique study ID. Green triangles represent points of contact, red triangles absence of contact. CHW=Community Health Workers. HF=Health facility. No=Number. QA=Quality -assured. CARAMAL study nurse s were posted at major referral f acilities to document the triaging, registration procedures, diagnosis and treatment of patients admitted with severe malaria , either after referral from a community -based provider , or presenting directly to the referral facility . The study nurse s also recorded the patients' signs and symptoms, clinical progression, discharge outcome (recovery, death) alongside the approximate timing of all procedures. Data were captured in real -time , through observation or extracted from routine hospital records, as appropriate . All enrolled patients were reported to the study team and registered in the study database . On this basis, a follow -up home visit after 28 days was scheduled . At the day 28 home visit, a structured questionnaire was used to elicit information on the current health status of the child (cured, still ill, passed: primary outcome) and care seeking since the time of first contact , with a special focus on the referral process and antimalarial treatment . Perception of RAS and care seeking APPENDICES xvi costs were also elicited . An mRDT ( Hb) measurement Sweden) were performed using capillary blood . Due to the high prevalence of positive mRDTs at the day 28 follow -up visits early in the project, as well as evidence of prolonged Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein 2 ( HRP2 ) antigen aemia [29], a decision was taken in January 2019 to switch from an HRP2 -only test to an HRP2/pLDH lactate dehydrogenase ( pLDH ) is eliminated much more rapidly after successful treatment [29], allowing for a more accurate estimate of the number of patients with an active infection on day 28 . The day 28 visit and the monitoring of patients during their admission at referral facilities were the primary data sources for the monitoring and evaluation of patients . In addition, selected data points were collected directly from the enrolling community -based provider s, based on their routine records. This included crucially informa tion on RAS administration . Data was collected in ODK Collect (https://opendatakit.org/ ) on tablet computers . Sample size calculation for the PSS : Based on historical case -fatality reports for severe malaria (2.8% AQUAMAT [8]) a 6% CFR was assumed at baseline. The data collection time was 6 months pre -RAS (baseline) and 18 months post -RAS. The original plan to have one year baseline and tw o years post -RAS could not be realized after extensive delays due to the ethical approval process . The sample size calculation was based on the formulas by Fleiss 2003 [31] with an allocation ratio of 3, and computed in STATA using the 'power two proportions p1 p2, nratio' command. A minimum sample size estimation of 6,032 cases of severe malaria in children <5 years over 24 months was based on the detection of a 30% decrease in case fatality across the three project countries following the roll-out of RAS, with 80% power and = 0.05. Rounded up, this translated into 1,600 cases in the pre -RAS at baseline phase and 4,600 post -RAS r oll-out, across the three countries (total 6,200). We also assumed that only 40% of all severe malaria cases would be enrolled in to the PSS at CHW/primary health facility level and followed up on day 28. For measuring changes in CFR, a pooled analysis with data from the three countries was planned, while other less sample -size demanding indicators were calculated per country . In order to obtain this nu mber of severe malaria cases, a total population of 2.2 million individuals including at least 400,000 chil dren under 5 years needed to be considered. This target was exceeded (see Fig 1 ). Further calculations per country confirmed that this sample size was large enough that other conditions such as severe febrile illness, and improvements in referrals, could b e detected with at least the same probability (calculations not shown). Activity 2: Health Care Provider Surveys (HCPS) HCPS were conducted annually to assess the severe malaria case management capacity of the local health system. Two survey instruments were completed by each provider: (1) a structured checklist assessing the availability of essential medical supplies and equipment, human resource s, infrastructure and APPENDICES xvii documentation in their health facility , and (2) a questionnaire aimed at the providers themselves, and containing questions on demographics, education and training, work experience , supervision, training received, knowledge, attitudes and practices relevant to febrile case management (incl. diagnostic algorithm and RAS treatment guidelines), and implementation experience with these treatment guidelines. Both forms were designed for electronic data entry using ODK. All included health care providers sign ed an informed consent form before the interview . Sampling and sample size calculation for the HCPS : The HCPS included a stratified random sample of health care providers treating children < 5 years , including 40 community -based providers (CHW) and staff at primary and referral health facilities. In DRC and Uganda, th e survey included most non-referral higher health facilities in the study area, while in Nigeria , a random sample of 40 higher -level facilities was included. The following clinical/nursing staff involved in the treatment of children under five years with f ebrile illness were eligible for interviews: i) all selected CHW ; ii) at selected primary health care facilities: the officers in charge and all other clinical staff ; iii) at referral facilities: the officer -in-charge and all clinical staff in the out -patient and paediatric inpatient departments, among which two staff members per category were randomly selected for interview. The sample size was estimated to allow detecting a 19% decrease in the minimum acceptable coverage (defined as availability of RAS an d adherence to case management guidelines including referral), following the roll -out of RAS. From a baseline value of 80%, with a power of 80% and an error = 0.05. Activity 3: Household surveys (HHS) HHS were carried out annually to assess malaria cont rol intervention coverage, caretaker treatment seeking behaviour , caretakers' knowledge of and attitudes towards RAS, and to measure prevalence of malaria and anaemia in the population < 5 years of age (using the same procedure as during the Day 28 visit ). In each household, the household head and parents/care givers of children < 5 years of age were eligible to participate in face -to-face structured interviews , after informed consent . All forms were designed for electronic data entry using ODK. Sampling and sample size calculation for household surveys : Households were selected using a two -stage random sampling approach (village -household), whereas the sampling frames consisted of all villages in the study area and all households in the village with at least one child < 5 years. Treatment seeking from formal health facilities in case of fever in children <5 years was assumed to be between 15% [32] to over 75% [33]. For th e calculation of the sample size an increase in treatment -seeking from 15% (minimum scenario pre - implementation) to 20% post - implementation of RAS, with 80% power and = 0.05 was aimed for . A minimum of 906 household survey responses per country and surv ey round was required. APPENDICES xviii Activity 4: Economic evaluation Based on a combination of programmatic records and research data, this study component assessed the incremental economic costs of RAS introduction. In a second step, the incremental cost -effectiveness of RAS introduction over the current standard of care for the management of severe febrile illness / malaria was assessed . The methodology for this component is described in detail in a forthcoming publication (Lambiris et al. , submitted ). Of note, funding from the CARAMAL project was always additional to funding provided by government resources and support by other partners. Programmatic records of RAS implementation by UNICEF and its partners provided the backbone for the routine monitor ing of process indicators. These includ ed procurement records, supervision reports, routine reports and provider geo -locations , which were on occasion incomplete for a variety of factors . Effects of the COVID -19 Pandemic Due to the COVID -19 pandemic and th e resulting travel restrictions and government safety procedures, certain adaptations in data collection became necessary in 2020 . Some Day 28 interviews were conducted intermittently by phone when no visit s were possible. The last round of the Health Care Provider and Household Surveys was postponed beyond the planned period of data collection (September -October 2020 ) to December 2020 in DRC, when the areas were again fully accessible. Fortunately, the o verall effect of the pandemic on data collection was not too high , even though some temporary service disruptions were noted and in all three countries . Monitoring of Artemisinin resistance While resistance of the Plasmodium parasites against artemisinin derivat ives had not yet been document ed in the study settings in 2017, this prospect was of great concern to WHO and public health practitioners. Of special concern in the frame of the CARAMAL project was the fact that RAS is a monotherapy, and that the widespread use of artemisinin monotherapi es could increase drug pressure. The same problem is obviously also arising from parenteral use of artesunate, the currently recommended drug of choice for severe malaria , if not followed by an oral ACT as per WHO recommendations [10]. According to market data provided by MMV (www.severemalaria.org/severe -malaria -market -situation), the expected annual market for RAS is one million units per year, against 25 million doses of injectable artesunate. Hence the issue of monotherapy is potentially more related to the uncontrolled use of injectables rather than RAS. To monitor prospectively the frequency of resistance markers in the three study settings , a complementary study was implemented in coll aboration with the WHO Global Malaria Programme (GMP) . The project sampled children of different groups with malaria in the frame of the PSS at two time points (see Fig 4 above ) to measure the prevalence of molecular markers of artemisinin resistance (K13 -propeller sequence polymorphisms). Samples were collected as dried blood spots (DBS) on filter pape rs. The DBS were then sent APPENDICES xix to the WHO -contracted lab oratory at the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge in Phnom Pen for K13 genotyping . Details of the methods and the results are presented in a forthcoming publication (Awor et al . manuscript in preparation) . Data management Quantitative data was collected by trained field research teams and study nurses at referral health facilities using tablet computers and the ODK Collect application . ODK forms were designed by the CARAMAL research team. Data were transferred from tablets to the study database (ODK Aggregate server ) whenever a reliable internet connection was available. The data were s tored on dedicated secured ODK Aggregate server partitions at the Swiss TPH in Basel, Switzerland, and access restricted to study staff directly involved in data management and analysis. An automated daily backup of all the study data was made. Where electronic data capture was not feasible, qualitative and quantitative data were captured on paper forms ( or audio recorded if applicable) , and then transcribed to ODK Collect . Regular spot -checks and data quality audits were carried out to assess com pleteness and coherence . Ethical considerations The CARAMAL study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Review Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO ERC, No. ERC.0003008), the Ethics Committee of the University of Kinshasa School of Public Health (No. 012/2018), the Health Research Ethics Committee of the Adamawa State Ministry of Health (S/MoH/1131/I), the National Health Research Ethics Committee of Nigeria (NHREC/01/01/2007 - 05/05/2018), the Higher Degrees, Research and Ethics Committee o f the Makerere University School of Public Health (No. 548), the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST, No. SS 4534), and the Scientific and Ethical Review Committee of CHAI ( Date 21 Nov 2017 , #112 ). In addition, the study protocol was accepted by the national and local health authorities in all three implementation countries. The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03568344). Informed consent from the participant's parent or guardian was obtained prior to the inclusion into the PSS . Preliminary oral consent was asked at the primary care level because of the urgency of the child's clinical condition. This oral consent was followed by a written consent either at the referral health facility , or during the day 28 follow -up at home , whatever came first . Written consent was obtained separately from health workers prior to participating in the HCPS (Activity 2), and from h ousehold heads and parents/guardians of children < 5 years prior to participating in the HHS (Activity 3) . APPENDICES xx Results and discussion Patient Surveillance System (PSS ): key enrolment figures Across the three countries, health care workers at first contact provisionally enrolled 14,911 patients into the PSS. Of the se, 13,758 (92%) were fully enrolled, i.e. writ ten informed consent was provided and the day 28 follow -up was successfully completed. Despite a comparable population of children <5 years in the three countries (130,000 -200,000), there was a large difference in total enrolment numbers: DRC 5,540, Nigeri a 1,505, Uganda 6,713. Almost half of the children were enrolled directly at a referral health facility ( 6,131 , 45%) (Table Nigeria, most enrolments came from RHFs. In DRC, a minority of enrolments came from CHWs (a reflection of th e small number of these providers), while in Uganda, more enrolments came from CHWs than from PHCs , probably as a result of their large number (see also Table 1). Particularly in Nigeria, the proportion of PHC enrolments increased from pre-RAS (11%) to the post -RAS period (26%) , but overal l more children were recruited directly at the RHF level .

APPENDICES xxi Fig 6: Number of children enrolled in the Patient Surveillance System (grey bars), and percentage of these children being administered rectal artesunate (RAS), by country. APPENDICES xxii RAS rollout Detailed information on operational aspects of RAS rollout are available in Lambiris et al. (submitted ). Some key results are reported below. In DRC, the 100 mg RAS products from CiplaTM and Strides Pharma ScienceTM received marketing authorization in June 2017 and September 2017, respectively. RAS coverage increased rapidly and remained high after its initial introduction in March 2019 ( Fig 6a). In Nigeria, the 100 mg RAS product from Strides Pharma ScienceTM received marketing authorization in January 2019, and the product from CiplaTM in October 2019. Two procurements were initially anticipated to cover the needs of the study areas through the end of implementation in October 2020. However, civil protest and riots in July -August 2020 resulted in the looting of RAS storage facilities in Adamawa. A total of 7,577 RAS units were lost in the attack. RAS coverage increased inconsistently after introduction in April 2019 ( Fig 6b). In Uganda, both 100 mg RAS products from CiplaTM and Strides Pharma ScienceTM received marketing authorization in November 2018. RAS coverage increased steadily after its introduction in April 2019 , and a high RAS coverage was reached after 3 -4 month s (Fig 6c). Neither the timing of RAS distribution and trainings, nor other individual factors and contextual circums tances explain ed the observed patterns of RAS administration (data not shown). RAS was distributed to health workers at the community level immediately following the ir initial trainings. A total of 126,904 RAS units were procured for the three countries, and 91,189 units were distributed to over 8,000 trained CHWs and primary healthcare workers. The remaining RAS units were either distributed after the implementation pe riod, stored for future distribution, donated, or retrieved and incinerated if the recommended shelf -life had been reached. By 2020, the proportion of trained CHWs and peripheral healthcare workers who were actively engaged in administering RAS and submitt ing monthly reports ranged from 92% to 100% in the project countries . DRC: Distribution of RAS was from the provincial level to the Health Zones, and then to secondary health facilities. These facilities then distributed RAS to the primary health faciliti es and CHWs. The nurses in the secondary health facilities were responsible for monitoring commodity availability and replenishing stock on a monthly basis. Four units of RAS were provided to each health care provider. Initially, CHWs and primary health ca re facilities had to submit requests for stock replenishment, but because of the high frequency of stock outs , this method was replaced by the supervisor bringing the RAS during each monthly supervision. According to the HCPS at midline and endline, over 8 0% of CHWs and PHCs surveyed had received at least one supervision visit during the past 6 months. Nigeria: Distribution of RAS started at the State level, then to hospitals and further to the primary care/CHW level. Supervision visits and refresher trainings were conducted by different Federal and State actors, e.g. the National Malaria Control Programme/Federal Ministry of Health, Adamawa State Ministry of Health, and the Adamawa State Pri mary Health Care Development Agency. Hospital staff were responsible for supervising APPENDICES xxiii CHWs on a monthly basis. CHWs had to contact their supervisors when they were low on RAS. In practice, the CHW were then often asked to come to the health facility to pick new stock at their own expense. CHWs received only one pack (i.e. two capsules) of RAS at a time. The HCPS midline survey showed that 89.3% of CHWs and 97% of PHCs surveyed reported having received a supervisory visit within the last 6 months. A particular issue in Nigeria was the very high temperature (over 35oC daily average) during the months of January to June. Although the capsule structure prevented the artesunate suppositories from leaking even at high temperatures, the absence of cooling d evices at CHW and PHC levels reduced the shelf -life of RAS . Ongoing stability tests are being conducted and will be reported elsewhere (MMV manuscript in preparation). A lockdown due to the C OVID -19 pandemic was issued in Nigeria on the 30th of March 2020 restricting the movement of people and supplies. This has undoubtedly contributed to the drop in RAS administration and PSS enrolments during spring 2020 ( Fig 6b). Uganda: Quarterly review meetings at PHC facility level were set up to track commodities for reporting to the national level. Since this system was not responding fast enough, a monthly district -level ( parish ) coordinator meeting was set up by CHAI and implemented to support overcom ing logistics challenges. Supervision of CHWs was conducted in parallel with monthly parish coordinator meetings. Initially, CHWs were provided with one pack of RAS per quarter, based on predicted numbers of severe cases. This quantity was quickly shown to be insufficie nt, and subsequently CHWs were given at least two packs per quarter. According to the HCPS midline and endline survey s, over 85% of CHWs and 96% PHC facilities reported receiving at least one supervisory visit during the last 6 months. C OVID -19 had also an impact on the movement of persons and on the supply chain from April to June 2020. In Fig 6c, we observed a slight decline in RAS administration over that period, as well as a stagnation in PSS enrolments. Behaviour Change Communication In addition to su pplying RAS , CARAMAL partners helped also to design, pre -test, and roll -out behaviour change communication (BCC) messages and materials in all three countries , to stimulate community level sensitization and demand on the introduction of RAS. RAS dosing Evidence on dosing with RAS of study children was collected from slightly over 1000 study children (Fig 7). According to t he manufacturer's recommendation s, children between 6 months and 3 years should receive one 100 mg suppository, while children from 3 to 6 years of age should receive two suppositor ies. This recommendations could be leading to variable dosing because of low -weight -for-age children. In the CARAMAL study, the recommended dosing was not universally adhered to, and many children were unde r- dosed. In DRC, 83% of children over 3 years that were administered RAS received one suppository instead of APPENDICES xxiv two. In Nigeria the situation was best with only 32% of children over 3 years receiv ing one suppository, while in Uganda this percentage was 55%. Fig 7: Number of suppositories received by enrolled chil dren, by age group and country. yr=year. Missing=missing data. Key operational learnings Key operational learnings from RAS implementation in the three project countries included : 1. Lower -than -expected coverage (DRC) and utilization (Nigeria, Uganda) of CHWs in the project areas, in part because of frequent commodity stock -outs and personnel fluctuations. This undoubtedly reduced confidence in the CHWs ' ability to provide adequate and reliable t reatment. 2. Regular supportive supervisions substantially improved CHW engagement and performance, and were critical to a functioning RAS supply line. However, carrying o ut regular supervision visits was challenging from an operational, logistical and fi nancial perspective - despite the fact that in all three settings this was a routine task expected to be performed by the health system. 3. Need for regular restocking of RAS at the CHW level and mechanisms for internal redistribution, given the high varia bility in RAS needs: some CHW regularly used RAS, while others did not use a single dose during the study period. 4. Identification of numerous barriers to referral completion [26], especially socio -economic factors 5. Need for additional investment in the quality of care provided for severe malaria treatment at referral health facilities, including the provision of a full course of ACT post -parenteral treatment to complete the treatment ( Signorell et al. manuscript in preparation ). 6. Need for the strengthening of routine data systems at the CHW level, including the procurement and supply management (PSM) system s, and formal/informal private care provid ers. APPENDICES xxv Estimated rates of severe fe brile illness in study children It has been know n for some time that t here are many epidemiological, health system and clinical determinants driving the rates of severe febrile illness/malaria in a given setting [3]. Unfortunately , our empiric understanding of these determinants does not seem to have evolved much since the 1990s. Currently, rates of severe disease are derived entirely from modelling approaches [4] and reliable empirical estimates would usefully complement these appro aches. A rough estimation of the rates of severe febrile illnes s (independent ly of RAS treatment) could be computed within the CARAMAL study on the basis of the number of children with severe febrile illness recruited in the three sites (Table 2), and given the estimated number of children of that age group in the three settings (Table 1 ). DRC = 5,540 cases /1 45,107 children U5 = 0.03 8 or 38 per 1 ,000 for the 27 months of the study period ; or 16.9 per 1 ,000 and per year . Nigeria : 1,505/130,430 = 0.0 12 or 12 per 1 ,000 for the study period; or 5.3 per 1 ,000 and per year . Uganda : 6,713/200,518 = 0.0 33 or 33.5 per 1 ,000 for the study period; or 14.9 per 1 ,000 per year . These estimates are only approximations with substantial margins of error for at least four reasons. Firstly, the actual number of cases of febrile illn ess seen through the PSS is certainly below the real number occurring in the community , since not all children were brought to public providers for treatment . Unfortunately , we had no way to estimate this independently in this large population . Secondly, varying case definitions among the three sites undermined the representativ eness of the number of reported cases of \"severe febrile illness\" (see also Table 3 below). Severe febrile illness episodes as defined by iCCM can have multiple causes (not only mal aria), and represent on average a milder disease form than severe malaria as defined by the WHO (see below). Thirdly, access to prompt and effective antimalarial treatment at primary level is likely to influence the rate of progression from mild to severe disease [6, 13, 34] . Fourthly, up-to-date and accurate census figures were not available for the study areas, and hence the denominator s were only an estimation based o n best available data from public sources . All other parameters being equal, truly severe febrile episode case numbers were likely to be underestimated in Nigeria ( low numbers of enrolled children with probably high er average severity in patients leading to high CFR (Fig 8) and overestimated in Uganda (low CFR indicative of low average severity in patients) , while the DRC estimates were in -between . Nevertheless, these community severe febrile illness rates are probably among the best produced for any African setting to -date, and should have some utility. Overall Case Fatality Rates (CFR) The CFR differed significantly between the three countries, and in DRC also between both enrolment groups (Fig 8). The highest CFR wer e measured in Nigeria: 12.0% [95% CI 9.7 -14.8] at community level and 10.0% [95% CI 8.2 -12.3] at RHF level. The lowest CFR were found in Uganda (0.6% [95% CI 0.4 -0.9] at community level and 0.9% [95% CI 0.6 -1.3] at RHF level. In DRC, the CFR was substantia lly higher in community enrolments: the APPENDICES xxvi CFR, a pre -post RAS impact analysis, as well as an individual risk factor analysis for mortality and severe disease are presented in a forthcoming publication [25]. Fig 8: Overall case fatality ratio (CFR) across the entire study period , by enrolment location and country. Case definition s: iCCM versus WHO definition of severe malaria The difference in case definitions between severe febrile illness under iCCM and the classic WHO definition of severe malaria are shown in Table 3. A small but potentially significant difference between the two guidelines is that the target age group is different: below 5 years for iCCM, below 6 years in the WHO RAS guidelines. We did not assess the effect of this difference in the CARAMAL study. Table 3: Case definitions of severe febrile illness (as defined in the frame of iCCM) compared to the full medical definition of severe malaria. Severe febrile illness (iCCM [27]) Severe P. falciparum malaria - WHO case definition. For laboratory values, see [10] Fever over 37.5o C or a history of recent fever (essentially within the last 24 hours); plus one of the following danger signs: - Lethargy/unconsciousness - Refusal to feed/breastfeed - Convulsions - Repeated vomiting In the DR C only: - Unable to sit or stand up mRDT for malaria is optional One or more of the following, occurring in the absence of an identified alternative cause, and in the presence of P. falciparum asexual parasitaemia and in most cases fever. - Impaired consciousness: A Glasgow coma score < 11 in adults or a Blan tyre coma score < 3 in children - Prostration: Generalized weakness so that the person is unable to sit, stand or walk without assistance - Multiple convulsions: more than two episodes within 24 h - Acidosis; severe acidosis manifested clinically as respiratory distress (rapid, deep, laboured breathing) - Hypoglycaemia - Severe malarial anaemia - Renal impairment - Pulmonary oedema - Significant bleeding - Shock - Hyperparasitaemia APPENDICES xxvii This lack of overlap between the two case definitions has at least two implications for pract ice. Firstly, the inability to estimate correctly the true rates of severe malaria in the community has already been noted above , and represents an important limitation for tracking progress in malaria disease control . Possibly, recommending systematically an mRDT to febrile children with signs/ symptoms of disease severity , could prevent unnecessary RAS pre -referral treatment. This approach has been shown to be feasible and safe [35]. This was also the case in the CARAMAL study. Secondly , there seem to be a case for exploring in more detail the significance of some of th e iCCM severity signs in children for their prognostic value , in a way similar to what was done for clinical and laboratory parameters of severe malaria [7]. This could for example be assessed for \"Refusal to feed/bre astfeed\" or \"Repeated vomiting\", which are not strictly indicators of severe disease. This could lead to re -assessing their value for initiating systematically a referral, with all its difficulties a nd uncertainties, and possibly recommend a wait -and-see strategy instead , with or without RAS administration . Conclusions With over 9 ,000 episodes of severe febrile illness enrolled at the primary care level, the CARAMAL project aimed to document comprehensively key determinants of RAS effectiveness . The present project overview presented the project scope, objectives , metho dological approaches , RAS implementation , and gave some key operational results . Using a comprehensive treatment seeking frame work for severe febrile illness/severe malaria , the CARAMAL project document ed systematically patients, communities and health systems in three remote, highly malaria -endemic setting (in DRC, Nigeria and Uganda ). We also documented the RAS under -dosing pro blem, as well as the difficulties of getting enough RAS doses to all relevant health care workers in time. Finally, the comprehensive Patient Surveillance System was used to calculate empirical rates of severe febrile illness, as well as compute fatality r ates of these patients, which were in excess of published values for hospitalized patients in two of the three countries (DRC and Nigeria). Effective c ase management for severe malaria episodes requires a large number of actions to be completed in success ion, including the availability of at least five commodities: an mRDT and RAS at primary level, a confirmatory test for malaria at the RHF, injectable artesunate (or any other approved parenteral drug) plus the required supportive treatments, and finally a full course of an ACT. This continuum of care was comprehensively documented by the CARAMAL project. As noted repeatedly elsewhere, improving the functioning of health facilities at all level s, as well as strengthening other sources of care (for example in the private sector ), is key to lasting improvements of health in Africa, including for malaria [36-38]. A specific issue raised in the CARAMAL study was the non -overlapping case definitions between severe febrile illness and severe malaria, and we highlighted two practical issues arising from this. APPENDICES xxviii A number of companion papers will present specific results on RAS impact [25], the re ferral process and its problems [26], post -referral car e [Signorell et al . manuscript in preparation] and the cost -effectiveness of RAS [Lambiris et al ., submitted ]. In addition , a number of country -specific publications will document in more detail the specifics of RAS implementation and impact in each projec t country. The CARAMAL consortium's experiences in rolling out RAS in the project countries generated a comprehensive understanding of specific operational challenges that other countries will confront, as well as potential solutions for overcoming them. Hence, it is hoped that CARAMAL will make a lasting contribution to improving malaria disease and mortality in the most highly malaria -endemic countries in the world.
