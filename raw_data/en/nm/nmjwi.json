Aggravated levels of 125 psychological distress ought to be recognised as a public health priority, and s olutions 126 are needed to address the consequences so that the potential current mental health 127 conditions do not become disabilities . Therefore, the Expert Panel on effective ways of 128 investing in health (EXPH) was requested to provide an opinion on supporting the mental 129 health of the health workforce and of other essential workers. 130 131 The Opinion identifies the specific factors influencing the mental health of the health 132 workforce and of other essential workers . It describes the evidence on effective and/or 133 promising interventions, and provides evidence on cost-effectiveness , where available; 134 due consideration was given to providing for the needs of those with pre -existing mental 135 health issues . The characteristics of those interventions are described, elaborating on the 136 necessary preconditions to ensure the efficient delivery of these interventions in a n 137 effective, cost-effective, affordable and inclusive manner , across settings and 138 jurisdictions . On the basis of this evidence, recommendations and action points were 139 developed , emphasis ing the importance of involving both of EU and national policy 140 makers alike, as well as raising awareness and engaging senior managers in sectors with 141 a high share of essential workers , and, last, but not least as well as mental health and 142 occupational health practitioners. 143 144 Mental health , defined as lack of mental illness and high levels of mental wellbeing, is 145 influenced by a co mplex interplay of determinants. A t work, occupation -specific 146 of me ntal h ealth interact with non-occupational -specific characteristics. A 147 conceptual framework has been developed to represent mental health state, 148 determinants / factors, and possible mental health trajectories over time in the face of a 149 given stressor . The framew ork illustrates the potential impact of primary, secondary and 150 tertiary prevention interventions occurring at various levels: the health and 151 social/community care sectors, workplace -level interventions (such as occupational 152 health programs and managerial -level changes), and economic/social policy measures. 153 Mental health of essential workers can therefore be supported by interventions enacted 154 within and outside of the health sector at primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention 155 levels. Interventions in multi ple settings at various levels can work synergistically to 156 address a wide range of risk factors and potentiate a wide range of protective factors. 157 The Swiss cheese model of accident causation is a helpful heuristic to illustrate this 158 synergy. This model de monstrates the need for multiple interventions targeting multiple 159 risk and protective factors occurring at multiple levels to ensure that all individuals 160 benefit from them and no one individual is left behind. It suggests the priorities of 161 different levels of interventions, from large scale interventions supporting the largest 162 share of essential workers, to the interventions targeting organisational and team 163 characteristics, job characteristics and lastly targeting modifiable individual 164 characteristics. Spe cifically, post -traumatic stress disorder, burnout and moral injury are 165 associated with working in stressful conditions, and could be anticipated and prevented in 166 the workplace , or addressed when present. 167 168 Based on available evidence and identified limita tions, gaps and challenges, eight 169 recommendations with several action points are developed: focus on mental wellbeing; 170 treat mental wellbeing as an inherent part of the workplace and its organisation ; create a 171 supportive institutional framework at EU -level; create an appropriate cost -effectiveness 172 framework; build and share knowledge on interventions; define a common vision for 173 mental health care; prepare organisations and their leaders; and provide timely and 174 adequate access to care when preventive effor ts are not effective . 175 176 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 5 Keywords: Expert Panel on effective ways of investing in Health, mental health , 177 wellbeing, healthcare workers, essential workers, risk factors, interventions, 178 implementation, delivery conditions 179 180 181 Opinion t o be cited as: 182 183 Expert Panel on effective ways of investing in Health (EXPH), Supporting mental health of 184 health workforce and other essential workers , 2021 185 186 \u00a9 European Union, 189 doi:xxxx ND-xxx 190 191 http://ec.europa.eu/health/expert_panel/index_en.htm 192 193 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 6 TABLE OF CONTENTS 194 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS ................................ ................................

Multiple contribut ing factors such as anxiety 222 (including , because of the lack of personal protective equipment (PPP) ) and exceptionally 223 high workload , often led to burnout. This increased burden of psychological distress 224 ought to be recognised as a public health priority . Interventions to immediately support 225 the mental health and alleviate the consequences of stress, fear, and moral injury are 226 urgently required . These actions are needed to adequately address the major threat to 227 the long -term mental health of large numbers of essential workers and to the 228 sustainability of the health workforce and of health systems. Enhanced emotional and 229 social support is critical to protect from long -term disability , particularly given the 230 sustained effect of system pressure on people and health systems due to COVID -19. 231 In th is Opinion , we identif y those factors influencing the mental health of the health 232 workforce and of other essential workers ; evidence on promising interventions is 233 examined regarding effectiveness and, where available, cost -effectiveness. We set out 234 the characteristics of interventions that could be effective, including for people who have 235 pre-existing mental health conditions and we discuss their cost-effective ness, 236 affordab ility, and inclusive delivery. 237 The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines mental health a s \"a state of mental 238 wellbeing in which people cope well with the many stresses of life, can realize their own 239 potential, can function productively and fruitfully, and are able to contribute to their 240 communities\" . Optimal mental health involves the absence of m ental illness and a high 241 level of mental wellbeing. However, existing r esearch has focuse d more on the mental 242 illness rather than on the mental wellbeing. Our understanding on mental illness and 243 mental health lags far behind our understanding of physical h ealth, particularly given the 244 lack of definitive biological markers and diagnostic challenges . Mental illness is often 245 associated with s tigma , a critical barrier in itself determining health -seeking behaviour 246 and, ultimately, access to care. Mental health is influenced by risk and protective factors 247 both within and around the individual. Furthermore, the c omplex interplay of 248 determinants, both occupation -specific and generic, necessitates a comprehensive 249 framework with an array of intervention s, across sect ors, settings and levels . These 250 should act synergistically to tackle the wide and diverse range of r isk factors whilst 251 enhancing the effect of protective factors , ensuring no one is left behind . 252 We propose a conceptual framework to represent this complexity, including possible 253 mental health trajectories in response to stress over time . The framework includes 254 primary, secondary and tertiary prevention across levels: the role of health and 255 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 8 social/community care sectors, workplace inter ventions (such as occupational health 256 programs and manage ment policies ), and economic/social policy measures. We note that 257 there are still many evidence gaps to inform comprehensive policies. Surveys often lack 258 methodological robustness, i.e., inadequate sample size, limited representativeness and 259 generalisability . Currently, most available research on mental health , both before 260 pandemic and during the pandemic, does not adequately address functional aspects of 261 mental health or of mental wellbeing. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), burnout 262 and moral injury can be anticipated. Prevention must be the first priority, and 263 appropriate treatment used should preventive measures fail. 264 We describe factors that increase or decrease the risk of adverse mental h ealth outcomes 265 in the healthcare workers at individual, service and societal level s. People with mental 266 health conditions have a lower life expectancy and generally poorer health outcomes due 267 to the complex interplay of socioeconomic and behavioural risk f actors, often accentuated 268 by barriers to accessing care. Therefore, safeguarding access to mental health services 269 during the pandemic is an urgent need . The need for further research should also be 270 recognised and prioritised to help understand longer -term mental health impacts. 271 Effective interventions to protect mental health of essential workers are likely to be 272 complex and multi -faceted, addressing modifi able risk factors to be implemented across 273 multiple levels. 274 In the context of the Opinion devel opment, evidence from multiple sources, 275 encompassing best practices, guidelines, toolkits , among others, was reviewed . This 276 allowed for the identification of c oordinated integrated approaches to support mental 277 health of essential workers . Despite the lack robust evidence on the effectiveness of 278 interventions designed to address the mental health needs of workers with or without 279 pre-existing mental health conditions, training healthcare workers in resilience may be 280 particularly effective for those with a his tory of mental ill -health . A wide range of mental 281 health support services that can meet the diverse needs of groups with different 282 vulnerabilities and risks should also be made available. Due to potential stigma and 283 discrimination, efforts in the workplace to support mental health should be accompanied 284 by due consideration of legal and ethical responsibilities. The excess burden of mental 285 health issues in the health workforce is well-described , however assessing cost- 286 effectiveness of interventions to addres s them remains complex given the challenges in 287 quantifying the impacts to assess (economic, societal, ethical, etc.). 288 Service d elivery conditions are conceptualized in this Opinion using an implementation 289 science framework , which posits that t he success of implementation depends on how its 290 delivery is organised and is context-dependent . Contextual factors such culture and 291 leadership can largely influence implementation outcomes , whereas resource constraints 292 and barriers, as well as facilitators are also examined. Specifically, we identified several 293 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 9 core conditions for the delivery of mental health services . With respect to the 294 intervention, meeting and adapting to evolving user needs was important, as well as 295 assessing the role of stigma, whilst ensuring those with a history of mental health and/or 296 pre-disposing factors are not targeted . Many delivery conditions focused on the 297 workplace and included ensur ing safe space and processes (e.g., for help -seeking ) and 298 foster ing an environment of trust; training in mental health assessment and key delivery 299 conditions for occupational health practitioners and managers while emphasising that 300 there should be no adverse consequences for help -seeking behaviour; and driving 301 transformation in organisational cult ure towards one of acceptance of the continuum of 302 mental health issues . To support workplace interventions , a clear and comprehensive 303 regulatory and financial structure and mechanisms of support are required. Attention to 304 public and private sector organisa tions, including multinational corporations (MCNs) and 305 small - and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs ) is needed. These enabling structures should 306 encompass sustainable support for long -term prevention and treatment programs, and 307 research and development of inn ovative approaches , such as de-stigmatization, care re - 308 organization, regulatory frameworks, and data collection and harmonization initiatives. 309 The EU Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) stipulates that general 310 occupational safety and health risk assessment in the workplace is a legal obligation of all 311 employers in the EU . Through its guidelines, EU -OSHA reaffirms th at these stipulations 312 are equally applicable with regards to the mental health of wo rkers. EU-OSHA 313 recommends participatory psychosocial risk assessment be included as part of the 314 occupational safety and health requirement , and used to identify risks and to inform 315 intervention design . Further, EU -OSHA recognizes that s ome mental health pr oblems 316 may be caused or aggravated by poor psychosocial work environment , incl uding , 317 excessive time pressure, conflict, violence, harassment, lack of support, and/or lack of 318 appreciation . Those factors should be identified and addresse d in both preventive and 319 remedial means, and in a complementary manner . Protection of workers ' mental health is 320 an integral part of occupational safety and health. 321 The Opinion concludes with eight evidence -based recommendations, complemented by 322 action points with EU -wide and M ember -State relevance . The recommendations are 323 addressed to policy makers and managers in sectors with a high share of essential 324 workers , as well as with mental health and occupational health practitioners . The focus of 325 these recommendations to support the mental health of essential workers is on fostering 326 their mental wellbeing and the need to treat mental wellbeing as a n organisational 327 responsibility within the workplace . The recommendations address the roles of 328 stakeholders at several levels ( organi sations, national authorities and EU). The action 329 points detail the general principle described in each recommendation. Specifically, t here 330 is the need for appropriate guidance frameworks to be established, in some cases 331 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 10 deserving legal status, to clearly estab lish mental wellbeing as a n important workplace 332 responsibility within organisations. This requires awareness and competencies by the 333 leadership of organisations, which can be facilitated via education and training. To 334 support promotion of mental wellbeing in SMEs, the use of common digital tools (to be 335 developed ) can be advantageous. In addition, w orkplaces must develop a dequate 336 mechanisms for early identification of factors influencing mental wellbeing and for 337 referral to professional help when preventive efforts are not effective. T he organisation, 338 as opposed to the individual worker, is to be held accountable for worker wellbeing . 339 Building and sharing knowledge on interventions that work via the creation of learning 340 communities is recommended. The identif ication of best practices that are cost -effective 341 require further evidence, which should be developed by overcoming m ethodological 342 challenges . Lastly, a common vision for mental health care and its re-organi sation is 343 needed with emphasis on prevention and support of mental wellbeing in not only 344 essential workers, but the general population as a whole. 345 BACKGROUND (mandate) 346 Essential workers, whether in the health or other sectors, have been hit hard by the 347 consequences of the COVID -19 pandemic. This is not j ust due to the risk of infection 348 arising from close contact with patients, the general public , and potentially infectious co - 349 workers . Although less well recognised, they have also faced risks to their mental 350 health.1 351 The list of those at risk is long. They include healthcare personnel, long term care 352 workers, teachers, cleaners, cooks, emergency personnel (police, fire department, civil 353 protection), people working in transport, agriculture and food production, critical retail 354 facilities (grocery stores, hard ware stores), critical trades (construction workers, 355 electricians, plumbers etc.), water and wastewater workers , energy and distribution , 356 those delivering social service s, and other s that manage critical infrastructure and 357 services. 358 When the Covid -19 pand emic hit, many essential workers had no choice but to continue 359 working physically at their workplace to provide services for others at great risk to their 360 own health and that of their families. We now know that many were exposed to a high 361 risk of COVID -19.2 If infected, some were also at greater risk of becoming ill or 362 transmitting the infection to others. They include d elderly workers, people from low - 363 income households, worke rs with underlying health conditions (e.g. chronic illness), 364 those with existing mental health issues, workers in temporary or informal employment, 365 and refugees and some migrant s. 366 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 11 A Health at a Glance: Europe 2020 report points to several factors that adv ersely 367 affected the mental health of health workers: lack of personal protective equipment, the ir 368 exceptionally high workload , and the psychological pressure faced by health 369 professionals.3 An Ital ian survey of health care , in March 2020 , reported frequent 370 symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia, especially amongst frontline 371 workers and young women.4 In April 2020 a Spanish survey reported that 57% of health 372 workers had with symptoms of post -traumatic stress disorder.5 373 In response to this evidence , support services for health workers in many countries were 374 expanded to help them deal with the high level of stress, fatigue and psychological 375 distress during these extremely challengin g times, for example through peer support 376 groups or dedicated phone support lines. Yet despite the growing number of studies on 377 the mental health consequences of the pandemic on health care workers, there is much 378 less on the situation faced by essential wo rkers in other sectors , although the European 379 Commission did set up a virtual network of (not -for-profit) stakeholder organizations on 380 its Health Policy Platform to discuss and share knowledge and practices on COVID19 - 381 related mental health issues . This inc ludes guidance to help address the mental health 382 aspects of the COVID19 -pandemic. There have also been initiatives to provid e 383 psychological support to the general population, for example through online advice or 384 phone hotlines . However less is known about what employers have been doing to support 385 their employees , especially those with pre-existing mental health conditions and how, if 386 at all, these link to health services, and especially primary care . 387 The Expert Panel on Effective ways of Investing in Health (EXPH) highlighted in a 388 previous opinion that measures to tackle psychological distress should be recognised as a 389 public health priority.6 Comprehensive strategies , rapidly implemented, with clear lines of 390 accountability were needed to reduce the adverse mental health consequences of the 391 pandemic but were largely lacking. Now, as there is beginning to be some reason for 392 optimism, it will be essential to put in place measures that can minimise the threats to 393 the mental health of essent ial workers going forward and ensure that those already 394 affected can recover without long term disability. 395 This means that we need innovative solutions , combining societal, organisational, team 396 and individual responses, with engagement by all those who can provide the necessary 397 psychosocial support. 398 The primary target audience of this opinion comprises those responsible for policy 399 and health, employment, and recovery from the pandemic at national and EU level, as 400 well as senior managers in sectors with high shares of essential workers. It should also 401 be of interest to mental health and occupational health practitioners. 402 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 12 QUESTIONS FOR THE EXPERT PANEL 403 1.) What are the specific factors influencing mental health of the health workforce and 404 essential workers? 405 2.) What interventions could be effective in addressing mental health support needs 406 of health workers and essential workers, including those with preexisting mental 407 health conditions? Using existing data, assess the cost of mental health problems 408 in the health workforce and the cost -effectiveness of mental health interventions. 409 What are the conditions for the delivery of these interventions in a cost -effective, 410 affordable and inclusive manner? 411 3.) How can the EU address these concerns? 412 1. OPINION 413 1.1. What are the specif ic factors influencing mental health of the health 414 workforce and of \"other essential workers\"? 415 General overview of mental health 416 Mental health can be envisaged as a two -dimensional concept (Figure 1). On one 417 dimension lies a continuum , that could be described as pathogenic or illness focused, 418 from no mental illness to serious mental illness. On another, and arguably a more 419 important dimension is salutogenic ,7 or health focused, comprising a spectrum of ability 420 to function. This salutogenic approach is aligned with The World Health Organization 's 421 definition of mental health as \"a state of mental wellbeing in which people cope well with 422 the many stresse s of life, can realize their own potential, can function productively and 423 fruitfully, and are able to contribute to their communities .\"8 Wellbeing is typically 424 assessed via endorsement of items like: feeling cheerful and in good spirits, feeli ng calm 425 and relaxed, feeling active and vigorous, waking up fresh and relaxed, and feeling like 426 daily life is filled with things that interest me [e.g., the World Health Organization - Five 427 Wellbeing Index (WHO -5)9]. 428 Some authors refer to this as the continuum between flourishing/ thriving and 429 languishing/surviving.10,11 In Figure 1, optimal mental health is present at the 430 intersection between high mental wellbeing and lack of mental illness. The \"whole health 431 approach\" to supporting the mental health of essential workers requires all addressing 432 both mental illness services and mental health promotion and protection. 433 Figure 1. The two dimensions of mental health 434 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 13 435 Less than optimal mental health occurs when a person s hows signs or symptoms of 436 mental illness and/or mental wellbeing affecting their everyda y function. If this is well 437 managed, he/she may be able to restore his/her mental health to optimal levels . 438 However, if not effectively managed, they may lead to sub -optimal mental health leaving 439 the individual concerned unable to fu nction day-to-day. 440 The signs and symptoms of mental health are many and complex. Common mental 441 illnesses include depression (sadness and loss of interest in previously enjoyable 442 activities, possible suicidal ideation), anxiety disorders (excessive, debili tating worrying), 443 and post -traumatic stress disorder (long -term symptoms in response to a traumatic 444 event, including re -experiencing the event via nightmares and/or intrusive memories). At 445 the risk of generalisation, r esearch tends to focus on the mental i llness dimension of 446 mental health than the mental wellbeing one. Yet mental wellbeing has received 447 considerable attention in the media, which has been especially concerned about the 448 psychological and emotional impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic .12-14 449 Our understanding of mental illness and health often lags far behind our understanding of 450 physical health. Identifying and treating mental health disorders is more complex than 451 treating bodily illness or injury. Many m ental illnesses lack definitive biological markers 452 and signs/ symptoms can be interpreted in different ways . Mental illness symptoms may 453 manifest as cognitive, emotional, behavioural, and/or physical (or bodily/somatic) 454 phenomena , making it challenging to rule out alternative diagnoses although there are 455 now many assessment tools, typically based on questionnaires, designed to use with 456 mental wellbeing and mental health/illness. 457 As with a physical illness, diagnosis depends on someone seeking help, overcoming the 458 many barriers that exist to doing so. However, there are additional problems when 459 someone has mental health problems because they may not recognise them or they may 460 fear the s tigma that is often associated with them .15 461 Serious Mental Illness No Mental IllnessFlourishing / Thriving Languishing / SurvivingOPTIMAL MENTAL HEALTH: High mental well -being & lack of mental illnessHigh mental well -being & mental illness Low mental well -being & mental illnessLow mental well -being & lack of mental illnessSupporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 14 Conceptual Framework 462 The mandate asks how the EU can support the mental health of the health workforce and 463 other essential workers. To do so, it is first necessary to have a framework to understand 464 mental health and its ca uses. These causes involve a complex interplay of biological, 465 environmental, cultural, economic, health system, social, occupational, familial, 466 psychological , and individual factors. Risk factors increase vulnerability to experiencing 467 adverse mental health , whereas protective factors do the opposite. They can assist 468 recovery after exposure to stress (harm -reduction approach), protect against adverse 469 mental health prior to stress (protection approach), and/or promote positive aspects of 470 mental health (promot ion approach).16 471 A life-course approach highlights the importance of prior and current experiences .17 Thus, 472 the mental health of a person at a given point is influenced by a combination of prior and 473 current experiences , risk factors, and protective f actors . In the present context, 474 occupation -specific factors influencing mental health that have become especially 475 apparent during the COVID -19 pandemic are of particular importance. This calls for an 476 emphasis on the workplace. To help us, we have develope d a conceptual framework that 477 provides a visual representation of the factors that we must consider to effectively and 478 efficiently support the mental health of essential workers. The framework includes 479 interventions to provide primary, secondary and tertiary prevention across sectors, 480 settings and levels, the most relevant being: the health and social/community care 481 sectors ; the workplace (such as occupational health programs and managerial -level 482 changes), and within the wider economic and social policy arena ( Figure 2). 483 Figure 2. Conceptual framework for supporting the mental health of the health workforce 484 and other essential workers 485 486 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 15 Source: The authors 487 488 The focus of Figure 2 is the individual's mental health profile at a given point in time, 489 represented by the two -dimensional grid of mental illness and mental wellbeing 490 presented earlier . Risk and protective factors interact to influence this profile . Given the 491 focus of this Opinion, we consider non-occupation -specific (e.g., biological, social - 492 environmental, and psychological ), which then interact with occupation -specific factors 493 such as characteristics of jobs, teams, and organizations, all within a broader policy 494 context. These individually and collectively influence the mental health trajectory of the 495 individual concerned. 496 We can illustrate this by looking at a theoretical chain of events. W e begin at the box 497 labelled \"Mental Health Profile\". One or more stressor s occurs (for instance related t o the 498 COVID -19 pandemic ). Whether this leads to a deterioration in the individuals mental 499 health depends on how the individual responds . If they are able to cope with the 500 stressor (s), then he/she is likely to maintain his/her current level of mental health . This 501 is the top trajectory in Figure 2. However, the ability to cope can change over time. We 502 can expect a worsening of mental health i f (i) the stressor is very traumatic and/or 503 prolonged over time and/or there is an accumulation of multiple stressors a nd (ii) the 504 person is especially susceptible to the stressor(s) at that time due to the complex 505 interplay of factors that determine mental health and individual thresholds . The extent of 506 deterioration will depend on the initial mental health profile and the interac tion of 507 occupation -and non -occupation -specific risk and protective factors. 508 This is represented by trajectories 1 and 2 , with trajectory 1 involving less severe 509 deterioration than trajectory 2. In each case recovery may occur spontaneously, 510 depending on the initial mental health profile and the combination of risk and protective 511 factors . There may be a variety of interventions that can influence modifiable 512 risk/protective factors and /or mitigate the effects of the stressor (primary prevention), 513 while others might mitigate impact of the stressor on mental health and/or promote rapid 514 recovery from the stressor (secondary prevention), and/or decrease the rate of 515 deteriorating mental health (tertiary prevention) . In each of these trajectories, there are 516 two further pathways, a and b. In scenario 2a, the mental health of the individual 517 continuously deteriorate s over time without effective secondary prevention but remain 518 stable at a low level with effective tertiary prevention. S cenario 1a, compared to scenario 519 2a, illustrates how secondary prevention reduces the extent of mental health 520 deterioration caused by the stressor. In both b scenarios, mental health eventually 521 recovers , return ing to baseline in scenario 1b bu t not in scenario 2b. Thus, besides 522 influencing the initial level of deterioration caused by the stressor, secondary prevention 523 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 16 can prompt a faster recovery , an earlier recovery, and/or a more complete recovery and 524 return to baseline mental health . 525 Figure 2 illustrates the important aspects of mental health covered thus far and sets the 526 stage for the other chapters in this Opinion. First, an ind ividual's mental health at a given 527 point falls on a two-dimensional continuum of mental illness and mental wellbeing . 528 Second, m ental health is influenced by a complex interplay of determinants. The figure 529 includes a simplified Venn diagram to show three non-occupation -specific factor 530 groupings - biological factors, social and environmental factors, and psycholog ical 531 factors. Vulnerabilities might include genetic predisposition to mental illness , lack of 532 social or familial support, economic difficulties, and/or psychological traits such as 533 strategies to cope with stress or cognitive tendencies like optimism vs. pe ssimism. 534 Third, given the mandate's focus on essential workers during the COVID -19 pandemic, 535 occupation -specific determinants of mental health interact with these non-occupational - 536 specific characteristics. T hree different occupation al groups are likely to respond 537 different ly to a stressor such as those arising in the COVID -19 pandemic. Health workers 538 may be under severe pressure from increased workload, in addition to being concerned 539 about contracting the virus and suffering from moral injury . Other essential workers, 540 such as those in the food or transport industry , may also be concerned about the 541 possibility of contracting the virus , but may be less exposed, but may instead experience 542 increased pressure from working long hours . Non-essential workers may also experience 543 their own pressures working from home for a prolonged time , managing simultaneous 544 stressors such as isola tion and lack of social contact, and/or financial consequences of 545 being furloughed. Evidence on risk and protective factors for ess ential workers will be 546 examined in detail in C hapter 2. 547 Fourth, m ental health can be supported by interventions enacted within and outside of 548 the health sector at primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention levels. This is especially 549 relevant for essenti al workers. For example, an employer can design and implement 550 internal policies to increase support employees under stress , or help to organise care 551 outside the organis ation if needed and wanted . There is also scope for primary 552 preventative interventions, e.g. by employers who allow employees a certain degree of 553 control over their workload or work tasks , or government interventions to ensure a 554 minimum income level or to develop healthy lifestyles. Available evidence regarding 555 promising and effective interve ntions to support the mental health of essential workers 556 will be explored in Chapter 3, and cost -effective interventions will be described in the 557 Chapter 4. Delivery conditions for the implementation of interventions to support the 558 mental health of essenti al workers is covered in Chapter 5. 559 Interventions in multiple settings at various levels can work synergistically to address a 560 wide range of risk factors and potentiate a wide range of protective factors. Although the 561 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 17 relationship between exposure and outcome in mental health is complex and often far 562 from straightforward, the Swiss cheese model18 of accident causation used in risk 563 analysis and risk management is a helpful heuristic to illustrate this synergy. See Figure 564 3. 565 Figure 3. The Swiss Cheese model for supporting mental health in essential workers 566 567 Source: Reason's Swiss cheese model combining person and systems approaches to 568 human fallibility ,19 adapted by the authors 569 570 The Swiss Cheese model assumes optimal levels of mental health at the start and 571 provides a visual rep resentation of how to prevent further mental health deterioration. I t 572 does not provide a complete roadmap to achieving optimal mental health , but it is a 573 particularly valuable heuristic for supporting the mental h ealth of essential workers for 574 four main reasons. First, its use in safety and occupational health means that there is 575 already some familiarity with the model by those who need to use it. Second, it places 576 responsibility for mental health on both the individual and the system. The person 577 approach focuses on individual -level interventions, whereas a systems approach 578 concentrates on the interactions among the individual, his/her employment conditions , 579 and the regulatory/policy environment . Each slice of the cheese represents interventions 580 at different levels that contribute to mental health of employees. For instance, i t 581 illustrates attempts by workplace leadership to build safeguards, barriers, and defences 582 to prevent deterioration in mental health. Third, it recognizes that any safeguard or 583 intervention will have inherent flaws or \"holes\". The \"holes\" in this example are 584 unaddressed risk and/or protective factors. Mental health deterioration will occur when 585 multiple \"holes\" line up leaving workers exposed . This demonstrates the need for 586 multip le interventions targeting multiple risk and protective factors occurring across 587 levels to ensure that all individuals benefit equally from them , incl. the most vulnerable, 588 and no one individual is left behind. Lastly, the Swiss Cheese model illustrates th e 589 priority given to different levels of interventions. The first slices of the cheese are large - 590 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 18 scale, broad economic and social policy interventions designed to support the largest 591 numbers of essential workers. For those individuals who need additional support , the 592 next level targets the workplace organizational and team characteristics. For those who 593 need additional support, there are interventions to address specific job characteristics. 594 The last level introduces individual -level interventions, which can be expected to be 595 effective as along as interventions on other levels are in place. 596 1.2. Specific factors influencing mental health of the health workforce 597 and other essential workers 598 Exposure of e ssential workers to SARS -CoV-2 599 Supporting the mental he alth of the work ers has been an important priority of the World 600 Health Organization (WHO) for many years.20 This has become especially salient as a 601 result of t he COVID -19 pandemic. Particular emphasis ha s been placed on the \"essential\" 602 worker, who was required to continue working on-site during the most severe periods , 603 while, i n order to contain the virus, millions of \"non-essential\" workers were confined to 604 their homes, either unable to work or tele -working as possible. Each Member State 605 determine d their own lists of \"essential workers\" , encompassing individuals who perform 606 a range of services and operations in industries that are necessary to ensure the 607 continu ity of critical functions of a country and maintain critical infrastructure. As defined 608 in the mandate, e ssential workers include the health and care workforce, teachers, 609 cleaners, cooks, emergency personnel (police, fire department, civil protection), peo ple 610 working in transport, agriculture and food production, critical retail (grocery stores, 611 hardware stores), critical trades (construction workers, electricians, plumbers , etc.), 612 water and wastewater management, energy production and distribution, social service 613 organisation and other sectors that manage critical infrastructure and services. These 614 essential workers continued their jobs on the frontline throughout the COVID -19 615 pandemic , facing potential risks to their own health and the health of their love d ones as 616 a result of higher exposure risk to SARS -CoV-2. 617 Compared to non -essential workers, essential workers did experience a higher risk of of 618 getting infected by SARS -CoV-2 and of experiencing severe COVID -19, with a higher risk 619 of severe COVID -19 defined as being hospitalized or deceased , compared to non - 620 essential workers .21 In March 2020 , the United States Occupational Safety and Health 621 Administration ( US-OSHA) classified essential worker types based on risk of occupational 622 exposure to SARS -CoV-2. The level of risk depend ed on (i) the industry type, (ii) the 623 need for contact within 6 feet of people known to be, or suspected of being, infected with 624 SARS -CoV-2, and (iii) the requirement for repeated or extended contact with (a) 625 person (s) known to be, or suspected of being, infected with SARS -CoV-2.22 See Table 1. 626 Table 1 Classification of essential workers by risk of exposure 627 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 19 Level of Risk Definition Types of Essential Workers Very high or high exposure risk Those with high potential for exposure to known or suspected sources of COVID -19 during specific medical, post -mortem, or laboratory procedures. Healthcare workers (e.g., doctors, nurses, dentists, paramedics, emergency medical technicians) performing aerosol -generating procedures Healthcare or laboratory personnel collecting or handling specimens Morgue workers performing autopsies High exposure risk Those with high potential for exposure to known or suspected sources of COVID -19. Healthcare delivery and support staff (e.g., doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff who must enter patients' rooms) exposed to known or suspected COVID -19 patients. Medical transport workers (e.g., ambulance vehicle operators) moving known or suspected COVID -19 patients in enclosed vehicles. Mortuary workers involved in preparing (e.g., for burial or cremation) the bodies Medium exposure risk Those that require frequent and/or close contact with (i.e. , within 6 feet of) people who may be infected with SARS - CoV-2, but who are not known or suspected COVID -19 patients. Essential workers in contact be with the general public (e.g., in schools, high - population -density work environments, and some high -volume retail settings). Essential workers in frequent contact with travel lers who may return from international locations with widespread COVID -19 transmission. Lower Exposure Risk Those that do not require contact with people known to be, or suspected of being, infected with SARS - CoV-2 nor frequent close contact with (i.e., within 6 feet of) the general public Essential workers in minimal occupational contact with the public and other co -workers. Source: US -OSHA22 628 In this Opinion, e ssential workers have been divided into large groups based on their 629 involvement or lack of involvement in healthcare -related activities. Essential healthcare 630 worke rs have been defined as \"all paid and unpaid persons serving in healthcare settings 631 who have the potential for direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials. 632 This includes persons not directly involved in patient care, but potentially exp osed to 633 infectious agents while working in a healthcare setting .\"23 Informal carers fall into this 634 group. All these individuals are referred to as the health workforce and include workers of 635 varying levels of exposure risk . 636 It is important to note that women are over -represented in many of the sectors defined 637 as essential workers. In the EU, women make up 76% of healthcare workers , 76% of 638 those working in the care sector , and 82% of supermarket cashiers.24 The European 639 Institute for Gender Equality advocates for gender mainstreaming in crisis situations to 640 ensure tha t increased challenges to occupational health and wellbeing of women essential 641 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 20 workers are recognised and addressed. Similarly, essential workers are 642 disproportionately from minorities groups and also face increased challenges.25 643 Essential workers and mental health 644 As described in the mandate, cross-sectional survey data collected early in the COVID -19 645 pandemic from healthcare workers indicates that approximately half of them reported 646 symptoms of PTSD5, 25% reported symptoms of depression , 22% reported symptoms of 647 stress, 20% reported anxiety symptoms, and 8% reported ins omnia, with women more 648 likely than men to experience symptoms of PTS and depression .4 A systematic review of 649 6 studies (1 from India and 5 from China ), published in April 2020 ,26 support these 650 findings. Regarding mental wellbeing in healthcare workers, 33% reported flourishing, 651 58% reported moderate wellbeing , and 9% reported languishing mental health .27 652 Regarding mental health in other e ssential workers, a n online survey of various types of 653 essential workers conducted during the last four weeks of lockdown for COVID -19 in the 654 Hubei Province of China indicates that 25% reported moderate -to-severe anxiety 655 symptoms. Approximately 20% of farmers and economy staff reported moderate -to- 656 severe depressive symptoms , while only 15% of teachers/government staff did. 657 Approximately 12% of farmers and teachers/government staff reported moderate -to- 658 severe stress, while 17% of economy staff did.28 659 Before examining factors that influence the mental health of essential workers in Chapter 660 3 and interventions (often times addressing these factors) in Chapter 4, there are several 661 important caveats to note regarding the mental heal th outcomes available. Professor Sir 662 Simon Wessely and his colleagues note a number of areas of concern about the research 663 on mental health during the COVID -19 pandemic .29 Given data collection challenges 664 during the pandemic, our current knowledge of mental health in essential workers is 665 primarily limited to self -reported responses to surveys. As a result, t here is a high 666 potential for lack of representativeness, either due to low response rates, convenience 667 sampling, and/or because of potential response bias with respect to who completes a 668 survey (e.g., depending on the setting, it may be t hose most unwell , or least unwell if 669 stigma, social desirability, and/or lack of confidentiality are potential issues ). The 670 descriptive cross -sectional nature of the surveys means that little knowledge concerning 671 predictive factors of mental health issues is available, whic h implies a lack of targets for 672 interventions. Because these surveys on mental health are not longitudinal, evidence for 673 specific changes in mental health of essential workers compared to pre -pandemic levels 674 is lacking. Moreover, e xamining groups of essent ial workers in isolation inhibits our 675 understanding of whether the effect of the pandemic is different in essential workers 676 from the general population. Increases in symptom reporting could be confounded by 677 demographic differences such as gender and ethnic ity. Although evidence from some 678 countries suggests a decrease in mental health for the general population compared to 679 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 21 pre-pandemic levels (e.g., in the UK30), various lo ngitudinal population cohort studies in 680 the UK have found no increase in mental distress among healthcare workers.29 According 681 to early reports, F innish workers' menta l health has not decreased dramatically due to 682 the COVID -19 pandemic.31 683 A final limitation to take into account as research on sup porting mental health in 684 essential workers is examined relates to the mental health outcomes available. As 685 discussed in the previous chapter, both mental illness and mental wellbeing are 686 independent dimensions of mental health. High levels of both symptoms of mental illness 687 and wellbeing may co -exist, but most available research on mental health (both pre - 688 pandemic and during the pandemic ) neglects the mental wellbeing and functioning 689 dimension. Because mental health research , in general , tends to emphasize the mental 690 illness dimension, available survey tools do not sufficiently distinguish between mental 691 illness symptoms and impact on function. This distinction is important because d istress 692 can be considered a normal reaction to the COVID -19 pandemic, and certain responses 693 to stress can even be considered beneficial for effectively dealing with a threat (see 694 Walter Cannon's description the acute stress response, or fight -or-flight respo nse32). In 695 other words, knowing the percent of individuals with anxiety or depressive symptoms or 696 how they change as a result of an intervention may not refle ct how well these individuals 697 function. And it is the degre e of functional impairment that ultimately signals a need for 698 intervention. Little is known about the challenges that lead to functional impairment so 699 that they can be targeted for earlier intervention (primary and secondary prevention in 700 the framework), b efore care and treatment for those with ill mental health is required. In 701 order to prepare for future crises, there is a need to develop survey tools that better 702 distinguish mental illness from distress and measure the types of difficulties that need 703 intervention. 704 SARS -CoV-2 exposure and exposure -related concerns 705 The association between SARS -CoV-2 and mental health problems in healthcare workers 706 is well -established. An observational study from China reported that, compared to those 707 working in non -prevention and control positions, those working in isolation wards or fever 708 clinics and/or involved in pre -check triages reported worse depression symptoms, more 709 loneliness, and less social support .33 A systematic review supports these findings with 710 workers in areas with higher infection r ates reporting more severe levels of mental health 711 symptoms.34 Three r apid systematic reviews extend these findings. Exposure to patients 712 with COVID -19 was the most commonly reported correlate of depression, anxiety, and 713 stress in healthcare workers, with s pecific concerns about exposure associated with 714 mental health issues were worry about infection or about infecting others .35 36 A third 715 rapid review summarized exposure -related concerns associated with mental health as 716 involving close contact with COVID -19, lack of adequate personal protective equipment 717 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 22 (PPE) to prevent transmission of SARS -CoV-2, fear of infection , and concern about 718 family .37 719 SARS -CoV-2 exposure and exposure -related concerns also a ffect other essential workers, 720 although less is known about the risk/protective factors for mental health with respect to 721 other essential groups. Our review of the literature only identified data in this area 722 specific to tran sit workers . One poll indicates that one in four transit workers in New York 723 City suffered COVID -19.38 Results of an anonymous online survey of New York City 724 unionized transit workers conducted in August 202039 indicated that 60% felt \"nervous, 725 anxious, on -edge, and cannot control worrying\", 15% felt \"isolated, down , depressed or 726 hopeless\", and 10% had sleep problems. Over 90% knew someone at work who had 727 COIVD -19 and three fourths personally knew someone at work who had died. While 90% 728 of transit workers reported being concerned about getting sick at work , over 70% were 729 fearful for their safety at work due to : riders not wearing masks, riders getting angry 730 when asked to wear a mask, riders attacki ng them if asked to wear a mask, and/or riders 731 attacking them if they don't enforce mask use on other riders. 732 Burnout and Moral Injury: Risk factors for poor mental health in the health 733 workforce 734 The concept of post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been widely discussed in the 735 literature in regards to healthcare workers and the current Covid -19 pandemic.40-42 736 However, there are two other distinct but related conditions and deserve attention , those 737 of burnout and moral injury. All three conditions are associated with working in stressful 738 situations and have been recognized in multiple occupations. Studies that have sought to 739 measure the frequency of these conditions, usi ng standardized instruments, and have 740 described varying associations.43-45 For example, in a study among Greek firefighters, 741 20% of fire fighters reported burnout and 13% of those reported symptoms consistent 742 with PTSD.46 A study of health workers in New York found that those who had 743 experienced burnout in the previous year were twice as likely to experience PTSD during 744 the pandemic.47 745 Here we consider both burnout and moral injury, and their overlaps with PTSD in cause 746 and presentation . Management strategies for burnout and moral injury, along with other 747 risk and protective factors, will be addressed in Chapter 3. 748 Burnout 749 In a major health crisis, such as a pandemic, the workload of health workers inevitably 750 increases dramatically, potentially outstripping t he resources available, a problem that 751 may be compounded by illness and, in some cases, deaths, among those involved in the 752 response. In conditions such as these, there is an ever present risk of what is termed 753 burnout, a condition characterised by \"feelin gs of energy depletion or exhaustion; 754 increased mental distance from one's job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to 755 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 23 one's job; and reduced professional efficacy\".48 Burnout is also associated with a range of 756 subsequent adverse mental health outcomes, including Major Depressive Disorder .49 757 First described by Freudenberger in 1974, in a study of volunteers at a clinic for drug 758 addicts,50 burnout is not considered a medical condition, although it has been included in 759 the 11th revision of the International Classification of D iseases (code QD85) within the 760 section on \"factors influencing health status or contact with health services\", as a reason 761 why individuals might seek medical advice, but one that is primarily a consequence of 762 their occupational circumstances. While the early work focused on teachers and social 763 care workers,51 this soon extended to hea lthcare workers and, subsequently, more 764 generally. 765 Psychologists have developed a series of instruments that can be used to identify those 766 experiencing burnout. While having many features in common, some are based on 767 slightly different conceptions of the c ondition. The most widely used, the Maslach 768 Burnout Inventory (MBI),52 considers burnout to have three main elements, emotional 769 exhaustion, depersonalisation, whereby the affected individual distances themselves from 770 those they a re interacting with and regards them with cynicism, and a sense of reduced 771 personal accomplishment in their work. The Shirom -Melamed Burnout Measure53 also 772 emphasises exhaustion, both physical and emotional, but adds cognitive weariness or 773 fatigue, characterised by problems with memory and information processing. The 774 Oldenburg Burnout Inventory also includes exhausti on, but adds disengagement.54 There 775 is som e evidence that burnout can give rise to different symptoms in men and woman, 776 with higher levels of depersonalisation among the former and of emotional exhaustion 777 among the latter.55 778 There are also different responses to the conditions giving rise to burnout. Farber has 779 described three.56 The first, which he termed \"wear -out\" or brown -out\", describes the 780 situation where someone simply gives up in the face of excessive stress with inadequate 781 reward. The second, which he termed classic or frenetic burnout, was seen in individuals 782 who we re working ever harder to resolve their stressful situation or achieve a suitable 783 reward. Finally, there was under challenged burnout, where the stress level was low but 784 the work was especially unrewarding. 785 Burnout during the COVID -19 pandemic 786 Even at the best of times, health care workers are susceptible to burnout. Their work is 787 often intensive and emotionally challenging, dealing with patients and families facing 788 emotional trauma, with many struggling to respond with empathy in the face of 789 inadequate reso urces and other demands on their time. During the pandemic, they have 790 faced additional stressors. The pressure of markedly increased workload has been 791 accentuated by prolonged wearing of personal protective equipment, and with it the risks 792 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 24 of overheating a nd dehydration, as well as the effects of placing a physical barrier 793 between themselves and their patients.57 794 There have been many studies that have measured the prevalence of burnout during the 795 pandemic, mostly using the MBI. While most have found elevated rates of burnout, many 796 lack appropriate controls to assess how these figures relate to the pre -pandemic period. 797 Furthermore, c omparisons of health workers on the frontline of the COVID -19 response 798 and others have been conflicting. For example, a study of Italian healthcare profe ssionals 799 found that those who were directly involved in the management of patients with COVID - 800 19 had higher levels of burnout than those who were not.58 A study of health workers in 801 emergency departments, ambulance s, and intensive -care units in Turkey, reached the 802 same conclusion.59 In contrast, a study from Wuhan, China, reported a lower prevalence 803 of burnout among frontline health workers, an observation attributed to the higher value 804 placed on their work by the authorities.60 These findings were consistent with another 805 undertaken among Romanian medical students.61 The limited available evidence suggests 806 that some individuals may be at particular risk of burnout because of their personal 807 circumstances. In the aforementioned Turkish study, those who had children or family 808 members over the age of 65 with a chronic illness were at increased risk.59 Several 809 studies have found that women are especially at risk of burnout, in some cases linking 810 this to concerns about their families.62 Another study, which recruited health workers 811 globally via a variety of online platforms, found that perceived adequacy of PPE was 812 associated with a lower risk of burnout.63 A Japanese study found a higher risk of burnout 813 among health professionals who were not physicians compared with those who were64 814 but an Italian study found higher rate s of burnout in nurses than in doctors.65 A study 815 from Singapore found a higher frequency of burnout, measured by the OBI, among those 816 working longer hours and who had been redeployed away from their usual work setting.66 817 The implications of burnout 818 Research from prior to the pandemic emphasizes the consequences of b urnout for 819 health care workers. A systematic review of longitudinal studies found that burnout was a 820 predictor of adverse outcomes in three areas :67 (i) physical outcomes included type 2 821 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hospitalization due to cardiovascul ar disorder, 822 musculoskeletal pain, prolonged fatigue, headaches, severe injurie s and mortality at age 823 under 45; (ii) psychological consequences include insomnia, depressive symptoms, use 824 of psychotropic and antidepressant medications, and other mental dis orders. (iii) 825 occupational consequences include absenteeism, new disability pension, and 826 presenteeism. However, it also has implications for patients. There is an extensive body 827 of research, much based on studies on Magnet \u00ae hospitals68, which are hospitals that are 828 recognized for having created cultures that attract and retain nursing staff. These studies 829 have shown that lower levels of burnout among nurses are associated with better patient 830 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 25 outcomes, often mediated by a reduced level o f what is termed \"failure to rescue\", where 831 deterioration in a patient's condition is not detected or acted on.69,70 In the current 832 pandemic, it has been shown that mort ality is almost 20% higher in intensive care units 833 operating at the highest level of intensity.71 834 Moral injury 835 Although there is no consensus definition of the term moral injury, Shay conceptualises 836 moral injury as \"a character wound that stems from a betrayal of justice by a person of 837 authority in a high -stakes situation\" .72 Litz and colleagues (2009) define a potentially 838 morally injurious event (PMIE) as one that entail s \"perpetrating, failing to prevent, 839 bearing witness to, or learning about acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs and 840 expectations .\"73 Although mu ch of the initial research focu sed upon moral injury in 841 military per sonnel and veterans, a recent narrative review recognised many disciplines 842 that have researched moral injury , including psychiatry, social work, philosophy and 843 religious/spiritual74, as well as health care. 844 Moral injury is not a mental illness in itself, but those who develop moral injuries are 845 likely to experience negative thoughts about themselves and others .75 A systematic 846 review of occupational moral injury and mental health in 2018 recognised that these 847 symptoms can contribute to developing mental health issues such as depression, PTSD, 848 anxiety and even suicidal ideation .76 The impact of moral injury has been recognised 849 across a range of professions , including teachers, military service members, journalists , 850 and healthcare workers across a variety of countries .76 Moral injury has also been 851 recognised in medical students placed in pre -hospital and emergency settings when they 852 were exposed to unanti cipated trauma .77 853 An overlap between moral injury and PTSD has been acknowledged , for example, if the 854 index event that the individual was exposed to is both potentially life -threatening and 855 morally injurious .78 Litz and colleagues73 also indicate that PTSD and moral injury share 856 similar consequences with regards to re -experiencing the traumatic event and avoidance 857 or numbing. The indivi dual's role in the event can be victim or witness in both PTSD and 858 moral injury, and the role of perpetrator is a characteristic of moral injury only. PTSD and 859 moral injury are different with respect to the triggering event. In PTSD it is actual or 860 threate d death or serious injury, while in moral injury it is acts that violate deeply held 861 moral values. The necessity that is lost is different. In PTSD it is safety and in moral 862 injury it is trust. This leads to differences in the predominant painful emotion. PTSD 863 causes fear, horror, and/or helplessness, while moral injury causes guilt, shame, and 864 anger. Lastly, PTSD involves psychological arousal, while as moral injury does not. 865 The importance of following up junior staff after major incidents for PTSD has been 866 explored ;79 however major incidents (such as terrorist attacks, explosio ns or accidents 867 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 26 with high numbers of casualties over a short period) differ from pandemics in both 868 context and length of exposure to the potentially morally injurious event. 869 Moral Injury during the COVID -19 pandemic 870 Prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, t here was evidence of \"an existing baseline of 871 psychological pathology\" and low morale in healthcare workers ,80 even before moral 872 injury is considered. A 2017 systematic review of U K healthcare workers identified high 873 rates of psychiatric morbidity and burnout ( a syndrome traditionally conceptualised as 874 resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed, 875 characterised by feelings of energy depletion or exh austion; increased mental distance 876 from one's job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job; and reduced 877 professional efficacy )81,82, raising concerns about the negative impact on healthcare 878 provis ion discussed in the prior section.81 The difference betwe en burnout and moral 879 injury is important because using different terminology reframes the problems .83 880 Burnout traditionally suggests that the problem resides within the individual, who is in 881 some way deficient a nd lacks the resources or resilience to withstand the work 882 environment .83 Although the pandemic can be viewed as a natural disaster, the reactions 883 of those 'in legitimate authority' will be perceived by many, inc luding healthcare workers, 884 as 'a betrayal of what is right' .80 885 Furthermore, a lack of resources, inadequate clear guidance, or insufficient training may 886 also mean staff perceive that their own health is not being considered by their 887 employers.84 \"Anticipatory guilt\", seeing healthcare colleagues in other countries already 888 experiencing the adverse effects of the pandemic, has also been recognised.85 For those 889 healthcare workers that needed to quarantine, research identified feelings of guilt, pl us 890 fear they [healthcare workers] can contaminate their own families and conflict about 891 their roles.86,87 It remains unclear which staff will become very distressed during 892 quarantine, but the conditions of quarantine can make healthcare workers anxious to 893 return to work.80 The challenges described here, within the context of scarce specific 894 resources,84 and treatment decisions tha t may differ from when a disease is less 895 virulent80 can be argued as being analogous to the PMIEs initially proposed by Litz and 896 colleagues.73 897 In the current Covid -19 pandemic, potential risk factors for moral injury identified 898 include: 899 If there is loss of life to a vulnerable person 900 If leaders are perceived not to take responsibility for events/are unsupportive of staff 901 If staff feel unaware or unprepared for the emotional/psychological consequences of 902 decisions 903 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 27 If the PMIE occurs concurrently to exposure to other traumatic events (e.g. , death of 904 loved one) 905 If there is a lack of social support following the PMIE . 84 906 It should be noted that not all PMIEs lead onto individual healthcare staff experiencing 907 moral injury. Four different reactions to \"disaster\" have been identified88 that range from 908 \"not upset at all\" to \"mentally disordered\". Moreove r, the concept of 'post -traumatic 909 growth', with a bolstering of resilience, esteem, outlook and values, has also been 910 recognised .89 It is also important to note that many profound reactions of staff will be still 911 within what is considered a 'normal' reaction and will not constitute mental health 912 pathology .80 913 Implications of the identification of moral injury in the health workforce 914 However, for healthcare workers in the current pandemic, which is comparable with war 915 due to global death toll ,80 and with some now exposed to PMIEs for over a year without 916 pause, supporting the me ntal health of those who individuals who need it is a critical part 917 of the public health response .80 Although r esources have traditionally been put towards 918 supporting staff once they have developed mental health pathology, it has been 919 suggested that a shift in focus is required from indivi dual to organisation ,80 and 920 prevention and mitigation is more important than cure .90 921 Other risk and protective factors for mental health d uring the COVID -19 922 pandemic 923 Beyond fear of becoming infected, a rapid systematic review on the psychological impact 924 of COVID -19 and other viral epidemics on frontline healthcare workers emphasized risk 925 factors related to fear of the unknown, threats to their own mortality, stigma by society 926 and/or family members, and working long hours.91 Various systematic reviews identify 927 social support as a commonly reported protective factor for mental health in the health 928 workforce .36 91 Risk and protective factors associated with mental health in other 929 essential worker groups during the COVID -19 pandemic has not been sufficiently studied 930 to draw conclusions. 931 Risk and protective factors fo r mental health of essential workers in crisis 932 situations 933 For n on-healthcare and non -uniformed responders , parallels have been drawn between 934 the mental health response of essential workers to 9/11 and the mental health impact of 935 the COVID -19 pandemic.92 In particular, an 8 -year follow -up study found that non - 936 traditional 9/11 responders (e.g. , construction, clean -up, and asbestos workers; city 937 employees; and volunteers) had consistently higher rates of PTSD than uniformed 938 responders (e.g., police).93 Importantly, this group mostly lacked disaster response 939 experience and found themselves taking on tasks well outside the scope of their j obs, 940 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 28 often not by choice but due to economic necessity .92 It is possible to infer similar 941 consequences on mental health to other groups of non -healthcare essential workers who 942 were unprepared to cope with the consequences of the COVID -19 pandemic . 943 Impacts of pandemics on healthcare workers have alre ady been discussed in literature 944 prior to the current Covid -19 pandemic, within the context of previous infectious disease 945 outbreaks such as SARS.86,94 Increased workload, fears of contagion, working with new 946 and frequently changing protocols, barriers to usual commun ication and care with the 947 use of PPE, and caring for patients who quickly deteriorate were all recognised as 948 challenges. Furthermore, constant news coverage blurs the lines between home and 949 work.94 Kisely and colleagues conducted a rapid review and meta -analysis of the 950 psychological effects of emerging virus outbreaks on healthcare workers.95 Risk fac tors 951 for psychological distress included being younger, being more junior, being the parents of 952 dependent children, or having an infected family member. Longer quarantine, lack of 953 practical support, and stigma also contributed to psychological distress. Pr otective factors 954 for mental health included clear communication, access to adequate PPE, adequate rest, 955 and both practical and psychological support were associated. Table 2 provides a 956 summary of these risk and protective factors. 957 Table 2 Factors that increased or decreased risk of adverse psychological outcomes in 958 healthcare workers in emerging virus outbreaks prior to COVID -19 959 Factor Level Risk Factors Protective Factors Individual, clinical - Increased contact with infected patients - Precautionary measures creating perceived impediment to doing job - Forced re -deployment to look after affected patients - Higher risk among nurses + Frequent short breaks from clinical duties + Adequate time off work + Faith in precautionary me asures + Self -perception of being adequately trained and supported + Working in an administrative or managerial role Individual, training and experience - Inadequate training - Lower levels of education - Part-time employee - Less clinical experience + Greater experience through years worked Individual, personal - Increased time in quarantine - Staff with children at home - Personal lifestyle impact by epidemic/pandemic - Infected family member - Single or social isolation - Female sex - Lower household income - Comorbid physical health conditions - Younger age Individual, psychological - Lower perceived personal self-efficacy - History of psychological + Supportive peers + Family support Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 29 distress, mental health disorders, or substance misuse Service - Perceived lack of organisational support - Perceived lack of adequacy of training - Lack of confidence in infection control - No compensation by staff by organisation + Positive feedback to staff + Staff faith in service's infection control proce dures + Provision of protective gear +Effective staff training in preparation for outbreaks + Staff support protocols + Clear communication with staff + No infection among staff after start of strict protective measures + Infected colleagues getting better + Access to tailored psychological interventions based on needs of individual staff Societal - Social stigma against hospital workers + A general drop in disease transmission Source: Kisley, et al. (2020)95 960 Additional occupational health and economic risk factors influencing the mental 961 health of essential workers in general 962 An umbrella review on work -related st ress risk and preventive measures96 identified the 963 following groups of occupational risk factors that influence mental h ealth and deserve 964 attention when considering actions to support the mental health of essential workers : 965 - Role: Conflicts, violence, responsibility, role am biguity, sense of powerlessness 966 - Relationships : Colleagues' support, senior's support, subordinates (e.g. nurses), 967 communication, bullying 968 - Control : Limited control over the practice, dissatisfaction, lack of autonomy 969 - Factors intrinsic to the job : Workloads, shift work (night shifts in particular), 970 work time, medical errors, medico -legal concerns 971 - Organizational environment : Participation in decision making, inadequate 972 leisure time, excessive bureaucracy, absenteeism, reward system 973 - Career : Job security, career opportunities, promotion prospects/salar y, unpaid 974 overtime 975 Recessions 976 There is evidence suggesting that recessions are generally bad for mental health. A 977 systematic review on the effect of economic recessions on mental health outcomes 978 provides consistent evidence that economic recessions and me diators such as 979 unemployment, income decline, and unmanageable debts are significantly associated 980 with poor mental wellbeing , increased rates of common mental disorders, substance - 981 related disorders, and suicidal behaviours.97 The authors warn however that the research 982 is based on cross -sectional studies, which limits causality inferences. The Great 983 Recession in Europe and North America was associated with at least 10, 000 additional 984 economic suicides between 2008 and 2010.98 A literature review on the health 985 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 30 consequences of recessions in the US provides consistent evidence that recessions, and 986 unemployment in particular, can be significantly damaging to mental health, increa sing 987 the risk of substance abuse and suicide particularly for young men.99 The October 2008 988 stock market crash in the US increased feelings of depression and use of antidepressant 989 drugs, but did not lead to increases in clinically validated measures of depressive 990 symptoms or indicators of depression.100 A systematic review suggested that periods of 991 economic crisis might be linked to an increase of general help sought for mental health 992 problems, with conflicting results regarding the changes in the use of specialised 993 psychiatric care. It also suggests that economic crises might be associated with a higher 994 use of prescription drugs a nd an increase in hospital admissions for mental disorders.101 995 However, n ot all individuals are equally affected by economic crises or recessions, 996 illustrating the interplay between diffe rent types of factors occupational and non - 997 occupational factors . For example, t he prevalence of mental health problems in England 998 increased markedly since 2008, and such increases w ere greatest in people with less 999 education and people out of work.102 Gender differences have also been identified ; for 1000 instance, the 2008 recession in Spain was associated with an increase in pr evalence of 1001 people at risk of poor mental health in men, but with a reduction in women.103 1002 The role of pre -existing mental health conditions 1003 Mental hea lth conditions are common. Prior to the pandemic, the global lifetime 1004 prevalence for common psychological disorders was estimated to be 29.2%.104 Moreover, 1005 common mental health conditions \u2014 such as mood, anxiety and sub stance use 1006 disorders105 \u2014 have been found to be common among the working population,106 1007 particularly amongst healthcare workers.37 1008 People with mental health conditions have a lower life expectancy and generally poorer 1009 health outcomes than those with no psychological conditions, due to a complex 1010 combination of socioeconomic and behavioural risk factors, often accentuated by barriers 1011 to accessing care.107 In many countries, the COVID -19 pandemic has led to a significant 1012 disruption of mental health services,108 while non -pharmaceutical interventions to control 1013 the pandemic, such as quarantine and physical distancing, while necessary to interrupt 1014 transmission of infection, pose risks to both physical and mental health .109,110 Taken 1015 together, these considerations have given rise to concerns that the current pandemic 1016 could cause relapse or exacerbation of existi ng psychiatric conditions.111 However, the 1017 full impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the mental health of those with a history of 1018 mental ill -health is still not fully understood, including amongst essential workers. 1019 Impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on those with pre -existing mental health 1020 disorders 1021 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 31 People with pre -existing mental health problems were recognised early on in the 1022 pandemic as a group likely to be disproportionately affected by the it and the control 1023 measures associated with i t.111 Therefore, they were considered to be particularly 1024 vulnerable to adverse mental health outcomes.112 Evidence from previous novel viral 1025 outbreaks found that pre -existing psycho logical ill -health was associated with worse 1026 psychological outcomes.95 However, research on the impact of the current COVID -19 1027 pandemic on this grou p has produced mixed results. 1028 Certain mental health conditions \u2014 such as anxiety -related disorders \u2014 may be 1029 especially at risk of being aggravated by the pandemic.113 A recent systematic review and 1030 meta-analysis showed that people with pre -existing mental health conditions experienced 1031 clinically and statistically significantly higher rates of psychiatric symptoms (including 1032 anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia) during pandemics compared to those in control 1033 groups.114 However, not ing inadequacies in the designs of many of the studies included in 1034 the review, the authors urge caution in attributing these outcomes to the pandemic (as 1035 opposed to selection bias due to the nature of sampling, often involving those in contact 1036 with health services). The authors recommend improved research methodologies \u2014 1037 particularly the need for longitudinal studies where data were available on pre -pandemic 1038 psychiatric morbidity and symptom severity \u2014 in order to allow for causal associations to 1039 be made. T he review findings support the urgent need for accessible mental health 1040 services to address the high levels of psychiatric symptoms experienced by people with 1041 pre-existing mental illnesses during this \u2014 and likely future \u2014 pandemics. 1042 A recently published longitudinal study of three existing Dutch cohorts (not included in 1043 the aforementioned systematic review) confirmed that the symptom severity of people 1044 with depressive, anxiety or obsessive -compulsive disorder was systematically higher than 1045 in individuals without mental health disorders, but found that pre -existing mental ill - 1046 health did not necessarily predispose to a greater level of emotional reactivity to the 1047 pandemic.115 The authors acknowledge, however, that data were only collected during 1048 the first month of the national lockdown in the Netherlands and, therefore, may not 1049 necessarily capture the longer -term effect of the pandemic on those with pre -existing 1050 mental health conditions. Based on these results, the authors highlight the importance of 1051 maintaining access to mental health services during the pandemic and the pr essing need 1052 for further research to understand the longer -term impact of the pandemic on mental 1053 health. 1054 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 32 1.3. What interventions could be effective in addressing mental health 1055 support needs of health workers and other essential workers, 1056 including those with pre -existing mental health conditions? 1057 For the purposes of addressing th is mandate question, we conducted a search in PUBMED 1058 and Cochrane Library for systematic reviews, reviews of reviews, meta -analysis, 1059 effectiveness, or cost -effectiveness publications considering interventions for mental 1060 health in health workforce and/or other essential workers as defined in the mandate. 1061 Specific interventions targeting burnout and moral injury we re included in the search . 1062 The focus of this chapter is on interventions that have demonstrated effectiveness in the 1063 context of the COVID -19 pandemic or past outbreaks. When necessary in order to fill 1064 gaps in the available research, literature from pre -pandemic studies is described. 1065 Limitations and challenges associated with the research concerning the effectiveness of 1066 interventions to support the mental health of essential workers include the following 1067 issues: 1068 1. Our understanding of mental health (based on the two -dimensional model of 1069 mental illness and mental wellbeing ) and its aetiology is poor. The use of a 1070 biomedical model of health can be unhelpful for mental health research. 1071 2. Mental health is very broad on i ts scope. The problems studied are very different, 1072 ranging from (symptoms of) depression, anxiety or insomnia to OCD, suicide 1073 ideation, PTSD, addictions, or chronic conditions such as schizophrenia or bipolar 1074 disorder. Interventions to support the mental wellbeing dimension are 1075 understudied. 1076 3. Measuring mental health outcomes is extremely challenging. They are often 1077 poorly defined and subjective. Mental illness often has a chronic course and 1078 individuals frequently meet the diagnostic criteria for more than o ne mental health 1079 problem so it is difficult to separate out one problem from another. 1080 4. Interventions to address mental health do not always lead themselves to well to 1081 being studied using traditional randomized controlled trial designs. Talking 1082 therapies and similar interventions are complex and context -dependent. They are 1083 often tailored to the individual and have components, such as the relationship 1084 with the therapist, which can be difficult to standardise. 1085 5. Our understanding of mechanisms by which intervent ion work is rudimentary. 1086 Interventions to influence mental health are often complex and multi -component, 1087 which means it can be challenging to separate out effects of particular 1088 components or determine the \"active ingredient\" of a given intervention. 1089 Furthe rmore, components often interact with other factors. 1090 6. Many interventions to support mental health show promising results in the short 1091 run, while the intervention is on -going, but impact may disappear in the long run. 1092 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 33 7. When examining systematic reviews of int erventions to support mental health, t he 1093 definition s of effectiveness can be vague and very from study to study. Moreover, 1094 similar m ental health concepts can be assessed using many different scales, which 1095 can make comparison of effectiveness of interventio ns across studies difficult. 1096 8. Many of the few economic evaluations on worksite mental health interventions 1097 lack methodological quality or lack evidence to support evidence -based decision 1098 making. 1099 9. It is important to keep in mind that achieving the best outco mes depends upon 1100 providing the right type of intervention to the correct population at the right time. 1101 One size might not fit all and direct programmes to the ones most at risk might 1102 increase the cost -effectiveness of promising interventions. 1103 The result of these caveats is that research on effectiveness of mental health 1104 interventions is generally poor. However, results are promising. 1105 In order to support the mental health of essential workers, the workplace itself becomes 1106 an important context for the impleme ntation of appropriate interventions. Referring to 1107 the conceptual framework for the Opinion and the Swiss Cheese model for supporting 1108 mental health in essential workers, these i ntervention s can occur on various levels - 1109 there are policy -level (e.g., economic and social), organisational, task -job, and individual 1110 orientations. Interventions are also classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary 1111 prevention. As shown in the conceptual framework, primary interventions are proactive 1112 by nature . Primary prevention prevent s exposure to a known risk factor and keeps 1113 harmful effects from emerging . Primary prevention may also enhance an individual's 1114 tolerance or resilience in order to manage or cope more effectively with a stressor . 1115 Secondary prevention efforts happen before mental health causes a detrimental impact 1116 on function. Secondary interventions reverse, reduce or slow the progression of ill -health 1117 and preclinical conditions or to increase individual resources. Such secondary approaches 1118 may include both early detection and early treatment , with the aim of reducing the 1119 severity or duration of symptoms and /or to halt or slow the further development of more 1120 serious and potentially disabling conditions. Lastly, tertiary interventions are 1121 rehabilitative by nature . They reduc e negative impacts and heal existing damages. 1122 Tertiary prevention efforts aim to treat and manage a diagnosed condition and minimize 1123 its impact on daily functioning . Examples of tertiary interventi ons include rehabilitation, 1124 relapse prevention, providing access to resources and support, and promoting 1125 reintegration in the workforce. 1126 The EU -Compass for Action on Mental Health and Wellbeing116 has identified some 1127 additional limitations concerning interventions in the workplace to support mental health. 1128 First, intervention studies primarily address individual outcomes. However, multi-modal 1129 approaches, and especially mea sures implemented at organisational level , are important . 1130 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 34 These types of studies must be promoted and evaluated. Evaluation should include both 1131 process and outcome aspects, in order to capture effects that might otherwise go 1132 unnoticed. Emphasis on primary prevention is warranted that address es risk factors in 1133 the work environment and integrates individual s affected by mental ill health in the 1134 workforce by providing appropriate support. Second, there is a lack of studies in small 1135 and medi um-sized enterprises (SMEs) . This is concerning because SMEs are widely 1136 acknowledged to be in need of appropriate support in terms of awareness and action 1137 implementation when it comes to mental health in the workplace. EU-level efforts should 1138 assist them i n risk assessment and implementation of good practices where available . 1139 Third, much current knowledge focuses on mental ill health and negative impacts , with 1140 comparatively less evidence on the impact of positive psychological wellbeing in a healthy 1141 work en vironment. Further research is needed that expand s the range of factors and 1142 outcomes examined to include wellbeing , flourishing, vitality and sustainability. 1143 Potentially effective interventions to protect mental health of essential workers should 1144 therefore be complex and multi -faceted, address ing modifiable risk factors identified in 1145 the prior chapter of this Opinion, and be implemented on multiple levels. 1146 Interventions in mental health of essential workers 1147 Our literature search resulted in effectiveness research of interventions to support the 1148 mental health of the health workforce during the COVID -19 pandemic or in the context of 1149 previous emerging disease outbreaks (e.g., SARS, Ebola, MERS). Most of these studies 1150 are pre -dominantly concerned with hospital settings, with a lack of evidence related to 1151 social care staff or primary care staff. This is concerning because of the large proportion 1152 of deaths occurring in the community and specifically in residential care homes. 1153 Moreover, t here is an important gap i n research regarding interventions to support the 1154 mental health of other groups of non-healthcare essential workers during emerging 1155 disease outbreaks . These gaps must be rectified in the future as well. 1156 Mental health i nterventions in essential, primary healthcare , workers 1157 A rapid systematic review examining the mental health impact of the COVID -19 1158 pandemic on healthcare workers and interventions to support psychological wellbeing 1159 highlights the poor study design of most studies, reflecting the urgency of the pandemic, 1160 and therefore a need to incorporate high -quality research in p andemic preparedness 1161 planning.37 Similarly, a Cochrane mixed methods systematic review evaluating 1162 interventions to support the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social 1163 care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemics that 1164 included COVID -19 identified 16 studies. The se studies mainly looked at workplace 1165 interventions that involved either psychological support or work -based interventions. No 1166 evidence regarding how well different strategies work ed to support the resilience and 1167 mental wellbeing of frontline workers was found .117 However, other reviews do suggest 1168 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 35 that some interventions are effective in supporting the mental health of the health force 1169 and other essential workers. Furthermore, it may be possible to transfer interventions 1170 with proven effectiveness in different populations or in different contexts to essential 1171 workers in the COVID -19 pandemi c. 1172 Effectiveness of individual -level interventions 1173 A rapid review of stress reduction techniques i n health care providers dealing with severe 1174 coronavirus infect ions (SARS, MERS, and COVID -19)118 provides preliminary support for 1175 the value of Cognitive -Behavioral Therapy (CBT) interventions for crisis intervention .95 1176 Specifically, basic CBT skills may be effective in treating the anxiety and depression in 1177 the health workforce when paired with Psychological First Aid (PFA) principles.119 95 1178 Psychological First Aid (PFA) is recommended for use in serious crisis events by the 1179 WHO120 and includes the management of basic safety needs (for example, food and 1180 water, information); practical care and support; empathic listening; increas ing social 1181 support; providing mental health support and referrals as needed; and protection from 1182 further harm.121 Focusing on values clarification may help essential workers feel a 1183 renewed sense of purpose and meaning in their careers and with their families during a 1184 crisis like COVID -19.119 Therefore, evidence suggests that workplaces should first focus 1185 on meeting the client's bas ic needs, including safety, eating, and sleeping modifications 1186 where possible, while incorporating warmth, empathic listening, and validation. 1187 Of note, systematic reviews published prior to the COVID -19 pandemic provide some 1188 additional evidence for the eff ectiveness of individual -level intervention to support the 1189 mental health of the health workforce . A 2015 Cochrane review122 examining the 1190 prevention of occupational stress in healthcare workers concluded that CBT training , as 1191 well as mental and physical relaxation , all reduce stress moderate ly. In another 1192 systematic review of interventions to improve the psychological wellbe ing of general 1193 practitioners, four studies reported statistically significant improvement in self -reported 1194 mental ill -health. Two interventions used CBT, one was mindfulness -based, and one fed - 1195 back General Health Questionnaire scores and self -help information .123 Lastly, arts -based 1196 intervention may be a promising individual -level intervention to support the mental 1197 health of essential workers. Arts-based intervention includes music, movement, creative 1198 arts classes, participatory arts classes, arts a ctivities, visual arts, art appreciation 1199 classes, collages and drawing classes, poetry therapy, and stories and diary writing work. 1200 A number of individual studies demonstrate the effectiveness of arts -based interventions 1201 to support the mental health of hea lthcare workers and its effectiveness in health and 1202 social care settings .124 1203 Regarding the general population of workers, a systematic review on interventions for 1204 common mental disorders in the occupational health service prior to the COVID -19 1205 pandemic suggests that only a few studies provide evidence for e ffective prevention 1206 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 36 among employees at risk.125 Yet, a systematic review and meta -analysis of web -based 1207 psychological interventions delivered in the workplace indicates that occupational digital 1208 mental health interventions can improve workers' psychological wellbeing and increase 1209 work effectiveness.126 Greater engagement and adherence was associated with 1210 interventions that are delivered over a shorter time frame (6 to 7 weeks), utilize 1211 secondary modalities for delivering the interventions and engaging users [i.e., emails and 1212 text messages (short message service, SMS), and use elements of persuasive technology 1213 (i.e., self -monitoring and tailoring). 1214 One promising individual -level digital intervention is Text4Hope, a daily s upportive SMS 1215 text messaging program . Text4Hope was launched in Canada to mitigate the negative 1216 mental health impacts of the pandemic among the general population . It is a free service 1217 providing three months of daily CBT -based text messages written by ment al health 1218 therapists. Through a set of daily messages, people receive advice and encouragement 1219 helpful in developing healthy personal coping skills and resiliency. Text4Hope was 1220 determined to be a convenient, cost -effective, and accessible means of impleme nting a 1221 population -level psychological intervention. This service demonstrated significant 1222 reductions in anxiety and stress levels during the COVID -19 pandemic and could 1223 potentially be transferred to targeted use for workplace mental health .127 1224 Effectiveness of workplace - and societal -level interventions 1225 In broad terms , effective interventions involve increasing social and societal support and 1226 numerous workplace interventions, from communication and training to infection control, 1227 to workload management, and offering personal support.95 1228 Indeed, according to the data collected by the COVID -19 Health Systems Response 1229 Monitor128, during COVID -19 pandemic (even as early as April 2020 in some countries) 1230 most E uropean countries took action to enable mental health and wellbeing of healthcare 1231 workers that included particular workplace provisions, e.g. supply ing PPE , as well as 1232 assuring rest and limiting working time periods. Recent analysis by EuroHealthNet129 1233 confirm s that the predominant initiatives involve d direct mental health interventions and 1234 financial support, sometimes taking the form of free transportation, accommodation 1235 and/or childcare. Countries in which healthcare workers earn relatively low wages paid 1236 particular attention to financial compensation for work performed. Direct mental health 1237 interventions mostly comprised of newly established helplines and remote consultations 1238 from trained professionals. Although the effectiveness of these particular interventions to 1239 support the mental health of essen tial workers is unknown, the use of helplines and 1240 remote consultations is in line with an exploratory study of Chinese healthcare workers in 1241 which 30% indicated they wanted to receive one -on-one psychological counselling and 1242 24% wanted crisis management in tervention.33 1243 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 37 Based on experiences from emerging virus outbreaks prior to COVID -19, one rapid 1244 review and meta -analysis clearly indicates that most effective interventions to support 1245 the mental health of the health workforce are workplace -level interventions. Specifically, 1246 these interventions occur within the organisation by senior management and managerial 1247 staff addressing team and organisational factors such as communicati on and training, 1248 infection control, employee workload, psychological support for employees, and personal 1249 support for employees.95 Table 3 lists specific recommendations to support the mental 1250 health of healthcare workers. A 2015 Cochrane review 122 examining the prevention of 1251 occupational stress in healthcare workers also concluded that changing work schedules 1252 was effective to reduce stress. 1253 Table 3 Recommendations to deal with psychological problems in healthcare workers in 1254 emerging virus outbreaks prior to COVID -19 1255 Level Recommendations to deal with psychological problems Individual * Staff \"buddy\" system to support personal precautionary measures * Encouragement among peers * Sufficient rest and time off * Opportunities for reflection on the effects of stress * Increased support from family and friends Service, communication and training * Clear communication with staff * Training and education around infectious diseases Service, infection control * Clear direction and enforcement of infection control procedures * Screening stations to direct patients to relevant infection treatment clinics * Sufficient supplies of adequate PPE * Re-designing nursing care procedures that pose high risks for spread of infec tions * Improving safety, such as better ventilation systems or constructing or negative pressure rooms to isolate patients * Reducing the density of patients on wards Service, workload * Appropriate work shifts and regular breaks * Avoidance of compulsor y assignment to caring for patients with COVID -19 * Re-arranging hospital infrastructure, such as re -deployment of wards and human resources * Available of hospital security to help deal with uncooperative patients Service, personal support * Guaranteed food and daily living supplies * Alternate accommodation for staff who are concerned about infecting their families * Video facilities for staff to keep in contact with families and alleviate their concerns Service, psychological * Recognition of staff efforts * Training to detail with identification of and responses to psychological problems * Minimising time in quarantine * Access to psychological interventions Societal * Minimisation of stigma and discrimination * Attention to media portrayal of heal thcare workers Source: Kis ely, et al. (2020)95 1256 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 38 According to the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2009 public 1257 health guideline on Mental Wellbeing at Work130 (currently under revision as of 2018 ), 1258 the following recommendations were made: 1) Employers should take a st rategic and 1259 coordinated approach to promoting employees' mental wellbeing; 2) Employers should 1260 assess opportunities for promoting employees' mental wellbeing and managing risks; 3) 1261 Employers should provide opportunities for flexible working; 4) Employers s hould 1262 strengthen the role of line managers in promoting the mental wellbeing of employees 1263 through supportive leadership style and management practices; 5) National policies 1264 should support micro, small and medium -sized businesses in helping them implement 1265 organisation -wide approaches to promoting mental wellbeing. 1266 In terms of operationalizing the NICE guidelines on Mental Wellbeing at Work, the EU 1267 Joint Action CHRODIS (2014 -2016) and CHRODIS+ (2017 -2020) was funded to carry out 1268 17 policy dialogues and implem ent 21 projects to improve actions for combatting chronic 1269 diseases. The outcomes of the CHRODIS+ area \"Employment and Chronic Diseases\" are 1270 particularly relevant to supporting the mental health of essential workers. Specifically, a 1271 Toolkit for Workplaces c reated as part of Work Package 8 synthesizes best practices 1272 related to Fostering Employees' Wellbeing , Health, and Work Participation.131 The Toolkit 1273 facilitates identifying workplace strengths. The appendix contains a checklist to assess 1274 what approa ches and means are currently in use in an organization and map -analy se- 1275 plan guide to tailor a program intervention. Within each domain, the toolkit describes 1276 ideas for concrete actions to (1) strengthen knowledge and skills, (2) create supporting 1277 working e nvironment (physical, social, and digital environments are addressed), (3) 1278 adopt wellbeing -fostering policies, and (4) incentivize. Of the seven domains covered in 1279 the Toolkit, implementation of practices related to (i) Mental health and wellbeing, (ii) 1280 Recovery from work, and (iii) Community spirit and atmosphere are acknowledged as 1281 useful to help support the mental health of essential workers. 1282 Effectiveness of coordinated and/or integrated a pproaches 1283 Integrated protective approaches provided by senior management, for instance, are 1284 recommended to safeguard the mental health of healthcare workers over the use of 1285 separate mental health intervention strategies. Niels de Brier and colleagues (2020)132 1286 conducted a rapid systematic review and recommend : 1287 Giving a sense of support by the organization; 1288 Providing opportunities to talk, listen to concerns and offer empathic support; 1289 Protecting physical safety; 1290 Reducing the impact of changing job demands; 1291 Maximizing healthcare workers' sense of control; 1292 Receiving continuous support from supervisors and colleagues in case of 1293 quarantine; 1294 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 39 Providing additional attention to those in especially high -risk occupations; 1295 Ensuring formal training and training in supportive and resilience skill 1296 development . 1297 Magill and colleagues (2020)133 also conducted a rapid review of the literature that 1298 supports systems -level interventions like those described above because that are likely to 1299 alleviate distress for most healthcare workers as primary or secondary prevention 1300 measures, and thereby avoi ding use of tertiary prevention activities such as specialized 1301 psychotherapeutic support and/or referral to specialty care. These systems -level 1302 interventions should be made readily available to healthcare workers, and extended to 1303 other essential workers an d non -essential workers, during and beyond the COVID -19 1304 pandemic. 1305 Major and Hlubocky (2021)134 conducted a rapid review and argue d for a comprehensive 1306 psychosocial support model with individual - and organization -level interventions to 1307 mitigate adverse mental health outcomes among healthcare workers. They reference a 1308 number of e vidence -based frameworks in the recently published literature, including 1309 Psychological First Aid (PFA) , Stress Continuum Model and Stress First Aid, Personal 1310 Resilience Training, Organiz ational Resilience and Organizational Justice, Cognitive 1311 Behavioural Therapy , and M indfulness. The authors encourage integration of strategies 1312 and frameworks in into larger organizational mental health frameworks. A national -level 1313 comprehensive approach to mental health of healthcare workers may offer a possible 1314 solution. The draft of Australian framework \"Every Doctor, Every Setting\"135 is an 1315 example of a national -level effort aiming to coordinated action to prevent mental ill - 1316 health and suicidal behaviour and support good mental health for all doctors and medical 1317 students through 5 action pillars : primary, secondary, and tertiary preventi on, mental 1318 health promotion and leadership. 1319 Coordinated and/or integrated approaches to manage burnout 1320 Effectiveness of coordinated and/or integrated approaches is particularly evidenced in the 1321 management of burnout. There is widespread agreement that burnout should be viewed 1322 primarily as an organisational problem rather than an individual one. Although there is a 1323 temptation to medicalise the problems faced by affected individuals, the evidence in 1324 favour of individualised interventions is limited, even though there is some evidence of 1325 overlap between the symptoms of workers experiencing burnout and other patients with 1326 clinical depression,136,137 especially so for those with marked symptoms of exhaustion. 1327 However, while the manifestations may be similar, burnout has a specific aet iology 1328 arising from the work environment. In other words, an appropriate response should focus 1329 of working conditions rather than on the individual affected. 1330 Given these considerations, there is broad consensus that the most appropriate 1331 measures to prevent burnout from arising combine organisational change with support 1332 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 40 for the individual affected. Maslach and Leiter have argued that burnout is most likely 1333 where there is a disconnection between the organisation and the individual in six areas of 1334 their workin g life, workload, control, reward, community, fairness, and values.138 1335 Consequently, an effective respons e will involve a comprehensive approach to all of 1336 these, involving changes in the individual and the organisation. A systematic review and 1337 meta-analysis, which examined 20 independent comparisons from 19 studies, found that 1338 while there was evidence that bo th organisational and individual interventions were 1339 effective, the effect size was significantly greater for the former.139 1340 A first step is to ensure that the individual concerned has adequate resources to meet the 1341 demands placed upon them. It is also import ant for the individual to be able to see that 1342 the organisation has values that recognise their contribution to it, for example by 1343 emphasising the importance of supportive leadership and relationships with colleagues.138 1344 It is particularly important to address perceived unfairness, with one study finding 1345 decreased exhaustion, although not improvements in deper sonalisation, following the 1346 implementation of weekly meetings to examine and resolve perceived inequities in the 1347 working environment.140 1348 The evidence on the effectiveness of interventions targeted at the individual are less 1349 encouraging, at least when adopted without corresponding changes in the working 1350 environment, although in part this is because the studies that have been conducted are 1351 often small or evaluate outcomes over a short time frame. For example, a trial of an 1352 intervention to teach physicians about the psychology of burnout, stress, coping with 1353 patient death, and managing dist ress did find a reduction in symptoms of burnout but 1354 this was only measured at seven days post -intervention.141 Other studies have focused 1355 on general stress relieving measures, such as yoga,142 exercise, and training in stress 1356 management. Others have involved cognitive behavioural therapy and relaxation 1357 techniques, a lthough a Cochrane review found only low quality evidence supporting the 1358 use of cognitive behavioural therapy, mental or physical relaxation, or changing work 1359 schedules.143 1360 In reality, changes to the organisation of the workplace that would be desirable in normal 1361 circumstances will be extremely difficult during a pandemic. Consequently, it is necessary 1362 to look for other measures that might be able to mitigate the consequences of the 1363 conditions that give rise to burnout. Although evidence of effectiveness is limited, one 1364 group of authors h as advocated what they term \"micro -practices\", activities that require 1365 minimal time to learn and implement. Examples include taking a minute to reflect on 1366 one's wellbeing , including hunger and hydration, while using hand sanitiser.144 Another 1367 has suggested a series of practical measures that encapsulate established best practice 1368 in creating a work environment conducive to supporting the mental health of the health 1369 workforce,145 and can be extended to other essential and non -essential workers. 1370 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 41 Box 1 Best practice in cre ating a work environment conducive to supporting the mental 1371 health of the health workforce 1372 Provide clear messages that clinicians are valued and that managing th e pandemic 1373 together is the goal. 1374 Provide work schedules that promote physical resilience, enabling adequate sleep 1375 with access to rooms for those working long or multiple shifts, easy access to 1376 water, healthy snacks, chargers for phones and other devices, and toiletries, and 1377 designated times for clinicians to take br eaks, ea t, and take medications. 1378 Reduce noncritical work activities, such as eliminating no n-essential 1379 administrative tasks. 1380 Provide a central source for updated information and clear communication of well - 1381 defined protocols, expectations, and such resources as chi ldcare via e -mails, 1382 tweets, and automated calls. 1383 Encourage clinicians to openly discuss vulnerability and the importance of 1384 protecting one's emotional strength. 1385 Foster spiritual resilience through distribution of positive messaging that 1386 emphasizes apprecia tion for clinicians' dedication and altruism, including sharing 1387 stories of success, rather than fo cusing on failures and stresses. 1388 Develop an evidence -based menu of interventions tailored to diverse workplace 1389 settings, including wellness committees and emp loyee assistance programs, 1390 informed by surveys to assess stress points, fears, and concerns. 1391 Source: Dewey et al, 2020145 1392 Coordinated and/or integrated approaches to support mental health 1393 Numerous of coordinated an d/or integrated strategies were initially developed to address 1394 moral injury and derived from research within the military and with veterans. However, 1395 the findings can potentially be applied to both healthcare and allied settings, and 1396 extended to other esse ntial workers and non -essential workers as well. It has been 1397 proposed that strategies to address moral injury can be divided into before, during, and 1398 after the crisis .75 1399 Before 1400 Military research has recognised that preparing staff for the j ob and associated 1401 challenges reduces the risk of mental health problems .146 In the healthcare setting, 1402 workers \"should not be given false reassurances, but a full and frank assessment of what 1403 they will face .\"75 It has also been suggested that organisations should \"immediately 1404 reflect on the challenges the staff faced at baseline\" , such as shift -working and workload, 1405 that can all impact on wellbeing .80 1406 During 1407 Individuals benefit from tangible and practical support .94 Durin g a crisis, organisations 1408 can support staff in a range of practical ways, as summarised in Box 2 . Psychological 1409 support should be offered to all staff in quarantine ,80 and drop -in psychological support , 1410 an effective intervention recognised in previous outbreaks ,147 provided for those working. 1411 However, the availability of support will vary and is likely to be scarce .80 Remote 1412 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 42 psychological support mechanisms need to be considered in the context of pandemics, 1413 via digital platforms available .80 While peer support has its place, off -loading to a relative 1414 stranger can also be useful to st aff.80 Routine support available t o staff should include a 1415 briefing on moral injuries, as well as an awareness of other causes of mental ill health 1416 and what to look out for .75 1417 Table 4 Proposed ways that organisations can support the mental health of workers 1418 during a pandemic 1419 Providing food, drink and rest facilities Ensuring staff do not exceed safe hours by encouraging reporting and monitoring of hours, and preparing reinforcements so staff can take annual leave and breaks Focusing on dynamic workload management and clear role expectations Proactively addressing resource inequities across the organisation Proactively resolving housing or transport issues for staff to reduce anxiety of infecting family members and safely travelling to and from w ork Regular situational updates for all staff, including realistic and frank information about risk and adverse events, e.g. report of death among colleagues or advising staff to write a will Regular praise for staff and acknowledgement of the unprecedente d and exceptional circumstances Being visible on the ground throughout the pandemic (managers, senior staff) Clear messaging, rationale and guidance for changing standards of practice Encouraging a two -way dialogue and being open to suggestions and ideas f rom staff Facilitating debriefs and morale building communal time Designing rotas so that teams can stay together (despite migrating through changing shift times) throughout the pandemic Being clear that staff safety is the number one priority Providing ad equate PPE and identifying/removing high -risk staff from frontline work to reduce anxiety for becoming infected Providing education on the normal responses to extreme stress to reassure staff Educating team leaders on debriefing practices and the needs of individuals Providing formal and informal psychological support Ensuring staff in quarantine are regularly supported and communicated with during and after their isolation Planning specifically for supporting teams if colleagues are critically ill or decea sed Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 43 Ensuring there is appropriate support for different staff grades and disciplines, e.g. doctors and nurses, as well as porters and cleaning staff Keeping up to date with evolving guidance on supporting staff and recommendations Source: Walton et al., 202080 1420 The role o f leadership, in its visibility, humanity and flexibility during a crisis, is crucial - 1421 maintaining honesty in communication whilst remaining calm, and empowering 1422 individuals within teams to become their own leaders .80 It is also important to recognise 1423 that the prolonged nature of the pa ndemic, and the likelihood of ongoing high levels of 1424 absenteeism for both physical and psychological reasons, means the \"baton of leadership 1425 will need to be passed between people during the marathon .\"80 More senior managers 1426 should keep an active eye on more junior ones and check how they a re doing .75 1427 Colleagues can support each other spotting early signs of concerns in themselves and 1428 others, offering colleagues the opportunity to talk, signposting to psychological services, 1429 being kind to each other and encouraging self -care; those co -ordinating psychological 1430 support in departments should offer debrief/supervision sessions for peer supporters .80 1431 After 1432 Formal psychological support for those in front -line roles affected by Covid -19 should be 1433 prioritised and readily accessible, as lengthy waits for treatment are recognised as a 1434 reason why people to do seek it .84 Of note, individuals with moral injury related mental 1435 health disorders are often reticent to speak about guilt or shame, and may focus on 1436 classically traumatic elements ;84 any psychological screening needs to be mindful of this 1437 presentation . 'Active monitoring', as defined in guidance for PTSD, is also advised 148. 1438 Specific ongoing psychological interventions proposed in the context of moral injury 1439 include Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) to reduce trauma related guilt, Acceptance 1440 and Commitment Therapy (ACT), aimed to promote non -judgemental acceptance of 1441 internal experiences, and Adaptive Disclosure (AD), targeting recognised mechani sms of 1442 moral repair .74 One-off psychological debriefs are felt to be unhelpful in moral injury, as 1443 are som e standardised treatment for PTSD such as Prolonged Exposure .84,149 1444 Safe multidisciplinary spaces to discuss clinical cases and reflect upon their impact, such 1445 as Schwarz rounds, are also cited as another mechanism to for healthcare workers to 1446 discuss difficult emotional and social issues arising from patient care.150,151 1447 Shay reminds us that \"trust i s on the table\", with the question \"why should I trust you?\" 1448 asked verbally and behaviourally a thousand times with every morally injured veteran .72 1449 Questions asked by the veteran aim to establish whether the clinician is another 1450 perpetrator , a victim , a self -serving bystander or a rescuer -once the veteran recognises 1451 the clinician as a freely co -operating partner , then the recovery is well advanced .72 1452 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 44 Interventions to addr ess the mental health needs of essential workers with pre - 1453 existing mental health conditions 1454 Consistent with the gaps in knowledge of the impact of the pandemic on those with pre - 1455 existing mental health conditions in the essential worker population, there i s a lack of 1456 robust evidence for the effectiveness of interventions designed to address the mental 1457 health needs of this group who may be at particular risk. 1458 A rapid review of the evidence for mental health interventions during COVID -19 and 1459 other pandemics f ound that whilst research on effectiveness of interventions was 1460 growing, few studies distinguished between new mental health problems triggered by 1461 medical pandemics and those that were pre-existing .152 The review highlighted two 1462 studies related to the 2003 SARS outbreak, which suggested that training healthcare 1463 workers in resilience may be particularly effective for those with a history of mental ill - 1464 health. Whilst not specific to groups of essential workers or those with pre -existing 1465 mental health conditions, the paper recomme nds timely interventions for those 1466 experiencing mental ill -health that can be sustained (an opinion shared by other studies 1467 exploring mental health in biological disasters153). Moreover, the authors advocate for the 1468 provision of a wide range of mental health support services that can meet the diverse 1469 needs of groups with different vulnerabilities and risks (a recommendation common to 1470 other papers on this subject 111,113). 1471 An article on early interventions to support hospital staff during COVID -19 raises a 1472 particularly important issue, pertinent to those with pre -existing me ntal health 1473 conditions, which requires attention.154 The authors suggest that employers should 1474 consider how best to monitor staff with pre -existing mental ill -health and ensure the 1475 adequate provision of additional support for th is vulnerable group. Whilst an important 1476 recommendation, employers should be conscious that those experiencing psychological 1477 ill-health may be subject to stigma and discrimination, particularly in the workplace.155 As 1478 a result, efforts in the workplace to support those with pre -existing mental health 1479 conditions should be accompanied by due consideration of legal and ethical 1480 responsibilities \u2014 such as protecting employee confidentiality and preventing workplace 1481 discrimination 156 \u2014 so as to avoid the potentially adverse consequences of singling out a 1482 particular group. In healthcare settings, peer support pr ogrammes \u2014 which enable 1483 healthcare teams to support and monitor each other \u2014 have been proposed, as has 1484 training of team leaders to identify more serious mental health issues.157 1485 A number of other relevant recommendations \u2014 particularly with regards to future 1486 research priorities and design of interventions \u2014 to support the mental health needs of 1487 those with pre -existing mental health conditions can be found within the academic 1488 literature. 1489 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 45 Even at the start of the pandemic, the requirement for coordinated, mult i-disciplinary 1490 research to understand and reduce mental health issues in vulnerable groups \u2014 such as 1491 healthcare workers and those with pre -existing mental health conditions \u2014 was 1492 recognised as a priority for further study.158 In particular, experts have called for high - 1493 quality data to understand the causal mechanisms associated with poor mental health in 1494 order to optimise the effectiveness of psychological interventions for different groups, 1495 thereby enabl ing the development of evidence -informed interventions which can address 1496 causes that are thought to be modifiable. Moreover, exploring the coping strategies that 1497 have been successfully employed by those with pre -existing mental health conditions 1498 during the pandemic has been recommended, in the hope that these can be reinforced 1499 and expanded to improve future resilience.158,159 1500 Within the literature, there is a consensus that service users and people with lived 1501 experience of mental ill -health should be involved centrally in co -developing ethical 1502 research and designing inclusive mental health services, as well as in monitoring the 1503 quality of these services.111,158 Moreover, building in user -centred monitoring and 1504 evaluation techniques for mental health services should enable interventions to be 1505 amended or terminated if they prove to be ineffective. Regarding service provision, there 1506 is a ne ed to facilitate diverse and flexible access to mental health care, with a recognition 1507 that community support services or remote therapies may not be appropriate for 1508 everyone and, therefore, should be considered as an adjunct to mainstream mental 1509 health se rvices, but not a replacement. The authors of a position paper on how mental 1510 health care should change as a consequence of the COVID -19 pandemic, also stress the 1511 risks associated with promoting cheap \u2014 but ultimately ineffective \u2014 interventions, as 1512 this is likely to exacerbate existing inequalities and worsen mental health outcomes 1513 globally.111 1514 European Commission Initiatives related to supporting the mental health of 1515 essential workers 1516 The European Commission has invested over \u20ac 895 million on mental health. This includes 1517 better ways of promoting mental health as well as preventing, diagnosing and treating 1518 mental illness in different settings and across the lifespan, including research on effective 1519 new e -tools and care models. The res ults of a number of currently funded projects may 1520 help to support the mental health of the health workforce and other essential workers. A 1521 few of these projects are described below. 1522 In summer of 2020 the European Commission issued a second call for innova tive and 1523 rapid health -related approaches to respond to COVID -19 and to deliver quick results for 1524 the society addressing behavioural, social and economic impacts of the outbreak 1525 response . On December 1, 2020, it began to fund the RESPOND EU project 1526 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 46 (www.respond -project.eu ), which \" aims to accurately identify vulnerable groups - 1527 including healthcare workers - affected by the pandemic and to evaluate the impact on 1528 mental health and well -being. Additionally, the pro ject will address the mental health 1529 needs of vulnerable groups by implementing low -intensity scalable psychological 1530 programmes and will provide policy recommendations to inform future containment 1531 measures, improving quality of life on all levels during the health crisis. \" 1532 (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101016127 ). The project plans to implement t wo 1533 WHO interventions in a stepped -care approach. The first intervention involves an online, 1534 self-directed stress management course supported by trained non -specialist. The second 1535 intervention is a 5 -session program delivered by trained non -specialists addressing 1536 problem solving, stress management, behavioural activation, and accessing social 1537 support. The review of evidence undertaken in this Opinion suggests that addressing 1538 individual -level factors to support the mental health of the health workforce is not likely 1539 to be sufficient without organisational -level measures to complement the individual -level 1540 intervention. It is not yet clear how RESPOND EU might tailor the proposed intervention 1541 for healthcare workers to address the occupational -level risk fact ors identified in this 1542 Opinion. 1543 One particular call (SC1 -BHC-2019) focused on mental health in the w orkplace. These 1544 projects aim to develop and implement interventions that an employer organisation can 1545 take to promote good mental health and prevent mental illness in the workplace. A 1546 number of projects funded in January 2020 may provide new evidence and i nsights into 1547 effective means to support the mental health of the health workfor ce and other essential 1548 workers. 1550 model for the organis ational redesign of clinical work environments in order to enhance 1551 workers' wellbeing, retention, productivity and patient outcomes. Specifically, it will use a 1552 mixed -method design to determine direct and indirect individual and collective health 1553 outcomes and cost effectiveness. The aim is to improve mental health, reduce sickness 1554 absence and positively impact productivity and economic results through redesigned 1555 clinical work environments that promote mental health.\" 1556 (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/848031 ) The project approach involves twinning 1557 European hospitals with Magnet\u00ae recognized hospitals and developing an interactive 1558 online learning community. 1559 H-WORK (https://h -work.eu/ ) aims \"to create, apply and test a multi -level estimation 1560 and intervention instrument aiming to promote mental health in public organisations and 1561 SMEs. It will evaluate the outcomes of applied method s and offer proposals to employers, 1562 health professionals and policymakers. The project will create, prove and develop the H - 1563 WORK Innovation Platform, a system that will include advanced digital services, and 1564 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 47 facilitate the dissemination of H -WORK solutions across the EU.\" 1565 (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/847386 ). The project approach includes principles 1566 from positive psychology and incorporates a multi -level perspective using the IGLO 1567 model .160 Specifically, four different levels of analysi s and subsequent interventions will 1568 be targeted: t he individual employee (I), the group or work team (G), the leader (L) and 1569 the organisation (O) levels.161 Relevant to the conceptual framework in the current 1570 Opinion , this model has been expanded to IGLOO, which includes one more contextual 1571 level - the overarching context (O) that encompasses environmental factors like national 1572 context, culture, and welfare systems.162 1573 As a final example, EMPOWER ( https://empower -project.eu/ ) aims to \"investigate and 1574 test the impact and cost -effectiveness of a compatible eHealth intervention platform 1575 aiming to prevent common mental health complications an d reduce psychological distress 1576 in the workplace. The platform will be created in collaboration with stakeholders and 1577 direct employees and employers of SMEs and public institutions ....apply both qualitative 1578 and quantitative methods to assess personal effects, cost -effectiveness and potential 1579 obstacles to detect the major challenges on both an individual and organisational level. \" 1580 (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/848180 ). Policy recommendati ons can be expected 1581 as a project outcome. 1582 Projects funded by the European Commission may result in good or best practices that 1583 could be transferred to different settings or countries. As a tool for sharing best practices, 1584 The Public Health Best Practice Po rtal is a European Commission Directorate -General for 1585 Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) platform dedicated to providing reliable and practical 1586 information on the best implemented practices in health promotion, disease prevention, 1587 and the management of non -communicable diseases. It includes practices collected, 1588 developed and examined in actions co -funded under the Health Programmes. 1589 Stakeholders from Member States can submit a potential practice for evaluation. 1590 Practices are evaluated for inclusion in the pl atform using criteria adopted by the 1591 Steering Group on Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Management of Non - 1592 Communicable Diseases (Steering Group) according to the \" Criteria t o Select Best 1593 Practices in Health Promotion a nd Disease Prevention and Mana gement i n Europe \"163 1594 issued by the DG SANTE . A working definition for the concept of best practice is provided 1595 in this guideline, best practice being \"a relevant policy or intervention imple mented in a 1596 real life setting and which has been favourable assessed in terms of adequacy (ethics and 1597 evidence) and equity as well as effectiveness and efficiency related to process and 1598 outcomes. Other criteria are important for a successful transferability of the practice such 1599 as a clear definition of the context, sustainability, intersectorality and participation of 1600 stakeholders. \" When a practice is deemed to meet these criteria, it is accepted for 1601 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 48 publication in the Best Practice Portal and becomes available for Member States for 1602 transfer and/or broader implementation. 1603 Since 2016, more than 200 best practices have been published. Practices are searchable 1604 by general health topic, project/joint action, type of practice, country, and year. In April 1605 2021, t he drafting group examined the sub -set of best practices related to the mandate. 1606 All practices in the following area s/topic s of interest between 2016 and 2019 (all 1607 available years) were reviewed . 1608 Integrated approaches for mental health govern ance; 1609 Mental health in schools; 1610 Mental health in the workplace; 1611 Prevention of depression and promotion of resilience. 1612 This resulted in 29 best practices. One practice targeting children aged 5 -7 was removed, 1613 leaving 28. The titles of the remaining practices classified under other areas/topics of 1614 interest in the database were screened for relevance to the mandate . Four addition al best 1615 practices were added , for a total of 32 practices to review. In addition to the information 1616 available in the portal (origin of the practice, country , type of practice, area/topic of 1617 interest, year entered in database), data were extracted for each practice regarding 1618 geographical area (local, regional, national, EU), recommendations for future adopters, 1619 and demonstrated ou tcomes reported . Each practice was then rated on a 5 -point Likert 1620 scale to assess the potential impact on mental health outcomes while taking into account 1621 the me thodological rigour of the evidence . A rating of 5 was assigned to practices 1622 reporting effectiv eness data from a randomized controlled trial with cost -effectiveness 1623 findings, a 4 for effectiveness data from a pre -post trial measuring objective outcomes 1624 (e.g., suicides, hospitalizations, evictions), a 3 for lesser quality studies of objective 1625 outcome s (hospitalizations, employment), a 2 for positive changes in self -reported 1626 symptoms (distress, wellbeing), and a 1 for vague self -reported improvements as a 1627 result of the program. The table of Best Practices and assessment can be found in the 1628 Annex. 1629 Of th e 32 best practices to related to supporting the mental health of the health 1630 workforce and other essential workers, almost half (n=14) of them did not detail direct 1631 impact on mental health as a result of their implementation. Of the best practices 1632 reportin g results (n=18), only approximately one -fourth (n=5) reported favourable 1633 \"hard\" evidence for impact on objective outcomes (employment, hospitalizations, 1634 suicides). 1635 Only one practice, GET.ON - Online Health Trainings for improving mental health 1636 (Germany ; https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/dyna/bp -portal/practice.cfm?id=182 ) reported 1637 cost-benefit results. Specifically, they state that online training GET.ON Mood Enhancer is 1638 the first online training worldwide for which the prevention of depression has been 1639 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 49 confirmed in a randomised controlled trial. The cost -benefit analyses of GET.ON Stress 1640 and GET.ON Mood Enhancer indicated high net -savings on average per participant. Two 1641 practices, including Psychologically Informed Environments (UK; 1642 https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/dyna/bp -portal/practice.cfm?id=168 ) and various aspects 1643 of the European Alliance Against Depression (Germany ; 1644 https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/dyna/bp -portal/practice.cfm?id=275 ), show reductions in 1645 suicides, among other favourable results in objective outcomes. Two additional practices, 1646 Education: a key tool for recovery and fight against stigma (Spain ; 1647 https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/dyna/ bp-portal/practice.cfm?id=167 ) and Individual 1648 Placement and Employment (Italy ; https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/dyna/bp - 1649 portal/practice.cfm?id=183 ), showed reductions i n hospitalizations and doubling rates of 1650 individuals with mental illness in paid employment. 1651 1.4. Cost of mental health problems in the health workforce and the cost - 1652 effectiveness of mental health interventions 1653 Before examining t he body of evidence available o n the cost -effectiveness of mental 1654 health interventions in the workforce , it is important to caveat this work with the 1655 following l imitations . First, compared to other areas of research, there is a considerabl e 1656 scarcity of research regarding economic evalua tion of mental health interventions. 1657 Second, indirect (or societal) costs play an important role, as much of the cost burden is 1658 attributable to inability to work rather than costs associated with tr eatment .164 1659 Furthermore, p romoting and protecting mental health is typically i ntersectoral (involving 1660 actions undertaken by sectors outside the health sector), and this direct non -medical 1661 costs play an important role.165 Third, there are challenges with respect to defining and 1662 measuring outcome measures. Oftentimes only intermediate endpoints can be assessed 1663 and may not express the final outcome of symptom/disorder exacerbations, relapses, 1664 and recurrences. Because mental health affects many functions and produces m any 1665 symptoms, it is difficult for the outcome to encompass all of these impacts. Patient - 1666 reported outcome measures (PROMs) are especially relevant, as the objective of 1667 interventions to support mental health is primarily to improve individual's physical, 1668 mental, and social functioning. Quality -Adjusted Life Year (QALY) can be a valuable 1669 outcome measure , as it summaries the overall effect on quality of l ife over a given period 1670 of time and combines the quantity and quali ty of life gained from the intervention. Lastly, 1671 it is difficult to define a mental health \"intervention\" because a single intervention tends 1672 to have multiple elements that contribute to its effectiveness. This is even more 1673 challenging for complex interventions developed at individual, family, g roup, 1674 organisational, community, and societal levels. In conclusion, determining cost - 1675 effectiveness of interventions or programmes to support mental health is challenging 1676 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 50 because the evaluation must go beyond the economic costs and benefits to include 1677 social, organisational, and ethi cal impacts.166 1678 Costs of mental health problems in the workforce 1679 Even prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, mental health pro blems cause d significant 1680 financial impact. In 2013, the total cost of work -related depression alone in the EU -27 1681 was estimated to be \u20ac620 billion per year. The major impact is suffered by employers 1682 due to absenteeism and presenteeism (\u20ac270 billion), follow ed by the economy in terms 1683 of lost output (\u20ac240 billion), the health care systems due to treatment costs (\u20ac60 billion), 1684 and the social welfare systems due to disability benefit payments (\u20ac40 billion).167 1685 In 2014, European Agency for Safety and Health at Work ( EU-OSHA ) provided a detailed 1686 assessment of co sts of work -related stress by country for the overall population of 1687 workers and examined costs at societal and organisational levels .168 Reduced 1688 performance due to psychosocial problems are estimated to cost twice that of absence. 1689 In 2000, EU -OSHA reported that between 50% and 60% of all lost working days had 1690 some link with work -related stress , which le d to significant financial costs to companies 1691 as well as society in terms of both human distress and impaired economic performance . 1692 This impact amount ed to a yearly cost of about 3 -4% of gross national product.169 In the 1693 UK, losses due to work -related stress, depression or anxiety amounted to the equivalent 1694 of 9.9 million days, representing fo rty-three per cent of all working days lost due to ill - 1695 health during the period 2014 -2015.168 1696 The cost of mental health problems in the health workforce specifically has been 1697 assessed using a number of measures, from number of sick leave days to turnover and 1698 recruitment costs to discounted future values of health service loss as a result of early 1699 retirement. In the UK in 2009, the annual direct cost of st ress-related absenteeism was 1700 \u00a3425 million per year.170 In the US, a 2019 c ost-consequence analysis focused on lost 1701 income allowed estimation of burnout -associate d costs related to physician turnover and 1702 physicians reducing their clinical hours . The national annual economic costs ranged from 1703 $2.6 to $6.3 billion and, at the organizational level, $7600 per employed physician.171 A 1704 case study at two Stanford University hospitals in the US found that physicians who 1705 experienced burnout in 2013 had 168% higher odds of leaving the institution in the 1706 following two years , thus the estimated 2 -year recruitment cost incurred due to 1707 departure attributable to burnout was between $15.5 and $55.5 million.172 A systematic 1708 literature review was conducted to examine how burnout affects physician productivity. 1709 Number of sick leave days, work ability, intent to either continue practicing or change 1710 jobs was taken into account and estimated the cost of burnout on early retirement and 1711 reduction in clinical hours of practicing physicians in Canada . Discounted future values of 1712 the health service loss due to early retirement were $185.2 million and $27.9 mi llion for 1713 reduced clinical load.173 1714 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 51 Cost-effectiveness of workplace mental health programmes in general 1715 A 2013 economic analysis estimated the potential contribution of workplace mental 1716 health p rogram mes on reducing pressures on healthcare systems, social welfare 1717 systems, employers, and the economy as a whole in the EU.167 A simulation exercise was 1718 carried out to estimate the economic benefits across the EU of universal, targeted, and 1719 treatment workplace mental health programmes that generated a reduction in depression 1720 rates. The net economic benefits over a one -year period ranged between \u20ac0.81 and 1721 \u20ac13.62 for every \u20ac1 of expenditure on the programme. However, in absolute terms, the 1722 net benefit (the differe nce between the total benefits and the cost of delivering the 1723 programme) r anged from -\u20ac3 billion to \u20ac135 billion. This range illustrates that , for some 1724 programmes (Electronic CBT in this analysis in particular ), the costs of the program me 1725 exceed ed their be nefits. The other 5 programs ranked ordered from highest to lowest net 1726 benefits were: highest for an Exercise programme (135\u20ac billion), Acceptance and 1727 commitment -based therapy (ACT) (103 \u20ac billion) , Problem solving -based therapy (70\u20ac 1728 billion), Workplace imp rovement programs (2 8\u20ac billion), and stress management (6\u20ac 1729 billion). The se findings highlight the importance of ensuring that the implementation of 1730 workplace mental health programme s represents a good use of resources. 1731 A 2019 Deloitte report analys ed data from seven Canadian companies and concluded that 1732 investment in workplace mental health programs can mitigate the rising costs of doing 1733 nothing, and that investing in high -impact areas to better support employees can boost 1734 return on investment.174 The median yearly return -on-investment (ROI) on mental health 1735 programs was CA$1.62 , while c ompanies whose programs had been in place for three or 1736 more years had a median yearly ROI of CA$2.18. These findings s uggest that workplace 1737 mental health programmes are more likely to deliver greater returns as they mature, 1738 rather than yielding immediate financial benefits. In fact, a chieving positive ROI can take 1739 three or more years. Furthermore, the analysis indicated t hat m ental health program mes 1740 are more likely to achieve positive ROI when they support employees along the entire 1741 spectrum of mental health, from promotion of wellbeing to intervention and care, as well 1742 as the elimination or reduction of workplace hazards that could psychologically harm an 1743 employee. 1744 In the UK in 2006 , the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) used 1745 economic modelling techniques to generate cost -effectiveness evidence for three 1746 effective workplace stress management prog rammes. The findings indicated that t he net - 1747 benefit to employers ranged from \u00a3130 to \u00a35,020 per affected employee participating in 1748 the programme when including both absenteeism and presentism intervention -induced 1749 reductions. The net social benefit ranged from \u00a3115 to \u00a3420 per participating employee. 1750 These estimates were considered to be conservative values .175 1751 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 52 The German Initiative for Health and Work (\"Initiative Gesundheit & Arbeit / IGA) 1752 reviewed hundreds of studies and concluded that properly constructed and implemented 1753 health promotion initiatives can decrease absenteeism and a ssociated costs between 1754 12% and 36%. The ROI ranged from approximately 1 -to-5 to 1 -to-10 for absenteeism 1755 costs of absenteeism and 1 -to-2 and 1 -to-6 for illness -related costs.176 1756 Cost-effectiveness of programmes to support the health workforce and other 1757 essential workers 1758 No specific cost -effectiveness data for interventions or programmes to support the 1759 mental health of the health workforce and other essential workers during the COVID -19 1760 pandemic was identified in the evidence review for this Opinion. 1761 Regarding the cost-effectiveness of interventions following crisis situations, such as 1762 major incidents of terror ism, a \"screen -and-treat\" approach for Post -Traumatic Stress 1763 Disorder in the general population has been examined in England. The approach involves 1764 a combination of proactive outreach, screening using validated brief questionnaires , and 1765 evidence -based inte rventions . According 2020 p re-print results, the incremental cost per 1766 Quality -Adjusted Life Year (Q ALY) gained was \u00a38,297. Although t his finding was in the 1767 general population in the context of terrorism , it offers some indication of the expected 1768 benefits today of such a programme in implemented in organizations employing essential 1769 workers suffering the mental health consequences of the on -going COVID -19 1770 pandemic.177 1771 1.5. What are the conditions for the delivery of these interventions in a 1772 cost-effective, affordable and inclusive manner? 1773 Delivery conditions are conceptualized in this opinion using an implementation science 1774 framework.178 Implementation science is a field of study that examines the \"research -to- 1775 practice gap\" regarding the sustainable uptake of evidence -based practices or 1776 innovations. In implementation science research, the study of intervention effectiveness 1777 separated from implementation effectiveness, which typically refers to the strategies 1778 developed to disseminate th e intervention and address contextual barriers to intervention 1779 uptake. Implementation science is a growing field and, in the field of mental health 1780 specifically, research on these delivery conditions is lacking.179 Implementation science 1781 frameworks are available to help to structure the systematic capture of information 1782 regarding appropriate delivery conditions.180 1783 What is known i n the implementation science literature is that the success of 1784 implementation is context -dependent. Specifically, a review of contextual factors 1785 reported to be associated with implementation of healthcare initiatives found that culture 1786 and leadership were identified as strong influenc ing factors for successful 1787 implementation.181 Key components were varied and described at individual -, team - or 1788 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 53 organisational -based contextual factors , external environment and multilevel contextual 1789 factors (resources, leadership, management support, culture, evaluation, social capital, 1790 learning climate, compatibility , implementation setting) , with team characteristics being 1791 the least reported, although teams were deemed central to effective care organisation. 1792 Leadership was emphasized as quite important, yet examined at the organisational level 1793 in only a few studies reviewed.182 The quality, cost, and equity outcomes of delivery of 1794 health -related interventions may be influenced by the organization's capacity (e.g., size 1795 and capital assets) , formal and informal organisational structure (e.g., leadership , 1796 hierarchical structure, governance), finances to pay for the intervention , characteristics 1797 of the users (wants, needs, preferences), and culture (shared values, beliefs, 1798 assumptions).183 1799 Delivery conditions for the successful implementation of workplace mental 1800 health programmes in general 1801 The implication of the research in imp lementation science is that the effectiveness of 1802 interventions to address psychosocial hazards in the workplace does not depend only on 1803 the programme or inte rvention itself, but also on the ways it is organised and the context 1804 in which it takes place. Guidance for promoting mental health in the workplace184 offers a 1805 number of recommendations in this regard. Employee participation in the design, 1806 implementation and evaluation of programmes will improve their effectiveness and 1807 efficiency. Tailoring the programmes to the circumstances of a par ticular workplace 1808 context directly influences the likelihood of effective ness. Programmes must be evaluate d 1809 in real -time, as they happen , and re -assess ed and re -orient ed as required. Ethics 1810 requir e special attention in mental health programmes . Confidentiality of inform ation will 1811 need to be ensured. Programmes need to be targeted to benefit both employees and 1812 employers, and it should be made clear to em ployees that no harm can come f rom 1813 participati on. 1814 The UK Standard on risk management185 describe s additional principles to be applied 1815 when managing psychosocial risks: focus on working conditions, not individuals; address 1816 big issues; provide evidence of the effects of worki ng conditions on health; use valid and 1817 reliable measures; and target risk removal or reduction. Policies at the workplace to 1818 promote health and wellbeing must include: Health and safety, Health promotion, 1819 Rehabilitation and return to work, and Equality and non-discrimination. Good practices in 1820 promoting mental health at the workplace all show that it requires strong workplace 1821 policy and infrastructure. This entails: a clear policy that is well communicated to all 1822 employees, av ailable budget, having trained staff with clear responsibilities and 1823 accountability for its implementation, leadership and high levels of employee support. 1824 Overall, initiatives for supporting mental health need to be supported by all layers of the 1825 organisation. 1826 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 54 Specifically with respec t to inclusivity, CHRODIS+ Work Package 8 created A Training 1827 Tool for Managers to promote inclusiveness and work ability for people with chronic 1828 health conditions.186 This Training Tool includes a self -assessment for managers and 1829 employe es to measure the inclusiveness of an organization with respect to four areas: (i) 1830 Work Environment, (ii) Reasonable accommodations, (iii) Management and leadership, 1831 and (iv) Teamwork and leadership. The Training Tool also recommends measuring the 1832 work abi lity of employees using the self -report questionnaire the Work Ability Index 1833 (WAI) developed by the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH).187 The Training 1834 Tool offers tips to help the manager with developing an action plan for employee 1835 inclusion, stay at work, and return to work and related training packages. The Appendix 1836 examines frequent chronic diseases in the work place with factsheets containing quick 1837 frameworks and suggestions for appropriate management. Mental health issues, like 1838 depression, is one of the chronic conditions detailed. The documents references in this 1839 section are available in online format provides an illustration of the delivery conditions 1843 at multiple level s within an organization to facilitate successful implementation of 1844 workplace programs to support the mental health of essential workers. See Figure 4. 1845 Figure 4 Factors at multiple levels that facilitate su ccessful implementation of wellbeing, 1846 health, and work participation promoting actions at the workplace, and encourage 1847 employees to make use of these actions; 1848 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 55 1849 Source: CHRODIS+ Toolkit for Workplaces131 1850 Conditions for delivery of programmes to suppo rt the health workforce and 1851 other essential workers 1852 Regarding essential workers, and frontline health and social care professionals 1853 specifically, one review identified some barriers and facilitators to effective delivery of 1854 workplace interventions to support mental health during and after a disease outbreak , 1855 epidemic or pandemics (SARS, Ebola, MERS and COVID -19).117 Two i mportant barriers to 1856 effective implementation were: (1) lack of awareness about the needs and resources of 1857 frontline workers , either because they were not aware of their own needs, or because the 1858 organizations were not aware of them; and (2) r esource constraints, including lack of 1859 equipment, staff time and sk ills. Three important facilitators of effective implementation 1860 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 56 were: (1) flexible interventions that were culturally appropriate, adaptable and/or able to 1861 be tailored to meet local needs ; (2) effective communication and cohesion through 1862 horizontal and vert ical networks that strengthen social capital and improve d team 1863 resilience ; and (3) a positive learning climate for everyone involved in implementation of 1864 an intervention . Frontline workers' knowledge and bel iefs about the intervention acted as 1865 either a bar rier or facilitator to implementation depending on the study. 1866 Delivery conditions associated with mental health interventions to support the 1867 mental health of the health workforce and other essential workers 1868 To complement the evidence reviewed with respect to delivery conditions influencing the 1869 effectiveness of intervention to support mental health in the health workforce and other 1870 essential workers, additional data collection was carried out. In March 2021, t wo online 1871 focus groups were conducted with EXPH Mental Health Mandate drafting group members 1872 to address the question from the mandate: What are the conditions for the delivery of 1873 interventions to support the mental health of the health workforce and other essential 1874 workers in a cost -effective, affordable and inclusive manner. The discussion was 1875 structured into an examination of delivery conditions to be enacted by level according to: 1876 mental health practitioners, occupational health practitioners, senior man agement in 1877 sectors with high shares of essential workers, national policy makers, EU policy makers. 1878 Detailed notes were taken by two observers, and the focus groups were recorded. In the 1879 first phase of synthesis, bulleted information from the focus groups was grouped by level, 1880 including re -categorization of comments expressed in the context of discussions at other 1881 levels. Any information provided outside of the context of these levels of actors was 1882 grouped using thematic analysis. Notes were compiled and co ntrasted, and then 1883 reviewed by the facilitator of both groups. Any discrepancies and clarifications needed 1884 were resolved by consulting the recording to determine the exact expression and context 1885 of the information provided. 1886 In the second phase of informati on synthesis, in order to more clearly define the delivery 1887 conditions associated with mental health interventions to support the mental health of 1888 the health workforce and other essential workers, the bulleted points were re -categorized 1889 according to the fiv e high -level domains from the Consolidated Framework for 1890 Implementation Research (CFIR ; https://cfirguide.org/ ). The CFIR provides lists of 1891 categories associated with effective implementation of evidence -based practic es or 1892 interventions. It was developed in 2009188 and is widely used in implementation science 1893 to assess potential barrier s and faci litators of intervention implementation. The five 1894 overarching domains for the categories are: (1) Intervention characteristics, (2) 1895 Implementation Process (such as intervention champions), (3) Characteristics of the 1896 individuals involved (such as knowledge and beliefs about the intervention), (4) Inner 1897 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 57 setting (such as the organizational level characteristics, work culture), and (5) Outer 1898 setting (such as external policies and incentives).189 See Figure 5. 1899 Figure 5 The 5 Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) domains; 1900 1901 Source: Implementation Science Research Development (ImpRes) Tool Guide189 adapted 1902 from Damschoder et al., 2009188 1903 Each focus group bullet was categorized into one of five domains based on its content 1904 taking into account the full list of categories corresponding to each domain. Related 1905 bullets were combined by theme and any duplic ate information was eliminated. A 1906 summary document was prepared with findings related to delivery conditions grouped by 1907 domain. 1908 External stakeholders from the European Agency for Safety & Health at Work (EU OSHA) 1909 were tasked with responding to the information collected . They indicated: (1) If they 1910 were aware of any evidence that contradict ed the opinions expressed; (2) If they were 1911 aware of any evidence that suppo rted the opinions expressed ; (3) If they believed there 1912 was evidence that was missed . Responses were received in t hree of the five domains and 1913 were incorporated into the relevant sections of findings as described below . 1914 1. Intervention Characteristics 1915 The list of categories under this domain include the source of the intervention (internal 1916 vs. external), the strength and quality of the evidence supporting it, the relative 1917 advantage of using it, its adaptability, its trialability, its design and packaging, and its 1918 cost. 1919 The EXPH drafting group members placed particular emphasis on adaptabili ty. The 1920 intervention must meet user needs and adapt to their evolving needs over time. The 1921 intervention must be adaptable to personal factors such as age, family, and socio - 1922 economic status, and occupational factors such as whether the individual is a healt hcare 1923 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 58 worker or other essential worker, nurse vs. doctor, stress level, workload, 1924 control/demand job characteristics, and the potential for role switching, for example , with 1925 due consideration for the setting and mode of delivery . The interaction between pe rsonal 1926 and occupational risk factors requires consideration. To ensure adaptability and related to 1927 the internal source of the intervention, co -design and co -production of intervention was 1928 proposed. This would necessitate sound understanding of the needs of targeted, 1929 representative, and inclusive groups of potential intervention users. 1930 Furthermore, the drafting group members endorsed statements corresponding to 1931 intervention evidence strength and quality and cost, citing the need for more high -quality 1932 longitu dinal research on the cost -effectiveness of mental health interventions. This 1933 requires good monitoring and management systems, constant evaluation of 1934 interventions, and a focus on examination of mechanisms as to why an intervention is 1935 working. 1936 Finally, de sign and packaging is important. Specifically, emphasis on prevention was 1937 preferred over treatment because primary prevention was viewed as more cost -effective 1938 in the long -term. The preference for continuous care and intervention was endorsed such 1939 that it occurs prior to, during, and after a crisis. Appropriate referral systems must be in 1940 place, but peer support groups were highly supported by the EXPH drafting group 1941 members (over programs led by a mental health professional). Building and developing 1942 trust among co -workers was viewed as essential. These programs could be packaged as 1943 \"mandatory de -briefs\" or \"preparedness sessions\" to help deal with change. Training 1944 should include identification of early working signals of potential mental health 1945 deterioratio n or burnout. Widespread screening systems for mental health issues ought 1946 to be instituted and vouchers for follow -on care could be offered. Interventions should be 1947 integrated and multi -disciplinary and may include community -based intervention (e.g., 1948 exerc ise, meditation, and arts -based activities). Practicing self -compassion was 1949 considered an important intervention component. 1950 EU OSHA indicated that general occupational safety and health risk assessment in the 1951 workplace is a legal obligation of all employer s in the EU. They state that participatory 1952 psychosocial risk assessment should be part of this requirement and used to identify 1953 risks to mental health and inform design of an intervention. 1954 2. Implementation Process 1955 In the CFIR, categories related to the im plementation process of the intervention are 1956 separated from the intervention itself. These Process categories include planning, 1957 executing, reflecting and evaluating, and engaging different stakeholders, from opinion 1958 leaders to formally appointed implementa tion leaders, to \"champions\" of the intervention 1959 on-site, to external change agents, to the innovation participants themselves. 1960 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 59 The EXPH drafting group members addressed the categories of planning and executing 1961 the intervention by describing the importance of building competencies in mental health 1962 assessment for occupational health practitioners and managers. They also valued train - 1963 the-trainer programs to ensure sustainability of the intervention. Reflecting and 1964 evaluation of the intervention and implementa tion process was seen as an ongoing need, 1965 with constant evaluation and collection of feedback from intervention users. This quality 1966 assurance / quality control information should then be used to evolve the intervention 1967 and its implementation accordingly. A wide range of interventions should be offered to 1968 meet the needs of all potential users, which supports the Swiss Cheese Model of 1969 Intervention. The value of \"champions\" of the intervention was raised, in that peers who 1970 had participated in the program and f ound it beneficial could help promote it among their 1971 colleagues. 1972 3. Characteristics of the Individuals Involved 1973 The list of categories under this domain include the knowledge and beliefs about the 1974 intervention, self -efficacy, individual stages of change, i ndividual identification with their 1975 organization/workplace, and other personal attributes. 1976 The EXPH drafting members emphasized the importance of understanding the 1977 intervention users potential lack of interest in the intervention (related to stage of 1978 chang e) because of the stigma related to having or admitting mental health issues, 1979 especially for the health workforce. Furthermore, their knowledge and beliefs about the 1980 intervention regarding mental health as the target and the confidentiality of the data 1981 collected during the sessions was also viewed to influence use. The suggestion was made 1982 to NOT target those with a history of mental health and/or pre -disposing factors, as that 1983 may further alienate the individual from seeking help. 1984 Other personal attributes that were identified to influence intervention uptake and/or 1985 effectiveness were related to the diversity and heterogeneity of the workforce in terms of 1986 profession, culture, language, and ethnicity. Understanding the characteristics of early 1987 adopters of an intervention could be leveraged to expand reach, while, at the same time, 1988 seeking to understand those who do not want to use existing interventions or resources 1989 and why is also important. Cost was considered to be a possible barrier to be considered 1990 when planning format, content, and channel of implementation. In addition, to facilitate 1991 access to all interested individuals, the timing of the sessions (e.g., time of day, weekday 1992 vs. weekend) should be appropriate to the individuals given their commitments o utside of 1993 work and availability. 1994 Lastly, given the importance of the inner setting of the workplace that will be detailed in 1995 the next section, the individual's identification with their organization/workplace was 1996 viewed as a critical condition for success delivery of the intervention. Specifically, the 1997 individual must feel psychologically safe, trust his/her co -workers, and feel that the 1998 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 60 organization they work for and its members care about them and value they work they 1999 do. 2000 EU OSHA acknowledges that some m ental health problems may be caused or aggravated 2001 by poor psychosocial work environment that includes excessive time pressure, conflicts, 2002 violence, harassment, lack of support, and/or lack of appreciation. Those factors should 2003 be identified and addressed, either to prevent their occurrence or to remedy them once 2004 present, or both strategies can be worked in parallel. Insufficient intervention in this area 2005 may cause workers to be or become resistant and/or have feelings of resentment 2006 because they believe they need to 'change', while the problems in the work environment 2007 remain unchanged. 2008 4. Inner Setting 2009 This domain refers to the workplace and its organizational culture. It contains categories 2010 such as structural characteristics, networks and communications, culture, implementation 2011 climate (including tension for change, compatibility, relative priority, organizational 2012 incentives and rewards, goals and feedback, and learning climate) and readiness for 2013 implementation (including leadership engagement, available r esources, and access to 2014 knowledge and information). 2015 A large amount of time was spent during the focus groups discussing delivery conditions 2016 related to this domain and the EXPH drafting group members felt that, in order to 2017 support the mental health of the h ealth workforce and other essential workers, the most 2018 important delivery conditions occurred at this level of management or senior 2019 management. Some of the ideas presented previously relate to categories in this domain. 2020 For instance, the support shown for p eer group support interventions for the health 2021 workforce is related closely to networks and communication and issues surrounding 2022 stigma about admitting a mental health issue associated with organizational 2023 (dis)incentives and rewards. In particular, EXPH dr afting group members advocated that 2024 there should be no adverse consequences for help -seeking behaviour . Incentives could 2025 be offered for assuming extra work during the pandemic, and might include extra pay, 2026 few night shifts, shorter shift hours, and/or less administrative burden. In addition, 2027 performance assessment for managers should include indicators on the wellbeing of their 2028 employees. In this way, mental health would be placed on equal footing with other 2029 indicators, emphasizing the moral and ethical res ponsibility they hold with respect to 2030 their employees' wellbeing . 2031 Most of the interventions proposed by the EXPH drafting group in this domain related to 2032 effecting changes in organizational culture. For instance, there is a need to shift the 2033 mentality from blame on the individual for mental health issues to viewing them as the 2034 result of contextual or environmental challenges. The workplace culture must be one of 2035 acceptance of the continuum of mental health issues. They suggested that mental health 2036 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 61 professio nals be involved in occupational health activities in the workplace. Drafting 2037 group members advocated for the creation of \"flat hierarchies\", such as those in UK 2038 magnet hospitals designed to attract and maintain staff. Furthermore, they emphasized 2039 the need for fostering a psychologically safe workplace, where staff are comfortable 2040 expressing their thoughts and feelings. They extended this concept to the creation of a 2041 learning climate, where successes and failures can be openly shared and accepted. 2042 Factors r elated to readiness for implementation were widely discussed. Leadership 2043 engagement, in the form of top -down intervention from the \"big boss\" was seen to be 2044 one way for the organization to show they care. Leadership engagement in participatory 2045 processes wi th staff and involvement in team cohesion exercises was also valued. 2046 Training for managers was one form of access to knowledge and information and 2047 considered to be an important available resource. Specific training topics included 2048 general leadership, how t o conduct risk/needs assessments related to mental health, how 2049 to select appropriate interventions to meet those needs, how to value employees, and 2050 how to empower employees to create meaning in their work. 2051 5. Outer setting 2052 The domain refers to the context in which the inner setting operates. It includes 2053 categories such as user needs and resources, cosmopolitanism, peer pressure, and 2054 external policy and incentives. The majority of the focus group discussion was focused on 2055 recommendations for national and EU -level policy to support the mental health and of the 2056 health workforce and other essential workers and to support the workplaces and 2057 organizations to intervene within their inner settings to foster cultural changes in line 2058 with this goal. This discourse al igns well with the external policy and incentives category. 2059 Many themes were well -supported among members of the EXPH drafting group. They 2060 advocated for policies that prioritize mental health and wellbeing , to the same extent of 2061 cancer, for instance. Guida nce for national level mental health plans that focus on the 2062 mental health continuum and address diversity and inclusiveness are needed. At the 2063 same time, acknowledgement that implementation of plans occurs on local and regional 2064 levels means that support t o lower level implementation groups is critical. They wanted 2065 to see an increase in mental health care and support in the community and an improved 2066 integration of mental health and mental health professionals in to primary care settings. 2067 The number of menta l health professionals in the public sector should be increased, and 2068 professionals in the private sectors utilized in times of crisis. Mental health should also be 2069 integrated into occupational health and even safety to ensure adequate support for the 2070 health workforce and other essential workers. This action was believed to enhance 2071 compliance to standards. At the same time, the differences in the role of occupational 2072 health and the extent of mental health capacity across Member States must be 2073 acknowledged an d addressed so that no one state is left behind. Regulatory frameworks 2074 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 62 are needed to ensure clear accountability for staff mental health and wellbeing . Minimum 2075 standards entitling each citizen to some basic level of mental health support could be 2076 develope d. Competencies for mental health practitioners should be developed and then 2077 regularly assessed and certified. Mental health trainings for senior management should 2078 be mandatory, and training in mental health should be part of health professional 2079 curriculum s and continuing education programs. 2080 Inter-sectoral collaboration for mental health at the EU -level is warranted. For instance, 2081 support from DG Trade and DG Employment, Social Affairs, and Inclusion can extend EU 2082 influence over health. Health can be incorp orated into EU economic policies that are part 2083 of joint recovery from the pandemic. Sharing of cross -border and inter -regional 2084 resources to address surge capacity is also important. Furthermore, mental health data 2085 collection should be standardized across Member States. Regulation is needed ensure 2086 data collection on diversity -related characteristics such as ethnicity and sexual 2087 orientation. Mental health data trends of citizens should be tracked and aggregated at an 2088 EU-level. Enhanced protections, beyond th e GDPR, may be required to address issues of 2089 confidentiality and privacy in data collection, transfer and storage, especially for digital 2090 mental health interventions. 2091 In summary, the outer setting must provide the regulatory and financial structure to 2092 support inner setting interventions in the public sectors, companies, SMEs, and 2093 workplaces. Financing mechanisms are required, including sustainable support for long - 2094 term mental health prevention and treatment programs, research and development of 2095 innovative new programs, de -stigmatization interventions, care re -organization, 2096 regulatory frameworks, and data collection and harmonization initiatives. 2097 EU OSHA cites EU legislation on occupational safety and health (OSH) and the European 2098 Agency for Safety and Healt h at Work (EU -OSHA) indicating that protection of workers 2099 mental health is an integral part of OSH.190,191 2100 2101 1.6. Recommendations 2102 Suppor ting the mental health and the health workforce and other essential workers 2103 should be guided by the principles established in the Recommendations below. Each 2104 recommendation is further elaborated by Action points that clarify recommended 2105 instruments to be u sed by specific actors to carry out these principles. The level at which 2106 those instruments are defined is left open in most cases, as they may take place at local, 2107 regional, national or European level. 2108 A distinction is to be made between interventions wit h aim to restore a person's day -to- 2109 day functioning (it will involve mainly the health care sector and the individual) and 2110 interventions to avoid negative shocks on a person's day -to-day functioning (it will 2111 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 63 involve mainly the organisation, the health secto r and the wider institutional framework 2112 and legal/policy environment). 2113 Although our opinion is about essential workers, we believe these are good employment 2114 practices and should be implemented by all employers. 2115 Focusing on the positive aspects of mental we llbeing (physical and mental integrity), 2116 which is neglected in current evidence dedicated primarily to mental health issues or 2117 disorders, is a critical re -conceptualization that must be advanced to support the mental 2118 health of essential workers in a cost -effective manner. The discussion should not 2119 emphasise the negative effects of mental health illnesses, but rather promot e the 2120 positive aspects of mental wellbeing and address mental health illnesses when they 2121 cannot be prevented . We will use the terms menta l wellbeing and mental health 2122 interchangeably as first step on the proposed paradigm change. 2123 2124 Recommendation 1: Focus on mental wellbeing. 2125 Action point 1.1.: Re-conceptualize the discussion from mental health into mental 2126 wellbeing, which focuses on promoting the positive aspects of mental health and how to 2127 promote, maintain, or restore them. This action point is directed at all decision -makers at 2128 all levels and sectors. 2129 Policy makers should create this paradigm shift to re -frame/re -direct mental health 2130 discussion and foster national policy development and research efforts to align with it. 2131 2132 Recommendation 2: Treat mental wellbeing as a n inherent part of the 2133 organisation. 2134 Organisations (health care providers, providers of essential services) should treat 2135 provision of adequate environment for promotion of mental wellbeing of workers as 2136 major occupational safety dimension, including psychologically safe environ ment. 2137 Organisations should be able to detect \"warning signals\" for loss of mental wellbeing in 2138 workers and, eventually, emergence of mental health issues and disease that need help 2139 from a health professional. 2140 The term \"organisations\" covers here health ca re providers and providers of essential 2141 services. It includes government bodies and units, private for -profit companies, non - 2142 profit companies, charities, etc. 2143 Mental illness symptoms may manifest in cognitive, emotional, behavioural, and/or 2144 physical (or bo dily/somatic) ways. Symptoms are subjective in nature. Understanding of 2145 mental health and mental illness lags far behind our understanding of physical health. 2146 Assessment of positive mental health is even more challenging, requiring explicit efforts 2147 at this moment. 2148 2149 Action point 2.1: Have a mental wellbeing plan. 2150 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 64 Organisations should have a plan to address mental wellbeing of workers. This plan 2151 needs to support the entire spectrum of mental health (from promotion of protecting 2152 factors to sensitivity and tim ely action to \"warning signals\" at individual level as well as 2153 changing workplace hazards that may cause psychological harm to workers). This action 2154 point is directed at senior managers of all organisations with high shares of essential 2155 workers. 2156 There is a need for \"warning signals\" that lead to a more in -depth mental health 2157 assessment and eventually diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. Warning signals 2158 are to be produced at the organisation level, while mental health assessment is 2159 performed at individ ual. Requires that some assessment tool is in place, preferably 2160 keeping the individual process confidential. On this, the use of digital tools, by 2161 introducing distance between who is assessed and the organisation, can be helpful to 2162 reduce the stigma and vi sibility to others of the assessment. 2163 Organisations should establish monitoring and reporting of indicators reflecting on 2164 wellbeing (positive mental health) as well as suggestive of problems in organisational 2165 culture/ workload etc, and act on them. These i ndicators should be selected from a set of 2166 indicators to be made available at EU -level to ensure the same principles are applied 2167 uniformly, allowing for comparability and relative evolution. 2168 2169 Action point 2.2: Report on mental wellbeing. 2170 Organisations ar e to report, in a transparent way, on the internal mental wellbeing 2171 environment, using common indicators (see Recommendation 3). Organisations are to 2172 keep the detailed results of these indicators confidential but providing mechanisms to 2173 ensure an outside i nspectorate that the system is being used. This action point 2174 complements action point 1.1. It is directed to senior managers of organisations with 2175 high shares of essential workers (on the reporting duty) and to Government officials in 2176 the health sector (on the monitoring of this report by each organisation, which can be 2177 just ensuring it is publicly available. Penalties may apply if organisations do not report, 2178 though as first step positive acknowledgement of these reports is preferred as incentive 2179 mechanism for adherence). 2180 2181 Action point 2.3: Identify workplace hazards to mental wellbeing. 2182 Develop and improve protocols and standards for organisations to identify workplace 2183 hazards to mental wellbeing. This can build on the experience of the European Agency fo r 2184 Safety and Health at Work. This action point is directed for those responsible for health 2185 policies, both at national and EU level. Coordination at EU -level is desirable to ensure 2186 consistent practice. National implementation will adjust b etter to local cu lture. 2187 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 65 Organisations should be made aware of the relevance of changing internal culture and 2188 have the corresponding tools/approaches/instruments for effective handling of mental 2189 wellbeing of workers in place. Organizations could evaluate the risk for negati ve work - 2190 related mental health consequences. Organizations should provide psychologically safe 2191 environment and provide positive support to individuals with pre -existing mental health 2192 conditions and in collaboration with the individual and a multidisciplinar y occupational 2193 medicine team develop a specific plan to mitigate stressors at individual level. 2194 Small and Medium organisations may not have the scale to set up independently the 2195 tools required for an effective handling of mental wellbeing of workers (from promotion 2196 to treatment, if necessary). Thus, if the requirements and needs of workers' mental 2197 health are to be employed to all organisations, from small to large, some instrument, 2198 such as digital, needs to be made available to those that do not have a scal e to have own 2199 systems for this. 2200 2201 Action point 2.4: Ensure that organisations of all sizes participate. 2202 This may require providing tools to the organisations that are too small to develop own 2203 solutions. The use of digital tools is promising. This action poi nt is mainly directed at EU - 2204 level decision makers in a first step. There are obvious gains from avoiding duplication of 2205 work. National language implementation should be taken by national decision makers. 2206 This cross -cuts health, employment and digital areas of public policy. 2207 At the country or regional level, the appropriate public entity should provide digital tools 2208 or other appropriate widely deployable solutions for SMEs and organisations to have a 2209 minimum level wellbeing plan of workers in place. These to ols are at level of the 2210 organisation and they are not individual intervention tools. 2211 It may be helpful to design a digital tool at EU -level to help small and medium 2212 organisations to adhere to the framework with minimum cost. Large organisations need 2213 to en sure interoperability of their own tools and information systems with this EU -level 2214 digital tool. 2215 2216 Action point 2.5: Chart er of Rights to Wellbeing at the Workplace . 2217 Create an EU -level norm, Chart er of Rights to Wellbeing at the Workplace (or some other 2218 name) to set a norm, with observable elements for public opinion, that organisations will 2219 treat employees well. This action point is directed at EU -level decision makers. 2220 This Chart er of Rights would provide transparency and include accountability to care for 2221 employees' health as part of its effects. The elaboration of the Chart er of Rights to 2222 Wellbeing at the Workplace should make explicit reference to the EU Charter of 2223 Fundamental Rights, to the Euro pean Pillar of Social Rights and to the Universal 2224 Declaration of Human Rights. 2225 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 66 2226 Recommendation 3: Create a supportive institutional framework at EU -level. 2227 2228 Action point 3.1: Protect mental wellbeing in labour market legislation . 2229 Include mental wellbeing a nd mental health protection as part of legislation changes 2230 addressing employment conditions and social protection. This action point is directed at 2231 national decision makers responsible for public policy regarding employment and 2232 workplace conditions. 2233 The me ntal wellbeing and mental health of the health workforce and essential workers 2234 needs to be addressed by workplace general conditions, and as such supportive 2235 interventions outside the health care sector, and related to labour market conditions, are 2236 required . 2237 2238 Action point 3.2: Set an EU -level framework to measure wellbeing of workers. 2239 An EU -level entity should publish a set of indicators on mental wellbeing, defined at the 2240 organisation level. The information should include definition of wellbeing, each indicator 2241 and how to compute them with the least possible cost to organisations, smal l and large. 2242 This action point is directed at EU -level decision makers. 2243 The definitions need to ensure that data collection and indicator computation cover the 2244 same dimensions and have the same meaning everywhere. These indicators should 2245 include Mental Hea lth Person Reported Outcome Measures with a clear definition, to 2246 make information comparable over time and (eventually) over organisations. 2247 The possibility to set research funding at EU level for explicit work on the development of 2248 the measures to be ado pted is to be considered. There is currently a wealth of 2249 information in some countries that can be translated to other languages. Some new 2250 measures may have to be created. Providing a common set of concepts and ensuring 2251 they are understood in the same way everywhere is a necessary step. A review of 2252 existing indicators, their breadth of scope, common understanding and their usefulness 2253 should be done. 2254 2255 Action point 3.3: Develop reliable screening tools. 2256 These should be tools that the people may use for themse lves to assess their personal 2257 mental wellbeing status and would include clear messages on how to strengthen positive 2258 mental health and identify when and where to seek the help. This action point is directed 2259 at those responsible for health policies at natio nal level, though a coordination role to 2260 ensure consistency and comparability across geographies is desirable. 2261 2262 Action point 3.4: Ensure accountability. 2263 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 67 Define at national level which public entity has the responsibility to monitor the actions of 2264 organisat ions. It can be either a new entity or an entity that already oversees workplace 2265 conditions and employment contracts resolution (for example). This action point is 2266 directed at national decision makers in area of health and employment policies. Different 2267 countries may decide for different solutions that ensure similar final outcomes regarding 2268 accountability. 2269 2270 Action point 3.5: Provide protective\" workplaces. 2271 Build an EU-level handbook on how to prepare a \"mentally protective\" workplace, and 2272 update it regularly (every two years, at least) based on the latest evidence. Under a 2273 common EU -level framework, national and regional specific elements may be recognised, 2274 added by national entities of Member States. This action point is directed at E U-level 2275 decision makers. 2276 This handbook should help organisations to have a good internal process without being 2277 too normative (or trying to micromanage every single organisation, which would certainly 2278 fail). It should cover from definition to communication and to implementation). 2279 This handbook should help organisations to strengthen and/or develop processes to 2280 support positive mental health, and avoid internal stigma and discrimination associated 2281 with mental issues. It should help in building a supportive e nvironment and building on 2282 eliminating harassment (and gender -based harassment) in the workplace. Gender 2283 harassment in the workplace should be treated as one organisational dimension of 2284 promotion of mental wellbeing. 2285 As a complementary effort on the build ing of a general EU view, a useful tool can be a EU 2286 seal of excellence for mental wellbeing protection. 2287 Cost-effectiveness of interventions in mental health are mostly inconclusive and most 2288 have methodological limitations to the generalisation of results. Cost-effectiveness needs 2289 only to be explicitly considered for interventions involving public funding or public 2290 decisions over use of resources. If outcomes to be met are defined, organisations will do 2291 their internal assessment on the best way to reach the m (they will do their own internal 2292 cost-effectiveness analysis, even if not formally being named that way). 2293 Cost-effectiveness analysis of interventions in mental health are particularly difficult to 2294 perform due to the time horizon of those interventions (outcomes may take years to 2295 materialise) and due to the difficulty in establishing a precise causal link from 2296 intervention to mental health outcome (interventions are often tailor made to each 2297 individual, based on unobservable factors, such as organisation culture, peer support, 2298 empathy with health care provider and trust in the relationship by the patient). Also, the 2299 perspective adopted in cost - effectiveness analysis has to recognise the existence of 2300 spillover effects from mental health interventions outs ide the health sector. Thus, the 2301 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 68 societal perspective is enlarged and the payer perspective (public sector - national health 2302 service - in some countries) is too narrow to account for all relevant benefits. In 2303 particular, considering the impact on the labou r market of a mental -health related 2304 intervention, the common use of measures such as Quality -Adjusted Life Years may not 2305 be adequate. 2306 The general presumption obtained from existing studies and meta -analysis is that 2307 prevention interventions are generally cost -effective compared to non -prevention. 2308 2309 Recommendation 4: Create an appropriate cost -effectiveness framework. 2310 Set a research progr amme to develop a specific methodology of cost -effectiveness (cost - 2311 benefit) analysis of mental health interventions at all levels, having in mind all the 2312 specifics of the interventions, and that accounts for person -specific treatment plan 2313 (recognise that every treatment is different versus the standardised nature of other 2314 health interventions) and the long -time horizon of interventions (time to benefits 2315 manifestation). This action point is directed at EU -level decision makers in both areas of 2316 health and sc ientific research. 2317 Economic evaluation should be promoted in the field of mental health. Literature is very 2318 scarce on this issue, probably for good reasons of data availability and the challenges 2319 outlined above. 2320 It is necessary to recognise that many inte rventions that may not be cost effective for 2321 the organisation may be for society, so some public decisions may require a cost - 2322 effectiveness analysis to back them even if there is little or no public funding involved. 2323 2324 Recommendation 5: Build and share know ledge on interventions , further 2325 developing current initiatives . 2326 Build a robust evidence -based knowledge on interventions and mental wellbeing 2327 programs to take place at organisations. The knowledge base must result from a careful 2328 critical assessment and emp hasis should be placed on patient values being included in 2329 the assessment. 2330 Those responsible for developing intervention programs should utilize a \"swiss cheese\" 2331 approach in which complex evidence -based interventions are used to address a complex 2332 issue. A combination of interventions addressing different protective and risk factors and 2333 targeting different vulnerable and non -vulnerable groups at different levels (individual, 2334 organizational, community, societal) can help ensure comprehensive coverage so that 2335 \"no-one is left behind\" or \"falls through the cracks\" (holes). 2336 2337 Action point 5.1: Promote research. 2338 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 69 Provide research funding to help build a high quality knowledge base, filling the gaps in 2339 current research results. This action point is directed to both EU-level and national 2340 decision makers in health and employment (workplace safety) policies. 2341 The effort to build a knowledge base must focus research on protective factors that may 2342 help ensure quick and effective recovery after exposure to stress (harm -reduction 2343 approach), protect against adverse mental health outcomes prior to stress (protection 2344 approach), and/or promote positive aspects of mental wellbeing. They may be highly 2345 context/culturally dependent and may change over time. Potentially identify them not at 2346 individual level but for specific group of people, such as specific group of (essential) 2347 workers. Research to produce evidence needs to be able to provide an understanding of 2348 what matters, how it matters and how much it matters. Develop evidence on 2349 interventions on how people work in teams, to mutually support positive mental 2350 wellbeing (peer -support). 2351 It needs to ensure that the evidence -based body of knowledge includes a) outcomes at 2352 individual, organisation and population levels, b) detailed ana lysis of vulnerable groups; 2353 c) information on actual use of tools made available by interventions. 2354 The activation of this recommendation must deve lop and promote use of mixed 2355 approaches (qualitative and quantitative) in both implementation and evaluation of 2356 mental health programs and interventions, having clear targets at the organization level. 2357 It is also appropriate to predict adequate funding for pilot innovative mental wellbeing 2358 programs and interventions, with well -prepared evaluations, in order to bu ild an 2359 evidence -based body of knowledge regarding effective interventions and prevention 2360 strategies. This can be done at national and/or at EU -level. 2361 2362 Action point 5.2: Build conditions 2363 Create and foster the conditions for innovative and effective interve ntions and mental 2364 wellbeing programs to take place at organisations. Promote comprehensive interventions 2365 with the involvement of management structure, primary healthcare and community 2366 stakeholders. This action point is directed at national decision -makers responsible for 2367 health and employment. 2368 2369 Recommendation 6: A common vision for mental health care. 2370 Build a harmonised view, across Member States, of mental wellbeing promotion and of 2371 basic mental health care for individuals with mental illnesses . 2372 There is n eed to ensure that all member states share a vision that supports mental 2373 wellbeing promotion and adequate and timely access to health professionals when 2374 needed by the health workforce and essential workers. This also means a more general 2375 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 70 support to the cha nge to community mental health services (more advanced in some 2376 countries than in others). 2377 EU-level action should help MS and regions to learn from each other on best practices. 2378 Support and develop further a EU -level \"learning community\" for exchange of 'b est 2379 practices' on increasing mental health resilience on healthcare workers and other 2380 essential workers. Promote learning in action, involving learning through engagement. 2381 This effort should involve regional authorities (governance bodies), local administrative 2382 bodies (municipalities) and other local authorities in order to explore joint actions and 2383 strengthen community coalitions and supportive synergies. It should also promote 2384 actions for a better exchange of proposal and ideas between European s cientific societies 2385 and those that represent occupational medicine, mental health practitioners, public 2386 health, general practice and primary care, and other clinical and non -clinical disciplines 2387 (including psychology, social work, anthropology, among other s). 2388 2389 Action point 6.1: Move quickly 2390 At EU -level, identify low -cost but effective interventions that can be implemented quickly 2391 by member states that find themselves with limited capacity to provide mental health 2392 services. This action point is directed at EU-level decision makers in health and 2393 employment. 2394 2395 Recommendation 7: Prepare organisations and 2396 2397 Action point 7.1: Improve leadership. 2398 Train leaders of health care organisations on fostering positive mental wellbeing in their 2399 organisations and long -term thinking (instead of short -term emergency reactions). This 2400 action point is directed to national decision makers, covering health, employm ent and 2401 education (higher education in particular) policies. 2402 2403 Action point 7.2: Prepare for the job. 2404 Provide guidance and training on how healthcare organisations can actively \"prepare staff 2405 for the job\". Guidance should be provided on identification of th e moment to do it, and 2406 on what should be said and how. Address explicitly how organisations anticipate and 2407 prepare on burnout, moral injury, post -traumatic stress disorder and depression. This 2408 action point is directed at national decision makers. 2409 2410 Action p oint 7.3: Provide support in emergency situations. 2411 Prepare mechanisms to activate support in emergency situations to the health workforce 2412 and essential workers. This action point is directed at national decision makers and senior 2413 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 71 managers of organisations with high shares of essential workers, to collaborate on the 2414 identification and definition of best practices. 2415 Define mechanisms by which psychological support can be given during a crisis, and is 2416 known in advance that will be available. Those mechanisms ne ed to account for different 2417 needs and capacities to cope of small and large organisations. Those mechanisms need 2418 to account for the specific risks that frontline workers face. Also, define mechanisms by 2419 which professional support can be given during a cris is, and is known in advance that will 2420 be available. Those mechanisms should include, according to evidence, helplines and 2421 consultation from trained professionals. Finally, define mechanisms by which support to 2422 family life of essential workers can be given during a crisis and is known in advance that 2423 will be available. The support can include free transportation, accommodation and 2424 childcare. Provide stress management training to essential workers. 2425 This recommendation can be associated with a certification. Other possible ways to give 2426 content to this recommendation point are: promote the development and use of 2427 occupational (digital) mental health interventions, redirecting to health care services 2428 when appropriate; activate leadership to be aware of early warn ings (indicators and use 2429 of occupational (digital) mental health interventions), to ensure that timely and adequate 2430 action takes place: (i) organisation changes, to eliminate workplace hazards detrimental 2431 to mental health, (ii) at the individual level, an appropriate and timely channelling to 2432 healthcare/diagnosis takes place if needed; review and build on existing toolkits. As an 2433 example, the CHRODIS toolkit has helpful recommendations, easy to implement, and low 2434 cost actions. 2435 2436 Action point 7.4: Train for the long term 2437 Human resources management training and curricula should develop explicit mention and 2438 work with mental wellbeing of workers.

Communication should be done in 2452 a way that avoids stigma and it is compliant with data protection (as detailed in the 2453 GDPR). This action point is directe d at senior managers of organisations with high shares 2454 of essential workers. 2455 2456 Action point 8.2: Develop new solutions 2457 Develop the profile/role of 'primary care community psychologist', that works at societal, 2458 organisational and individual level. This actio n point is directed at national decision 2459 makers in health policies. International coordination is necessary to ensure consistency of 2460 solutions across the EU. 2461 2462 Supporting the mental health of health workforce and other essential workers 73 REFERENCES 2463 1.
