Nevertheless, CAMs are extensively used in common clinical practice in Western countries. We decided to promote a Delphi consensus to intercept the opinion of Italian physicians on CAM use in clinical practice. Materials and Methods: We run a Delphi-based consensus, interviewing anonymously 97 physicians. Of these, only 78 participate to the questionnaire. Results: Consensus about agreement and disagreement have been reached in several topics, including indication, as well as safety issues concerning CAMs. Conclusions: The use of CAMs in clinical practice still lacks evidence. Experts agree about the possibility to safely use CAMs in combination with conventional medicines to treat non-critical medical conditions.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-01-14", "cleaned_text": "Information Survey on the Use of Complementary and Alternative For these reasons, they are not included in the field of scientific medicine [ [4](#B4-medicina-58-00125)]. [5](#B5-medicina-58-00125)]. [6](#B6-medicina-58-00125)]: (I) whole medical systems (Chinese medicine, naturopathy, homeopathy, and Ayurveda); (II) mind-body interventions; (III) practices based on biology (i.e., traditional Chinese medicine and other non-biological substances); (IV) manipulative and body-based practices: (chiropractic and osteopathic (V) energy medicine (biofield therapies and bioelectromagnetic-based therapies). [7](#B7-medicina-58-00125)] and of the Council of Europe [ [8](#B8-medicina-58-00125)]: (I) acupuncture; (II) (VII) homotoxicology; (VIII) osteopathy; (IX) chiropractic. They are considered diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive systems that work alongside official medicine [ [9](#B9-medicina-58-00125)]. Assuming that any therapeutic intervention should be preceded by a correct diagnosis, CAM should be a medical act of exclusive competence and professional responsibility of the doctor, dentist, veterinarian, and pharmacist, each for their respective competences. On 7 February 2013, an agreement was issued in the Italian Permanent State-Regions Conference to regulate the professional profile of doctors who practice acupuncture, phytotherapy, and homeopathy, establishing professional registers [ [9](#B9-medicina-58-00125)]. There is a general scientific consensus that CAMs lack the necessary scientific validation, and their effectiveness is not proven, or even denied [ [10](#B10-medicina-58-00125), [11](#B11-medicina-58-00125)]. Many of the claims about the efficacy of CAMs are controversial, as research on them is often of low quality and methodologically incorrect [ [12](#B12-medicina-58-00125)]. [13](#B13-medicina-58-00125)]. Recent data show that nowadays, one in three patients with a neuro-muscular disorder has already gone through an osteopath or a chiropractor, or is being treated with acupuncture, or taking homotoxicologic or homeopathic products not for ideological reasons, but for therapeutic necessity: complications and/or intolerances to traditional drugs; or dissatisfaction or ineffectiveness of the treatment undertaken with official medicine [ [14](#B14-medicina-58-00125)]. More generally, in Italy [ [15](#B15-medicina-58-00125)], over one citizen out of five (21.2% of the population) uses CAM (with an increase of 6.7% compared to 2012), and homeopathy is the alternative cure more widespread. In fact, when deciding not to rely on traditional medicine, they are moving towards homeopathy (76.1% of patients who decide to be treated with CAM), followed by phytotherapy (58.7%), osteopathy (44.8%), acupuncture (29.6%), and, finally, chiropractic (20.4%) [ [15](#B15-medicina-58-00125)]. Today, the number of patients who choose CAMs is over 12.8 million, whereas in 2000, they were just over 6 million for all CAMs. The number of doctors who prescribed CAMs in 2000 was about 5000, and today that number is more than 20,000 [ [16](#B16-medicina-58-00125)]. 2. Materials and Methods [17](#B17-medicina-58-00125), [18](#B18-medicina-58-00125)]. A committee of 13 experts from Italian universities, public hospitals, territorial services, and research institutes formed the Consensus Board. Physicians with experience in the use of complementary and alternative medicines, ascertained by scientific publications on the subject, were considered. Physicians who had declared a possible conflict of interest were excluded. The Consensus Board reviewed the literature from November 2019 to February 2020, and, on the basis of the CAMs currently identified in questionnaire (Q1) [ [19](#B19-medicina-58-00125)]. Q1 has been submitted to a group of CAM experts, with different specializations, who were selected from among the largest Italian medical centers, specialized in CAM therapy, by means of a non-probability sampling method. The experts received an email in which the rationale and the aims of the research were explained. The email sent to each physician contained a strictly personal link to Q1 that allowed the questionnaire to be filled in online. Three reminder emails were sent to each expert in the 30-day period within which the Q1 had to be returned. To determine the consensus level, the answers to each question have been grouped into three tertiles according to the Likert scale scores (1-3: disagreement; S1 and S2](#app1-medicina-58-00125)). 4. Discussion [20](#B20-medicina-58-00125)], in Italy and EU, osteopathy and chiropractic are practiced by health professionals different from medical doctors (physiotherapists), with education often considered as unregulated [ [21](#B21-medicina-58-00125)], and this can explain the differentiation between these specialties and the others represented in the survey. [22](#B22-medicina-58-00125)]. Creating adequate knowledge, and reducing hesitation about the use of vaccines could therefore be an important goal for those doctors who practice CAM as well. Several clinical conditions can be treated by CAM according to our experts. [23](#B23-medicina-58-00125), [24](#B24-medicina-58-00125), [25](#B25-medicina-58-00125), [26](#B26-medicina-58-00125), [27](#B27-medicina-58-00125)], it is generally accepted that some approaches may improve pain and function in chronic conditions, such as osteoarthritis [ [28](#B28-medicina-58-00125)]. [29](#B29-medicina-58-00125)], thereby not being recommended in clinical settings [ [30](#B30-medicina-58-00125)]. [31](#B31-medicina-58-00125)]. [32](#B32-medicina-58-00125)], and different cases of asthma, in which current evidence does not support the systematic use of CAM in adults and children [ [33](#B33-medicina-58-00125)]. [34](#B34-medicina-58-00125)] or diabetic kidney disease [ [35](#B35-medicina-58-00125)]. Physicians must be aware, therefore, that the use of CAM is not supported in diseases requiring specific medical treatments [ [36](#B36-medicina-58-00125)]. In this case, however, it should be noted that the experts of our survey stated that CAMs should not be used alone when a replacement therapy (e.g., insulin or hormone replacement therapy) is needed. [37](#B37-medicina-58-00125)]. Also, some techniques not included in this survey, such as, for example, all those related to mindfulness, might be useful to control stress factors, considered important in the genesis of cardiovascular disease. [38](#B38-medicina-58-00125), [39](#B39-medicina-58-00125), [40](#B40-medicina-58-00125)], experts in our survey believe that CAM is useful to reduce collateral and adverse events during cancer chemo- and/or radiotherapy, as well as to give psychological support to the patients. CAMs are not considered as a therapy for the modification of the natural history of the pathology nor to prevent metastatic diffusion. 5.
