Antonow and D. Thurston, Chem. Rev. 2011, 111, 2815-2864). In recent years, there has been increasing applications of the PBD class of cytotoxic payloads as ADC therapeutics (Kung Sutherland, M. S., et al 2013 Blood 122, 1455-63; Jeffrey, S. C., 2013, Bioconjug Chem. 1256-63); Saunders, L. R. et al 2015 Sci Transl Med., 7(302):302ral36; Flynn, M. J. et al 2016 Mol Cancer Ther., 15(11), 2709-272;. Zhao, Robert Y., W02015028850; A. F. et al Bioorg Lett 27, 5267-5271) due to PBDs ' extream potency against most of the US National Cancer Institute 's (NCI 's) NCI 60-tumor-cell line panels along with unique mechanism of antitumor antibiotics activity (Mantaj, J. et al 2016 Angew . Chem. Int. Ed. 55, 2-29). As shown in structures below, all PBDs are usually conjugated to an antibody with one conditionally stable linker, because it is normally believed that linkers of ADCs must be stable while the ADC is circulating in the blood to limit off-target toxicity, but allow for release of the drug once it is inside the target cancer cells (Alain Beck 2017 Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, doi: 10.1038/nrd. 2016.268). Unfortunately the most advanced Vadastuxi- mab talirine (CD33 antibody-PBD conjugate having a conditionally stable linker) (Stein, E. M., et al, 2018 Blood 131, 387-96) experienced a set-back because of liver toxicity that apparently killed four patients in the early stage trials (www.xconomy.com/seattle/20 17/06/19 ).

Indeed, the application of the dual cross-linking prodrug strategy of PBD conjugation demonstrated much wider thereapeutic windows than the single 15 linkage of PBD conjugates both in vitro and in vivo. It therefore may have much potentially better antitumor antibiotic activities for PBD conjugates in clinic applications. 4 5 10 15 20 25WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The first embodiment of this invention is to disclose a dual linkage of conjugation of PBDs via attachement of both NlO positions of pyrrolo[2,l-c][l,4]benzodiazepine derivatives to a cell binding molecule, as shown in Formula (I), for targeted treatment of cell proliferation. or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, or hydrated salts, or the polymorphic crystalline structures of these compounds or their optical isomers, racemates, diastereomers or enantiomers; wherein: -----represents an optional single bond or can be absent; ===== represents an optional single bond or a double bond; V and V', the same or different, are independently selected from the group consisting of H, OH, -NHOH; OR5 (an ether); -SR ); SOR ); SOOR 5 (a sulfone); SO3, SO32' or HSO 2' bisulphite); NR5SOOR 55 metabisulfite); P(=S)(OR 5)(S)(OH) (a phosphorodithioate) or a (a hydroxylamine derivative); R5C(=0)N0H (a with a cation; HOCH 2SO2', or its acid), or NR5CO(Aa) t (a peptide ), wherein Aa is an amino acid or a polypeptide containing between t =1- 100 amino acid units; an aminoacid- derived group, such as an -, -, -, or -aminoacid, or an unnatural aminoacid; where R5, R55 and R55 5 are described below; 5 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 1, m, q, , m' and q' are independently a number of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5; n is 1\u201430; X, X', Y and Y' the same or different, independently, represent N, O, S, an alkyl, such as CH2 or CHR5, an alkene, such as =CH- or =CRs-, an ether, such as -C(ORs)H-.; Z and Z' the same or different, independently, represent N, CH, CR5, COH, CNH 2, CNHR 5, or COR 5, or Z and Z' link together with -COR 5OC-.

The immunoglobulin disclosed herein can be of any type (e.g. IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species. Preferably, however, the immunoglobulin is of human, murine, or rabbit origin. Antibodies useful in the invention are preferably monoclonal, and include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, bispecific, human, humanized or chimeric antibodies, Fv, Fab fragments, F(ab') fragments, F(ab ')2 fragments, fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-id) antibodies, CDR's, and epitope \u00ad binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens or microbial antigens. An \"enantiomer \", also known as an \"optical isomer \", is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable (not identical), much as one's left and right hands are the same except for being reversed along one axis (the hands cannot be made to appear identical simply by reorientation). A single chiral atom or similar structural feature in a compound causes that compound to have two possible structures which are non-superposable, each a mirror image of the other. The presence of multiple chiral features in a given compound increases the number of geometric forms possible, though there may be some perfect-mirror- image pairs. Enantiopure compounds refer to samples having, within the limits of detection, molecules of only one chirality. When present in a symmetric environment, enantiomers have identical chemical and physical properties except for their ability to rotate plane-polarized light (+/-) by equal amounts but in opposite directions (although the polarized light can be considered an asymmetric medium). They are sometimes called optical isomers for this reason. A mixture of equal parts of an optically active isomer and its enantiomer is termed racemic and has zero net rotation of plane-polarized light because the positive rotation of each (+) form is exactly counteracted by the negative rotation of a (-) one. Enantiomer members often have different chemical reactions with other enantiomer substances. Since many biological molecules are enantiomers, there is sometimes a marked difference in the effects of two enantiomers on biological organisms. In drugs, for example, often only one of a drug's enantiomers is responsible for the desired physiologic effects, while the other enantiomer is less active, inactive, or sometimes even productive of adverse effects. Owing to this discovery, drugs composed of only one enantiomer (\"enantiopure\") can be developed to enhance the pharmacological efficacy and sometimes eliminate some side effects. 15 5 10 15 20 25 30 35WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differs in neutron number. All isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons in each atom. Each atomic number identifies a specific element, but not the isotope; an atom of a given element may have a wide range in its number of neutrons. The number of nucleons (both protons and neutrons) in the nucleus is the atom's mass number, and each isotope of a given element has a different mass number. For example, carbon- 12, carbon- 13 and carbon- 14 are three isotopes of the element carbon with mass numbers 12, 13 and 14 respectively. The atomic number of carbon is 6, which means that every carbon atom has 6 protons, so that the neutron numbers of these isotopes are 6, 7 and 8 respectively. Hydrogen atom has three isotopes of protium ( H), deuterium ( H), and Otritium ( H), which deuterium has twice the mass of protium and tritium has three times the mass of protium. Isotopic substitution can be used to determine the mechanism of a chemical reaction and via the kinetic isotope effect. Isotopic substitution can be used to study how the body affects a specific xenobiotic/chemical after administration through the mechanisms of absorption and distribution, as well as the metabolic changes of the substance in the body (e.g. by metabolic enzymes such as cytochrome P450 or glucuronosyltransferase enzymes), and the effects and routes of excretion of the metabolites of the drug. This study is called pharmacokinetics (PK). Isotopic substitution can be used to study of the biochemical and physiologic effects of drugs. The effects can include those manifested within animals (including humans), microorganisms, or combinations of organisms (for example, infection). This study is called pharmacodynamics (PD). The effects can include those manifested within animals (including humans), microorganisms, or combinations of organisms (for example, infection). Both together influence dosing, benefit, and adverse effects of the drug, isotopes can contain a stable (non-radioactive) or an unstable element. Isotopic substitution of a drug may have a different thrapeutical efficacy of the original drug. \"Pharmaceutically \" or \"pharmaceutically acceptable \" refer to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce an adverse, allergic or other untoward reaction when administered to an animal, or a human, as appropriate. \"Pharmaceutically acceptable solvate \" or \"solvate \" refer to an association of one or more solvent molecules and a disclosed compound.

The reagents and starting materials are commercially available, or readily synthesized by well-known techniques by one of ordinary skill in the arts. All substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined. In the synthetic reactions of the cytotoxic agents of the present invention, it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice, for examples see Peter G. M. Wuts, Theodora W. Greene in Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th Edition, John Wiley and Sons, 2006; Ian T. Harrison, Shuyen Harrison in Compendium of Organic Synthetic Methods, Vol 1,2 Vols. 1& 2 By Ian T. Harrison & Shuyen Harrison , Vols 3-5 by Louis S. Hegedus, Leroy Wade Vols 6~Vol 12 by Michael B. Smith, John Wiley and Sons, 2006-2012. Normally the synthetic reactions are carried out in suitable solvents, temperatures and time. A variety of solvents which have no adverse effect on the reaction or on the reagents involved can be used in a synthetic reaction of the cytotoxic agent. Examples of suitable solvents include: hydrocarbons, which may aromatic, aliphatic or dimethylactamide dimethylformamide; alcohols ethanol and methanol and ethers, such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. The reactions can take place over a wide range of temperatures, from -100 \u00b0C - 300\u00b0C. More preferably from 0\u00b0C to 150\u00b0C. The time required for the synthetic reaction may also vary widely, depending on many factors, notably the reaction temperature and the nature of the reagents and can be from 5 second to 4 weeks, more preferably from 10 min to 24 hours. In addition, the cytotoxic agents prepared may be isolated or purified from the reaction mixture by conventional means, such as evaporating or distilling off the solvent from the reaction mixture, or after distilling off the solvent from the reaction mixture, pouring the residue into water followed by extraction with a water-immiscible organic solvent and then distilling off the solvent from the extract. It may also involve various well known techniques, such as re-crystallization, re-precipitation or the various chromatography techniques, 63 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 notably column chromatography, preparative thin layer chromatography, or high performance liquid chromatography . Some of the synthetic reactions of the cytotoxic agents and their conjugates to a cell binding agent are further exampled but not restricted in the Figures 1\u201432 and in the examples of the following description.

The average number of drug moieties per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, and HPLC . The quantitative distribution of the conjugates in terms of the drug loading may also be determined. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous the conjugates where Drug loading is a certain value from the conjugates with the drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.

Examples of these antigens that antibodies against are: Many other Cluster of Differentiations (CD2, CD2R, CD3, 72 Fos-related antigen 1. Production of antibodies used in the present invention involves in vivo or in vitro procedures or combinations thereof. Methods for producing polyclonal anti-receptor peptide antibodies are well-known in the art, such as in U.S. Pat. No. 4,493,795 (to Nestor et al). A monoclonal antibody is typically made by fusing myeloma cells with the spleen cells from a mouse that has been immunized with the desired antigen (Kohler, G.; Milstein, C. (1975). Nature 256: 495-497). The detailed procedures are described in \"Antibodies \u2014A Laboratory Manual \", Harlow and Lane, eds., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York (1988), which is incorporated herein by reference. Particularly monoclonal antibodies are produced by immunizing mice, rats, hamsters or any other mammal with the antigen of interest such as the intact target cell, antigens isolated from the target cell, whole vims, attenuated whole virus, and viral proteins. Splenocytes are typically fused with myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. Fused hybrids are selected by their sensitivity to HAT (hypoxanthine-aminopterin- thymine). Hybridomas producing a monoclonal antibody useful in practicing this invention are identified by their ability to immunoreact specified receptors or inhibit receptor activity on target cells. A monoclonal antibody used in the present invention can be produced by initiating a monoclonal hybridoma culture comprising a nutrient medium containing a hybridoma that secretes antibody molecules of the appropriate antigen specificity. The culture is maintained under conditions and for a time period sufficient for the hybridoma to secrete the antibody molecules into the medium. The antibody-containing medium is then collected. The antibody molecules can then be further isolated by well-known techniques, such as using protein-A affinity chromatography; anion, cation, hydrophobic, or size exclusive chromatographies (particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A, and sizing column 74 5 10 15 20 25 30 35WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 chromatography); centrifugation, differential solubility, or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Media useful for the preparation of these compositions are both well-known in the art and commercially available and include synthetic culture media. An exemplary synthetic medium is Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM; Dulbecco et ah, Virol. 8:396 supplemented with glucose, 20 mm glutamine, 20% fetal calf serum and with an anti\u00ad foaming agent, such as polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymer. In addition, antibody-producing cell lines can also be created by techniques other than fusion, such as direct transformation of B lymphocytes with oncogenic DNA, or transfection with an oncovirus, such Epstein-Barr be produced via an anti-receptor peptide or peptides containing the carboxyl terminal as described well-known in the art. See Niman the anti-receptor peptide or a peptide analog is used either alone or conjugated to an immunogenic carrier, as the immunogen for producing anti-receptor peptide monoclonal antibodies. There are also a number of other well-known techniques for making monoclonal antibodies as binding molecules in this invention. Particularly useful are methods of making fully human antibodies. One method is phage display technology which can be used to select a range of human antibodies binding specifically to the antigen using methods of affinity enrichment. Phage display has been thoroughly described in the literature and the construction and screening of phage display libraries are well known in the art, see, e.g., Dente et al, Gene. 148(1):7-13 (1994); Little et al., Science 246:1275-1281 (1989), Hoogenboom et al. in Methods in Molecular Biology 178:1-37 (2001) (O'Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J.), and in certain embodiments, in Lee et al. J. Mol. Biol. 340:1073-1093 (2004). Moncolonal antibodies derived by hybridoma technique from another species than human, such as mouse, can be humanized to avoid human anti-mouse antibodies when infused into humans. Among the more common methods of humanization of antibodies are complementarity \u00ad determining region grafting and resurfacing. These methods have been extensively described, see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,859,205 and 6,797,492; Liu et al, USA. 103(10):3557-62 (2006) each incorporated herein by reference. 75 5 10 15 20 25 30 35WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 Fully human antibodies can also be prepared by immunizing transgenic mice, rabbits, monkeys, or other mammals, carrying large portions of the human immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, with an immunogen. Examples of such mice are: the Xenomouse. (Abgenix, Inc.), the HuMAb- Mouse (Medarex/BMS), and 5,569,825. In human therapy, murine variable regions and human constant regions can also be fused to construct called \"chimeric antibodies \" that are considerably less immunogenic in man reference). In addition, site-directed mutagenesis in the variable region of an antibody can result in an antibody with higher affinity and specificity for its antigen (Brannigan et al, Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 3:964-70, (2002)); Adams et al, J Immunol Methods. 231:249-60 (1999)) and exchanging constant regions of a mAb can improve its ability to mediate effector functions of binding and cytotoxicity. Antibodies immunospecific for a malignant cell antigen can also be obtained commercially or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as, e.g., chemical synthesis or recombinant expression techniques. The nucleotide sequence encoding antibodies immunospecific for a malignant cell antigen can be obtained commercially, e.g., from the GenBank database or a database like it, the literature publications, or by routine cloning and sequencing. DNA encoding hybridoma-derived monoclonal antibodies or phage display Fv clones of the antibody can be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. by using oligonucleotide primers designed to specifically amplify the heavy and light chain coding regions of interest from hybridoma or phage DNA template). Once isolated, the DNA can be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as E. coli cells, simian COS cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein, to obtain the synthesis of the desired monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells (Skerra et al., Curr. Opinion in Immunol., 5: 256 (1993) and Pluckthun, Immunol. Revs, 130: 151 (1992)). Antibodies can also be produced by using an expression system in which the quantitative ratio of expressed polypeptide components can be modulated in order to maximize the yield of secreted and properly assembled antibodies. Such modulation is accomplished at least in part by simultaneously modulating translational strengths for the polypeptide components. After the fermentation which is known in the art, the produced antibody protein is further purified to obtain preparations that are substantially homogeneous for further assays and uses. Standard protein purification methods known in the art can be employed. 76 5 10 15 20 25 30 35WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 The exemplary purification procedures: fractionation on immunoaffinity (such as Protein A columns) or ion-exchange columns, ethanol precipitation, reverse phase HPLC, chromatography on silica or on a cation-exchange resin such as DEAE, chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and gel filtration using, for example, Sephadex G-75. Apart from an antibody, a peptide or protein that bind/block/target or in some other way interact with the epitopes or corresponding receptors on a targeted cell can be used as a binding molecule. These peptides or proteins could be any random peptide or proteins that have an affinity for the epitopes or corresponding receptors and they don't necessarily have to be of the immunoglobulin family. These peptides can be isolated by similar techniques as for phage display antibodies (Szardenings, J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2003; 23(4):307-49). The use of peptides from such random peptide libraries can be similar to antibodies and antibody fragments. The binding molecules of peptides or proteins may be conjugated on or linked to a large molecules or materials, such as, but is not limited, an albumin, a polymer, a liposome, a nano particle, as long as such attachment permits the peptide or protein to retain its antigen binding specificity. The cell-binding molecule/ligands or cell receptor agonists can be Ig-based and non-Ig- based protein scaffold molecules. The Ig-Based scaffolds can be selected, but not limited, from Nanobody (a derivative of VHH (camelid Ig)) (Muyldermans S., 2013 Annu Rev Biochem. 82, 775-97); Domain antibodies (dAb, a derivative of VH or VL domain) (Holt, L.

The cytotoxic agents, cross-linked PBD dimers of this invention can be directly conjugated (linked) to a cell binding agent, or via a bifunctional linker or a cross-linking agent to a The bifunctional linker possess two reactive groups; one of which is capable of reacting with a cell binding agent while the other one reacts with one or more molecules of cytotoxic agent of the invention.

Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described through this patent application. In additional embodiments, the linker may comprise amino acid residues. Exemplary amino acid linker components include a dipeptide, a tripeptide, glycine Amino acid residues which comprise an amino acid linker component include those occurring naturally, as well as minor amino acids and non-naturally occurring amino acid analogs, such as citmlline. Amino acid linker components can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by particular enzymes, for example, a tumor-associated protease, cathepsin B, C and D, or a plasmin protease. In the cell-binding agent - drug conjugates of the invention, cell-binding agent (Q) is conjugated to one or more drug moieties (Drug, or PBD derivatives), e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per cell-binding agent, through a bifunctional linker (L) . The conjugate of Formula (I), (II), (III), and (IV) may be prepared by several routes, employing organic chemistry reactions, conditions, and reagents known to those skilled in the art, including: (1) reaction of a nucleophilic group of a cell-binding agent with a bivalent linker reagent, to form Q-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with a drug moiety Drug; and (2) reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent, to form Drug-L, via a covalent bond, followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group of a cell-binding agent. To synthesize the conjugates of Formula (I), (II), (III) or/and (IV) in general, a function group E3 or/and E3' on Formula (V), (VI), (VII) and (VIII) reacts one, two or more residues of a cell binding molecule at 0-60\u00b0C, pH 5-9.5 aqueous media with or without addition of 0-30% of water mixable (miscible) organic solvents, such as DMA, ethanol, methanol, acetonitrile, THF, isopropanol, dioxane, propylene glycol, or ethylene diol, following by dialysis or chromatographic purification to form a conjugate compound of Formula (I), (II), (III) or/and 93 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 (IV). Some of the residue (reacting group for conjugation) of the cell-binding molecule can be obtained through protein engineering. The thiol or amine groups on a cell-binding agents, such as an antibody, are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker reagents sulfide exchange. Nucleophilic groups on a drug form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents. Nucleophilic groups on antibodies or proteins can react to electrophilic groups on a function linker following by reaction with a cytotoxic agent, or directly react to a linker- cytotoxic agent moiety to form cell binding agent-cytotoxic agent. Nucleophilic groups on antibodies or proteins include, but are not limited to: (i) N-terminal amine groups, (ii) side chain amine groups, e.g. lysine, (iii) side chain thiol groups, e.g. cysteine, and (iv) sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine, thiol, and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with groups on reducible disulfides, i.e. cysteine bridges which may be made reactive by treatment with a reducing agent thus form, theoretically, two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Alternatively, sulfhydryl groups can be introduced into antibodies through modification of lysine residues, e.g., by reacting lysine residues with 2-iminothiolane (Traut's reagent), resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into an antibody by introducing one, two, three, four, or more cysteine residues (e.g., by preparing variant antibodies comprising one or more non-native cysteine amino acid residues). Thus free thiol on the cell binding agents can be conjugated to the thiol-reactive groups, such as, a maleimide, an iodoacetamide, a pyridyl disulfide, or other the cytotoxic agents, or linker-cytotoxic agent intermediates of the invention. Some 94 5 10 15 20 25WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 unconjugated free thiols on the reform interchain and intrachain disulfide bonds. Antibody-drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by reaction between an electrophilic group on an antibody, such as an aldehyde or ketone carbonyl group, with a nucleophilic group on a linker reagent or drug. Useful nucleophilic groups on a linker reagent include, but are thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide. an antibody is modified to introduce electrophilic moieties that are capable of reacting with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. In another embodiment, the sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized, e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents, to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage, or may be reduced, e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment, reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta-periodate may yield carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) groups in the antibody that can react with appropriate groups on the drug (Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques). In another embodiment, antibodies containing N- terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta-periodate, resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid (Geoghegan & Stroh, (1992) Bioconjugate Chem. 3:138-146; U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,852). Such an aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile. Examples of these Drug*V? R HSlV BA D S-^k^CBA H wherein E includes, but is not limited to, such as CH 3i OrC 3Hs; J mesylate (MsO), nitrophenol, dinitrophenol, or pentaflourophenol. It is to be understood that where more than one nucleophilic group on the cell binding agents, such as an antibody, reacts with a drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of the cell binding agent-cytoxic agent conjugates with a distribution of one or more drug moieties attached to an antibody. The average number of drugs per antibody may be calculated from the mixture by a dual ELISA antibody assay, which is specific for antibody and specific for the drug. Individual conjugate molecules may be identified in the mixture by mass spectroscopy and separated by HPLC, e.g. hydrophobic interaction chromatography. In certain embodiments, a homogeneous conjugate with a single loading value may be isolated from the conjugation mixture by electrophoresis or chromatography . In the conjugation, The loading (drug/antibody ratio) of an ADC may be controlled in different ways, e.g., by: (i) limiting the molar excess of drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification, (iv) engineering by recombinant techniques the amino acid sequence of the antibody such that the number and position of lysine or cysteine residues is modified for control of the number and/or position of linker-drug attachments (such as thioMab or thioFab). The synthetic conjugate may be purified by standard biochemical means, such as gel filtration on a Sephadex G25 or Sephacryl S300 column, adsorption chromatography, and ion exchange or by dialysis. In some cases, a small molecule as a cell-binding agent (e.g. folic acid, melanocyte stimulating hormone, EGF etc) conjugated with a small molecular drugs can be purified by chromatography such as by HPLC, medium pressure column chromatography or ion exchange chromatography. 96 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 The aqueous solutions for the modification of cell-binding agents are buffered between pH 4 and 9, preferably between 6.0 and 7.5 and can contain any non-nucleophilic buffer salts useful for these pH ranges. Typical buffers phosphate, acetate, triethanolamine HC1, HEPES , and MOPS which as cyclodextrins, hydroxypropyl-P-cyclodextrin, polyethylene glycols, sucrose and salts, for examples, NaCl and KC1. After the addition of the drug-linker of Formula (V), (VI), (VII) or Formula (VIII) into the solution containing the reduced cell-binding molecules, the reaction mixture is incubated at a temperature of from 4 \u00b0C to 55 \u00b0C, preferably at 15\u00b0C - ambient temperature. The progress of the reaction can be monitored by measuring the decrease in the absorption at a certain UV wavelength, such as at 252 nm, or increase in the absorption at a certain UV wavelength, such as 280 nm, or the other appropriate wavelength. After the reaction is complete, isolation of the modified cell-binding agent can be performed in a routine way, using for example a gel filtration chromatography, an ion exchange chromatography, an adsorptive chromatography or column chromatography over silica gel alumina, thin layer chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, or HPLC . The extent of modification can be assessed by measuring the absorbance UV spectra. For the conjugation without a chromophore group, the modification or conjugation reaction can be monitored by LC- MS, preferably chain cross-linkers described herein have diverse functional groups that can react with any cell-binding molecules, particularly a modified cell\u00ad binding molecule that possess a suitable substituent. For examples, the modified cell-binding molecules bearing an amino or hydroxyl substituent can react with drugs bearing an N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester, the modified cell-binding molecules bearing a thiol substituent can react with drugs bearing a maleimido or haloacetyl group. Additionally, the modified cell-binding molecules bearing a carbonyl (ketone or aldehyde) substituent either through protein engineering, enzymatical reaction or chemical modification can react with drugs bearing a hydrazide or an alkoxyamine. One skilled in the art can readily determine which modified drug-linker to be used based on the known reactivity of the available functional group on the modified cell-binding molecules.

In a preferred embodiment, the conjugate of the invention in vivo clinical use will be supplied as solutions or as a lyophilized solid (such as powder) that can be redissolved in sterile water for injection. The conjugate in a liquid formula or in the formulated lyophilized powder may take up 0.01%-99% by weight as major gradient in the formulation. The rest of the formulation is excipients which are comprised of one or more of the following compounds: 0.5%~25% 0%~5% of Antioxidants, 0%~0.3% chelating agents. Suitable buffering agents for use in the formulations include, but are not limited to, organic acid salts such as salts of citric acid, ascorbic acid, gluconic acid, carbonic acid, Tris, tromethamine (tris(hydroxymethyl)- aminomethane) hydrochloride, or phosphate buffer. In addition, amino acid components can also be used as buffering agent. Such amino acid component includes without arginine succinate, etc. The formulations of 106 5 10 15 20 25 30 35WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 the buffers have a pH of 4.5 to pH 7.5, preferably from about 4.5 to about 6.5, more preferably from about 5.0 to about 6.2. In some embodiments, the concentration of the organic acid salts in the buffer is from about 10 mM to about 500 mM.. A \"polyol\" that may optionally be included in the formulation is a substance with multiple hydroxyl groups. Polyols can be used as stabilizing excipients and/or isotonicity agents in both liquid and lyophilized formulations. Polyols can protect biopharmaceuticals from both physical and chemical degradation pathways. Preferentially excluded co-solvents increase the effective surface tension of solvent at the protein interface whereby the most energetically favorable structural conformations are those with the smallest surface areas. Polyols include sugars (reducing and nonreducing sugars), sugar alcohols and sugar acids. A \"reducing sugar\" is one which contains a hemiacetal group that can reduce metal ions or react covalently with lysine and other amino groups in proteins and a \"nonreducing sugar\" is one which does not have these properties of a reducing sugar. Examples of reducing sugars are fructose, mannose, salts thereof. Preferably, a nonreducing sugar: sucrose or trehalose at a concentration of about from 0.01% to 15% is chosen in the formulation, wherein trehalose being preferred over sucrose, because of the solution stability of trehalose. A surfactant optionally in the formulations is selected from (polysorbate polysorbate 40, polysorbate 65, the Triton; sodium esters e.g. polysorbate 20, 40, 60 or 80 (Tween 20, 40, 60 or 80). The concentration of a surfactant is range from 0.0001% to about 1.0%. In certain embodiments, the surfactant concentration is from about 0.01% to about 0.1%. In one embodiment, the surfactant concentration is about 0.02%. 107 5 10 15 20 25 30 35WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 A \"preservative\" optionally in the formulations is a compound that essentially reduces bacterial action therein. Examples of potential preservatives include octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium alkyl groups are long-chain compounds), and benzethonium chloride. Other types of preservatives include alcohols such as phenol, butyl and benzyl 5% in the formulation. Preferably 0.01% to 1%. In one embodiment, the preservative herein is benzyl alcohol. Suitable free amino acids optionally for use in the formulation, but are not limited acid. The inclusion of a basic amino acid is preferred i.e. arginine, lysine and/or histidine. If a composition includes histidine then this may act both as a buffering agent and a free amino acid, but when a histidine buffer is used it is typical to include a non-histidine free amino acid e.g. to include histidine buffer and lysine. An amino acid may be present in its D- and/or L-form, but the L-form is typical. The amino acid may be present as any suitable salt e.g. a hydrochloride salt, such as arginine-HCl. The concentration of an amino acid is range from 0.0001% to about 15.0%. Preferably 0.01% to 5%. The formulations can optionally comprise methionine or ascorbic acid as an antioxidant at a concentration of about from 0.01 mg/ml to 5 mg/ml; The formulations can optionally comprise chelating agent, e.g., EDTA, EGTA, etc., at a concentration of about from 0.01 mM to 2 mM.

Isotonic formulations will generally have an osmotic pressure from about 250 to 350 mOsm. Isotonicity can be measured using a vapor pressure or ice-freezing type osmometer, for example. Other excipients which may be useful in either a liquid or lyophilized formulation of the patent application include, ficoll, gelatin, hydroxypropylmeth, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, ZnCl 2, zinc, zinc oxide, sodium citrate, trisodium 108 5 10 15 20 25 forms of carbohydrate having a carbonyl group reduced to a primary or secondary hydroxyl group. Other contemplated excipients, which may be utilized in the aqueous pharmaceutical compositions of the patent application include, for example, flavoring agents, antimicrobial agents, sweeteners, antioxidants, antistatic agents, lipids such as phospholipids or fatty acids, steroids such as cholesterol, protein excipients such as serum albumin gelatin, casein, salt-forming counterions such sodium and the like. These and additional known pharmaceutical excipients and/or additives suitable for use in the formulations of the invention are known in the art, e.g., as listed in \"The Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 4th edition, Rowe et ah, Eds., American Pharmaceuticals Association (2003); and Remington: the Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21th edition, Gennaro, Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (2005). In order to reduce patient pain during the injection of the formulation, a local analgesic agent can be used along with or prior to the injection of the formulation. Commonly used analgesics are: formulation of patent application can be prepared as a pre-filled syringe solution, or a freezing-dry powder, or through high-efficient spray drying powder .A pharmaceutical container or a vessel is used to hold the pharmaceutical formulation of the conjugates. The vessel is a vial, bottle, pre-filled syringe, or pre-filled auto-injector syringe. In a further embodiment, the invention provides a method for preparing a formulation comprising the steps of: (a) lyophilizing the formulation comprising the conjugates, excipients, and a buffer system to a powder; and (b) reconstituting the lyophilized mixture of step (a) in a reconstitution medium such that the reconstituted formulation is stable. The formulation of step (a) may further comprise a stabilizer and one or more excipients selected from a group comprising bulking agent, salt, surfactant and preservative as hereinabove described. As reconstitution media several diluted organic acids or water, i.e. sterile water, bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI) or may be used. The reconstitution medium may be selected from water, i.e. sterile water, bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI) or the group consisting of acetic acid, propionic acid, succinic acid, sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, acidic solution of sodium 30WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 chloride, solution of arginine, in an amount from about 10 to about 250 mM. A liquid pharmaceutical formulation of the conjugates of the patent application should exhibit a variety of pre-defined characteristics. One of the major concerns in liquid drug products is stability, as proteins/antibodies tend to form soluble and insoluble aggregates during manufacturing and storage. In addition, various chemical reactions can occur in solution (deamidation, oxidation, clipping, isomerization etc.) leading to an increase in degradation product levels and/or loss of bioactivity. Preferably, a conjugate in either liquid or loyphilizate formulation should exhibit a shelf life of more than 18 months at 25\u00b0C. More preferred a conjugate in either liquid or loyphilizate formulation should exhibit a shelf life of more than 24 months at 25\u00b0C. Most preferred liquid formulation should exhibit a shelf life of about 24 to 36 months at 2-8\u00b0 C and the loyphilizate formulation should exhibit a shelf life of about preferably up to 60 months at 2-8\u00b0 C. Both liquid and loyphilizate formulations should exhibit a shelf life for at least two years at -20\u00b0 C, or -70\u00b0 C. In certain embodiments, the formulation is stable following freezing (e. g., -20\u00b0C, or -70\u00b0 C.) and thawing of the formulation, for example following 1, 2 or 3 cycles of freezing and thawing. Stability can be evaluated qualitatively and/or quantitatively in a variety of different ways, including evaluation of drug/antibody(protein) ratio and aggregate formation (for example using UV, size exclusion chromatography, by measuring turbidity, and/or by visual inspection); by assessing charge heterogeneity using exchange (MALDI/TOF MS), or analysis to compare reduced and intact antibody; peptide map (for example tryptic or FYS \u2014C) analysis; evaluating biological activity or antigen binding function of the antibody; etc. Instability may involve any one or more of: deamidation (e.g. (e.g. hinge region fragmentation), succinimide formation, unpaired cysteine(s), N- terminal extension, C-terminal processing, glycosylation differences, etc. A stable conjugate should also \"retains its biological activity\" in a pharmaceutical formulation, if the biological activity of the conjugate at a given time, e. g. 12 month, within about 20%, preferably about 10% (within the errors of the assay) of the biological activity exhibited at the time the pharmaceutical formulation was prepared as determined in an antigen binding assay, and/or in vitro, cytotoxic assay, for example. 110 5 10 15 20 25 30 35WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 Examples of suitable protocols of conjugate administration are as follows. Conjugates are given daily, weekly, biweekly, triweekly, once every four weeks or monthly for 8~54 weeks as an i.v. bolus. Bolus doses are given in 50 to 1000 ml of normal saline to which human serum albumin (e.g. 0.5 to 1 mL of a concentrated solution of human serum albumin, 100 mg/mL) can optionally be added. Dosages will be about 50 pg to 20 mg/kg of body weight per week, i.v. (range of 10 pg to 200 mg/kg per injection). 4~54 weeks after treatment, the patient may receive a second course of treatment. Specific clinical protocols with regard to route of administration, excipients, diluents, dosages, times, etc., can be determined by the skilled clinicians. Examples of in vitro uses include treatments of cell cultures in order to kill all cells except for desired variants that do not express the target antigen; or to kill variants that express undesired antigen. Examples of ex vivo uses include treatments of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) prior to the performance of the transplantation (HSCT) into the same patient in order to kill diseased or malignant cells. For instance, clinical ex vivo treatment to remove tumor cells or lymphoid cells from bone marrow prior to autologous transplantation in cancer treatment or in treatment of autoimmune disease, or to remove T cells and other lymphoid cells from allogeneic bone marrow or tissue prior to transplant in order to prevent graft-versus-host disease, can be carried out as follows. Bone marrow is harvested from the patient or other individual and then incubated in medium containing serum to which is added the conjugate of the invention, concentrations range from about 1 pM to 0.1 mM, for about 30 minutes to about 48 hours at about 37 \u00b0C. The exact conditions of concentration and time of incubation (=dose) are readily determined by the skilled clinicians. After incubation the bone marrow cells are washed with medium containing serum and returned to the patient by i.v. infusion according to known methods. In circumstances where the patient receives other treatment such as a course of ablative chemotherapy or total-body irradiation between the time of harvest of the marrow and reinfusion of the treated cells, the treated marrow cells are stored frozen in liquid nitrogen using standard medical equipment. Examples of medical conditions that can be treated according to the in vivo or ex vivo methods of killing selected cell populations include malignancy of any types of cancer, autoimmune diseases, graft rejections, and infections (viral, bacterial or parasite). Examples of medical conditions that can be treated according to the in vivo or ex vivo methods of killing selected cell populations include malignancy of any type including, for example, cancer of the lung, breast, colon, prostate, kidney, pancreas, ovary, and lymphatic organs; melanomas; autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis; graft rejections, such as renal transplant rejection, liver transplant rejection, lung transplant rejection, cardiac transplant rejection, and bone marrow transplant rejection; graft 111 5 10 15 20 25 30 35WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 versus host disease; viral infections, such as CMV infection, HIV infection, AIDS, etc.; bacterial infection; and parasite infections, such as giardiasis, amoebiasis, schistosomiasis, and others as determined by one skilled in the art. The identification of those subjects who are in need of treatment of herein-described diseases and conditions is well within the ability and knowledge of one skilled in the art. A veterinarian or a physician skilled in the art can readily identify, by the use of clinical tests, physical examination, medical/family history or biological and diagnostic tests, those subjects who are in need of such treatment. A therapeutically effective amount can be readily determined by the attending diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, by the use of conventional techniques and by observing results obtained under analogous circumstances. In determining the therapeutically effective amount, a number of factors are considered by the attending diagnostician, including, but not limited to: the species of subject; its size, age, and general health; the specific disease involved; the degree of involvement or the severity of the disease; the response of the individual subject; the particular compound administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristic of the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the use of concomitant medication; and other relevant circumstances. The amount of a conjugate which is required to achieve the desired biological effect, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the chemical characteristics, the potency, and the bioavailability of the conjugates, the type of disease, the species to which the patient belongs, the diseased state of the patient, the route of administration, all factors which dictate the required dose amounts, delivery and regimen to be administered. In general terms, the conjugates of this invention may be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing 0.1 to 30% w/v conjugates for parenteral administration. Typical dose ranges are from 1 g/kg to 0.1 g/kg of body weight daily; weekly, biweekly, triweekly, or monthly, a preferred dose range is from 0.01 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg of body weight weekly, biweekly, triweekly, or monthly, an equivalent dose in a human. The preferred dosage of drug to be administered is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, the formulation of the compound, the route of administration (intravenous, intramuscular, or other), the pharmacokinetic properties of the conjugates by the chosen delivery route, and the speed (bolus or continuous infusion) and schedule of administrations (number of repetitions in a given period of time). The cell binding agent -cytotoxic agent conjugates of the present invention are also capable of being administered in unit dose forms, wherein the term \"unit dose \" means a single dose which is capable of being administered to a patient, and which can be readily handled and packaged, 112 5 10 15 20 25 30 35WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 remaining as a physically and chemically stable unit dose comprising either the active conjugate itself, or as a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, as described hereinafter.

To run the assay, the cells (180 pi, 6000 cells) were added to each well in a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Next, the cells were treated with test compounds (20 pi) at various concentrations in 10 appropriate cell culture medium (total volume, 0.2 mL). The control wells contain cells and the medium but lack the test compounds. The plates were incubated for 120 hours at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. MTT (5mg/ml) was then added to the wells (20 ) and the plates were incubated for 1.5hr at 37\u00b0C. The medium was carefully removed and DMSO (180 ) was added afterward. After it was shaken for 15min, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm and 570 nm with a reference 15 filter of 620nm. The inhibition% was calculated according to the following equation: inhibition% = [l-(assay-blank)/(control-blank)] x 100. The nude mice bearing nci-n87 along with T-DMl were evaluated in a human gastric carcinoma N-87 cell line tumorxenograft models. Five-week-old female BALB/c Nude mice (78 animals) were inoculated subcutaneously in the area under the right shoulder with N-87 carcinoma cells (5 x IO6 cells/mouse) in 0.1 mL of serum-free medium. The tumors were grown for 8 days to an Oaverage size of 130 mm . The animals were then randomly divided into 13 groups (6 animals per 10 group). The first group of mice served as the control group and was treated with the phosphate- buffered saline (PBS) vehicle. 12 groups T-DMl respectively at dose of 3 199 5 10 15 20 25 30WO 2020/006722 PCT/CN2018/094586 mg/Kg administered intravenously. Three dimensions of the tumor were measured every 4 days and the tumor volumes were calculated using the formula tumor volume =1/2 (length x width x height). The weight of the animals was also measured at the same time. A mouse was sacrificed when any one of the following criteria was met: (1) loss of body weight of more than 20% from Opretreatment weight, (2) tumor volume larger than 2000 mm , (3) too sick to reach food and water, or (4) skin necrosis. A mouse was considered to be tumor-free if no tumor was palpable. The results were plotted in Figures 33. All the 12 conjugates did not cause the animal body weight loss. And the animals at control group were sacrificed at day 35 due to the tumor volume Olarger than 2000 mm and some of them were too sick. Here 9 conjugates except CC-6 tested demonstrated better anti-tumor activity than T-DM 1. All 6/6 animals at the groups of compounds CC-4 and CC-3 had completely no tumor measurable at day 14 till day 30. In contrast T-DMl at dose of 3 mg/Kg was not able to eliminate the tumors. Example 187. Animal liver toxicity study of the conjugate CC-4, CC-29 at a high dose in comparison with T-DMl in ICR mice. Twenty ICR mice were then randomly divided into 4 groups (5 animals per group) and each animal was given 75 mg/Kg of the conjugates (PBS, CC-4, CC-29 and T-DM1) in a single I.V. injection accordingly. Five days after doing, a 150 pi blood sample was collected from the retro-orbital orbital venous plexus (sinus) of each mouse. After centrifugation of the blood samples, the serum was taken to assay AST and ALT levels according to test kits from BioSino Bio-Technology and Science Inc (Beijing, China). The mean values of AST and ALT from 5 animals per group are listed below. After mice were sacrificed, their liver tissues were collected, fixed in 10% neutral formalin solution, dehydrated with a sequence of ethanol solutions, and embedded in paraffin. The sections (5 pm-thick) were cut, transferred onto glass slides, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (Kieman JA (2008) Histological ASCP Press. American Society of Clinical Pathologists Chicago 1990). The stained samples were examined using a light microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U, Tokyo, Japan) and photographed at 200x magnification. As shown below, both CC-4 and T-DMl at dose of 75 mg/Kg elevated serum AST and ALT, to much higer levels than those in CC-29 group.
