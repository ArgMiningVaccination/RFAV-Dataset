A small probe is placed onto the cervix to freeze the cells. Cryocautery of the cervix is a minor form of treatment that uses very cold temperatures to destroy the superficial layer of the skin of the cervix. This treatment is used to treat what is known as a \"cervical ectropion\" which may have caused symptoms such as abnormal bleeding. Sometimes it is used to treat minor cell changes on the cervix called CIN 1 or cervical/vaginal/vulval warts. A cervical ectropion is a change to the lining of the cervix. These changes are a natural response to the female hormone oestrogen. They can occur during pregnancy, after having children, or among some women who take the oral contraceptive pill. A cervical ectropion is not an abnormality. It is not usually treated unless it is causing symptoms such as persistent discharge or bleeding during or after sexual intercourse. It does not affect your fertility. How does this treatment work? The cells which have been frozen come away in a watery discharge. New cells then grow and they are expected to be stronger. Benefits of treatment The benefit of having this treatment is that it will reduce the chance of heavy vaginal discharge and/or vaginal bleeding in between periods and after sexual intercourse. Risks of treatment Infection There is a small risk of infection following this procedure. Signs of infection are smelly vaginal discharge, high temperature and abdominal pain. To reduce the risk of infection we recommend that after the treatment you: - Use sanitary towels (not tampons) for four weeks - Do not have sexual intercourse for 3-4 weeks (or until any discharge has stopped completely) If you notice any of these signs of infection please make an appointment with your GP as soon as possible as they will be happy to assess you and offer the appropriate management. Pain You may experience some pain similar to period cramps immediately after this procedure. This should improve throughout the next 24 hours. If it does not improve please seek advice from your GP. Only if necessary should you seek advice from your local A&E department. Pregnancy This treatment will not affect your fertility (ability to conceive) although we do advise you do not have sexual intercourse for 3-4 weeks after the treatment in order to give the cervix time to heal. What to expect after treatment? You may experience some or none of the following: - Discomfort like period pain or period cramps for the next few hours - you can take simple painkillers for this - A watery discharge for up to four weeks which may be very heavy - Some light bleeding for up to three weeks Remember everyone is different and heals differently and some women will experience discharge for longer than others. The cervix needs time to heal. Will you need to come back to the colposcopy clinic? That will depend on why you had the treatment. We may be able to conduct your follow up appointment over the telephone rather than at the hospital. Your follow up will be discussed with you at your "}
