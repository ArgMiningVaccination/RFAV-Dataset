This National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan for Countering Biological Threats, Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness, and Achieving Global Health Security updates the 2018 National Biodefense Strategy and serves as a foundational component of the President's vision to create a world free from catastrophic biological incidents, laying out a set of objectives to effectively counter the spectrum of biological threats. It defines biodefense as actions to counter biological threats, reduce biological risks, and prepare for, respond to, and recover from biological incidents, whether naturally occurring, accidenta l, or deliberate in origin and whether impacting human, animal, plant, or environmental health. It is broader than a Federal Government strategy; it is a call to action for state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) entities, practitioners, physicians, scientists, educators, industry, and the international community to work together to elevate biological preparedness and response. Biological threats can impact human, animal (domestic and wildlife), plant, and environmental health. They require an integr ated approach that ensures the United States will address not only deliberate biological incidents as top national security priorities, but also epidemic and pandemic preparedness and global health security. The inclusion of naturally occurring and accide ntal biological threats underscores that our understanding of biodefense must be broader than only the threats posed by terrorist groups or adversaries seeking to use biological weapons. In today's interconnected world, biological incidents anywhere can p otentially have profound effects on physical and mental health and well -being in the United States and globally, cause significant morbidity and mortality, and disrupt livelihoods and economies, including domestic and international trade and travel. Throu ghout the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, every individual, community, and nation has experienced firsthand the health, social, and economic crises biological incidents can cause and the severe impact they can have on lives and livelihoods. The COVID -19 response has illuminated both longstanding and newly discovered limitations in local, national, and international biodefense capabilities. It has also resulted in the unparalleled mobilization of citizens, nations, and diverse sectors, and ga lvanized innovation to address a global biological threat. The pandemic has demonstrated the urgent need for sustained investment and coordination across the U.S. Government, private and nonprofit sectors, SLTT entities, our international partners and org anizations, and our communities to assess, prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from future biological incidents. Biological threats \u2014whether naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberate in origin \u2014are among the most serious threats facing the Uni ted States and the international community. As we have seen with the COVID -19 pandemic, biological incidents can cause extreme harm to the United States, including death, hospitalizations, disabilities, psychological trauma, and economic and social disruption on a massive scale. Biological incidents, whether naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberate, can originate in one country and spread to many others, with potentially far -reaching international consequences. Advances in life sciences and biotechn ology promise better and faster cures, economic advances, a cleaner environment, and improved quality of life, but they also bring new security risks that must be managed. In this rapidly changing landscape, the United States must be prepared to manage the risks posed by natural outbreaks of disease, accidents with high- consequence pathogens, or adversaries who wish to do harm with biological agents. NATIONAL BIODEFENSE STRATEGY 3 The health, prosperity, and security of the American people depend on our ability to stop inf ectious disease outbreaks at their source and rapidly and effectively contain biological incidents wherever they occur. The significant viral, bacterial, fungal, and other infectious disease outbreaks and toxin- related illnesses of recent decades impactin g human, animal, and agricultural health, including COVID -19, continue to reveal that the financing cycle of panic and neglect must end. There is significant and urgent need to achieve sustained investments and transformative improvements in the ability of both the U.S. Government and the international community to assess, prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from the next biological incident. Our capabilities must address the range of biological threats: emerging and reemerging infectious disea ses affecting humans, animals, plants, and the environment; risk of intentional misuse of advances in biotechnology; accidental release of biological agents; and threats posed by terrorist groups or adversaries seeking to use biological weapons.

PURPOSE This National Biodefense Strategy and Imple mentation Plan for Countering Biological Threats, Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness, and Achieving Global Health Security (Strategy) brings together a single coordinated effort to orchestrate the full range of activity that is carried out across the U.S. Gov ernment to protect the American people and its global interests from biological threats, regardless of origin. With National Security Memorandum -15 (NSM -15), this Strategy explains how the U.S. Government will manage its activities to more effectively ass ess, prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from biological threats, coordinating its biodefense efforts with those of SLTT entities, international partners, industry, academia, nongovernmental entities, and the private sector. The mission of the Fe deral Government during a biological incident is to save lives; reduce human and animal suffering; protect property and the environment; control the spread of disease; support community efforts to overcome the physical, emotional, environmental, and econom ic impact of the incident; and determine the cause and source of the incident. This federal mission is contingent upon coordination with and the response of SLTT entities, international partners, industry, academia, nongovernmental entities, and the priva te sector. This Strategy describes the goals and objectives that will guide the United States in assessing biological risks and developing risk-mitigation measures, as well as assessing, preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from a biol ogical incident, consistent with its international obligations, including those identified in the World Health Organization's International Health Regulations (2005). Enhancing the national biodefense enterprise will help protect the United States and its partners abroad from biological incidents, whether naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberate in origin. It will simultaneously build the U.S. innovation base for cutting -edge countermeasures, biosensors, diagnostics, and biosurveillance information t echnologies, and advance the biomedical and agricultural industries' biodefense capabilities. NATIONAL BIODEFENSE STRATEGY 6 THREATS AND CONSEQUENCES Naturally Occurring Biological Threats. Biological threats can affect humans, animals, plants, and the environment, resulting in significant health, economic, social, and national security impacts. It is therefore important to address biological threats using a One Health approach that recognizes the interconnections among people, animals (domestic and wildlife), plants, and t he environment. Infectious disease threats do not respect borders. Urbanization, climate change, habitat encroachment, economic interdependence, and increased travel, coupled with weak health systems, increase the ability of infectious diseases to spread rapidly across the globe. Novel infectious diseases, the resurgence and spread of once geographically limited infectious diseases, zoonotic diseases, and antimicrobial resistance can overwhelm response capacities and make outbreaks harder to control. As we have seen with the COVID 19 pandemic, an infectious disease outbreak \u2014even in the most remote places of the world\u2014could spread rapidly across oceans and continents, directly affecting the U.S. population and its health, security, and prosperity. Accid ental Biological Threats. The risk of laboratory accidents may be increasing with the rise in the number of laboratories around the world conducting high- risk life sciences research and research with potential pandemic pathogens without appropriate oversi ght. While this research is important for developing countermeasures and understanding and predicting future outbreaks, laboratories with insufficient biocontainment or biosafety protocols and practices exacerbate the risk of an outbreak through laborator y-acquired infections or accidental release of a pathogen into the environment. Even with state -of-the-art equipment and standard biosafety protocols, laboratory accidents are possible due to human error or mechanical failures. Deliberate Biological Thr eats. The use of biological weapons or their proliferation by state or nonstate actors presents a significant challenge to our national security, our people, our agriculture, and the environment. Multiple nations have pursued clandestine biological weapons programs, and a number of terrorist groups have sought to acquire biological weapons. In addition, advances in biotechnology, including synthetic biology, are making it easier to develop and use biological agents as weapons. In many countries around t he world, pathogens are stored in laboratories that lack appropriate biosecurity measures and could be diverted by actors who wish to do harm. Further, thousands of clinical samples generated during an epidemic can pose a biosecurity vulnerability if handled without appropriate security considerations, potentially facilitating access to materials and information that could be used in the development of a biological weapon. NATIONAL BIODEFENSE STRATEGY 7 BIOLOGICAL RISK MANAGEMENT Biological risk management requires understanding and assessing biological risks and taking steps to mitigate those risks, regardless of whether they originate in the United States or abroad. It also requires shared international recognition that the risk is global to empower effective, collective m itigation. The COVID -19 pandemic reminds us that the issue is not if, but when, the next biological incident will occur. As the biological threat landscape continues to evolve, so must our biodefense capabilities. If all countries could assess, prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from biological incidents at the local level, we could minimize the risk of nationally or internationally significant biological incidents, saving both lives and resources. Preventing acquisition of dangerous pathogens , equipment, and expertise for nefarious purposes, and maintaining the capability to rapidly control outbreaks in the event of a biological attack, are strategic interests of the United States. These must be strategic interests for our partners around the world as well. The United States cannot carry the burden alone, as an outbreak anywhere in the world can pose a threat to all. Finally, as we reap the benefits from biotechnologies and state -of-the-art research, we must also understand and consider the risks they pose. Accordingly, the United States will support an efficient and coordinated biodefense enterprise to protect the American people and its global interests. Domestic action alone is insufficient to protect America's health and security. The r apid globalization of science and technology and the increased interconnectedness through travel and trade necessitate a strong biodefense enterprise that has global reach to effectively assess, prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from biological incidents. The U.S. Government works domestically and globally to ensure that the United States and its partners are protected from naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberate biological threats. While the desired outcomes domestically and globally a re the same, the conditions and avenues available to achieve these outcomes can be very different. Internationally, our efforts to protect the United States and our partners include direct investment in sustainable, context -appropriate capacity building, and continued performance assessment and improvement, with the goal of achieving effective, country -led, and financed health security systems. We will work with multilateral organizations, partner nations, private donors, and civil society to prevent and control biological threats at their source by supporting the development and implementation of transparent biodefense and health security capabilities, policies, and standards. The United States has long been an innovation leader. To meet the biodefense g oals in this Strategy requires significant advances at the convergence of multiple disciplines, including biological, chemical, physical, and computational sciences. Whether augmenting our ability to provide healthcare and safeguard the environment or expanding our capacity for energy and agricultural production toward global sustainability, continued research and development is essential for a brighter future for the American people. To ensure that the United States is poised to meet the evolving biologi cal risk landscape, at a time when unparalleled advancement and innovation in the life sciences and technology globally continue to transform our way of life, we are committed to promoting innovation throughout the national biodefense enterprise. We will promote innovative technologies and systems; encourage technology communities and industry leaders to meet our targeted biodefense and health capacity needs; link stakeholders with new NATIONAL BIODEFENSE STRATEGY 8 ideas, tools, and products; enhance biosafety and biosecurity practices to minimize the risk of accidental or deliberate misuse of biological research and biotechnologies; and pursue innovative approaches and partnerships to achieve, domestically and globally, the goals articulated in Strategy. Through the Strategy, the Unite d States will use all appropriate means to assess, prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from biological incidents \u2014whatever their origin\u2014that threaten health and national or economic security. The Strategy recognizes that a collaborative, multisec toral, and transdisciplinary One Health approach to the national biodefense enterprise is necessary to counter biological threats effectively and efficiently. ASSUMPTIONS The evolving biological threat landscape requires a comprehensive approach, and the United States recognizes the following principles: Biological Threats Are Persistent. Pathogens have emerged and spread throughout history, and the risk from these pathogens grows more acute as the world becomes more urbanized, travel increases, and climate and habitat s change. Separately, nation -states and terrorist groups have found value in pursuing biological weapons, and there can be no confidence that will change in the future. Advances in the life sciences will both reduce the technological hurdle s to acquiring such weapons and expand the number of individuals with relevant skills to effectuate threats. Biological Threats Originate from Multiple Sources. Within the scope of biodefense, the United States includes countering both deliberate biologic al threats and threats that stem from naturally occurring and accidental outbreaks. This approach allows the U.S. Government to fully utilize, integrate, and coordinate the biodefense enterprise and ensure the most efficient use of all biodefense assets. Infectious Diseases Do Not Respect Borders. An interconnected world increases the opportunity for pathogens to emerge, reemerge, and spread such that a disease threat anywhere is a disease threat everywhere. Infectious diseases cross borders indiscrimina tely, whether via the movement of humans, animals, plants, or through the environment. The U.S. Government will mitigate biological incidents domestically and globally by working with our partners abroad, because the United States cannot counter biologica l threats domestically without addressing them globally. We will also seek to improve our ability to prevent the spread of infectious diseases to the United States \u2014 including those that affect humans, animals, plants, and the environment \u2014through inbound tr avelers and goods. The ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, African Swine Fever and Ug99 Stem Rust outbreaks, and the 2014, 2018, and 2021 Ebola outbreaks demonstrate that the U.S. Government must be prepared to act swiftly when outbreaks occur. A swift response necessitates engaging at the local, national, and international levels to galvanize support for and implement context -relevant interventions for the duration of the response. Furthermore, the United States must continue to exhibit catalytic global leadersh ip by working with multilateral institutions, foreign governments, public and private sector partners, and communities for coordinated, whole -of-society action to strengthen health security systems throughout the world. NATIONAL BIODEFENSE STRATEGY 9 Biological Incidents Impact Critic al Infrastructure and Supply Chains. COVID 19 has demonstrated the severe impact biological incidents can have on critical infrastructure and supply chains. Depending on the biological incident, a wide array of sectors may be vulnerable to disruption. The U.S. Government must work across sectors to improve the resiliency of critical infrastructure and supply chains, especially those most needed to mount an effective response. Multisectoral and Multilateral Cooperation Is Critical for Effective Biodefense. This Strategy calls for whole -of-government and whole -of-society engagement in biodefense, domestically and globally. Assessment, prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery involves diverse sectors, including medical; human, animal, and plant health; emergency response; scientific strategic risk communications; transportation; travel and tourism; and nonproliferation and counterproliferation sectors, among others. Engagement with SLTT entities, international organizations, nongovernmental organizations, communities, the private sector, and the general public is critical to prevent a biological event and respond to the next one. Transparency in communications, data sharing, surveillance, and response efforts by and with domestic and international partners is vital for success. A One Health Approach Reduces the Occurrence and Impact of Bioincidents. The health of people, animals, plants, and the environment are linked. One Health is a collaborative, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary approach at the local, regional, national, and global levels, with the goal of achieving optimal health outcomes recognizing the interconnection between people, animals (domestic and wildlife), plants, and our environment. Approximately 75 percent of new or emerging infectious disease threats to human health are of animal origin. Biological threats affecting humans, animals, or plants can cause physical harm to health a nd well -being and economic and supply chain disruption. Implementing a coordinated One Health approach is a best practice for understanding, communicating, and mitigating biological threats swiftly and efficiently. Such an approach is necessary to rapidl y and effectively assess, prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from biothreats, mitigating potential nationally or internationally significant biological incidents. Science and Technology Will Continue to Advance Globally. The ongoing revolution in the life sciences and biotechnology will continue at an ever -increasing rate, offering solutions to many of the challenges of ensuring the health, prosperity, and security of a growing global population. No longer confined to sophisticated research laboratories, these technologies are being developed and utilized all over the world, and the necessary expertise, materials, and equipment are widely available. Advances in science and technology bring revolutionary cures and progress, but they also have the potential for intentional misuse. The United States has a responsibility to ensure our technology , development, and assistance programs do not exacerbate this risk unintentionally. NATIONAL BIODEFENSE STRATEGY 10 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES The Strategy has five goals with associ ated objectives for strengthening the biodefense enterprise, establishing a layered risk management approach to countering biological threats and incident s. GOAL 1: Enable risk awareness and detection to inform decision -making across the biodefense enterpr ise. The United States will build risk awareness at the strategic level through analyses and coordinated research efforts to characterize naturally occurring, accidental, and deliberate biological risks; and at the operational level through One Health su rveillance and detection activities to detect and identify biological threats and anticipate biological incidents. Objectives: 1. Ensure decision- making is informed by intelligence, forecasting, and risk assessment. 2. Ensure that domestic and global biothreat detection, biosurveillance, and information systems are coordinated, integrated, and capable of enabling timely bioincident prevention, detection, reporting, assessment, response, and recovery. GOAL 2: Ensure biodefense enterprise capabilities to prevent bi oincidents. The United States will work to prevent the outbreak and spread of naturally occurring infectious diseases and minimize the risk of laboratory accidents both domestically and globally. The United States will also strengthen biosecurity to preve nt both state and non -state actors from obtaining or using biological material, equipment, and expertise for nefarious purposes, consistent with the U.S. Government's approach to countering weapons of mass destruction. Implementing Goal 2 will ensure we h ave the capabilities necessary to disrupt plots, degrade technical capabilities, and deter support for state and non- state actors seeking to use biological weapons. This goal also recognizes the dual -use nature of the life sciences and biotechnology, in which the same science and technology base that improves health, promotes innovation, and protects the environment can also be misused for harmful purposes. Domestically and internationally, the United States seeks to prevent the misuse of science and tech nology while promoting and enhancing its legitimate use and innovation. Objectives : 1. Promote measures to prevent or reduce the spread of infectious diseases. 2. Strengthen global health security capacities internationally to prevent local bioincidents from becoming epidemics. NATIONAL BIODEFENSE STRATEGY 11 3. Deter, detect, degrade, disrupt, deny, or otherwise prevent nation- state and non- state actors' attempts to pursue, acquire, or use biological weapons, related materials, or their means of delivery. 4. Strengthen biosafety and biosecurit y practices and oversight to prevent bioincidents and reduce biological risks associated with life sciences research and development and advances in biotechnology. GOAL 3: Ensure biodefense enterprise preparedness to reduce the impacts of bioincidents. The United States will take measures to reduce the impacts of bioincidents, including maintaining a vibrant national science and technology base to support biodefense; promoting a strong domestic and international public, veterinary, and plant health infr astructure; developing, updating, and exercising response and recovery capabilities; establishing risk communications; developing and effectively distributing and dispensing countermeasures; and collaborating across the country and internationally to support biodefense. Objectives: 1. Promote a vibrant, safe, and secure domestic and international science and technology base, including in biotechnology and biomanufacturing, to support biodefense. 2. Ensure a strong public, veterinary, and plant health infrastructure. 3. Develop, exercise, and update prevention, response, and recovery plans and capabilities, including efforts to secure critical supply chains. 4. Develop, exercise, and update risk communication plans and promote consistent, plain language messaging to in form key audiences, expedite desired response actions, and address public uncertainty and fear. 5. Enhance preparedness to save lives through development, testing, evaluation, manufacturing, regulatory approval, distribution, and administration of countermea sures. 6. Enhance preparedness to limit the spread of disease through community mitigation measures. 7. Enhance preparedness to support decontamination, waste management, environmental controls, and other methods of suppressing pathogens during a biological event. 8. Strengthen preparedness to operate and collaborate across the United States, including the U.S. territories. 9. Strengthen international preparedness to support international response and recovery capabilities. NATIONAL BIODEFENSE STRATEGY 12 GOAL 4: Rapidly respond to limit the impacts of bioincidents. The United States will respond rapidly to limit the impacts of bioincidents through information sharing and networking; evidence -driven, coordinated response operations and investigations; effective public messaging; and research. Objectives : 1. Compile and share biothreat, bioincident, and response information to enable appropriate decision -making and response operations across all levels of government and with nongovernmental, private sector, and international entities, as appropriat e. 2. Conduct evidence -driven federal response operations and activities and implement a federal research agenda in coordination with relevant nongovernmental, private sector, and international partners where appropriate to contain, control, and rapidly miti gate impacts of biothreats or bioincidents. 3. Conduct operations and investigations, and use all available tools to hold perpetrators accountable. 4. Execute risk -informed, accurate, timely, and actionable science- driven risk communications and community enga gement. GOAL 5: Facilitate recovery to restore the community, the economy, and the environment after a bioincident. The United States will take actions to restore critical infrastructure services and capability; coordinate recovery activities; provide r ecovery support and long- term mitigation; and minimize cascading effects elsewhere in the world. Objectives: 1. Promote restoration of critical infrastructure capability and capacity to enable the resumption of vital U.S. activities. 2. Ensure coordination of recovery activities across all levels of government and with nongovernmental, private sector, and international entities, as appropriate, to enable effective and efficient recovery operations. 3. Provide recovery support and conduct long -term mitigation actions to promote resilience. 4. Reduce the cascading effects of international biological incidents on the global economy, health, and security. NATIONAL BIODEFENSE STRATEGY 13 CONCLUSION COVID -19 has demonstrated the enormous dangers posed by biological threats, impacting virtually every community in the world. Mitigating these risks remains an urgent domestic and global imperative. Decisive action is required to build on the investments made for, and the lessons learned from, the COVID -19 response to protect the Nation and our partners from the full range of biological threats to humans, plants, animals, and the environment. Through this Strategy, the U.S. Government will optimize its own efforts and harness the work of essential partners \u2014inside and outside government, domestically and internationally - to assess, prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from biological events, whether naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberate, that can harm the American people and the global community. NATIONAL BIODEFENSE STRATEGY 14 ANNEX I: DEFINITIONS The terminology used throughout the Strategy is consistent with the following definitions: Biodefense: Actions to counter biological threats, reduce biological risks, and prepare for, respond to, and recover from bioincidents, whether naturally occurring, ac cidental, or deliberate in origin and whether impacting human, animal, plant, or environmental health. Biodefense enterprise: Stakeholders with a role in the prevention, preparedness, detection, response, and recovery from bioincidents (e.g., Federal and SLTT governments, nongovernmental and private sector entities, and international partners). Biological hazard (biohazard): A biological agent or biologically active substance \u2014excluding toxic chemical substances that are considered solely as chemical weapo ns agents, regardless of origin (e.g., naturally occurring or bioengineered) \u2014that represents an actual or potential danger to humans, animals, plants, or the environment. Biological incident (bioincident): Any natural or accidental occurrence in which a bi othreat harms humans, animals, plants, or the environment consistent with the scope of this Strategy ; A crime involving a biothreat consistent with the scope of this Strategy ; or Any act of biological warfare or terrorism.

One Health: A collaborative, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary approach working at the local, regional, national, and global levels, with the goal of achieving optimal health outcomes recognizing the interconnection between people, animals, plants, and the environm ent. NATIONAL BIODEFENSE STRATEGY 15 Nationally or Internationally Significant Biological Incident: A biological threat or incident with present or potential scale, timing, severity, complexity, or unpredictability to: cause harm to the United States or across international borders; overwhelm existing resources, countermeasures, and personnel; and threaten U.S. or global health, national, economic, or food security. NATIONAL BIODEFENSE STRATEGY i ANNEX I I: IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR THE NATIONAL BIODEFENSE STRATEGY OVERVIEW Coronavirus D isease 2019 (COVID -19) continues to take a tremendous toll on lives and livelihoods around the world, disrupting national and global security and affecting the national, health, and economic security of every nation. The United States must now chart a new vision for biodefense. The COVID -19 pandemic illuminated both longstanding and newly discovered limitations in local, national, and international biodefense capabilities, starkly demonstrating that continual investment in, and innovati ons toward, a biodefense enterprise must be a top priority for the United States. The United States will take actions to achieve and sustain epidemic and pandemic preparedness, counter biological weapons, and improve health security and global health in co llaboration with our international partners. The Biden -Harris Administration is setting our Nation on a course that is designed to provide all Americans a safe place to live and prosper. Through this implementation plan, we are setting forth a new moonshot , a set of bold outcomes for biodefense, which prioritize transformational technical and measurable targets. Achieving this vision will require not only the technical advancements but also necessitate sociological achievements, such as enhancing trust in s cience and overcoming a growing hesitancy towards safe and effective medical countermeasures. Domestic action alone is insufficient; achieving this vision necessitates working with multilateral organizations, partner nations, the private sector, and civil society to support and strengthen capacity to prevent and effectively control biological threats at their source. The outcomes prioritized in this implementation plan include the integration of the critical needed capabilities described in this Administration's American Pandemic Preparedness: Transforming Our Capabilities . Departments and agencies will implement these efforts, commensurate with available resources and subject to the availability of appropriations, in support of the National Biodefense Strat egy for Countering Biological Threats, Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness, and Achieving Global Health Security (Strategy) . The prioritized bold outcomes found here, mapped to the overarching Strategy, are intended to realize the unified vision across U.S. de partments and agencies that the United States must actively and effectively detect, prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from naturally occurring, accidental, and deliberate biological threats impacting humans, domestic and wildlife animals, plants, and the environment to create a world free from catastrophic biological incidents. NATIONAL BIODEFENSE STRATEGY ii IMPLEMENTING THE STRATEGY To fulfill its vision for biodefense, the Administration identified the following transformational bold outcomes for counter ing biological threats, enhancing pandemic preparedness, and achieving global health security. Under each Goal of the Strategy, the following actions will be implemented to achieve these priorities and advance the Strategy. Some activities may contribute to multiple Goals but are listed only under one for simplicity. The conditions and avenues to achieve the international elements of these priorities differ from those available for U.S. domestic capacities; they rely on direct and catalytic engagement throu gh partnership with multilateral organizations, partner nations, the private sector, and civil society to encourage prioritization of biodefense. Implementation of this plan is subject to the annual President's Budget process and the availability of appropriations. Nothing in this Implementation Plan shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. The U.S. Government will l ead and drive towards the historic goals laid out within this Implementation P lan. The U.S. Government can advance many of the actions described below , but we cannot do everything on our own. We will seek to advance these goals in partnership and collabora tion with international organizations, foreign governments, and state, local, tribal, and territorial authorities \u2014as well as other private sector, academic, and civil society stakeholders \u2014 that in many cases have primary responsibility and/or legal authority. For each priority (#.#.), a set of targets (#.#.#.), and corresponding actions (I ) have been identified. The priorities and selected targets and actions listed below provide direction as well as a concrete method for tracking and measuring progress towards the achievement of the outcome , with lead and supporting departments and agencies listed for each target. Implementation of this plan is a priority for the Administration and progress on implementation will be tracked internally through the regular updates to the Global Health Security and Biodefense Directorate of the National Security Council as tasked in National Security Memorandum -15 (NSM -15). In addition to the activities laid o ut in this section, agencies will implement all of the Strategy through existing policies, plans, and frameworks and consistent with existing statutory authorities. A demonstrative list of policies, plans, frameworks, and statutory authorities can be found in Annex I V. NATIONAL BIODEFENSE STRATEGY iii GOAL 1. Enable Risk Awareness and Detection to Inform Decision -Making across the Biodefense Enterprise The United States will build risk awareness at the strategic level through analyses and coordinated research efforts to characterize naturally occurring, accidental, and deliberate biological risks; and at the operational level through One Health surveillance and detection activities to detect and identify biological threats and anticipate biological incidents. 1.1. Early W arning Develop the ability to rapidly detect, characterize, report, forecast, and share relevant information (including genetic sequence data), as appropriate, on pathogens that pose a biological threat of national or international significance soon after they emerge in humans, animals , and plants. Early warning will inform and enable (a) early assessment and identification of the origin of biological incidents and (b) effective decision- making and interventions at local, national, and international levels . 1.1.1. Detection and Reporting of Biological Threats Develop domestic, and support the development of global, capacities and capabilities to detect and report disease outbreaks in humans, animals , and plants anywhere in the world and collect and rapidly share information, data, and samples including internationally and across sectors, with appropriate safety and security controls, to prevent or limit nationally or internationally significant biological incidents. I. Work domesti cally and with international partner countries to support and implement the development and integration of international systems and operating procedures to rapidly, safely, and securely share technical and analytical information, data, and samples support ing surveillance and mitigation to prevent or limit nationally or internationally significant biological incidents including a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

The policies, plans, frameworks, and legal authorities listed below are examples of many, but not all, of the authorities and guidance documents that the United States Federal Government relies upon to fulfill the United States Federal Government's vision for biodefense, including many important activities not included in the prioritized goals. These relevant policies, plans, frameworks, and legal authorities may change over time and, depending on the circumstances or nature of the biological threat, the United States Federal Government may rely upon other authorities not included herein to enable an appropriate and effective response. GOAL 1. Enable Risk Awareness and Detection to Inform Decision -Making Across the Biodefense Enterprise The United States will build risk awareness at the strategic level through analyses and coordinated research efforts to characterize naturally occurring, accidental, and deliberate biological risks; and at the operational level through One Health surveillance and detection activities to detect and identify biological threats and anticipate biological incidents.

Ensure Biodefe nse Enterprise Capabilities to Prevent Bioincidents The United States will work to prevent the outbreak and spread of naturally occurring infectious diseases and minimize the risk of laboratory accidents both domestically and globally. The United States will also strengthen biosecurity to prevent both state and nonstate actors from obtaining or using biological material, equipment, and expertise for nefarious purposes, consistent with the U.S. Government's approach to countering weapons of mass destruction. Implementing Goal 2 will ensure we have the capabilities necessary to disrupt plots, degrade technical capabilities, and deter support for state and nonstate actors seeking to use biological weapons. This goal also recognizes the dual -use nature of the life sciences and biotechnology, in which the same science and technology base that improves health, promotes innovation, and protects the environment can also be misused for harmful purposes. Domestically and internationally, the United States seeks to pr event the misuse of science and technology while promoting and enhancing its legitimate use and innovation.
