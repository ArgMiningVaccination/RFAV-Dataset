Chiropractic care focuses on properly aligning the body's structures\u2014primarily the spine\u2014to allow for natural, surgery-free healing. A chiropractor's goal is not to give patients drugs so they don't feel pain, but to discover the source of the pain and correct the problem. Why chiropractic? The nervous system controls all of the body's functions, and depends on the vertebrae in your spine to protect it. When your vertebrae are out of line, they can prohibit optimal operation of the nervous system, which can lead to various physical problems. Is it safe? Chiropractic treatments are incredibly safe\u2014actually, they're one of the safest kinds of health care available. Your chiropractor has studied extensively to fully understand the body's systems. The chiropractic-training program is comparable to the program of study for medical doctors. According to the American Chiropractic Association, more than 30 million people visited doctors of chiropractic last year for a variety of conditions, and more and more medical doctors are referring their patients to doctors of chiropractic. Chiropractic treatment is the number one complimentary/alternative care treatment used in the United States today. What problems can it address? In addition to preventative and wellness care, chiropractic can be used to treat allergies, headaches, lower back pain, fibromyalgia, neck and shoulder pain, numbness, leg pain, scoliosis, and other health issues.
