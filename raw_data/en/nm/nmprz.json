It is the periphery. This is where every chronic dis - ease begins, even if the skin as an organ is ap - parently not affected by it. Y et the physiologi - cal immune defence reflects through fever and sweating whether patients can differentiate be - tween themselves and others - or not. How sorry the state of this situation looks is proven by the many patients who can no longer have fevers and sweat. This results in disease-caus - ing consequences. It is therefore meaningful to orient a healing process towards the goal of patients once again being able to have fevers and sweat. This brings holistic thinking and a holistic treatment concept full circle. There are also inner skins throughout the body that have the same properties of separating one thing from another. They draw a boundary and therefore also participate in the inner structure of the organism. In addition to the property of a \"separating wall\" , the skins also have the task of keeping the adjoining organs mobile. The skin comes at the conclusion of this series and assumes an important dramaturgical place since diseases are manifested on it and with it in the broadest sense. The language of every - day life is good at expressing this in phrases such as \"thick-skinned\" or \"thin-skinned\" people, as well as occurrences that get \"un - der the skin. \" The findings of brain research have taught us that dementia is advancing so rapidly because seniors, especially, no longer experience things that get under the skin to give them an emotional challenge. As human beings, we require problems in the best sense in order to be challenged in finding solutions. In one of his lectures, the well-known brain researcher Professor Dr. H\u00fcther mentioned two simple challenges that get under the skin in order to prevent dementia: 1. Group singing and 2. Children. I can wholeheartedly agree with this observation. Most problems that lead to chronic diseases begin at the skin in both the real and the fig - urative sense. Workaholics - the symbol for modern actionism - lose their sense of life rhythm, breathe in a shallow and hectic way, and speak in a truncated language. They feel that they are cool; nothing gets in and also nothing radiates to the outside. Regulation rigidity is the consequence. If someone rec - ommends that they sing - in their circle of friends as a therapeutic measure - to resolve the symptoms that they complain about , they would consider this person to be crazy. And yet, it is true that singing and music encompass the entire human being and the skin becomes warm and starts to vibrate. Here is an amusing anecdote that I experi - enced in 2009 at a Felke treatment hotel. Quite a few intellectuals and academics were there for a course of treatment. None of them spoke with the others, and each of them detached themselves from the group. Then there was an announcement that group singing with a guitarist would be offered on Tuesday even - ing. I assumed that I would (once again) be the only person to show up there. But no, the room was full of people who were in the mood to sing, but their attitude and facial expressions looked like they were expecting a court hear - ing. A university professor emeritus sat next to me. He greeted me curtly without even look -10 Prefa Ce to thIs volume ing my way. I smiled at him and said: \"How wonderful that you came to the group sing- ing. \" He responded: \"Well, let's see if it's good for something. \" The ballad singer and guitarist soon had all of us captivated. Titles and professions became unimportant, people emerged, laughed with each other and belted out the songs with fer - vour. Every person was soon beaming at the others. Their cheeks turned red, smiles ap - peared and a healing atmosphere filled the room. At the end of the hour, the professor next to me said: \"It was nice to sing out of the notebook with you. What's your name?\" He gallantly took my hand and introduced him - self, then said: \"My back feels so much better now. I'm surprised at the effects of singing!\" Y es, singing connects people. It makes them capable of relationships and drives away fears. Fear constricts, but singing expands. People must assume an open body posture and raise their heads in order to even be able to produce a tone. Music gets under the skin and touches us on the emotional level. Once again getting in touch with our feelings is easier and quicker through singing than a conversational therapy. In addition, the long exhalation of singing has a beneficial effect on the body's circulation, the acid-alkaline balance, the hormonal system and causes stress to be reduced. Performing music, no matter how amateur this attempt may be, fulfils the heart. Through the skin, it puts the entire person into a state of organised vibrations. The many serious skin diseases of our age show how vulnerable modern individu - als have become and how far they have dis - tanced themselves from a healthy life rhythm of 3:2: three portions of activity, two portions of passivity/ rest/ break. If the skin reacts and communicates in its organ language that \"you are not feeling well; you are off kilter, \" it is si - lenced. Chemical medications conjure up a smooth, pimple-free facade so that the illness is pushed inside. If a suppression of eczema is followed by epilepsy, renal insufficiency or depression, these reactions are treated sepa - rately in areas of medical specialisation. In - stead of being treated sympathetically with the hands, they are also spirited away. Then the illness advances to the vital organs and produces destructive processes. A gigantic ar - ray of apparatus and chemical weapons now follows the enemy image of illness, microbes and dying. All of this is an expression of the search for the ideal, the perfect human being and immortality. Therapists are not taught in their training how one thing develops from the other, negatively in the process of disease and positively in the healing process. It is left up to the personal initiative of the therapists to explore the journey of illness and the organ - ism's laws of healing. In miasmatic holistic treatment, as I live and teach it, every illness leaves the organism through the skin. There is an absence of re - lapses or reoccurrences only when psora is healed. By using Sulfur or other psoric rem - edies such as Fagopyrum or Inachis to lead the chronic disease back to where it began in the real or spiritual sense, patients actually feel free, independent and strong. They gain confi - dence once again in being able to master their everyday life alone from that time on. Feeling good is not always enough as a sign of healing for the completed therapy. Patients already feel better much sooner than their entire organism 11 Prefa Ce to thIs volume can send the clear signals. The achieved heal- ing must show distinct signs that conscious - ness has changed and that patients can sense and verbalise this state. As soon as the skin is reached, one last touch - stone of the immune system must be crossed: How do I treat myself? Can I now differenti - ate between myself and others? Am I now liv - ing as an original and am I free of old copies? Taking these last steps in the transformation of consciousness is supported by psoric rem - edies. The physical skin can react, but must not necessarily do so. Y et, it is certain that the emotional and mental aspects of the skin will react and the conflict of the previously chronic disease will leave the organism through this former entrance portal. So it is not enough that the symptoms have disappeared, but to answer the question of where they have gone. What is more important is the process of transforma - tion in thinking, feeling and acting - which the physical organism follows with all of the self-healing programmes that are (still) avail - able. This is my favourite phrase: self-healing programmes. How much richer medical train - ing would be if people would study the self- healing programmes of human existence until they become second nature and choose them as a role model for healing. Modern society would save billions with this approach. But it does not want this. It wants the business with fear, illness and the symptom-masking pill. What a pity! The skin breathes, absorbs nutrients, has a metabolism and eliminates waste substanc - es. It is also called the \"third kidney\" or the \"third lung. \" The fundamental reactions of an intact immune system are manifested in that germs and other foreign substances are dilut -ed through sweating and \"burned\" by fever. When I think about how much effort ther - apists invest in getting people to once again sweat and have a fever, it becomes clear how deeply diseases can penetrate into the energy system without anything stopping them. On the other hand, having a fever and sweating in miasmatic therapy are good guarantees for a reawakened immune system that can differen - tiate between self and others - and do so right at the periphery. Anyone who has overcome a serious illness can \"afford\" a slight, acute ill - ness due to the reacquired ability to have a fever and sweat. Becoming ill is not a problem because it can happen to anyone. But when an illness refuses to go away, this is the sign of sycosis, a deeper miasmatic layer. Skin diseases due to insufficient hygiene tend to be rare in Western culture. Acne, which usu - ally appears during puberty, is experienced as bothersome and is very often suppressed. Y et, it would not take that much effort to adapt the diet of adolescents with somewhat less protein and carbohydrates so that it is more appropri - ate for their hormonal balance. But instead, the addiction to sugar is on the rise and fast food is trendy. Y oung people who become conscious of nutrition at an early age do not suffer from ugly pimples and skin reddened by acids. But even when pimples and signs of acidity appear in the face, it would be much better to signal to young people that there are natural meth - ods of healing by giving them Schuessler Salts (Nat-p, Nat-s or Kali-s) instead of suppressing the skin eruptions. A much greater emphasis is placed on impure skin than inner purity. Outer beauty is wor - shipped due to the cosmetics industry. I would like to include a significant example of this:12 Prefa Ce to thIs volume An artist who came to me for treatment spent two to three hours (!) every morning with body care, cosmetics, combing and dress - ing. Her problem was that even directly after washing, an unbearable smell clung to her. Deodorants or bathing, showering and wash - ing every day did not help. She had suffered tremendously for many years because of the emanations. The patient was an elegant, well- groomed and cultivated lady. She moved in an enviable light-footed way on high pumps and had a very good figure. Just the smell... The solution was so simple that the treatment almost seemed like a miracle. But it simply involved using the Chinese theory of corre - spondence, which classifies smells with the meridians and/or organs. Consequently, I used my nose diagnostically and discovered the typical repulsive-metallic smell that belongs to the lung-large intestine functional circuit. This functional circuit controls the \"defensive energy\" of the pores and the perspiration. It is responsible for the defence and resilience of the skin and controls the distribution of bodily fluids, as well as the moistening and cooling of the entire system. Rhythmic breathing exercises, intestinal res - toration and a change of diet to the food- combining diet, supplemented by the con - stitutional remedy Platinum 200C as a single dose - and the entire problem was resolved in six weeks. The lady had also received homeopathic remedies in the past, but the smell had remained. The body spoke clear - ly to communicate that its metabolism was too slow, the strain on the lymph was too intense and elimination was too sluggish. What could be more obvious than reactivat - ing the body functions?Unpleasant body odours are signs of inner impurities in the metabolism and organs of elimination. There is no cosmetic solution for this, just a physical one that starts on the inside and works towards the outside up to the skin. This last volume deals with the outer skin, the layers of the skin, the connective tissue and the lymphatic system. How they are related to each other is illuminating for the holistic un - derstanding of skin diseases. Considering the skin from a spiritual perspective expands the horizon for the transformation of conscious - ness, which is necessary for healing. In every holistic perspective of illness and healing, the same laws of nature are always evident: Illness comes from the outside and moves towards the inside. The skin, nose and mouth are the most important entry por - tals for foreign substances, which activate the immune system. Healing moves from the inside to the out - side. First the consciousness must change, then the physical body follows. Illness wanders in a wave-like movement from above to below and then back up again. The respiratory organs first suffer from mucous congestion, then the strain wanders to the metabolic organs. Healing occurs from above to below. The head, neck and respiration must first be - come clear again. This is why deacidifica - tion and decongestion are so important. Illness develops from the lighter to the heavier levels, from the skin and hollow organs to the vital organs. Healing develops from the heavier to the next lighter level, away from the vital or - gans to the hollow organs up to the skin.13 Prefa Ce to thIs volume Illness manifests due to a certain unre - solved conflict at a certain organ location. Mind and matter form a logical unit. Healing is conflict resolution at precisely the organ location where the illness has manifested. Matter follows the transformation of con - sciousness. The consciousness of patients is only transformed through their own expe - riencing and the possibility of having new experiences. I see the task of the therapist as not only providing patients with healing in - formation of a material or energetic type and calming them down but also challenging them through a holistic treatment concept. Ther - apists are the companions who can enthuse patients for their own healing. In order to do this, therapists must first use their own creativ -ity. Only then can the spark jump across and inspire their patients. This is also exactly what goes under the skin in the circle of colleagues who work in the holistic-miasmatic manner when patients report \"live\" on how valiantly they looked at their own conflict and have re - solved it; despite all of the efforts, the lows and the highs, the therapists were able to enthuse them for their miasmatic process. I hope that this spark of inspiration also jumps across to the colleagues who read this volume. My source of inspiration and learning was a path through our garden this time. It is accom - panied by pearls of wisdom from the Shinjin - mei, a work from the 5th century in China that is unsurpassable for understanding of holism and methods of healing. It once served the Zen monks as the basis of meditation.55 4. C onflIC ts of the skIn and theIr homeo Path IC treatment not yet be destructive, but it is not easy for these patients to look the issue of the shadow in the eye and recognise where and how they have dis-integrated and isolated themselves. In order for healing to occur, they have no choice but to work through the conflict and once again integrate themselves into the great - er whole of nature and find their place in life that is free of sycotic exaggeration, feigning and facades. Subcutis (Subcutaneous Tissue) Whatever gets under the skin penetrates deep - ly into human beings. This involves the issue of self-esteem. The conflict is the experience of devaluation or degradation. A typical devalua - tion theme after the Second World War was the stigmatisation of a mother with a child born out of wedlock with the term \"fallen woman. \" The subcutaneous tissue can also be associated with the theme of defilement - for example, in the case of a melanoma or basal cell carci - noma that has penetrated more deeply into the skin. This is generally an archaic defilement conflict that has penetrated deeply in a family system and one of the descendants. The mela - noma also serves as a protective shield against physical and psychological attacks that people must endure in both private and professional life and believe that they cannot defend them - selves against them. This involves real experiences rather than de - lusions or imagination. The tissue is destroyed or dissolved. This is a destructive process; seen in miasmatic terms, it belongs to the syphiline or carcinogenous. Wherever tissue has been destroyed in conflict activity, the building of tissue also occurs again in the healing phase. In terms of its surface, the skin is a large organ system with various fields of expression and correlations. Many reflex zones also establish contact between the outer and inner processes and states. A very general approach differenti - ates between the following relationships: If outer areas of the body such as the back, shinbone, backs of the hands and elbows are affected, the message of the conflict is: I would like to separate from someone, put someone off or avoid someone's touch, but I cannot manage to do so. If inner areas of the body such as the backs of the knees, insides of the elbows, palms of the hands, chest, belly and groins are affected, the message of the conflict is: I have been separated from someone and suffer because I am not (no longer) touched. If the face is affected, the message of the conflict is: I am being rejected; someone does not want me. The following section is a look at well-known skin diseases that as experience has shown are not easy to treat when their conflicts have not been resolved. Homeopathy has an almost in - exhaustible number of options to offer here and takes into consideration both the patient's psychogram, the miasmatic basis and the pre - cursor diseases that lead to severe skin dis - eases. 4.1 Neurodermatitis (Atopic Eczema) This disease is not a local affliction but a se - rious disorder of the life force that becomes visible on the skin. Even in conventional medi - cine, it is clear that neurodermatitis (atopic eczema) is not conceivable without an inner cause. The disease often appears between the 56 4. C onflIC ts of the skIn and theIr homeo Path IC treatment 1st and 6th year of life as cradle cap. Sym - metrical, episodical skin changes occur later: reddened, intensely itching thickened areas of skin on the elbows, in the crook of the arm and knee and in the head and throat region. The symptoms indicate the miasmatic basis as being scrofulous, but there is a strong relation - ship to the carcinogenous as a correspondence. Healing begins in this deep layer since the he - reditary strain plays a major role because: Neurodermatitis has a serious separation conflict behind it. It can be inherited so that children already suffer from a serious neuro - dermatitis shortly after their birth. The trig - ger can be an actual change of location that the mother or both parents were forced to or wanted to make during the pregnancy. In the wider sense, the separation may also mean that mother or father suppressed many skin symptoms in their own life because they were repulsed by impure skin. Many vaccinations weaken the immune system. This weakness may show up on the skin of the child instead of the parents. Family Constellations work is generally necessary in the case of neuroder - matitis. The skin has an ectodermal origin and reacts - as mentioned above - with the loss of tissue in conflict activity. Patients are allergic to all possible foods, which then must be elimi - nated from their everyday life. Frequent doses of cortisone are prescribed, which then further intensify the conflict because the theme of cor - tisone is subjugation. Skin issues always include the immune system and its power to differentiate between the self and others. Nature only allows for subjugation in the case of a fight. In neurodermatitis, the fight is hopeless because healing does not oc - cur by eliminating foods or taking cortisone. A treatment is successful when patients can finally have a fever and sweat again. Conse - quently, therapy must be conducted through the long path of the destructive carcinogenous layers of the illness through the sycosis and often also through the scrofulous to the psora in order for it to actually leave the organism through the skin. This does not work without conflict resolution in the family system, espe - cially when children are affected. Some parents prefer to bear the disaster of their child's ill - ness instead of recognising the conflicts that are active within them and manifested by the child. On the other hand, it is almost a miracle to experience how successfully neuroderma - titis can be healed when everyone involved is insightful and solution-oriented.

The skin changes show an increased cir - culation and clearly defined round red spots that are covered with silvery white scales. The typical scaly papules develop in the later stag - es. If they are scraped away, the thin skin layers below them become visible and quickly bleed when they are manipulated.There is a double separation conflict behind psoriasis in that the active phase expresses itself in scales and the biological attempt to heal in the red areas. Both occur in the same organic place: elbows, knees, sacrum and margins of the hair. The reason for the separation is not under - stood and there are no existing or comprehen - sible arguments. They are no longer touched by the people who had previously caressed or touched them. These are often concealed sys - temic themes. In earlier times, psoriasis was a frequent disease in men with high economic 97 5. h olIstIC treatment of skIn dIseases Colour Primary: Stimulates and Tonifies Secondary: Inhibits and Sedates Green Formation of cell tissue and elimination of dead cellsTumours, ulcers and scrofulous tissue Turquoise Green Skin cells and loose skin Skin firmness and hardening nerves, as well as also having its strengths on the emotional level. Blue is the coldest colour and stands for en - durance and tenacity, which explains its rela - tionship to all chronic states. It has its strongest effect on the mental level. Here are the three most important secondary colours of green, orange and violet: Green is a mixture of the cold blue and the hot yellow. So green stands in the middle be - tween these two extremes and develops from this tension of the greatest growth force in na - ture. Growth is only possible where nourish - ment is absorbed - no matter whether this is air, light or material food. Green is therefore associated with the vegetative nervous system, the metabolism of the liver and the diet. It has a balancing, distributing and harmonising ef - fect; it is an ideal healing colour for all of the senses. Just like the eyes enjoy the rich green of the forests, fields, meadows and hills, green light serves as a light simile for eye diseases and weak vision. When exposed to green light, relaxation oc - curs almost immediately, but the special aspect is that this harmonising occurs in a gentle way. But green light should only just be applied for a brief time since it elevates the nitrogen content of cells and triggers apoptosis. This is desired in cancer therapy because degenerated and/or inadequately differentiated cells are eliminated The experience with colour light makes it pos - sible to recognise some laws, which are also reflected in these two tables: 1. Colours stimulate a stagnated state. 2. Colours inhibit excessive movement. 3. Colours avert a slowing movement. 4. Colours have an effect on the physical, emotional and mental level. The three basic colours of red, yellow and blue stand out in colour light therapy: Red has the greatest penetrating power and depth effect. As a result, red is always used on the physical level for basic functions of an organism; this means that it is related to the blood and the organs of conception. On the emotional level, it is only used when the \"spirits\" or vital forces are threatening to ex - tinguish. Just like red in nature and human society is a signal colour that indicates alarm, danger or a state of emergency, red light is also meaningful in the healing arts for acute states or when the body requires support for elimi - nating foreign substances. Y ellow is the hottest colour with the greatest radiance; although it does not penetrate very deeply, it spreads extensively. Its \"scattering effect\" becomes clear in visual terms through its associations: the central nervous system and respiratory system. Y ellow reaches even the finest branching of the bronchial tubes and 98 5. h olIstIC treatment of skIn dIseases by the immunocompetent cells as a result. But if green light is applied for too long, healthy cells may also be attacked. Orange is a mixture of yellow and red. After a colour light therapy with 15 to 30 minutes of green light exposure, a subsequent 30 to 60 minutes of orange radiation is ideal. It stimu - lates the immune system and hormonal system (organ light). For example, this can be useful after surgery. Not only do patients wake up from the anaesthesia without shock, the two colours help reduce surgery trauma, activate the forces of self-healing and promote the healing of wounds. Violet is another important secondary col - our and is created from the merging of red and blue. There are also strong contrasts here, but they achieve their very own character and effect in the colour gradations of blue or red violet. Violet light is ideal for all unclear psy - chosomatic disease processes, especially for nervous disorders with depression, as well as in the combination of restlessness and depres - sion. The individual patient states determine whether a red violet should be selected in or - der to strengthen the emotional condition and give the energy field more \"firmness\" in the sense of gathering strength or the violet blue in order to send a first \"ray of warmth\" into a deep depression. My experience has shown that in cases of major sadness and apathy, the violet blue is much better and has a gentler effect as the first colour impulse than when yellow or red are used right away.5.2 Detoxification with Colour Light and Phytotherapeutic Remedies A major topic in the treatment of chronic dis - eases is the strain due to electro smog, envi - ronmental toxins and pesticides. According to previous observations, it appears to me that a terrain clarification must frequently occur before a healing measure will bear fruit. The level of electro smog can no longer be rolled back because increasingly more transmitter masts for wireless telephone communication are being installed and their radiated beams are impeding the energetics of humans, fauna and flora. It has become a wired and wireless world and this development is difficult to stop because it has practical advantages. This means that human beings need a constantly increas - ing tolerance for storing toxins in the meta - bolic processes and tissue. One of the conse - quences of this environmental pollution is skin allergies. As already mentioned, colours are effective on two levels. They can stimulate organs to improve their functions or calm them in their work. The most important colour for this bi - lateral effect is green light since it has an out - standing detoxification effect through the skin, even in the severest poisoning with arsenic, lead and insecticides. It decongests the res - piratory organs, helps remove cancer cells and retunes the metabolism in cases of chronic dis - ease. The liver and kidneys are the organs that are most overwhelmed by a high level of toxins in the organism. The following plant remedies have proven to be successful in supporting the detoxification "}
