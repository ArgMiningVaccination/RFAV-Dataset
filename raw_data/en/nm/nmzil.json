I had previously had excellent results from Acupuncture while living in San Diego, and was looking for a new place to go in Atlanta. I selected Michael Sakowich since he has over 18 years of acupuncture experience. His compassion and love of his job really shine through. He conducted an extremely thorough review to understand my current issues and to critically think of root causes. I had been suffering from pneumonia for the last 2 weeks, and my nose and lungs started to drain within 10 minutes of him inserting the acupuncture needles. I feel amazing and almost completely recovered just 24 hours after the procedure. As an added bonus, the AOH manager, called the next day to check-in on my experience. This is truly awesome customer service. Highly recommend! Written May 26, 2023 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
