Dr. Monica Dayanand is a Doctor of Chinese Medicine, a licensed acupuncturist, a women's health and fertility specialist, and a certified postpartum doula. Monica feels a deep-rooted calling to help couples, and in particular, women and their babies during the most special and vulnerable times of their lives because she recognizes that women and children sometimes bear the brunt of the lack of efficient resources in our current system of healthcare, yet Chinese Medicine has so much to offer new moms and their newborns. New mothers need time at home to rest in order to recover from childirth, whether they had a vaginal delivery or a cesarian section (c-section). Ideally, post-birth mothers will be able to rest at home and receive several healing treatments from Dr. Monica. These healing sessions include two \"Mother Roasting\" moxa sessions (acupuncture and moxibustion), an infant wellness massage, a \"Closing the Bones\" ceremony with aromatherapy, and nutritional and herbal support and recommendations. Mother Roasting (with moxibustion): Moxibustion is a type of healing therapy that has been use in Chinese Medicine for centuries. The therapy uses a traditional Chinese medicinal herb that can come in varying forms depending on how the practitioner plans to apply it, but usually a tightly rolled stick of mugwort herb is lit on fire and begins to slowly smolder. The hot end of the moxibustion stick is then held over a specific acupuncture point to warm the area. Moxibustion's warming healing properties that are especially important in the postpartum period to move blood (prevent clotting and treat pain), facilitate recovery, and dispel pain and discomfort, all while gently encouraging the uterus to return to its original size. \"Closing the Bones\" Ceremony: After the birth of a baby, it is paramount to help encourage the pelvic bones to return back to their normal width. If not, mothers will commonly suffer pelvic instability and leak qi, or lose energy, which could cause major health issues down the road. This ceremony is just as it sounds, and the new mama will be gently swaddled with appropriate essential oils diffusing from relaxation and healing. Infant Wellness Massage: Infant massage is a delightful and meaningful way to physiologically and pyschologically bond with your baby. Evidence of the earliest infant massage dates back to ancient India. Both in Ayurvedic and Chinese Medicine, massage has been used as a way to enhance circulation, eliminate toxins, improve digestive function, and boost overall wellness and wellbeing. Over 100 studies confirm the wide range of massage benefits for common infant maladies from gas and colic to sleeping problems, and bonding with your baby through mindful touch on a regular basis. Infant massage has countless measurable benefits including relieving symptoms associated with traumatic birth, overall physical and emotional well-being, and increasing mental stimulation. Postpartum healing home visits are only offered to those in a 6 mile radius of Phoenix Rising Acupuncture in River Oaks. Dr. Monica serves River Oaks, Upper Kirby, The Houston Heights, Downtown, Uptown, and Memorial.
