Your immune system is your body's natural built-in defense system against microscopic invaders. Having a strong and well maintained immune system is the key to preventing and fighting off infections. Many factors cause an individual's immune system to become compromised. Prolonged stress, poor diet, nutritional deficiencies, and poor quality sleep. Signs of a weakened immune system include: frequent colds or infections, chronic fatigue, high stress levels, allergies, chronic digestive issues, and slow-healing wounds. Fortunately, there are many steps you can take to boost your immune system naturally. Sleep is important Poor sleep quality or lack of sleep can lead to a series of health problems including a compromised immune system. If you feel you are not getting the recommended 7-8 hours of sleep per night (or 10 hours per night for children and teenagers). Here are some options you can try: sleep train yourself to go to bed and wake up the same time everyday, even if you don't \"need\" to be up. Take a nightly walk after dinner, watching a sunset actually helps the production of melatonin (sleep chemical) in the brain to help you fall asleep and stay asleep through the night. Avoid sugar or caffeine within 8 hours of your set time to sleep instead try drinking herbal tea before bed, chamomile, lavender, and peppermint are proven to provide a more restful night's sleep. Eat a Healthy Diet A poor diet can lead to a number of health concerns including nutritional deficiencies, disease and a compromised immune system. Processed foods and foods containing high amounts of unnatural sugars are the top contributors to a poor diet and compromised immune system. The body does not recognize these foreign foods filled with chemicals, food coloring, and preservatives. The body in response suffers from multiple adverse reactions such as weight gain, inflammation, and even autoimmune disorders. When looking to improve your diet to support your immune system consider whole foods containing the following vitamins and minerals: zinc, vitamin D and vitamin C. Avoid High Amounts Stress Did you know that stress can weaken your immune system? Individuals can even developed common psychosomatic symptoms such and pain in their shoulders, neck and backs. While living a life completely free from stress is next to impossible there are many helpful strategies and practices to help you reduce and manage your stress levels. Start by identifying the activities in your life that bring you joy and the activities that cause you the most stress. Are you giving both activities in your life equal attention? If not, what small goals could you set to help restore a sense of balance in your life. Ensuring you have time for the activities that bring you joy and a sense of relaxation are essential to managing your stress and boosting your immune system.
