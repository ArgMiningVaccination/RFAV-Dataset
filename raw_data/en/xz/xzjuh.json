It reduces the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatment of infectious diseases in humans and animals thereby leading to increased morbidity and mortality, as well as higher costs. It is well established that there is a strong association between the usage of antimicrobial agents and the occurrence of resistance. The selective pressure exerted following use of antimicrobial agents is a key issue in the epidemiology of resistance. In this report the term antimicrobial resistance is used synonymously with antibiotic resistance, although the term actually includes resistance in other microbes as well. Antimicrobial resistance can be disseminated through the spread of resistant pathogenic organisms themselves or by horizontal transfer of resistance genes from one type of organisms to another. Such transfer is not limited to closely related organisms; it can also take place between organisms of different evolutionary origins and/or ecological niches. Thus, antimicrobial drug usage and resistance in one ecological compartment can have consequences for the occurrence of resistance in another compartment. When addressing antimicrobial resistance - the occurrences, causes, consequences and preventive measures - a holistic approach is needed, encompassing both data on usage and resistance in human and veterinary medicine, as well as organisms in the food production chain. In response to the growing concern about antimicrobial resistance, the Norwegian Ministry of Health and Social Affairs issued a national action plan against antimicrobial resistance in March 2000. The importance of monitoring the human and animal health sectors as well as food production, was emphasised. The action plan recognised the need for ongoing surveillance as a fundamental component of the strategy. The NORM and NORM-VET programmes were consequently established in order to provide and present data on the occurrence and distribution of antimicrobial resistance over time. The national action plan formally expired by the end of 2004. However, the need for continued surveillance of both resistance and antimicrobial usage was emphasised at subsequent consultations and an integrated national strategy for prevention of infections in the health service and antibiotic resistance (2008-2012) was issued in the summer of 2008. Following the renewed effort of the WHO in recent years, the Norwegian government launched a new national strategy (2015-2020) in June 2015 including an explicit target of 30% reduction in antibiotic consumption in human medicine by 2020 compared to 2012. For food-producing terrestrial animals and companion animals the target was 10% and 30% reduction in the usage, respectively, by 2020, with 2013 as reference year. Additional specific targets in the food production chain are that livestock associated MRSA will not be established in the Norwegian pig population, and that ESBL in the poultry production will be reduced to a minimum. Mapping of reservoirs of antimicrobial resistant bacteria will also be carried out in the most relevant animal populations and plants important to food safety. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the expiry of this strategy has been postponed until 2021, but the government has initiated the process to develop a new framework for the coming years. The NORM surveillance programme for antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens was established in 1999 and is coordinated by the Department of Microbiology and Infection Control at the University Hospital of North Norway in Troms\u00f8. The NORM-VET monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance in animals, food and feed was established in 2000 and is coordinated by the Norwegian Veterinary Institute commissioned by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority. The NORM/NORM- VET reports also present data on the usage of antimicrobial agents in humans and animals in Norway. The NORM and NORM-VET programmes are valuable tools for setting policies, assessing risks and evaluating interventions. This report, which is the twenty-first annual joint report from NORM and NORM-VET, presents data on resistance and usage for 2020. The editors would like to thank all those who contributed to data collection and the writing of this report, for excellent work.

NORM / NORM-VET 2020 SUMMARY 11SUMMARY This joint report from the surveillance programme for antimicrobial resistance in human pathogens (NORM) and the monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from feed, food and animals (NORM-VET) presents data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance and the usage of antimicrobial agents in humans and animals for the year 2020. The NORM and NORM-VET programmes were established as part of the Norwegian Government's Action Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance issued in 2000. NORM is coordinated by the Department of Microbiology and Infection Control, University Hospital of North Norway, Troms\u00f8. NORM- VET is coordinated by the Norwegian Veterinary Institute. Usage of antimicrobial agents in animals The total sales of antibacterial veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) for terrestrial animals in Norway were 5,019 kg antibacterial ingredients in 2020, which is at the same level as in 2019. Sales of antibacterial VMPs for use in terrestrial food- producing animals, including horses, were 4,659 kg in 2020. Penicillins continued to be the most-selling antibacterial class for the major species - i.e. cattle, pigs, goats, sheep and poultry - and were almost exclusively accounted for by beta-lactamase sensitive penicillins. From 2013-2019, the estimated sales of antibacterial VMPs for cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep and goats declined by 23% when measured in kg and 18% when measured in mg/PCU (population correction unit). For horses, the usage was mainly accounted for by trimethoprim-sulfa (oral paste). The sales (kg) of antibacterial VMPs for group treatment of terrestrial food-producing animals in Norway continued to be very low; in 2020 such products accounted for only 3.6% of the total sales. In 2020, the sales (kg) of antibacterial VMPs for farmed fish (cleaner fish included) were 223 kg. This is a reduction of more than 99% compared to 1987, when the sales were at its highest. For Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, fish in only 0.8% of the on-grower locations were subjected to antibacterial treatment in 2020. The sales (kg) of antibacterial VMPs marketed for companion animals were 360 kg in 2020. From 2013-2020 the sales of such VMPs for use in companion animals have been reduced by 32%. The prescriptions of human anti- bacterial medicinal products reported to the Veterinary Prescription Register declined gradually by 21% (kg) from 2015-2020. This indicates that the decline in the sales of antibacterial VMPs for companion animals has not been substitutet by prescribing of human products. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has suggested to restrict the use of some antibacterial classes in animals due to the potential risk to public health, including 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins, quinolones (fluoroquinolones and other quinolones) and polymyxins. In Norway, only quinolones are sold for food-producing terrestrial animals and farmed fish. The proportion sold of quinolones of the total sales of antibacterial VMPs was very low and was mainly accounted for by sales for use in farmed fish. In February 2015, the Norwegian poultry industry launched a project aiming at phasing out use of narasin as coccidiostat feed additive in broilers, a goal that was reached in June 2016. The usage of therapeutic antibiotics for broilers continues to be very low in 2020, only two broiler flocks were subjected to one such treatment each and only beta-lactamase sensitive penicillins were used. Usage of antimicrobial agents in humans In 2020, the total sales of antibacterial agents for systemic use in humans (J01 excl. methenamine) were 11.5 defined daily doses (DDD)/1,000 inhabitants/day. Since 2012 there has been a marked decline in total antibiotic use, a reduction of 32%. During the Covid-19 pandemic a significant reduction in the use of systemic antibiotics has been observed, mainly due to reduced use of antibiotics indicated for respiratory tract infections in primary care. Infection control measures may have decreased the incidence of infections, moreover, the threshold for seeing a general practitioner for symptoms of infections has been raised. Around 84% of the total human sales of antibacterials are used in primary care, i.e. outside healthcare institutions. For ambulatory care, the most important antibiotic group in 2020 was penicillins (J01C); 37% of DDD and 52% of prescriptions J01 excl. methenamine, followed by tetracyclines J01A (19%). The three most commonly prescribed antibiotics for outpatients in 2020 were phenoxymethylpenicillin, pivmecillinam and doxy- cycline. These three substances represented 49% of all prescriptions and 52% of all DDD sold. In Norway, the main indication for narrow-spectrum penicillins in primary care is respiratory tract infections, and in 2020 the proportion of narrow-spectrum penicillins (J01CE) was reduced and accounted for excl. methenamine). The urinary antiseptic all DDD in the antibacterial J01 group. The steady decreased use in primary care over the latest years may be due to increased attention towards antimicrobial resistance, both among the general public and health professionals. A large proportion of general practitioners have completed quality improvement courses after the introduction of the Government's Action Plan against AMR in 2016. Although a lot has been achieved there are probably still areas of improvement, e.g. in individualisation of doses or duration of course length and choice of antibiotics. One should therefore expect that it is possible to achieve a further lowering of consumption rate and a better narrow-spectrum profile. In 2020, the antibacterial sales (in DDD) to hospitals represented 8% of total sales of antibacterials for human use in the country. There has been a decrease of 11% in DDD/1,000 inhibitants/day compared to 2019. The hospitals restructured their departments and postponed elective surgery as preparation for the expected high numbers of patients with severe Covid-19 disease. This resulted in fewer admissions and fewer bed days as most hospitals turned out to actually have surplus capacity. In 2020, a mean use of 76 DDD/100 bed days was observed, an increase of 14% since 2012. The DDD/admission (2020; 3.1 DDD/admission) increased by 1% in the same period. The therapy pattern of antibacterials in hospitals does not SUMMARY NORM / NORM-VET 2020 12 change much from one year to another but there is a clear trend towards more use of antibiotics recommended in national guidelines. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics was reduced by 20% compared to 2012 (measured in DDD/100 bed days). In hospitals, around half of the use, measured in DDD, is penicillins (J01C). The second largest group is the cephalosporins with 20% of all DDD. There are large variations between the hospitals in volume of antibiotics used, measured in DDD/100 bed days, and in therapy profile. The variations cannot be accounted for by differences in activity or patient populations alone. Resistance in animal clinical isolates The clinical isolates included in NORM-VET 2020 were Klebsiella pneumoniae from infections in various animal species (n=74) and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in pigs (n=83). In total, 86.5% of the K. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents included in the susceptibility testing. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was detected in four (5.4%) of the isolates. One of these MDR isolates was resistant to seven antimicrobial classes and two isolates were resistant to five antimicrobial classes. Two of them displayed resistance to the extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) cefotaxime and ceftazidime due to presence of the blaCTX-M-15 gene. Both isolates were from clinical infections in dogs. This is the first time A. pleuropneumoniae has been included in NORM-VET. The antibiotic concentration ranges for several of the substances tested for were too narrow to define epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) based on the available distributions. Therefore, the true occurrence of resistance could not be determined. Among the antimicrobial agents where occurrence of resistance could be determined, the most commonly detected resistances were to the amphenicol florfenicol and the quinolones dano-floxacin and enrofloxacin. Resistance in indicator bacteria from animals and food The 2020 data confirm that the situation regarding antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from animals and food in Norway is good. The occurrence of multi-drug resistance (MDR), i.e. resistance to three or more antimicrobial classes, and specific emerging resistant bacteria/ mechanisms such as E. coli resistant to ESC, are low. Carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have never been isolated in samples from animals or food in Norway. This still applies for the 2020 results. NORM-VET is following the requirements set in EU Commission Implementing Decision of 12. Nov 2013 on the monitoring and reporting of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and commensal bacteria (2013/652/EU). In addition, samples from sources that this legal act does not cover may also be included. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. are used as indicator bacteria, i.e. susceptibility testing of E. coli and Enterococcus spp. is used as an indicator for occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in the bacterial population. Selective methods are used to investigate the occurrences of E. coli resistant to ESC, CRE, and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE). Some antimicrobials are defined by WHO as critically important for treatment of human infections. A significant reservoir of such resistant bacteria in animals and the food production chain is of concern as they may interact with the human bacterial population and thus have an impact on resistance development in these. In 2020, animal samples included caecal samples from broiler and turkey flocks for susceptibility testing of E. coli and Enterococcus spp., and detection of emerging resistant bacteria/resistance mechanisms such as ESC resistant E. coli, CRE and VRE. Food samples consisted of meat from broilers. In samples from broiler flocks, the majority (79.8%) of the E. coli (n=247) were fully susceptible to the antimicrobial classes in the test panel, and only 0.4% were MDR. The number of fully susceptible isolates has been relatively stable around 80% the last years (2014-2020). There has, however, been a statistically significant increase in resistance to quinolones (i.e. ciprofloxacin and/or nalidixic acid) from 3.4% in 2014 to 12.6% in 2020. ESC resistant E. coli were found in only one of the broiler caecal samples and in three (0.9%) of the broiler meat samples, and all were due to presence of the blaCMY-2 gene. This is in concordance with the results from 2018, and confirms that the measures implemented by the industry to reduce the occurrence of ESC resistant E. coli in broilers have been successful. Full susceptibility to all antimicrobial classes included in the test panel was present in 31.0% of the Enterococcus faecalis (n=87) and Enterococcus faecium isolates from broilers. None of the isolates were MDR. Compared to the data from 2018, there has been a significant increase in occurrence of tetracycline resistance among E. faecalis isolates from 36.7% to 66.7%. However, the occurrence in 2014 was more similar to 2020, and further monitoring is needed to follow this in the years to come. A significant decrease in occurrence of narasin resistance was detected in E. faecium from 24.7% in 2018 to 15.6% in 2020. A decrease was indicated in E. faecalis as well. This decrease in occurrence of narasin resistance was expected as the use of narasin as coccidiostat to broilers was phased out in Norway in 2015-2016. Since then, Norwegian broilers have been raised without the use of coccidiostats, though some flocks are given narasin in cases of outbreaks (see chapter on usage in animals). No VRE were detected, and this is in concordance with the 2018 results. In turkey, the majority (75.2%) of the E. coli isolates (n=121) were fully susceptible to the antimicrobial agents in the test panel, and this seems to have been relatively stable over the last years (i.e. 2016-2020). Altogether, 4.9% of the isolates were MDR. ESC resistant E. coli were found in nine (7.4%) of the turkey caecal samples. All were due to chromosomal mutations. A total of 54.2% of E. faecalis (n=24) and 61.7% of E. faecium (n=115) isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial classes included in the test panel. MDR was detected in 0.9% of E. faecium isolates. The occurrence of narasin resistance in E. faecium from turkey was 78.3%, and in concordance with the 2018 result. Narasin has never been used in the turkey production, and the reason behind this occurrence is unknown. No VRE were detected, and this is in concordance with the 2018 results. NORM / NORM-VET 2020 SUMMARY 13Resistance in zoonotic bacteria and non- zoonotic enteropathogenic bacteria Animal isolates The Norwegian population of production animals is considered virtually free from Salmonella spp. In 2020, a total of 33 Salmonella spp. isolates from animals were susceptibility tested. In total, 23 of these isolates were S. Typhimurium and included one each from eight cats, five wild boars, four cattle, four dogs, one pig and one chicken, respectively. The remaining ten isolates belonged to eight different serovars. Nine of the isolates were fully susceptible to all antimicrobial classes tested for. Twenty isolates showed reduced susceptibility to colistin (MIC>2). However, no acquired resistance genes nor point mutations were found, and due to differences in natural susceptibility to colistin among serovars, these were regarded as susceptible to colistin. MDR was detected in three S. Typhimurium isolates. Campylobacter spp. from both broiler and turkey flocks were included in 2020. Only a few isolates of C. coli were detected, i.e. four from broiler and one from turkey, and streptomycin resistance was detected in one of the broiler isolates. From turkey, only five C. jejuni isolates were detected, of which one was resistant to streptomycin. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among C. jejuni isolates from broilers is low. In total, 90.8% of the 87 C. jejuni isolates from broilers tested were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents included in the test panel. Resistance to quinolones were most common, followed by resistance to streptomycins. None of the isolates were MDR. Human clinical enteropathogenic isolates Following the reorganisation of the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for Enteropathogenic Bacteria at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) and the paused antimicrobial susceptibility testing for 2018, the NRL resumed antimicrobial susceptibility testing for enteropathogenic bacteria in 2019. From 2020 onwards, all Enterobacterales isolates received at the NRL are subjected to genotypic resistance screening. For Salmonella Typhimurium and its monophasic variant, overall resistance levels were higher for travel-associated strains compared to domestically acquired strains. Antibiotic resistance was highest among Salmonella Typhi, with an observed increasing trend for resistance against extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was also a characteristic trait for a considerable propotion of the S. Typhi isolates (42.9%). Seven Salmonella isolates were characterised as ESBL producers and all were genotyped as blaCTX-M. Fluoroquinolone resistance in Salmonella was mostly attributed to known mutations in gyrA. For Campylobacter jejuni , overall resistance rates for ciprofloxacin and tetracycline were higher for travel- associated strains compared to strains domestically acquired. An increasing trend of resistance towards ciprofloxacin was observed in Shigella sonnei and also an increasing trend of resistance towards extended-spectrum cephalosporin in Shigella flexneri. Five Shigella spp. as ESBL A producers encoding blaCTX-M-15. Antimicrobial resistance rates in Yersinia enterocolitica remain low. Resistance in human clinical isolates The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in human clinical isolates was still low in Norway in 2020. Only 19 methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) blood culture isolates were detected among 1,367 strains included in NORM 2020 (1.4%). During 2020, the total number of systemic S. aureus isolates from blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluids was 1,993 including 35 MRSA strains (1.8%). This is an increase from 0.9% in 2019. The Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS) registered 734 cases of MRSA infections in 2020 compared to 905 in 2018 and 945 in 2019. The majority of MRSA cases were reported as superficial wound infections and/or abscesses. The proportion of MRSA among non-invasive S. aureus isolates is still very low at 1.8% (18/1,005) and comparable to previous years (1.7% in in 2019). Furthermore, MSIS registered colonisations compared to 1,631 in 2018 and 1,499 in 2019. A total of 1,882 persons were reported with MRSA in 2020, corresponding to an incidence rate of 35/100,000 person years (46/100,000 in 2019). The monthly number of MRSA infections has not changed significantly over the last seven years, and the incidence of invasive disease has remained stable at a low level. The annual number of colonised persons reached a peak in 2017, and has declined significantly in the last three years. A large proportion of cases are still infected abroad, but a steep reduction was noted in 2020 and was presumably due to reduced international travel. Very few cases of livestock-associated MRSA are detected. The rates of resistance to broad-spectrum antimicrobials in E. coli blood culture isolates remained essentially un- changed in 2020. The prevalence of gentamicin resistance increased slightly from 5.9% in 2019 to 6.7% in 2020, while the prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance remained stable at 11.2% compared to 11.3% in 2019. Klebsiella spp. isolates now demonstrate approximately the same rates of resistance to gentamicin (5.2%) and ciprofloxacin (8.1%) as E. coli. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) have emerged as a significant clinical problem in many countries, including Norway. A total of 136/2,087 (6.5%) E. coli and 70/967 (7.2%) Klebsiella spp. blood culture isolates were reported with this phenotype in 2020. The prevalence was at the same level as in previous years for both E. coli (6.5% in 2018; 7.1% in 2019) and Klebsiella spp. 2018; 5.7% in 2019). The proportion of ESBL positive isolates is still higher among E. coli from blood cultures (6.5%) than in urinary tract isolates (3.4%). Colonisation and/or Acinetobacter MSIS since 2012. The number of CPE patients decreased from 75 in 2019 to 57 in 2020. The number of patients with carbapenemase-producing P. aeruginosa (n=4) remained stable, whereas Acinetobacter spp. notifications decreased from 23 in 2019 to 10 in 2020. The most probable expla- nation for this change is the dramatic reduction of inter- national travel due to the coronavirus pandemic, thus demonstrating the role of import for the epidemiology of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria in Norway. SUMMARY NORM / NORM-VET 2020 14 Surveillance of resistance in systemic isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis resumed at the reference laboratory at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) in 2020, but as for other respiratory tract pathogens, very few cases were diagnosed (n=43 and n=3, respectively). Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates (n=442) displayed resistance to penicillin G (21.9%), and only 2.7% were susceptible to standard dosage corresponding to the wildtype population. Ciprofloxacin resistance was detected in 54.8% of isolates. Five isolates (1.1%) were resistant to cefixime, but sensitive to ceftriaxone. All isolates remained susceptible to spectinomycin. No enterococcal blood culture isolates with clinically significant vancomycin resistance ( vanA or vanB) were detected in 2020. The prevalence of ampicillin resistance in E. faecium has stabilised around 70-80%. High-level in E. faecalis at 12.0% (13.6% in 2019) but increased to 43.8% in E. faecium (32.4% in 2019), thus the downward trend for aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci over the last decade was not continued. Almost all HLGR E. faecium isolates were also resistant to ampicillin. There were no linezolid resistant isolates (LRE) in the NORM surveillance programme in 2020. Both VRE and LRE should be reported to the national notification system (MSIS), and 75 VRE (204 in 2019) and 10 LRE (16 in 2019) were confirmed at the Reference Laboratory at K-res/UNN in 2020. One additional isolate was combined VRE and LRE. The prevalence of VRE varies over time due to outbreaks, whereas there is a gradually increasing number of LRE cases from one year to another. One may speculate that the significant reduction of VRE cases in 2020 was caused by reduced international travel and improved infection control practices in hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic. Surveillance of resistance in systemic isolates of Streptococcus (pneumococci) and Strepto- coccus pyogenes (beta-haemolytic group resumed at the reference laboratory at the NIPH in 2020. Only 1.7% of S. pneumoniae isolates from blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluids were resistant to penicillin G, but another 11.1% would require increased exposure to be susceptible to this agent. The I+R categories thus increased from 8.9% in 2018 to 12.8% in 2020. Eight isolates were also categorised as I for 3rd generation cephalosporins. The prevalence of macrolide resistance was 8.4% in 2020 compared to 6.0% in 2018. Respiratory tract S. pneumoniae isolates were generally more susceptible to penicillin G (91.4% S) compared to systemic isolates (87.2% S), but the prevalences of macrolide resistance were similar (9.8% and 8.4%, respectively). All Streptococcus pyogenes blood culture isolates were susceptible to penicillin G. The prevalence of erythromycin resistance (6.7%) is an increase from 2017 (4.2%). Systemic Streptococcus agalactiae isolates (beta-haemolytic group B streptococci) were similarly susceptible to penicillin G, but often resistant to erythromycin (25.5% in 2019; 19.5% in 2020) and tetracycline 75.2% in 2020). More than 900 anaerobic blod culture isolates were included in NORM 2020. Resistance to penicillin G was commony found, and for some bacterial species there were also significant prevalences of resistance to piperacillin- tazobactam and clindamycin. The reader is referred to the text for further details. A total of 160 patients with tuberculosis were reported to MSIS in 2020 and susceptibility test results were available from 139 of them. A single isolate (0.8%) was defined as multi-drug resistant (MDR) to both rifampicin and isoniazid (0.8%), whereas another isolate was only resistant to rifampicin (RR). Both patients acquired their infections in Asia. Susceptibility testing was performed on 195 Candida spp. blood culture isolates of nine different species from 185 unique patients. The most common species were C. albicans (n=129), C. glabrata (n=6). All C. albicans were susceptible to the substances examined with the exception of two echinocandin resistant isolates (both resistant to micafungin and one also to anidulafungin). Only single non- albicans isolates with acquired fluconazole resistance were detected, but as expected there was a high prevalence of resistance to azoles among C. glabrata . Precise species identification is essential to predict inherent resistance and select appropriate antifungal therapy. The results are in accordance with previous studies from Norway. Conclusion Antimicrobial resistance is still a limited problem among humans and food-producing animals in Norway. This reflects the low usage of antibacterial agents in human and veterinary medicine, a favourable usage pattern, as well as effective infection control measures. The data presented in this report show that strategies for containment of antimicrobial resistance have been successful both in the food-producing animal sector and in the healthcare sector. Continuous efforts and awareness rising are needed to preserve the favourable situation and ensure that antibacterials are effective when needed. The NORM/ NORM-VET report is vital in order to document the trends in antibiotic usage and occurrence of resistance in humans and animals, and to evaluate the effectiveness of inter- ventions.

NORM / NORM-VET 2020 USAGE IN ANIMALS 17USAGE OF ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS USAGE IN ANIMALS Kari Grave, Kari Olli Helgesen and Petter Hopp Sales data for 1993-2020 for antibacterial veterinary medicinal products (VMP) for terrestrial animal species obtained at wholesalers\u00b4 level, have been stratified into sales of antibacterial VMPs approved for terrestrial food- producing animals including horses and approved solely for companion animals, respectively (see Appendix 1). The data are based on sales to Norwegian pharmacies from medicine wholesalers of VMPs. This includes all pharma-ceutical formulations approved for food-producing terrestrial animals, including horses, and for companion animals as well as VMPs used on special permit (products approved in another European Economic Area (EEA) country). In addition, data obtained from the Veterinary Prescription Register (VetReg) have been used for some data analysis, including for supplementary information (see Appendix 1). Usage of veterinary antibacterial agents Overall, the sales in Norway of antibacterial veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) for therapeutic use in food- producing terrestrial animals, including horses, and companion animals in 2019 were 5,008 kg. A decline of the annual sales of such VMPs of 46% in the period 1993-2019 is observed (Figure 1). FIGURE 1. Total sales, in kg active substance, for food-producing terrestrial animals (including horses) and companion animals, of antibacterial veterinary medicinal products for therapeutic use in Norway in 1993-2020. Food-producing terrestrial animals, including horses In 2020 the sales, in kg active substance, of antibacterial VMPs for use in terrestrial food-producing animals, including horses, were 4,659 kg and compared to 1993 a decrease in the sales of such VMPs of 48% is observed (Figure 2). In total, 62% of the sales (kg) of antibacterial VMPs for this animal category contained penicillins only, of which 94% was accounted for by beta-lactamase sensitive penicillins (narrow-spectrum). Of the total sales to this animal category, 30% was accounted for by combination VMPs with trimethoprim-sulfa; of this combination 89% was sold as oral paste for horses. The proportion of sales of VMPs containing only penicillins for this animal category increased from 19% to 62% during the period 1993-2020. This is mainly due to reduced sales of injectable and intramammary combination VMPs of penicillins and aminoglycosides (dihydro- that have been gradually replaced by VMPs containing penicillins as the sole antibacterial agents. 01000200030004000500060007000800090001000011000 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2112 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020Food producing terrestrial animals (including horses) Companion animalskg USAGE IN ANIMALS NORM / NORM-VET 2020 18 FIGURE 2. Sales, in kg active substance, of antibacterial veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) for therapeutic use in food- producing terrestrial animals (including horses) in Norway in 1993-2020. In addition, minor amounts of amphenicols VMPs were sold in 2008-2020 (range 16-27 kg). Minor amounts of baquiloprim were sold annually in 1994-2000. Of the antibacterials for which restriction of use in animals is recommend at EU/EEA level due to potential public health risks - i.e. 3rd and 4th generation cephalonsporins, polymyxins and quinolones (fluoroquinolones and other quinolones) (1,2), only fluoroquinolones are marketed in Norway for food-producing terrestrial animals. From 1993 to 2020, the proportion of sales of fluoroquinolones for food-producing terrestrial animals has been very low and stable varying between 0.1% and 0.3% of the total sales (see also Figures 4-6). During 1993-2020 no VMPs containing 3rd and higher generations of cephalosporins have been approved for food-producing animals in Norway via national procedures. Two 3rd generation products have been approved via community procedures, but these are not marketed in Norway. Applications for special permits to use such VMPs marketed in other EEA countries for food-producing animals are normally not approved, an approval would only be given for specific animals if sensitivity testing precludes all other options. This is the case also for polymyxins (Tonje H\u00f8y, Norwegian Medicines Authority, personal communication). Glycopeptides are not allowed for food-producing animals in EU/EEA countries; this is the case also for carbapenems. In Norway, sales of antibacterial VMPs for treatment of food-producing terrestrial animals are dominated by pharmaceutical forms for treatment of individual animals (Figure 3) and primarily by injectables. This reflects that the livestock is characterised by small herds, but it can also partly be explained by therapeutic traditions. In 2020, only 3.6% of the sales of antibiotic VMPs for food-producing terrestrial animals were for VMPs for group treatment (oral treatment). FIGURE 3. Sales in Norway, in kg active substance, of antibacterial veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) marketed for treatment of individual food-producing terrestrial animals, including horses (bolus, injectables, intramammary preparations, intrauterine preparations, oral paste and some tablet VMP presentations - see Appendix 1) and for group treatment through feed or drinking water (oral solution and oral powder; no premixes are marketed for terrestrial food-producing animals). 010002000300040005000600070008000900010000 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020VMPs - for treatment individual animals VMPs - for group treatment NORM / NORM-VET 2020 USAGE IN ANIMALS 19Usage patterns - major terrestrial food-producing animals (VetReg data) The presented usage patterns represent the data reported to VetReg (see Appendix I) for 2020. The data were extracted from the VetReg database 2 March 2021. Of the reported amounts (kg) of antibacterial VMPs for cattle, pigs, sheep and goats, <0.5% was for goats and therefore data for this animal species are not presented. Of the amounts antibacterial VMPs and human medicinal products reported to VetReg for which EMA advice restriction of the use due to potential public health risks, the proportions acconted for by cattle, pigs and sheep were 0.2%, 0.1% and 0.03%, respectively, and of these only fluoroquinolones were used (Figure 4-6). Cattle Of the prescriptions (VetReg data) of antibacterial veterinary and human medicinal products for cattle in 2020, 89.4% was for penicillins (kg active substance); 87.6% was for beta-lactamase sensitive penicillins (intra-mammaries not included)) (Figure 4). This figure increased slightly from 2015-2020. Of the prescriptions of intramammaries reported to VetReg specifying animal species, 99% (kg) was for cattle. For intrammaries the sales data are used to document the prescribing patterns (see explanation Appendix I); the sales of intramammaries in kg active substance containing penicillins only were 79% in 2020 and for combinations of penicillins and aminoglycosides this figure was 21%. Measured in number of intramammary injectors sold in 2020, the corresponding figures were 89% and 11%, respectively. FIGURE 4.

These proportions were increasing slightly from 2015-2020. FIGURE 5. Prescribing patterns, in kg active substance, of antibacterial veterinary and human medicinal products for pigs in Norway in 2020.

Sheep Of the antibacterial veterinary and human medicinal products reported to VetReg as prescribed for treatment of sheep (Figure 6), 75.9% of the toal amount reported to VetReg was accounted for by penicillins, 75.1% was for beta-lactamase sensitive penicillins only (Figure 6). This proportion increased slightly from 2015-2020. FIGURE 6. Prescribing patterns, in kg active substance, of antibacterial veterinary and human medicinal products for sheep in Norway in 2020.

In addition, 0.017% of kg active 2020 USAGE IN ANIMALS 21Farmed fish In 2020, the total amount of antibacterials prescribed for use in aquaculture in Norway was 223 kg (Table 4); of this 207 kg were prescribed for farmed fish intended for human consumption (cleaner fish excluded). This usage was approximately at the same level as in 2015, 2016 and 2019. The amounts (kg) of antibacterials prescribed for farmed fish in 2017 and 2018 were somewhat increased compared to the previous and following years. This was not due to an increase in the number of treatments of farmed fish with antibacterials for these years as the number of prescriptions for 2015-2020 were 61, 63, 63, 43 45 and 48, respectively (Figure 7). The reason for the increase observed in the 2017 and 2018 data in prescriptions measured in kg active substance was that both in 2017 and 2018 a few sea farms with Atlantic salmon with high weights were subjected to treatment with antibiotics while in 2015, 2016, 2019 and 2020 antibiotics were not prescribed for such sea farms. Of the antibacterials for which restriction of use in animals is recommended at EU/EEA level due to potential public health risk (1, 2), only \"other quinolones\" are used for farmed fish. From 2011-2020, the proportion of sales of quinolones has fluctuated; in 2020 this proportion was 49% (115 kg) (Table 4). TABLE 4. Usage, in kg of active substance, of antibacterial veterinary medicinal products for farmed fish in Norway in 2011- 2020. For 2011-2012 the data represent sales data from feed mills and wholesalers collected by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health; for 2013-2020 data represent prescription data obtained from the Veterinary Prescription Register (See Appendix 1).

For the years 2013-2020, the major proportion of prescriptions was for farmed fish in the pre-ongrower phase (Figure 7). The number of prescriptions of antibacterial VMPs for Atlantic salmon ongrowers was negligible during the period 2013-2020, despite that Atlantic salmon represents more than 95% of the farmed fish produced in Norway and the total annual production of farmed fish has been above 1.2 million tonnes in the period. This is a strong indication that the vaccines used are efficient and that the coverage of vaccination of fingerlings is very high. FIGURE 7 .

Thus, the sales in mg/PCU have declined by 99.9% (Table 4). The significant decrease in the usage of antibacterial agents in Norwegian aquaculture from 1987 is mainly attributed to the introduction of effective vaccines against bacterial diseases in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout but also prevention of bacterial diseases and their spread. FIGURE 8. Sales, in tonnes of active substance, of antibacterial veterinary medicinal products for therapeutic use in farmed fish (including cleaner fish) in Norway in 1981-2020 versus tonnes produced (slaughtered) farmed fish. For the years 1981- 2012 the data represent sales data provided by Norwegian Institute of Public Health; for 2013-2020 data represent prescription data obtained form the Veterinary Prescription Register. Data on slaughtered biomass farmed fish were obtained from Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries (https://www.fiskeridir.no/Akvakultur/Tall-og-analyse/Akvakulturstatistikk-tidsserier). In a report from 2019 (3) it was shown that for Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, fish in only 1.5%, 1.4%, 1.0%, 0.6% and 0.8% of the ongrowers locations were subjected to treatment in the years 2013-2017, respectively. For 2018, 2019 and 2020 these figures were 1.6%, 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively. Companion animals (dogs and cats) The sales in 2020 of antibacterial VMPs approved solely for companion animals (includes VMPs formulated as tablets, oral solution, injectable and oral paste) were 360 kg; in 2019 this figure was 335 kg. As shown in Figure 9, a steady increase in the sales from 1993 to 2001 was observed. This can in part be explained by changes in the number of antibacterial VMPs marketed for dogs and cats during that period. When the availability of VMPs for dogs and cats was lower, antibacterial human medicinal products (HMPs) were likely prescribed for dogs and cats. In 1993, only eight antibacterial VMP presentations (name, pharmaceutical form, strength and pack size) were authorised in Norway for dogs and cats, while in 2001 the corresponding number was 36. The number of VMP presentations for dogs and cats amounted to 49 in 2015; in 2020 this figure had decreased to 30. 02004006008001000120014001600 0102030405060 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020Antibacterials sold (tonnes) Biomass produced farmed fish (1000 tonnes)Tonnes antibacterials 1000 tonnes produced NORM / NORM-VET 2020 USAGE IN ANIMALS 23 FIGURE 9. Sales, in kg active substance, of antibacterial veterinary medicinal products marketed solely for use in companion animals (injectables, oral paste, oral solution and tablets; note the exceptions for tablets: see Appendix 1) in Norway for the period 1993-2020. Minor sales of an injectable 3rd generation cephalosporin VMP 0.4-1.1. kg) of macrolide VMPs (0.4-5 kg) in 1996-2003 were observed. The sales patterns of antibacterial VMPs marketed solely for companion animals (dogs and cats) have changed significantly during the period 1993-2020 (Figure 9). The first penicillin VMP as tablets - i.e. amoxicillin (an amino- penicillin) was marketed for dogs and cats in 1994; since then the proportion belonging to the penicillins (only aminopenicillin VMPs marketed) sold of total sales of antibacterial VMPs approved for such animals has increased from 1% to 81% (Figure 9). In 1997, a VMP with amoxicillin in combination with clavulanic acid was marketed for dogs and cats and since then the proportion of the combination amoxicillin and clavulanic acid increased steadily (Figure 10) peaking in the period 2009-2012 accounting for 88% of the sales of aminopenicillins. Since then a minor decrease in this proportion is observed (Figure 10). FIGURE 10. Proportions of sales (in kg active substance), of amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid and of amoxicillin products for dogs and cats in Norway in 1994-2020. From 1993-2020 the proportion of sales of fluoro- quinolones has been very low, accounting for 0.5% of the total sales for this animal category in 1993 increasing to 2.8% in 2011 and since then this proportion has gradually decreased to 1.4% in 2020 (Figures 9 and 11). The pro-portion of the total sales for dogs and cats of 3rd generation cephalosporins has been low since such VMPs were marketed in Norway; this figure was 0.2% in 2008 and declined to 0.1% in 2020 (Figure 11). 0100200300400500600700 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Penicillins 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid Amoxicillin USAGE IN ANIMALS NORM / NORM-VET 2020 24 Antibacterials for which use in animals is adviced to be restricted In 2019, the Antimicrobial Advice Ad Hoc Expert Group (AMEG) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a categorisation (1, 2) of antibiotics for prudent and responsible use at EU/EEA level. For certain classes - i.e. quinolones (fluoroquinolones and other quinolones), 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins and polymyxins it is advised that the risk to public health resulting from veterinary use needs to be mitigated by specific restrictions. Figure 11 shows the amounts sold, in kg of the anti-bacterials belonging to the categories AMEG advices to restrict the use of, compared to the total sales of antibacterial VMPs, stratified by animal categories. In total, 1.5% of the sales of antibacterial VMPs were accounted for by the AMEG category adviced to restrict use and was primarily accounted for by use in farmed fish. Of note is that apart from one VMP for local ear treatment, other pharmaceutical forms of VMPs containing polymyxins are not marketed in Norway. FIGURE 11. Total sales and sales of antibacterial veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) in 2020, for which the Antimicrobial Advice Ad Hoc Expert Group (AMEG) of the European Medicines Agency advises to restrict the use, stratified by animal category (1, 2).

This target was reached already after two- three years (Figure 12). After five years the observed reduction was 40% and since then the usage for this animal category has been on approximately the same level - i.e. on average the sales for the period 1999-2012 was 39% lower than in 1995 (Figures 2 and 12). FIGURE 12. Changes in sales (kg active substance) in Norway of antibacterial veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) approved for use in food-producing terrestrial animals, including horses, 1995 being the reference year. Targets 2015 - 2020 Approach - assessment of changes To evaluate progress in terms of reaching the goals set down in the national strategy, sales data for 2013-2020 have been further refined in order to obtain estimates on the usage that are more accurate in terms of identifying changes across time by sector. Data on prescribing per animal species obtained from the Veterinary Prescription Register (VetReg) have been used as supportive information for this refinement 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012Reduction in sales (kg) of antibacterial VMPs for food-producing terrestrial animals including horses In 2015, a National Strategy against Antibiotic Resistance (2015-2020) was agreed upon. Among others, this strategy has set four targets for reduction of usage of antibacterials in terrestrial animals and farmed fish: 1. To reduce the usage of antibacterials in food-producing terrestrial animals by 10% by 2020, with 2013 as reference year. 2. In 2020, usage of antibacterials in farmed fish should be at the same level or lower than the average for the period 2004-2014. 3. To reduce the usage of antibacterials in companion animals by 30% by 2020, with 2013 as reference year. 4. Phasing out use of narasin and other coccidiostat feed additives with antibacterial properties in the broiler production without a. compromising animal health or animal welfare b. increasing the therapeutic use of antibacterials USAGE IN ANIMALS NORM / NORM-VET 2020 26 Food-producing terrestrial animals In order to achieve Target 1 of the national strategy Animalia, whose role is to provide Norwegian farmers with knowledge and expertise, initiated and coordinated the development and implementation of a joint action plan against antibiotic resistance (1). The suggested key measures to reduce the usage of antibacterials in the livestock industry are prevention of diseases and biosecurity as well as optimising the use of antibiotics. This action plan covers cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and poultry. The indicators used to express the usage are: kg (active substance) and mg (active substance)/PCU (population correction unit) (see Appendix 1). The results of this analysis show that the reduction in the usage of antibacterial VMPs for cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and poultry from 2013-2020 was 23% and 20% when measured in kg and in mg/PCU, respectively (Figure 13). The sales patterns (data from wholesalers) have been stable across the period 2013-2020, both in terms of proportion by antibacterial substances and by pharmaceutical forms. The figures are therefore assumed not to be biased by changes towards products/antibacterial classes with higher or lower dosing per treatment. The sales of injectable antibacterial VMPs are included in sales for food-producing terrestrial animals (horses excluded in Figure 13), but as the proportion of prescribing of such products for horses and companion animals (VetReg data) was relatively stable (and very low) across 2015-2020, the impact on the trends is thought to be minor. Antibacterial human medicinal products (HMPs) are allowed to be used for animals according to the so-called cascade (Directive 2001/82/EC, Article 10) - i.e. if there is no VMP authorised for the condition an HMP is allowed to be used. For food- producing species it requires that a maximum residue level (MRL) has been established for the antibacterial substance in question or that it is shown that MRL is not nessecary. Usage of HMPs, estimated by use of VetReg data, shows that for cattle, pig, sheep and goats (see Appendix 1 for estimation methodology; Table 5 on treatment of broilers) the usage of HMPs was very low for the years 2015-2020 (68 kg, 38 kg, 32 kg, 40 kg, 50 kg and 34 kg, respectively) and was mostly accounted for by benzylpenicillin for injection and primarily used in sheep. FIGURE 13.

Figure 14 shows that sales of antibacterial VMPs for farmed fish have been below the maxium level set for the years 2015-2020. FIGURE 14.

Note the differences in the scales of the Y-axes . Companion animals (dogs and cats) Sales of antibacterial VMPs for companion animals include tablets, oral solution, injectable and oral paste approved for dogs and cats only (see Appendix I for exception for tablets). From 2013-2020 a reduction in the sales of such antibacterial VMPs for companion animals of 34% is observed (Figure 15). The use of antibacterial HMPs for dogs and cats, reported to VetReg, declined gradually from 269 kg to 212 kg (21%) from 2015-2020 (see Appendix I for estimation methodology). This indicates that prescribing antibacterial VMPs for companion animals has not been substituted by prescribing antibacterial HMPs FIGURE 15.

One of the targets stated in the National Strategy against Antibiotic Resistance is phasing out use of narasin as coccidiostat feed additive in the Norwegian broiler industry, without increasing the usage of anti-bacterials for therapeutic use. Due to the quality of the VetReg data for poultry in general - i.e. it was not possible to report to VetReg the VMPs typically used for broilers; data on number of treatments with antibiotics was obtained from Animalia (Thorbj\u00f8rn Refsnes, personal communi-cation). Table 5 shows that the annual number of broiler flocks treated with antibiotics has been very low during the years 2013-2020. TABLE 5.

In 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, a few of the broiler flocks were given narasin in 5-7 days, with the same daily dose as when used as coccidiostat feed additive and a withdrawal period of two days was applied (Bruce David, Nortura, personal communication).

NORM / NORM-VET 2020 USAGE Hege Marion Neteland, Per Espen Akselsen and Sigurd H\u00f8ye Overall antibiotic sales In 2020, the total sales of antibacterials for systemic use in humans (J01, excl. methenamine) decreased by 13% compared to 2019; from 13.2 to 11.5 DDD/1,000 inhabitants/day (Table 6). The use has decreased every year since 2012 except for a small increase from 2018-2019. The overall consumption (J01, excl. methenamine) has decreased by 32% since 2012, when a Mycoplasma pneumoniae epidemic caused a very high prescription rate of macrolides and tetracyclines. There has been a significant reduction in the use of systemic antibiotics during the Covid-19 pandemic, mainly due to reduced use of antibiotics indicated for respiratory tract infections (RTI- AB), see Figure 16. Although a lot has been achieved there are probably still areas of improvement, e.g. in individualisation of doses or duration of course length and choice of antibiotics, so one should expect that it is possible to achieve a further lowering of the consumption rate and a better narrow- spectrum profile. Antibiotics are prescription-only drugs in Norway. Overall antibiotic consumption includes all sales of antibiotics to humans in Norway i.e. in primary care, in hospitals and in long-term care institutions. Around 84% of the human use of antibacterials is used by patients outside healthcare institutions. In 2020, hospitals accounted for 8% of total DDDs of antibiotics and long-term care institutions around 6-7%. In the latest years, decreased sales are observed for all main antibiotic subgroups (Figure 17). Over years the proportion of narrow-spectrum penicillins (J01CE) of total sales (J01, excl. methenamine) has been quite stable around 27%, but it was lower in 2020 (24%). In Norway, narrow-spectrum penicillins are first-line treatment when antibiotics are warranted for respiratory tract infections. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the closing down of society combined with increased infection control has led to lower incidence of infections, and especially respiratory tract infections have been sparsely reported. The reduced use of narrow- spectrum penicillins was observed for all age groups, but was most pronounced among small children. During 2020 there have been several shortage situations for antibiotics, but generics have been available for the market and none of the shortage situations in 2020 were serious enough to impact the antibiotic consumption pattern.

After years of increased use, the urinary prophylactic agent methenamine reached a stable level in 2016. In spring 2019 we experienced a major shortage, and in 2020 the use was still lower than in 2016 (Figure 17, Table 6). Methenamine has the largest amounts of DDDs of all antibiotics used in Norway and accounted for 25% of total antibacterial use in 2020. Of the tetracyclines (J01A), doxycycline is most frequently used, followed by lymecycline, a drug mainly indicated for acne (Table 7). In 2020, the penicillins (ATC group J01C) accounted for 39% of the total antibacterial use in Norway (Figure 18). Over the years there has been a shift towards use of more broad-spectered penicillins. In 2020, beta-lactamase sensitive penicillins accounted for almost half of the penicillin group (46% share) measured in DDDs. This is lower than in earlier years, but is probably caused by the effects of Covid-19 as the picture has been stable over many years. Penicillins with extended spectrum (J01CA) represent 37% of the J01C group compared to 23% in 1999. This is mainly due to increasing use of amoxicillin and pivmecillinam. An increased use of penicillins with beta- lactamase inhibitors has been observed in the latest years (Table 6). In May 2017, oral co-amoxiclav was approved in Norway, and since then a significant increase is observed. Pivmecillinam is the main antibiotic used for urinary tract infections, at the expense of trimethoprim, and possibly due to increasing resistance in E. coli. The subgroup of sulfonamides and trimethoprim as a whole has decreased over the years, but the combination - co- trimoxazole - is increasing (Figures 17-18, Table 7). Since 2012 the use of macrolides has dropped markedly, (Tables 6-7, Figures 17-18). Use of the group J01F macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins has followed a wavy pattern over the years. The shifts in use could be explained to some degree by the recurrent epidemics of M. pneumoniae in Norway, occurring with four- to six-year intervals. Furthermore, until 2014, azithromycin and doxycycline were both recommended for genital chlamydia infection in the primary care treatment guidelines, and since then doxycyline has been the only first-line treatment. The use of macrolides is now at the same level as in the 1970s. In the latest years, sales of ATC group J01D (cephalo- sporins, monobactams and carbapenems) have decreased, mainly due to decreased use of 1st and 2nd gen. cephalo- sporins (Tables 6-7, Figure 18). In 2020 there was a slight reduction in the sales of cefotaxime, which may have at least two causes. Reduction in the use of cefotaxime and other 3rd generation cephalosporins was specifically targeted in the National Action Plan. Another factor is that since 2019, the European breakpoint committee EUCAST has recommended 1g x 3 as the standard dose for cefotaxime, whereas the most common dose in Norway has been 2g x 3. The new dosage has gradually been incorporated in guidelines and other recommendations in Norway. The quinolones represent only a small fraction (2%) of total antibacterial sales (Tables 6-7, Figure 18) and the use has steadily decreased since 2012. Focus has been put on the resistance driving effect of the quinolones, and in combination with \"dear doctor\" letters on severe adverse effects of fluoroquinolones, this has driven the decrease. Ciprofloxacin is the main substance accounting for 95% of the quinolone group in 2020. FIGURE 18.

USAGE IN HUMANS NORM / NORM-VET 2020 34 Antibiotic usage in primary care Around 84% of the total human sales of antibacterials are sold as prescriptions from pharmacies - that is prescribed to persons in primary care, mainly those living at home. The basis for these data is captured from the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD) of all prescriptions of antibacterials dispensed to persons living in Norway, and this will also include antibiotics prescribed from hospitals to discharged patients and outpatients (see Appendix 2). The decrease in total use of antibacterials in 2020 was mainly due to decreased use in primary care. A decrease of 13% was seen from 2019-2020 as measured in DDD/1,000 inhabitants. For primary care, the most important antibiotic group in 2020 was the penicillins (J01C; 37% of DDDs and J01, excl. methen- amine). Tetracyclines was the (J01A; 19% of DDDs and 10% of lincosamides (J01F; 5% of DDDs and 9% of prescriptions). The three antibiotic substances most often prescribed for outpatients in 2020 were phenoxy- methylpenicillin, pivmecillinam and doxycycline. These three antibiotics represented 49% of all prescriptions and 52% of all DDDs of the antibacterial group J01, excluding methenamine. Of the whole ATC group J01 antibacterials for systemic use in primary care, the urinary antiseptic methenamine represented 28% of DDDs and 10% of prescriptions. The steady decrease in primary care over the latest years may be due to an increased attention towards antimicrobial resistance, both among the general public and healthcare professionnals. A large proportion of general practitioners have completed quality improvement courses after the introduction of the Government's Action plan against AMR in 2016. The decrease last year is probably due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Firstly, infection control measures may have decreased the incidence of other RTIs. Secondly, the threshold for seeing a general practitioner for symptoms of infections has been raised, as GPs' offices have been closed for these patients. Geographical variation The usage of antibacterials varies among the Norwegian counties. The county using the least is using around 85% in DDDs and 81% in prescriptions of the county using the most (Figures 19-20). Over the years, and measured in DDDs, the same counties seem to be high-use counties and low-use counties, respectively. However, the difference among counties was less in 2020 than in earlier years. Antibiotic use has decreased in all counties the latest years, but with certain differences between them. Oslo is the county with the largest decrease in use of antibiotics (J01, excl. methenamine) with 37% reduction since 2012 (green dots in Figure 21). Females use more antibiotics than males; 20% of females purchased at least one antibiotic prescription (methenamine is excluded) in 2020 compared to 13% of males. The prevalence of antibiotic use has decreased over the years, more so in young children than in the elderly. The gender pattern is similar in all regions in the country. Young children, young women and the elderly are high users of antibiotics (Figure 22). Among those who use anti- bacterials, the elderly population uses more; for those above 75 years; 2.2 prescriptions/user (same for males and females) are dispensed every year compared to around 1.5 prescriptions/user for younger persons (men and women together, Figure 23). The number of DDDs/user has increased by 1-2% from 2019-2020 in all age groups except in children 0-14 years, for which the DDD/user increased by approximately one DDD unit. This indicates that those being treated were treated either by higher doses or for longer periods of time. The mean number of DDDs/ prescription is 11.5 DDDs, which indicates a mean treatment length of 11-12 days. Antibiotics prescribed by dentists Physicians are the main prescribers to humans, but in 2020 dentists prescribed around 5.5% (measured in DDDs) of antibiotics (J01) to humans in ambulatory care. Moreover, they prescribe 20% of all DDDs of metronidazole oral forms. In 2020, dentists most often prescribed phenoxymethylpenicillin (78% of all antibiotic DDDs prescribed by dentists) amoxicillin (8%), clindamycin (5%) and oral metronidazole (4%) (Figure 24).

Although UTIs are far more common in women than in men, it is estimated that approximately 20 % of UTIs occur in men [1, 2]. By definition, urinary tract infections in male patients are considered complicated infections, and treatment guidelines for these infections vary across Europe. In Norway, current treatment guidelines recommend treating non-febrile UTIs in male patients empirically with nitrofurantoin, pivmecillinam or trimethoprim for 5-7 days, whereas at-risk patients or men with suspected pyelonephritis or prostatitis should be treated empirically with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) or ciprofloxacin for 7-14 days [3]. We conducted an observational study with the aim to explore the rates of antibiotic switch as a proxy for treatment failure after treatment with UTI antibiotics in Norway between 2008-2018 [4]. Antibiotic switch was defined as a dispensed prescription of a different UTI antibiotic within 14 days after initial treatment. During the 11-year period, 476,423 men experienced 726,096 episodes of acute UTI. 13 % of the initialt prescriptions resulted in a new prescription within 14 days, where 7% (49,531/726,096) were another UTI antibiotic than the initial prescription. FIGURE 25. Proportion (%) of prescriptions of UTI antibiotic resulting in antibiotic switch by days after initial prescription. Pivmecillinam, trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin had the highest rates of antibiotic switch with 12.5%, 10.8% and 10.6%, respectively. Cefalexin, fluoroquinolones and co-trimoxazole had rates of antibiotic switch with 1.5%, 2.3% and 5.5%, respectively (Figure 25). Longer treatments (>10 DDD) decreased switch rates for trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin, but increased switch rates for fluoroquinolones and pivmecillinam. There is a lack of randomised controlled trials on treatment of male UTI, and a recent systematic review concluded that the available evidence is insufficient to make clear recommendations in relation to type and duration of antimicrobial treatment for male UTIs [5]. Our data suggest that the antibiotic treatment failure rate in men is relatively low, and comparable to the failure rate in women [6-8]. Hence, aiming to reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, current guideline recommendations seem safe. References: 1. Haugom LEA, Ruths S, Emberland KE, Eliassen KER, G, Wensaas K-A.

This was a decrease of 11% in DDD/1,000 inhibitants/day compared to 2019 (Figure 26). The decrease is exceptional and is related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The hospitals restructured their departments and postponed elective surgery as preparation for the expected high numbers of inpatients with severe Covid-19 disease. This resulted in fewer admissions and fewer bed days as most hospitals turned out to actually have surplus capacity. The last three years the total sales of antibiotics to hospitals have been stable when measured in DDD/1,000 inhabitants/ day, but a change in pattern of use has occurred with increased use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics. The narrow- spectrum penicillins are highly utilised, and for this group the theoretical DDD-value is lower than the therapeutic doses most commonly prescribed in Norway. Furthermore, combination regimens with a narrow-spectrum penicillin plus an aminoglycoside accounts for more DDDs than if monotherapy with a cephalosporin or carbapenem is used. This implies that the total count of DDDs will show artificially high values for volume. The therapy pattern of antibacterials in hospitals does not change much from one year to another, however a decrease in use of selected broad-spectrum antibiotics has been observed since 2012. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (defined as J01_CR/DC/DD/DI/DF/DH/MA) accounted for 20% of total hospital DDDs in 2020 compared to 26% in 2012. The share of beta-lactamase sensitive penicillins in 2020 was 17% of the total (Figure 26). Penicillins (J01C) represent 47% of the use the cephalo- sporins (20% of all DDDs), the dominant subgroup being 3rd generation cephalosporins (J01DD). In 2020, six substances accounted for 52% of all DDDs used in hospitals. cefo- taxime, gentamicin and Figure 27 shows annual trends in national antibiotic use in hospitals by hospital activity data instead of population statistics. The two measurements (bed days and admissions) together show the interplay between shorter hospital stays and intensity of antibiotic treatment. The length of stay (LOS) in Norwegian hospitals in the latest years has been relatively stable according to national statistics, but the number of admissions and bed days are both going down. Data for antibiotic use in hospital care are usually presented as DDD/number of bed days or DDD/number of admissions to correct for activity, because that makes comparisons between hospitals possible. Reduced number of bed days in Norway over the latest years probably does not reflect reduced hospital activity in the country as a whole, but a shift from in-patient treatment to day-care and outpatient treatment. Figur 28 visualises the impact of the reduction in bed days on antibiotic consumption statistics. Seven selected groups that mainly are used in hospitals are shown in Figure 29. The use of piperacillin/tazobactam has been increasing for many years, but was markedly reduced in 2017 and 2018 due to a nationwide shortage. In 2019, there was no shortage, and in 2020 an increase was observed. There was increased use of aminoglycosides, beta-lactamase resistant penicillins, sulfonamides and trimethoprim, but decreased use of 3rd and higher generation cephalosporins (not shown). This is probably due to implementation of antibiotic stewardship programmes in Norwegian hospitals from 2016. The use of aminoglycosides increased by 48% from 2016-2020, whereas the use of quinolones has decreased by 28%. The use of carbapenems peaked in 2014 after many years of increasing use, and seems to have reached a stable level. Only parenteral formulations of 2nd, 3rd and higher generation cephalosporins as well as carbapenems are licensed in Norway. Figure 30 shows that the distribution between \"preferred antibiotics\" (which largely reflects standard treatment regimens in national guidelines) and \"resistance driving antibiotics\" for the different Norwegian hospitals. The proportion of preferred antibiotics varies from 54% to 81%. There are large variations in volume of antibiotics used, measured in DDD/100 bed days, and in therapy profile between hospitals. Figure 31 shows the use of five selected groups of broad-spectrum antibiotics targeted in the National Action Plan in all Norwegian hospitals/health trusts. The variations cannot be accounted for by differences in activity or patient populations alone. USAGE IN HUMANS NORM / NORM-VET 2020 40 FIGURE 26.

The Strategy was followed by a National Action Plan, issued January 2016, with suggested ways to reach the targets within 2020. The overall goal for total human consumption was reduction of DDDs by 30%. In addition, two sector specific goals in ambulatory care were introduced; reduction of average number of prescriptions (target; 250 prescriptions per 1,000 inhabitants per year) and the reduction of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections by 20% (in DDD/1,000 inhabitants/day). Figure 32 shows total human use (J01) and use of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections in Norway since 2012 according to national targets. DDD/1,000 inhabitants/day for J01 has been reduced by 25% since 2012. When excluding methen- amine, the reduction in use has been 32% (Table 6). There are county differences with some counties using more Guidelines recommened antibiotics (i.e. narrow-spectrum antibiotics), indicating a higher adherence rate to the national Guidelines (Figure 33). There were smaller county differences in propoportional use of Guidelines recommened antibiotics in 2020 compared to 2012. This may indicate that AMR awareness as well as adherence to guidelines has increased in all counties in the period. Precriptions (Rx) per 1,000 inhabitants per year (J01, excl. methenamine) is reduced by 37% since 2012 from 444 to 282 Rx/1,000 inhabitants/year in 2020. Between 2012 and 2019, there has been a reduced prevalence of use in all age groups with the largest reduction (around 33%) in small children (0-9 years) and the lowest reduction for elderly above 70 years (15%). Moreover, the use in men is reduced more than in women. There was a dramatic reduction during the pandemic in 2020, which is mainly due to lower prescribing of antibiotics for respiratory tract infections, Figure 34. The largest reduction in prescriptions per 1,000 during the pandemic was observed in children 0-9 years olds; 33% less prescriptions pr 1,000 and 41% less prescriptions with antibiotics mainly used for respiratory tract infections in 2020 compared to 2019. For hospitals, the main target is 30% reduction in combined use of five selected groups of antibiotics. To reach this goal, the National Action Plan also made antibiotic stewardship programmes mandatory in Norwegian hospitals. Figure 35 shows the annual variation of total hospital use of these groups in the years 2006-2020 according to the national target. Figure 36 shows how the use of these five groups has changed in the different Norwegian hospitals/health trusts in relation to the national target. A reduction by 30% is marked by a black dotted line in the figure. For all hospitals in Norway together there was 14.8 % reduction in use of the five selected groups of broad-spectrum antibiotics from 2012-2020 when adjusting for activity (bed days). The number of bed days is going down every year and there is a large increase in outpatient consultations, therefore it is probably necessary to use more than one indicator of clinical activity in hospitals when assessing drug use data. Unadjusted sales data measured in DDDs show a reduction of 31% for the same period (see also Figure 28). Norway has two national advisory units for antibiotic use, one for primary care (established in 2006); the Antibiotics Center for Primary Health Care (ASP) and one for hospitals/specialist services (established in 2011); the National Centre for Antibiotic Use in Hospitals (KAS). These advisory units have been strengthened and appointed key roles in the National Action Plan. The Directorate of Health has issued National Antibiotic Treatment Guidelines for ambulatory care, nursing homes, dentists and hospitals in collaboration with the advisory units. FIGURE 32.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS In total, 86.5% of the isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents included in the susceptibility testing. Klebsiella pneumoniae has an inherently low susceptibility to ampicillin and this antibiotic was excluded from further assessment. The following proportions of isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobial classes (ampicillin excluded): 4.1% were resistant to one, 4.1% to two and 5.4% to three or more antimicrobial classes, respectively. One of the isolates was resistant to seven antimicrobial classes and two isolates were resistant to five antimicrobial classes. Two of these multi-drug resistant isolates, both from infections in dogs, displayed resistance to the ESCs cefotaxime and ceftazidime. This was due to presence of the blaCTX-M-15 gene. All isolates resistant to more than two antimicrobial classes were resistant to quinolones. None of the isolates displayed resistance to the carbapenem meropenem. Clinical breakpoints are shown in dotted blue lines in Table 8. However, these clinical breakpoints are defined in order to indicate if treatment of a specific pathogen is likely to succeed or not, and factors like dosage and formulations will affect the result. This is the first time K. pneumoniae is included in NORM- VET, and comparisons to previous years are therefore not possible. K. pneumoniae is probably not a particularly prominent pathogen among domesticated animals in Norway, as reflected by the long sampling period and low number of isolates. K. pneumoniae is an important human pathogen and is included in the NORM surveillance programme. It is also listed on the WHO Global Priority Pathogen List, in the critical priority category.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS This is the first time A. pleuropneumoniae is included in NORM-VET. The range for several of the substances were too narrow to define ECOFFs based on the available distributions. Therefore, the true occurrence of resistance could not be determined. Among the antimicrobial agents where resistance could be determined, the most commonly detected resistances were to the amphenicol florfenicol and the quinolones danofloxacin and enrofloxacin. The national recommendations for antimicrobial treatment of A. pleuropneumoniae infections in pigs list benzyl- penicillinprocain as the first-choice drug. Only one of the included isolates was classified as resistant to benzyl- penicillin, indicating a low occurrence of resistance to this first-choice antibiotic. NORM / NORM-VET 2020 ANIMAL CLINICAL ISOLATES 49 Antimicrobial resistance genes in Norwegian Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae isolates In the Norwegian pig population except for specific pathogen free (SPF) herds, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae occurs endemically and can on its own cause severe acute respiratory disease outbreaks (1). Therapeutic recommendations on porcine pleuropneumoniae are supported by updated phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility data, as provided by the NORM/NORM- VET report. For A. pleuropneumoniae , genotypic testing of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has shown to correlate nearly 100% with phenotypes for most relevant antimicrobial agents (2), hence genotyping will likely be of value to future surveillance of AMR in this important porcine pathogen. A. pleuropneumoniae serovar 8 (APP8) is the dominating clinical serovar in Norway (3,1). The genotypic AMR of Norwegian isolates was assessed in a study comparing occurrence of AMR genes in APP8 from Norway, Demark and the UK (4). Methods The collection of 123 Norwegian APP8 isolates originated from diagnostic sampling at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute (NVI) from 2004-2019 and a field study of respiratory disease in 2017-2018. Isolates from the same collection were tested for phenotypic AMR by NORM-VET for the 2020 report, however, due to different selection criteria it was impossible to compare the results. The isolates were whole genome sequenced using Illumina technology. The presence of AMR genes was investigated using ABRicate (https://github.com/tseemann/abricate) to search the assembled genomes for genes associated with AMR in the ResFinder database (5). The phylogenetic relationship between the isolates was assessed by maximum likelihood approach on pairwise Single Nucleotide Polymorphism distances. Results AMR genes were only identified in four out of 123 isolates (Table 10). The following AMR genes were identified: aph(3'')-Ib and aph(6)-Id aph(6)-Id , tet(Y) and sul2 was found in three isolates. The isolates were disseminated in the phylogeny, which points to independent acquisition of these genes. TABLE 10. Antimicrobial resistance genes identified in 123 isolates of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (4) and sul2 = sulfonamide resistance gene. The number of isolates harboring the gene is given in parentheses. Discussion There was a low occurrence of AMR genes in APP8 isolates from the Norwegian pig population, differing significantly in comparison to other national APP8 populations (4). There was no evidence of emerging resistant genetic lines, for instance due to selective pressure from antimicrobial drug usage, likely explained by a prudent use of antimicrobial drugs in Norway. Independent acquisition of AMR genes could have happened through random mutations or horizontal transmission from other species in the environment . AMR genes can accumulate in special mobilisable genetic elements that facilitate horizontal transmission of these genes together, previously demonstrated in APP8 (6, 7). Whether the genes identified in this study are part of a common mobilisable element requires further investigation. Geographic location and restrictions on live pig movements have been important for the molecular evolution of the APP8 populations (4). Regulation on livestock trade will likely be important to sustain a bacterial population widely susceptible to antimicrobial drugs, for instance by stopping an introduction of multi-resistant A. pleuropneumoniae strains from other pig populations. Note that there may be a divergence between the phenotypic susceptibility results of the minimum inhibitory concentration testing and the identified AMR genes. The limitations of identifying AMR genes in ResFinder are tied to a lack in knowledge of genetic variants associated with the respective phenotypes. References: 1.

INDICATOR BACTERIA FROM ANIMALS, FOOD AND FEED NORM / NORM-VET 2020 50 INDICATOR BACTERIA FROM ANIMALS Madelaine Norstr\u00f6m, Jannice Schau Sletteme\u00e5s and Anne Margrete Urdahl The prevalence of acquired antimicrobial resistance among certain bacteria of the normal enteric microbiota can be used as an indicator of the selective pressure from use of antimicrobial agents in various populations. These bacteria may form a reservoir of transferrable resistance genes from which antimicrobial resistance can be spread to other bacteria, including those responsible for infections in animals or humans. Thus, monitoring of resistance among indicator bacteria of the normal enteric microbiota from healthy animals, as well as from feed and food, is important to get an overview of the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, detect trends and evaluate effects of interventions. Bacterial resistance to critically important antimicrobials, such as extended-spectrum cephalosporins and carba- penems, has received special attention over the last years. These are defined by the WHO as critically important for antimicrobial treatment of human infections. Monitoring the resistance to these substances in the bacterial population is therefore of special interest. A reservoir of such resistant bacteria in food production animals and the food chain is of concern as they may have an impact on resistance development in human bacterial populations. NORM-VET is following the requirements set in Commission implementing decision of 12. Nov 2013 on the monitoring and reporting of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and commensal bacteria (2013/652/EU). In addition, NORM-VET includes antimicrobial testing of bacteria from sources other than those covered by this legal act and use of selective methods targeting specific antimicrobial resistant bacteria. The use of selective methods is especially relevant for low prevalence sources, as it enables early detection of important resistance mechanisms; thereby enabling these to be monitored and characterised. In NORM-VET, E. coli and Enterococcus spp. are used as indicator bacteria. Selective methods are used for detection of E. coli resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC), carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE). In 2020, animal samples included caecal samples from broiler and turkey flocks. These samples were analysed for E. coli and Enterococcus spp., including ESC resistant E. coli, CRE and VRE. The substances in the antimicrobial test panels are included due to their importance in human medicin, and are not necessarily relevant for use in veterinary medicine. Some of the cut-off values defining resistance applied in NORM-VET have been changed over the years. To facilitate comparisons in this report, data on prevalence of resistance presented in earlier reports have been recalculated using the cut-off values applied in 2020. Only data retrieved following the requirements set in decision 2013/652/EU are shown. For previous data, please see the respective annual reports. Sampling, laboratory methods and data processing are described in Appendix 3.

Altogether, 16.2% of the isolates were resistant to one antimicrobial class (predominantely quinolones), 3.2% to two and 0.8% to three antimicrobial classes (Figure 37). In total, 20.2% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial, indicating a high occurrence of resistance in broilers according to the EFSA classification described in Appendix 6. Resistance to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid were the most frequently identified resistance determinants, followed by resistance to tetracycline, trimethoprim and ampicillin. As shown in Figure 37, the number of isolates being fully susceptible has been relatively stable around 80% over the years 2014-2020. The antimicrobial classes for which the isolates show resistance have changed over these years (Figure 38). There has been an increase in resistance to quinolones (i.e. ciprofloxacin and/or nalidixic acid) from 2014-2020 (p=0.002). was identified in isolates, while 12.6% 8.7-17.3] of the isolates in 2020 were quinolone resistant. In the years inbetween, i.e. in 2016 quinolone resistant, respectively. For sulfonamides and penicillins with extended spectrum (i.e. for sulfamethoxa-zole and ampicillin, respectively), however, a decrease in resistance over these years is indicated in Figure 38. Observed resistance to sulfamethoxazole has decreased These changes are, however, not statistically significant. None of the E. coli isolates from broilers displayed resistance to the extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) [95% CI: 0.0-1.5]. This is in concordance with the results from 2016 and 2018. In addition, a selective method was used to investigate the occurrence of ESC resistant E. coli in the same broiler caecal sample material (see next page). In an international perspective, the occurrence of resistance among E. coli from Norwegian broilers is low, though the occurrence varies markedly between countries reporting to EFSA with the Nordic countries having the lowest resistance levels (EFSA and ECDC Summary report 2018/2019). This favorable situation is probably due to the very limited use of antibiotics in Norwegian broiler production. TURKEY The 2020 data showed that 74.4% of the E. coli isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents included. Altogether, 9.9% of the isolates were resistant to one antimicrobial class (predominantly ampicillin), 8.3% to two and 7.4% to three or more antimicrobial classes (Figure 39). In total, 25.6% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, indicating a high occurrence of resistance in turkey according to the EFSA classification described in Appendix 6. Resistance to ampicillin was the most frequently identified resistance determinant, followed by resistance to tetracycline, trimethoprim and sulfa- methoxazole. As shown in Figure 39, the number of isolates being fully susceptible has been relatively stable around 71-74% over the years 2016-2020. The antimicrobial classes for which the isolates show resistance have, however, changed over these years (Figure 40). The figure indicates that there has been an increase in resistance to penicillins with extended spectrum (i.e. ampicillin) from CI: 12.4-27.1] in 2020. The observed change is, however, not statistically significant and further monitoring is needed to assess whether this is a truly increasing trend. Resistance to quinolones (i.e. cipro- floxacin and/or nalidixic acid) was detected in 2.5% [95% CI: 0.5-7.1] of the isolates. These results are in concordance with results from previous years. Two of the isolates displayed resistance to ESC (i.e. cefotaxime and ceftazidime) [95% CI: 0.2-5.8]. Both had to an AmpC beta-lactamase phenotype, and genotyping showed that the resistance was due to mutations in the promoter and attenuator regions of the chromosomally located ampC gene resulting in ampC overexpression. These two were also detected by the use of a selective method to investigate the occurrence of ESC resistant E. coli in the same turkey caecal sample material (see next page). In an international perspective, the occurrence of resistance among E. coli from Norwegian turkey is low, though the occurrence varies markedly between countries reporting to EFSA with the Nordic countries having the lowest resistance levels (EFSA and ECDC Summary report 2018/2019). NORM / NORM-VET 2020 INDICATOR BACTERIA FROM ANIMALS, FOOD AND FEED 55 Extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant Escherichia coli from cattle, goats and pigs A total of 242 broiler and 121 turkey flocks were investigated for the presence of E. coli resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC). The results are presented in the text and and in Figures 41-42. RESULTS AND COMMENTS BROILER ESC resistant E. coli were found in one (0.4% [95% CI: 0.0- 2.3]) of the 242 broiler caecal samples. As described above, no cephalosporin resistant isolates were found by using the standard non-selective procedure, indicating that the within-flock prevalence is low. Quantification of E. coli resistant to ESC and total E. coli in the positive sample, showed that the level of resistant bacteria was below the detection point of 100 CFU/g and the total E. coli number was between 105-106 CFU/g (performed as previously described in textbox, page 52, in NORM/NORM-VET 2016). The identified isolate carried the blaCMY-2 gene and was resistant to quinolones in addition to the ESCs cefotaxime and ceftazidime. The isolate did not show reduced susceptibility to meropenem, the preferred carbapenem used for detection of carbapenem resistance. As shown in Figure 41, these results are in concordance with the results from 2018, and confirms that the measures implemented by the industry to reduce the occurrence of ESC resistant E. coli in broilers have been successful. Also, in a European perspective, this prevalence of ESC resistant E. coli in broilers is low, though the occurrence varies markedly between countries reporting to EFSA (EFSA and ECDC Summary report 2018/2019). The South- Eastern, South-Central and South-Western countries tended to report a higher prevalence than the Nordic countries and, to a lesser extent, than countries from Western Europe. There are also variations in prevalence between the Nordic countries, with Norway having the lowest reported prevalence. TURKEY ESC resistant E. coli were found in 7.4% [95% CI: 3.5- 13.7] of the 121 turkey caecal samples. As described above, two ESC resistant isolates were found by using the non- selective procedure, indicating that the within-flock prevalence is low. These were from the same samples as detected by this selective method. All nine isolates were only resistant to beta-lactams, i.e. ampicillin and the ESCs cefotaxime and ceftazidime. None of the isolates showed reduced susceptibility to meropenem, the preferred carba- penem used for detection of carbapenem resistance. All the isolates had a cephalosporin resistance profile corresponding to an AmpC beta-lactamase phenotype, and whole genome sequencing showed that the resistance was due to mutations in the promoter and attenuator regions of the chromosomally located ampC gene resulting in ampC overexpression. Compared to previous results, it appears to have been a decrease in occurrence of ESC resistant E. coli due to presence of the plasmid mediated blaCMY-2 gene from 5.1% [95% and 2020 [95% CI: 0.0-3.0] (Figure 42). This change, however, is statistically non-significant. ESC resistance due to chromosomal mutations in the promoter region of the chromosomal ampC gene, appears to be relatively stable between 5-8% (Figure 42). Further monitoring is necessary to follow this situation in the future. In an international perspective, the occurrence of ESC resistant E. coli in Norwegian turkey is low, though the occurrence varies markedly between countries reporting to EFSA (EFSA and ECDC Summary report 2018/2019).

Food-producing animals and their food products are considered a plausible source for human acquisition of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria (4). However, the zoonotic potential of ESC-resistant E. coli from broiler production and their potential role as extraintestinal pathogens is unclear. The aim of the current study was to characterise ESC-resistant E. coli isolated from Norwegian retail chicken meat in 2012-2016 with regard to population structure, presence of virulence-associated geno- and phenotypes and carriage of AMR genes to evaluate their uropathogenic potential. We included all ESC-resistant E. coli (n=141) isolated from retail chicken meat in NORM-VET from 2012-2016 and performed whole genome sequencing. All isolates harboured the blaCMY-2 gene, responsible for ESC resistance (1-3). The population structure was evaluated using multilocus sequence type (MLST) and core-genome MLST (cgMLST), and the presence of AMR- and virulence genes determined using the ARIBA programme (antimicrobial resistance identification by assembly) and the ResFinder, VirulenceFinder and vfdb databases (5-9). In addition, a selection of 18 isolates were included in in vitro experiments to determine their phenotypic characteristics relating to expression of type 1 fimbriae, adhesion and invasion, bacterial growth, serum resistance, colicin production, biofilm production and motility. The isolates were genetically diverse, with 19 different sequence types (STs) observed. There were temporal variations in the distribution of STs. In general, a limited number of virulence genes were present in the isolates. Five of the STs, namely ST131, ST117, ST38, ST10 and ST69 are commonly associated with extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) infections (10). Among the 18 isolates selected for phenotypic testing, we observed a high diversity in virulence-associated phenotypes, suggesting highly variable uropathogenic potential as well. None of the isolates belonging to traditional ExPEC-associated STs appeared to have a higher uropathogenic potential compared to other STs. The high diversity of virulence-associated traits among the isolates suggests that the uropathogenic potential of ESC-resistant E. coli from retail chicken meat is dependent on the isolate. However, the susceptibility of the host may also have a possible impact. In conclusion, the uropathogenic potential of ESC-resistant E. coli from Norwegian broiler production seems to be limited, and the risk of exposure to ESC-resistant E. coli with uropathogenic potential through handling and consumption of retail chicken meat in Norway appears to be low. This work was performed in the NoResist project (NoResist - combating antimicrobial resistance in the Norwegian food production chain), financed by the Research Council of Norway (project number 250212) and the Norwegian Veterinary Institute.

INDICATOR BACTERIA FROM ANIMALS, FOOD AND FEED NORM / NORM-VET 2020 58 Comparative genomics of quinolone resistant Escherichia coli from wild animals and livestock species The occurrence of quinolone resistance in Escherichia coli is low in Norwegian livestock [1-6]. This is likely due to a low usage of antimicrobials, including quinolones, but also a consequence of good animal health. Despite low usage of quinolones, quinolone resistant E. coli (QREC) can been detected in a high proportion of samples from broilers and pigs [7]. As the selective pressure is expected to be low, the finding was somewhat surprising. Therefore, investigations to explore the level of QREC among several animal species, identify their quinolone resistance determinants, and to identify their origins were conducted. QREC isolates (n=285) from broilers, pigs, red foxes, and wild birds were subjected to whole genome sequencing [8]. Wild animal species were included to be able to identify possible wild reservoirs of QREC. A phylogenetic approach was used to investigate the evolutionary relationships between the isolates. The overall occurrence of QREC among the four animal species was low, but a significantly higher occurrence was detected in broilers [8]. The results revealed that mutations in the chromosomal DNA gyrase gene gyrA was the major resistance determinant among all included isolates, and a low level of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance was identified. The initial phylogenetic analysis revealed a high diversity of QREC among the included animal species. Major sequence types overlapped for both production- and wild animal species, but the overall evolutionary distance was too great to determine a clonal transmission. A denser aggregation was observed for isolates from broilers compared to the rest of the animal species. The phylogenetic analysis also revealed potential dissemination within the broiler and pig production chains separately, and possible persistence in the broiler production chain [8]. This initiated further investigations to identify the origin of QREC in broilers. Comparing QREC to wildtype E. coli from broilers showed that commensal E. coli rarely develop resistance in the broiler production environment [9]. However, the same sequence types as previously described in other Nordic countries were detected [10], supporting the hypothesis that import of parent animals may be a source of QREC. This highlights the importance of biosecurity measures at the top of the broiler production pyramid, to prevent dissemination of QREC. The studies summarised here are more thoroughly discussed in the cited papers and PhD Thesis [11]. References: 1. NORM/NORM-VET 2014.

Narasin was not included in these calculations, and is commented separately below. E. faecalis : Altogether, 58.6% of the isolates were resistant to one antimicrobial class (mainly tetracycline) and 10.3% to two (mainly tetracycline and erythromycin). E. faecium: Altogether, 16.5% of the isolates were resistant to one antimicrobial class (mainly erythromycin) and 0.8% to two antimicrobial classes. Reduced susceptibility to linezolid was observed in two of the isolates. However, no acquired resistance genes nor point mutations were detected. In total, 69.0% of the E. faecalis isolates and 17.3% of the E. faecium isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent, indicating a very high and moderate occurrence of resistance, respectively, according to the EFSA classification described in Appendix 6. Compared to the data from 2018, there has been an increase in occurrence of tetracycline resistance among E. the occurrence in 2014 more similar to 2020 with 52.3% [95% CI: 39.5-64.9], and further monitoring is needed to follow this in the years to come. The prevalence of tetracycline resistance among E. faecalis is surprising, as there is insignificant use of oxytetracycline for clinical purposes in Norwegian broiler production. Resistance to narasin was identified in 1.1% of the E. faecalis and 15.6% of the E. faecium isolates. The results indicate a decreasing trend in occurrence of narasin resistance in both E. faecalis and E. faecium from broilers. In 2018, narasin resistance was detected in 3.6% of the E. faecalis and in 24.7% of the E. faecium . The observed change in E. faecium is statistically significant (p<0.02). This decrease in occurrence is expected as the use of narasin as coccidiostat to broilers was phased out in Norway in 2015-2016, and since then Norwegian broilers have been raised without the use of coccidiostats. Though some flocks have been treated with narasin in cases of outbreak (see chapter on usage in animals). This has been possible due to implementation of coccidia vaccines for all broilers. None of the E. faecium or E. faecalis isolates displayed resistance to vancomycin. This is in concordance with results from 2014 and 2018. Avoparcin, which induces cross-resistance to vancomycin, was routinely used as a growth promoter in Norwegian broiler and turkey production from 1986 until it was banned in 1995. The use selected for a reservoir of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) in Norwegian broiler production that persisted for many years after the ban was implemented. TURKEY The 2020 data showed that 54.2% of the E. faecalis and 61.7% of the E. faecium isolates from turkey caecal samples were susceptible to all antimicrobial classes included in the test panel. Narasin was not included in these calculations, and is commented separately below. E. faecalis : Altogether, 33.3% of the isolates were resistant to one antimicrobial class (mainly tetracyclines or erythromycin), 12.5% classes. E. faecium: Altogether, 32.2% of the isolates were resistant to one antimicrobial class (mainly tetracyclines), 5.2% to two (mainly erythromycin and ampicillin), and 0.9% to three or more antimicrobial classes. Reduced susceptibility to linezolid was observed in one of the isolates. However, no acquired resistance genes nor point mutations were detected. In total, 45.8% of the E. faecalis isolates and 38.3% of the E. faecium isolates were resistant to at least one anti- microbial class (narasin not included), indicating a high occurrence of resistance, according to the EFSA classification described in Appendix 6. Resistance to narasin was identified in 8.3% of the E. faecalis and 78.2% of the E. faecium isolates. In contrast to the result for broilers, the occurrence of narasin resistance in E. faecalis and E. faecium from turkey has not changed. The occurrence in E. faecium has been relatively stable around 80%. Due to high toxicity in turkeys, narasin has never been used in the turkey production. Instead the coccidiostat monensin is used. There is no indication of cross-resistance between narasin and monensin, and the reason behind the occurrence of narasin resistance in E. faecium from turkey is therefore not clear. None of the E. faecium or E. faecalis isolates displayed resistance to vancomycin. This is in concordance with results from 2018. Avoparcin, which induces cross- resistance to vancomycin, was routinely used as a growth promoter in Norwegian broiler and turkey production from 1986 until it was banned in 1995. The use selected for a reservoir of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) in Norwegian broiler production that persisted for many years after the ban was implemented. Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE) from broiler and turkey A total of 247 caecal samples from broiler flocks and 121 caecal samples from turkey flocks were screened for the presence of vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE). No VRE were detected in the broiler [95% CI: 0.0-1.5] or turkey [95% CI: 0.0-3.0] samples. This is in concordance with the result from 2018. For broilers a statistically significant decrease from 2014 when 6.7% [95% CI: 3.7-10.9] of the flocks were VRE positive. INDICATOR BACTERIA FROM ANIMALS, FOOD AND FEED NORM / NORM-VET 2020 64 Characterisation of a narasin resistance mechanism in Enterococcus faecium Feed used for conventional rearing of poultry has historically been supplemented with antimicrobial substances to reduce serious diseases in the poultry population. Between 1986 and 1995 (Norway; 1997 in the EU), poultry feed was supplemented with the glycopeptide avoparcin. However, use of avoparcin selected for vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) in European livestock and VRE was detected in the community. When use of avoparcin was discontinued in Norway in 1995, and Europe in 1997, poultry feed was supplemented with polyether ionophores to control coccidiosis and reduce occurrence of necrotising enteritis. As a result, occurrence of VRE in poultry was drastically reduced, but surveillance data revealed that enterococci resistant to the polyether ionophore narasin were prevalent and a reservoir of VRE persisted in the Norwegian as well as European poultry populations. The prophylactic use of polyether ionophores was phased out of the Norwegian broiler production in 2015 as part of an intervention strategy to reduce antibiotic use, occurrence of antibiotic resistance and maintain animal health in poultry production, and since 2016 broilers have been reared on feed free of polyether ionophores. Since then, occurrence of narasin resistant enterococci has been reduced and VRE have not been detected in the Norwegian broiler population [1, 2]. Although it is not possible at this time to conclude that the inability to detect VRE in Norwegian poultry is a direct consequence of the discontinuation of narasin as a broiler feed additive, a number of facts support this notion. Firstly, all of the VRE isolated from Norwegian poultry in 2006-2014 are also narasin resistant suggesting co-selection of resistance to narasin and vancomcyin [2]. Secondly, narasin resistance has been shown to be co-localised on mobile plasmids and both resistance mechanisms have been shown to be transferred between bacteria by conjugation [3, 4]. Genetic analysis found an association between narasin resistance and a two gene operon encoding a putative membrane transporter [4]. In a recent study performed by the University of Oslo and the Norwegian Veterinary Institute, this operon was cloned under the native promoter and the ability to confer resistance to a panel of antibiotics was assessed [3]. It was for the first time definitely confirmed that the two genes confer resistance to narasin, and cross-resistance was demonstrated against the polyether ionophores salinomycin, and maduramicin. The two genes were named narasin resistance genes A and B, and the resistance mechanism is referred to as NarAB [3]. Interestingly, NarAB did not provide resistance against the polyether ionophore monensin or any of the clinically used antimicrobials tested in the study, including vancomycin. This proves that the observed selection of vancomycin resistant transconjugants during conjugation experiments was due to co-selection of physically linked narasin and vancomycin resistance on mobile plasmids. This experiment specifically and the study in general support that use of polyether ionophores as feed additives can select for vancomycin resistance and that use of in-feed narasin has contributed to persistence of VRE in poultry.

NORM / NORM-VET 2020 INDICATOR BACTERIA FROM ANIMALS, FOOD AND FEED 65INDICATOR BACTERIA FROM FOOD Gro is following the requirements set in Commission implementing decision of 12. Nov 2013 on the monitoring and reporting of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in food (2013/652/EU). In addition, NORM-VET includes antimicrobial testing of bacteria from sources other than those covered by this legal act and uses of selective methods targeting specific antimicrobial resistant bacteria. The use of selective methods is especially relevant for low prevalence sources, as it enables early detection of important resistance mechanisms; thereby enabling these to be monitored and characterised. Bacterial resistance to critically important antimicrobials, such as extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) and carbapenems, has received special attention over the last years. These are defined by the WHO as critically important for treatment of human infections. Monitoring the occurrence of bacteria resistant to these substances in different foods is therefore of special interest. A reservoir of such resistant bacteria in the food chain is of concern as they may have an impact on resistance development in human bacterial populations. In NORM-VET, Escherichia coli are used as indicator bacteria from food sources. Selective methods for detection of E. coli resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins were included in NORM-VET from 2011. From 2015 a selective method for detection of carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae was implemented as well. In 2020, food samples included broiler meat. Some of the cut-off values defining resistance applied in NORM-VET have been changed over the years. To facilitate comparisons in this report, data on prevalence of resistance presented in earlier reports have been recalculated using the cut-off values applied in 2020. Sampling, laboratory methods and data processing are described in Appendix 3. Extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistant Escherichia coli from broiler meat A total of 323 broiler meat samples were analysed for the presence of E. coli resistant to extended-spectrum cephalo-sporins (ESC). Results are presented in Figure 48 and in the text. RESULTS AND COMMENTS ESC resistant E. coli were found in three (0.9%) [95% CI: 0.2-2.7] of the 323 meat samples. The isolates were only resistant to beta-lactams, i.e. ampicillin and the ESC cefotaxime and ceftazidime. The isolates had a cephalo- sporin resistance profile corresponding an AmpC beta- lactamase phenotype, and whole genome sequencing showed that the isolates contained the blaCMY-2 gene. The isolates did not show decreased susceptibility to meropenem, the preferred carbapenem used for detection of carbapenem resistance. There was a significant reduction of E. coli resistant to ESC in broiler meat in 2018 (p<0.001) as compared to previous years (Figure 48). The result from 2020 is in concordance with results from 2018. In a European perspective, the occurrence of 0.9% E. coli resistant to ESC in broiler meat in Norway is very low, although the occurrence varied markedly between countries reporting to EFSA in 2018 (EFSA and ECDC Summary report 2018/19). A decrease in prevalence has also been observed in several other European countries. The South- Eastern, South-Central and South-Western countries tended to report a higher prevalence than the Nordic countries and, to a lesser extent, than countries from Western Europe. There are also variations in prevalence between the Nordic countries, with Norway having the lowest prevalence. FIGURE 48. Occurrence (%) of ESC resistant E. coli in broiler meat samples in 2012-2020. All isolates had genotype blaCMY-2. Carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae from broiler A total of 323 broiler samples were screened for the presence of carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). No CRE were detected. Carbapenems are not approved for use in food-producing animals in the EU and EEA countries. Nevertheless, resistance to these critically important antimicrobial agents has sporadically been reported from animals in some of the EU/EEA countries, and further monitoring is recommended to follow the situation in the years to come. 05101520253035 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020Occurrence (%) of ESC resistant E. coli in broiler meat samples INDICATOR BACTERIA FROM ANIMALS, FOOD AND FEED NORM / NORM-VET 2020 66 Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in pig in Norway in 2020 There are several variants of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), some of which are associated with animals (especially pigs), and are collectively referred to as LA-MRSA (livestock-associated MRSA). Within a few years, LA-MRSAs have become widespread in pig populations around the world, thereby representing a risk for dissemination to the human population. LA-MRSA in European pig has mainly been attributed to clonal complex (CC) 398. As the only country in the world, Norway implemented a control strategy from 2013 including measures to eradicate MRSA in pigs as described in Gr\u00f8ntvedt et al. 2016 (1). The rationale behind this strategy was to prevent the pig population from becoming a domestic reservoir of MRSA with the potential of zoonotic transmission, as MRSA is not a significant cause of disease in pig. As part of this strategy, an extensive yearly surveillance programme was implemented from 2014. The aim of the programme is to identify MRSA positive pig herds. Each year the nucleus and multiplier herds, as well as central units of sow pool herds and the 20 biggest sow herds are sampled twice, while the remaining sow herds are sampled once. Every third year finisher pig herds are sampled instead of the sow herds. Further details can be found in the annual reports (2-7). In 2020, a total of 641 herds were included, of which 81 were genetic nucleus or multiplier herds, 12 herds were central units of the sow pool herds, 18 were of the largest farrow to grower or farrow to finish herds, and the remaining 530 were herds with more than 10 sows. The surveillance programme did not detect any pig herds with MRSA. Further details can be found in the report \"The surveillance programme for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus in pig in Norway 2020\" (8). Throughout the years there have been a few additional MRSA findings from herds not included in the surveillance, as well as herds detected through contact tracing. Table 15 shows the number of herds identified by the MRSA surveillance programme and the total number of detected MRSA positive herds from 2014-2020, as well as results from MRSA typing. Various MRSA types have been detected. Not all of these have been regarded as LA-MRSA. In Norway we define LA-MRSA as an MRSA that has been previously shown or is currently showing ability to establish and spread between animals or animal herds. An example of this was seen in 2015 when an MRSA CC1 t177 was detected from several pig herds. This is further described in Elstr\u00f8m et al. 2019 (9). TABLE 15. MRSA positive pig herds 2013-2020.

Anne Margrete Urdahl and Carl Andreas Gr\u00f8ntvedt. Norwegian Veterinary Institute, Norway. NORM / NORM-VET 2020 ZOONOTIC enteropathogenic bacteria represent a considerable public health problem. Furthermore, the occurrence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in such bacteria represents a major public health concern. Therefore, it is of great importance to monitor the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic and other enteropathogenic bacteria at relevant stages in the farm-to- fork continuum. Salmonella isolates from control programmes concerning feed samples, animals and food products, as well as diagnostic samples from animals are monitored for antimicrobial resistance every year. In addition, Campylobacter spp. from broiler and turkey were included in 2020. Bacteria recovered from human clinical specimens including Salmonella , Shigella, Yersinia enterocolitica and a representative selection of Campylobacter spp. are included for monitoring of antimicrobial resistance. Sampling, laboratory methods and data processing are described in Appendix 4. SALMONELLA SPP. Salmonella from animals The situation regarding occurrence of Salmonella spp. in food production animals in Norway is very favourable as such animal populations are considered virtually free from Salmonella spp. To document and maintain this favourable situation, Norway runs an extensive surveillance programme that covers both live animals (cattle, pigs and poultry) and meat samples. The Salmonella isolates examined in NORM-VET include those that are detected in this programme, as well as isolates detected by clinical submissions to the Norwegian Veterinary Institute. The data are presented in Table 16 and in the text. TABLE 16. Antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella spp. (n=33) other Salmonella spp. (n=10) in 2020.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS In 2020, a total of 33 Salmonella spp. isolates from animals were susceptibility tested. In total, 23 of these isolates were S. Typhimurium including one each from eight cats, five wild boars, four cattle, four dogs, one pig and one chicken, respectively. The remaining ten isolates belonged to eight different serovars; one isolate each of S. Agona, S. Umbilo, S. Hessarek, and S. enterica subsp. diarizonae from cattle, one isolate each of S. Derby and S. enterica subsp. diarizonae from swine, and two isolates of S. enterica subsp. diarizonae and one isolate each of S. bongori and S. enterica subsp. enterica from wild boars. Nine of the isolates were fully susceptible to all antimicrobial classes tested for, 21 were resistant to one (mainly colistin) and three isolates from cattle ( S. Typhimurium) were resistant to five different antimicrobial classes (tetracyclines, amphenicols, penicillins with extended spectrum, sulfonamides and quinolones). The colistin resistant isolates were subjected to whole genome sequencing for further characterisation of the responsible resistance mechanisms. No acquired resistance genes nor point mutations were found. Due to differences in natural susceptibility to colistin among serovars, there is no general Salmonella ECOFF, and these isolates should therefore probably be considered susceptible to colistin. ZOONOTIC AND NON-ZOONOTIC ENTEROPATHOGENIC BACTERIA NORM / NORM-VET 2020 68 Salmonella from human clinical specimens In 2020, 439 human cases of nontyphoidal salmonellosis and 7 cases of typhoid fever were notified to the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Disease (MSIS). The majority of these cases were infected abroad (40%). The National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for Entero- pathogenic Bacteria at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) received 412 unique Salmonella isolates from primary diagnostic laboratories in Norway. All isolates were screened for antimicrobial resistance determinants following whole genome sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on all Salmonella Typhimurium, Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A isolates, and based on information at the point of reception, all other non-travel associated Salmonella isolates. In addition, antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on all Salmonella isolates recovered from blood cultures. Information on place of acquisition was completed and updated for all isolates by data from MSIS. A total of 354 unique Salmonella spp. isolates were tested (Table 17). All isolates were susceptibility tested against six antibiotic antimicrobial susceptibility tested Salmonella isolates recoved from human clinical specimens in Norway 2020, by serovar and place of acquisition.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS Following the reorganisation of the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for Enteropathogenic Bacteria at the NIPH and paused antimicrobial susceptibility testing for 2018, the NRL resumed antimicrobial susceptibility testing for a selection of the received Salmonella isolates from 2019. Selection criteria were set to ensure inclusion of important Salmonella serovars and antibiotics for the monitoring of emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in Norway. Additionally, in 2020 the NRL screened all submitted Salmonella isolates for antimicrobial resistance determinants following whole genome sequencing to identify genotypic resistance. For S. Typhimurium isolates, overall resistance rates were higher for travel-associated strains when compared to domestically acquired strains. A stable decreasing trend in resistance to tetracycline and chloramphenicol irrespective of place of acquisition was observed. A single isolate was identified as susceptible to extended-spectrum chephalo- sporins, genotypic resistance confirmed the presence of blaCTX-M-1 gene. For the monophasic variant of the S. Typhimurium, overall resistance rates are higher than for S. Typhimurium. We observed stable resistance rates over the last five years for the tested antibiotics, although resistance rates are high for both ampicillin and tetracycline, in both domestically acquired and travel-associated strains. Few isolates were identified as resistant to ciprofloxacin, genotypic resistance confirmed the presence of plasmid-mediated qnrS1 gene in these isolates. Antibiotic resistance in S. Enteritidis in generally low, and has been reported low over a long period. An apparent sudden emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance in 2016 was linked to the change in antibiotic used for screening fluoroquinolone resistance from ciprofloxacin to pefloxacin. Screening for genotypic resistance confirmed the presence of mutations in gyrA known to confer resistance to ciprofloxacin. 0 2 4 6 8 10S. ENTEROPATHOGENIC BACTERIA 77The overall prevalence of antibiotic resistance in S. Typhi is high, with an observed rising trend for resistance against extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was also a characteristic feature of a considerable proportion of the S. Typhi isolates (42.9%). The MDR phenotype in S. Typhi resistance ampicillins, fluoroquinolones, extended-spectrum cephalosporins and phenicols. Screening for genotypic resistance confirmed the presence of the blaCTX-M-15 gene in all MDR isolates. In total, seven isolates were genotypically resistant to ( Typhi (n=3), S. Typimurium (n=1) and S. Amsterdam (n=1)) were susceptibility tested and four displayed phenotypic resistance. Six were classified as ESBL A, encoding different blaCTX-M genes, and one was classified as ESBL M, encoding blaDHA-1. The overall sensitivity of phenotypic versus genotypic resistance ranged between 80-100% for the selected antibiotics. Lowest sensitivity was recorded for extended- spectrum cephalosporins, where one isolate was categorised as phenotypic WT when encoding the blaDHA-1 gene. Gene expression analysis was not performed to confirm this discrepancy. The overall specificity of phenotypic versus genotypic resistance ranged between 90.6-99.7% for the selected antibiotics. Lowest specificity was recorded for tetracycline, where no known resistance determinants were identified for thirty phenotypic NWT isolates. All but three of these isolates displayed low level of resistance (zone 12 mm), with a median inhibition zone of 15 mm (disc diffusion). CAMPYLOBACTER SPP. Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli from broilers and turkey Caecal samples from a total of 113 broiler flocks were examined. These were flocks identified as Campylobacter positive in the surveillance programme for Campylobacter spp. in broiler flocks in Norway in 2020, or flocks that for some reasons had not been tested in the Campylobacter surveillance programme. In total the Campylobacter surveillance programme examined 1,893 flocks from 490 producers (Pettersen et al. 2021). C. jejuni isolates were obtained from 92 of the 113 flocks, and 87 of these were susceptibility tested. Only four Campylobacter coli were identified. In addition, caecal samples from 117 turkey flocks were examined. C. jejuni isolates were obtained from five flocks (4.3%) and C. coli from only one flock (0.8%). The isolates were susceptibility tested, and the results fro C. jejuni are presented in Table 30, Figures 60-61 and in the text. The results for C. coli are not shown in table and figure due to few isolates. TABLE 30. Antimicrobial resistance in Campylobacter jejuni from broiler (n=87) in 2020.

Proportions of isolates susceptible to all (blue), or resistant to one (red) or two (green) antimicrobial classes are illustrated. RESULTS AND COMMENTS BROILER The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among C. jejuni isolates from Norwegian broilers is low. In total, 90.8% of the 87 isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents included in the test panel. Resistance to one antimicrobial class was detected in 6.9% of the isolates, while resistance to two antimicrobial classes was detected in 2.3% of the isolates. Only four isolates of C. coli were detected, and resistance to streptomycin was detected in one of these. Among the C. jejuni isolates, resistance to quinolones (i.e. ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid) were the most frequently identified resistance determinants, closely followed by resistance to streptomycin. The 2016 results indicated an increasing trend in prevalence of resistance since 2007. This was mainly due to an observed increase in resistance to quinolones. The 2018 and 2020 results, however, show that the fraction of resistant isolates has decreased after 2016 (Figure 60), and that this is due to a decrease in resistance both to quinolones and tetracyclines (Figure 60). An increase in resistance to quinolones, as well as tetracyclines and streptomycins, in C. jejuni from broilers is observed in several of the countries reporting to EFSA (EFSA and ECDC Summary Report 2018/2019). In a European perspective, the occurrence of resistance in C. jejuni (including quinolone resistance) from Norwegian broilers is quite low, although the occurrence varies between countries reporting to EFSA with the Nordic countries having the lowest resistance rates. Further monitoring is needed to follow the situation in Norway in the years to come. TURKEY In total, four of the five C. jejuni isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents included in the test panel. One isolate displayed resistance to streptomycin. The single C. coli isolate was fully susceptible. Campylobacter spp. from turkey caecal samples have only been susceptibility tested twice before, in 2007 and 2018. All these three years, there has been a limited number of isolates and comparisons are therefore not possible. The data show that there is a low prevalence of Campylobacter in turkey. In a European perspective, the overall prevalences of resistance to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline in C. jejuni from turkey are very high, while resistance to erythromycin, streptomycin and gentamicin are low to very low according to the EFSA classification described in Appendix 6. Complete susceptibility was observed for only 17.2% of the isolates reported by European countries in 2018 (EFSA and ECDC Summary Report 2018). Compared to these European data, the occurrence of resistance in C. jejuni from turkey flocks in Norway is among the lowest. 75 80 85 90 95 100Broiler 2007Broiler 2008Broiler 2011Broiler 2013Broiler ZOONOTIC AND NON-ZOONOTIC ENTEROPATHOGENIC BACTERIA 79Campylobacter spp. from human clinical cases In 2020, 2,422 human campylobacteriosis cases were notified to MSIS.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS Following the reorganisation of the NRL for Enteropathogenic Bacteria at the NIPH and paused antimicrobial susceptibility testing for 2018, the NRL resumed antimicrobial susceptibility testing for all C. jejuni and C. coli isolates received in 2019. For the C. jejuni isolates, overall resistance rates against ciprofloxacin and tetracycline were higher for travel- associated strains when compared to domestically acquired strains. Resistance in C. coli follow similar patterns as C. jejuni, although C. coli were observed to be more resistant to erythromycin. An MDR phenotype was observed in 21 isolates, 16 C. jejuni and five C. coli. All, but three isolates were associated to travel. MDR was recorded against all tested antibiotic classes in three isolates, and to fluoroquinolones, tetracycline and macrolides in 15 isolates.

Additionally, in 2020 the NRL screened all submitted Shigella spp. isolates for antimicrobial resistance following whole genome sequencing to identify genotypic resistance. Antimicrobial resistance profiles and trends are only presented for S. sonnei and S. flexneri. A stable and high proportion (81.8%) of S. sonnei were observed resistant to tetracycline over the last decade. In addition, an increasing trend of resistance towards ciprofloxacin was recorded. Also, in S. flexneri a stable and high proportion of isolates were observed resistant to tetracycline over the last decade (83.1%). In addition, a high proportion of S. flexneri isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol and ampicillin. An increasing trend of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was observed in 2020. Three S. flexneri and two S. sonnei isolates displayed reduced susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. All were classified as ESBL A, encoding blaCTX-M-15. In additional, one S. flexneri isolate also encoded blaDHA-1. The overall sensitivity of phenotypic versus genotypic resistance ranged between 61-100% for the selected antibiotics. Lowest sensitivity was recorded for fluoro- quinolones, where seven isolates categorised as phenotypic WT were identified as genotypically resistant. Six of these isolates encoded a qnr gene (qnrS1: n=4), whereas all isolates that were phenotypically resistant were identified with known mutations in the gyrA gene conferring quinolone resistance. When using pefloxacin to infer ciprofloxacin resistance, we could correctly identify ciprofloxacin resistance for six of these seven isolates. The overall specificity of phenotypic versus genotypic resistance ranged between 57-100% for the selected antibiotics. Lowest specificity was recorded for tetra- cycline, where no known resitance genes were identified in three isolates. NORM / NORM-VET 2020 HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES 89 HUMAN CLINICAL bacterial species in blood cultures Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance is usually based on prevalences of reduced susceptibility and resistance to certain combinations of antimicrobials and bacterial species in clinical samples. The NORM surveillance programme generally follows this approach. However, there is a serious limitation to the model because a transition in the distribution from susceptible bacterial species to inherently more resistant ones will represent de facto emergence of resistance which is not easily detected. In order to complement the surveillance of individual species, NORM collects data on all positive blood cultures from the laboratory information systems of the participating institutions. A patient with a given microbial isolate was excluded from registration with a new isolate of the same species within a month from the first entry. This rule was applied irrespectively of changes in the organism\u00b4s susceptibility pattern. Isolates of a different species from the same patient were included in the surveillance. It proved difficult to systematically evaluate the clinical significance of species which are commonly part of the normal skin flora. In Table 45, proportions are therefore estimated for all isolates and for all isolates excluding species considered to be common skin contaminants such as coagulase negative staphylococci, Cutibacterium spp. This does not imply that such isolates cannot cause infections, but only that it was not possible to enforce a standardised protocol for inclusion of the clinically significant isolates. Similarly, all isolates were registered as individual findings although polymicrobial bloodstream infections are regularly detected in some patients. Limitations in the data extraction procedure prohibited in-depth analysis of these parameters. TABLE 45.

The predominance of Gram-positives among all isolates was at the same level as in previous years. The most common Gram-positive species were coagulase negative staphylococci, which represented 20.4%. This is an increase from 18.7% in 2019, but minor fluctuations may result from inconsistent reporting from the laboratories. The difference between aerobic Gram-positives and Gram- negatives was reversed when species of the skin flora (coagulase negative and 53.6% aerobic Gram-negatives. Among aerobic Gram-positives, the prevalence of S. pneumoniae steadily declined from 12.1% in 2005 to 4.0% in 2019 (skin contaminants excluded), following the introduction of the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in the national childhood immunisation programme in June 2006. A further reduction to 2.1% in 2020 may be linked to the on-going coronavirus pandemic with reduced incidence of all respiratory tract pathogens. The reduction corresponds to a drop from 604 cases in 2019 to 300 cases in 2020. The proportions of other aerobic Gram-positives have remained stable over many years. E. coli (32.0%) and other Enterobacteriaceae (16.9%) accounted for the vast majority of aerobic Gram-negative isolates, but the proportions have remained relatively unchanged over the years. Pseudomonas spp. (2.4%) has been fairly stable after a peak in 2005 (2.8%), all figures excluding skin flora. Anaerobic bacteria and yeasts were less prevalent. Anaerobes accounted for 6.4% (7.8% excluding skin flora). Yeasts accounted for 1.2% (1.5% excluding skin flora), which is unchanged from earlier years. The major pathogens among anaerobes were members of Bacteroides spp. (2.2%/2.9%) and among yeasts Candida albicans (0.7%/1.0%). However, a multitude of other species were also represented. FIGURE 71.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS NORM results are interpreted according to NordicAST/ EUCAST clinical breakpoints at the time of analysis and categorised as susceptible with standard exposure (S), susceptible with increased exposure (I), or resistant (R). The vast majority of isolates were susceptible (S or I) to broad-spectrum agents 46). There were no significant changes in resistance rates from 2019-2020. The prevalence of resistance to gentamicin increased slightly to 6.7% in 2020 compared to 5.4% in 2018 and 5.9% in 2019 (Figure 72). The data were interpreted according to the breakpoints for systemic urinary tract infections, although NordicAST/EUCAST no longer consider gentamicin sufficient for monotherapy in infections originating from other sources. A high proportion of gentamicin resistant isolates (55/139, 39.6%) also produced ESBL enzymes. The prevalence at individual laboratories varied due to relatively small numbers. When aggregated by region there were only minor geographical differences (South-East 7.6%, North 6.5%, West 5.5% and Middle 5.0%). Tobramycin and amikacin were surveyed to broaden the perspective on aminoglycoside resistance. Both substances displayed widespread susceptibility of 92.3% and 96.7%, respectively. The prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin was 11.2% in 2020 compared to 11.3% in 2019. The breakpoint for ciprofloxacin resistance has been changed many times over the years, most recently in 2017 with a reduction from R > 1 mg/L to R > 0.5 mg/L and from S 0.5 mg/L to S 0.25 mg/L. The long-term trend for ciprofloxacin resistance cannot be precisely determined due to changes in susceptibility test methodology, but it appears that the increase seen 2006-2017 has now stabilised when using the present breakpoint. The temporal association between ciprofloxacin resistance and ciprofloxacin usage is depicted in Figure 73. A similar association between quinolone use and resistance in systemic E. coli isolates is also reported internationally. The resistance rates for ampicillin (43.3% in 2019, 41.6% in 2020) and trimethoprim-sulfa- methoxazole (24.6% in 2019, 23.1% in 2020) are stable. Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) was based on reduced zone diameters for cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime. All isolates with reduced susceptibility were further characterised by combination MIC gradient tests. A total of 136 isolates (6.5%) were reported as ESBL positive, which is a slight reduction from 2019 (7.1%) (Figure 75). The isolates originated from laboratories across the country, and estimates at local level are uncertain due to small numbers. When aggregated at regional level there was some geographical variation in the prevalence of ESBL production; South-East (7.3%), North (6.9%), West (6.4%) Most of the ESBL piperacillin-tazobactam (n=116). Forty-nine isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid using breakpoints for non- urinary tract infections, whereas 87 were resistant. The ESBL isolates displayed high rates of co-resistance to isolates remained susceptible to amikacin (45/55). All isolates were fully susceptible to meropenem according to clinical breakpoints, but 21 isolates (1.0%) had zone diameters less than the screening breakpoint of 28 mm and required further examination. A single OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing isolate was detected. HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES NORM / NORM-VET 2020 92 FIGURE 72.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS Urinary tract isolates of E. coli have been included in the surveillance programme every year since NORM was established in 2000. The prevalence of resistance for 2020 is shown in Table 47 and the rates of resistance for 2000- 2020 are shown in Figure 74. The results for amoxicillin- clavulanic acid and fosfomycin are interpreted according to the EUCAST/NordicAST breakpoints specific for un- complicated urinary tract infections. The prevalence of resistance among urinary tract isolates has remained relatively stable over the last ten years, but is slowly increasing for most antibiotics. The prevalence of resistance to ampicillin has gradually increased from approximately 25% to 38%. Resistance to trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has remained stable around 20-25%. The prevalence of resistance to mecillinam was 5.3% in 2020 compared to 4.4% in 2018 and 3.9% in 2019. Susceptibility testing of mecillinam can be methodo- logically challenging. Ciprofloxacin is used as a second- line agent for urinary tract infections in Norway. When adjusting for changes in breakpoint (see legend Figure 73), the prevalence of resistance has remained stable around 8- 9% over the last five years. In 2020, 8.1% of the isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin in addition to 2.8% that were only susceptible to increased exposure through adjustment of dosage or higher concentration at the site of infection. The corresponding rates for blood culture isolates were 11.2% resistance and 3.1% susceptibility to increased exposure. The persistent discrepancy between urinary tract isolates and isolates from bloodstream infections suggests that systemic infections are caused by selected pathogenic lineages with increased virulence and accumulation of mutations in gyrase and/or topoisomerase genes, whereas urinary tract isolates may be more representative of the wildtype normal flora. The prevalence of resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was 8.0% in 2020 compared to 4.4% in 2018 and 6.4% in 2019. The breakpoint used (R > 32 mg/L) is only valid for uncomplicated urinary tract infections. Almost all isolates (99.0%) remained susceptible to nitrofurantoin. Fosfo- mycin has been included in NORM since 2017. The vast majority of isolates were categorised as susceptible (96.4%), but the analysis may be technically challenging for inexperienced personnel and the results should be interpreted with caution. Eighty-five isolates (3.4%) were reported as ESBL producers. This is at the same level as 3.7% in 2018 and 3.0% in 2019. As seen in Figure 75, the prevalence of E. coli ESBL is still lower in urine than in blood culture isolates (6.5%). The ESBL positive strains were isolated at 19 different laboratories in all parts of the country. Fifty- eight isolates were retrieved from samples submitted by general practitioners, while the others were found in hospitalised patients (n=12) or patients in nursing homes (n=6), outpatient clinics (n=7) or unspecified locations (n=2). The ESBL isolates were all resistant to ampicillin, and the majority were also resistant to cefotaxime (82/85) and ceftazidime (57/85). Almost all isolates (80/85) were registered as in vitro susceptible to mecillinam. Recent data suggest that this may be a viable treatment option provided a dosage of 400 mg x 3. Many of the ESBL isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (47/85), trimethoprim (67/85). All ESBL isolates were clinically susceptible to carbapenems. Twelve isolates had zone diameters below the meropenem screening breakpoint of 28 mm, but most of these were susceptible to piperacillin- tazobactam. A single isolate containing an OXA-48 like carbapenemase was detected. HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES NORM / NORM-VET 2020 94 FIGURE 74.

Table 48 presents the resistance rates of urinary tract E. coli by location of sampling. Overall, there is no clear pattern with higher or lower occurrence of resistance in certain locations. Mecillinam resistance is apparently more common in nursing homes (10.1%) than in hospital (7.9%) and general practitioner (4.3%) patients, and fosfomycin resistance is surprisingly high among urinary tract isolates from nursing homes (10.1%). There in no obvious reason for this difference in terms of antibiotic usage pattern, and it may be due to selective sampling of refractory or recurrent infections. For antibiotics commonly used for uncomplicated (trimethoprim, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxa- zole and nitrofurantoin) or complicated (ciprofloxacin) urinary tract infections there are only minor differences. 051015202530354045 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 / NORM-VET 2020 HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES 95 FIGURE 75. Prevalence of ESBL production among Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. isolates from blood and urine 2003-2020. A nationwide, longitudinal, microbial population genomic study of Escherichia coli causing bloodstream infections in Norway in 2002-17 Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance has multiple purposes including identifying the extent of the problem, monitoring changes over time, guidance of empirical therapy, identification of emerging resistance phenotypes/genotypes and devising intervention or prevention strategies. Surveillance systems also provide a valuable resource for in-depth research on specific topics. However, there are several limitations for the use of surveillance data in research such as the use of different protocols/methods for susceptibility testing, data only from sentinel sites and lack of storage and access to isolates. Moreover, current surveillance systems frequently do not include molecular typing methodologies like whole genome sequencing which offer the possibility to investigate emergence of \"high-risk\" clones, specific resistance/virulence determinants and population structure changes over time. Escherichia coli associated with bloodstream infections is a subset of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) which constitutes a diverse set of clones (1). Previous studies have shown that a small number of globally disseminated ExPEC clones are responsible for most infections and that specific clones like CC131 are associated with multi-drug resistance (1,2). In Norway, bloodstream infections caused by E. coli have been increasing as well as the prevalence of ESBL-producing and fluoroquinolone non-susceptible E. coli (3). To investigate the clonal diversity underpinning the trends in multi-drug resistant E. coli, we took advantage of the strengths of the NORM surveillance system which includes nationwide coverage, standardised protocols and storage of isolates by participating laboratories. In collaboration with 15 out of 22 laboratories, 3,397 E. coli bloodstream isolates from 2002-17 were collected and 3,254 were successfully sequenced, representing the largest genomic survey of E. coli to date. This allowed us to investigate the clonal diversity, emergence of clones and their contribution to increasing rates of bloodstream infections and antimicrobial resistance in Norway and compare it with other countries. The results from the study show that E. coli causing bloodstream infection in Norway are relatively diverse (Figure 76), represented by the identification of 136 clonal groups, but that four clones, CC73, CC95, CC69 and CC131 are most common representing 54.1% of the population. All four clones are well-known globally disseminated clones with various degrees of association to antimicrobial resistance (1). Using 2002 as a baseline, CC131 showed the largest proportional sustained increase in the collection. CC131 is a known high-risk clone associated with ESBL production and fluoroquinolone resistance (4). Concurrently, we observed that CC131 was the single largest contributor to ESBL production and fluoroquinolone non- susceptibility in the collection. Fifty-nine percent of blaCTX-M positive isolates and 39.2% of ciprofloxacin non-susceptible isolates belonged to CC131. CC131 can be delineated into multiple clades (e.g. A, B, C1 and C2) with different associations with antimicrobial resistance (4). As expected, the multi-drug resistant C2 clade was most strongly associated with ESBL production with 72.5% of the isolates being blaCTX-M positive compared to 40% of clade C1 and 14.7% of clade A isolates. A similar scenario was observed for fluoroquinolone non-susceptibility. This shows that the globally disseminated \"high-risk\" CC131 clone is the main contributor to the increase in multi-drug resistant E. coli bloodstream infections in Norway. 012345678 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020% of spp., blood E. coli, urine Klebsiella spp., urine HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES NORM / NORM-VET 2020 96 To investigate in more detail the expansion of CC131 we estimated the effective population sizes and rates of expansion of the CC131 clades. Interestingly, we observed a higher effective population size and growth rate of the predominantly susceptible clade A compared to the more resistant clades C1 and C2. We also found that clade A was established in 2002 while clade C2 emerged in 2007. This is in contrast to data from a UK longitudinal study (2) where clade C2 dominated. Moreover, the increase in CC131 in Norway was a gradual process compared to a more rapid expansion in the UK. The data also show that contributions of the different clades to resistance in the countries are different. Finally, the modelling indicated that expansion of the susceptible clade B happened already a decade earlier compared to the other clades. Overall, this indicates that acquisition of resistance is not a prerequisite for clonal success but that other factors are also contributing. FIGURE 76. Species-wide phylogeny of the collection coloured according to clonal groups. Interactive view is available at: https://microreact.org/project/EcoliBSINorway/14b916b0. The study highlights the possibilities of surveillance structures for genomic surveillance studies to elucidate the ecology underlying the expansion of multi-drug resistance and that the epidemiology of E. coli is variable between countries. These observations have implications for our efforts to implement strategies and interventions to control the spread of high-risk multi-drug resistant clones.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS The surveillance of Klebsiella spp. in blood cultures included 632 K. pneumoniae (65.4%), 237 K. oxytoca (24.5%), and 98 (10.1%) isolates not identified to the species level, giving a total of 967 Klebsiella spp. isolates (Tables 49-51). The majority of Klebsiella spp. isolates was susceptible to aminoglycosides, and the prevalence of gentamicin resistance remained stable at 5.2% compared to 5.2% in 2018 and 4.4% in 2019. The prevalence of resistance to tobramycin was 5.9%, whereas almost all isolates (99.0%) were susceptible to amikacin. K. pneumoniae isolates were more often resistant to gentamicin (7.0%) than K. oxytoca isolates (2.5%). Aminoglycoside resistance in common Enterobacterales species is a cause for great concern as these antimicrobials have traditionally been used in the empirical regimen for treatment of septicemia in Norway. As for E. coli, the breakpoints for ciprofloxacin were reduced from R > 1 mg/L to R > 0.5 mg/L and from S 0.5 to S 0.25 in 2017. The prevalence of resistance to cipro- floxacin peaked at 11-12% in 2016-2017, but decreased to 6.1% in 2019 and 8.1% in 2020. The results should be interpreted with caution due to the repeated changes in breakpoints and test methodology over the last decade. Susceptibility testing for quinolones may be technically challenging, and further surveillance is needed to determine the long-term trend for ciprofloxacin resistance in Klebsiella spp. Resistance to ciprofloxacin is much more common in K. pneumoniae (11.6%) than in K. oxytoca (1.7%). Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole increased from 11.3% in 2019 to 12.2% in 2020. As for ciprofloxacin, the prevalence of resistance to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole was significantly lower in K. oxytoca (7.2%) than in K. pneumoniae (15.5%). A comparison of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics between Klebsiella species is complicated by the diagnostic challenges of the chromosomal K1 beta-lactamase in K. oxytoca. Most Klebsiella piperacillin-tazobactam (88.8%), see Figure 77. The prevalence of resistance to 3rd generation cephalo- sporins increased by approximately one percentage point from 2019-2020. The increased resistance to piperacillin- tazobactam (4.4% in 2019, 11.2% in 2020) was mainly due to a reduction of the breakpoint for resistance from R > 16 mg/L to R > 8 mg/L. As for E. coli, the detection of extended-spectrum beta- lactamases (ESBL) was based on zone diameters of cefotaxime and ceftazidime disks. Isolates with reduced zone diameters were further characterised by combination MIC gradient tests. The prevalence of phenotypically confirmed ESBL isolates increased from 5.7% in 2019 to 7.2% in 2020 (9.7% in K. pneumonia ), the highest prevalence ever recorded in NORM (Figure 75).

RESULTS AND COMMENTS Klebsiella spp. urinary tract isolates have previously been included in the NORM surveillance programme in 2001, 2003, 2009 and 2012-2019. Due to methodological changes it is not possible to directly compare the results from 2001 and 2003 with the ones from later surveys. There are no Klebsiella spp. disk diffusion breakpoints for fosfomycin or nitrofurantoin. The prevalence of resistance to urinary tract antibiotics was slightly lower in Klebsiella spp. than in E. coli isolates (Tables 52-54). The majority of isolates remained susceptible to gentamicin at 96.2% compared to 96.6% in 2019. Among urinary tract E. coli, 96.0% were susceptible to gentamicin in 2020. The rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin in Klebsiella spp. increased from 4.2% in 2019 to 6.1% in 2020. The comparable rate for urinary tract E. coli in 2020 was 8.1%.

Our data may indicate that the E. coli breakpoints for fosfomycin are not suitable for Klebsiella (72.7% resistance). All Klebsiella isolates are inherently resistant to ampicillin due to the chromosomal SHV beta-lactamase. As for Klebsiella spp. blood culture isolates, ESBL detection in urinary tract isolates was based on resistance to cefotaxime and/or ceftazidime and subsequent confirmatory ESBL MIC gradient tests. Forty-five isolates (4.5%) were reported as ESBL positive, of which 40 were K. pneumoniae , four were K. oxytoca , and one was not identified to the species level. They were retrieved from 17 different laboratories and originated from general practices (n=20), hospitals (n=14), outpatient clinics (n=4), nursing homes (n=4) or other locations The 4.5% ESBL rate (5.7% in K. pneumoniae ) from 2019 for all , 4.2% in K. pneumoniae ). (n=38) and piperacillin-tazobactam (n=22). Two isolates were categorised as R and I to meropenem according to the clinical breakpoints, but only the latter was confirmed to contain a carbapenemase determinant (KPC). No additional carbapenemase-producing isolates were detected by the screening breakpoint. TABLE 53. Klebsiella pneumoniae urinary tract isolates in 2020 (n=699).

NORM / NORM-VET 2020 HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES 101 Carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria in Norway 2020 Carbapenem resistance is a major contributor to the burden of antimicrobial resistance (1) mainly due to the global spread of carbapenemases associated with mobile genetic elements. In Norway, colonisation or infections with carbapenemase- producing Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas sp. and Acinetobacter sp.) are notifiable to the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS). Confirmation and characterisation of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negatives is performed at the Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Detection of Antimicrobial Resistance. Here we summarise the findings in 2020. 57 cases of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) were identified in 2020 (Figure 78). This is a reduction from 75 cases in 2019 and at a similar level as 2018 (n=54). FIGURE 78. Number of cases with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales in Norway 2007-2020. More than one CPE isolate, of either different species or the same species but different sequence type (ST)/carbapenemase gene, were identified in five cases leading to a total of 62 CPE isolates. The number of Escherichia coli in 2020 (n=45) was the same as in 2019 (n=44), while the number of Klebsiella pneumoniae went down from 28 isolates in 2019 to 13 isolates in 2020 (Figure 79). Two carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter sp. and single isolates of carbapenemase-producing Proteus mirabilis and Kluyvera sp. were identified. In terms carbapenemase variants the number of isolates with OXA-48-like variants was stable with 36 isolates in 2020 versus 35 in 2019 (Figure 80). In contrast, the number of isolates with NDM declined from 46 isolates in 2019 to 22 isolates in 2020. Two isolates harboured more than one carbapenemase - one K. pneumoniae with NDM-5 and OXA-232 and one E. coli with NDM-5 and KPC-3. FIGURE 79.

HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES NORM / NORM-VET 2020 102 FIGURE 80. Number of carbapenemase variants among Enterobacterales isolates. In general, genetic analysis showed a relatively large diversity in terms of ST and carbapenemase variants. Nineteen different STs were identified among the 45 E. coli isolates (Table 55). TABLE 55. Sequence type (ST) and carbapenemase variant combinations among carbapenemase-producing E. coli (n=45) identified was E. coli ST38-OXA-244 identified in 19 cases. In addition, E. coli ST38-OXA-48 was identified in two cases. Phylogenetic analysis showed two clusters of closely related E. coli ST38-OXA-244 (Figure 81). The largest cluster represents an outbreak in the Western Health Region that involved three hospitals and 12 cases. Six isolates were from clinical specimens while six isolates were identified through screening. The second cluster of two cases was identified at the same laboratory with an approximately two-month interval. Epidemiological data did not reveal any relationship that could link the cases. The combination of E. coli ST38 and OXA-244 has emerged as a high-risk clone with increasing prevalence in Europe (2) and dissemination has been shown in several countries and across borders (3-6). OXA-244 is a one amino acid variant of OXA-48 which leads to reduced activity towards temocillin and carbapenems (7). This leads to diagnostic challenges in terms of phenotypic identification and screening approaches for the identification of OXA-244 producers (6, 8). No other closely related clusters of isolates were observed, but several of the identified STs belong to pandemic high-risk clones of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC); ST69, ST131, ST167, ST405 and ST648 (9). 0102030405060708090100 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020No. of isolates / NORM-VET 2020 HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES 103 FIGURE 81.

The isolates are coloured according to laboratory. Closely related isolates (10 allelic distance) are highlighted with grey shading. The 13 carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae represented nine STs and five different carbapenemase variants (Table 56 and Figure 82). K. pneumoniae ST392-OXA-48 (n=3) and K. pneumoniae ST147-OXA-232 (n=2) were the only ST- carbapenemase variant combinations identified in more than one case. Epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis confirmed nosocomial transmission for two K. pneumoniae ST392-OXA-48 cases. The last case was identified in another health region and was not genetically related. K. pneumoniae ST392-OXA-48 has previously been identified in Norway and Sweden associated with import from Gran Canaria (10). The two K. pneumoniae ST392-OXA-48 cases were identified in two different laboratories and were not genetically related. As for E. coli, several of the STs identified belong to known high-risk clones (e.g. ST15, ST101, ST147, ST258, ST340 and ST392) associated with the dissemination of carbapenemases (11, 12).

HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES NORM / NORM-VET 2020 104 Four other carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales isolates were identified in 2020 compared to 14 in 2019 (Table 57). The Enterobacter sp. ST93-NDM-5 isolate was identified in a patient co-harbouring K. pneumoniae ST252-NDM-5. Both isolates harboured the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene mcr-9.1, but were susceptible to colistin. It is known that some mcr-variants including mcr-9.1 do not confer clinical colistin resistance (13). TABLE 57. Sequence type (ST) and carbapenemase variant combinations identified among carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter sp., Kluyvera sp. and P. mirabilis established. Four cases of carbapenemase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified in 2020 (Figure 83) which is at the same level as in previous years (2-7 cases/year). All cases were from clinical samples and associated with import. Four different ST- carbapenemase variant combinations were identified (ST111-NDM-1, ST348-IMP-8, ST773-NDM-1 and 83. Norway 2004-2020. Ten cases of carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii were identified in 2020, a reduction from 23 in 2019 (Figure 83). Six isolates belonged to the globally dominating ST2 clone (14), all harbouring OXA-23. OXA-23 was also identified in three other isolates, one ST1 isolate co-harbouring NDM-1, one ST16 isolate and one with a novel ST. OXA-72 (OXA-24/- 40-variant) was identified in one ST1122 isolate. The isolates were submitted from seven different laboratories and association with import has been indicated for nine cases. Phylogenetic analysis showed that none of the isolates were closely related. Conclusion A reduction in the number of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negatives was observed in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline is likely linked to the travel restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic as cases of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negatives are frequently associated with import (15, 16). The observation is in line with reduction in other notifiable infectious diseases (17). Whole genome sequencing identified a diversity of clones and carbapenemase variants, including representatives of pandemic clones associated with specific carbapenemase variants (e.g. E. coli ST38-OXA-244, P. aeruginosa ST111-NDM-1 and A. baumannii ST2-OXA-23). This shows that Norway takes part in the global dissemination of antibiotic resistance. With the exception of the E. coli ST38-OXA-244 outbreak, only a few single cases of probable clonal spread in Norway were observed. Thus, there is no clear evidence of regional or interregional spread. 05101520253035 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020No. of isolates Year Acinetobacter spp. Pseudomonas spp. NORM / NORM-VET 2020 HUMAN References: 1.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS Systemic H. influenzae isolates were first included in the NORM surveillance programme in 2013. Resistance data are provided by the Reference Laboratory at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health on a yearly basis, but analysis was limited 2018-2019 due to reorganisation of the laboratory. In 2020, 43 H. influenzae isolates were recovered from blood cultures (n=39) and unspecified specimens (n=4). One of the latter was also isolated in a blood culture, but the others represented unique patients (Tables 58-59). The results should be interpreted with caution due to a low number of isolates. Beta-lactamase production was detected in only 2/43 isolates (4.7%), which is substantially lower than in 2016 (17.3%) and 2017 (17.8%). Cefuroxime MIC > 2 mg/L has been suggested as the most precise indicator for chromosomal beta-lactam resistance encoded by alterations in the wildtype PBP3 sequence. Five isolates (11.6%) displayed this phenotype compared to 16.1% in 2017. Some of these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin (2/5) and/or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (3/5). All cefuroxime resistant isolates were beta-lactamase negative. One isolate was resistant to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (both MIC 0.25 mg/L), whereas two additional isolates displayed high-level resistance to ceftriaxone (32 mg/L) but remained susceptible to cefotaxime. All isolates remained fully susceptible to meropenem according to EUCAST/NordicAST non-meningitis breakpoints, but a single isolate (MIC 0.5 mg/L) would have been classified as meropenem resistant in menigitis. Different substrates have been suggested for screening of beta-lactam resistance in H. influenzae . The penicillin G 1U (PCG1) successfully identified all ampicillin (n=7) and cefuroxime (n=5) resistant isolates. Eighteen out of 41 (43.9%) beta-lactamase negative isolates were resistant to PCG1. Five of these isolates were resistant to both ampicillin and cefuroxime, and only five isolates remained fully susceptible to both agents. As seen in previous surveys of systemic H. influenzae isolates, resistance to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol was at very low levels (all 0.0%). The 30.2% resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was an increase compared to 15.3% in 2017.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS N. meningitidis from blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluids were first included in NORM in 2013. The Reference Laboratory at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health provides data for N. meningitidis on a yearly basis. The EUCAST/NordicAST breakpoint for susceptibility to penicillin G was increased to S 0.25 in 2020, thus eliminating the I category. The results are presented in Tables 60-61. Only five cases of systemic infections caused by N. meningitidis were reported in 2020. This is the lowest number of reported cases in Norway since surveillance was initiated in 1977, and must be seen in context with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic through most of the year. Four isolates were available for further analysis. All isolates were from unique patients and there were no known associations between the cases. The isolates belonged to serogroups B (n=2) and Y (n=2). The serogroup Y isolates belonged to the ST-23 clonal complex while the two serogroup B isolates belonged to two different clonal complexes, the ST-32 and ST-41/44 clonal complexes. One isolate displayed a penicillin G MIC of 0.5 mg/L and was thus classified as resistant to this agent. The genetic basis for resistance was not determined, but was most likely caused by alterations in the penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2) encoded by penA. No clinical breakpoints have been established for azithromycin, but the MIC distribution does not indicate the presence of acquired macrolide resistance (Table 61).

RESULTS AND COMMENTS Neisseria gonorrhoeae was surveyed in NORM in 2003 and 2010, and then yearly since 2013 by the Reference Laboratory at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Only a single isolate from each disease episode was included from each patient. The microbiological data could not be linked to information in the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS). In 2020, a total of 442 isolates were available for analysis. The isolates were reported to originate from urethra (n=170), cervix uteri A total of 348 (78.9%) isolates originated from men and 93 (21.1%) from women. The geographical location where the infection was acquired was in most cases unknown to the laboratory. From MSIS it is reported that gonococcal infections frequently are acquired abroad with secondary transmission in sexual networks within Norway. There is an ongoing outbreak among men who have sex with men, but the strains linked to this outbreak could not be identified in the NORM protocol. The results from susceptibility testing are presented in Tables 62-63. A majority of isolates were either susceptible only to increased exposure (72.9%) or resistant (21.9%) to penicillin G. The corresponding figures for 2019 were 80.1% and 18.6%, respectively. Eighty-three isolates (18.8%) produced beta-lactamase, which is a slight increase from 2019 (15.4%). Practically all beta-lactamase positive isolates (82/83, 98.8%) were also resistant to ciprofloxacin. Nineteen isolates (4.3%) were resistant, and 318 (71.9%) were only susceptible to increased exposure to penicillin G in spite of being beta-lactamase negative. This illustrates the alternative mechanisms for penicillin resistance, such as alterations in penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) and/or reduced permeability through the outer cell membrane. All isolates were categorised as susceptible to ceftriaxone (MIC 0.125 mg/L). Ceftriaxone resistant isolates from Norway have previously been linked to treatment failure. Five isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone, but resistant to cefixime. Cefixime is no longer recommended for empirical treatment in Norway. The results confirm the emergence of cephalosporin resistant gonococci in Norway, which is extremely alarming from both a clinical and a public health perspective. The current European treatment guidelines recommend empirical combination treatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. It should be noted that 7.7% of the isolates displayed azithromycin MIC values above the EUCAST screening breakpoint for acquired resistance of 1 mg/L. The corresponding figure for 2019 was 19.4%. Ciprofloxacin was previously used for empirical treatment of gonorrhoeae acquired outside South-East Asia. The prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance persisted at a high level (54.8%) in 2020. Ciprofloxacin is consequently not a viable alternative except in cases where susceptibility has been documented. All strains were susceptible to the aminocyclitol spectinomycin.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS Nineteen methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates were detected in the NORM surveillance system in 2020, corresponding to a prevalence of 1.4% (Table 64). This is an increase from 2018 and 2019 (both 0.8%). The resistance phenotype was confirmed by mecA PCR in all cases. The isolates originated from eight different hospitals, but a single institution accounted for ten of them. Laboratory screening for MRSA in NORM is performed using cefoxitin disks and there was full concordance between cefoxitin and mecA PCR results. Some and clindamycin (S=18; I=1). The results from susceptibility testing of all Norwegian MRSA isolates are presented in Table 67 on page 113. The NORM findings are at the same level as reported from the databases of the participating laboratories where 34 out of 1,968 (1.7%) S. aureus blood culture isolates were MRSA. One of the 17 S. aureus isolates recovered from cerebrospinal fluid was methicillin resistant, thus bringing the total number of systemic MRSA isolates to 35/1,993 (1.8%). This is an increase since 2018 (0.8%) and 2019 (0.9%). Eighty-one S. aureus isolates (5.9%) were resistant to erythromycin. This is slightly higher than in previous years (5.3% in 2018; 5.4% in 2019). The macrolide resistance phenotypes of erythromycin resistant isolates were determined by the double disk diffusion (DDD) test. Seven isolates (9%) were constitutively MLS B resistant, 56 (69%) were inducibly B resistant, and 18 (22%) displayed efflux mediated M-type resistance. These figures represent 0.5%, 4.1% and 1.3% of all S. aureus isolates from blood cultures, respectively. The distribution of MLS phenotypes was essentially unchanged from 2019-2020. The prevalence of resistance to fusidic acid at 3.7% was at the same level as 3.0% in 2018 and 3.6% in 2019. The 5.1% prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance was essentially unchanged from 4.6% in 2019. The breakpoint for susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was reduced from S 1 mg/L to S 0.001 mg/L in 2020, thus the wildtype population of S. aureus is now defined as susceptible only to increased exposure to this agent. There were no significant changes for gentamicin, rifampicin, tigecycline or trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole. All isolates were fully susceptible to linezolid. The general test panel for S. aureus did not include vancomycin in 2020. Figure 84 shows the prevalence of resistance to various antimicrobials. A total of 68.6% of the isolates were beta- lactamase positive, which is at the same level as 69.8% in 2018 and 70.6% in 2019. There were only minor differences in the prevalence of resistance to non-beta- lactam antibiotics between beta-lactamase positive and negative isolates.

Eighteen out of 1,005 (1.8%) isolates were confirmed as MRSA by mecA PCR. The prevalence was at approximately the same level as in 2018 (1.7%) and 2019 (1.3%). The MRSA isolates originated from patients visiting general practitioners (n=12), hospital wards (n=4) and outpatient clinics (n=2) in different parts of the country. Most MRSA isolates were co- isolates were susceptible to tigecycline, rifampicin and linezolid. No isolates were reported with zone diameters below the cefoxitin screening breakpoint without being confirmed as MRSA by mecA PCR. This indicates high specificity of the cefoxitin screen as well as a low prevalence of mecC MRSA (see page 113). The prevalence of resistance to fusidic acid in S. aureus wound isolates decreased from 5.3% in 2019 to 4.4% in 2020 (Table 65 and Figure 85). This confirms that the gradually declining prevalence of fusidic acid resistance has now levelled off after the epidemic which peaked at 25.0% in 2004. The prevalence of resistance to fusidic acid is still slightly lower in blood culture isolates (3.7 %). For other antimicrobial agents such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, rifampicin, and tetracycline there were only minor changes from 2019-2020, and the prevalence of resistance was in general similar for blood culture isolates and isolates from wound specimens. All isolates remained phenotypically susceptible to linezolid. Fifty-two (5.2%) isolates were resistant to erythromycin, which is at the same level as 5.5% in 2018 and 5.9% in 2019. The isolates were further examined for determination of resistance phenotype and the majority were either inducibly (33/52, 63% resistant isolates) or of erythromycin resistant isolates) resistant to clindamycin, thus representing the iMLSB and cMLS B phenotypes, respectively. A minor proportion of the isolates displayed low-level resistance to erythromycin only (13/52, 25% of erythromycin resistant isolates) compatible with efflux mediated M-type resistance. The findings are overall in accordance with the results from previous years. A total of 69.8% of the isolates were beta-lactamase positive compared to 72.6% in 2018 and 75.0% in 2019. Beta-lactamase negative isolates were more likely to be resistant to erythromycin (5.9%) compared to beta- lactamase positive isolates (4.9%), whereas beta-lactamase positive isolates had a higher prevalence of resistance to tetracycline (5.3%) and ciprofloxacin (4.4%) than beta- and 3.6%, respectively). For other antimicrobials there were only minor differences. FIGURE 85. Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among Staphylococcus aureus wound isolates 2001-2020.

Additionally, 348 isolates were randomly selected for genotyping, and seven isolates were genotyped by request from referring microbiology laboratories. 255 different spa- types were identified, of which 112 spa-types were reported as single events and 114 spa-types were reported from two to ten times. Only 38 spa-types were reported more than ten times. Table 66 shows the ten most common spa-types in Norway 2020.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS As in previous years, enterococci were analysed both as a genus and separately for E. faecalis and E. faecium . The results for each species are microbiologically more valid as resistance rates differ significantly between E. faecalis and E. faecium . However, overall rates of resistance are of interest when formulating empirical treatment strategies because they include the probability of systemic infections with each enterococcal species. The overall results for enterococci are presented in Table 68. The surveillance in NORM 2020 included 482 (71.2%) E. faecalis isolates (71.6% in 2019), 144 (21.2%) E. faecium isolates (22.1% in 2019), and 51 (7.5%) unspeciated or belonging to other species (6.3% in 2019). The ratio of E. faecalis to E. faecium isolates has declined in many countries as the incidence of E. faecium bacteremia has increased. In Norway this ratio has remained stable at 3.0 in 2018, 3.2 in 2019 and 3.3 in 2020. The panel of antimicrobial agents examined was unchanged from 2019-2020. E. faecalis was universally susceptible to ampicillin (Table 69). The prevalence of resistance to ampicillin in E. faecium was 71.5% in 2020 compared to 75.3% in 2018 and 75.9% in 2019 (Table 70). As expected, the results for imipenem closely mirrored those for ampicillin. The prevalence of high-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR) in E. faecalis was 12.0%, which is a further decrease from 14.1% in 2018 and 13.6% in 2020 (Figure 88). The prevalence of HLGR in E. faecium increased from 32.4% in 2019 to 43.8% in 2020. Almost all (59/63) HLGR E. faecium isolates were concomitantly resistant to ampicillin and imipenem. Conversely, 59 of 103 (57.3%) ampicillin resistant faecium also displayed HLGR. High-level gentamicin / NORM-VET 2020 HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES 115resistance in enterococci is of great concern as it abolishes the bactericidal synergy between aminoglycosides and beta-lactams often used for treatment of severe enterococcal infections. Transferrable vancomycin resistance has not yet become endemically established in clinical enterococcal isolates in Norway, but recent outbreaks have occurred in different parts of the country. Ten blood culture isolates were reported as vancomycin resistant in NORM 2020 (1.5%), but none of them were confirmed by PCR to harbour transferrable vancomycin resistance. The phenotypically resistant isolates were either E. gallinarum (n=6) or E. casseliflavus (n=4), which are inherently low-level resistant to vancomycin due to expression of the VanC ligase. All enterococcal isolates were susceptible to linezolid. FIGURE 88. Prevalence of high-level resistance to gentamicin in blood culture isolates of Enterococcus faecalis , E. faecium and all enterococci combined The breakpoint was decreased from R 1,024 mg/L to R > 128 mg/L in 2004. Vancomycin and linezolid resistant enterococci in Norway 2020 Vancomycin resistant enterococci Enterococci are the third most common cause of hospital associated bacterial infections in Europe (1) and the fifth most common bacterial genus in blood culture isolates in Norway (2). They are intrinsically resistant to many antimicrobial agents and readily acquire resistance towards clinically important antimicrobials including vancomycin (3). Vancomycin resistance in enterococci is due to changes in the peptide sidechain that prevents vancomycin from inhibiting crosslinking in the peptidoglycan cell wall (4). Currently, nine gene clusters are known to encode vancomycin resistance (vanA, vanB, vanC, vanD, vanE, vanG, vanL, vanM and that are intrinsic to Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum. The other gene clusters are acquired by horizontal gene transfer and occur mostly in Enterococcus faecalis and/or Enterococcus faecium . The most common acquired gene clusters are vanA then vanB (5). In Norway, vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) are notifiable to the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS) with national reference functions located at the Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Detection of Antimicrobial Resistance (K-res). K-res confirms the resistance phenotype when there is a discrepancy between pheno- and genotype with the reference method (microbroth dilution) and genetic characterisation with PCR and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on selected isolates to clarify resistance mechanisms and potential genetic relatedness indicating regional/ national spread. In Europe, a worrying increase in vancomycin resistant E. faecium has been reported the last years (6), while in Norway the incidence of VRE has varied during the last ten years. In 2020, 74 VRE plus one VRE that was also linezolid resistant (LVRE) were reported in Norway (Figure 89). This represents a decrease (63%) from 2019. K-res has received isolates and/or WGS data on 33 of these 75 (44%). Thus, this is not a complete picture of the VRE situation in Norway, even though some trends are observed.

Worldwide vancomycin resistance is also much more prevalent in E. faecium than in E. faecalis (7,8), and vanA is more frequent than vanB (5). In Norway, both vanA and vanB E. faecium are to a large extent connected with smaller outbreaks/clusters in the Western and South-Eastern regions, but also occur as sporadic isolates (Figure 91).

The isolates are colour coded according to primary laboratory. Genetically closely related isolates (20 allelic distance) are highlighted in grey. SE=South-Eastern, W=Western, C=Central regions. We have registered eight different sequence types (STs) of E. faecium in 2019 and six in 2020 (Figure 92). To a large extent, the same STs are found in 2020 and 2019. Some STs observed in 2019 (ST18, ST78 and ST789) are not detected in 2020. Except ST22 (n=1) that occurs in 2020, all STs in 2020 (ST17, ST80, ST117, ST203 and ST787) belong to known pandemic hospital adapted clones. ST22 has previously been associated with both patients in hospitals and different animals (9,10). The most predominant STs in E. faecium in 2020 are linked to outbreaks/clusters such as vanB ST17 in the South-Eastern region, two different clusters of vanA ST80 in the South-Eastern and Western regions, as well as vanB ST117 and vanA ST203 in the Western region (Figure 91). For E. faecalis two different STs were registered in 2019 of which ST6 often has been linked to clinical isolates and hospitals. The single VRE E. faecalis in 2020 was of a new ST (ST1117). Conclusion The number of patients with VRE (n=75) registered in MSIS in Norway in 2020 represents a large decrease (63%) from 2019. The decline was seen in the Western and South-Eastern regions. The number of patients with VRE in Norway varies depending on the incidence of hospital outbreaks. It may be that the infection control measures introduced in hospitals due to the pandemic also have reduced the spread of hospital associated VRE infections. In this report, we present WGS-data for 33 of these isolates. The majority of VRE were E. faecium with a vanA or vanB genotype . Both vanA and vanB E. faecium are to a large extent linked to smaller outbreaks/clusters in the Western and South-Eastern regions, but also occur sporadically. The majority of VRE E. faecium belong to dispersed hospital-adapted clones identified in several other countries (ST17, ST80, ST117, ST203 and ST787). FIGURE 92.

The prevalence of linezolid resistance in enterococci is still low (<1%) worldwide (11) but is increasing in many countries (12,13). Linezolid binds to the ribosome and inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Acquired resistance to linezolid may be due to structural changes in the ribosome based on mutations in the ribosomal RNA and/or ribosomal proteins, as well as through gene products that chemically modify (methylate) the ribosome ( cfr). Another type of resistance mechanism is due to proteins (encoded by optrA and poxtA) that protect the ribosome against binding of linezolid. The cfr, optrA and poxtA genes can all be localised on mobile genetic elements (12,14,15). In Norway, linezolid resistant enterococci (LRE) are notifiable to the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS) after confirmation at the national reference laboratory for LRE, the Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Detection of Antimicrobial Resistance (K-res). K-res confirms the resistance phenotype with the reference method (microbroth dilution) and performs genetic characterisation with PCR and whole genome sequencing to find resistance mechanisms and monitor genetic relatedness between the isolates. The Norwegian working group on antibiotics and methods for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AFA) recommend routine susceptibility testing for linezolid of clinical isolates of Enterococcus in Norway. All invasive Enterococcus isolates (n=1,271) were categorised as susceptible in the NORM report from 2019. Thus, there is no reason to believe that LRE is a large problem in Norway. However, the recommendations from AFA should be followed due to the global increase in LRE. FIGURE 93. The number of linezolid resistant E. faecium and E. faecalis in Norway 2012-2020, including LRE that are vancomycin resistant. In 2020, ten cases of LRE were detected in Norway, compared to 16 in 2019 (Figure 93). WGS analyses revealed no closely related isolates (Figures 91 and 94). The predominant species has changed from E. faecium towards E. faecalis the last years. The increase in E. faecalis LRE in Norway as of 2016 (Figure 93; n=35) is mainly due to non-clonal spread of isolates with optrA (Figure 95; n=32). 024681012141618 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 E. faecalis E. faecium NORM / NORM-VET 2020 HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES 119 FIGURE 94. Minimum spanning network built from core genome allelic profiles of the nine Norwegian E. faecalis (LRE n=8, VRE n=1) 2020 isolates using Ridom-SeqSphere+ genome (cg) MLST scheme with E. faecalis OG1RF as reference strain. The isolates are colour coded according to primary laboratory. None of the isolates are closely related (> 7 allelic distance). The two ST32 isolates showed 158 allelic differences. Linezolid resistance in enterococci has traditionally mostly been mediated by point mutations in the chromosomal 23S rRNA regions, mainly the G2576U mutation. Mutations are known to occur after long-term exposure to linezolid (16). In 2020, two LRE were E. faecium of which one isolate had mutational based linezolid resistance and the other an unknown mechanism of resistance. Of the linezolid resistant E. faecalis (n=8), seven isolates had optrA and one both optrA and poxtA (Figure 95). Eight of the 2020 LRE isolates were from infections and six of these had optrA. One LRE isolate was associated with import, but information about import is lacking for seven isolates. Both E. faecium isolates belonged to ST117, a well-known pandemic hospital associated sequence type. The E. faecalis isolates ( n=8) belonged to seven different STs of which ST32 was found in two isolates (Table 72). FIGURE 95.

Species, resistance mechanism and sequence type among LRE in Norway 2020. Species Resistance mechanism ST The incidence of LRE is still low in Norway. In 2020 there were six fewer cases of LRE (n=10) compared to 2019. Since 2016 there has been a change from E. faecium with mutation-based linezolid resistance to E. faecalis with transferrable resistance mechanisms dominated by optrA. However, the numbers are still too small to exclude random effects. Phylogenetic analyses and epidemiological data do not support domestic spread of LRE in Norway. The majority of LRE isolates from 2020 were recovered from clinical samples. References: 1. European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS All systemic S. pneumoniae isolates in Norway are submitted to the National Reference Laboratory for Pneumococci at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Due to reorganisation of the laboratory, no data were available for the last nine months of 2018 and all of 2019. The Reference Laboratory has resumed normal services from 2020 onwards. The results are summarised in Tables 73-74 and Figures 96- 97. Five strains were isolated from cerebrospinal fluids and seventeen were isolated from unspecified materials. Both blood culture isolates and isolates from other sterile sites were included from patients with positive cultures from more than one specimen type. Norwegian breakpoints for pneumococci are in accordance with EUCAST, and these remained unchanged in 2020. The results for penicillin G were interpreted according to the general breakpoints for pneumococci (S 0.06, R > 2 mg/L). The isolates from cerebrospinal fluids were in addition categorised according to penicillin G breakpoints for meningitis (R > 0.064). A total of 11.1% (33/297) of S. pneumoniae isolates were only susceptible to penicillin G with increased exposure (MIC 0.125-2 mg/L), and five isolates (1.7%) were classified as resistant (MIC > 2 mg/L). These rates have increased since 2018 (I + R combined were 8.9% and 12.8% in 2018 and 2020, respectively). The five penicillin G resistant isolates (MIC 4-16 mg/L) were categorised as S (n=1) cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (MIC 1-2 mg/L for both substances). Four additional isolates categorised as I to penicillin G (MIC 2 mg/L) were only susceptible to increased exposure to cefotaxime and/or ceftriaxone. Two isolates recovered from cerebrospinal fluids had penicillin G MICs of 0.25-0.5 mg/L and were thus resistant according to the meningitis breakpoint, but they were both susceptible to 3rd generation cephalosporins (S 0.5). The oxacillin screening disk is often used to differentiate isolates susceptible to standard penicillin G doses from isolates that are resistant or require increased exposure. All the 38 penicillin G I + R isolates were resistant to oxacillin. HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES NORM / NORM-VET 2020 122Conversely, 13/259 penicillin G S isolates were oxacillin resistant. The sensitivity and specificity of the screening test was thus 100% and 95.0%, respectively. Many of the S. pneumoniae isolates categorised as I+R to penicillin G erythromycin resistance was relatively stable at 8.4% in 2020 compared to 7.8% in 2017 and 6.0% in 2018 (Figure 96). Most of these isolates (20/25) were resistant to both erythromycin and clindamycin, which is compatible with a constitutive MLS B phenotype. The remaining five isolates displayed low-level resistance to erythromycin and were susceptible to clindamycin, as seen in efflux-mediated M-type resistance. Double disk diffusion tests were not performed. The distribution of MLS phenotypes was not significantly altered from 2018. The results may suggest a continuing predominance of erm- encoded macrolide resistance as opposed to the mef- dominated peak 2002-2009 (Figure 97). The 6.1% resistance rate to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was at the same level as 5.4% in 2018. The prevalence of tetracycline resistance increased from 6.0% in 2018 to 8.1% in 2020 (Figure 96). All isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, which was earlier used for empirical treatment of meningitis in Norway. The low prevalence of high-level norfloxacin resistance (Table 74) may reflect the very limited use of levofloxacin and moxifloxacin for respiratory tract infections in Norway. FIGURE 96.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS S. pneumoniae isolates from respiratory tract specimens were last surveyed in NORM in 2018. The rates of resistance to various antimicrobials are shown in Tables 75- 76 and Figure 98. . The prevalence of resistance to penicillin G was still very low (0.3%) according to the non-meningitis breakpoint of R > 2 mg/L. A single isolate with a penicillin G MIC of 8 mg/L remained fully susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. A considerable proportion of isolates (6.9% in 2018, 8.3% in 2020) would require increased exposure for treatment with penicillin G as they had MICs in the 0.125- 2 mg/L range. These 27 isolates should be categorised as penicillin G resistant in the context of clinical meningitis, and six of them would have required increased exposure to cefotaxime and/or ceftriaxone. Almost all (27/28) isolates with penicillin G MIC > 0.06 mg/L were detected by the oxacillin screening test (sensitivity 96.4%), whereas fifteen fully penicillin susceptible isolates were classified as oxacillin resistant (specificity 95.0%). Isolates with elevated penicillin G MICs were commonly cross-resistant to other antimicrobial (17/28), erythromycin and The rate of to erythromycin was 9.8% in 2020 compared to 8.2% in 2018. Macrolide resistance was thus at the same level in respiratory tract isolates as in isolates from blood and sterile sites (8.4%). The MLS fenotype of 28/32 erythromycin resistant isolates was determined by double disk diffusion. Twelve isolates (43% of erythro- mycin resistant isolates, 4.2% of all isolates) displayed constitutive MLS B resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin, whereas (7%) were inducibly resistant to clindamycin. Low-level M-type resistance was detected in 14 isolates (50% of erythromycin resistant isolates, 4.9% of all isolates). Tetracycline resistance increased from 6.9% in 2018 to 10.4% in 2020, whereas trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance increased from 8.2% in 2018 to 9.8% in 2020. The norfloxacin MIC distribution did not change significantly in the period 2018-2020. NORM / NORM-VET 2020 HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES 124 FIGURE 98.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS The Reference Laboratory at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health provides resistance data for systemic S. pyogenes isolates on a yearly basis, but very limited data were available for 2018-2019 as the laboratory was reorganised during that period. As expected, all isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin G (Tables 77-78). There were no isolates resistant to erythromycin or clindamycin in 2018, but the rates for 2020 (6.7% and 5.2%) have increased since 2017 (4.2% and 2.5%, respectively). However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to small numbers. Most erythromycin resistant isolates (7/9) were concomitantly high-level resistant to clindamycin, thus indicating the presence of constitutive MLS B resistance. The prevalence of tetracycline resistance increased from 10.9% in 2017 to 15.7% in 2020, whereas the prevalence of resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remained stable at 0.7% in 2020 compared to 0.8% in 2017. 024681012 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020% of isolatesTetracycline Penicillin G TMS* Erythromycin Cefotaxime NORM-VET 2020 HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES 125Streptococcus agalactiae in blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluids TABLE 79.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS All systemic isolates of Streptococcus agalactiae (beta- haemolytic group B streptococci) in Norway are referred to the National Reference Laboratory at St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, where confirmatory identification and susceptibility testing is performed. Since 2014, the Reference Laboratory has provided resistance data for invasive S. agalactiae isolates to NORM on a yearly basis. Relevant breakpoints have remained unchanged since 2009. A total of 303 isolates were retrieved from invasive infections (bacteremia and cerebrospinal infections) in 2020. Thirty-five isolates originated from neonates and small children < 1 year of age. Most isolates (99.3%) were recovered from blood cultures, but there were also two isolates from cerebrospinal fluids. As seen in Tables 79-80 there were no isolates with reduced susceptibility to penicillin G or vancomycin. Fifty-nine isolates (19.5%) were resistant to erythromycin compared to 22.6% in 2018 and 25.5% in 2019. They were all analysed by double disk diffusion for MLS B resistance phenotype. Constitutive MLS B resistance was found in 45 isolates (76%), while inducible MLS B resistance was detected in six isolates (10%). The remaining eight isolates (14%) had results in accordance with the efflux-mediated M phenotype encoded by mef genes. A single isolate was recorded as clindamycin resistant (MIC 2 mg/L) in spite of being susceptible to erythromycin (MIC 0.125 mg/L). This phenotype may reflect mutations in ribosomal proteins. There are no clinical breakpoints for aminoglycosides in S. agalactiae , but combination therapy with a beta-lactam is often used in clinical practice for treatment of sepsis of unknown origin. High-level resistance to gentamicin (MIC 128 mg/L) was detected in 3.6% of the isolates. The prevalence of resistance to tetracycline (75.2%) was at the same level as in 2019 (77.7%) with the majority of isolates displaying MIC values of 8-32 mg/L (Table 80). HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES NORM / NORM-VET 2020 126 Resistance against empiric antibiotic combinations in the treatment of bloodstream infections - 2020 update Narrow-spectrum antibiotic combinations are frequently used in Norway for empirical treatment of bloodstream infections (BSIs), often preferred over mono-therapy with broad-spectrum drugs [1]. In 2016, combinations of beta-lactam and gentamicin were shown to provide good coverage against many common BSI pathogens in Norway [2], thus it is of interest to see if this still is true. Table 81 shows the frequency of resistance among key pathogens in bloodstram infections (BSI) against common drugs and drug combinations used in Norwegian hospitals in the empirical treatment of sepsis in 2020 [1]. Among Gram-positive microbes, rates of resistance remain low. Notably, in Staphylococcus aureus , the prevalence of MRSA remains around 1% and gentamicin resistance is still less than 1%. Benzylpenicillin (penicillin G) resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae is only 1.7%, but the rate of isolates only susceptible to increased exposure of this agent are increasing (11.1% in 2020). Whilst susceptible to high-dose benzylpenicillin, these isolates are resistant to phenoxymethylpenicillin, frequently used as peroral step-down therapy. ESBL rates in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. continue to rise, both rates now above 6.5 % for the last three years. Worryingly, this is largely driven by multi-drug resistant clones frequently resistant to gentamicin [3-5]. For now, cefotaxime and gentamicin still provide acceptable coverage, where half of all ESBL isolates are susceptible to gentamicin. Piperacillin/tazobactam resistance rates are higher than in 2016 due to adjustment of the breakpoint in 2020 [6]. When applying the new breakpoint to 2016 data, the resistance rates are similar to 2020. For Haemophilus influenzae there are no breakpoints for benzylpenicillin, but wildtype isolates are likely susceptible to high dosage. By using benzylpencillin 1-unit screening [7], 46.5% of isolates are characterised as non-wildtype, likely rendering them resistant to benzylpenicillin. Thus, benzylpenicillin/gentamicin should be used with caution in clinical settings with a high prevalence of H. influenzae . TABLE 81.

There are a number of methodological challenges with surveillance of anaerobes. In order to ensure clinical relevance of the material, only blood culture isolates were included. Furthermore, only laboratories using MALDI-TOF and/or 16S rDNA sequencing for identification submitted data, as inconsistent speciation is a major obstacle for meaningful interpretation of data. Finally, the reproducibility of antibiotic susceptibility test results may be a problem due to subtle variations in agar composition and incubation conditions. The EUCAST/NordicAST clinical breakpoints for anaerobes have remained unchanged since 2014 for the agents included in the survey. The data for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are presented in Tables 82-83 and 84-85, respectively. The SIR distributions are combined for all genera/species in the two groups, except for Cutibacterium (formerly Propioni- bacterium spp.) which is excluded from Table 84. The MIC distribution data in Tables 83 and 85 are only presented for selected genera/species as specified. A total of 516 Gram-negative isolates were included in the survey. The majority belonged to the Bacteroides fragilis group (n=326), defined as either B. fragilis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron or B. vulgatus. All other (n=50) and \"others\" of unspecified isolates. Beta-lactamase testing was not included in the protocol, but as seen in Tables 82-83 the vast majority of Gram-negative isolates were clearly resistant to penicillin G including practically all Bacteroides spp. strains. The rate of Gram- negative isolates susceptible to standard dosage of piperacillin-tazobactam (82.5%) was at the same level as in 2014 (76.2%). As seen in Table 83, the B. fragilis group appeared more sensitive to this combination drug than other members of the same genus. Clindamycin resistance was detected in 15.9% of Gram-negative anaerobes in 2020 compared to 18.1% in 2014. Fusobacterium spp. isolates were generally suscpeptible to all the examined agents. Twelve isolates (2.3%) were resistant to meropenem (MIC 32 mg/L), ten belonging to the B. fragilis group and two identified as Desulfovibrio spp. Five additional B. fragilis group isolates were only susceptible to meropenem at increased dosage (MIC 8 mg/L). Ten metronidazole (MIC 8-256 mg/L). Among the 390 Gram-positive isolates included in the survey, about 50% belonged to the genera Clostridium (n=169) and Cutibacterium (formerly Propionibacterium ) (n=25). The latter is not generally considered a true anaerobe and the isolates are therefore omitted from Table 84. The remaning 196 isolates represented a wide spp. isolates were highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible to all other agents (Table 85). Forty-five other isolates (12.3%) of various species similarly displayed metronidazole resistance. A single Lactobacillus rhamnosus isolate was resistant to meropenem (MIC 32 mg/L), whereas three Bifido- bacterium breve isolates were only susceptible to increased dosage of this agent (MIC 4-8 mg/L). Piperacillin- tazobactam generally had high activity among all anaerobic Gram-positive species (88.8% S), whereas many species had a high prevalence of inherent or acquired resistance to penicillin G (17.8%). Clindamycin resistance (11.2%) was lower than in 2014 (17.5%). NORM / NORM-VET 2020 HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES 129Mycobacterium tuberculosis In 2020 (2019 in parenthesis), 160 (162) persons were reported with tuberculosis disease (TB) to the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS). Of these, 30 (17) were born in Norway. 130 (128) had TB for the first time, of which one (4) had received preventive treatment. 16 (11) had had previous TB, of which 15 (10) had been treated with anti-TB drugs previously. The rest, 14 (23) cases, were categorised as uncertain if they had received TB treatment previously. 132 (135) cases were confirmed with M. tuberculosis- complex (MTBC) by culture. One of these was identified as M. africanum, the rest were M. tuberculosis . Resistance results reported to MSIS are shown in Table 86. Results from testing of both isolates and direct samples are included. There was one MDR- and one RR-TB case in 2020 (two MDR-TB cases in 2019). The MDR case had low-level resistance to ethambutol, linezolide, clofazimine, bedaquiline and cycloserine. The RR case was only resistant to rifampicin and susceptible to all other drugs mentioned above. Both cases had TB for the first time, but the RR-TB patient had received preventive TB treatment previously. In addition to the MDR case, 14 cases had strains resistant to isoniazid, six of them only with low- level resistance. Seven patients with negative culture result or without culture result had results from molecular/ genotypic tests showing MTBC and sensitivity to rifampicin (no rpoB mutation). One patient without culture confirmation showed resistance to isoniazid. TABLE 86. Antimicrobial resistance for MTBC reported to MSIS (not M. bovis BCG) from human infections in 2020.

Resistance in human scabies mites and head lice A variety of pesticides have been used successfully to treat infestations of arthropod pests both on humans and animals. However, as is the case with antibiotics, frequent use of these drugs has led to treatment failure and development of resistance in many important medical and veterinary parasites. In fact, drug resistance has now been observed in more than 600 species of arthropod pests (1). Resistance to multiple drugs is observed in many species, making them very difficult to treat. Resistance to pesticides (ectoparasiticides) is the selection of a specific heritable trait (or traits) in an ectoparasite population as a result of exposure of that population to an active substance, resulting in a significant increase in the percentage of the population that will fail to respond to a standard dose of that chemical when used as recommended (2). Ectoparasitic infestations with scabies mites ) are common in humans. These infestations are rarely serious or fatal, but they do have debilitating symptoms and often come with a social stigma attached. Furthermore, the economic costs of repeated treatments can be excessive for many people. There are estimated to be more than 300 million cases of scabies worldwide each year (3). In Norway, the number of cases of scabies has increased between 2012 and 2019 (4) (Figure 99). Surprisingly, unpublished data reveal a further increase in scabies cases in 2020 during the pandemic. The prevalence of head lice has been thoroughly examined in Norway, and among elementary school students the prevalence was as low as 1.6%. However, more than one-third of the households had previously experienced pediculosis, demonstrating that many people are affected by head lice infestations over time (5). Scabies treatment in Norway includes either topical drugs (permethrin or benzylbenzoat) or in more complicated cases an oral drug (ivermectin). There are some reports of treatment failure, and possible explanations include: 1. Poor compliance - incorrect use of the drugs 2. Reinfestation due to incomplete management of surroundings, such as contact persons and items (clothing, bedding, towels etc.), although the latter is believed to be of only minor importance 3. Insensitivity/resistance of scabies mites to the drugs 4. Incorrect diagnosis HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES NORM / NORM-VET 2020 130 In vitro trials performed before 1994 with 5% permethrin cream indicated that human scabies mites died within an hour. More recent studies indicate increased tolerance to the drug with 25% survival of the mites after 12 hours (6). There are, however, no scientific papers confirming clinical resistance against permethrin among human scabies mites (7), but a confirmed case of resistant scabies mites on dogs is reported (8). Clinical resistance of human scabies mites against ivermectin is reported (9, 10). Studies have identified four different mechanisms that might contribute to scabicide resistance (11): voltage-gated sodium channels, glutathione S-transferase (GST), ATP-binding cassette transporters, and ligand-gated chloride channels. In clinical practice, patients are often seen with persisting head lice infestation despite repeated and prolonged treatments. Thus, pediculicide resistance has been an increasing concern for effective control of this ectoparasite. As for scabies, treatment failure of head lice infestations can often be explained by poor compliance and/or reinfestation, but resistance to the pediculicide used are also a probable reason. The current preferred treatment of pediculosis is dimeticone containing products, which are shown to be very effective (12, 13). Dimeticone is a physically acting pesticide that covers the body surface and respiratory system of head lice, and the development of resistance against products with this active ingredient is unlikely (14). However, resistance against drugs with chemically acting compounds, like permethrin, is frequently reported in head lice, and such drugs are therefore considered less effective (12, 15, 16). Frequent combing with a lice comb is a time-consuming treatment method, but it can nevertheless be effective if performed properly (17). FIGURE 99.

RESULTS AND COMMENTS In 2020 the National Mycology Reference Laboratory received 195 isolates from unique candidemias, compared to 199 isolates in 2019. Four infections in four patients were infections with the same species more than four weeks apart and six infections were mixed infections with more than one Candida spp. One patient had four different species in blood cultures over a two months period ( Candida albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. We received nine different Candida species from 184 patients with bloodstream infections. The species distribution is still favourable and acquired resistance in Candida spp. is rare. Candida albicans is the most common species (n=129, 66.1%) compared to 58.3% last year and 65.7 % in 2018. The number of Candida glabrata isolates is lower (n=24, 12.3 %) than in 2019 (n=29). Interestingly the number of C. parapsilosis declined from 19 to six, and no sibling species (C. metapsilosis and C. orthopsilosis ) were referred this year. C. tropicalis is, as in 2019, the third most prevalent species (n=15). Candida dubliniensis increased further from 5.5% to 7.1% (n=14), but the number of non-albicans isolates is still low. All isolates were susceptibility tested for amphotericin B, fluconazole, voriconazole, caspofungin, anidulafungin and to the manufacturer's instructions (AB bioM\u00e9rieux). Unexpected susceptibility patterns were confirmed by EUCAST standardised broth microdilution method and fks sequencing at Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen. The results are presented in Tables 87-96. Species identification still predicts the susceptibility pattern of Candida spp. in patients without long-term antifungal treatment. To implement the new definition of the \"I\" category from \"Intermediate\" to \"Susceptible, Increased exposure\" and \"Area of Technical Uncertainty\" (ATU) for the antifungal agents, the EUCAST-AFST (Subcommittee on Antifungal Susceptibility Testing) has reviewed all, and revised some, clinical antifungal breakpoints. From 2020 C. albicans with micafungin MIC 0.03 mg/L and anidulafungin MIC 0.016 mg/L is regarded sensitive and EUCAST-AFST recommend reporting such isolates as \"sensitive\" with the following comment: \"Isolates susceptible to anidulafungin with micafungin MIC of 0.03 mg/L do not harbour an fks mutation conferring resistance to the echinocandins\". The changes were released in a revised breakpoint table v. 10.0 in February 2020 and are adopted in this report. All tested isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, but amphotericin B is not recommended treatment of C. lusitaniae (n=2) infections as C. lusitaniae has high MICs or develop resistance during treatment. Two C. albicans isolates were echinocandin resistant, one micafungin resistant isolate with fks mutations R647G, and one micafungin- and anidulafungin resistant isolate with fks F641S. Two C. albicans with micafungin MIC 0.032 mg/L were both regarded sensitive according to the evaluation of ATU as they were anidulafungin sensitive. All C. parapsilosis (n=6) belonged to the wild-type, now regarded as echinocandin sensitive. The new definition of the \"I\" category from \"Intermediate\" to \"Susceptible, Increased exposure\" is not applicable for the echinocandins and C. parapsilosis as there is no dose escalation option for the echinocandins. Breakpoints for micafungin and anidulafungin against C. parapsilosis have been changed given that the clinical response is not statistically different from that for other agents despite the intrinsic target gene alteration. The two azole resistant C. parapsilosis isolates were from one patient on previous long-term treatment, two months apart. HUMAN CLINICAL ISOLATES NORM / NORM-VET 2020 134Acquired fluconazole resistance was otherwise only observed in one C. glabrata isolate (MIC 256 mg/L). The C. glabrata wild-type is considered within the \"I\" category. Fluconazole breakpoints in C. glabrata are redefined (\"I \" < 16 mg/L) to acknowledge the use of fluconazole in a high dose in some clinical situations and the susceptible category ( 0.001 mg/L) is set to avoid misclassification of \"I\" strains as \"S\" strains. C. krusei (n=1) is inherently resistant to fluconazole. There are no breakpoints for C. guillermondii (n=3) but all isolates in 2020 displayed high fluconazole MIC values (8-16 mg/L). C. dubliniensis (n=14) is closely Breakpoints were established for itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole in 2018 and from 2020 breakpoints of amphotericin B and fluconazole against C. albicans are adopted for C. dubliniensis . The MIC distribution is now shown in Table 96. The wild-type populations of C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis are considered susceptible to voriconazole and all isolates with defined breakpoints, with the exception of the two fluconazole resistant C. parapsilosis isolates, were found susceptible to voriconazole in 2020. The intermediate category for voriconazole was introduced for C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis in 2018 to acknowledge that increased exposure can be obtained by intravenous dosing. There is insufficient evidence that C. glabrata and C. krusei are good targets for therapy with voriconazole and no breakpoints have been set. Breakpoints for isavuconazole have not been established. Decreased susceptibility to different antifungal classes is common in some of the species not shown in the tables; C. guillermondii (n=3) NORM-VET 2020 APPENDICES 135Appendix 1: Collection of data on usage of antimicrobial agents in animals Data sources Sales data at wholsalers level In Norway, all medicinal products for animals are prescription-only medicines - this includes both veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) and human medicinal products (HMPs). The latter can be prescribed according to the so- called cascade (Directive 2001/82/EC, Article 10) - i.e. if there is no VMP authorised for the condition, HMP is allowed to be used. For food-producing species it requires that a maximum residue level (MRL) has been assigned for the active substance in question or that it is shown that MRL is not nessecary. Both VMPs and HMP have to be dispensed through pharmacies that are supplied by wholesalers. Medicated feed (manufactured from premix VMPs) is supplied to the end user by feed mills and is currently only used for farmed fish; this is due to the small size of livestock herds in Norway and the low use of group/flock treatments. Group treatment of livestock (terrestrial animals) with anti- bacterial agents is administered through drinking water or as top-dressing on the feed. Wholesalers and feed mills in Norway are mandated to provide sales statistics for veterinary medicinal products, including when supplied as medicated feed, to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH). Data on sales of each product presentation (name, form, strength and pack size) of the included VMPs were obtained from the NIPH. One exception; antibacterials for farmed fish for the years 2013-2020 were obtained from the Veterinary Prescription Register (VetReg). Veterinarians in Norway are not allowed to dispense VMPs, except for treatments until a pharmacy can provide the VMPs. In such cases the medicinal products have to be sold at cost price. Prescription data The Norwegian Food Safety Authority established the Veterinary Prescription Register (VetReg) for farmed fish 1 January 2011 and for terrestrial animals 1 January 2012. The veterinarians are mandated to report any administration and deliveries of VMPs and HMPs to VetReg for all terrestrial food-producing animals and horses while it is voluntary for all other animal species such as companion animals. Pharmacies and feed mills have to report all deliveries, i.e. for all terrestrial animals and farmed fish, to veterinarians or animal owners, including medicines prescribed for companion animals and HMPs. For farmed fish the reporting of prescription of antibacterials has been shown to be complete for the years 2013-2018 (1) and this was the case also for 2019 and 2020 data data; VetReg data are used for farmed fish for these years. For 2012-2014 data from VetReg on antibacterials for terrestrial food-producing animals, the quality of the prescription data was unsatisfactory (unpublished data). For oral paste and intramammaries data quality was unsatisfactory for the entire period 2012-2020, with the result that amounts used could not be calculated. The number of prescriptions was used to obtain a picture of the prescribing per species for these formulations. In this analysis only 2015-2020 data for injectables, oral powders and oral solution from VetReg have been used (2); these were calculated to express kg antibacterials prescribed/used and the outputs were compared to sales data for the corresponding forms obtained from NIPH for the years 2015-2020: The results show that the VetReg data cover around two third of the sales data for VMP injectables , oral powders and oral solution. It could not be identified whether the data are represenative for the prescribing of VMPs by animal species, but the VetReg data are nevertheless believed to give a rough picture of the prescription of antibacterial classes by formulation and animal species. VetReg data have therefore been used as an additional souce in order to assess changes according to targets set in the National Strategy against Antibiotic Resistance (2015-2020) (3). Antibacterial included in the data set The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical vet (ATCvet) classification system was used to identify the VMPs to be included in the data. Sales of VMPs belonging to the ATCvet codes shown in the table below were collected from the NIPH for terrestrial animals, for farmed fish data for QJ01 were collected from VetReg. This is identical to the inclusion criteria by the European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption (ESVAC) (4). For the estimation of prescription of HMP antibacterials belonging to the ATC codes, J01 and J04AB are included (extracted from VetReg data). Antibacterial veterinary medicinal products included in the data Categories ATCvet codes Intestinal use QA07AA;QA07AB Intrauterine Only sulfonamides Antibacterial veterinary medicinal products sold on special exemption from market authorisation are included in the sales data and prescription data. Dermatological preparations (QD) and preparations for sensory organs (QS) are not included in the data which is in accordance with the ESVAC protocol (4). APPENDICES NORM / NORM-VET 2020 136 Data source animal population data - Denominator A population correction unit (PCU) has been established as a denominator for the reporting of ESVAC sales data. In this report, PCU has been used as denominator for sales of antibacterial VMPs. It is emphasised that the PCU is purely a surrogate for the animal population at risk. The animal categories included in the PCU as well as the calculation methodology are identical to ESVAC and are detailed in the ESVAC 2016 report (3). The PCU for each terrestrial animal category is calculated by multiplying numbers of livestock animals (dairy cows, sheep, sows and horses) and slaughtered animals (cattle, goats, pigs, sheep, poultry, rabbits and turkeys) by the theoretical weight at the most likely time for treatment. The PCU is calculated for each species, weight class and/or production type, as follows: Number of animals slaughtered \u00d7 estimated weight at treatment Number of livestock \u00d7 estimated weight at treatment The total PCU is calculated according to the above data. 1 PCU = 1 kg of animal biomass. For farmed fish, fish biomass live-weight slaughtered is used as PCU in ESVAC reports. Data on animal population, including farmed fish, used to calculate PCU were obtained from Statistics Norway (https://www.ssb.no). Indicators The National Strategy against Antibiotic Resistance (2015- 2020) (3) does not specify which indicators to be used in order to measure progress in terms of reduction of usage of antibacterials in animals. In 2017, ECDC, EFSA and EMA jointly established a list of harmonised outcome indicators to measure progress in reducing the usage of antimicrobials and antimicrobial resistance both in humans and food- producing animals. In order to measure the overall effect of policy interventions/management measures to reduce the consumption for food-producing animals the proposed indicator is overall sales in mg/PCU (mg active substance/population correction unit) (5). Therefore, the indicators used to report the usage of antibacterials in the current report are kg active substance and for food- producing animals also mg/PCU. Analysis of the overall sales data The sales data for each VMP presentation were calculated to express weight of active substance. In order to comply with the ESVAC standards, sales of prodrugs - e.g. procaine benzylpenicillin and penethamate hydriodide - have been converted to the corresponding values for the active ingredient, here benzylpenicillin (4). The sales data of antibacterial VMPs for terrestrial animals have been split into sales for food-producing animals (including horses) and companion animals. Sales of antibacterial VMPs for companion animals refer to sales of tablets, oral solution and oral paste that are approved solely for companion animals; in addition, dihydrostreptomycin tablets of pack size 10 pieces have been included in the data on sales for companion animals (no sales after 2004). The other antibacterial VMPs are assumed sold for use only in food-producing animals (including horses). There is some use of injectable VMPs in companion animals, thus the usage for this animal category is slightly underestimated and therefore slightly overestimated for food-producing animals. Sales of VMPs for food-producing animals have been further stratified into VMPs for treatment of individual food-producing animals - bolus, oral paste injectables, intramammary preparations, intrauterine preparations and some tablets (dihydrostreptomycin pack size 20 and 100) and for group treatment (oral solution and oral powder). Estimation of sales for cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and poultry The national strategy does not specify for which food- producing terrestrial animals the reduction should cover. Because cattle, pigs, sheep, and poultry accounted for approximately 99% of the Norwegian meat production in 2020 (https://www.ssb.no/slakt ), these species as well as goats were selected to evaluate the goals set down in the national strategy (3). The sales data for 2013-2020 have been further refined in order to obtain estimates on the usage in cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and poultry that are more accurate in terms of identifying changes over time. Of the total annual sales of antibacterial VMPs for terrestrial food-producing animals, oral paste approved for horses accounted for 21% in 2013. That figure increased to 26% in 2020, see figure below. Data on prescribtions per animal species obtained from the Veterinary Prescription Register (VetReg) have been used as supportive information to the sales data for this refinement. VetReg data show that for the years 2015-2020, on average 97% (range 96.4%-97.3%) of the number of prescriptions of antibacterial oral paste VMPs was for horses showing that off-lable use for other animal species of oral paste was negligible. Oral paste (numerator) and PCU for horses (denominator) has been excluded from the analysis of data for the estimation of usage of antibacterial VMPs for cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and poultry. Intramammaries have been excluded from the analysis of the VetReg data regarding prescribed amounts (kg) due to data quality issues (2). NORM / NORM-VET 2020 APPENDICES 137 Proportion of kg sold in Norway of antibacterial veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) approved for one or more of the food- producing animal species, including horses, by pharmaceutical forms in the period 2013-2020. Of note, there were no sales of antibacterial VMP intrauterine devices in 2020. The usage of HMPs for cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and poultry was estimated by use of the following data from VetReg: Delivery to animal owners from pharmacies of antibacterial HMPs for use in these species, plus Veterinarians' use/delivery of antibacterial HMP for these species. Note that due to underreporting by veterinarians the data represents an underestimate. Estimation of sales of HMPs for dogs and cats Veterinarians reported almost no use of HMPs for companion animals to VetReg; this is due to the fact that veterinarians are not mandated to report use of medicines for companion animals to VetReg. It should be noted that the sales from pharmacies to veterinarians of antibacterial HMPs applicable for use in dogs and cats were negligible. The amounts, in kg active substance, of usage of antibacterial HMPs for companion animals were estimated by use of the following data from VetReg: Delivery from pharmacies to animal owners of antibacterial HMPs for use in dogs and cats Delivery from pharmacies to veterinarians of antibacterial HMP tablets and of oral solution and oral powder for solution suitable for companion animals.

These data are collected from three databases: the Norwegian Drug Wholesales Statistics Database, the Hospital Pharmacies Drug Statistics Database and the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD). The Norwegian Institute of Public Health collects data on drug use from wholesalers. The wholesales database covers total sales of antimicrobials in Norway and is based on sales of medicaments from drug wholesalers to pharmacies and health institutions in Norway. The figures presented should be regarded as maximum figures based on the assumption that all medicaments sold are actually consumed. The actual drug consumption will probably be somewhat lower. Data are available since the beginning of the seventies. Data on antibacterial use in hospitals are retrieved from SLS - Sykehusapotekenes Legemiddelstatistikk (Hospital Pharmacies Drug Statistics Database) which is a cooperation of LIS - Legemiddelinnkj\u00f8pssamarbeid (Drug Purchasing Cooperation) and the four regional pharmaceutical health trusts operating the hospital pharmacies in Norway. SLS collects sales data from each pharmacy delivering drugs to hospitals. Data are collected as sales from the pharmacy to hospital wards. Data have been available since 2006. Nasjonal kompetansetjeneste for antibiotikabruk i spesialisthelsetjenesten ( Norwegian Advisory Unit for Antibiotic Use in Hospitals) has analysed the data according to activity (admission and bed days). Population statistics per 1 January are collected from Statistics Norway. Information on bed days and admissions are collected from the Norwegian Patient Register at the Norwegian Directorate of Health. The definition of bed days is: \" the number of whole days an admitted patient disposes a bed \". An admission is defined as: \" admission of patient where the medical interventions usually are complex and requires hospitalisation for one or more days \" (2). Data on the use in ambulatory care are retrieved from NorPD, a nation-wide prescription database situated at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. This database includes all prescriptions being prescribed to outpatients in Norway. For analyses on prescriptions and DDDs, all prescriptions and DDDs to outpatients are included. For the results on annual prevalence (number of individuals per population group being prescribed antibiotics within a year), only prescriptions to individuals with national ID numbers are included. The data give us the exact population prevalence of antibacterial use in the total population in ambulatory care. More information is available at www.fhi.no. Data are available from 2004. Drug Classification The data are categorised according to the ATC classification system (1). Defined Daily Doses (DDDs) are employed as units of measurement. The ATC/DDD index of 2021 is used for all years. Unit of measurement The ATC/DDD system is recommended by the WHO to serve as a tool for drug utilisation research in order to improve quality of drug use. One component of this is the presentation and comparison of drug consumption statistics at international and other levels. The use of defined daily dose - DDD - as a unit of measurement, simplifies and improves the evaluation of drug consumption over time, nationally and internationally. The DDD is a theoretical unit of measurement, and does not necessarily reflect the recommended or Prescribed Daily Dose. The basic definition of the unit is: The DDD is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults. The DDDs for the antibacterials are as a main rule based on the use in infections of moderate severity. Some antibacterials are only used in severe infections and their DDDs are assigned accordingly. The DDDs assigned are based on daily treatment. Inclusion criteria The antibacterials for human use included in this report belong to ATC group J01 \"antibacterials for systemic use\". Oral vancomycin (A07AA09), fidaxomycin (A07AA12) and oral and rectal metronidazole (P01AB01) are also included in some figures. Antibacterials used in dermatological preparations (ATC group D) and preparations intended for sensory organs (ATC group S) are not included in the material, except for mupirocin, which is included in one table.

Altogether, 74 K. pneumoniae isolates were included for susceptibility testing . In total, 83 Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) isolates from pigs were collected from both clinical submissions (including autopsies) submitted to t he NVI and from a research project. All isolates were collected between 2004-2020. The rest of the samples included in 2020 were collected by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA). Caecal samples of broiler and turkey flocks were collected at slaughter for isolation of the indicator bacteria Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (as well as zoonotic bacteria, see Appendix 4). From each poultry flock ten caecal samples were collected. A total of 247 pooled samples from broiler and 121 pooled samples from turkeys were included, only one sample per flock. In addition, 323 broiler meat samples were collected at retail in all regions of Norway following the specifications set by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA journal 2014; 12(5):3686). Samples were to be taken without taking place of origin into consideration. All the caecal and meat samples were also used for selective isolation of E. coli resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) and carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). In addition, selective isolation for vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE) was performed on the caecal samples. Isolation and identification of bacteria Clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae and APP The strains were cultured from frozen stocks stored at -80\u00b0C. K. pneumoniae was cultured on blood agar (Blood Agar Base No.2 (Oxoid, Oslo, Norway)) with 5% bovine blood and APP on blood agar in the presence of a Staphylococcus aureus isolate. After incubation of the agar plates at 37\u00b11\u00b0C for 18-24 hrs, the strains were confirmed as K. pneumoniae or APP by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). Indicator isolates of E. coli Sample material, i.e. caecal content from ten broilers or turkeys per flock were pooled and plated directly onto MacConkey agar (Difco) and incubated at 44\u00b10.5\u00b0C for on blood agar and incubated at 37\u00b11\u00b0C for 20\u00b12h. Colonies were identified as E. coli by typical colony appearance and a positive indole reaction before further phenotypical testing. Indicator isolates of E. faecalis and E. faecium Sample material, i.e. caecal content from ten broilers or turkeys per flock were pooled and plated directly onto Slanetz and Bartley agar (Oxoid) and incubated at on blood agar incubated at 37\u00b11\u00b0C for 20\u00b12h. Colonies were identified as E. faecalis or E. faecium using MALDI-TOF MS. Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. Sample material, i.e. caecal content from ten broilers or turkeys per flock were pooled and plated directly onto Slanetz and Bartley agar containing 4 mg/L vancomycin (Oxoid) on Slanetz and Bartley agar containing 4 mg/L vancomycin and blood agar containing bovine blood and incubated at 37\u00b11\u00b0C for 20\u00b12h. Presumptive colonies were identified as E. faecalis or E. faecium by typical colony appearance and verified using MALDI-TOF MS before further phenotypical testing. Enrichment of caecal and broiler meat samples All samples were enriched prior to plating onto selective media. A total of 1\u00b10.1 g caecal sample material from broiler or turkey was homogenised with 9 mL of buffered peptone water which is compliant to the ISO 6579 formulation (BPW-ISO). A total of 25 g broiler meat was homogenised with 225 mL of BPW-ISO. Samples were incubated at 37\u00b11\u00b0C for 20\u00b12 h according to the protocol from the EURL-AR (http://www.eurl-ar.eu/233-protocols. htm). From the overnight enrichment broth, 10-20 L were plated on selective media as described in the sections below. E. coli resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) Aliquots from the overnight BPW-ISO broth from all caecal and meat samples were plated onto MacConkey agar containing mg/L at 44\u00b10.5\u00b0C for ESC resistant E. subcultured MacConkey agar containing 1 mg/L cefotaxime and blood agar, and confirmed as E. coli using MALDI-TOF MS before further tested for cephalosporinase production. Carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Aliquots from the overnight BPW-ISO broth from all caecal and meat samples were Presumptive CRE were subcultured on respective selective CHROMID\u00ae agar and blood agar, and species were confirmed using MALDI-TOF MS before further phenotypical testing. Genotyping DNA was extracted using QIAamp\u00ae DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) performed at the NVI on an Illumina\u00ae MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA). The WGS data were quality controlled by adapter and quality trimming using Trimmomatic (Bolger et al. 2014), and assembled using SPAdes v3.11.0 (Bankevich et al. 2012) using the \"-- careful\" parameter and a contigs cut-off of \"500\". For the quality checking and assembly procedure, the Bifrost pipeline developed at the NVI was applied (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4043861). Assemblies or APPENDICES NORM / NORM-VET 2020 140paired end reads were subjected to analysis using ResFinder V.4.1 for both aquired genes and chromosomal point mutations (PointFinder) using the online tool at the Centre for Genomic Epidemiology web site (https://cge.cbs. dtu. dk/services/ResFinder/). Susceptibility testing Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using a broth microdilution method at NVI. MIC values were obtained using plates from Sensititre\u00ae (TREK Diagnostic LTD) with different panels depending on the tested bacteria. Narasin MIC values for Enterococcus spp. were obtained using custom made plates from VetMIC veterin\u00e4rmedicinska anstalt, Sweden). The Sensititre\u00ae TREK panels BOPO6F (VFM medium) and EUVSEC were used for the clinical APP and K. pneumoniae isolates, respectively. Epidemiological cut-off (ECOFF) values recommended by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST, accessed 20.03.2021) were used, though with some exceptions as described in Appendix 6 and Appendix 7. Overview of the antimicrobial classes and agents tested for with corresponding ECOFFs are shown in Appendix 7. Quality assurance systems The following susceptible bacteria were included as quality control on a regular basis: E. coli ATCC 25922 and E. faecalis ATCC 25922. In addition to the regular susceptible bacteria, the following bacteria received from EURL-AR were included: Acinetobacter E. faecalis bacterial strain E. faecium CCUG 36804 was tested on a regular basis. The results were approved according to reference values given by EUCAST when available. Additional control strains were included when necessary. The laboratories at NVI are accredited according to the requirements of NS-EN ISO/IEC 17025, and participate in quality assurance programmes for veterinary pathogens (Veterinary Laboratories Agency Quality Assurance Unit. Loughborough, UK) and for resistance monitoring (EURL for Antimicrobial Resistance in Denmark), respectively. Data processing Susceptibility data were recorded and stored in the sample registration system at the NVI as discrete values (MIC). Data management was performed both in SAS-PC System\u00ae v 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc. Cary. NC. USA) and in R version 4.0.3 Copyright (C) 2020 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Platform), while the statistical analysis was performed in R. Mainly Chi-square tests (when applicable) were performed for comparing resistance levels between years or groups and p-values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. The 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the exact binomial test. NORM / NORM-VET 2020 APPENDICES 141Appendix 4: Sampling, microbiological methods and data processing of zoonotic and non-zoonotic enteropathogenic bacteria in NORM and NORM-VET NORM-VET enteropathogenic bacteria Sampling strategy - animals and food Salmonella Samples from animals were collected according to the Norwegian Salmonella control programme for live animals. Additional isolates were obtained from clinical submissions or necropsies at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute (NVI). One isolate of each serovar per incident was included for susceptibility testing. Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni Caecal samples were collected by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority at slaughter. For turkey, these samples are those described in Appendix 3. For broilers, ten caecal samples were collected from flocks identified as Campylobacter positive in the surveillance programme for Campylobacter spp. in broiler flocks, as well as flocks with unknown Campylobacter status. Caecal contents from ten samples per flock were plated directly onto mCCDA agar (Oxoid) and incubated under microaerobic conditions at Typical colonies were subcultured on blood agar (Oxoid) and confirmed as C. jejuni and/or C. coli using MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). Susceptibility testing Animal isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using broth microdilution. MIC values were obtained using plates from Sensititre\u00ae (TREK Diagnostic LTD) with different panels depending on the bacterial species to be tested. Epidemiological cut-off values recommended by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST, accessed 20.03.2021) were used, except for sulfamethoxazole, colistin and azithromycin for Salmonella spp. where EFSA recommended cut-off values were used. For additional antimicrobial agents not defined in the EUCAST recommendations, cut-off values were defined on the basis of the actual MIC distributions obtained in the NORM-VET programme (see also Appendix 6 and Appendix 7). Quality assurance systems The following susceptible bacterial strains were included as quality controls on a regular basis: E. coli ATCC 25922, 33560. NVI has a quality assurance system according to the requirements of NS-EN ISO/IEC 17025. The participating laboratories at NVI are accredited according to the requirements of NS-EN ISO/IEC 17025, and participate in external quality assurance programmes for veterinary pathogens (Veterinary Laboratories Agency Quality Assurance Unit Loughborough, UK) and for resistance monitoring (EURL for Antimicrobial Resistance in Denmark), respectively. Data processing Susceptibility data were recorded and stored in the sample registration system at the NVI as discrete values (MIC). Data management was performed both in SAS-PC System\u00ae v 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc. Cary. NC. USA) and in R version 4.0.3 Copyright (C) 2020 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Platform), while the statistical analysis was performed in R. All changes and differences yielding a p-value < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. The 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the exact binomial test NORM - enteropathogenic bacteria Sampling strategy - humans All human isolates of Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica and Shigella were obtained from clinical cases. One isolate per patient or one isolate per recognised outbreak was included for susceptibility testing. Campylobacter isolates from a selection of a little less than 10% of registered campylobacteriosis cases were submitted in the following way: Five regional laboratories submitted the first five independent isolates each month to the NRL for Enteropathogenic Bacteria at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Identification of bacteria - human isolates The reference analyses on human clinical isolates of enteropathogenic bacteria were performed according to conventional methods described in standard reference literature (e.g. Murray PR & al.: Manual of Clinical Microbiology, 8th edition ASM-Press, Washington 2003 and Ewing WH: Edwards and Ewing's Identification of Enterobacteriaceae , 4. edition, Elsevier, New York 1986). Susceptibility testing human isolates Salmonella spp., Yersinia spp. and Shigella spp. isolates from humans were susceptibility tested at the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for Enteropathogenic Bacteria at the NIPH by agar disk diffusion tests according to the EUCAST standardised method for AMR testing of non-fastidious bacteria. Campylobacter isolates from humans were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using MIC Test Strips (Liofilchem). For human isolates, EUCAST clinical or epidemiological breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae , version 10.0 2020 were used if defined. In absence of clinical breakpoints, ECOFFs based on national zone distributions were used (e.g. tetracycline). Pefloxacin was used to infer ciprofloxacin resistance in Salmonella. Isolates with reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime or ceftazidime were tested for the presence of ESBL A by a double disk approximation test (BD Sensidisc), and for the presence of ESBL M by an AmpC detection test (Liofilchem MIC-test strips). Isolates with reduced susceptibility to meropenem were forwarded to the Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Detection of Antimicobial Resistance (K- Res) for further analyses. Genotyping All Enterobacterales isolates received at NRL from primary diagnostic laboratories in Norway were screened for antimicrobial resistance determinants using NCBI AMRFinderPlus following whole genome sequencing end, in 142Discrepancies phenotype and genotype were re- screened using the ResFinder 4.1 software and database online with default threshold and length settings. (https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ResFinder/). Quality assurance systems human isolates The NRL for Enteropathogenic Bacteria at the NIPH is accredited according to the requirements of NS-EN ISO/IEC 17025. E. coli ATCC 25922 was used as quality control strain for AMR testing of non-fastidious Enterobacteriaceae. The NRL participated in the external quality assessment programme of ECDC for Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Data processing human isolates The NRL at the NIPH stored susceptibility data of human isolates as either millimeter zone diameters or MIC values. The results were further analysed by WHONET 5.6 with the aid of the BacLink programme, both developed by Dr. John Stelling NORM / NORM-VET 2020 APPENDICES 143Appendix 5: Sampling, microbiological methods and data processing in NORM General considerations and sampling NORM is based on a combination of periodic sampling and testing in primary diagnostic laboratories, and annual results from national reference laboratories for specific microoganisms. Isolates are included from defined clinical conditions such as respiratory tract infections, wound infections, urinary tract infections, and septicaemiae. Surveillance schemes 2000-2020 are presented in the table below, for enteric infections see Appendix 4. In 2020, all 22 diagnostic laboratories in Norway participated in the surveillance system in addition to eleven reference laboratories. All diagnostic laboratories followed the same sampling strategy and used identical criteria for the inclusion of microbial strains. Only one isolate per patient and infectious episode was included unless otherwise stated. All microbes were identified using conventional methods as described in the ASM Manual of Clinical Microbiology. The surveillance period started in the beginning of January, and consecutive isolates were included for defined time periods for each surveillance category. The surveillance categories and sampling periods in 2020 were as follows: E. coli in blood cultures (6 months); Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus and and cerebrospinal fluids (12 months); S. aureus from wound specimens (1 week); S. pneumoniae from respiratory tract samples (3 weeks); E. coli (1 week) and Klebsiella spp. (3 weeks) from urinary tract infections; Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae from S. pneumoniae , S. pyogenes , H. influenzae and N. meningitidis from blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluids were analysed at the the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) in Oslo. N. gonorrhoeae was analysed at NIPH and Oslo University Hospital (OUS)/Ullev\u00e5l. isolates were analysed at OUS/Rikshospitalet. MRSA and S. agalactiae isolates were analysed at St. Olav University Hospital in Trondheim. M. tuberculosis isolates were analysed at NIPH, OUS/Ullev\u00e5l Susceptibility testing E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp. and S. aureus isolates were examined according to the EUCAST disk diffusion method using antibiotic disks and Mueller Hinton II agar from either Oxoid or Beckton Dickinson. Suitable antibiotics were selected for each bacterial species, and the results were interpreted according to the most recent breakpoints from NordicAST, which are harmonised with EUCAST. Beta-lactamase production in S. aureus and N. gonorrhoese was examined by nitrocefin disks, acidometric agar plates (3.6 mg/L penicillin G and phenol red) or clover leaf test. Enterococcus strains were screened for glycopeptide resistance using vancomycin 6 meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae were susceptibility tested using MIC gradient tests (bioMerieux or Liofilchem) on MH II Susceptibility testing of Candida spp. isolates was performed by MIC gradient tests using RPMI agar containing 2% glucose and MOPS. Resistance values were recorded as mm inhibition zone sizes or MIC values in order to monitor trends in the occurrence of resistance. M. tuberculosis isolates were tested using BACTEC MGIT 960 systems. All three test laboratories participate in the WHO external DST quality control programme. They were also tested for mutations in the rpoB gene to detect rifampicin resistance. Confirmation of resistance phenotypes E. coli and Klebsiella spp. with reduced susceptibility to 3rd generation cephalosporins were examined for ESBL production using ESBL combination MIC gradient tests (Liofilchem), disks (BD) or tablets (Rosco) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. S. aureus isolates with reduced susceptibility to cefoxitin were examined by mecA PCR for confirmation of methicillin resistance (MRSA). Enterococcus faealis and E. faecium isolates displaying growth on the vancomycin screening agar were examined by van PCRs. The MLS phenotype of erythromycin resistant S. aureus and S. pyogenes isolates was analysed using the double disk diffusion (DDD) synergy assay with erythromycin and clindamycin disks. Quality control The following strains were used for quality control: E. coli ATCC processing The specially designed web-based eNORM computer programme was used for registration and storage of patient data, sample data and resistance data. The results were further analysed by WHONET 5.6 with the aid of the BacLink programme, both developed by Dr. John Stelling. The distribution of microbial species in blood culture was based on extraction of routine data from the laboratory information systems of the participants. All isolates of the same species recovered within one month after the initial finding were considered duplicates and omitted from the survey. No attempts were made to evaluate the clinical significance of each finding.

This is because the sampling and also the classification of resistance differs between the programmes. Clinical breakpoints are used for the classification within NORM, while epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFF) are used for the classification of resistance within NORM-VET. The terms and usage of these two ways of classification of resistance are further explained below. The ECOFF would normally be lower for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and higher for disk diameters than the clinical breakpoints. However, this is not always the case. Epidemiological cut-off values Based on the distribution of the MIC values, or the inhibition zone diameter distribution, each bacterial population could (in an ideal case) be divided into two sub- populations by a biphasic curve as shown in the example above. The curve to the left (blue) shows the susceptible or wildtype distribution whereas the curve to the right (red) shows the resistant or non-wildtype distribution. The green line indicates a possible ECOFF value applicable to the distributions in the example. ECOFF may be used to detect emerging resistance in the bacterial populations. However, for several bacterial populations and corresponding tested antimicrobial substances these distributions may be overlapping. A part of the population within the overlapping area may carry resistance mechanisms and others not. In the area with the non- wildtype distribution, new resistance mechanisms are responsible for the resistance either alone or in addition to the resistance mechanisms present at lower MIC values. In order to establish MIC values for each specific bacterial population and antimicrobial agent, large amounts of data are collected and assessed. In the NORM-VET part of this report, we have mainly used the ECOFF values recommended by EUCAST. However, for some combi- nations of bacteria and antimicrobial agents these were not applicable to our data. In these cases, ECOFF values were defined on the basis of the actual MIC distributions obtained in the NORM-VET programme. We applied the normalised resistance interpretation (NRI) method with permission from the patent holder, Bioscand AB, T\u00c4BY, Sweden (European patent No 1383913, US Patent No. 7,465,559). The automatic and manual Excel programmes were made available through courtesy of P. Smith, W. Finnegan, and G. Kronvall and were applied on the clinical isolates of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae to define ECOFFs in EUCAST ECOFFs were missing. Clinical breakpoints Clinical breakpoints are defined in order to indicate if treatment of a specific pathogen is likely to succeed or not. Other factors like dosage and formulations also affect the clinical result. The MIC values are ideally obtained for the pathogen in vitro, and this is compared with the pre- determined clinical breakpoint to determine whether the organism is likely to respond in vivo. Term used to describe antimicrobial resistance levels In this report the levels of resistance (i.e. the percentage of resistant isolates among the tested isolates) in the NORM- VET programme have been classified according to the levels presented in The European Union Summary Report 2018/2019 (EFSA Journal >70% Distributions of MIC values 05101520253035 0,5 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 2048 MIC values% of isolatesSusceptible European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST, accessed 20.03.2021) were used. For additional antimicrobial agents not defined in the EUCAST recommendations, EFSA recommended cut-off values were used or cut-off values were defined on the basis of the actual MIC distributions obtained in the NORM-VET programme as described in Appendix 6. This was applied to the clinical isolates of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae , and for Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. The range for testing of A. pleuropneumoniae was too narrow for several of the included antimicrobials, thereby resulting in an uncomplete MIC distribution. For these cases, the ECOFFs were not defined.
