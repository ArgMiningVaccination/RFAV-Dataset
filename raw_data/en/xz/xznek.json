A century ago, spas in the United States were mineral springs, where visitors suffering from ailments such as arthritis, rheumatism or jangled nerves soaked in steamy, sulfurous waters. A 1950's spa was a fat farm, with a lettuce-leaf diet and a battery of beauty treatments. Fitness spas, where chirpy instructors screamed ''Feel the burn,'' typified the 1980's; everyone jumped and sweated for hours in big, mirror-lined rooms and almost never went outdoors. Now comes a new definition: the holistic spa. True to its New Age name, the holistic spa aims to treat the whole person -- mind, body and spirit -- and gently instill good habits meant to last long after the visit. The prototype calls for a diet of organically grown food that's healthy but ample (no more lettuce-leaf entrees), generous exercise with an emphasis on strength training, hiking and yoga (goodbye step aerobics) and exotic pampering treatments using techniques and natural ingredients from the Far East, ancient India or even the region around the spa. Health services, such as bone density tests, acupuncture and consultations with a nutritionist, are often included in the holistic approach. And to keep you in touch with nature, a waterfall or cactus forest should grace the grounds. ''A spa today is not about a massage,'' declared Horst Rechelbacher, founder of the Aveda Corporation, speaking last fall to the annual convention of the International Spa Association, an industry organization of spas, their owners, wellness instructors and service providers such as massage therapists, which has grown from 91 members in 1990 to more than 1,200. ''It's about everything -- healing, learning, relaxing, well-being -- and how it all integrates.'' Not every spa in the country is equipped, or even inclined, to provide an all-out holistic retreat. But the theme is pervasive as spas try to offer visitors a complete experience instead of a haphazard series of workouts, massages and meals. The model is the classic mind/body spa, which has been around, in various incarnations, for 60 years. The philosophy is that physical fitness isn't enough: you need to nourish and refresh your mind to be completely relaxed. And relaxation is the elusive but desirable commodity spas want to offer. In a recent survey, commissioned by the spa association, 61 percent of 351 people who had visited a destination, resort or cruise spa within the past year said they went to a spa to relax, followed by 13 percent who said pampering was their priority. Dramatic growth in the number and variety of spas is the other significant trend. In 1980 there were fewer than three dozen spas in the United States. Today there are more than 1,600, according to Bernard Burt, an industry consultant and a founding director of the spa association, ranging from day spas to resorts and cruise ships with spa amenities to full-blown destination spas. You'll even find a handful of old-fashioned mineral spring spas. Burnished by the strong economy, most of the growth is at the high end. Lower-priced spas still thrive, though it's unusual to find a full-service spa with overnight accommodations for under $135 a night a person, without treatments. Industry observers expect the growth to continue, particularly as the health-conscious baby boom generation ages. In the spa association survey, just 5 percent of nearly 28,000 respondents said they had been to a resort spa in the past year, but 25 percent said they were interested in staying at one. Spas are attracting younger visitors, as well, ''particularly day spas, where increasingly guests are 35 and under,'' said Peter C. Yesawich, whose marketing firm, Yesawich, Pepperdine & Brown, conducted the survey. In addition, 35 percent of visitors to the resort, cruise and destination spas are now men, the survey found. Not surprisingly, the growth is shaking up what was once a sleepy, if iconoclastic, cottage industry. In the past, the American trailblazers were destination spas that reflected the vision of a single individual, such as Deborah Szekely's sybaritic Golden Door in Escondido, Calif., or Sheila Cluff's sporty spa the Oaks in Ojai, Calif. But operating a spa has become so expensive, real estate concerns and large corporations are behind much of the recent expansion. Indeed, in 1998, the Golden Door was purchased by a Dallas real estate investment trust, which has since opened branches at resorts in Telluride, Colo., and Las Croabas, P.R. To aficionados, the destination spa, where clients immerse themselves in healthy living day and night, is the genuine spa experience. ''We make you stay for a week because that allows you the time to get into your mind and visualize peace,'' said Ms. Szekely, who also founded the Rancho La Puerta spa in Tecate, Mexico. ''It also builds a sense of community. If you know the woman next door will be your neighbor all week, you'll say 'hi.' '' But such spas are labor-intensive and costly to run. Though Mr. Burt estimates there are around 30 in North America (and just under 60 worldwide), no new ones are being built. To raise the destination spa profile, 25 of the best known, including the Greenhouse in Arlington, Tex., and Cal-a-Vie in Vista, Calif., recently banded together, producing a magazine and launching a Web site, www.destinationspas.com. Most of the growth is in day and resort spas. If a destination spa is a nutritious five-course meal, a day spa is a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice -- a quick gulp of health and indulgence. In tune with the holistic philosophy, the best day spas go beyond conventional massage and fete you with herbal tea and eye candy, such as waterfalls and greenery, as they dispense such services as Chinese herbology facials, hot stone massage, ear candling and acupuncture. Resort spas blend elements of the two, although depending on the resort, they vary enormously in scope. Generally, a resort spa provides many amenities of the destination spa with a more permissive diet and stays of almost any duration, even one night. As at a day spa, you can usually drop by for a scalp massage or an aromatherapy bath, even if you are not staying at the resort. Resorts allow you to graft a spa experience onto a conventional golf, beach, skiing or even theme-park vacation and provide the perfect holiday compromise when only one member of a couple wants to visit a spa. And because you can pick and choose spa activities, you determine how much wellness and herbal tea you can stand. In addition, children are often welcome. Spas outside the United States are evolving, too. As Europe's state-run health systems cut back financing for classic hydrotherapy treatments, many old-style hotel spas in France and Germany have closed. The survivors are spas in better quality hotels, particularly those with American-style treatments. Day spas are flourishing worldwide, as are spas fashioned as retreats that immerse visitors in a country's culture. And big international hotels in Asia are building American-style resort spas. ''ALL resorts and hotels, if they want to survive, will eventually have spas,'' said Raoul Andrews Sudre, president of Aspen Spa Management, a consulting firm in Fort Lauderdale. He predicts that big hotel chains will start their own schools, training spa staff to a uniform standard of service. ''It shouldn't be acceptable that four different estheticians do four different versions of the same treatment,'' he said. ''If you visit a Ritz-Carlton or a Holiday Inn, you know what to expect. But people don't always know what to expect at spas.'' So what can you expect from the spa of the future -- or the one you plan to visit next month? More than before, as spas new and old scramble to set themselves apart from the pack. An attractive building and adventurous pampering treatments are two obvious allures. Think of the classic old-style spa, a clinical, Mitteleuropean structure out of a black-and-white movie, more hospital than haven with boxy, windowless treatment rooms. It's history. The new and refurbished spas are integrating historical or geographical details into their architecture, creating light-filled buildings with high ceilings and windows galore. The Spa Ojai, part of the Ojai Valley Inn and Spa, resembles a California mission, while the Westglow Spa in Blowing Rock, N.C., looks like Tara. Mr. Sudre describes the newly renovated spa at La Mamounia hotel in Marrakech, Morocco, as a facility with touches of the Arabian Nights. ''A spa should give people the opportunity to live a dream, or be transported to another world,'' he said. Many spas choose to transport visitors to the natural world, with the creative use of woods, rocks, waterfalls, plants and windows. ''Losing touch with what's outside is what causes people to get so out of balance,'' said Jane Segerberg, president of the International Spa Association and former director of the Sea Island Spa at the Cloister in Sea Island, Ga. ''Your mind doesn't quiet unless it's with nature.'' Treatment rooms are friendlier, too. Treatment suites, where couples can indulge in simultaneous pampering, have become popular at spas like the Canyon Ranch Health Resort in Tucson, Ariz., and the lovely spa, in its own freestanding building across the Chao Phaya River, of the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok. Alfresco treatments are growing in appeal, too, at places like the Aquae Sulis spa at the Regent Las Vegas, which has a massage cabana. Like spa architecture, the newest pampering treatments are elaborate, individualistic and laced with fantasy. Prevailing influences are Asian; instead of Swedish massage, you'll see Shiatsu massage, Reiki and Thai yoga massage on trendier treatment menus. Watsu, a style of massage based on the principles of Shiatsu and performed as you float in a pool, was the talk of the spa association's convention and is offered by a growing number of spas, including Canyon Ranch. ''When you're in warm water, the massage has more effect on your body and spirit than when it's performed on land,'' said Michele Chelenza, whose company, Waterdanse Consulting, in Middletown, Calif., trains Watsu practitioners. High on the exotica charts is Aquae Sulis's Ela Kizhi rejuvenation treatment, based on the 7,000-year-old Siddha Vaidya system of herbal medicine, which purports to make skin look younger with the use of fresh herbs harvested from Hawaii and India during the monsoon season. ''We do about two dozen a week,'' said Patricia Schneider, the spa director, of the 80-minute treatment, which costs $225. For that holistic touch, spas are designing treatments that use local plants or traditional therapies. During the Adobe Clay Purification at the Spa at Marriott's Camelback Inn in Scottsdale, Ariz., adobe is applied to the skin, then washed off with a soap made from Southwestern plants and a cactus cloth, made from cactus ribs. Following a rubdown with juniper and sage oils, guests relax in the sauna ($110 for 60 minutes). Spa experts expect these treatments to become more personalized. ''Spas need to listen to what a client wants,'' said Mr. Rechelbacher. ''I hate lavender, and I remember a massage therapist saying, 'You'll like it because I do.' Well, I didn't, and she shouldn't have used it.'' To further distinguish themselves, spas are cultivating specialties. In the future, look for spas that provide child care, particularly for new mothers who want to get back in shape after having a baby. Or spas specializing in treating alcohol and drug abusers. And more spas will provide healing and recovery centers for patients who have undergone plastic surgery. Medical-service spas are already a fast-growing niche. As health insurance companies cut back on preventive care, spas have stepped in with services such as cholesterol tests, bone density scans, cardiac stress tests, nutritional analysis, fitness assessments, even physician consultations. Spas provide a controlled environment in which to foster healthy eating, exercise and lifestyle habits. ''People used to ask how to lose weight and look 10 years younger, but now they're coming with health questions,'' said Kristine Huffman, health and healing director at Canyon Ranch in the Berkshires in Lenox, Mass. SPAS that don't have a health team on staff may look to outside sources. Last year, Dr. Florence Comite, an associate clinical professor at Yale University School of Medicine, initiated Destinations Health, a customized preventative care program for 35-to-55-year-old women that is available at the Noelle Spa for Beauty and Wellness, a day facility in Stamford, Conn., and the Spa Ojai. Before visiting the spa, participants fill out a questionnaire that is evaluated by a team in Connecticut. During the spa visit, a health and longevity portfolio is created that makes recommendations in areas such as diet, exercise and stress reduction. ''It's a health road map, with information on how to prevent disorders of aging and make the most of your health assets,'' said Dr. Comite, who plans to implement the program at additional spas. It costs $1,800 at Ojai and $1,500 at Noelle. Escape -- from stress, worries and screaming kids -- is, of course, a classic spa specialty that will continue to flourish. Consider the town of Hershey, yes, that's Hershey, Pa. With a theme park, chocolate museum and candy factory tours, Hershey is a children's fantasy, but what about their parents? This fall the Hotel Hershey will open a spa, and is planning luxurious grown-up treatments like rose petal baths and milk and honey body wraps. Can cocoa-powder exfoliants and "}
