Since homeopathic medicines are prepared by a potentizing method using alcohol, past a certain dilution, their toxicity/infectivity is assumed to be unlikely. We aimed to develop a bridge study between homeopathic pathogenetic trials and clinical trials. The primary purpose was to evaluate the safety of a nosode, developed from clinical samples of a COVID-19 patient. The secondary objectives were to explore whether a nosode developed for a specific clinical purpose, such as use during an epidemic, may elicit laboratory signals worthy of further exploration. Methods: An open-label study was designed to evaluate the safety and immune response of the Coronavirus nosode BiosimCovex, given orally on three consecutive days to ten healthy volunteers. Clinical examinations, laboratory safety and immune parameters were established. Interferon-gamma, Interleukin-6, and CD 4 were measured. (CTRI registration number: CTRI/2020/05/025496). Results: No serious/fatal adverse events were reported. Laboratory tests to measure safety were unchanged. Three subjects showed elevated Interleukin-6 (IL-6) on day 17 in comparison to the baseline, and ten subjects showed elevated IL-6 on day 34. A significant difference between IL-6 observations, calculated by repeated measures ANOVA, was found to be highly significant. On day 60, the IL-6 values of nine subjects were found to return to normal. Corresponding CD4 cell elevation was observed on day 60, when compared to day 34.

Introduction [1](#B1-medicines-10-00008)]. The continued need for supportive prophylaxis measures, immunotherapeutics and immunomodulators which may contribute to controlling pandemics; therefore, we considered the development of potentized preparations (nosodes) [ [2](#B2-medicines-10-00008)]. [3](#B3-medicines-10-00008)]. It is assumed that there is little or no toxicological risk remaining past a certain potency when consumed by human subjects. For example, the potentization process leading to a 30C potency, has led to an extreme dilution, making the concentration difficult to measure In addition, the process kills any organism in the original material (bacteria or virus, in the case of nosodes) due to the continued and repeated exposure of the organism to approximately 90% alcohol, used as a medium for dilution at every step. As a consequence, human trials for safety have typically not been a practice for new or old homeopathic drug discovery. Instead, the model of the Homeopathic Pathogenetic Trial (HPT/drug proving) was developed to understand the primary effects of the drug substance by recording symptoms during the trial, which help determine the therapeutic indications, based on the fundamental homeopathic principle of the law of Similars. Such primary effects are recorded in the source books, such as Materia Medica Pura (by TF (by Constantine Hering [ [5](#B5-medicines-10-00008)]). [6](#B6-medicines-10-00008), [7](#B7-medicines-10-00008)] that are fully or partly 'proved' in human trials and have been used by practitioners the world over for the past two centuries. They are made available across homeopathic pharmacies, as over-the-counter products, or as dietary supplements, depending on national regulatory requirements. Potentized homeopathic drugs that have been in use for over one hundred years were not required to undergo any toxicity studies in animals or safety studies in humans. [8](#B8-medicines-10-00008)]. The Act does not ask for animal or human toxicity studies for homeopathic medicines. [9](#B9-medicines-10-00008)] showed that homeopathic 'vaccines' do not elicit antibody responses against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and MMR. If nosodes provide some level of protection during epidemics, they may do so by a mechanism different to that of conventional vaccines. [10](#B10-medicines-10-00008)] technique with the safety testing commonly found in Phase I drug trials; this study tests the new medicine BiosimCovex (Coronavirus nosode/CVN01). Secondly, since this medicine is developed for its potential use as a protective prophylaxis in the current COVID-19 pandemic, we examined whether a homeopathically-prepared medicine may elicit certain blood value changes related to immune response, which may signal potential therapeutic use. Specifically, with a need for generating scientific data, the present study does not only investigate IgG/IgM levels against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein, but also includes other immune parameters that may potentially impact disease presentation. We included the study of relevant immunomodulatory effects. IL-6 promotes the specific differentiation of naive CD4 T cells, thus performing an important function in linking the innate to the acquired immune response [ [11](#B11-medicines-10-00008)]. Objective 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. BiosimCovex (Coronavirus Nosode) [12](#B12-medicines-10-00008)] of an oropharyngeal swab of a patient; its use had been approved by the institutional Ethics and Biosafety Committee having confirmed, by RT-PCR and genome sequencing, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 at Haffkine Institute, Mumbai. This followed the nosode-making guidelines, as per the Homeopathy Pharmacopoeia of India, and the Standard Operating Procedure, approved by the Life Force Foundation Trust's Scientific Advisory Body [ [13](#B13-medicines-10-00008), [14](#B14-medicines-10-00008)]. This nosode is prepared from a clinical sample, as mentioned in the N-IV group in the HPI [ [13](#B13-medicines-10-00008)]. Almost Tuberculinum Carcinosin, Syphilinum) in the homeopathic literature and available on the market have been made from the clinical samples [ [15](#B15-medicines-10-00008)]. The ethical and biosafety approvals for the preparation of the nosode were obtained from the applicable institutional committees. The samples were handled, and the potencies were prepared in a Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) containment lab with BSL-3 practices. Standard precautions, as per biosafety requirements, were followed during the preparation process. [16](#B16-medicines-10-00008)]. Potencies 1C to 4C were prepared by using Water for Injection (WFI) as a vehicle. In total, 0.03 mL of OSN was taken in a suitable glass bottle, allowing one-third space for succussion and the 2.97 mL of WFI that was added to make a 3 mL volume. The bottle was given 10 strokes with the help of a hand-potentizer in a bio-safety cabinet to arrive at 1C potency. As per the method of preparation described in the HPI, the 1:99 ratio was maintained for further potencies. The nosode, in its final preparation, was delivered on a dry size 30 globule, without alcohol present. Finally, for safety, RT-PCR confirmed that no Coronavirus was detected beyond the 3C potency. To document that usable 30C potency is also devoid of any viral material, above 3C potencies were also tested by using RT-PCR. 2.2. Study Design 2.3. Study Sample [Figure 1](#medicines-10-00008-f001)). The basic demographic information is presented in [Table 1](#medicines-10-00008-t001). Subjects who currently had or were recently diagnosed with COVID-19 infections were excluded from the study. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria included the following: 2.4. Inclusion Criteria 2.5. Exclusion Criteria 2.6. Study Method 2.7. Approvals 2.8. Study End Points and Statistical Assessments 2.9. Safety Assessments 2.10. Safety Parameters 2.11. Immune Response Laboratory Method Parameters 3. Results [Table 2](#medicines-10-00008-t002)). The P-value results of CBC, CRP, LFT, and the Serum ferritin level for all subjects at baseline, compared to day 17, were unchanged, and in the normal reference range. The subjects were closely monitored and did not show any abnormal clinical changes. Based on these findings, no safety concerns were observed in the study population. [Table 3](#medicines-10-00008-t003)) The subjects did not show any clinically untoward symptoms during the time of the elevated IL-6 values. On the CD4 panel, the absolute CD4 count showed a significant elevation following the IL-6 timeframe on day 60, in comparison to day 34. ( [Table 4](#medicines-10-00008-t004)). Individual supporting data presented the process. [21](#B21-medicines-10-00008)]. [22](#B22-medicines-10-00008)]. [8](#B8-medicines-10-00008)]. The excessive or sustained production of IL-6 is involved in various diseases [ [23](#B23-medicines-10-00008)]. [24](#B24-medicines-10-00008)]. Importantly, they are both investigated as predictors of outcomes, including mortality. For example, IFN- is investigated as an independent risk factor associated with mortality in the moderate and severe presentation of COVID-19 [ [25](#B25-medicines-10-00008)]. Indeed, an emerging strategy is aimed directly at reversing the decline in health status and lowering mortality rates in the acutely COVID-19 ill patient [ [26](#B26-medicines-10-00008), [27](#B27-medicines-10-00008)]. [28](#B28-medicines-10-00008)]. [29](#B29-medicines-10-00008)] had reported an increase in cytokines, including IL-6, as an immune response following vaccination. An initial mild rise in IL-6 may be considered a positive sign of immune response. They had also reported a time-dependent elevation in intracellular cytokine production in monocytes with the highest levels found at around day 28. In our study, subjects began showing an increase in IL-6 on day 17, all having a significant rise by day 34, and subsequent decline by day 60. This corresponded to an increase in CD4 count by day 60, as compared to day 34 in 7 subjects, thereby potentially suggesting the activation of innate immunity in response to the nosode. [30](#B30-medicines-10-00008)]. We observed IL-6 elevation with a potential increase in the CD4 helper cell count at corresponding visits, which is again an expressive marker of immunity. [31](#B31-medicines-10-00008)] is well studied, we did not observe any CRP [Baseline (1.4), day 17 (1.61), and day 34 (1.9)] elevation in this study. Lymphocyte count was measured after IL-6 data demonstrated results; therefore, no baseline data is available. With Lymphocyte counts remaining in the normal range, there could be no fear that autoimmunity is triggered by this nosode. [32](#B32-medicines-10-00008)]. [10](#B10-medicines-10-00008)]. While a larger placebo-controlled HPT could be conducted in the future to elicit more symptoms, the effects of the COVID-19 virus are well understood due to their pandemic prevalence, and it may not be imperative to conduct symptomatic HPT for its immediate prescribing as a prophylactic or therapeutic indication. Indeed, in a related study, the authors conducted a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled feasibility study, evaluating the efficacy of homeopathic medicines in the prevention of COVID-19 in a quarantined population. In 2233 quarantined individuals who were exposed to people diagnosed with COVID-19, the subjects in the BiosimCovex arm reported signals of efficacy, with a significantly smaller number of individuals testing COVID-19 positive compared to the placebo group, as well as a shorter duration of illness compared to the placebo [ [33](#B33-medicines-10-00008)]. [34](#B34-medicines-10-00008)]. If there is some level of protection afforded by homeopathic prophylaxis, it may be useful for those who are unable to tolerate vaccines or do not have access to them. [35](#B35-medicines-10-00008)], it is imperative to search for alternate immune preventive or therapeutic measures. 5.
