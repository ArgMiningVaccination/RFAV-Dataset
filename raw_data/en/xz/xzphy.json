In essence, we need supplements for two reasons: 1) to replace nutrient s that are missing from our foods and bodies because of th e way they are grown (such as depleted soils, long period s of travel), processed (high heat); and 2) to help the body detoxify and defend against toxins that have got in to our body through food, air, water and other means (such as cosmetics). 2) What if I eat well, and mostly organic foods? This does not fully correct the issues discussed in ques tion 1 above. 3) How many pills do I have to take? We classify supplements into those that are \"core\" and those th at are therapeutic. Core supplements are those that we ne ed to take for the rest of our lives to achieve and maint ain optimal health. These include: a omega-6 oils), and probably pro-biotic bacteria. Therapeutic supplements are those that a re required to correct deficiencies based on lab tests (such as magnesium, vitamins B12 and D), symptoms, or other factors. These will be taken for a period of time, usually 3- 12 months. 4) What if I have problems tolerating supplements? The most common difficulties are with B vitamins (u sually in multi's) and with fish oils. Usually this is du e to sub- optimal digestion, is an important clue to why you may be deficient in the first place. This can usually be remedied by the addition of the appropriate digestive aids. We will begin your supplement program slowly, and ramp it u p over several weeks to months. We will see you thre e weeks after beginning your supplement program to mo nitor tolerance and make appropriate adjustments. We wil l repeat blood tests and other measurements after 2-3 months. If absorption is sub-optimal, additional i mportant evaluations will be indicated. See question 15 for more information about intolerance. 5) Don't most supplements end up in the toilet? There are two considerations here. First, the supplement s should be tested for their ability to dissolve and be abso rbed. Also, while some supplements pass through your body , as does water, what is important is their effect on yo ur body as they turn on and off certain metabolic processes (in part, \"programming\" your genetic tendencies in the right direction). 6) What about the quality of the supplements? Supplements are sometimes called \"nutriceuticals\", implying that they are as important as pharmaceutic als (drugs). Indeed they have the advantage of having a higher benefit-to-risk ratio than most drugs. In other wo rds, they usually have a very low side-effect profile. Dr. C heikin and staff have spent hundreds of hours researching the various companies and their products for quality an d cost- effectiveness. Most companies we support use \"GMP\" or Good Manufacturing Practice, and some use independe nt labs to ensure the potency and purity of their prod ucts. We believe the supplements we provide are the best \"ba ng for your buck\" and will give your the best chance of ac hieving optimal health. We use these same supplements for ourselves and our families. 7) What if I can buy cheaper supplements locally or on the internet? We have chosen the ones we carry because of their cost-effectiveness. If there was a brand that was equivalent and cheaper, we would carry it. The sma ll amount you can save is not worth the time and risk of sub- optimal results. We take your concerns seriously a nd have formulated your program to achieve optimal results in the most efficient way. 8) Can't I take my supplements once a day? No. Most are designed to take with meals to reinforce what i s in the food. We don't eat, drink or breathe once a day; t aking supplements once a day will not get the desired res ults. This is in part because many supplements are water soluble and only last in your body six hours. While the op timal frequency is three to four times a day, a compromis e is twice a day. (Some special supplements will be tak en between meals or at bedtime). 9) How can I make my supplement program easier? Having the right tools for any job is essential. O pening 4- 10 bottles twice a day is not sustainable or conven ient. Therefore, having the right pill containers is esse ntial. They should be large enough to hold all your mornin g or evening supplements for a week. We also recommend ones that lock if you travel or have small grand/childre n in your home or car. Dr. Cheikin has successfully used 10 containers for his monthly program: am and pm conta iners for weeks 1-4, plus a second week 4 so that weeks 1 -4 can be filled up while finishing week 4 from the prior month. Most supplements come in one-month supplies, which enables such a strategy. Also, keeping your pill containers in a visible an d functional place (kitchen cabinet with morning tea, refrigerator, bathroom sink etc.) can be helpful. Finally, keeping a log and checking it off can serve as an i mportant tool (Dr. Cheikin tapes such a log inside his kitch en cabinet). 10) What if I forget a dose? It doesn't pay to double up. Realistically, if you take your supplements 10-12 t imes out of a maximum of 14 times (7 days times 2x/day), you are doing pretty well. 11) How long will it take for the supplements to wo rk? How will I know they are working? Because most 3/24/08-2 subfaq_b.wpf \"Supplement FAQ's\" M Cheikin MD Page 2 supplements work at the cellular level, it takes a while for them to get into your cells, push out other compoun ds (such as previously ingested hydrogenated oils), an d adjust the biochemistry of each cell. This may take sever al months. The positive effects usually sneak up on y ou. Likewise, if your supplement program lapses (which happens from time-to-time to the best of us!), you will sustain the benefits for a week or two and then beg in to slip back to where you began. You then restart your supplements and begin to improve again. This A-B-A -B design is a valid method for testing the effectiven ess of any intervention. 12) I am a vegetarian. Are your supplements free o f animal products? Most supplements, with the exception of \"fish oils\" are vegetarian. 13) I take flax or hemp oil for my omega-3 oils. I s this sufficient? In most cases, this is not. Most of us only convert 5-10% of flax oil's alpha linolenic acid in to the anti-inflammatory DHA/EPA in fish oil. If the aver age adult needs at least 2000 mg of DHA/EPA, this means that they would have to take 10-20 times this amount as flax or hemp oil. For those vegetarians who are adamant ab out not taking fish oils, there are other alternatives that are more expensive but available. We can also do a \"fatty a cid analysis\" to measure the balance of oils in your bo dy. We do recommend that all patients take DHA/EPA at leas t for a while. 14) What if I cannot afford the supplement program? Can I take less? This is similar to the issue of not being able to afford medications or other health care. T hese supplements are cheaper than the equivalent (which there often is none) in drugs, though we have the illusio n that drugs are \"being covered by health insurance\". Ult imately, we pay for them. Since we are designing an optimal program for you, taking less that what is recommended will not achie ve optimal results in optimal time. However, sometime s, a compromise is necessary. At other times, it is a m atter of reviewing priorities. Most people would spend a fa r greater amount than we are recommending to fix thei r car, or care for their teeth or pet. We would prefer that you are honest with us about your situation and priorities. For your convenienc e, we do accept credit cards. We are also exploring options for payment plans. Since we are committed to your heali ng and wellness, we will do all we can within reason to wo rk out a plan that you can afford. We also encourage patien ts to explore HSA's (Healthcare Savings Accounts) with th eir employers, which can be used to pay for supplements provided by a physician for a specific medical diag nosis. 15) What if I have an undesired reaction to my supplements and can't tell which is doing it? You should stop all new supplements for a few days and then add one in at a time, starting with the one you are most suspicious of. If this doesn't work, either email Dr. Cheikin, call the office or schedule an earlier vis it. Please do not waste a month or more while waiting for your next appointment. 16) What if I don't eat breakfast or don't eat enou gh to take all my supplements? As long as you spread them over the day, you can take them at other times, suc h as lunch and dinner. However, they should be taken at least two hours before bedtime. (However, certain specif ic supplements are to be taken at bedtime). 17) What if I can't get back to the office before m y supplements run out? We can mail your supplements to you, usually at a cost less than gas and your time. We routinely mail supplements on Wednesdays if your re quest is called or emailed in by noontime Monday. We can also mail supplements at other times or overnight if the additional cost is worthwhile to you. 18) What if my other doctor(s) and/or family/ frien ds do not believe in supplements? We can provide quality information to support the use of supplements. It is easily to prove their safety when compared to drugs, which are in the top five causes of illness and death in our cou ntry. 19) What is the role of digestive enzymes, acid and probiotic bacteria in supplement regimens? This is a complex but very important topic that is addressed in separate publications. Please ask if you want copi es or go to the website and review the articles on \"Stomach Acid\", \"Enzymes\" (pending), and \"GI and Inflammation\" and \"Yeast\" (for information on probiotics). 20) What if I don't want to take supplements? Holistic Medicine offers many paths to healing. While suppl ements are an important tool, they are not the only one. If you are willing to endure a slower healing process, and the cost of other modalities, then some people can achieve sati sfactory results without supplements.
