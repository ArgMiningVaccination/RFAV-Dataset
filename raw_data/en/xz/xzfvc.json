At its core, whole-person health is self-care. It's recognizing that your body has needs and taking action to meet those needs. It requires making choices that help you function optimally and thrive across different areas of life. Key Concepts of Whole Person Health Bio-Individuality - The idea that everyone has unique needs that may change over time and what works for one person won't necessarily work for another. Multidimensional Health - The idea that different aspects of health are interconnected, such as physical health, mental health, emotional health, and spiritual health. Sustainable Shifts - Small shifts in habits, practices, or behaviors that are implemented one at a time to create long-term change that feels doable. Physical Health Physical health is the condition of your body and includes everything from nutrition and the absence of disease to genetics and your fitness level. This may be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of health, and while it's important, it's only one aspect of whole-person health. It also encompasses the strategies that support you in taking care of yourself, which may include eating nutrient -dense foods, staying hydrated, getting adequate rest and sleep, breathing deeply, and engaging in regular exercise and movement. Mental Health Mental health is the condition of your mind - from your mind- set and the way you speak to yourself to your relationship with stress and even your ability to cope with challenges. It also encompasses the strategies that support you in taking care of yourself, which may include practicing gratitude, choosing to learn from obstacles, reframing stories that keep you stuck, allowing space for emotions, and looking at the bigger picture. Mental health is intricately linked with emotional health as it means being able to be present with your feelings and accept them for what they are as well as utilizing tools and strategies to work with your emotions rather than ignoring or fighting against them. Emotional Health Emotional health is the condition of your emotions and includes your relationship with yourself and others as well as your ability to tune in to, accept, and manage feelings through challenges and change. It also encompasses the strategies that support you in taking care of yourself, which may include expressing your feelings in meaningful ways, practicing mindfulness, creating space for personal interests, and surrounding yourself with people who support you. Like other areas of health, it's a muscle you strengthen through experiences over time. Spiritual Health Spiritual health is the condition of your spirit and is a broad concept with opportunity for many perspectives. Though it's often linked with a sense of connection to something greater than yourself, spiritual health also includes how your personal identity helps fulfill your purpose. Having spiritual awareness can help you find meaning and individual purpose in your life and can help you live in a way that reflects your values, morals, and beliefs. Spiritual health also encompasses the strategies that support you in taking care of yourself, which may include being part of a community with others who share similar beliefs, serving others, aligning your values with your actions, and being open to new ideas and perspectives as you explore your unique path. 1.
