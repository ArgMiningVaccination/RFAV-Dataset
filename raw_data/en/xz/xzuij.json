The trimesters flow and build from one to the next, and the coursework is sequenced to provide a rich and transformative educational experience, as summarized below. Level 1 Students are introduced to MUIH's foundational philosophical principles, living within the rhythms of nature, living with mindfulness, and the skillful and purposeful use of language as tools for being a powerful healing presence and catalyst for change. An intensive on healership that introduces students to the art, practice, and science of being a healing presence is followed by coursework designed to open up the power of observation and sensory awareness. Level 2 Coursework delves deeper into the topics introduced in Level I, focusing on theory, diagnosis, treatment planning, and skills development. Students begin supervised clinical work and train at the oncampus faculty-supervised clinic and at the off-campus Community Clinic Sites. Near the end of this level, each student will take the Level II Comprehensive Exam. Upon passing the exam, the student may begin the expanded clinical portion of the program. Level 3 Level III begins with a three-day off-campus retreat. The retreat serves as a bridge between the academic work of Levels I and II, and the clinical experience of Level III. Over the course of Level III, each student generates a minimum of 10 patients, and completes, under supervision, a minimum of 250 treatments. In addition, each student performs at least 180 treatments on patients at Community Clinic Sites (begun in Level II). Beyond the increased clinical focus, Level III coursework focuses more deeply on advanced topics in theory, diagnosis, treatment planning, and skills development. Flex core courses are core programmatic courses however they are categorized as \"flex core\" because of the flexibility of when a student can take these courses. All other programmatic courses follow a structured timeline. MUIH offers herbal medicine programs that vary in their foundational philosophies and how herbs are used to promote health and wellness. "}
