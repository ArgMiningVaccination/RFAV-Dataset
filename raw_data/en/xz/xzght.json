Some of the [conditions treated](https://www.michironeuro.com/ncc/conditions-treated/) are: peripheral entrapments, shoulder/elbow/wrist issues, hip/knee/ankle/foot issues, sports injuries, auto injuries, whiplash and much more. Not only are adjustments utilized in these cases, they are often combined with a variety of manual therapies, exercises and home exercises to promote lasting results. Our goal is to enable patients to live their lives fully and not require weekly care. Due to our unique combination of chiropractic adjustments and manual therapy, the majority of our patients are seen on a monthly basis once their issues have been alleviated. Since every individual is unique, the same adjustment is not used with everyone\u2014many factors need to be considered when performing adjustments on a patient. One patient may require a light, low-force technique such as Activator or Impulse, while others may need a full-spine approach, in which a high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust is delivered and joint cavitation is obtained. Below is a description of the various chiropractic techniques we use. GONSTEAD & DIVERSIFIED [Learn More](http://gonstead.com/) EXTREMITY ADJUSTMENTS The misalignment of a joint not only occurs in the spine, it can also manifest in the extremities. An extremity adjustment can be performed for TMJ issues and on shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees, ankles and more. These adjustments can be used to reduce scar tissue and tight muscles, to help patients recover from an injury, to re-educate joint motion and to restore normal function to the joint. IMPULSE NEUROMECHANICAL TECHNIQUE This patented and FDA-registered device was specifically created to deliver gentle and precise chiropractic adjustments to the joints of the spine and extremities to relieve pain and restore function. The impulse-adjusting instrument produces a controlled force that chiropractors can use to treat different areas of the body. The Impulse device is twice as fast as other adjusting instruments and 100 times faster than doing manual adjustments because its gentle thrust happens faster than the body's tendency to tighten up and resist the adjustment. The Impulse has three different force settings to accommodate different parts of the body and to treat patients of all ages. The thrust frequency is specifically attuned to the natural frequency of the body's joints, muscles and nerves to optimize results, and the controlled low-force thrust of the Impulse device makes treatments comfortable. ACTIVATOR More clinical and scientific peer-reviewed papers have been published about the Activator device than about many other chiropractic analytical treatment procedures. The Activator is a mechanical, low-force, manually assisted adjusting instrument that is recognized and covered by insurance. It is safe and easy to use with patients of all ages. THOMPSON TECHNIQUE The Thompson Technique uses an adjusting table with a pneumatically driven, segmented drop system that quickly lowers sections of the patient's body that correspond with the spinal region being adjusted. The doctor thrusts at high speed while using minimal force, and as the thrust initiates movement, the fast drop carries the joint through the remainder of its range of motion. Thompson practitioners use leg length checks, palpation, X-rays, and other appropriate tests to determine where to adjust. Pregnancy Care For decades, chiropractic care has yielded great results for pregnant women, not only in reducing back pain but also in improving the overall quality of life during pregnancy. When a woman has the job of creating another life, pain should be the last thing affecting her nervous system! In addition to reducing pain, the Webster technique has shown positive results in promoting the proper positioning of the baby for delivery. COX FLEXION/DISTRACTION Cox\u00ae Technic is a research-documented spinal manipulation that relieves lower back pain, neck pain, arm pain, leg pain, and a host of spinal conditions, including disc herniation, spinal stenosis, post-surgical continued pain and pregnancy-related back pain. For nearly 50 years, Cox\u00ae Technic's developer, Dr. James M. Cox, has been documenting the science of this nonsurgical alternative approach to back pain relief.
