[Sign Up for the Global Network for Spirituality and Health](/form/gnsah-membership-application) Global Network for Spirituality and Health Patrons and Affiliates - Call to the World - Welcome! The Call to the World originated as a project of the Health Professions Advisory Council of the Fetzer Institute. The project was created to learn from and about exemplars of love and forgiveness in the health care arena. At its heart, it was intended to illuminate the underlying motivations of love, compassion, and forgiveness that are manifest in these exemplars, and which are so profoundly needed in the health sector today. Given their great alignment of purpose, the project is delighted to join at this time with the Global Network for Spirituality and Health.
