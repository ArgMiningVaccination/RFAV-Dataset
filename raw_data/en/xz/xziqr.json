The aim of the project in Lincolnshi re has been to explore the potential for changes in care pathways for people with dem entia, and hence identify potential related chan ges to se rvice provision across health a nd social care s ervice s. The central focus of the project was a surv ey of 863 adult inpatie nt case notes which took place across Lincolnshire on 29 Nove mber 2006. These patients were in a range of places but included all those in : medical and orthopaedic beds in acute hospitals (667 patients) interm ediate care p lacem ents in comm unity hosp ital and care hom es (121) specialist inpatient beds for older people with m ental health problem s (OPMH) (75) Any 'outlier' patients of these special ties were also included. Patients in other surgical, obstetric, psychiatric and paedia tric spec ialties we re excluded f rom the survey, as w ere day cases. The val idated Appropriateness Evalua tion Protocol (AEP) instrument was used to assess the need for acute inpatient care bot h at adm ission and on the day of the survey. For the com munity hosp itals and care hom e placem ents custom ised protocols were agreed to allow assessment of altern ative ways of m eeting needs outside the current setting. Some key findings were: 715 out of 863 patients surveyed (83%) were aged 65 or over. 111 patients (13%) had a docum ented di agnosis of de mentia. 65 of the 111 patients with dem entia (59%) were on acute hospital wards. Patients with dem entia in OPMH units tended to be younger than those in acute hosp ital or inte rmediate care, and have few m edical problem s. There m ay be significant under diagno sis or under recording of de mentia. Possible reasons include a wish to av oid patients being restricted from access ing so me care settings, and the inciden ce of vascular dem entia, which may not t with spe cialist OPMH s ervices. Relativ ely few adm issions for people with dem entia to acute hospita l app eared to be avoidable, however there were a substan tial num ber that f ell within AEP criteria but m ight have been avoida ble if adm itting physicians had known the medical history. The m ajority of acute h ospita l patie nts with de mentia (68%) were ou tside AEP criteria on the day of care. Potential alte rnative c are settings covered the full range of services, both generic and speci alist. In most cases the need is fo r some intervention to ens ure thes e patien ts are ab le to access the sam e care and treatment services ou tside hospi tal as people without dem entia. The Balan ce of Care Group 1 There was a substantial and unm et nee d, identified in both acute and OPMH settings, for rehabilitation support that can work with people with dem entia, and for EMI continu ing care p lacem ents. These findin gs are com pared with th ose for other health and s ocial care econom ies in England. The repor t discusse s the im plications of the findings, which need to be taken forward jointly by Lincolnshire P CT, United Lincolns hire Hospitals N HS Trust, Lincolnshire Partnership Trust and Lincolnshire S ocial Services. An initia l stag e would be to develop a common view of de sirable changes to care pa thways, and how to effect them , followed by consideration of re source and capacity im plications. Although the survey included a ll medical and orthopaedic patients, whether or not diagnosed w ith dem entia, we have not re ported here results for the whole survey population. However summary analyses and an onym ised source data are being m ade available to all pa rticip ating organisations so that related whole system issues can be addressed.

PROJECT BACK GRO UND AND METHODOLOGY Introductio n The National Audit Office (NAO) is undert aking a value for money study exam ining the health an d social care services availabl e to help older people with dem entia and their carers to m aintain good physical and m ental health for as long as possible. The NAO is addressing the following questions: Is there a clear vision and strategy fo r providing services for people with dementia and their carers? At each stag e of de mentia, diagnosis, community care and lon g-term care, are current and future needs understood and being met in an integrated, patient- centred way? Is the whole system cost-effective? The study has several simultaneous work str eams one of which is the project detailed in this report, an in -depth study of the num bers of pe ople with dem entia in a typical range of bed-based care services within a local h ealth and so cial care eco nomy (excluding long-term care settings). The project has been concerned to provide evidence ab out current access to serv ices by people with dem entia and in particular: An assessment of the ex tent to whic h admissions could be avoided or length of stay redu ced if alternativ e approach es to dem entia care n eeds were introd uced Identificatio n of alternative care p athways and services to deliver them A description of how the whole system operates and how diffe rent services interact with each other Evidence regarding good practice Important issues here are whether appropria te alternative care settings m ight be identified for future developm ent, and th e extent to which people with dem entia typica lly ha ve other, ad dition al co-morbidi ties and health a nd socia l care needs. The Balance of Care Group, which has expertis e in undertaking this type of analysis, was comm issioned to undertake this part of the overall NAO work programme in close association with the Lincolnshire health and social care community. This included the Lincolnshire Part nership Trust (LP T), Lincolnshire Prim ary Care Trust, United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust (U LH) and Lincolnshire Social Services who have jointly recognised the need fo r a whole system s approach to redesigning services. As well as providing data for the overa ll NAO programm e, the project was also designed to provide insight and support for local requirem ents in taking forward services for people with dem entia, particularly in term s of the scope for future service delivery m odels. This report summ arises key fi ndings from the survey with respect to these local issues, and w ill provide a cas e study f or inclusion in the NAO national report. The focus of the pro ject was a bed utilis ation survey across m edical and orthopaed ic beds in the four m ain hospitals of the United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust; the The Balan ce of Care Group 4three community hospitals run by L incolnshi re PCT and associated interm ediate care bed places provided in care hom es across the county; and the inpatient beds for older people with m ental health problem s (OPMH) run at three sites by the Lincolnshire Partnership Trust (s ee appendix I). The aim of the survey w as to id entify, for each patient, whether their care needs m ight have been m et in an alte rnative care setting, either avoiding adm ission altogether , or through earlier discharge. For patients in the a cute hospita ls the surv ey used a recognised clinical benchm ark tool, the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (AEP ) to iden tify patients whose care needs m ight not requ ire an acute hosp ital setting (see append ix II). The p rotocol was also used (although in a slightly different way) for patients in the OPMH beds in order to try and identify any specifically acute medical needs in those settings over and above m ental health issues. Sim ilar questi ons of alternative care settings were investigated in the community hosp itals and care hom e settin gs (but with out recou rse to the AEP). The project was initiated in Septem ber 2006 and the bed usag e survey too k place on 29 Nove mber 2006. W orkshops to check the inte rpretation of initia l results took place with som e of the survey ors in early Decem ber. Subsequent discuss ions on the findin gs took place with senior m anagers of partic ipating organisations and a workshop with the local project S teering Group in early January 2007. This was also an opportunity to present extended analyses including data on discharge dates and locations of the survey population. In this way, survey findings have been subject to extensive discussion and interpretation in a range of feedback sessions, workshops and presentations. These sessions focussed on issues relating particular ly to care for people with dem entia or related health and social care needs. The m aterial presented h ere follows that focus an d, unless s ignificant for understanding the differential needs of people with dem entia, findings for the overall hospital population are not included. On this we note that overall patient characteristics were sim ilar to populations that we have surveyed elsewhere. Som e summary analyses and the source d ata are al so being m ade available to the various organisations that supported this exercise. The survey database is rich and can be analysed in m any different ways. Results presented here are those we feel contribut e most to understanding the potential for change in the current health economy. Structure of the Report The report has six m ain sections, with secti ons 2-4 covering the m ain survey results in a series of summ ary graphs and comm entaries . Note that each graph ind icates the to tal number of patients relevant to that particular analysis. 1. The principles and m ethodology underlyi ng the project.

Discussion and conclusions Principles u nderlying the project One of the key underlying concepts of this project has been to support the developm ent of a strategy that will improve the appropriate flow of patients through the system of care within the health and social care econom y of Lincolnshire. The assum ption is that dem and in any one part of the system of flow is dependent on the ability of the capacity tw o stages o r more 'upstream ' to handle the dem and that is presented to it. Reducing delays throughout th e system , so that work can flow at the appropriate tim e, is crucial in optim ising the use of resources. Similarly, if there are deem ed to be problem s within the cu rrent system s, one solution is to widen the scope of the system s to include further stages, and create innovative solutions to those problem s. For example, perceived problem s at the adm ission to a hospital m ay be m ore efficiently m anaged through preventative and chronic disease manage ment programm es in the commun ity that prevent p eople arriving unnecessarily at the ho spital 'front do or' in the f irst place. Figure 1.1 below illustrates these issues ge nerally at key points on the patient flow system . Relative to each elem ent of this flow are aspects and issues that may affect its perform ance. For exam ple, discharge pla nning issues m ight include whether or not there is a good discharge pla nning culture, or technical factors to do with capacity which m ight be delaying discharge processes. Below each of those asp ects, in turn, are potential m anagem ent action an d decis ion areas that m ight be considered. The key to m aking all of this work is in form ation: knowing what is going on at any one tim e directly im pacts on the ab ility f or managing the entire process. S ome aspects of the system are better provided with data than others and a key elem ent of this project has been to obtain, by means of a m ajor bed usage survey, relevant data on the use of beds and the characteristics of patient s using them which can then be used to inform issues about the scope of capac ity and future service requirem ents. With this f ocus, the und erlying prin ciples of this project have included: Adopting a whole system s methodology Exam ining the balance b etween capacity and d emand at all s tages of the care pathways Involving m anagers, clinicians and pr actitioners from all the stakeholder organisations. Undertaking the pro ject in a m anner that f acilitate s the pra ctical implementation of its outcom es.

The involvem ent of clinicians and o ther care prof essional staff took place throughout the process of the proj ect itself including: defining the survey questionnaire to reflect more closely local circu mstances and data definitions; undertaking the su rvey; and in being involved in the inte rpretation o f the results. Consultation and preparation took place in September and October followed by the survey itself, which took place on a singl e day (2 9 Nove mber 2006). This included : medical and orthopaedic adult inpatients at the four ULH sites; OPMH beds LPT sites; e-spec ific location s ee community hospita l site s and plac ements within el even care hom es across the county. Non- orthopaed ic surgica l, pae diatric, m aternity and acute psychiatric patients and day cases were excluded from the survey. The overall coverage of the survey w as close to 100% of the patients targeted. To date we have not been able to com pare with a def initive list com piled f rom the hospita l Patient Administration S ystem s of pa tients in hospital during that day. However we have had access to an extrac t of all discharges and deaths of patients bef ore 23 Decem ber 2006 of patients adm itted on or befo re the surv ey date (s ignificant num bers of patients rem ained in hospital at that point), and there is a good m atch to survey data, once corrections for m is-recording of IDs, and variable use of IDs is taken into account. Figure 1.2 summ arises the locations of patient s surveyed and the num bers of available beds reported (for m ore deta il see ap pendix I). In most cases any larg e difference can be explained in term s of particular oper ational issues on the day. For example, the Gainsborough hospital ward was not as full as expected due to re cent ward renovation work having reduced its capacity in the da ys before the survey. At Lincoln County hospital, one ward was closed to new admi ssions in the days immediately prior to the survey which, in turn, accounted for its low occupancy on the survey day. One care ho me with four interm ediate ca re hom e places ('Cedars' at Bourne) was omitted f rom the surve y on the day due to pres sure of time on the surve yors as a res ult of large distances to trav el and traffic congestion.

Origina lly developed in the USA, it has been adapte d for use in the UK and Europe and been validated and found to be reliable tool [1, 2]. The Balance of Care Group has experience o ver recent y ears of em ploying it in several loca l health econo mies across the UK. The AEP enables an analysis of the reasons for admission as well as thos e for continuing stay in an acu te care setting agains t a range of crite ria for judg ing the appropriateness of that setting for individua l patients in term s of the acuity of their condition or treatm ent requirem ents (see append ix II). The Balan ce of Care Group 8For the acu te hospital su rvey sites, th e AE P for med the co re of the survey for m around which other questions sought inform ation about potential alternative care settings - w hether they we re currently available or not . This was a cruc ial assum ption as the survey was being used to identify potential demand for alte rnative s ervices - irrespective of whether or not th ey cu rrently ex ist. Of particula r interes t in this survey were alterna tives f or peo ple with de mentia. Definitions of the alternatives specified on the survey f orm are provided in appendix III. The AEP was also used o n the survey form for the OPMH inpatien t sites bu t with an important difference in its application to acu te sites. In the latter, surveyors did not identif y alternative ca re settings if patients m et either adm ission and/or day of care criteria. In the OPMH settings, however, su rveyors reco rded AEP criteria for patien ts but, irrespective of whether or not they were found, they were asked to identify relev ant alternatives to admission and day of care for every p atient. The AEP was being used in these locations to identify any substantial m edical conditions alongside mental state conditions. The AEP wa s not em ployed in the survey of the comm unity hospital and care hom e locations be cause it does not iden tify patien ts purposes or sub-acute care (the usual for m of care provided in these settings). Building on work that the Balance of Care Group has undertaken in other survey sites, a modified version of the survey f orm - which exp licitly recog nised th is type of patient - was em ployed for these sites. This questionnaire still asked about the type of care for which the pa tient had been a dmitted (and whether th is could have taken place in an altern ative s etting), and whether car e the patient was currently receiving m ight be car ried o ut in an a lternative settin g. As there were no equivalent benchm ark AEP criteria, the potential for alternatives was sought for all patients irr espective of admission or continuing care reasons. Apart from these variations on the use of the AEP instrum ent, all o ther da ta item s collected on all su rvey form variation s were iden tical. This m eant that, where relevant, analyses could be carried out acros s the entire survey population, as well as for the resp ective acute, community and OPMH sectors. As well as identif ying p atients that were poten tially su itable for alte rnative care settings, the survey al so recorded data on: when - and by what ref erral route - the patient w as adm itted to the hospita l and who adm itted them . reasons f or admission; co -morbidities ; and any in dividua l risk factors (f or exam ple, whether the pa tient was on a multiple dr ug therapy o r lived alone ). mental state (dem entia; confusion; psyc hoses; anxiety/ depression; substance misuse) whether the patient had a discharge plan and any reasons which appeared to be contributing to delays to their care pro cess ( irrespectiv e of the patien t bein g medically fit for discharge at the tim e of the survey). Key m essages from these data are presen ted in sections 2-5 of this report. Following the survey and initial analyses of the data, a results interpretation workshop was held at which initial survey findings were presented to surveyors for discussion and clarification of any issues that had arisen in c ompleting th e survey f orms. The Balan ce of Care Group 9Comm ents from these sessions and other f eedback supplied by surveyors on the day are reported in appendix IV. Surveyor tr aining The involvem ent of loca l care professionals in the survey process was crucial to its success. Som e 67 care professional staff undertook the survey; com ing from both acute and community backgrounds, and spanning m edical, nursing and therapy professions (see appendix V). All surveyor s underwent specific pre-survey training, which was fundam ental to the conduct of the survey. It covered the survey aim s and explained in detail the survey form and how it was to be com pleted. Several elem ents of the data to be reco rded - particularly those related to the interpretation of whether the patient m et AEP criter ia - re lied on the surv eyor's professional ability to abstract relevant data from the patient notes and, w here appropriate, judge the potential for appropria te alternative care settings based not on their knowledge of existing services or facilities, but on alternative care processes . Thus 'non-acute bed' as an alternative to acute care could signif y a range of potential locations (eg. community hospital or care home) while 'specialist nurse' could be specified in relation to the diagnosis of the patient (e g. specialist in COPD or diabetes). All of these co uld be assum ed to be available alternatives; sur veyors were asked to ignore any existing resource constr aints when identif ying alternatives as the aim was to identif y potential demand for future service configurations and investm ent. Wherever p ossible surv eyors were allocated to areas they did not norm ally work in (for exam ple, to a com munity hospital when they norm ally worked on an acute ward or, if they r emained on their usua l hospita l site, a different ward area). T his enabled a more objective perspective to be taken of the inf ormation available f rom the patient notes. Several surveyors also took pa rt in subsequent 'results interpretation' workshops which provided a m eans of cross-checking how they had interpreted the survey questions on the day. Data and confidentia lity issues Approval was sought and obtained from the Ca ldicott Guardians responsible in each of the participating organisations. Data fo r the survey were ab stracted fro m each patient's m edical, nursing and therapy notes. All patient-specific data were anonym ised prior to entry onto a structured 'Access' database by Balance of Care Group analysts. All surveyors and project team members si gned a data confidentiality form designed for the project. The survey data were linked to the hosp ital and community PA S systems through the patient's hospital num ber. This enabled da ta on patients' PCT to be obtained and, a few weeks after the su rvey, key data to be added on date a nd destination of discharge, if this had subsequently occurred. Th e reason for this follow-up was to obtain inform ation on lengths of stay of the survey cohort and to 'fine- tune' the implications for developing potential alternat ive c are cap acity estim ates. BERS OF PE OPLE WITH DEMENTIA IN HOSPITAL BEDS Each figure in this sectio n is accom panied by a more detailed commentary, but key p oints are: The average age of all patients surveyed was 76, and 83% were aged over 65. OPMH patients tended to be in the younger 65+ age bands, with very few aged over 85. (figs 2.1, 2.2) Various risk factors m ay predispose patie nts to hospital adm ission and continuing stay. Many acute and interm ediate ca re patients h ave m ultiple com orbidities. However, this tended not to be the ca se for OPMH patients, who also had few mobility p roblems (fig 2.3). The proportions of all acute patients falling within AEP criteria were s imilar to the levels found in other UK studies: 16% were outside AEP adm ission criteria, and 49% day of care criteria (fig 2.4) For OPMH patients use of the AEP protocol in dicated that most are 'm edically fit', so that the focus of their treatm ent can be th eir m ental and cognitiv e function (fig 2.4). 111 of the 863 surveyed (13%) were identified as having dementia. Further review of the survey data identified a further 30 patie nts at 'high risk' of dementia, although the diagnosis had not been identified in the cas e notes. Many dem entia patients in acute hospital beds had behavioural problem s requi ring prom pting or constant supervision (figs 2.5 - 2.9). Many patients with dem entia have other co-m orbidities and most of these patients are in acute care rather than OPMH settings (figs 2.10, 2.11). There is a range of m ental health asse ssments used for patients across the county. However it appears that som e assessm ents may not be re adily identif iable f rom hospital case notes, with im plications for care delivery. (figs 2.12 - 2.15). The Balanc e of Care Group 11 Figure 2.1 Age of Patients Surveyed ( N= 863) Under 65 17% 65 to 74 20% 75 to 84 33%85 & over 30%NK 0% Over 80% of all the patients surveyed were ag ed 65 years and older, and 63% of them were over 75 years old. The average age was 76. This age profile, weighted towards older age groups, is to be expected given the wards included in the survey. O lder pa tients are m ore lik ely to be ad mitted to hospita l, and h ave longer lengths of stay. The com bined effect of this is that even in acute hospitals the m ajority of patients in beds ar e in older age groups. The Balanc e of Care Group 12 Figure 2.2 Age Distribution of Patients by T ype of Bed (N=860) 050100150200250 Under 65 65 to 74 75 to 84 85 & overNo of patients A -acute B intermediate c are C - OPMH The distribution by age varies acr oss type of bed provision. As m ight be expected patients in interm ediate settings tend to be older, with nearly half aged 85 or above. Of particular note however are the ages of patie nts in OPMH units, th e major ity of whom are under 85: this is an indicator of the w ay these specialist units focus on working with patients at a relatively early stage of their condition, a nd patients are expected to move on to other forms of care in due course. The Balanc e of Care Group 13 Figure 2.3 Risk Fact ors by T ype of Provision 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% Multiple Drugs 4+ Incapacity of Carer Housing Lives Mobility Aged 80/+ 2/+ Comorbidity 1/+ Mental State% of all 'Risk factors' are d efined as circum stances wh ich are likely to have a bearing on adm ission and discharge processes for patients. These in clude the patien t's age, co-morbidities and number of m edications they ar e on, but also wider social ci rcum stances which m ay affect their ability to liv e succe ssfully in th e community, f or exam ple whethe r they live alo ne, have poor m obility, or have a carer who is curren tly incapacitated. Presence of these facto rs - and an individual patient m ay have m ore than one of these - m ay increase the propensity to adm it a patient in order to m inimise their risk, or m ake it m ore complex and often, therefore, slower to organise discharge arrangem ents. Many patients are on four or m ore medications - this is not unusual and reflects current practice in modern drug therapie s to treat different co-m orbidi ties su ch as heart failure. Incapacity o f carer (whether due to m edical ci rcumstances or stres s-related/ unable to cope) was not particularly significant, but proportiona lly m ore so for OPMH patients (who are also less likely to be living alone). Overall 59% of patients had 2 or m ore com orbidities, indicating the presence of long term conditions and possible issues of frailty. There are relatively fewe r patients with two or more co-m orbidities in th e OPMH setting s - indica tive of fewer 'f rail' patients and m ore focus on treating m ental rather than physical conditions. Less than 10 % of these p atients have mobility problem s.

There are tw o sets of cr iteria : one se t rela te retrospectiv ely to the patient's adm ission; the other to the condi tion and care requirem ents on the day of the survey. The percentages of ULH patients falling within e ither set of criter ia is no t atyp ical w hen compared to other UK studies covering m edical and orthopaedic beds: 16% were outside AEP adm ission criteria and 49% day of care criteria. Note that this does not imply that 16% of all admissions would be out side AEP criteria: within a po int prevalence study th e patients surveyed will be disproportio nately those with longer s tays, and as sho wn above they will te nd to be frailer older peop le with com plex health and s ocial care n eeds, and m ore like ly to b e adm itted outside AEP criter ia. In addition 4 9 patien ts (7%) were ad mitted to ULH acute sites within A EP crite ria, but the only identifiable reason wa s intravenous therapy. The application of acute care cr iteria to the OPM H patients was to es tablis h the lev el of medical needs over and above any needs associat ed with the patient's mental condition. The figures indicate m uch smaller proportions of pa tients m eeting eithe r set of acute c are criteria - in the m ajority of cases the AEP cr iteria selected related to the pa tient's consciousness or confusional states, suggesting that very few patients had 'm ainstream ' medical conditions. This ref lects the loc al care model which f ocuses on providing a m ental health care and not prim arily treatm ent for other acute conditions.

W hilst acute confusional st ('delirium commonplace in patien ts adm itted with infectio ns or other to xic conditio ns, m ost will stabilise within a few days of adm ission, thus continued conf usion m ay be an indicator of dementia. The m ajority of surveyors did not ha ve a m ental health training background and tended to be conservative in recording these assessm ents; looking for a clear record of dementia in the notes rather than attemp ting to piece together that d iagnosis from circum stantial evid ence (for exam ple, based on me dication or co-m orbidities). This approach was adopted throughout, but we have subseque ntly reviewed the data on confusion to identify patients at 'high risk' of having dem entia (see figure 2.15). Typically it is dif ficult identif y the p resenc e of anxiety and depression from inpatient case notes and it is lik ely that the re corded levels und erstate the actual p revalence. As this is outside the immediate concerns of this project, we have not inve stigated this issue further.

The greatest num ber of identified patients with dementia are in acute hos pital settings (65 out of 111). A further 40 patients out of the 75 in OPMH were diagnosed with dem entia. Only 6 patie nts with de mentia were identif ied in intermediate care settin gs, five of these in community hospitals, the other in a care hom e. Although there is no form al bar to access to intermediate care f or peo ple with de mentia, in practice the emphasis on relatively rapid access to reh abilitation services, or a period of recuperation, m ilitates again st more complex dementia patien ts with multiple co morbidities. However 23 out of 105 interm ediate care patient s were assessed as confused, indicating the possibility that som e might have undiagnosed dementia, or the diagnosis had been withheld to avoid prejudicing access to rehabilitation.

Prompting Constant Supervision Behavioural problem s identified here reflect care or supervision requirements in acute hospital (UL H) settings only. As m ight be expe cted, a greater proportion of de mentia patients require prompting in undertaking tasks or cons tant supervision. The latter is particularly required when the patient is physically mobile and has a tendency to wander. Of interest are the num bers of patients with conf usion who re quire supervision or prompting. The num bers are very sim ilar to those for dem entia. Note that th ere a re also patien ts identified as requiring prompting or constant supervision who do not have an identified m ental health cond ition - these leve ls of nursing s upervis ion) or people re covering from , for exam ple, strokes. Equivalent counts of behavioural issues in interm ediate care and OPMH s ettings follow (figures 2.8 and 2.9). For interm ediate care a m ajority of the patients with confusion were also id entified as requ iring additional supervision.

A range of different scores appear to be used, with the Min i Mental Test (MMT) and Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT/ Hodkinson) being the m ost comm on. Altogether an assessm ent was only identified fo r 46 out of the 111 patients with dem entia, and it is likely that som e assessm ents were not identified because either a standard profor ma was not used (the key findings being incorporat ed in other m edical notes) or the profor ma was not held with the m ain notes this m ay be a factor in the lack of Easycare assessm ents found.

Here the lack of docum entation found - even in hospitals such as the Pilgri m known to have a m ore thorough approach to assessm ent - suggests that the organization of notes could be impr oved to ensure that generalis t staff can readily access m ental assessm ent. It is lik ely th at sim ilar iss ues apply to the use of the Single Assessm ent Process (SAP, implemented through E asyCare). The Balanc e of Care Group 23 Figure 2.14 Asse ssed risk of ' confusion' patie nts hav ing de mentia (N=119) 0102030405060 High Medium Low Assessed risk of dem entiaNo of patients OPMH IC acute The incom plete nature of the m ental assessm ent docum entation, coupled with som e of the data regarding behavioural charac teristic of patients indicated th at there m ight be substantial numbers of patien ts with dem entia that had not been diagno sed, or the d iagnosis om itted from hospital notes. In th e latter case there wa s some anecdotal eviden ce th at diagno ses were not recorded if this was likely to prej udice the patient's subsequent placem ent. We therefore reviewed all 119 pa tients with m ention of confusi on, and classified them into groups at high, m edium and low risk of having dem entia. This was based on: Age MH Assessm ent scores Potentially linked com orbidit ies eg vascular disease Confusion on adm ission that was st ill present on the day of care Whether the confusion could have a toxic cause eg UTI Altogethe r 30 patien ts fell into the 'h igh risk ' category: m ost of these patients would be given a dem entia diagnosis on the basis of the av ailable data alone. It is probable that som e of the m edium risk group would also be di agnosed with at least m oderate dem entia.

This inc luded thre e in Bunkers Hill and two in othe r care hom es with the rem ainder in comm unity hospitals including four in Skegness. Curiously, all except one of the interm ediate care patients had only a single com orbidity, with a range of different conditions reported. Th is suggests that patien ts in the high risk group m ay be cleared for interm ediate care referral if it is felt that wide r frailty issues are not too unm anageable. The Balanc e of Care Group 25 SECTION 3 ADMISSION ROUTES FOR PEOPLE WITH DEM ENTIA Key points are: Referral routes into acute beds for dem entia patients ar e sim ilar to those f or patients without dem entia or m ental health issues (fig 3.1). For patients with a m ental hea lth iss ue, acute ad missions are driven by m edical rather than those mental health n eeds, although there m ay be som e adm issions of patients with dem entia which m ight be avoidable if the dem entia diagnosis was known (figs 3.2, 3.3). Although the num bers are sm all, surveyor s suggested a wide range of potential alternative care settings to acute ad mission for dem entia patients. (fig 3.4). The Balanc e of Care Group 26 Figure 3.1 Source of Referral for Patients with Dem entia - Acute (N=65) Referral by GP 18% Seen by GP 17% 999 43%Self 2%Other Hospital 2%Other/nk 18% Source of Referral for Patients with Dementia - OPMH (N=40) Referral by GP 32% Seen by G P 5% Other Hospital 15%CMHT 18%Crisis Team 8%Other/nk 22% Referral patterns for acute hospital adm ission were sim ilar to those f or patients in Lincolnshire without dem entia or mental health issues. One thir d of patients were referred in by their GP, and nearly h alf were ad mitted following a 999 call (with no evidence of GP involvem ent). W ithin the OPMH sector there was a more even split am ong several principal referra l routes: GPs, oth er hospitals (usually acute), comm unity m ental h ealth and crisis team s. Community Psychiatric Nurses and soci al workers were included in the 'other' group. The Balanc e of Care Group 27 Figure 3.2 AEP on A dmission of Misuse OtherNo of patients within AEP outside AEP For acute ho spita l (ULH) patients, th e majority of patients - across all typ es of mental condition - fell within the adm ission criteria for acute care. F or dem entia 11 out of 65 patien ts (17 %) were ad mitted outside AEP crite ria, on ly slig htly high er than the equ ivalent figure for all acute inpatients surv eyed (16%) as shown in figure 2.4. The significance of this is that acute adm issions appear to be driven by m edical (rather than mental health) reason s. This reflects a typic al characteristic of these patients as being elderly, and often frail with several co-m orbidities. The Balanc e of Care Group 28 Figure 3.3 Admission criteria of ULH patients with dementia (N=65) 0510152025 01 23 45 Number of comorbiditiesNo of patients other A1 outside AEP One f eature that d ifferentia tes th e dementia admissions from others is the extent of admissions that re late to AEP criter ion A1 ('sudden onset of unconsciousness or disorientatio n'). As can been seen ab ove this reason for adm ission par ticularly app lies for patien ts with no or few com orbidities (though nu mbers are s mall), and in these cases it m ay be that som e of these adm issions could al so be avoided if it was known patients had dementia but not other conditions. Altogether 14 acute adm issions were identified as m eeting criterion A1, though we cannot tell if a ny other criteria m ight have applied. For the 17 acute patients with confusion identifie d as being 'high risk' for dem entia a sim ilar pattern could be observed. Only 2 of the 17 'h igh risk' p atients ( 12%) were urther 7 ( 41%) were a dmitted with the A1 char acteristic.

In this g raph the focus is on alte rnative s to ad mission f or dementia patien ts in a ll care s ettings . For acute patients only, alternatives were not sought if the patient was within AEP adm ission cr iteria (since acute hospital admission is thereby identified as the preferred option). T he options shown are surveyors' 'f irst option s' if they specified m ore than on e for each patient (which was perm issible). With the caveat th at we are look ing at sm all num bers, a striking feature of this graph is the wide range of potential alternat ive care settings suggested - including many which were not 'mental health spec ific' options. Fur therm ore the range is wide for all types of care setting where the pa tient is cu rrently situa ted. Five patients m ight have avoided ad mission to an acute o r OPMH f acility if a genera list 'Non-acute bed with therapy' (eg community hos pital) had been available to them , and a further 7 m ight have been able to go to a more specialist non-acute bed. S ix patients in OPMH beds needed specialist EMI care hom e beds plus just a single acute inpatient. There were a num ber of hom e based alternativ es to adm ission identified, but only in a few cases for acute inpatien ts. For only tw o patients in care hom es 'carer respite' was iden tified, but it a ppears th at this is in effect what the adm issions had been designed to achieve. Oth erwise pa tient characteristics, in particular the presence of an acute or sub- acute medical condition, indicated a need for admission to bed based care, though not necessarily an acute bed. The Balanc e of Care Group 30 SECTION 4 REASONS FOR CONTINUED STAY IN HOSPI TAL Key points are: Dementia patients are more likely to be out side 'day of care' AEP criteria in acute settings than other patients without dem entia (fig 4.1) Just as they did for alternatives to adm ission, surveyors identified a wide range of potential alternative care settings fo r patien ts with dem entia who were outside day of care AEP criteria in acute beds, and also for patients currently in OPMH beds. A major issue appears to b e arranging access to a wide range of services that m ay only have lim ited experience of caring for people with dem entia (figs 4.2, 4.3). There appeared to be relatively little m ovement on to non-acu te setting s specializing in dem entia care, providing either ther apeutic or continuing care (fig 4.3) Looking specifically at o rthopaed ic patients with dem entia; most had been adm itted following a fracture o r fall; none had been admitted for elective procedures. Lengths of stay were considerably higher than for equivalent traum a patients without dem entia (fig 4.4). The Balanc e of Care Group 31 Figure 4.1 AEP on D ay of Care of Acute Inpatients with Mental/Cogni tive Issues ( N=217) 0102030405060708090100 Dementia Misuse OtherNo of patients within AEP outside AEP When it com es to an exam ination of AEP status on the day of care, the dem entia group differ significantly from other patients, and from those with m ental or cognitive issues. Altogether 44 out of the 65 acute patients w ith dem entia were outside AE P criteria (68%) compared to an averag e figure acro ss medical and orthopaedic wards of 49% (figure 2.4).

Note that surveyors would have incl uded those patients soon to be discharged not knowing of course exactly when they m ight have been discharged. These data were obtained two weeks after the su rvey from the local info rmation system s which gave a discharge date and destination of surveyed patients (if this had happened). The graph shows alternatives considered for patients outsi de AEP criter ia in the ULH hospitals only (alternatives were identified for 43 of the 44 outside AEP criteria). A 'quick discharge' is one within a week of the survey or two week s, if the alternative is bed-based. The rem aining patients are therefore those for whom the preferred di scharge option (or any other) has not been m ade available. There is a range of alternativ es identified, m ostly involving access to m ainstream services, none in great volum e. This suggests that one of the m ajor issues for dementia patients is arrang ing th e acces s to a wide range of services that m ay only have lim ited experience of caring for people with dem entia. There are however two patient gr oups requiring more specialised services, and in neither case were any of these patients discharged over the two week follow up period. The larger requirem ent, which applied to 11 of the dem entia patients, is for the 'non-acute bed with MH therapy' ie a bed based servic e providing rehabilitation, where th e staff are trained to work with dem entia patients. The other group involve d 5 patients requiring continuing care in an EMI care ho me.

As for acute patients there was a group requi ring EMI continuing care, plus the m ore specialized therapy option with MH trained staff. In the latter case it m ay be that this s ervice is already being delivered with in the OPMH environm ent, certa inly this would be possible. The Balanc e of Care Group 34 Figure 4.4 Numbers of Patients on O rthopaedi c Wards by M ental Category ( N=130) Dementia, 17 Confusion, 19 Substance Misuse, 3 No mental /cognitive issue, 91 In describing the acute hospital population w ith dem entia, we have grouped together the medical and orthopaedic patients. Prevalence of dem entia on the orthopaedic wards is sim ilar to medical, with 17 out of the130 patients (13% ) identified with dem entia diagnoses, and a further 19 (15%) with in dications of confusion. None of the patients with dem entia or confus ion were undergoing elective procedures - m ost were adm itted f ollowing falls and f ractures. As f or other p atients with de mentia the m ajority were outside AEP criteria on the day of care, and there was a r ange of alternative s iden tified to expedite discharge, which are incl uded in the totals shown in figure 4.2. Using the outcom e data on discharges extrac ted from the hospital PAS system s, we ha ve calcu lated th at the averag e length of s tay for th e patients with dem entia who were discharged by 23 December 2006 (13 out of the 17) was 24.3 days. The com parable figure for non- elective patients without dem entia diagnoses was 16.9 days. The Balanc e of Care Group 35 SECTION 5 COM PARISON WITH SIMILAR S URVEYS Previous surveys undertaken by the B alance of Care Group have indicated the extent to which hospital beds m ay be disproportionately occupied by patients with dem entia, and it is of interest to com pare the headline figures of this more focussed survey with those ob tained elsewhere. Earlier surveys using the AEP protocol tend ed to be focussed on the developm ent of interm ediate care (IC) pr ovision, and it is on ly in more recen t surveys, with the focus more on frailty an d long term conditions that we ha ve explicitly so ught information on dem entia diagnoses. We have been able to extract com parable data from survey s in hospitals across: Cambridgeshire (2003) Oxfordshire (2003) North Ham pshire (2004) Sheffield (2004) Of these only the North Ham pshire exercis e included the OPMH service, and hence h ad a particular focus on dem entia and other m ental state data. The Oxfordshire survey was undertaken in parallel with a separate OPMH survey and there was som e focus, especially across its geratology (elderly m edicine) service, on m eeting th e needs of frail older people with dem entia. Generally com parisons across health econom ies are difficult for a variety of reasons: the catchm ents are not known; bed usage by patients with dem entia will depend on length of stay as well as adm ission avoidance; the deploym ent of beds to m eet elderly m edicine needs m ay involve com munity hospitals and care hom es; and som e beds in acute hospitals m ay be deliberately allocated for non-acute purposes. The Balanc e of Care Group 36 Figure 5.1 Per centage of medical and orthopaedi c patients with dem entia 0%2%4%6%8%10%12%14% LincolnshireCambridge North Hampshire Oxford Sheffieldintermediate care acute All the surveys above included th e available designated interm ediate care beds together with medical and orthopaedic beds in acute hospitals, so we have looked at prevalence of dementia across all these beds, plus AEP com pliance in the acute hospital beds only. Figure 5.1 shows the percentage of all these patients with an identified dem entia diagnosis. O nly North Ham pshire shows a higher count than Linc olnshire, and this was attributable to the numbers within the com munity hosp itals. Oxf ordshire had sim ilar bed numbers but made much m ore use of commun ity hospitals m anaged by, wh at is now, a single PCT. Cambridge and Sheffield both show a lower count, and we s uspect that th is is affected by the lack of focus on dem entia in these ex ercis es and that diagnoses in th e notes m ay have been missed. W ith these ex ercises taking place 2 - 3 y ears ago we also note that there were fewer structured as sessm ents, such as SAP, com pleted then.

With regard to AEP crite ria on adm ission the re is wide variability that will be af fected by the interpretation of the 'A1' criterion ('sudden ons et of unconsciousness or disorientation'), but also by overall length of stay a nd the extent of non-acute prov ision with in otherwise ac ute hospita ls (this was espec ially the c ase in Oxf ord). In all cases the num ber of patients with dem entia outside AEP criteria on the day of care is very high, reflecting the difficu lty encountered across the coun try in discharge of such patien ts from acute f acilities. The Balanc e of Care Group 38 SECTION 6: DISCUSS ION AND CONCLUSIONS This project has adopted an established m ethodology for reviewing hospital bed utilisation, and extended it to provide m ore detailed insigh ts into the usage of beds by people with dementia. In order to identify these patients w e have n eeded to survey com prehensively bed u sage in specialties where patients with dem entia are likely to be found ie m edical and orthopaedic, and interm ediate care beds, in addition to sp ecialist OPMH beds. Fi ndings across the whole survey population for Lincolnshire have not b een reported other than where they provide a useful com parator for dem entia-specific count s. We are, however, providing m ore detailed counts to the participating Linc olnshire organisations, which m ay be of value in considering whole system issues relating to care practice and capacity ac ross the wider local health and social care econom y. We noted in section 2 that the proportions of all patients outside AEP criteria were sim ilar to those encountered in other exercises, and there will also be similarities in the potential alternatives to hospi tal provision, though of course levels here will be dep endent on the curren t serv ice configuration. In previous Balance of Care surveys we ha ve not usually sought such specific data on dementia, and som e of the com parability issues with pr evious surveys wer e discuss ed in section 5. In the light of this som e of the findi ngs have been surprising, or at least were not predicted. T he implications of the findings require further discu ssion between all the Lincolnsh ire agencie s, not least to es tablish the care m odels that need to be put in place if service deliv ery and asso ciated capacity is to change. This concluding section aim s to draw toge ther the various findings em erging from the survey, and highlight issues that will need at tention as shared plan s are put together. We consider in order: Num bers of hospital patients with dem entia Quality of current p rovision Alterna tives to adm ission Earlier disch arge from hospita l Numbers of Patients with Dementia Bed usage by patients with dem entia is high, a nd more patients are to be found in m edical and orthopaedic wards than in specialist OPMH units. Altogether dem entia diagnoses were identified for 111 out of the 863 patients surv eyed (13%). Across m edical and orthopaedic patients in acute hospitals, 65 out of 667 patients (10%) had a dem entia diagnosis. This high bed usage reflects the extent to which m any people with dem entia have comorbidities which put them at risk of hospital adm ission. Once adm itted the sorts o f difficulties associated with arranging discha rge of older peop le are com pounded by th e presence of cognitive problem s. One issue we have explored is the extent to which diagnosis m ay be withheld to increase the possibilities of patients being able to move on to more appropri ate care settings. Although in principle som e of the interm ediate care provisi on could cater f or patients with dem entia (c are homes with appropriate regist ration, and community hospitals ) only 6 patients out of 121 surveyed in interm ediate car e placem ents (5 %) had dem entia diagnoses. T o explore th e The Balanc e of Care Group 39 possible extent of undiagnosed cases, we revi ewed all 119 patients for whom issues of confusion had been raised, and identified a further 30 patients at 'high risk' of de mentia, whose characteristics appeared consistent with a diagnosis of dem entia. Interestingly these patien ts included 10 in interm ediate care s ettings ; half of these in ca re hom e place ments. With 17 'high risk' patients in acute hospita l, the total inpatient population known, or likely to have, dem entia rises to 82 out of 667 patie nts (12%). Sim ilarly the interm ediate care setting could have 16 patients with dem entia out of 121 (13%), although the level of comorbidity for these patients appears low. Probabl y this also underestim ates the true level of dementia in this hospital populat ion, as m any of the 55 patients at 'm oderate risk' are also likely to have dem entia. Whether or not the high risk patients are in cluded , the lev el of dem entia identif ied is comparable to or higher than that recorded in previous Balance of Care surveys in other parts of the country. W e do not believe th at this n ecessarily im plies higher levels of need, nor greater dependence on hospital serv ices, since it could be that the level of mental health assessm ent is higher in L incolnshire than th e other locations, and we were in any case particularly looking for these m easures. Quality o f Services Although not within the term s of refe rence of this project the survey did provide som e indicators of the quality of car e for patien ts with dem entia. The clin ical member of the Balance of Care te am was struck by the high standard of care being delivered within the OP MH units, and the apparently high m orale of staff working there, which we had not encountered in other surv eys. In discussion we felt that in part this resulted from the clear policy on casem ix, with patien ts selected at earlier stages of the condition and with relatively few comorbidities, for which the aim of the inpatient stay was to orientate the patient for successful return home for the long term . Thus the units d id not becom e dom inated by patients requiri ng rehabilitation or continuing care. Patien ts with a range of com orbidities tended to be found on m edical and orthopaed ic wards. Given the medical problem s this m ay be a suitab le way to meet the patient's needs provided that the special requirements of dem entia are addressed. On this we have noted the apparently incom plete and inconsistent use of mental state as sessm ents. Nevertheless we did form the impression that the use of assessm ents was higher than in hospital populations we have surveyed in the past, and to som e extent the gaps m ay be attributable to a lack of integration of assessm ents undertaken el sewhere into the hospital casenotes. Nevertheless the m ajority of patients with dem entia in the acute hospital setting did not have acute m edical needs in term s of AEP criteria, but in m any cases neither were they able to move on to more approp riate settings. One indica tor of this ca n be taken f rom the expe rienc e on orthopaedic wards, w here the average length of stay of dem entia patie nts surveyed (all of them non-elective) was over 24 days, com pared to under 17 days for other non-elective orthopaedic inpatients. Alterna tives to Admissio n The extent of adm ission of patients with dem entia outside A EP criteria was sim ilar to that of other patients. Thus only a sm all number of altern ative approaches to ca re at this po int was identified, over half relating to som e alternative form of non-acute bed provision. The Balanc e of Care Group 40 In previous Balance of Care surveys the leve l of adm issions outside AE P criteria has been higher (though on a lower num ber of identifie d patients with dem entia). A possible difference here is the use of the 'A1' adm ission criterion: 'S udden onset of unconsciousness or disorientation (com a or unresponsiveness)' (f ull list of criteria at appendix II). A relatively high num ber of patients were iden tified in this g roup and, if adm itting phys icians had known of the dem entia diagnosis, an altern ative to adm ission m ight have been possible. Without knowing the diagnosis, it would be esse ntial to undertake a fu ll medical assessm ent because of the num ber of potential medical cau ses, such as in fection. Clearly ex tended mental health assessm ent and, just as im portant, easy availability of those assessm ents could affect adm ission decisions. Another factor affecting the adm ission process that has been sugge sted is the extent to which acute hospital patients have vascular dem entia rather than Alzheim er's Disease. W e note the large num ber of occurrences of diabetes, hypertension and hear t and cerebrovascular disease (figure 2.10) am ongst acute hospital adm issions, compared to the OPMH patients. LP T has subsequently reviewed the diagnostic m ix of OP MH inpatients and repo rted that over half those patients have vascular dem entia; we do not have equivalent figures f or patients presenting to acute hospitals, and it rem ains po ssible that people with dem entias developing alongsid e other m edical conditions are adm itted to acute hosp ital without being known to the specia list services. Earlier Dis charge from Hospital As seen in previous surveys, a high propor tion of acute patients with dem entia in Lincolnshire are outside AEP cr iteria. As for patients without dem entia, their needs are disparate, covering a range of hom e-based and bed-based services outside the acute setting. For m any it appears that the key is ensuring th at these patients do not get 'left behind', since it is always more stra ightforward for genera list services to de liver c are ne eds for the mainstream : there is potential here for support fro m in-reach specialist ment al health team s to ensure th e generic serv ices are available as required. The develop ment of the Community Mental Heal th Team , including an in-reach s ervice, in the Louth area provides one m odel of this in practice in the county. Only three dem entia patien ts were identified there on th e survey da te (5%), half the leve l seen at the o ther hospitals (although note that the numbers are sm all). Of these patients only one was outside AEP on the day, and was discharged hom e two days later. The precise reasons for these observations are unclear and m erit further, m ore detailed investigation. T he Louth approach aims to avoid adm ission where possible, including rapid review of patients presenting to the medical em ergency assessm ent unit, and to ensure patients are able to return hom e as soon as possible after an acu te medical or su rgical event. There rem ain however two specialis t services for which substantial dem and appear s to be unm et: non-acute, bed based therapy delivered by staff with relevant training in care of dem entia patients; and E MI continuing care (usually a care ho me with appropriate regi stration). Rem arkably, not one of the 16 acute hospital patients outside AEP crite ria on the day of care, and iden tified as suitable for one of these care options, had been discharged two weeks later. The shortage of continuing care placem ents for people with dem entia is recognised in Lincolnshire, and we understand there are propos als to m ake use of directly m anaged care homes for this purpose. However th ere is also a wish wherev er po ssible to increase the use of community based alternatives, although surveyor s only identified the pos sibility of a 'second choice' home based alternative in a s ingle cas e out of the 16 p atients identified for EMI continuing care across acute and OPMH beds. No te however that the bed usage survey did The Balanc e of Care Group 41 not include continu ing care placem ents, and furthe r review would be need ed to id entify if the curren t casemix and levels of use of contin uing care places w ould be requ ired if m ore community based services were available. The approach for therapy based beds, concerned with the reh abilita tion and return hom e of the patient, is also not strai ghtforward, as it requires a m ix of medical, therapeutic and mental health skills: in prin ciple the loc ation could be in any of the settings in cluded in this survey, and to identify the m ost appropriate appr oach requires further consideration by the Lincolnshire agencies of potential m odels of care that can best m eet these needs.

The Balanc Care Group 47 APPENDIX III: Survey form defini tions of alternative care settings Three different form s were used in the survey: form 'A' for the four ULH hospitals ; form 'B' for all non-acute sites (in cluding the community hospitals an d care hom e placem ent settings); and f orm C for the thr ee LPT sites f or OPMH patien ts. All form s had a sim ilar s tructure with surve yors asked to suggest where appropriate the potential f or care s ettings for patien ts in te rms of: a) alternatives which m ight have preven ted their cu rrent adm ission b) alternatives f or the care curren tly being rece ived on th e day of the survey ('day of care') In addition, surveyors w ere asked to identify: c) whether a patient was receiving any rehabil itation and, if so, what type (see below) d) if there were any identifiable delays to th e patient's treatm ent or discharge process. The tables below provide definitions of the pot ential care alte rnatives spe cified on the survey forms, and a classification of rehabilitation t ypes. All definitions were discussed in depth with surveyors during the training sessions. a) Alternative care settings to admission The specified alternatives to adm ission were id entical on all three su rvey forms types with the followin g exceptions : The 'non-acute bed + therapy' option was not given on fo rm B as it described the type of bed the patient w as currently in The addition of an 'acute bed' option on for m C.

This is ' low-level' rehabilitati on not requiring inputs from trained physiotherapy or occupational therapy (OT) sta ff. This type of patient m ay be recovering from a (relatively m inor) recen t illness or recu rrence of a chro nic conditio n and are unable to fully cope at hom e. They require only ' maintenance levels' of rehabilitation (which m ay involve lim ited inputs from physiotherapy or OT assistants) and, importantly, time to reco ver and r eturn to full hea lth. Restorative . This is m ore substantive rehabilita tion perform ed mainly by qualified OT and physiotherapy staff. This type of patient may be recovering from a more m ajor illness or recurrence of a chronic condi tion, or from a substantial acu te episode (such as a m ajor surgical or orthopaedic operati on). In this case the patient requires substantial inputs of therapy with the aim and exp ectation of restoring them to their previous levels of mobility and activ ity. Reconstructive . This is for patients requiring the substa ntial leve ls of rehabilita tion from qualif ied and spec ialist therapy staff and specialist m edical staff. This type of patien t is rec overing f rom a very sev ere cond ition (for example f rom a major stroke ) where they r equire sub stantia l levels of therapy to develop ne w skills su ch as walking following an am putation . They m ay or m ay not be expected to regain their previous levels of m obility and activity but hope to achieve a degree of independence. d) Delays to the discharge process Potential reasons affecting the discharge proce ss were set ou t for the surveyors to tick as many as applied for an individual patient (or to add any other reason not specified on the survey form).
