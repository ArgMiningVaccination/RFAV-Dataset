Moving Stories Workshops \"Moving Stories\" is a form of body-sourced improvisation involving authentic movement and spontaneous storytelling. Memories are stored in our kinesthetic memory. By freeing our bodies to express, we rediscover these experiences and describe them in poetry and stories. In these workshops, I guide participants in following their own intuition, and build group-trust as we learn to hold safe space for each others' explorations.
