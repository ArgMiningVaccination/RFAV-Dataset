Precautions There are limited data on the use of this drug in older people and renally or hepatically impaired patients. Fexofenadine should be administered with care in these special groups. Patient s with a history of, or ongoing cardiovascular disease should be warned that antihistamines as a medicine class are associated with tach ycardia and palpitations. Current evidence indicates that fexofenadine doses of 800mg as a single dose, up to 690mg twice daily for 1 month or 240mg once daily for a year show no clinically significant adverse reactions compared to placebo. Given a lack o f clinical data, fexofenadine should be avoided in pregnancy and breastfeeding mothers as after administration of terfenadine (the pro -drug for fexofenadine), fexofenadine was found to cross into human breast milk. Adverse effects Common side effects: headache, drowsiness, dizziness, nausea Uncommon side effects: fatigue Other side effects reported: hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnoea, flushing, systemic anaphylaxis); tachycardia, palpitati ons, diarrh oea, rash, urticaria , pruritis. Common Drug Interactions Fexofenadine does not undergo hepatic biotransformation and so does not interact with other medicinal products through hepatic mechanisms. Co-administration of fexofenadine with erythromycin or ketoconazole has been found to result in 2 -3 times increase in the plasma concentrations of fexofenadine, though this was not accompanied by any effects on the QT interval or any increase in adverse events compared to monotherapy. Administration of antacid co ntaining aluminium or magnesium hydroxide gels 15 minutes prior to fexofenadine caused a reduction in bioavailability, most likely due to binding in the gastro -intestinal tract. It is advisable to leave 2 hours between administration of fexofenadine hydrochloride and aluminium and magnesium hydroxide containing antacids.
