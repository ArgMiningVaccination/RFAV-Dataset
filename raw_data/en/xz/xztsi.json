Dr. Gary Ruelas (GR): Dr. Amen, you are going to be speak-ing at the Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference this December sponsoredby the Milton H. Erickson Founda- tion. As you know, Dr. Erickson was a pioneer in the field of mentalhealth and hypnosis, and he cham-pioned an integrated body-and-mindconcept. Could elaborate on how youview the body and mind, using inter-nal resources to help individualsovercome their difficulties? Dr. Daniel Amen (DA): I see the mind and body as totally intercon-nected. What a lot of people miss isthat when your brain works right, youmake better decisions for your body.When your brain is troubled from ahead injury, toxic exposure, havingADD, depression, an anxiety disorder,post-traumatic stress disorder, or toomuch stress in your life, it affects everysingle cell in your body in a negativeway. When you spend time optimizingand loving and caring for your brain,every other system in your body bene-fits. GR: So, there's a strong inte- grated connection that you have seenand experienced with patients thatyou have treated. DA: Absolutely. GR:You started your formal practice in psychiatry after complet-ing a residency in both adult andchild psychiatry in the early '80's,and finished your child fellowship in1987.

T elephone: (602) 956-6196 FAX: (602) 956-0519The Erickson Foundation NEWSLETTERThe Newsletter is Online! www.erickson-foundation.orgThis issue's theme celebrates the spiral nature of the Evolution of Psy- chotherapy. Looking through the per-spective of time, psychotherapyepisodically returns to its roots usingan expanded model and rationale ofwhat it feels constitutes healing andthriving for humans. Each re-visitationusually contains the same core patternseen from a different perspective.Human needs do not change, only ourunderstanding of them changes. Forexample, around 300 BCE, ancientGreeks with physical and emotionalailments would visit the healingshrines of Asclepius, the god of medi-cine and healing. These shrines wereusually in the hills overlooking theocean, far away from the crowdedcities. The treatments integrated phys-ical, nutritional, social, emotional, spir-itual, and community treatmentapproaches, all in a beautiful and rest-ful environment. Today we have a better understand- ing of how this multifaceted approachaffects us at the molecular level. Wehave come full circle with today's in-tegrative medical models. We nowknow more of how treating the personwith the condition is so much more ef-fective than just treating the conditionthat the person has. The focus of treat-ing a symptom or organ, be it the brainor the liver, is evolving into a focus ofhelping the whole person thrive. This Newsletter is dedicated the connection between this ancient Greekparadigm and to the 6th Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference's celebra- tion of the cross pollination of the heal-ing disciplines. In this issue, wepresent three Featured Interviewsrather than our usual single one. GaryRuelas interviews three of the most in-fluential leaders of the integrative med-ical approaches that speak health professionals; Chopra and AndrewWeil. Ruelas presented the same corequestions to each of these contempo-rary giants. The convergence and di-vergence of their responses isfascinating. In his In The Spirit of Psychother- apy column, John Lentz addresses the spiritual dimension within psychother-apy in his interview of Harville Hen-drix. Dave Norton presents a classicEricksonian intervention that respectsthe resources with the client in theCase Reports column. A brilliant adap- tation. Marilia Baker gives us a won-derful retrospective and prospectiveview of the Erickson Institutes in herIntroducing the Institutes article. It covers both the history and the pro-jected goals in a way that touches theheart of all of us involved with the In-stitutes. Speaking of touching the heart, at last Sharon McLaughlin, our managingeditor, was able to interview RoxannaErickson-Klein for our Contributor of Note . How she was able to avoid being acknowledged all this time for heramazing contributions to the Founda-tion is a mystery to me. An amazingwoman and a beautiful person. I amglad that Sharon persisted so long. The cross-pollination theme con- tinues both within and between the dis-ciplines in our media reviews. MariaEscalante de Smith presents both Psy- chotherapy Supervision: Theory, Re-search and Practice , edited by a family of psychologists: husband, Alan, wife,Kathy, and daughter, Tanya Hess, andpresents her own take on MichaelWhite's final gift to us all, Maps of Narrative Practice . Other book re- views include Albina Tamalonis'thoughtful review of How Can I For- give You? The Courage to Forgive, TheFreedom Not To by Janis Abrahms Spring and Michael Spring. John Fryk-man gives a comprehensive overviewof what he feels may be Michael F.Hoyt's best book yet, Brief Psy- chotherapies: Principles and Prac-tices. We entrusted Alex Pattakos' Prisoners of Our Thoughts: ViktorFrankl's Principles for DiscoveringMeaning in Life and Work to the capa- ble hands of Alexander and AnnellenM. Simpkins. They did a masterful jobof bringing the book to life. Given theirdecade and a half journey into the prac-tical applications of neuroscience, wethought it fitting for the Simpkins toalso review Louis Cozolino's book The Neuroscience of Human Relationships:Attachment and the Developing SocialBrain. Our CD and DVD reviews are equally impressive. The Simpkinsagain take on the task of reviewing thefull conference program interactiveCD-ROM of The Couples Conference; Love and Intimacy t h a tw a sh e l di nS a n Diego, California in May of this year.A great job. Because of his positive apprecia- tion of life and uplifting energy, weasked John Lentz to review a pair ofour most positive DVDs. He did a su-perb job in his reviews of Randall C.Wyatt's interview of Martin SeligmanPhD on Positive Psychology and Psy- chotherapy ; and Through Conflict to Connection; Imago Connects: TheSense of Love , which is based on the book Getting the Love You Want by Harville Hendrix. This is followed bythe Simpkins' intriguing review of NajiAbi-Hashem's Working with Arab Americans as part of the APA series on multicultural counseling. We finish with a trio of DVD re- views from the Brief Therapy Confer- ence in San Diego in December clinical demonstration by MichaelY apko, Hypnosis as a Context for Problem-Solving reviewed by Albina Tamalonis and a final review is pro-vided by John Lentz of Stephen Lank-ton's Using Hypnosis in a Brief Therapy Demonstration. All together, these interviews, arti- cles and reviews provide a comprehen-sive backdrop for this year's 6thEvolution of Psychotherapy Confer- ence and its pre and post-conferences.It promises to be one of the most mem-orable conferences of the decade.Please join us in Anaheim, California,December 8-14, 2009. Rick Landis, Ph.D. Orange, CaliforniaThe Milton H. Erickson Foundation Newsletter 4 VOL. 29, NO. 3 Dr. Harville Hendrix Ph.D. Interviewed by John D. Lentz D. Min. Dr . Harville Hendrix Ph.D. is co-founder of Imago Relationship Therapy along with his wife, Helen LaKelly Hunt. He is the author of \"Getting The Love You Want:A Guide for Couples\" and \"Keeping the Love You Find: A Personal Guide\" bothNew York Times best sellers. John Lentz: Dr. Hendrix: You are widely known as someone whose work promotes a spiritual experience. Was that your intent at the beginning or wasit a pleasant surprise? Harville Hendrix: It was not my intent at the beginning to promote a spiritual experience with couples. My early intent was to create a process that would helpcouples have the marriage they wanted, since they clearly did not want the marriagethey were in. I tried to listen without a theoretical filter to their frustrations andcomplaints and found that behind every complaint was a wish, and the wish wasfor a relationship that was safe and passionate. I experimented with a structuredconversation that I now call Imago dialogue and found the structure helped createsafety and safety led to recovering passion/intimacy. The next thing I learned wasthat restoring connection in adult intimate partnerships healed the memories ofruptured connection in childhood. This insight was exciting to me: Helping cou-ples connect was a healing experience in the present that healed memories in thepast. It also seemed profound. What surprises me even more today is that, essen-tially, healing occurs when couples change the structure of their conversation froma vertical to a horizontal axis, and the content of their conversation from judgment(criticism- negativity) to acceptance and appreciation. These actions relocate thesource of the healing process from the person to the relationship, thus turning tra-ditional psychological theory upon its head, or at least on its side. Rather than lo-cating healing inside persons, as a subjective experience, it locates healing amongpersons. This is essentially a new paradigm, which I call the \"relational paradigm\"that extends and replaces the paradigm of the \"individual.\" It also overcomes thesplit between psychotherapy and spirituality by showing that they are essentiallythe same thing. Connection is healing, whether viewed from the sacred or secularperspective. JL: Your book and DVD, Through Conflict to Connection , promotes inti- macy and a genuine connection. How is your new approach even more of aspiritual path? HH: And then the surprise came! When couples achieved sustainable connec- tion with each other, oneness with each other, they also felt more integrated and co-hesive inside\u2014they felt oneness with themselves\u2014wholeness, and they reportedfeeling at one with the larger context of their lives, including what they called alarger dimension, oneness with everyone and everything. As we have explored thisnew path to the sacred, we have discovered that dialogue is a new spiritual prac-tice that parallels traditional spiritual disciplines such as meditation and prayer.When we ask listening partners to quiet their minds and focus on the messages ofthe partner who is sending, they not only listen more accurately and deeply butthey become more peaceful inside. They refer to this as being more centered sim-ilar to what is described by peolple who meditate. As a parallel process, when we ask the partner who is talking in a dialogue to focus on inner experiencing\u2014 thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations\u2014rather than describing their partner, theyalso become more peaceful inside, as do meditators. When both speak from the\"heart\" and listen from the \"heart,\" they create a safe a safe emotional environ-ment that allows an even deeper healing and connection to occur. And then a sortof miracle occurs: Removing anxiety and defenses from the conversation allowswhat we call implicit, un-languaged experiencing to enter consciousness and be-come symbolized in words. When this happens, emotional memories that havebeen housed in the amygdala are translated into words and relocated in the hip-pocampus\u2014thus putting the past in the past. This process integrates alienated andisolated aspects into the self, thus contributing to the recovery of wholeness, whichIN THE SPIRIT OF THERAPY is another aspect of healing that is both spiritual andpsychological at the same time. With all these discoveries, we have declared that \"couplehood is a spiritual path, and dialogue is aspiritual practice,\" thus adding conscious couple-hood as the container of the spiritual. JL: When people read your work, or see your DVD's they get a sense of you as a deeply spiri-tual person. Are there things that you would bewilling to share about that side of you personallife? Or to pose the question from a professionalperspective, what aspects of the work do you find the most spiritually fulfilling? HH: I was ordained to the ministry in the Southern Baptist Church in 1952 and have a theological degree from Union Theological Seminary, NYC. I have twodegrees that combine theology and psychology, both from the University ofChicago. From age 17 to 73, having obsessively been involved in exploring thedeepest mysteries of life and the literature about it, my spirituality has changedfrom an explicit religious focus on beliefs and rituals to awe and gratitude aboutthe how amazing it is that anything exists, and how amazing everything is that doesexist. My favorite spiritual statement is \"We GET to be here!! Professionally, what I find most spiritually fulfilling about this work is seeing couples embody love and become whole. It is the wonder that becoming spiritualor discovering our implicit spirituality involves nothing more that turning towardsour neighbor and changing the way we talk and what we talk about. When we seeour neighbors as equals and acknowledge and appreciate their existence, I think weare sharing in Jesus declaration that \"the law and the gospel are fulfilled when welove God with all our hearts and our neighbor as ourselves.\" The Milton H. Erickson Foundation Newsletter VOL. 29, NO. 3 5 The Milton H. Erickson Foundation Newsletter 6 VOL. 29, NO. 3 Fitting In A private girl's school nearby my office referred a sophomore namedLana to my practice because of missedclasses and academic problems. Normally when a girl this age comes to a professional for the firsttime, she pays attention to her appear-ance. But Lana's hair was disheveled,her sweat suit looked like it needed atrip to the washing machine, and hersneakers were worn. Her clothing wastoo big, meant to camouflage herweight. She was definitely not com-fortable in her skin. If one lookedcloser, underneath all this baggage wasan attractive, intelligent young lady. Based on her general appearance I assumed several things: I intuited thatLana was depressed. I asked myself,\"Why does she keep her appearance re-pulsive?\" Had someone hurt her in thepast; met with abuse or neglect a cre-ative element in her personality? Herrepulsive appearance, no doubt, was tokeep herself isolated enough to deflectany more harm. Fortunately, Lana was enthusiasticCASE REPORT about hypnosis and wanted to experi- ence it. Hilgard wrote that one of is\"original induction is pac-ing and leading. My procedure was in-formed by both philosophies. I began by asking Lana, \"What about hypnosis makes you enthusias-tic?\" Her response was that she hadheard wonderful things about hypno-sis, and that the experience of trance,in addition to being relaxing, seemedmysterious and exotic. She felt hypno-sis helped people to make dramaticchanges in short periods of time, likequitting a lifelong habit of smoking inone session. I wholeheartedly agreed.As I mirrored this back to Lana, I re-peated the words \"relaxing\" \"mysteri-ous\" and \"exotic\" in pace with each ofher exhale breaths. I began to addwords suggesting comfort, sleep, anddreamlike feelings. I also suggested that her uncon- scious mind probably knew why shewas having these current problems. Itwould be nice if her unconscious gaveher a dream during the next few daysthat would illuminate the source of these problems and offer a solution thatwould alter the way she looked at thisaspect of her past. Her enlightenmentwould provide a new perspective inhow she would see herself in the fu-ture. I told her to keep this in the backof her mind. I finished our trance session by telling Lana a story about how I alwaysmade myself go to all of my collegeclasses whether they were interestingor boring, because there might be atleast one useful thing from them that Icould take away with me. Two days later, Lana sent me the following email: \"During our session,you told me to keep one thing in theback of my mind. Ever since I can re-member, I have struggled with myweight. The memory that came tomind during our trance was one of my-self at about eight or nine years old atschool. A boy I've known most of mylife was standing next to me and said,\"Y ou look like you are pregnant be-cause you are so fat!\" Every time Ithink about my weight struggle, thismemory seems to pop into my mind. Itwas definitely an embarrassing and up-setting moment in my life. After our session, I felt very sleepy and ended up going to bed quite early.I had a dream that I was standing in myhouse trying on a prom dress that I had Erickson Grant Follow up Several months ago an anonymous donor gave $5000 to initiate a grant com- petition. The donor expressed hope that the competition would promote commu-nication and strengthen understanding of Ericksonian approaches around the world. This summer three winners were named, and the award was split equally. The breadth of their intentions, geography and projects are truly reflective of the intentof the competition. The winners briefly describe their projects: Hayley Klein B.S., Houston, Texas, USA - As a recent college graduate with an interest in learning more about Ericksonian approaches, I was eager to submita proposal. As I have traveled and corresponded with others in Spanish, I havenoticed some hesitations and inconsistencies in the translation of psychotherapeu-tic terms. Ideas like \"time distortion\" and \"deep trance,\" are sometimes difficultto grasp in English, so it is not surprising there is come confusion when those termsare translated. With this in mind, I proposed a Multi-Lingual Glossary of Erick- sonian Terminology . Working with teams of experts, I compiled operational defi- nitions of approximately 200 words in English. Now I am involved in thetranslation phase: Portuguese and Russian teams are in progress, and I am work-ing to arrange translation teams in several other languages. I am hoping that thefinal compilation will be ready for the Foundation website early next year. Teresa Garcia Sanchez, MA, ECP. Director of Instituto Erickson Madrid, Spain A few months after the opening of the Institute Erickson Madrid in 1980, I began working with a young man who had been diagnosed two years prior as hav- ing a serious neurological disease, multiple sclerosis. His symptoms were severe:strong pain, partial or total paralyses, even blindness. Using Ericksonian psy-chotherapy and hypnosis, I encouraged a quick recovery from attacks, and miti-gation of the powerful side effects of the medications. Now, the doctors who aretreating him certify him as 95% recovered. Comparing current and old brain scansthe white scars have almost disappeared! I presented this case as a scientific paperbought with the intention of altering it to fit. I still own the dress, but I nevergot to wear it to my prom because itdidn't fully zip in the back and theseamstress couldn't alter it. In thedream, I put the dress on simply to seeif it would fit me. At first it would notzip, and then little by little I was show-i n gm ym o mh o wi tn o wf i tm ep e r -fectly! When I woke up this morning,it didn't immediately occur to me whyI had this dream until right before I wasleaving my room to go to class.\" A follow-up call to the school's counseling center a month later re-vealed that Lana had achieved perfectattendance at her classes and hadjoined the school swim team. She wasfinally \"fitting in\"! Because Lana had to take a taxi to get to our appointments, I knew Iwould not see her for more than a fewsessions. I would have liked to spendmore time discussing relationships, de-velopmental delay issues, and her de-pression. I decided to use Erickson'sapproach of accessing unconscious re-sources because this has proved suc-cessful in my work in the past.Although I anticipated success, receiv-ing Lana's email was a delight. How'sthat for the unconscious as helper! Dave Norton, LPC New Britain, Connecticut \"Hypnosis as co-adjuvant of a Multiple Sclerosis treatment\" at 2009 the ASCH Congress in Boston. The neurologist proposed that I do a research study with a larger group of pa- tients; she maintained that this degree of recovery in patients with similar condi-tions is less that 10%. The Grant funds will help us to follow up with additionalwork and case studies. We have three former students of the Instituto EricksonMadrid who have volunteered to facilitate ongoing work with multiple sclerosis pa-tients, and we are hopeful that more exploration of this important area will help toreveal more promising approaches to treatment. Anatoly Tkachey M.A., The Erickson Institute of West Siberia -W eh a v e studied the therapeutic communication of Milton Erickson since the 1990s. Ourattention was attracted by the fact that some non-verbal micro-communicationalpatterns, such as voice intonations and non-verbal activities were used literally aslanguage. We studied some of his work and our findings were published in the re-port, \"The Paths of Ericksonian Knowledge: Deepening, Widening the Boundaries,Going Beyond and Existing Forever\". We presented at The 7th International Con-gress of Ericksonian Approaches in 1999 and shared our report with all the Erick-son Institutes. In what sense can we call this phenomenon language? The non-verbal patterns systematically used by Dr. Erickson dynamically composed a whole continuum ofmeanings that accompanied verbal communications. Dr Erickson was able toswitch subject's attention between messages in primary and secondary languages. Our project involves analyzing audiotapes of Dr Erickson working from 1952 to 1962 focusing on voice intonations and their use in the therapeutic process. Bystudying tapes year by year we will be able to track the dynamics of the use ofthose patters as well as the dynamics of Dr Erickson's methodology. The researchprocess and the results will be published in real time via blogs so interested col-leagues and professionals will be able to see it, and some might even be able to takepart in the work.The Milton H. Erickson Foundation Newsletter VOL. 29, NO. 3 7 The Evolution of an Idea: The Milton H. Erickson Institutes - Past, Present, and Future Marilia Baker Phoenix Institute of Ericksonian Therapy The Milton H. Erickson Foundation is soon celebrating the evolution of the thought and clinical practice of dozens of the most influential thinkers and practi-tioners of our time, at the 6th Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference ,t ot a k ep l a c e December 9-13, 2009. There will be a pre-conference on Tuesday, December 8,presented by illustrious pioneers in the medical field, Daniel Amen, MD and An-drew Weil, MD, and, a post-conference Master Class with psychotherapy pioneers,Erving Polster, Ph.D. and Jeffrey Zeig, Ph.D. As we honor them all, and benefitfrom their lifework. It is also of significance to pay homage to the ones who plantedthe many seeds - the ideas - so this fruitful gathering could take place. First, to Milton H. Erickson, MD, who, in the words of Sharon McLaughlin, MA, this Newsletter 's Managing Editor, \"was a planter of seeds. His history reflects the lessons of farm life. Erickson taught his students that ideas, like seeds, whichwere planted in the past and nurtured in the present, will continue to grow andflourish into the future. The network of Ericksonian Institutes is one example ofsuch generative growth.\" (MHE Foundation Newsletter , V ol. 21 n. 2, Centennial Issue, p. 6). Likewise, of significance, is the evolution of the Foundation's founding direc- tor. Jeffrey Zeig's many fruitful ideas. His indefatigable sense of mission through-out the past 36 years was to realize his dream of seeing the teachings Milton H.Erickson disseminated and practiced throughout the world. It has happened ex-ceedingly well. Says Zeig: \"The Erickson Institutes were initiated by professionals who made the request to establish them to Dr. Erickson. As I remember there were only a fewauthorized by Dr. Erickson in the late 70s - two in Munich, NYSEPH, Santa Rosa,and Albuquerque. When Dr. Erickson passed away the Foundation took over thefunction of authorizing Institutes\". \"The Institutes are an integral part of the mission of the Foundation, playing an important role in promoting and advancing Ericksonian practice. Institutes can beprivate practices, study groups, societies, and so on\". \"The continuing proliferation of Institutes around the world is especially grat- ifying. The Board of Directors of the Foundation greatly appreciates the wisdomand enthusiasm that they provide\". Zeig's recollection is accurate. The initial Institutes Dr. Erickson gave permis- sion to establish in 1978 has grown to 140 as of 2009. One of the first personallyauthorized by Dr. Erickson was Burkhard Peter in Germany (1978) who then es-tablished the M.E.G. ( Milton Erickson Gessellschaft fur Klinische Hypnose ), one of the largest and most influential society of Institutes in Europe, with a networkof 17 affiliated Institutes and approximately 2,000 members. As McLaughlin ob-served in 2001, \" As a catalyst for fostering interest in Ericksonian approaches and research, MEG has been extremely influential, including offering financial sup-port for universities conducting research in hypnosis\". At this time, MEG pub-lishes a biannual newsletter with a circulation of approximately 30,000professionals (See http://www.MEG-Hypnose.de ) Another important development in Europe since 1997 has been the creation of theConfederation Francophone d'Hypnose et Therapies Breves which encom- passes not only the Institutes in France but also all others in French-speaking coun-tries: Switzerland, Belgium, Quebec (Canada) and the Caribbean. Highly active,this organization counts approximately 3,000 clinician members and promotesworkshops and congresses throughout the Francophone world. France itself en-compasses a large number of MHE Institutes (12) that train a significant numberof professional clinicians throughout Europe, Canada and Mexico. The foundingpresident of the Confederation Francophone is Patrick Bellet, MD. In addition to president of the MHE Institute d'Avignon-Provence he is also the Editor-in Chiefof the Revue d'hypnose et therapies breves the largest circulation journal on hyp- nosis throughout the francophone world. There are MHE Institutes from Argentina (4) to New Zealand (1), with ongo- ing interest and expansion into Turkey, the MHEI of Istanbul, to the MHEI ofKaohsiung in Taiwan. Mexico has the largest foreign constituency of Instituteswith 18 as of this date, followed by Brazil with 14 established MHEIs. For furtherinformation please go to: www.erickson-foundation.org Mexico leads many initiatives in the Americas under the sustained enthusiasm and leadership of Teresa Robles, Ph.D. One of them was the first officially recog-nized (Mexico's Ministry of Education and Health) master's degree program inEricksonian psychotherapy. Currently in its 10th year, the program continues toexpand into many affiliated Institutes throughout Mexico and Brazil. Robles alsohas been actively promoting national and international dialogue, hosting, in 2006in Acapulco, the 17th Congress of the International Society of Hypnosis (ISH)with worldwide participation and repercussion. (See: www.hipnosis.com.mx ) The Milton Erickson Institute of South Africa (MEISA) under the leadership of Woltemade Hartman has, likewise, been tirelessly promoting in-country and in-ternational fraternization since its founding in 2001, through its numerous confer-ences and congresses. In 2006, it hosted the internationally acclaimed 2nd WorldCongress on Ego State Therapy \"The Changing Faces of Psychotherapy\" and ispreparing to host the 3rd Ego State Therapy gathering in February 2010. Of sig-nificant and meaningful note is to acknowledge Milton Hyland Erickson's far reaching seeding and influence, in the words of Woltemade Hartman and co-di- rectors: \"We have now reached the stage where our training courses have gainedtremendous popularity amongst professionals in Africa and more specifically inSouth Africa, Swaziland and Namibia. The legacy of Milton Erickson has surelyhad an impact on African psychotherapists. It is said that Ericksonian principles re-spect African culture, African traditions, African life and African traditional heal-ing methods as well as human dignity in general. In fact, this naturalistic,permissive and contextualized approach is democratizing the African psyche byhelping clients to broach their adversities of the past and to increasingly focus onfinding solutions for their future.\"(See: www.meisa.co.za ) It should be mentioned that all Institutes throughout the United States and throughout the world have been unique, active and tireless in their clinical work,their teaching, and dissemination of Ericksonian thought and practice. All havesignificantly contributed to the ever growing numbers of interested professionalswho request permission form the Foundation to establish MHE Institutes in theircountries of origin. Many words of praise to each and everyone. Last, but not least, the role of the Societa' Italiana Milton Erickson (SIME) also receives honorable mention in this overview. Established in 1996, it has beenactively promoting Ericksonian methodologies and teachings since then, through-out Italy and the world. Camillo Loriedo, MD, its founding president is also mem-ber of the Board of Directors of the Erickson Foundation. His Institute was alsodistinguished in Europe to be academically recognized by the Italian Ministry ofEducation to teach Ericksonian hypnosis and psychotherapy. Loriedo and a dis-tinguished team of professors and instructors have been actively teaching sincethen at the Scuola Italiana d'Ipnosi at SIME. This last September, SIME hosted in Rome, the International Society of Hypnosis's 18th congress \"Hypnosis and Neu-roscience - clinical implications of the new mind-body paradigm.\" The future is bright and encouraging. Ericksonians from all over the world con- tinue to practice Ericksonian approaches to their best and ever increasing abilities.Erickson's words are an apt conclusion for the beginning of other seeding to suc-ceed and to emerge in the evolution of psychotherapy fields: \"Life isn't somethingyou can give an answer to today. Y ou should enjoy the process of becoming whoyou are. There is nothing more delightful than planting flower seeds and not know-ing what kind of flowers are going to come up\"INTRODUCING THE INSTITUTESThe Milton H. Erickson Foundation Newsletter 8 VOL. 29, NO. 3 Roxanna Erickson- Klein, RN, Ph.D. Interviewed by Sharon McLaughlin Sharon McLaughlin (SM): How did you become involved in the workof The Milton H. Erickson Founda-tion? Roxanna Erickson-Klein (REK): My parents Milton and Elizabeth Er-ickson raised eight children of which Iam seventh. Dad literally and figura-tively brought his work home withhim--so it is really a matter of circum-stances. Growing up in the family weall learned a familiarity with and an ap-preciation for his approaches to hyp-nosis and psychotherapy, SM: You have worked with the Foundation for a long time... REK: Y es, for over 20 years. The Foundation was founded in 1980; mymother and sister Kristi were both onthe Board of Directors. In 1990, I lookKristi's place on the Board. In 1993, Iworked with another sister, BettyAlice, on the Newsletter for a five-yearinterval. Now my efforts emphasizeArchival work; I manage to volunteerabout five hours a week on projectsthat I think are most important. SM: Who would you say had the most influence on you? REK: That is a hard question. My parents were both loving and powerfulpeople whose influence is felt far andwide even after their deaths. In answerto your question though, I think I willidentify my oldest brother Bert, asbeing the person who was always thereto help me navigate difficult waters orto help me find meaningful guideposts.My youngest sister Kristi also has astrong internal compass that I know Ican depend on. The strongest relation-ship I chose for my life is with Alan,my husband of 35 years. Our lifetimecommitment through all our owngrowth and the joys of raising our fivechildren is an extraordinary blessing. SM: What professional activities are you involved in? REK: I consider my most impor- tant endeavor now to continue workingwith Ernest and Kathryn Rossi on thecompilation of the Collected Works of Milton H. Erickson MD . These are cen-CONTRIBUTOR OF NOTE tral to the Archives, and the royalties help to fund more projects; Ernest withhis insurmountable energy is hard tokeep up with; this year there will befour more volumes published. Withthe unpublished works we still have onhand we foresee numerous volumes onthe horizon. I enjoy serious writing. Dan Short invited me to be third author in hisbook Hope and Resiliency about my father's therapeutic techniques. I havealso worked with Marilia Baker writ-ing about my mother. I feel great grat-ification when others honor me byasking that I contribute to a book.Right now, I am involved in what I feelis among the most important originalprojects of my professional career\u2014Iam working with my daughter Hayleyto compile an Ericksonian Glossary.This offers definitions of terminologyused to describe Dad's work and willhave a Multi-lingual component to fa-cilitate translation. One of the very im-portant aspects of this project is theteamwork involved to make it a reality.I consider teamwork to be a central el-ement of the whole Ericksonian ideol-ogy. This particular project hasinvolved positive cooperative effortsthat reach beyond anything I have hadthe privilege of working on in the past. Writing is enjoyable and relaxing for me. I have a lot of ideas, and have out-lined some additional works that I hopeto follow through to publication. I am also back in school. I am studying counseling at Argosy Univer-sity of Dallas. I want to have a deeperunderstanding of how psychological interventions enhance the physicalhealing process. Being a student againis stimulating. My background withmy parents, my work in nursing andmy involvement with the Milton H. Er-ickson Foundation gives me a ratherbroad perspective of the fields of coun-seling and psychotherapy and how ithas been influenced by the context oftime over the last half century. SM: What do you consider the most important work of the Founda-tion? REK: Without a moment's hesita- tion it is the Archives. Few people re-alize the tremendous effort that isinvolved in the gathering and compila-tion of archives of any productive per-son. It is a very labor-intensive processthat involves time, patience, resourcesand cooperative effort. Archives provide central under- standings about the history and evolu-tion of ideology. Generations benefitfrom viewing the art of masters; Erick-son's work is art within science. Asscientists, we are only at the most rudi-mentary stages of understanding howsuggestion and perception can influ-ence our entire life course. My father'swork offers us glimpses of how pow-erful that influence can be. SM: How is your own work like that of your father? REK: I get invitations to come and teach because people are looking for experiences that resemble studyingwith Erickson. Y et, if I were really likehim, I wouldn't be true to his ideas.Each of us who is loyal to his work de-veloped in our own ways; he advocatedfinding one's own path and style, andevolving through inspiration fromwithin. My commitment is to honorhis legacy while also simultaneouslydeveloping my own unique style. Ihave an interest in the underpinnings,foundation, methodology, and ideologyincluding the principles of cooperativeefforts, unselfish giving and teamwork.It goes unsaid that fundamental princi-ples involve an ethical commitment tothe well being of the client and to soci-ety. There is room for everyone toachieve a high level of professionalismand to do so without compromising thebasic tenets of the Erickson message. SM: Where are you going from here? REK: I want to finish school at Argosy, complete my internship, con-tinue working with the Rossis on fol-lowing through with the Collected Works of Milton Erickson , and con- tinue working with Hayley on the Er- icksonian Glossary . On the personal side, nothing could exceed sharingwith my husband the pleasures of ourchildren developing into a diverse con-stellation of productive young adults. P AID ADVERTISEMENTThe Milton H.

Co-Director Instituto Erickson Madrid In February of this year, Dr. Ernest Rossi did therapy at the Instituto Er-ickson in Madrid, Spain from his homein California! Drs. Ernest and KathrynRossi had arranged for their EricksonInstitute of the Central CaliforniaCoast at Los Osos to join Madrid Insti-tute in offering a 12 hour, two-dayseminar using Internet video confer-encing. Before the event, the communica- tions systems were installed and tested,though our Madrid group remained ap-prehensive about the technological el-ements of our first virtual seminar viathe Internet. We wanted it to be as in-teractive as possible for Dr. Rossi to beable to carry out real therapeutic ses-sions from his California home withvolunteer subjects in Madrid. Videoand audio systems at both locations al-lowed for simultaneous bidirectionalcommunications. People at the Insti-tuto in Madrid could watch Dr. Rossiprojected on a screen in real size. Asmall window showing our own cam-era allowed us to see our images as weprojected the Madrid subject and audi-ence into the Rossi's home. This com-pound presentation gave a better senseof interaction and physical presence.Dr. Rossi did several demonstra- tions throughout the seminar. Stepswere taken to attend to the privacy andconfidentiality of our subjects; becausethe Rossis' use a technique which doesnot require extensive disclosure, manyof the concerns were minimized.Translators were used in both direc-tions. Surprisingly, our efforts were re-warded with satisfying results thatwere even better than expected. Sub-jects participating in the sessions con-firmed afterwards they felt close to Dr.Rossi. A very special demonstration took place on the first day of the program.Dr. Ernest Rossi had worked previ-ously with a young man who shares hisfirst name: Ernesto. The subject hadbeen diagnosed with Multiple Sclero-sis some years before and Ernest hadworked with Ernesto in June of 2003,at the peak of his illness. Ernesto hadgone through an amazing recovery being treated with hypnotherapy ad-ministered by Teresa Garcia-Sanchez,Director of the Institute Erickson ofMadrid as an adjunct to his chemother-apy. Ernesto has gone into full remis-sion and was on the stage with hisgirlfriend whom also actively partici-pated in the session. Another demonstration on the sec- ond day of the seminar was also a veryrich learning experience. The subjectreported feeling a very great impact ofher therapy, and Rossi was able to de-scribe the transformation in four stagesof creative psychotherapeutic processes Treasure Finds Way Home By Kristina Erickson M.D. The Erickson family is working with the EricksonFoundation to arrange for thesale of the home where Mil-ton and Elizabeth Ericksonlived in Phoenix since 1970.We anticipate the develop-ment of a museum, the cen-terpiece of which will be theoffice where Erickson workedas well.

The smalloffice was filled with artifacts that Milton Erickson used in his teaching; many ofthe treasures were gifts from students. A technique that he often used was a chal-lenging puzzle that students would ponder over, not noticing the answer on displayon a nearby shelf or wall. After Milton Erickson's death, Elizabeth Erickson gave many of the artifacts to special students and colleagues. Some went back to the original owners, andothers were carefully given to individuals who would treasure them. Although theoffice has retained its feel and appearance, many of Erickson's favorite teachingitems have found new homes. We expect to open the Erickson Museum in 2010. We also are hoping to have the opportunity to display artifacts that are now in the hands of private individu-als. We are arranging for an agreement in which the owner of the artifact will ownthe object but put it on permanent loan so it can be displayed in the office. Ifyou have an artifact that once was in Milton Erickson's office, and you arewilling to put it on permanent display, please contact Roxanna Klein rerickson klein@gmail.com who is coordinating this process. We offer our gratitude to Jan Henley Ph.D., who is shown holding the carving she is now returning to the mu-seum for display. The carving was mentioned in the seminar that is published asExperiencing Erickson (www.zeigtucker.com ). Dr. Zeig has agreed to put all the gifts that he received on permanent loan to the museum.TREASURE continued from page 10 P AID ADVERTISEMENTThe Milton H.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc. USA 631 pages. ISBN 978-0-471-76921-7 (hard cover) Psychotherapy Supervision: Theory, Research and Practice, edited by a family of psychologists: husband, Alan, wife, Kathy, and daughter, Tanya Hess, presentwide coverage of different aspects of supervision including history, perspectives ofparticipants, psychotherapy orientations and modalities, special populations andsetting, research, and ethics. The book begins with a conceptual review by Alan Hess that emphasizes \"the need for a safe place to reflect upon the psychotherapy sessions\" (p.3). He thennarrates some origins of supervision, such as how Freud hosted meetings that con-sisted of theoretical and case discussions that provided refinement for the clini-cian. The text includes important concepts and foci with an emphasis on theimportance of knowing one's self, drives and blind spots so \"...one can listen ef-fectively and intervene in the client's interest\" (p.5). \"On Being Supervised\" by Tanya and Alan Hess has brief suggestions for thesupervisee and the supervisor. One of the suggestions for the supervisor is to be aware of the student's learning level and needs. The supervisor also is encouragedto attend to verbal and nonverbal signals. Some of suggestions for the superviseeare to take an active role and to read pertinent literature. In \"Hypnotherapy Supervision,\" (Chapter 13), C. Alexander and Annellen Simpkins explain how hypnosis can be used therapeutically for helping with a widevariety of problems in a number of fields. We can read about the history and the-ories of hypnosis and how to guide supervisees into using hypnosis by learning toexperience it personally. It is interesting to read how the definition of hypnosis evolved from the timeJames Braid coined the term \"hypnosis,\" and demonstrated how by fixating at- tention onto one thing, the subject could enter a trance. This same chapter makesreference to Milton H. Erickson and how he called the unconscious mind \"a reser-voir of positive potential and that the hypnotic state activates unconscious intelli-gence\" (p. 231). Tips and Pitfalls show how to work with supervisees' questionsand resistances. This chapter also addresses how to deal with problems in super-visees, for example when they have fears and reservations about the use of hyp-nosis. At the other end of the spectrum are the supervisees who are overenthusiasticabout the method and make unrealistic promises. . Bertram P . Karon writes about \"Supervising Therapists Treating the Severely Mentally Ill.\" The author covers a fundamental idea in the lives of psychotic peo-ple: \"Serious disorders can easily be found to have arisen from horrible life expe-riences,\" (p. 361) and yet these patients do not understand their experiences and doBOOK REVIEW See SUPERVISION on page 16The Milton H.

He served aschief of staff at Boston Regional Med-ical Center before establishing theChopra Center . He is a fellow of theAmerican College of Physicians, amember of the American Association ofClinical Endocrinologists, and adjunctprofessor at Kellogg School of Man-agement. He is the founder of theChopra Center for Wellbeing, a world-renowned authority in the field ofmind-body healing, and a best-sellingauthor of over 42 books, published inmore than eighty-five languages. Gary Ruelas (GR): Dr. Chopra, you are going to be speaking at theEvolution of Psychotherapy Confer-ence this December sponsored by the Milton H. Erickson Foundation. Dr.Erickson was a pioneer in the field ofmental health with his belief in thefundamental principles of the bodyand mind and the use of the person'sinternal resources to help individu-als overcome their difficulties. Youhave described your work in a simi-lar vein. I'm just wondering whetheror not you could elaborate on howyou view the body and mind? Depok Chopra (DC): First of all, you know this is an artificial distinc-tion, the body and the mind. Also thebody and the environment are artificialdistinctions. It's all one process - theenvironment, the body, and the mind isone process, and that process is aprocess in consciousness. Y ourthoughts occur in your consciousnessand you experience your body in yourconsciousness and you experience theworld in your consciousness. It is im-portant to understand that these are dif-ferentiated expressions. The body, theworld, and the mind are differentiatedexpressions of one consciousness. I think the future of our under- standing of human behavior, of socialinteractions and well-being has to bebased on a more scientific understand-ing of our consciousness. What is ourconsciousness? What is conscious-ness? Where does it reside? And themore we learn about consciousness the more we also begin to understand thatconsciousness is a transcendent realm.It does not exist in space-time. In fact,space-time is also an experience inconsciousness. Consciousness is afield of possibilities; consciousnessproliferates in uncertainty; conscious-ness constantly takes leaps of creativ-ity; consciousness harnesses thepower of intention; of insight, of inspi-ration, of creativity, of choice making. So we have to stop these distinc- tions - body and mind, biological or-ganism and environment. It's oneprocess and the process is all in con-sciousness. Our future evolution de-pends on the evolution of ourconsciousness. How can we go be-yond these primitive responses that wehave - reactive responses, fight-flightresponses - to how we can be a watch-ful observer of our body and mind, thewatchful observer of our relationships,the watchful observer of our environ-ment. And then how can we go beyondthat into the intuitive response, into thecreative response, into what is calledthe \"visionary\" response, and ulti-mately into the sacred response, whichis to get in touch with the source ofall creation, the mystery that peoplecall God. GR: You have already segued into my second question - and thankyou so much for expanding on that -regarding a profound paradigm shiftthat you're articulating so well. Just as a little bit of backgound here; you started your formal prac-tice and completed your residency ininternal medicine, endocrinology, inthe late 60's. Since then the field ofpsychotherapy has really changedfrom paradigms of analytical or be-havioral paradigms to what it istoday. What other changes do yousee occurring in the future for men-tal health professionals, especially inits application to helping those whoare going through emotional and cognitive challenges? DC: Y ou mentioned cog- nitive challenges, so I thinkthe future of therapy is called\"Native Therapy,\" which is ac-tually beginning to engage inthe understanding of thinking. Why do we think the thoughts that we think? What is the na-ture of our cognitive process?How do we go beyond limit-ing belief systems that havebeen conditioned in ourawareness through society andthrough culture and throughreligion? So I see therapy tak-ing a big leap in this area. I also see therapy engag- ing in practices like introspec-tion and meditation andinsight and understanding themechanics of creativity andinspiration. So I think that we have a bright fu- ture if we look at the future of therapyin spiritual terms. It has to go beyondjust mere mental understanding, andbegin to understand the nature of ourspiritual intelligence, that domain ofawareness where we experience thetranscendent and where we go beyondour personal limited self into our col-lective self and ultimately experiencethe universal domain of consciousness.I see a very bright future for therapy with a newer understanding of con- sciousness. GR:And you mentioned incorpo- rating or addressing the spiritual do-main twice now in yourexplanations. Would you just elabo-rate a little bit more for our readers? DC: All of our sciences have been focused on what makes people un-happy and we have a lot of science onstress. But there is very little scienceso far--but it is emerging--on whatmakes people happy, what makes peo-ple loving, what makes people kind,what makes people compassionate,what makes people do things that areof service to others without selfish mo-tivation. So I think that spirituality-- that domain of awareness where weunderstand this domain of awareness,changes not only the way we think butalso the way we behave in society andin our personal relationships, and ourrelationship with our environment. GR: It really changes paradigms in many, many domains. DC: Many. Everything from per- sonal relationships to behavior to biol-ogy to environment - GR: To economics.DC: - to economics. GR: Yes, everything. That's re- ally a quite a direction for all of us tobegin to embrace. DC: Y es. GR: There's been a lot of changes in the mental health field that has todo with changes in pharmacology,imaging, genomic testing. How doyou see the whole direction of themental health movement? DC: I think there is an over-re- liance on pharmacology, and an over-reliance on imaging, which is actuallydistracting because no amount of brainimaging actually tells you anythingabout consciousness. It just tells youthe location of where consciousness isacting on the brain. So, you knowwhen you imagine a beautiful sunset,there's no sunset in your brain. Thereare only electrical impulses. The beau-tiful sunset that you see is in your con-sciousness. Of course, there is a INTERVIEW See CHOPRA on page 16I think there is an over-reliance on pharmacology, and an over-reliance on imaging, which is actually distracting because no amount of brain imaging actually tells you anything about consciousness.The Milton H. Erickson Foundation Newsletter VOL. 29, NO. 3 15 Andrew Weil, M.D. Interviewed by Gary Ruelas July 20, 2009 Andrew Weil, received his Medical Degree from Harvard in 1968 follow-ing a medical internship in San Fran-cisco, and worked for the NationalInstitute of Mental Health. He is theProgram Director in Integrative Medi-cine at the University of Arizona and aClinical Professor of Internal Medicineand Clinical Assistant Professor ofFamily Medicine. He is the founder ofthe Foundation for Integrative Medi-cine and editor-in-chief of the journalIntegrative Medicine. Dr . Weil is theauthor of many scientific articles andseven books: including SpontaneousHealing; and Eight Weeks to OptimumHealth. He is featured on PBS: Spon-taneous Healing and Eight Weeks toOptimum Health. Gary Ruelas (GR): We are so excited that you will be speakingthis December at the Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference sponsored by the Milton H. Erickson Founda- tion. Andrew Weil (A W): Thank you. GR: Dr. Erickson who, by the way, also lived in Arizona, was a pi-oneer in the field of mental healthand strongly believed in the funda-mental principles of the body andmind. It appears to me that yourwork and commitment to the field ofmental health parallels Dr. Erick-son's work in using natural internalresources of the individual to over-come their difficulties. AW: Well, first of all, integrative medicine, which I helped found and isthe main focus of my work, insists thatpeople are mental and emotional be-ings as well as physical bodies. Thatdimension needs to be taken into ac-count in understanding health and ill-ness. So in any case of physical illness,integrative medicine physicians inquireinto the mental well- being of patientsand try to understand the mental andemotional factors that might have con-tributed to illness, and to look for waysof intervening there as well. So, I thinkmore than regular physicians, we tendto draw on the resources of mentalhealth professionals. In integrative medicine we really have a strong commitment to try anddevelop a new field of integrative men-tal health. One of the initiatives of ourINTERVIEW Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona is an integrativemental health conferenc e - a national conference that's going to take placenext March in Phoenix. GR: That is really interesting. Where do you see this directionheaded? AW: This project is intended to try to launch a movement among psychia-trists, psychologists, social workers,and others to start a new field of inte-grative mental health that draws on allapproaches, not just pharmacothera-peutics. GR: Do you foresee that integra- tive medicine will help promote men-tal health? AW: Y es, in terms of drawing on internal resources for healing, a funda-mental tenet of integrative medicine,that the body is capable of healing it-self and that good medicine beginswith the premise that the body can andwants to be healthy, and our first job isto figure out what's blocking this heal-ing both physically and mentally. GR: You started your formal practice in medicine after obtainingyour M.D. from Harvard in '68.Since then the field of psychotherapyhas changed drastically from the an-alytical behavior paradigm in thelate 60s, when you first finished med-ical school, to the current trend of re-lying more on psychotropicmedications. What other changes doyou see today in the field of mentalhealth and especially those relevantfor integrative medicine providers? AW: Some of the good signs I see are the development of the variousforms of positive psychology, thelearned optimism work, the field of cognitive behavioral therapy. I thinkthere is beginning to be a new re-spectability for mind/body therapy,such as hypnosis and guided imagery. Ithink all of that is for the good. But on the other side, I think the re- liance on pharmaceutical for all prob-lems remains problematic. I would saythat the massive oppression and domi-nation of the biomedical model has hada crippling effect on the field of mentalhealth. The fact is that these drugs, andthe promises made in pharmaceuticalads, just do not match the reality. AndI would predict, for example, that theSSRI antidepressants will eventuallybe shown to be no better than placebos.I think there will be a huge massiveearthquake in the field of mentalhealth. I further think that this idea that all mental illness derives from disorderedbrain biochemistries is just not true,and is very limiting in what it offers tothe field of mental health. GR: Consistent with that per- spective, how do you foresee the roleof psychotherapy and psychothera-pists, in general, fitting in with thehealth trend that is moving towardintegrative medicine? AW: First of all, as I said, we physicians who practice integrativemedicine really insist that people aremind/bodies. I think the great tragedy,especially in 20th Century medicine, isthat mental health and medicine hasbecome so separate. So if a psychia-trist or a mental health worker feels thepatient has a physical problem, they'resent to an internist and then if the in-ternist feels the patient has an emo-tional problem, they're sent to a mentalhealth professional. There's very littleability or possibility of dealing withthis as a whole. I think that in integra-tive medicine, we see this as only partof one picture. So, I would say in integrative med- icine there is a much, much greater rolefor psychotherapists of all sorts andmind/body therapists than there is inconventional medicine. GR: Let us continue along this line of reasoning - many strides havebeen made in the field of pharmacol-ogy, imaging and genomic testing.How does integrative medicine fit inthat picture of technology and, morespecifically, what is the role of thepsychotherapist and therapy in help-ing the mind and body functiongiven the technological growth in theindustry? AW: One of the most interesting areas of technological advancement isthat the brain imaging studies havemade it possible to understand thebrain. Tibetan monks showed thatplacebo responses correlate with acti-vation of specific areas in the brain. Ithink this is revolutionary--that this re-ally gives a concrete reality to states ofconsciousness that have been dis-missed as being instudiable or unreal.So, I think that an understanding of thebrain can lead to expanded paradigmsof medical practice and psychotherapyas a whole. GR: You might have already ad- dressed this issue but I want to giveyou a little bit of an opening to ex-pand on this. Much of psychiatryhas turned toward biological psychi-atry. What are your thoughts ofnonpharmacological interventions inthe treatment of emotion and cogni-tive difficulties? AW: I'm an enormous proponent of those. For example, I regularly usebreath work and similar techniqueswith patients, and I have found this tobe the most effective method of deal-ing with anxiety, panic disorders -much more effective than drugs. Ithink for depression, dietary treat-ments, the use of dietary supplements,like fish oil, aerobic exercise, all ofthese are examples of nonpharmaco-logical approaches that can be strik-ingly effective.

What wouldyou hope a or anon-physician healer could garnerfrom attending your workshop? AW: I think the strategies for pro- moting healthy aging are really strate-gies for general wellness. So I willoffer information about eating, aboutresting, about exercise, about stressneutralization that is readily applicableto all patients. GR:Okay.AW: So it's really about lifestyle.

Simi-larly, supervisors should make the supervision experience a safe place for super-visees to grow personallly as they learn. Chapter 22 , \"Teaching Interventions with the Sexually Disordered\" by Barbara K. Schwartz describes treatment of sex offenders as a form of prevention. By treat-ing the perpetrator, we prevent the crime. Thus there are extra challenges for novicetherapists concerning the typical therapeutic relationship and the therapeutic rela-tionship with this population. Also in chapter 22, the Gender and Sexual Orientation in Supervision section reviews gender issues in the supervision literature. Schwartz shows how to train su-pervisees to become more familiar with the issues so they can work effectivelywith these populations. This is an important chapter since the author points outthat there are \"several contradictory findings related to gender, power communi-cation, and discourse styles\" (p. 561). It covers gay, lesbian, and bisexual issues insupervision and states that training programs about LGB issues \"may be limited,inadequate, and sometimes biased\" (p .567).

Alexander Simpkins, PhD and Annellen Simpkins,PhD: Michael White's work has left usa fruitful legacy that continues to nour-ish the world. Readers can find a re-view of Maps of Narrative Practicefrom Rubin Battino in the Spring 2009issue. Here, Maria Escalante offers an-other perspective on White's finalwork, a gift to us all. Maps of Narrative Practice ad- dresses Narrative Therapy and guidesreaders to understand and implementthis method in their practice. The booklays out the six main areas of narrativepractice: externalizing conversations,re-authoring \"Externalizing conversations\" helps people understand that when they havea problem they are not the problemthemselves. The identity is experiencedas separate from the problem. \"Re-Au-thoring Conversations\" is about tellingour stories as we speak about prob-lems, predicaments and dilemmas. AsWhite explains, \"These or futility\" (p.61). By re-authoring conversations, people mayinclude some of the more neglected butpotentially significant events and ex-periences that are \"out of \"exceptions\". that identity is founded uponan \"association of life\" rather than ona core self. This association is com-posed of the significant figures of aperson's past, present and future. During therapy with children, I have combined Ericksonian Psy-chotherapy and Narrative. If we utilizea narration while interspersing sugges-tions for promoting change we mayhelp child access her inner re-sources. Definitional Ceremonies \"are ritu-BOOK REVIEW als that acknowledge and 'regrade' people's lives, in contrast to many ritu-als of contemporary culture that judgeand degrade people's lives\" (p. 165).The use of ceremonies provides peoplewith the option for telling or perform-ing the stories of their lives before anaudience of carefully chosen outsiderwitnesses. This chapter also refers tothe \"outsider witness.\" Here Whitemakes a list of people who volunteer tojoin him in his work with others. In Narrative Therapy I love the idea of \"exceptions.\" As White states, \"Theidentification of such out-of-phase as-pects of lived experience can provide apoint of entry for the development ofalternative storylines on people's lives.\"(p.219). Perhaps, if someone can lookbeyond the problem they will find a so-lution a lot faster. These exceptions arealso referred to, as \"unique outcomes.\" T h eb o o ki sf i l l e dw i t hd i a l o g s .A conversation that is worth studying isthe one between White and Peter, a 14-year old who is referred to him. The di-alog evolves as White asks questionsthat lead the boy to discover how wellhe could cope with frustration. (p.222). \"Conversations that Highlight Unique Outcomes\" emphasizes the im-portance of people's initiatives in theirlives and how \"one is likely to have agood life when only 97% of one's ini-tiatives in living are stalled or \"when3% of one's initiatives survive.\"(p.232). In \"Scaffolding conversations\" White explains that when people havedifficulties they engage in actions \"thatare keeping with familiar conclusionsabout their lives and relationships\" (p.263). People may become stuck in a\"zone of proximal development\"(p.263). By utilizing conversationalpartnerships, this zone can be tra-versed. The conversations are the scaf-folds that help people proceed acrossthis zone. A chart (Figure 6.3, p. 288)shows a 45 minute dialog that began in\"the known and familiar\" and ended inthe level of learnings and realizations. Michael White passed away on April 4, 2008.

The Courage to Forgive, The Freedom Not To Janis Abrahms Spring, Ph.D., with Michael Spring 2005 Perennial Currents ISBN 0-06-000931-4(pbk.) 254 pages How Can I Forgive You? is a practical self-help book with clear instructions for people injured by a relationship. The scope is sensibly broad: \"A spouse who is un-faithful or abusive; a friend who turns away when needed most; a sibling who re-fuses to help care for an elderly parent; a parent too depressed or too drunk to carefor a child; and even a therapist who hurts as deeply as an offender.\" It is a perfecthomework assignment that can be assigned to patients of strategic, Ericksoniantherapists. Janis and Michael Spring have extensively researched the area and produced a thorough and scholarly work that can be utilized alike by therapist of any orienta-tion including, cognitive, behavioral, analytical, humanistic, family, theological,and contextual therapists. It is refreshing that the authors challenge some of theideas of these approaches in their, \"Search of a working model of forgiveness thatserves real people seeking to survive and transcend the misery of real-life trans-gressions.\" This book can be considered radical because it speaks against the fundamen- talist tenants that believe good people must forgive without question. The Springscall this \"cheap forgiveness.\" Their model of genuine forgiveness asks as much ofthe offender as it does of the offended. It's not about the offender feeling better but being better. They create a safe relationship were trust can be rebuilt and forgive- ness earned, not gifted. The book is both well thought-out and well-written. The brief introduction first debunks dubious assumptions of the past. For example, \"We all know how to for-give. If only we open our hearts, forgiveness will flow.\" The Springs' work againstsuch lofty and absolute terms. They present their ideas with down-to-earth lan-guage that offer many more possibilities of resolution than just to forgive or not toforgive. The organization of the book is divided into four parts: (1) \"Cheap forgive- ness, An Inauthentic Act of Peacekeeping That Resolves Nothing,\" (2) \"Refusingto Forgive, A Rigid Response That Keeps Y ou Entombed in Hate,\" (3) \"Accep-tance, A Healing Gift To Y ourself That Asks Nothing of the Offender,\" and (4)\"Genuine Forgiveness, A Healing Transaction, An Intimate Dance.\" The first threeparts are intended for the hurt party. The fourth part is divided into two sections:The first shows the offender what it takes to earn forgiveness; the second shows thehurt party what it takes to grant forgiveness. An Appendix Follows: \"How the Of-fender's Childhood Wounds Shaped the Way He Treated Y ou.\" This last sectionhelps the hurt party see that the offender's behavior is more a statement about him,not her. The book has a useful notes section and an extensive bibliography andindex. As a cognitive behavioral therapist, this book appealed to me because it is rich in clear steps based on critical thinking; ways to recognize and dispute errors inthinking; critical tasks to be done in order to forgive or not; ways to let go of hurt;and most important, ways to be \"better equipped to stay centered, maintain your-self respect, and rise above the violation.\" I gave the book to couples and have re-ceived glowing feedback from my patients that have read it.

He then describes, with numerouscase examples, several approaches--psychodynamic, Redecision, Ericksonian, MRIstrategic-interactional, and solution-focused--that deliberately attempt both to in-crease the effectiveness and decrease the time required to do the work we do withour clients. In the next chapter, which nicely complements the first, Hoyt provides a use- ful framework for organizing the tasks and skills associated with the differentphases (pre- early, middle, late, follow-through) of treatment; draws parallels be-tween the structure of each therapy session and the overall structure of therapy;and provides numerous questions that can be asked at each juncture to help focustherapy toward goals, resources, and solutions. The next chapter contains some fascinating examples of how Hoyt uses lan- guage and metaphors from literature, music, movies, and other arts to help shapeexperience. Chapter 4, \"Psychotherapy in Organized Healthcare,\" emphasizes theuse of brief therapy to amplify and utilize resources in the service of promoting thehealth of patients and their families; it also describes emerging professional prac-tice opportunities in today's healthcare environment. Chapter 5, \"Everyday Constructivism,\" is a virtuoso description of some of the possibilities and challenges we face when using constructivist approaches. Hoytmoves masterfully back and forth, recounting both personal and clinical episodes.He quotes from Blake, the Buddha, Walt Whitman, Shelley and Shakespeare (aswell as Erickson, Jay Haley, Cloe Madanes, Paul Watzlawick, Michael White, andothers); tells anecdotes; and cogently discusses psychotherapy of Being.\" The writingis charming and deeply insightful. How he knows so much and can organize it insuch an accessible manner is a mystery. Chapter 6, \"Solution-Focused Couple Therapy,\" is an update and expansion of a chapter that appeared in Hoyt's fine 2004 book, The Present is a Gift .H e p r o - vides an extensive review of the principles and practices of the solution-focusedbrief therapy (SFBT) approach, with special applications to work with couples.Features include excerpts from interviews with Steve de Shazer, an elaborate lit-erature review, myriad typical solution-focused questions, connections betweensolution-focused therapy and other competence-based methods, and a fine casehistory. Anyone interested in SFBT will find this chapter more than worth theprice of the whole book.

The book pres-ents Logotherapy principles in a persuasive format for application to work as wellas to personal life for meaning enhancement and fulfillment. The Logotherapymodel has been thought through, adapted and applied by Pattakos to many pur-poses beyond the therapeutic context, such as counseling for values-oriented, busi-ness management and employee life-enrichment. The current book is an expanded paperback edition that includes twelve chap- ters, organized around seven core principles of Logotherapy. The principles are at-titudes and suggestions for living to make a meaningful life possible. First, exercisethe freedom to change your attitude. Then, realize your will to meaning. Detectthe meaning of life's moments. Don't work against yourself. Look at yourself froma distance. Shift your focus of attention. And finally, extend beyond yourself. Anexercise for finding and contemplating personal meaning in the chapter called a\"meaning moment\" is found Lat the end of each chapter, followed by a challengeto apply it. The chapter ends with another short exercise for encouraging extend-ing the meaning personally. This book was used in training programs for guidanceof aid workers in Indonesia after the tsunami and in New Orleans after the disas-trous effects of hurricane Katrina. The first chapter gives an overview of the book, describing the organizing prin- ciples while offering both Pattakos' personal perspective and his insights aboutwork-life. The second recounts some key aspects of Frankl's own life and work,pointing to the wide importance and value of his approach. Pattakos explains howhe came to live his life in accord with the teachings of Logotherapy, finding in-spiration and solace for himself and others through its insights. Personal and his-torical narratives, vignettes, and vivid metaphors characterize, entertain, andcommunicate multiple meanings. The third chapter briefly refers to the seven prin-ciples of Logotherapy in the book. The fourth exhorts readers to choose their ex-istential attitude toward their lives, which is their choice. A fifth chapter focuses onactualizing the will to meaning, followed by a chapter on love and work. The sev-enth chapter concerns intentionality, explaining how negative intentionality can beturned around for freedom from symptoms and self-preoccupation. The eighthchapter teaches about humor and other means of healthy detachment from the bag-gage that we all wish that we did not carry with us. The ninth chapter covers howto turn attention outward, especially at work. To Pattakos, work has value andmeaning, exemplified in his statement, \"We do, therefore we work.\" (p. 162). Thetenth chapter shows how to live life in a larger meaning context. The eleventh ex-tends the principle attitudes into daily life, and the last chapter recounts how these have been applied in life situations to bring change. The book has excellent exercises and illustrations for use in therapy or business situations. For example, an x-y grid as a diagram of life is offered. The x-axis rep-resents the range from meaning to despair. The y-axis represents the range fromfailure to success. Clients then can be mapped and guided. We found this book tobe well-written and especially instructive of Logotherapy applied to work-life.Frankl believed in the mission of this book. We highly recommend it. Reviewed by C.

Norton & Company New Y ork, London 447 pages 978-0-393-7054-9 The Neuroscience of Human Relationships presents a paradigm for under- standing psychodynamics and social development based in some of the latest find-ings about the brain. No longer can we conceive of ourselves as separate andisolated from others and the world. Neuroscience has found evidence that we areinterdependent and related at many levels. The brain and body evolved by inter-acting with the environment. The brain/body system develops over the lifespanthrough multiple layers of interacting systems. This interactive interdependencecan be traced down to the synapses between neurons, continually engaged witheach other, laying the foundation of all our experiences. Cozolino proposes ametaphor for social life: the social synapse, which assumes that our social life isencoded in the neurobiology of the brain. Interpersonal interaction takes place atthe social synapse. This book cogently describes this neurobiological theory of the development of human relationships. Included in every chapter are vivid case vignettes that il-lustrate the theory as applied to therapy. Part I presents the premises of neurobiol-ogy and traces its evolution over millions of years. Part II describes the structuresand functions of the social brain with an overview that helps to explain our emo-tionally charged social brain from neurons to brain systems and hemisphere later-ality. Part III shows how neuroplasticity gained from experience bridges the socialsynapse to influence the quality of attachments that we form in our social world.Part IV helps to clarify the theory with evidence about our visual system: the link-ing of gazes through face recognition, a wired-in process of the brain. Also cov-ered are mirror neurons and empathy. Part V delves into disorders of the socialbrain, explaining how early stress and trauma can interfere with the natural processof forming healthy, loving attachments leading to psychological problems. Fear,anxiety, and the inability to maintain healthy bonds can be traced to problems inthe early developmental process. Part VI provides ways to influence the disturbedsocial brain to bring about healing. Just as neurons have a three-messenger sys-tem from neurotransmitters to protein activation to gene transcription, so also dohumans have a three-messenger system: We receive information across our socialsynapse through interaction, much of which is unconscious. This input activatesmultiple neural networks to regulate homeostasis, reward, stress, and attachment.These reactions, in turn, stimulate new neuronal connections and brain growth toexpress as well as to create our social world. Mental illness understood in thisway, can be corrected by providing healing experiences that stimulate the humanmessenger system, while also stimulating the brain messenger system. At everylevel, change can occur. Having spent 15 years immersed in the field of neuroscience ourselves, we have found mounting evidence for the great promise that the neurobiological ap-proach can offer to our field. Psychotherapy can bring about change, not just inthoughts and feelings, but also in brain structures and functions. The Neuroscience of Human Relationships is a well-presented guide into this fascinating field. Co- zolino clearly shows how and why psychotherapists should be learning more aboutit. We highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to stay current with thenewest ways to stimulate human potential! Reviewed by C.

If I wasn't sold be-fore viewing this segment, he completely won me over with his self-disclosure andauthenticity. The chapter on couples included little bits of useful information aboutdoing couples therapy that therapist might not know unless they were extensivelysurveying current best practices. Seligman, in his affable and personable way, offers many useful tools to help you be even more effective with your clients. His positive psychology approachaugments work you are already doing with a positive emphasis that leads to morehappiness and life satisfaction. He discusses his web site that offers free tests to usewith your clients. I found them full of information and useful ideas. These ideasare free at Authentichappieness.org. Not only did I find the DVD well done, I was also impressed with Wyatt's in- terviewing skills and Seligman's personable presentation. I found myself likingboth Seligman and Watt and enjoyed their chemistry. Y es, Seligman is promotinghis work and his ideas, but much of what he is promoting is accessible for free. Hisopenness and genuine desire to be helpful to others comes through as does his hon-esty and authenticity. I recommend this DVD as a useful tool. It has given me muchto think about and many practical tools in an interesting format that was pleasant to watch. Reviewed by John D.

It is produced and edited withsuch skillful professionalism that stimulates interest and intrigue. The couples begin by telling what chemistry they had at the beginning of their relationship, and then discussing how they developed conflicts. Using short clipsin the introduction that portray clear relationship strengths and then learning howthey frustrated each other, provides an excellent understanding of the strengths andthe weaknesses of the couples you are about to see go through the process. Theskillful editing and producing of this DVD edits out any pauses and extraneousverbiage so that what you are left with is vivid, dynamic scenes. Each session keepsa steady intense pace, while explaining the theory in easy to understand ways. The first step in the theory involves structured dialogs that focus on the self while avoiding blame and criticism of the other. The second step is listening andreflecting back what was heard when your partner spoke. The third step has thecouple demonstrating empathy toward each other for what has been said. Thewhole process leads to developing genuine intimacy and avoiding the hang-ups ofpast conflicts. The final step is to guide the couples into stretching to a desired be-havior that helps heal. The behaviors are to be specific, measurable, achievable, rel-evant, and time-limited. The interventions are masterfully presented and then explained in clear terms that make the whole process understandable and reproducible. The relationshipexperts Jill Abramson, LCSW, Ben Cohen, Ph.D. CarolKramer Slepian LCSW and Steve Slepian LCSW present the theory with such clar-ity that it seems simple. Any experienced therapist will recognize the genuine ex-pertise and wisdom these people have as they explain and guide the couples andthe viewers attention to important concepts. The Couple's Workbook is designed for couples to use with guidelines for ex- ploring new methods of dialoging and understanding their conflicts. It will assistcouples to recognize new possibilities. But the material is more than merely ther-apeutic: It is also educational. Even non-trained leaders can apply these methods.I would recommend this excellent program, not only to therapists who want tolearn and use this process, but also to churches, synagogues, and mosques to as-sist their members to relate well and move through conflict to connection!

This DVD is an especially im-portant tool for these times when misunderstandings are widespread. Abi-Hashemis a Lebanese native and an experienced, articulate psychotherapist who is well-versed in Arab culture. The DVD begins with an interview given by Jon Carlson,followed by a therapy session with an Arab-American client, and finally a discus-sion between Abi-Hashem and Carlson that explicates key points. According to Abi-Hashem, Westerns have misconceptions about the Arab world. Generally, people fail to recognize that its rich cultural, religious, and geo-graphical range is wide and varied, ranging from the Eastern Mediterranean toNorth Africa and Pakistan. Each region is different, even in the sections that sharethe Arabic language or Muslim religion. Also, not all the people are Muslim. Infact, many religions are represented in this part of the world. Furthermore, coun-tries such as Iran are Persian, not Arabic. Thus, therapists should begin by be-coming acquainted with diversities and distinctions to overcome any stereotypesthey may hold. Abi-Hashem has straightforward advice for how to work with these clients. First is to be welcoming, warm, and friendly. Here we see evidence for the uni-versal importance of having a strong therapeutic relationship, a key nonspecificfactor of psychotherapy. Therapists can relax some of the rigid boundaries, evenwalking outside with clients to make them feel at ease and cared for. Therapistsshould inquire into background to help the client become more at one with it, andthis process begins by not setting arbitrary boundaries between the client's cultureand your own. Another helpful tip is to be willing to be a mentor: Sometimes clientsseek advice, and therapists should be willing to give it. These individuals often struggle with tensions between their culture of origin and culture of residence. Abi-Hashem distinguishes three levels of tension: intra-psychic, interpersonal, and intercultural. Therapy can intervene to resolve differ-ences at all three levels and find a harmonious identity that includes both cultures. In the therapy session, we see Abi-Hashem's warmth and sensitivity as he skill- fully works with a young, Catholic Jordanian male who is having conflicts with hisparents and with his own place in American culture. He experiences his father asoverly strict and critical of American \"bad\" influence and gets into heated argu-ments with his parents. On the other hand, the client objects when Americans referto him as Arab, considering it a racist epithet. Therapy guides the client to reinter-pret his parent's intentions, while also helping him to develop better coping stylesfor his personal identity, in his family interactions, and with the culture at large.Through his strong therapeutic alliance, Abi-Hashem helps this client explore andreconcile his tensions. Abi-Hashem concludes that ultimately, we all share in acommon humanity, and therapy helps to bring out its best qualities. By the end of the DVD, we have a clear understanding of how typical psychological problemstake on additional dimensions from cultural tensions, and we learn how to addressthem. We highly recommend this DVD for all therapists who are likely to treat thispopulation. Y ou will find unique insights into Arab-Americans, but also a broaderwisdom that can be generalized to working with many multi-cultural clients. Reviewed by C. Alexander Simpkins, Ph.D.Annellen M.

Y apko's devotion and commitment to hypnosis is clear: \"Hypnosis is themost overlooked and underutilized ofprocesses, but has the greatest poten-tial.\" During his concise introduction,Y apko clearly lays out the process hewill demonstrate: the interplay be-tween the client's inner exploration andthe of outside ideas fromthe therapist, which elicits new associ-ations that he then uses to further en-hance learning. In picking a subject, Y apko peppers the process with humor, \"Now is notthe time to work on the fact that youhave a more than casual relationshipwith sheep.\" Throughout the session itis inspiring to see him succeed in keep-ing the mood upbeat while being re-spectful of MC's depressed affect. MCwas teary during most of the hypnosis. During the intake, Y apko quickly focused in on the problem and its solu-tion by asking pointed questions. Ifone can savor ones learning from thisDVD by repeated viewings, one cancatch the three times he seeds the ideasby Socratic questions which he laterasks her to change her troublesomeperspective. These ideas prefigure theDVD REVIEW three themes of Y apko's suggestions:Not doing what someone wants is notthe same as payback; continuing tothink of someone as great even if thereare periods of difficulty; and one mo-ment in time does not define a rela-tionship. Y apko starts the hypnosis induction using what is familiar to MC, meditat-ing and focusing inward on her breath.He quickly adds suggestions of changeand learning: \"Y ou can discover thatthe firm lines that define experiencebecome less firm...and when you getabsorbed and focused it makes it somuch easier to learn something...\"True to his words in the introduction,\"Integrating hypnosis with clinicalpractice is about creating a contextwhere a person has the opportunity todiscover aspects of themselves thatwere previously unfamiliar,\" Y apko art-fully uses MC's experience with herson and mother to make it clear thatshe already \"demonstrated a sophisti-cated skill... of setting aside what youdon't feel so good about in a relation-ship in order to describe the fact thatyou still love this person.\" Near the end of the hypnosis, Y apko informs the client, \"In just a mo-ment I'll ask you what you are experi-encing right now and each word yousay can deepen your experience\".Y apko is checking the new associationformed, and then he cleverly uses themto fortify the learning. In this DVD hefurther asks about a smile he noticesand expertly ends MC's experience ona cheerful note. I give this DVD an un-qualified recommendation for thera-pists at any level who want to leavetheir depressed clients smiling.

Erickson Foundation, Inc. This DVD is a clinical demonstration of Outcome-Informed Clinical Work by Scott Miller working with an audience volunteer. He starts with information abouthis method, and states that early change in a session is predicative of later change.The session continues with the volunteer filling out a beginning-of-sessionform. (This and the end-of-session forms can be downloaded fromwww.talkingcure.com .) There are four items on this scale for the client to rate: in- dividually, interpersonally, socially, and overall. The conclusion was that thingswere going generally okay with the client, but that she had a specific concern. The client's basic issue was that \"Sloth\" was making it hard for her to get things done at home, but not at her office and in her work. Sloth convinced her at homethat there is too much to do. Miller listens attentively, and takes notes throughoutthe session. Miller uses exaggeration, and asking her what she does to keep Slothunder control. One thing that helps is telling her mother and some friends. One crucial question was, \"What prevents him from coming to the office now?\" The answer was that her work in the office is structured and Sloth is not invited in. She hears Miller in his suggestion that before leaving her office, she plan tochange her vision of what will happen at home. She works out a way to do this forherself. The client stated that she had a problem with ADD. Was this an excuse or an explanation? In response the client felt this needed to be evaluated. Towards the end of the session Miller does his standard practice of taking some time to think about what to do next, and urges the client to also think about whathas been going on. Miller then asks the client to fill out the end-of-session form,which has four parts: relationship (did you feel heard?); goals and topics (werethey worked on?); approach or method (was the therapist's approach good?); andoverall (overall satisfaction, and was anything missed?). There appeared to be some satisfaction with the session, and the client was going to continue to work on this concern. My only critique of the session was when Miller started to do Narrative Ther- apy work with the client's externalization of the controlling \"Sloth\" in her life andthen went to other things. I would have liked to have seen him continue in that di-rection. The main message an observer gets from watching this demonstration isthe ease and usefulness of the beginning- and end-of-session evaluation instru-ments. Download them and use them with your clients to obtain effective feedbackso that you can function in a more informed fashion. It is always a pleasure towatch Scott Miller working, and I recommend this DVD.

Erickson Foundation Inc. Phoenix, Arizona www.erickson-foundation.org BT08 DVD7 This DVD masterfully demonstrates how brief therapy can incorporate hyp- nosis through a clinical case presentation. Lankton creatively displays conversa-tional inductions, as well as more formal induction methods, both woven into aclinical interview of brief therapy. This DVD appeals to beginners and experiencedpractitioners alike, from the novice who wants to see how hypnosis is done to themore advanced practitioner who can appreciate the skillful expertise. The demon-stration also could be used for teaching students a number of practical aspects ofhypnosis. Because it is so well done, the viewer may feel invited to gain personalwisdom from watching the work the client accomplishes. This DVD shows Lankton's mastery of hypnosis, brief therapy, and clinical work. Before Lankton begins therapy with the subject, Myra, he explains the earlyhistory of brief therapy and how entwined Milton H. Erickson was in the earliestroots of the discipline. His information is succinct, informative, and useful espe-cially for understanding what comes next in the demonstration that weaves hyp-notic devices into a brief therapy interview. Perhaps one of the things that would be the most useful to viewers of all lev- els of expertise is the way he demonstrates weaving different hypnotic devices intothe interview by using Myra's words and experiences, providing a wonderfuldemonstration of conversational induction! While remaining sensitive to her im-agery, he gives her experiences that you know will help her to have more optionsand become able to achieve her goals. Even long-time practitioners will appreci-ate how skillfully and seamlessly Lankton weaves the information he is offeringinto a trance induction that incorporates Myra's imagery with slight variations, toproduce a positive trance that is helpful to her on multiple levels. Lankton proves himself to be resourceful, utilizing information Myra offers to apply several different types of trance deepening methods. These techniques mightlook like separate interventions, and could be thought of in that way, yet the over-all effect is to deepen the ongoing trance as well as to intervene in specific areas.For instance, Lankton has Myra visualize an early scene when she first noticedhaving difficulty letting people be close to her. The technique looks simple enoughfor a novice to employ. But then he masterfully deepens the trance with more for-mal trance induction procedures. He sprinkles factual information about trance andthe changes that people typically go through physically in a way that makes youwant to use trance often because of the obvious benefits. For those people who already like Lankton's work, this is a wonderful exam- ple to learn from and use for teaching. For folks who haven't experienced Lankton'sblend of humor, sophisticated language skills, and adept manner of demonstratingcare for and about the client, you have a wonderful opportunity to experience areal master at work.

Trying to program a computer that is not fully optimized isvery hard. GR: How can this level of inte- gration of neuroscience and psy-chotherapy become accessible topsychotherapists who do not cur-rently have this available to them? DA: For complex people, they can certainly send them to someone likeme to get a neuropsychiatric evaluationto see if this person's brain is intact orneeds help before you embark on aplan. That is for the complex people inyour practice but not necessarily forevery patient. I think all psychotherapists should have brain-system training. It is therare mental health program that actu- ally teaches any meaningful neuro-science, and ultimately if you're doingpsychotherapy, you're trying to changesomeone's brain. Y ou can developskills to go after neurological systems,but first you have to know about it. It'snot hard. In my book, Change Your Brain, Change Your Life ,\" every thera- pist who reads the book can understandit and apply it in their practice. We'vecreated a brain system checklist. Basedon how people answer the questions orhow their spouse would answer thequestions on them, you can develop anidea of what their scan might look like,what their vulnerabilities might be, andthen target treatment to the checklist. GR: So, not everybody has to ac- tually receive a scan to benefit fromsome of the concepts of which youare speaking and writing? DA: Absolutely. GR: The field of psychiatry has shifted toward what they describe asbiological psychiatry and psy-chopharmacology. What are yourthoughts about that direction and inthe treatment of emotional and cog-nitive difficulties?

Bio-logical treatment is putting someone ona gluten-free, casein-free diet - a to-tally biological intervention. We don'tdo that. Getting someone to exercise isbiological intervention. We don't dothat. What psychiatrists do is say if pa-tients have a particular symptom clus-ter, \"I think they should take Abilify\"or they have this other symptom clus-ter, they should take Lamictal and Abil-ify or if they have this other symptomcluster and take Lamictal and Abilifyand Lexapro and Ritalin.

What isthe underlying biology? GR: Right.DA: I get identified with brain scans because I'm noted for that. Butthat's only one piece of a biologicalevaluation. Y ou should know abouttheir hormone levels, their family his-tory, their diet, and their level of exer-cise.

The incidence ofmental illness and Alzheimer's diseaseradically goes up if you don't have con-trol over your eating. Food can be yourbiggest poison or your best medicine.Two-thirds of our country now is over-weight or obese. It's really quite a na-tional crisis. And the incidence ofbeing overweight or obese in childrenhas gone up from 4% in 1982 to 32%today. It' is horrifying. It is a bio-psy-cho-socio-spiritual problem. Y ou reallyhave to think about it like that, withinspirituality, because people rarely haveany connection with what their moti-v a t i o nt ob eh e a l t h yi s . GR: Going back to the pharma- cology, do you think that the med-ications being used can have a toxiceffect on brain function? DA: I'm sure of it, though not all of them. Some of them really helpnicely to balance brain function, butyou have to give it to the right brain.We just published a study on stimu-lants. We did two SPECT scans onpeople, one at rest and one the next daywhen they tried to do a concentrationtask. What we found is people who de-activate their frontal lobes from rest toconcentration get less activity in theirfrontal lobes, and 80% of the time theyhave a positive response to a stimulant.If, on the other hand, you activate yourfrontal lobes, 80% of the time you havea bad response to a stimulant. Y ou need to tailor the medicine to the brain type. Now having said that,when I was in my psychiatric trainingXanax came out onto the market, andso I used a lot of it until I started look-ing at people's brains, because Xanaxbrains look like alcohol brains and it'snot a happy thing. My goal in life has really shifted from just decreasing your symptoms todecreasing your symptoms and im-proving your brain function. If I de-crease your symptoms with Xanax, butI don't improve your brain function, Idiscourage healthy brain function. GR: You are going to be con- ducting a workshop as well as hold-ing some seminars at the Evolutionof Psychotherapy conference. Whatwould you like for the attendees totake from your workshops? DA: Well, my hope is that they will get a completely new paradigm forreally integrating a bio-psycho-socio-spiritual model using the work that wedo, and learn how to apply it in theiroffice the next day. And I hope they getreally curious enough to learn moreabout it. GR: On a personal note, what would you identify as a pivotal pointin you own journey? DA: The biggest one for me was in 1987 when I was the chief of mentalhealth at Fort Irwin in the MojaveDesert. We had an old Autogenbiofeedback temperature trainer and Ihad one lecture in biofeedback at mytraining. We got it out and played withit and figured out how to make it work.We taught people to warm their hands,and when you learn to warm yourhands your stress goes down. It is avery interesting physiological re-sponse. And when I learned about it, itwas really that ah-ha moment, that Ican do a better assessment for my pa-tients - physical assessments on theirbodies and their brains. That's where Ilearned about neuro-feedback. If coulddo better assessments, then I couldteach them to change their own physi-ology without using medication. Icould teach them skills, not just givethem pills. In 1991, when I went to myfirst lecture on brain SPECT imaging.I immediately got the importance of it. And then getting my own brain scanned, I realized,\" I want a betterbrain.\" Even though I had never donedrugs and did not drink, my brain wasnot all that healthy and I didn't have ahealthy lifestyle. I was drinking dietsoda like she was my best friend andnot exercising and thinking I could getby on four hours of sleep at night. Be-cause of that scan, I started to clean upmy own life, and felt better andyounger and my brain looked betterand younger. It just changed every-thing. And my mission in life now is not just about treating mental illness, it'sabout optimizing brain functions. GR: Perfect. Thank you. AMEN continued from page 26 "}
