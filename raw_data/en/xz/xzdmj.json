Clerkship Directors in Emergency Medicine 901 N. Washington AvenueLansing, Telephone: (517) 485-5484 Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students is to assist medical students throughout their emer- gency medicine clerkship. Although the target audience for this manual is primarily junior and senior medical students, we believe that emergency medicine interns and off-service residents will benefit from the majority of the topics reviewed. Our goal is to produce a high-quality,professional guide that highlights the uniqueness of our specialty. This guide should provide the reader with a detail-oriented approach to think- ing like an emergency physician\u2014essentially a \"how to\" manual. ThePrimer can be considered a supplement to the many high-quality emer- gency medicine texts currently available. However, different from these, the Primer focuses on aspects of our specialty that are often overlooked or underrepresented in traditional textbooks. Before the development of this Primer , a comprehensive manual such as this was not available to the masses of medical students across the country. Good luck on your emer-gency medicine rotation.

Formal recognition by the rest of tradi- tional medicine came nearly two decades later, but for those who under- stood the vision when it first appeared, four decades of service is the right number. As you prepare for your clerkship, please recognize our chosen specialty has several gifts in store for you. First, its faculty and residents recognize the responsibility we have to train you to understand and operate in ourrealm. Undergraduate medical education is a serious pursuit for emer- gency physicians, and your clerkship director holds a position of esteem in the department. We understand the potential impact of early inter-vention as well as or better than any other practitioner. In education, a shared truth or corrected perception can last a lifetime, and this is what we plan to offer each of you who spend time with us. In addition, we offer a unique contribution to your medical education. We are not trying to sell our specialty to you or trying to \"convert\" you from your chosen direction toward ours. What we have to offer is a uniqueenvironment and an opportunity to practice fundamental skills to which you have had limited exposure thus far in medical school. The most important of these is acute care decisionmaking. That is a unique mo-ment, usually unanticipated, when a patient forces you to make a series of decisions surrounded by uncertainty but of great importance none- theless. Time is not your friend, and you quickly find there is nothing\"cookbook\" about having a well-organized and thoughtful plan of ap- proach in such a circumstance. You will not only exercise new regions of the brain, you will also get to use your hands when working with us.Technical skills and accompanying virtuosity are critical elements in the day-in, day-out practice of emergency medicine. Many of these skills\u2014 vascular access, airway management, lumbar puncture and suturing\u2014are all a part of a reasonable skill set for a senior medical student. Commitment to learning these skills can be highly variable in medical school, and opportunities to practice them may be limited. However, inthe emergency department, you should have the opportunity to put them to use every day, just as we do. Lastly, think of working in an environment where more than 115 mil- lion undifferentiated patients come to see you or your equivalent over the course of each year. Patients' illnesses and injuries are not alwaysForewordvi \u0083 Forewordwhat they seem to be, and you will learn to respect that statement like never before. The approach to unraveling a voiced complaint on the partof a patient while thinking about all of the worst possibilities of potential origin is a very different way of thinking than most of your experiences to date. We believe that you will find this experience will serve you well,both with us and beyond. Our specialty interacts with every other specialty, often at the raw inter- face of the unplanned admission on a 24-hour, 7-day clock. We knowthat most of you completing this clerkship will not choose emergency medicine, although more and more students do each year. We are excit- ed for your future careers in primary care, surgery, pediatrics, medicinesubspecialties, and others, but we know that we will see you again in one guise or another. Therefore, it is important to us that you are well treat- ed, remember what goes on here, and leave with some degree of under-standing and a modicum of respect and appreciation. Therefore, you should expect to be treated well but with discipline and high expecta- tions. One clear gesture in our effort to make your experience with us most rewarding is this Primer . Read it completely early in your experience with us, reread it as you see a wide variety of patients, and use it to help orderand integrate the other teachings we will send your way. We are proud of what we do and the safety net role we play in our nation's health care system. We welcome you while you are with us and look forward to along-term relationship, day and night, no matter what specialty you may choose. Take care of yourselves and the people around you. Glenn C.

However, in the house of medicine, the formal specialty of emergency medicine is still relatively young\u2014measured in decades. Emergency medicine developed differently from perhaps many of the other more traditional medical and surgical specialties. In the case of emergency medicine, public demand more than scientific inquiry fu-eled the formation and growth of the specialty. In the 1950s and 1960s, with more physicians seeking specialty training, the number of general practitioners began to decline. At that time, hospitals were becoming moremodernized and technologically advanced. Ultimately, these factors, along with the changing demographic and social conditions of the post-World War II era, led to an increased public reliance on hospital emergency de-partments for the provision of unanticipated medical care. Unfortunate- ly, a uniform system for providing high-quality emergency care did not exist. At that time, junior medical and surgical house officers staffed manyhospital emergency departments with little or no attending supervision. Most of these physicians did not have the necessary clinical skills to prop- erly care for the increasing complexity of cases seeking medical attention.It was also becoming evident that the physician staffing patterns were inadequate to keep up with the ever-increasing patient volume. Change began in the early 1960s when a group of physicians left their respective practices and devoted their full-time practice to the care of emergency department patients. In 1961, four physicians, led by James Mills, MD, started the first full-time emergency medicine practice at Al-exandria Hospital in Virginia. That same year, a group of 23 community physicians began providing around-the-clock emergency department cov- erage at Pontiac General Hospital in Michigan. By the late 1960s, hun-dreds of \"emergency physicians\" were in practice throughout the country. In 1968, John Wiegenstein, MD, and seven other full-time emergency physicians founded the American College of Emergency Physicians(ACEP), our specialty's first professional medical society. Later that same year, during the first national meeting, ACEP was recognized as the na- tional emergency medicine organization. The American Academy ofEmergency Medicine (AAEM), a new professional society, was founded in 1993 to promote fair and equitable practice environments for emer- gency physicians. The first emergency medicine residency-training program was established at the University of Cincinnati in 1970. That same year, the University2 \u0083 Introduction to the Specialty of Emergency MedicineOur specialty represents one of the few medical specialties that hasshown a consistent and steadyincrease in the number of residencypositions offered in the nationalresidency matching program,representing 6.3% of all PGY-1positions filled in the 2008 match.Association of Emergency Medical Service (UA/EMS) was founded by medical school faculty practicing emergency medicine, followed by theformation of the Society of Teachers in Emergency Medicine (STEM) in 1975. These two organizations merged in 1989 to form the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), our specialty's current premieracademic organization promoting research and education. In 1974, the Emergency Medicine Residents Association (EMRA) was formed. By 1981, there were 56 emergency medicine residency-training programs acrossthe country. As of 2008, there are 143 accredited allopathic and 37 ac- credited osteopathic emergency medicine residency training programs in the United States. Formed in 1989, the Council of Emergency Medi-cine Residency Directors (CORD) is an educational and scientific orga- nization whose purpose is to improve the quality of emergency medical care and to establish and maintain high standards of excellence in emer-gency medicine training programs. One of the first steps toward formal recognition of our specialty occurred in 1973 when emergency medicine was granted a provisional sectioncouncil seat in the American Medical Association House of Delegates; permanent status was granted in 1975. In 1976, the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) was formed. Thereafter, ACEP and ABEMembarked on the process of establishing primary board certification sta- tus for the specialty of emergency medicine. In 1979, the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) formally recognized ABEM. Ten years later,in 1989, ABMS granted ABEM primary board status, thus formally recog- nizing emergency medicine as the 23rd primary medical specialty. The emergence of osteopathic physicians in the field of emergency med- icine occurred in 1975 when the American College of Osteopathic Emer- gency Physicians became an affiliate college of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). By 1978, the American Osteopathic Board of Emer-gency Medicine (AOBEM) was established as an affiliate specialty board of the AOA. The following year, the first osteopathic emergency medi- cine residency-training program was established at the Philadelphia Col-lege of Osteopathic Medicine. Over the last 30 years, the growth of emergency medicine has continued at an extraordinary pace. The future of our specialty is especially brightas we continue to attract high-quality medical students interested in pur- suing a career in emergency medicine. Our specialty represents one of the few medical specialties that has shown a consistent and steady in-crease in the number of residency positions offered in the national resi- dency matching program, representing 6.3% of all PGY-1 positions offered in the 2008 match (National Resident Matching Program, 2008). Emer- gency medicine is now the fourth most common specialty that US grad- uating medical students choose to enter, behind internal medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics (Newton et al., 2003). Collectively, across thecountry, emergency medicine residency-training programs graduate ap- proximately 1,500 emergency physicians each year. In 2008, the SAEM's Board of Directors approved the formation of the Academy of Clerkship Directors in Emergency Medicine (CDEM). CDEM consists of medical student educators who are committed to enhancing undergraduate medical education within our specialty. Suggested Reading Newton DA, Grayson MS.

Traditionally, the majority of medical schools offer clinical emergency medicine rotations for senior medical students who have completed their core third-year rotations. Although some schools provide an elective or selective opportunity, others, approximately one third, provide a manda- tory clinical experience for medical students. As an acute care rotation, theemergency medicine clerkship will provide you with the opportunity to draw from all of your past clinical experiences when caring for patients. Rotating through a busy emergency department can be a daunting task for any medical student. New residents, faculty, ancillary staff, or even perhaps a new hospital can all add to the unease associated with starting a clinical rotation. The emergency department is at times chaotic, withnumerous unexpected emergent patient presentations and distractions. Our specialty operates in an environment that is different from both the ambulatory care and inpatient settings; our doors never close. The pa-tient volume, high acuity, and varied pathology all add to the challenge of practicing emergency medicine. In addition, the shift work scheduling of students, residents, and faculty can lend itself to educational challeng-es. On the one hand, you may have limited continuity with your precep- tor; on the other hand, your clinical schedule usually affords you the opportunity to work with many different residents and attending physi-cians. Every shift is different and can bring with it a wealth of educational and patient care-related opportunities. Because of the hectic and some- times frenzied pace of the emergency department, it is important to un-derstand your role while caring for patients. Many clinical rotations allow a senior medical student to function in a role similar to that of a junior house officer with some additional guidance and supervision. In the emer-gency department, you will have the opportunity and responsibility to provide patient care in a structured environment under the direct super- vision of a senior emergency medicine resident or attending physician. As in other clinical rotations, it is imperative to understand your limita- tions. First and foremost, remember that your attending physician is ulti- mately in charge of and responsible for the care the patient receives. Thatbeing said, it is still likely that as a \"student doctor,\" you may examine a patient before the senior emergency medicine resident or attending physi- cian does. This level of autonomy also brings with it inherent responsibil-ity. If during any of your patient encounters, you feel that your patient is \"sick or potentially sick\" (e.g., abnormal vital signs, shortness of breath,Every shift is different and can bring with it a wealth of educational andpatient care-related opportunities. Every patient that you encounter should be treated as you would wanta family member treated.The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 5chest pain, abdominal pain with peritoneal findings, change in mental status), alert your supervisor immediately. In addition, certain aspects ofthe physical examination are usually performed in the presence of resi- dents or faculty. Find out whether your clerkship director has a policy or guideline regarding the participation of medical students in performingpelvic, rectal, breast, and genitourinary examinations. Throughout your medical school training, you have performed countless histories and physical examinations (H&PEs). Typically, it may take 45 to60 minutes to perform a comprehensive H&PE. Because the nature of emergency medicine is a complaint driven rather than disease-based spe- cialty, most patients can be evaluated in a focused fashion. Focusing yourevaluation to the presenting chief complaint is one of the cornerstones of emergency medicine practice. That being said, this task is not as easy as it appears because of the ingrained nature of the comprehensive ap-proach to the H&PE. Realize that by focusing your patient evaluation and by being thorough, you may actually increase your efficiency when car- ing for patients. Undoubtedly, your emergency medicine clerkship shouldprovide you with countless opportunities to further your evaluation and management skills, regardless of your intended career path. Another particularly important aspect of your emergency medicine clerk- ship is the sign in-sign out transition of care. This is the time when one shift ends and the next begins. The attending physician completing his or her shift signs out any outstanding patient-related issues to the in-coming attending: pending test results, patients that need to be reevalu- ated, dispositions that need to be made, and the like. As a student rotating through the emergency department, the shift change can be a complexand confusing time. Most physicians are trying to tie up a number of loose ends during the last 15 or so minutes of their shifts. Therefore, it is a good idea to try to complete all patient-related tasks promptly whenyou are nearing the end of your shift, especially if your shift coincides with that of the attending. Your clerkship director may have a policy regarding your sign in-sign out responsibilities. If not, we offer the fol-lowing general guidelines to ensure a smooth transfer of patient care at the sign in-sign out transition: \u0084Try to complete all patient-related duties before the completion of your shift. \u0084Always inform the attending physician before you leave the emer-gency department at the conclusion of your shift. This will help toensure that all patient-related matters have been addressed.If during any of your patient encounters you feel that yourpatient is \"sick or potentially sick,\"alert your supervisor immediately. Tips for a Successful Rotation \u0084Use your resources; if you have any questions, ask the nurses, the senior emergency medicin e resident, or the attending physician. \u0084Be on time for your clinical shifts. \u0084Ask for help early on if needed. \u0084Always be professional in your interactions with patients and staff. \u0084Always be a patient advocate and offer compassionate care. \u0084Read about interesting cases. \u0084Contact the site director or clerkship director if you anticipate any scheduling conflicts or if you have any questions.6 \u0083 Introduction to the Emergency Medicine Clerkship\u0084At the end of your shift, do not sign out to an incoming student un- less specifically instructed to do so by the senior emergency medicineresident or attending physician. \u0084When you start a clinical shift, evaluate the next new patient to beseen. While rotating through the emergency department, you may see atti- tudes and behaviors that may be foreign to your own personal value system. You should deal with these as a professional. Every patient thatyou encounter should be treated as you would want a family member treated. You should also treat all staff members (e.g., physicians, nurses, patient care assistants) with respect, and likewise, you should expect thesame in return. While rotating through the emergency department, con- sider the tips for a successful rotation shown on the previous page. Keep in mind the added level of responsibility expected of you through- out this rotation. Communicate effectively with both your patients and the staff members involved with their care. Pay close attention to the needs of your patients because you may be in a position to greatly affecttheir care and the perception of the care provided in the emergency de- partment. Follow your patients closely. Are they comfortable? Are their needs being met? What can you do to further assist with their care? Re-member, you are an important part of the health care team. Lastly, if you are contemplating a career in emergency medicine, this rotation is a great opportunity to see if our specialty is a good fit for you.Talk to the faculty and residents and seek out the clerkship director and the residency director. Alternatively, if you are interested in any of the other medical or surgical specialties, an emergency medicine rotation isa great opportunity to expose you to a wide variety of patients and an opportunity to perform basic procedures under direct supervision. Most of all, enjoy the experience. Suggested Reading Additional information regarding emergency medicine can be found on the Websites of national organizations.

Clerkship goals and objectives are often developed on the basis of a combination of perceived educational need, faculty or institutional resources, and proposed national curricular guide- lines. The clerkship objectives should be available to all residents andfaculty members directly involved in medical student education. In its accreditation standards, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) further describes the educational program for the MD degreeand the rationale for the development of educational objectives (LCME, 2007). LCME is recognized by the US Department of Health as the ac- crediting authority for medical education programs that lead to the MDdegree in the United States. Your emergency medicine clerkship goals and objectives will provide you with a framework for the clinical and nonclinical expectations that havebeen set for you by the clerkship director. In general, the majority of your rotation objectives will be met through direct patient care. Under- standing the goals and objectives of your emergency medicine rotationwill allow you to better understand the expectations that your clerkship director has set for you. Taken one step further, the achievement of your rotation goals and objectives will serve as the basis for your summativeevaluation at the conclusion of your rotation and assist the clerkship director in determining your final clerkship grade. Reviewing your rota- tion goals and objectives should not be viewed as a mere formality. In 2006, the Fourth Year Medical Student National Curriculum Guide was published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine (Manthey et al., 2006). This comprehensive curricular guide was developed by a task force repre-senting the six national emergency medicine organizations. The curricu- lar guide outlines the objectives and core educational topics that are central to our specialty. The rotation objectives are presented in a com-petency-based format modeled after the six core competencies developed by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), the organization that oversees and regulates graduate medical educationtraining programs in the United States: \u0084Patient care \u0084Medical knowledge8 \u0083 Emergency Medicine Clerkship Goals and ObjectivesRegardless of your intended career path, an emergency medicine ro-tation can expose you to interest-ing and diverse pathology.\u0084 Practice-based learning and improvement \u0084Systems-based practice \u0084Professionalism \u0084Interpersonal and communication skills Although some objectives could logically fall under multiple compe- tencies, for the purpose of organization and clarity, each is placed in only one category. An introduction to the core competencies is dis- cussed in detail in the introduction to the core competencies sectionof the Primer . Although the national task force recommendations are not requirements, it is likely that the objectives of your clerkship will reflect some of these recommendations. Remember, your clerkship goalsand objectives are by nature designed to ensure that all students, re- gardless of intended career path, have a broad exposure to emergency medicine. Common clerkship goals and objectives include a list of coreclinical skills that a student will be expected to complete or in which a student will be able to demonstrate some measure of proficiency by the conclusion of the rotation. These can include, but are not limitedto, the following: \u0084Performing a complaint-directed H&PE \u0084Developing a case-specific differential diagnosis \u0084Presenting cases in a clear and concise fashion \u0084Demonstrating an understanding of the use and interpretation ofcommonly ordered diagnostic studies \u0084Developing and assisting with implementation of appropriate case management plans \u0084Demonstrating an adequate fund of knowledge \u0084Demonstrating proficiency with basic procedural skills Because of the unique nature of emergency medicine, additional spe- cialty-specific objectives may include evaluating the undifferentiatedpatient, recognizing an immediate life-threatening illness, being aware of worst-case diagnoses, and undertaking proper patient disposition and outpatient follow-up plans. Furthermore, specific objectives maylist expectations regarding student-patient encounters, such as evalu- ating patients with classic chief complaints (i.e., abdominal pain, head- ache, chest pain, shortness of breath, and back pain) or performing aspecific number of selected procedures [e.g., arterial blood gas insertion of intravenous (IV) catheters, laceration repair, phlebotomy]. It is useful for the student to periodically review the clerk-ship objectives during the course of the rotation and reflect on his or her areas of achievement as well as on any area requiring further atten- tion. As a medical student, you should also consider your own person-al goals and objectives. Individual goals should be straightforward and may be as simple as improving electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation skills, developing proficiency in phlebotomy, learning how to clinical-ly clear the cervical spine of a patient with neck pain, and the like. Regardless of your intended career path, an emergency medicine rota- tion can expose you to interesting and diverse pathology. In summary, review your emergency medicine clerkship goals and ob- jectives at the beginning of the rotation. Discuss your personal goals with your supervising physicians so that they may assist you in achiev-ing them. Understanding what is expected of you is the first step in making your clinical experience the best that it can be.The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 9Suggested Reading Liaison Committee on Medical Education.

The im- portance of emergency medicine education at the undergraduate level is acknowledged by its inclusion in the LCME Educational Objectives(revised, June 2007), which state \"educational opportunities must be available in multidisciplinary content areas such as emergency medi- cine.\" Emergency medicine offers a truly unique educational experience for med- ical students for several reasons. First, there is an endless stream of pa- tients. In recent years, more than 115 million visits were made annuallyto emergency departments across the country; half of these visits were categorized as urgent or emergent in acuity. These figures continue to rise, with annual emergency department visits increasing by 26% in thepast decade (Institute of Medicine, 2006). Second, the emergency depart- ment provides health care for patients presenting at any time for any reason. Patient presentations range from the unexpected, life-threateningemergency to the more routine primary care problems encountered by patients with limited access to the health care system. Third, learners are exposed to patients with an undifferentiated complaint instead of a pre-liminary or confirmed diagnosis. More than 25% of all emergency depart- ment patient encounters present with seven common chief complaints (Nawar et al., 2007): \u0084Abdominal pain \u0084Headache \u0084Shortness of breath \u0084Vomiting Finally, because the doors of the emergency department never close, un- scheduled health care is provided to all regardless of age, ethnicity, eco-nomic status, or the ability to speak English. Our specialty truly provides a safety net to the millions of under- or uninsured people in this country.The emergency department pro- vides health care for patients pre-senting at any time for anyreason. . . . Our specialty trulyprovides a safety net the mil-lions of under- or uninsuredpeople in this country.The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 11Because of the unique population, pathology, and patient presentations, you are likely to encounter clinical scenarios with which you wouldotherwise have little or no direct contact with in other health care set- tings. You should view all of your patient encounters as educational opportunities. Where else could you encounter the acutely poisonedpatient; interact with prehospital care providers; manage acute trauma; encounter environmental emergencies such as hypothermia, frostbite, or burns; treat an acute stroke or myocardial infarction; provide obstet-rical care; all in the same shift? Your emergency medicine clerkship will help reinforce your medical interviewing and physical examination skills. Taken one step further, you will have an opportunity to focusand hone your ability to develop a case-specific differential diagnosis and implement patient management plans. Each of these and many other topics will be discussed in more detail in other sections of thePrimer . The emergency department can also provide you with procedural oppor- tunities that are likely unparalleled in other clinical rotations. In a typi-cal rotation, you may have an opportunity to perform phlebotomy, insert peripheral IV catheters or nasogastric tubes (NGTs), perform a lumbar puncture or arthrocentesis, and repair simple lacerations. From an edu-cational standpoint, the ability to perform a particular procedure or ex- ercise a clinical skill is but one facet of your development as a young physician. With repetition, proficiency in procedural skills often devel-ops over time. However, it is often of equal if not greater importance, especially early in your training, to attain the understanding of why and when, not just how. This understanding should be a part of your emer- gency department clerkship. Another key aspect of your education is to further enhance your ability to understand how certain diagnostic studies are used in the emergen-cy department. By the completion of this rotation, you should have the opportunity to interpret dozens of radiographs [chest and abdomi- nal plain films, computed tomography (CT) scans and ultrasounds],commonly ordered laboratory studies (basic metabolic profiles, com- plete blood counts, hepatic functions, ABGs, and cardiac enzymes), and 12-lead ECGs. In addition, you will work with a number of medical professionals who can help you further develop certain intangible clinical skills, such as multitasking, time management, conflict resolution, and role modelingof professional behavior. These skills are best learned on the job by work- ing with seasoned clinicians. This is also true for developing your case presentation skills and learning how to best interact with your consult-ants and other members of the health care team. No matter how well your emergency medicine rotation is organized, much of what you get out of it is going to be based on what you put into it. Setindividual goals based on your career interests. Supplement your clinical experience by reading about common chief complaints or certain ill- nesses that you encounter. Our goal is to help you along the path tobecoming the best physician you are capable of being. The emergency department affords you with a wealth of clinical and educational oppor- tunities.

Throughout medical school, you will encounter patients in many clinical arenas: the inpatient wards, the public health clinic, the private office, the hospital outpatient clinic, and of course the emer- gency department. Although medicine at its core involves taking care of patients, the approach and sequence of steps involved in caring for pa- tients will be different depending on the health care setting in which theyare encountered. When evaluating a patient, the health care provider (nurse, medical student, resident, or attending) needs to develop an ap- proach tailored to the specific health care setting and available resources. Think of the ambulatory care and hospital outpatient clinic setting. In this clinical venue, unexpected emergencies occur; however, they are few and far between. The acuity level is low, with 1% of patient encoun-ters requiring referral to the emergency department or for hospital ad- mission (Middleton et al., 2007, Cherry et al., 2007). Some patients will require diagnostic studies (laboratory tests or diagnostic imaging). Fortu-nately in this setting, the majority of these are routine, and most are obtained electively. Many patients requiring diagnostic studies will need to be referred to an off-site laboratory, diagnostic imaging center, or hos-pital to undergo testing. Therefore, the results of many of these diagnos- tic studies are not available to the ordering physician for days. Although many private offices and outpatient clinics have a system in place allow-ing unscheduled walk-in visits, the overwhelming majority of patient visits are scheduled, and patients are cared for on a first-come-first-served basis. When patients are sick, or when the office is closed, patients arereferred to the emergency department. In addition, the majority of pa- Case Study Consider the patient with an elevated blood pressure measurement who is referred to the emergenc y department for evaluation from a local health clinic. The patient is asymptomatic, without complaints o f headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath. His repeat blood pressure measurement in the emergenc y department is 186/98 mmHg. In such a case, a targeted H&PE and selected diagnostic work up will b e needed to exclude any acute complications of elevated blood pressure such as the involvement of ke y target organs (i.e., eyes, brain, heart, lungs, and kidneys). The goal is not necessarily to establish baselin e laboratory values, to obtain diagnostic studies for future comparison or even to necessarily normalize th e blood pressure at this time.14 \u0083 Differences Between the Emergency Department, the Office, and the Inpatient SettingThe emergency department has both an ethical and legal obliga-tion to evaluate every patient whopresents for care to determinewhether he or she has a medicalemergency, regardless of ability topay for health care.tients seeking medical care in an ambulatory care or outpatient clinic setting are established patients compared with the emergency depart-ment, where the overwhelming number of physician-patient encoun- ters are new visits. Traditionally, approximately half of all outpatient encounters are made to primary care physicians, with many of these visits being for preven- tive care. The most common reasons for a patient to visit an outpatient clinic include progress visit, general medical examination, routine pre-natal care, cough, and sore throat. Together, these types of patient visits account for 20% of all outpatient clinic visits (Middleton et al., 2007). By contrast, the emergency department provides care to the acutely ill orinjured. In the emergency department, nursing triage guidelines are de- signed to ensure that more seriously ill patients are cared for first. The acuity level is also much greater than the ambulatory care or outpatientclinic setting. Across the country, approximately 12% of all emergency department patient encounters require hospital admission (Nawar et al., 2007), with 16% of patients admitted to a critical care bed. Anecdotally,high-acuity, high-volume emergency departments will admit 20% to 25% of cases to the hospital. Compared with the outpatient setting, a greater number of emergency department patient encounters require a diagnos-tic workup. This may include laboratory tests or advanced imaging tech- niques such as CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The majority of diagnostic tests performed in the emergency department bydesign provide results to the ordering physician within minutes to hours. Although some patients will present to the emergency department with complaints that could otherwise be cared for in an ambulatory care set-ting, many unexpected emergencies such as trauma, myocardial infarc- tion, stroke, pneumonia, anaphylaxis, and others come through the doors at all hours of the day and night. Some of these cases require emergencysubspecialty consultation, a service that is often difficult to provide in an ambulatory care setting. In addition, the emergency department has both an ethical and legal obligation to evaluate every patient who presents for care to determine whether he or she has a medical emergency, regardless of ability to pay for health care (Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act orEMTALA). One third of the nation's emergency departments are consid- ered high safety net sites. These institutions serve a disproportionately high number of Medicaid and uninsured patients, a dramatically differ-ent payer mix than that of the routine ambulatory care population. In the inpatient setting, patient encounters often occur after a prelimi- nary or definitive diagnosis has been made by another health care pro-vider, many times by the emergency physician. Across the country, emergency departments are responsible for approximately 55% of all hospital admissions (Owens et al., 2006). Physicians caring for inpatientsface legitimate challenges, some diagnostic, others therapeutic or social, such as short- or long-term placement issues. We all know that medical emergencies occur in the inpatient population; luckily they are not ascommon as in the emergency department. When they do occur, the health care team often has the benefit of prior rapport with the patient and family, along with some understanding of the patient's medical condi-tion before the event at hand. This is in stark contrast to unexpected emergencies that present to the emergency department requiring prompt resuscitation and stabilization without the benefit of an adequate histo-ry of present illness (HPI) or knowledge of the patient's medical history, prenatal care, medications, and the like. The emergency department also differs dramatically from both the inpa- tient and ambulatory care setting in a few other areas. First and fore-The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 15most, the emergency department never closes, and the volume of pa- tients cared for is not limited by the number of patient care spaces. Al-though it is foreseeable that patients with nonurgent complaints will need to wait until an appropriate patient care area is available before they will be evaluated, the sick or unexpected emergencies are at timescared for in less-than-optimal patient care areas, such as a hallway. In the emergency department, the spectrum of patients ranges from the young to the very old, representing disease states of the newborn to the variouscomplications seen in the elderly nursing home resident. The clinical scenarios encountered are also unique to this setting and can range from routine medical and surgical pathology to environmental emergencies,toxic exposures, substance abuse, trauma, psychiatric emergencies, and more. It is also necessary to realize that patient-specific goals are different in the emergency department from other health care settings. This can di- rectly translate into a better understanding of the specialty-specific ap- proach to a particular clinical scenario or chief complaint. Understandinghow emergency physicians approach particular clinical problems will al- low students to better place the educational and patient care objectives of their rotation in perspective. See the case study shown in this chapteran example. Focusing on the problem at hand is key to managing most cases in the emergency department. Whether we are talking about a complaint-directed H&PE, case presentation skills, or a case-specific differential di- agnosis, the art of focusing\u2014that is, being able to see the forest through the trees, identifying and relaying pertinent positive or negative case spe-cific information\u2014is crucial to understanding the role of the emergency physician and providing excellent patient care. Remember, the focus of the emergency department is different from other health care settings.Therefore, your approach to certain chief complaints or patient presen- tations may need to be modified to keep in line with providing optimal and efficient care in the emergency department. One final point that deserves mentioning is that the patient presenting to the emergency department must be considered at higher risk for po- Comparison of the Three Patient Care S ettings Emergency Department Inpatient require admission N/A 1% of patients require hospital admission Undifferentiated patients with complaint-based presentations Admitted patients have a preliminary diagnosis Routine medical and follow-up care account for a majority of patient visits No prior rapport with patient and family After initial evaluation, will develop rapport with patient and family Usually have established rapport with patient and family Most diagnostic studies ordered are urgent or emergent Diagnostic studies ordered can be nonurgent, urgent, or emergent Most diagnostic studies ordered are nonurgent Results of diagnostic studies available within minutes to hours Results of diagnostic studies available within hours to days Results of diagnostic studies available within days No scheduled visits; patients are evaluated in order of acuity Most admissions are unscheduled Sche duled visits on a first-come-first- served basis, occasional unscheduled visits 16 \u0083 Differences Between the Emergency Department, the Office, and the Inpatient Settingtential serious illness than a similar patient presenting to an office or other outpatient clinic setting. Many patients presenting to the emer-gency department have acute symptoms. These complaints may reflect more serious underlying pathology when compared with the patient who is willing or able to wait several days for an outpatient appointment. Inaddition, patients choosing to come to an emergency department for an evaluation rather than going to an outpatient office should alert the car- egiver that the patient may believe he or she is too sick to wait for ascheduled appointment; at times, they are right. Thus, patient care in the emergency department is quite different from other health care settings. It is important to be aware of these differencesso that, as a medical student, you understand that the clinical and bed- side skills needed to succeed in the emergency department are different from skills needed to succeed in other settings. Understanding and em-bracing these differences will allow for a more educational and enjoyable experience. Suggested Reading Cherry DK, Woodwell DA, Rechtsteiner EA.

Open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, the emergency department can serve as both the point of first contact and the bastion of last resort for an incredibly diverse group of patients with differing and unexpected medical needs. Unique among medical specialties, the mission and charge of the emergency physician is to carefor all patients regardless of financial resources, severity of illness, or even the nature of the complaint. Whereas other specialists focus on a partic- ular body system or category of illness, the emergency physician must beprepared to treat patients across the spectrum of disease and age. Each patient represents a mystery, an unknown quantity for the clinician. It is the unwavering fact that anyone can come through the doors at anytime, which presents us with one of our greatest clinical challenges: the undifferentiated patient. Approach to the Undifferentiated Patient When you first encounter a patient in the emergency department, you must make an instantaneous assessment of both the severity of the threatto the patient's life and limb and the need for immediate intervention. This determination is often made within a few moments of your patient encounter; that is, is the patient sick or not sick? Sometimes this decisionmay be easy, such as the patient with a gun shot wound to the chest or a patient presenting in severe respiratory distress. Many times, however, the distinction between \"sick and not sick\" may be much more subtle.Consider the following cases: an 80 year-old nursing home resident with a fever; a 40 year-old patient with a history of asthma presenting slightly diaphoretic, breathing 35 times per minute; a patient presenting postic-tal after a new onset seizure. All of these patients may be critically ill and require immediate intervention, and the skilled medical student, resi- dent, or attending must be able to recognize this. As a student, yourprimary role if you identify a \"sick or potentially sick\" patient is to im- mediately notify your supervising physician\u2014you will see this as a recur- ring theme. In a patient with abnormal vital signs who appears stable, itmay be appropriate to repeat the vital signs yourself and then notify your supervisor promptly if they remain abnormal. In determining the severity of a patient's illness and the need for imme- diate intervention, the emergency physician relies on a combination of clinical experience and instinct, integrating all of the available informa-Unique among medical specialties, the mission and charge of theemergency physician is to care forall patients regardless of financialresources, severity of illness, or eventhe nature of the complaint.

The classic example i s the pregnant young womanwho presents with abdomina l pain. On the top of your dif - ferential list should always b e ectopic pregnancy.18 \u0083 Undifferentiated and Differentiated Patientstion into his or her decisionmaking process. Findings that may indicate severe illness include abnormal vital signs and an alteration in mentalstatus (depressed level of consciousness or agitation). The astute clini- cian should recognize these findings as indicative of a potentially life- threatening condition and should act on them promptly. Perhaps themost important measure of the severity of patient illness is physician \"gestalt,\" that is, the gut instinct that something just is not right. This is one of the most important qualities a physician can develop. Once a critical illness is identified, the physician must be prepared to act. In many cases, this means forgoing the natural progression from obtaining a medical history to performing a physical examination toformulating an assessment, and implementing a management plan. These cases often require the clinician to immediately focus the H&PE and jump right to case-specific management. Although the specific inter-vention will vary for individual patients, some general treatment prin- ciples should be followed. At times, you may hear your supervisor refer to the \"emergency department safety net.\" This term refers to the initi-ation of cardiac monitoring, obtaining vascular access, and providing supplemental oxygen if needed. Assessing ABCDs of Resuscitation As specialists in resuscitation, an emergency physician's first priority is assessing the airway (A), breathing (B), and circulation (C), followed byan evaluation of neurologic disability. Ignoring deficiencies in one of these areas will inevitably lead to worsening of the patient's clinical con- dition. Indications for emergency airway management may include hy-poxia, hypercarbia, altered mental status, failure to tolerate oral secretions, and the anticipation of a worsening clinical condition. Remember, the ABCs are about much more than just intubation. In any ill patient, care-ful attention must be paid to oxygenation status, respiratory effort and pattern, and blood pressure and the presence of any neurologic deficit. In addition to evaluating disability, the \"D\" should always stand for mea-surement of serum glucose followed by administration of dextrose if a patient with an altered mental status is found to be hypoglycemic. Addressing Abnormal Vital Signs At the very least, if a patient has abnormal vital signs, vitals should be repeated and monitored closely. As a general rule, certain conditions (i.e.,hypotension, severe hypertension with target organ damage, hyperther- mia, hypothermia, bradycardia, tachycardia, tachypnea, and bradypnea) will require intervention and stabilizing measures initiated early in thecourse of their evaluation. These actions may include, but are not limit- ed to, cardioversion of unstable tachyarrhythmias, supplemental oxy- gen, passive or active rewarming, or administration of intravenous fluids. As a corollary, the effect of such interventions needs to be closely moni- tored. Remember, the underlying cause of all abnormal vital signs should be investigated. This axiom can not be overstated. Vital sign abnormali-ties are often the result, not necessarily the cause, of a systemic insult. The investigation into the etiology of the abnormal vital signs should be delayed until stabilizing measures are initiated. Treating Pain An absolute tenet of emergency medicine practice is to treat the patients'pain. Pain-related complaints are far and away the most common reason for patients presenting to the emergency department, with abdominal pain and chest pain being the two most frequent chief complaints. To-Findings of Potentially Serious Illness \u0084Heart rate > 120 or < 60 beats/minute \u0084Respiratory rate > 20 or < 10 breaths/minute \u0084Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg \u0084Temperature > 38 < 35\u00b0C \u0084Hypoxia \u0084Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemiaThe Emergency Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 19gether, these complaints represent more than 13 million emergency de- partment visits annually across the country (Nawar, 2007). Not only is itmorally imperative to provide analgesia, it is the right thing to do. Pro- viding pain relief with an appropriate dose of an analgesic should not interfere with physical examination findings of peritonitis or accuracy ofselected diagnostic imaging studies. Approaching the Stable Patient Once the clinician is assured that the patient is stable, he or she should use a focused, systematic approach to evaluation and management. Par- amount to this is obtaining an accurate history. It is important to allowthe patient to provide the history in his or her own words. The use of open-ended questions allows patients to describe their condition and presenting complaints as they experience them. Examples of appropriateopen-ended questions include the following: \"What brings you to the hospital today?\" or \"How can I help you today?\" Patients should be al- lowed sufficient time to describe their symptoms, while the clinician lis-tens carefully for clues to the underlying diagnosis. After the patient has been given time to explain his or her complaints, the caregiver should ask appropriate follow-up questions to fill in any gaps. Although thesequestions are often open ended as well, a more directed inquiry may be necessary. The clinician should seek information that can help clarify the patient's diagnosis or point toward an appropriate workup. Be a med-ical pessimist Never assume that a patient's complaint represents a be- nign issue until all high morbidity and mortality conditions have been considered and sufficiently excluded. Be a Medical Pessimist Don't make assumptions until you have ruled out all high morbidity andmortality conditions. The classic example is the pregnant young woman who presents with abdominal pain. On the top of your differential list should always be ectopic pregnancy. Approach each patient, regardless of complaint, with a broad differential diagnosis, with the most serious conditions at the top of your list, that is, the \"worst first\" mentality. For example, always assume that chest paincould be caused by one of many potential life-threatening processes (e.g., acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, pericarditis, pneumotho- rax, pneumonia, aortic dissection, or esophageal rupture). Less seriousdiagnoses can be considered once these processes have been eliminated. This, of course, does not mean that every patient with chest pain re- quires cardiac enzymes, a CT scan, an ECG, and the like, but it is prudentto consider all high-risk diagnoses in each patient rather than rejecting them outright because of the patient's age or an atypical presentation. By taking an accurate history and performing a focused physical examina-tion, many of these differentials can be effectively excluded without an extensive workup. The healthcare provider can use the initial H&PE to narrow the differential diagnosis, focusing in on likely causes to guidethe evaluation. Keeping an Open Mind It is important not to limit the differential diagnoses based solely on the patient's chief complaint and presenting symptoms. Although this in- formation is vital, limiting your differential diagnosis can be dangerous.Consider the elderly diabetic patient who presents with nausea and vom- iting. Focusing only on gastrointestinal causes may delay the diagnosis of other potentially serious conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis ormyocardial ischemia. It is imperative to listen to the patient, but it is justIn determining the severity of a patient's illness and the need forimmediate intervention, the emer-gency physician relies on a combi-nation of clinical experience andinstinct, integrating all of the avail-able information into his or herdecisionmaking process.20 \u0083 Undifferentiated and Differentiated Patientsas important at times to step back and think outside of the box. By keep- ing an open mind and not getting locked in, you will avoid the potentialpitfall of honing in on a particular diagnosis before all of the informa- tion is available, also known as \"premature closure.\" Just as it is danger- ous to assume a patient has a benign condition, it is equally wrong tojump to a diagnosis too quickly. Do not be afraid to change your diag- nostic considerations as additional information or test results become available. When test results, or responses to therapy, do not fit with thepresumed diagnosis, reevaluate the patient. Following the Best Path You can't always walk a straight line; sometimes patient care follows aroundabout path. When evaluating the undifferentiated patient, it is notalways possible to progress gradually from H&PE to diagnostics to treat- ment. Often it is necessary to perform two or more of these tasks simul- taneously. In the critically ill patient, the emergency physician will oftenbe deciding which diagnostic tests are needed while simultaneously con- versing with, examining, and treating the patient. In addition, the re- sponse to an intervention may help guide additional testing strategies. Apatient presenting with an exacerbation of asthma that improves with bronchodilator therapy might not require a chest radiograph or ABG, whereas a nonresponder might. Differentiated Patients Certain subsets of patients present a special challenge in the emergencydepartment and deserve brief mention. Although a detailed discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of this manual, be aware of the inher- ent complexity in caring for these patients. Some groups of differentiat-ed patients include the elderly, children, psychiatric patients, and the chronically ill. The differentiated patient can also present a diagnostic challenge for the emergency physician. An approach to these encoun-ters should be performed in a logical and systematic fashion to avoid the pitfalls of a delay or misdiagnosis. Elderly Patients Elderly patients can present some of the most difficult diagnostic chal- lenges for the emergency physician. This group is at high risk for a numberof reasons. Life-threatening cardiac, pulmonary, vascular, and neurologic conditions are far more common in this population, and the elderly are more likely than the general population to have significant underlyinghealth problems. Geriatric patients are often taking multiple medications, which may contribute to their presentation or may interact with prescribed therapies. They also have decreased physiologic reserves, which affects theirresponse to critical illness or injury. Prob lems with memor y in some pa- tients can also limit your ability to obtain a clear history, further compli- cating the clinical encounter. In addition, the presentation of certainmedical conditions (e.g., myocardial infarction) may be atypical, with vague, nonspecific symptoms actually being the harbinger of serious underlying illness. In the elderly, a bacterial infection is not always associated with afever or leukocytosis. This finding may inadvertently lessen the suspicion of an infectious etiology. Weakness and confusion are common present- ing complaints that can represent a whole spectrum of disease, includinginfectious, cardiac, endocrine, and neurologic conditions. Finally, when working with the elderly, end-of-life issues may need to addressed with both the patient and the family, which can be a daunting task.When working with the elderly, end- of-life issues may need to addressedwith both the patient and thefamily, which can be a dauntingtask.The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 21When evaluating a geriatric patient, it is prudent to be both vigilant and conservative at the same time. Consider a broad differential diagnosis,keeping in mind that typical diseases may present atypically. Use as many sources as possible to obtain a medical history, including family mem- bers, past medical records, the primary care physician, or nursing homerecords, when applicable. When the history or symptoms are vague, or the patient is unable to provide detailed information, clinicians should have a low threshold for obtaining diagnostic studies. The geriatric emer-gency department patient also presents a clinical challenge as this subset (65 years of age or older) of patients are sicker than the general popula- tion and represent the greatest percentage (41%) of hospital admissionsof all age groups (Nawar, 2007). Finally, if an elderly patient is going to be discharged, it is important to ensure that he or she will have adequate social support and access to follow-up medical care. Pediatric Patients As with the elderly, obtaining a history from a young child can be diffi-cult. In preverbal children, the information must be obtained entirely from the parents or other caretakers. Even with older children, anxiety and misunderstanding can prevent the emergency physician from get-ting an accurate history. Remember, infants are at risk for serious bacteri- al infection, although the introduction of haemophilus and pneumococcal vaccines has significantly decreased this threat. In addi-tion, be aware of the high prevalence of maltreatment and neglect in this population and consider abuse in all pediatric patient encounters. Whenever possible, children should be examined with their parents present to minimize anxiety, unless the health care provider suspects abuse. The exception is adolescents, who may feel more comfortable dis- cussing personal issues without their parents present. These encounters,however, should be chaperoned by an additional health care provider, preferably of the same gender as the patient. Emergency physicians need to remember that children are not just little adults. The spectrum of disease across the pediatric population is vastly different from that of the adult population. Seasonal variations of illness are more common, and clinical presentations of disease in infants andtoddlers may be different as compared to adolescents and adults. The healthcare provider should be familiar with the different size and type of equipment required for pediatric resuscitation and medication doses asthese also differ from adult patients. Patients With a History of Psychiatric Illness Patients with a history of psychiatric illness is another challenging sub- set of patients encountered in the emergency department. It is impor- tant to exclude organic pathology before attributing a patient'spresentation to a functional illness. Be a patient advocate, especially in these cases. In addition, many of these patients take medications that have a high likelihood of side effects and toxicity. Others are noncompli-ant, which can result in an exacerbation of their underlying mental health condition. Deciphering between functional and organic etiologies of patient presentations is challenging and not always straightforward. Patients With Chronic Health Conditions It is becoming more and more commonplace to encounter emergency department patients who have chronic health conditions such as ischemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, asthma,Emergency physicians need to remember that children are not justlittle adults.22 \u0083 Undifferentiated and Differentiated Patientschronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, and end stage renal disease. These patients suffer from the same maladies as the general pop-ulation but may at times be at higher risk for complications because of their chronic health condition or prescribed medical therapy. Approach even the stable appearing patient with a complex medical history with adegree of skepticism. When caring for a patient with a complex medical history, be careful not to glance over details that might prove to be important. Consider thefollowing: \u0084As in all cases, initiate stabilizing care immediately if necessary. \u0084In a stable patient, procede in a logical systematic fashion performinga focused yet thorough H&PE. \u0084Spend time reviewing the past medical or surgical history to betterfamiliarize yourself with the extent of the patients chronic health con-dition. \u0084Review pertinent medical records and contact the patient's primarycare physician when indicated. \u0084Consider whether the presenting complaint is related to or compli- cated by the underlying chronic health condition. \u0084If the patient is presenting with an exacerbation of a chronic illness (e.g., asthma, congestive heart failure), try to place the severity of the current presentation in context with prior exacerbations. \u0084Consider using risk reduction strategies such as medication reconcili- ation to prevent prescribing errors or adverse medication effects that can occur with patients on multiple medications.

In the majority of cases, a focused differential diagnosis and eventual dis- position can be derived from the initial H&PE. Although a single piece of historical information or finding on physical examination may not rule in or rule out a particular diagnosis, taken in aggregate, the H&PE is a power-ful diagnostic tool that drives further evaluation. The H&PE provides much of the information necessary to develop a patient-specific problem list, which allows you to formulate your differential diagnosis. Subsequently,as you master the art of focusing your H&PE, you will improve your diag- nostic skills and care for patients with increased comfort and efficiency. Each specialty has a slightly different approach to performing an H&PE. In the emergency department, our approach to the H&PE is partly time sensitive because of patient volume and acuity. In the emergency de- partment, the depth of the H&PE will be based on the patient's com-plaint, sometimes brief and focused, other times more comprehensive. Remember, the time required to perform a comprehensive H&PE for a new patient visit in an office practice is vastly different than the timenecessary to evaluate many patients that you will encounter in the emer- gency department. In emergency medicine, you must balance the time needed to perform a focused but inclusive H&PE with the time-sensitivenature of diagnosis, treatment, and disposition. A recommended rule of the thumb for students is to complete your initial evaluation within 10 to 15 minutes. However, regardless of the patient complaint, your evalu-ation should be thorough. The primary goal of the complaint-directed H&PE is to diagnose or ex- clude potentially life- or limb-threatening disease or injury. More simplystated, the goal is to determine who is \"sick\" and who is \"not sick,\" a familiar theme that you will hear more than once in this Primer . The other goal is to exclude any potential causes of serious morbidity and, ifpossible, to arrive at the correct diagnosis. The dynamic differential diag- nosis developed from your H&PE is what drives many of the case-specific questions that you will ask the patient during the encounter. The moreinformation you gather during the H&PE, the more your differential di- agnosis narrows and the more detailed and specific your evaluation be- comes. Although the H&PE are often performed simultaneously, in thissection we will discuss them separately.Early on, the emergency depart- ment safety net (cardiac monitor-ing, IV access, and supplementaloxygen) should be incorporatedinto the management of all poten-tially sick patients.24 \u0083 Performing a Complaint-Directed History and Physical ExaminationPrimary Survey For the majority of patients you will encounter, it will be obvious that their airway is unobstructed, that they are breathing without distress, and that there is no sign of systemic hypoperfusion. Howev-er, some of the patients that you encounter may have acute life- or limb-threatening presentations that cannot afford even the minimal 10 to 15 minutes required for a focused H&PE. In these cases (e.g.,trauma, hypotension, shortness of breath, chest pain, altered mental status), your approach to the H&PE will deviate from the traditional approach of interviewing the patient followed by a systematic butfocused physical examination. When a patient presents with a serious health condition, the initial goal of the primary survey is to identify any immediate life-threatening con-dition and intervene as warranted. This is accomplished by approaching the patient in a systematic fashion. A classic example of this strategy is taught in the advanced trauma life support course. When evaluating avictim of trauma (or a seriously ill medical patient), focus first on evalu- ating airway patency and assessing for signs of airway obstruction. The next step is to evaluate the patient to ensure adequate oxygenation andventilation. This may require exposure of the neck and inspec- tion, palpation, auscultation of the chest; pulse oximetry; and perhaps even obtaining an ABG in selected cases. See the case study shown onthis page for an example. As a medical student, it is always important to realize that you will be working under the guidance of a senior emergency medicine residentor an attending physician. If at any time you encounter a critically ill patient, you should immediately notify your supervisor\u2014another re- curring theme. Remember, in the emergency department, the variedpathology and high acuity often causes the health care provider to de- viate from the standard approach of obtaining a medical history fol- lowed by a physical examination. Early on, the emergency departmentsafety net (cardiac monitoring, IV access, and supplemental oxygen) should be incorporated into the management of all potentially sick patients. The Medical History The depth and detail of your medical interview will vary depending onthe patient's chief complaint. Some patients will present to the emergen- cy department with a very straightforward complaint or injury: sore throat, twisted ankle, cutaneous abscess, laceration, and the like. Other com- Case Study Consider a patient who presents after penetrating trauma to the right anterior chest. An emergency physician would identify that the patient has a patent airway, that he can phonate normally, but that heappears to be in significant respiratory distress. On further evaluation after full exposure, a 1-cm stabwound to the right anterior chest wall, fourth intercostal space, midclavicular line is noted. On palpationof the right chest, subcutaneous air is discovered, and, on auscultation, breath sounds are diminished.His blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg; his skin is cool and clammy. Rapidly putting the case together, thepatient has subcutaneous air, decreased breath sounds on the side of the injury, and hypotension.Because a rapid primary survey was performed in a systematic fashion, a life-threatening condition(suspected tension pneumothorax) was immediately identified. Emergently, this patient would undergoneedle decompression of the pneumothorax followed by the placement of a chest tube.Think of the medical history as a conversation with a purpose. Itstarts by identifying the chief com-plaint; that is, why did the patientcome to the hospital?The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 25plaints such as weakness, dizziness, or abdominal pain in the elderly will require a much more extensive medical interview. Because of the com-plaint-oriented nature of our patient presentations, it is important for you to learn how and when to focus your medical interviewing skills. Remember, a focused history does not mean cursory. Think of the medical history as a conversation with a purpose. It starts by identifying the chief complaint; that is, why did the patient come to the hospital? For most ambulatory emergency department patient en-counters, this information can often be obtained from the nursing triage form. In the emergency department, a triage nurse interviews ambulato- ry patients before they see a physician. The purpose of this brief, limitedevaluation is to determine the order in which patients need to be evalu- ated. The triage form will provide you with some basic information, but it should not be a substitute for obtaining or verifying information di-rectly from the patient. Information commonly documented on a nurs- ing triage form includes the patient's chief complaint, past medical history, medications, allergies, and vital signs. When interviewing a patient, asimple opening statement can often provide you with a wealth of infor- mation. For example; \"Hello Mr. Smith, I am student doctor________. How can I help you today?\" or \"What seems to be wrong today?\" Open-ended questions will allow the patient to respond in his or her own words. It is important not to interrupt patients when they are responding to your opening statement. Demonstrating exemplary listening skills willhelp you develop rapport with your patient. The upfront information that you obtain from the patient will serve to direct you as you investi- gate the HPI. For many chief complaints, certain basic information should be ob- tained: the onset of the problem, the location of the complaint, the duration of the problem, and the quality of the pain. At times it may benecessary to supplement this question with specific modifiers (e.g., sharp, dull, pressure). Other key features that may be necessary to obtain include the pres- ence of aggravating or alleviating factors, response to prior therapy or treatment, associated symptoms, and risk factors for certain medical conditions such as coronary artery disease or venous thromboembo-lism. A mnemonic to remember when trying to obtain cardinal charac- teristics of a patient's chief complaint is \"OPQRST\" (onset, provocative/ palliative, quality, region, radiation, severity, timing, temporal relation-ships, and therapeutics). Obtaining an accurate history is the first of many crucial steps that will allow you to offer the best care to your patients. Remember, many times, a preliminary diagnosis will be madeon the basis of the history alone. This will depend of course on your ability to elicit, synthesize, and interpret the relevant information. Other important aspects of the medical history are a complaint-directed review of systems (ROS); past medical, surgical, and obstetrical history; social and family history; medications; and allergies. Early on, some med- ical students have difficulty focusing their ROS questioning. At the bed-side, it is common to intertwine questions that pertain to both the HPI and the ROS. However, it is usually not necessary to perform a compre- hensive ROS evaluation on patients in the emergency department. Onerecommended approach that can be used after completion of your fo- cused H&PE is to ask the patient if there is anything else that they would like to talk about that was not already covered. For most patients, a thor-ough evaluation can be obtained by focusing on the presenting prob- lem. However, never ignore a pertinent finding that is discovered even incidentally when interviewing or examining a patient.Basic Information to Gather \u0084Onset: Identify when the problem started, the sur - rounding circumstances, and the severity of the complain t when it began. \u0084Location: If it is a painful com - plaint such as chest pain o r abdominal pain, ask the pa - tient to point where it hurt s and elicit whether the pain has moved to a different lo - cation since it started. \u0084Duration: Determine how long the patient has been hav - ing the complaint and whether it has been constan t or intermittent. If the com - plaint is intermittent, it maybe of importance to establish how long each episode lasts . \u0084Quality: How does the patien t describe his or her complain t or pain?26 \u0083 Performing a Complaint-Directed History and Physical ExaminationIn certain clinical scenarios, it will be beneficial to obtain additional his- tory (if possible) from witnesses, family, or prehospital personnel. Forexample, when evaluating a 45-year-old male restrained driver involved in a motor vehicle accident, fire department personnel can provide valu- able information. Was the patient trapped in the car? Was the wind-shield cracked or the steering wheel deformed? Was there intrusion of the driver's side door into the vehicle? What was the condition of the patient at the scene? Was the patient able to self-extricate? In the emergency department, a number of patient-related barriers can affect your ability to obtain an accurate or thorough history. These in- clude encounters with young children, the actively psychotic, the debil-itated or demented, patients presenting with an altered mental status, and patients with limited English proficiency. Remember that as a result of federal mandates, a hospital must offer and provide language assis-tance services to patients with limited English proficiency, including bi- lingual staff or interpreter services, at no cost to the patient, in a timely manner during all hours of operation. In general, to limit miscommuni-cation or bias, family and friends should not be used to provide interpre- tation services, except at the request of the patient. Keep in mind that when describing their presenting complaint, some patients will use certain terms that have a different meaning to them than to you. This may be encountered in the patient who complains of a migraine headache. Many patients presenting with the complaint of aheadache have not had a formal evaluation but will use the term mi- graine headache. This is likely because of the common misuse of the term migraine by the lay public. Another example is the use of the term dizziness. This commonly used descriptive, when looked at more closely, may reflect any of the following meanings: lightheadedness, unsteadi- ness, or vertigo. Other patients may have cultural differences or languagedifficulties that can affect their ability to describe certain complaints or conditions. Remember, when patients describe their symptoms, they may use different language than you would use to describe the same symp-toms. This can make it more difficult to determine what is wrong with the patient and may lead to frustration. If you are having difficulty un- derstanding a patient describing his or her symptom complex, try tohave him or her explain it in different terms or repeat it back to ensure that you both understand each other. Many times, it can be helpful to summarize and clarify the history with the patient. Please keep in mindthe cultural differences that you may encounter in the emergency de- partment and be sensitive to these issues if they arise. Physical Examination The physical examination usually starts with an appreciation of the gener- al appearance of the patient, followed by an immediate review of the vitalsigns (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature). With the advent of noninvasive bedside testing, many physicians consider pulse oximetry testing the fifth vital sign. Beware of the statements \"vital signsare stable\" or \"vital signs are within normal limits.\" Remember, the nor- mal range of vital signs varies with the age of the patient. It is much more important to appreciate the vital signs in context to the presenting com-plaint and bedside examination. A patient with a history of poorly con- trolled hypertension with a blood pressure of 102/58 mm Hg technically has a normal pressure; however, in this case, the patient is relatively hy-potensive. In some cases, baseline vital signs obtained from old medical records may be of assistance. Often, vital sign trends are much more im- portant than isolated readings. Also, keep in mind that elevated bloodpressure measurements are as common in the emergency department pop-An appreciation of the general appearance of the patient is crucial.Simply stated, how does the patientlook when you walk into the room?The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 27ulation as they are in the general population. Many of these patients do not require acute intervention to lower their blood pressure. An appreciation of the general appearance of the patient is crucial. Sim- ply stated, how does the patient look when you walk into the room? The concept of \"sick or not sick\" can often be made at the bedsideduring the first 5 to 10 seconds of the encounter. The more patients you encounter, the better you will become at making this determina- tion. Up to this point, the assessment of the vital signs and an appreci-ation of the general evaluation should have taken just a minute or two. A seasoned clinician will determine whether to continue with a sys- tematic evaluation or to deviate from this traditional approach andperform a focused physical examination and initiate diagnostic or ther- apeutic measures as warranted. Remember, the template for performing a comprehensive head to toe physical examination has its place; however, in many circumstances, a patient presenting to the emergency department does not require a com- prehensive examination. In the stable patient presenting with a minoror nonurgent complaint, your physical examination can proceed in a systematic, yet focused, fashion. The exam should follow the typical or- der of inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation, if applicable.An adequate knowledge of surface and bony anatomy will be helpful, especially in patients presenting with musculoskeletal complaints. In some patients with nonspecific complaints or when you need to perform amore comprehensive evaluation, think of the physical examination as a screening tool. If pertinent or positive findings are detected, a more de- tailed and focused exam can then be performed supplanted by addition-al bedside or other diagnostic tests. In certain clinical scenarios such as abdominal pain, shortness of breath, or altered mental status, avoid the pitfall of relying solely on your initialexamination. Presentations such as these require serial examinations to ensure a response to therapy or to identify a change in condition during the time the patient is being observed. A change in condition for betteror worse may affect your ultimate disposition of the patient. Another pitfall to avoid when performing your physical examination is inade- quate exposure of the affected area. At times because of emergency de-partment overcrowding, a patient may be in a treatment area that is not conducive to a proper examination An example may be the patient with right lower quadrant abdominal pain who is in a hallway bed. If warrant-ed, move the patient to a separate examination area to perform a proper evaluation. Despite the importance and utility of the H&PE, it is also useful to ac- knowledge its limitations. It is uncommon that a single historical feature or physical examination finding will reveal the diagnosis in many pa- tients. This is especially important to remember in catastrophic diseases,which may not present classically. For example, the lack of vaginal bleed- ing does not rule out an ectopic pregnancy. That being said, medical interviewing and physical examination skills are crucial to providingexcellent patient care. The constellation of signs, symptoms, and exam- ination findings will help direct your diagnostic workup. Suggested Reading Bickley LS, Szilagyi PG.

A large part of the emergency physician's job is gathering information from a wide vari- ety of sources to construct an accurate picture of the patient's clinical condition. A detailed history is often the key to diagnosis. However, obtaining an adequate history in the emergency department can be challenging. Re- member, at times medical information will have to be obtained frommultiple sources. Keeping this in mind, you should always try to gather as much medical information as possible directly from the patient. We are well aware that it can be difficult to elicit a clear and concise history of present illness from some patients. This can be related to an underlying or acute medical condition, a language barrier, or the pa- tient's level of formal education. However, it is important to resist thetemptation to limit your data gathering because of an inability to obtain detailed information from your patient. Spending additional time with the patient to clarify certain details or to use other resources can be in-valuable. Remember, think creatively and do not get frustrated. The case study presented here gives an example of when \"thinking outside the box\" can help you get potentially life-saving medical information thatmay have otherwise been difficult or impossible to obtain. The box on the next page contains a checklist of suggestions to consider when you are having difficulty getting a clear and concise medical histo-ry. Even when the patient is capable of providing a detailed and accurate history, it may be of help to verify certain aspects of the history with Case Study\u2014Thinking Creatively A patient presents to the hospital with abdominal pain and vomiting for 3 days. He has a complicated medical history, including diabetes, hypertension, thyroid disease, and congestive heart failure. He doe s not recall the names of most of his medications and has never received medical care at your facility . Although this patient can not recall the names of his medications, he likely knows the name and locationof the pharmacy where he gets his prescriptions filled. Thinking out of the box, calling the pharmacy, andspeaking with a pharmacist may provide valuable medical information that otherwise would have beendifficult to obtain.A detailed history is often the key to diagnosis.30 \u0083 Data-Gathering Skillsfriends or family to make sure no key detail goes unaddressed. To ensure patient confidentiality, it is important that you get the patient's permis- sion before discussing any aspect of his or her medical history with friendsor family. Other commonly used alternative sources of historical infor- mation include the following: \u0084Nurses: Always read the triage nurse's notes, and do not forget to look at the nursing record. You can also ask nurses for their initial impres- sion. Nurses can tell you whether the patient was accompanied by family or friends who may be in the waiting room. \u0084Emergency medical service (EMS) personnel: It is always a good idea to talk with the EMS personnel. They can often provide key de- tails about the condition of the patient at the scene or treatment ren- dered by bystanders or other first responders. In addition, they may provide important details about social conditions that are valuablewhen attempting to make disposition decisions. \u0084Old medical records: Obtaining the old medical records for a patient can provide valuable information about the patient's medical condi-tion, especially if a patient is unable to provide a concise history. Medi- cal records may confirm what a patient has already told you, add de- tails that the patient does not recall, or clarify the results of previousdiagnostic procedures. Sometimes the history is just not available. The nature of emergency medicine is that we must develop management plans and intervene based,at times, on little or no information. Either we are unable to obtain a good history and will have to base our plan on other available informa- tion, physical exam, and diagnostic tests or the patient is in extremis andthe time-sensitive nature of the presentation precludes the physician from obtaining a detailed history (e.g., gunshot wound to the chest). Remem- ber, the goal of data gathering in the emergency department is to obtainthe necessary information required to provide high-quality patient care. At times limited information can suffice, and other times more detailed information is needed to provide high-quality care.Suggestions for Taking a Clear and Concise Medical History \u0084Slow down and focus on one question at a time. \u0084Try not to interrupt patients while they are responding. \u0084Start your patient interview with open-ended questions. Use follow-up closed-ended questions fo r clarification. \u0084Use simple language; avoid the use of medical jargon. \u0084If the patient has a difficult time focusing, redirect with clarifying questions. \u0084If a language barrier is present, obtain a professional interpreter. Avoid using family or friends fo r translation, if at all possible. \u0084If you are getting frustrated, take a brief break. Get enough information to start the evaluation and return a short time later to refine the history.CHAPTER 9 Developing a Case- Specific DifferentialDiagnosis By this time in your medical school training, you should be fa miliar with the traditional concept of a differential diagnosis in which a list of possible diagnoses is generated and ruled in or out until a final diagnosis is identified. Like other fields of medi- cine, developing a differential diagnosis list is essential to the care of emergency patients, but the process of developing a differential di-agnosis in emergency medicine is distinctive. In the traditional model, the patient's signs and symptoms are catego- rized into a problem list (e.g., headache, chest pain, back pain). The dif-ferential diagnosis is generated from the patients' problem list. In emergency medicine, we not only focus on the likely diagnosis but must also think about the potentially life-threatening diagnoses or other prob-lems that could endanger the patient if delayed or missed. We may actu- ally never make the final diagnosis, but we can at least exclude life-threatening conditions. Medical Decisionmaking Several cognitive strategies are used in the medical decisionmaking pro-cess. These strategies include hypotheticodeductive, algorithmic, pattern recognition, rule-out-worst-case scenario, exhaustive, and event driven strategies. Each of these strategies has advantages and disadvantages. Toavoid error, it is helpful for clinicians to understand which strategies they are using and what the limitations are of the particular strategy. Hypotheticodeductive Decisionmaking Hypotheticodeductive is the most common decisionmaking strategy. A preliminary diagnosis is made on the basis of a series of inferences. Thisstrategy is most like the old fashioned detective who gathers clues about a particular suspect. The working diagnosis is tested and refined as new data are discovered. It is important for this hypothesis to be tested andIn emergency medicine, we not only focus on the likely diagnosis butmust also think about the poten-tially life-threatening diagnoses orother problems that could endan-ger the patient if delayed or missed. Case Study A 45-year-old man presents in the winter months with a complaint of headache and nausea. Hi s complaints started yesterday, and appear worse in the morning and improve throughout the day. A s a medical detective, if you do not consider carbon monoxide toxicity and attribute his complaints toa nonspecific illness, you will miss a critical diagnosis.32 \u0083 Developing a Case-Specific Differential DiagnosisA good clinician needs to be mindful of the concept of premature closure. Case Study Consider a 71-year-old male who presents to the emergency department with a traumatic right flan k pain. The most important condition to consider in this presentation is an abdominal aortic aneurysm . Although the patient may be much more likely to have a kidney stone, failure to consider abdomina l aortic aneurysm in your differential could have potentially catastrophic consequences if missed.verified. Failure to change course as contradictory information is gath- ered can lead to misdiagnosis because of premature closure. An advan-tage of the hypotheticodeductive method is that it is flexible. Algorithmic Decisionmaking In the algorithmic method, a series of steps is followed to simplify the decisionmaking process. An example could be chest pain pathways or pulmonary embolism diagnostic algorithms. This type of model is easyto teach and can improve the care for certain patients; however, algo- rithms are often too inflexible to cover all situations. The one-size-fits-all approach to patients can lead to problems if a patient presentation doesnot fit the algorithm. Pattern Recognition In pattern recognition, a series of signs and symptoms are clumped togeth- er into a known grouping. Pattern recognition is often used by seasoned clinicians with extensive clinical experience. Pattern recognition is subjectto premature closure and anchoring bias, in which physicians continue to stick with the original diagnosis despite conflicting data. Anchoring bias refers to the tendency to rely too heavily or to \"anchor\" on one piece ofinformation during the decisonmaking process. Failure to incorporate new data is known as confirmation bias. Confirmation bias can be compared to closed-mindedness. This pattern of decisionmaking refers to the tendencyto add weight or value to facts that confirm or support one's beliefs, while ignoring or undervaluing the relevance of contradictory information. Rule-Out-Worst-Case Scenario The rule-out-worst-case-scenario method is designed to eliminate the life- threatening diagnosis for a given clinical presentation rather than to fo- cus on the likely diagnosis. This style may, at times, lead to extensive workups and excessive use of resources. Less-experienced clinicians of-ten use this method because it is least likely to lead to catastrophic re- sults. However, the diagnosis of less common and noncritical diseases will often be delayed or missed completely when using the rule-out-worst-case-scenario method. Exhaustive Decisionmaking In the exhaustive method, all the possible data are gathered in an indis- criminate pattern and then sorted through. This method also can lead to excessive workups and is very time-consuming\u2014the typical \"shot gunapproach.\" Event-Driven event-driven decisionmaking, clinicians respond to the clinical sce-nario and treat the symptoms with limited thought as to the underlyingcause. An intervention is made, and the situation is reassessed. The clini- cian may at times back into the diagnosis on the basis of response to therapy. This strategy is often used for a critically ill patient such as oneThe Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 33in acute respiratory failure. The event-driven strategy is often combined with the rule-out-worst-case-scenario method. The event-driven methodis particularly well suited to the emergency department environment; however, it tends to be reactive rather than proactive. Putting Decisionmaking to Work Ruling out potential life-threatening presentations is a high priority in emergency medicine. Eliminating life-threatening conditions from thedifferential is more important than making the correct diagnosis of a benign condition, see the accompanying case. The important point is that if a particular illness, condition, or injury is not considered, sooneror later it may be missed. A good clinician needs to be mindful of the concept of premature clo- sure. This occurs when an incorrect diagnosis is made at an early stage ofthe patient encounter. In these cases, the differential diagnosis is too narrow, and the healthcare provider fails to consider other possibilities that could account for the patient's presenting complaint. As a result, anincorrect diagnosis is pursued, and the true underlying condition may be missed. Keep an open mind and a broad differential. As new informa- tion is acquired, or if the patient's condition changes, the differentialshould be reassessed and adjusted. If the new data do not support the leading diagnosis, other conditions need to be considered. Premature closure and failure to continually reassess the differential diagnosis canlead to catastrophic results. When creating a differential diagnosis, it is extremely important to create a list that includes all of the likely diagnoses as well as all of the potentiallylife-threatening conditions, even if they are uncommon or less likely. There is an old saying that \"you cannot make a diagnosis that you do not think about.\" Taken one step further, if you do not think of a particular diagno-sis, you will miss it. The case studies in this chapter describe such examples. So how do you begin to build a differential diagnosis? As a junior learner with limited clinical experience, a good differential is more often drawnfrom your fund of medical knowledge and less from your clinical experi- ence. For this reason, because emergency medicine is in many ways a com- plaint-driven specialty, it is helpful to review both common and potentiallyserious causes of routinely encountered chief complaints. Starting your rotation with a solid fund of medical knowledge will allow you to develop more in-depth differentials from day one. In the end, developing a differential diagnosis in emergency medicine is an active process incorporating a variety of decisionmaking skills. Data gathering, hypothesis testing, and treatment often occur simultaneous-ly. Clinicians need to be particularly careful to avoid premature closure on cases to avoid error. The true art of developing and working through your differential diagnosis is often made by the balance of ruling out thelife-threatening conditions and correctly diagnosing the likely conditions. Remember that not every diagnosis will be made in the emergency de- partment. The importance of developing a case-specific differential is thatyour assessment of the case will have a profound impact on your diag- nostic testing and management.

These advances have resulted in improved quality of life for the US public, as well as more timely diagnosis of many medical conditions. The healthcare provided in the emergency department has benefited greatly from advances in diagnostic testing. Just 25 years ago it was difficult to obtain more than basic labs and plain radiographs forpatients cared for in the emergency department. Today, because of advances in technology and the greater availability of diagnostic tests, definitive care can be initiated much earlier in the course of a patient'spresentation. The emergency department in some ways can be viewed as a diagnostic testing center in which a physician can coordinate a patient's care andthe results of most diagnostic tests are known within a few hours. The importance of diagnostic imaging to the efficient practice of emergency medicine cannot be overstated. In most centers, advanced diagnosticimaging, ultrasounds, CT scans, and even MRI studies can be obtained quickly and have a pronounced effect on patient care by providing a prompt definitive diagnosis for conditions such as intracranial hemor-rhage, pulmonary embolus, aortic aneurysm or dissection, and more. However, with the ease in obtaining these studies comes a price. Accord- ing to the American College of Radiology, diagnostic imaging is the fast-est growing medical expenditure in the United States, with an annual growth rate of 9% (Bettmann and Weinreb, 2007). This is three times that of general medical expenditures. In emergency departments acrossthe country from 1995 to 2004, the number of MRI and CT scans per- formed nearly quadrupled, and the number of ultrasounds more than doubled ( JAMA , 2006). Remember that the ease of obtaining certain di- agnostic tests, including advanced imaging studies, should not preclude or serve as a surrogate for performing a thorough H&PE. Before ordering a diagnostic test, ask yourself a few questions: \"What am I going to do with the test results?\" \"How is this test going to help me confirm or exclude the diagnosis?\" \"How will the test result affect my diagnostic strategy, management, or final disposition?\" These sim-ple yet important questions can help guide the proper use of a number of diagnostic tests ranging from relatively inexpensive blood tests to very expensive diagnostic imaging studies. Diagnostic tests should pri-marily be ordered to rule in or rule out a particular condition based on the differential diagnosis generated from the patient's H&PE. However,The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 35diagnostic tests are often ordered for a variety of reasons, including clinical suspicion of disease, dogma, perceived standard of care, a con-sultant's or primary care physician's request, a patient's request, and risk management concerns. Remember, in the real world there are times when you may need to order a diagnostic test that is not necessarilyevidence based. Sometimes, what we do is based on pattern recogni- tion and anecdotal experience. Experience may be the only pseudo- science behind the diagnostic workup of certain patients. As mentionedpreviously, a consultant physician may influence the diagnostic tests that are ordered for a particular patient. An example may be the patient presenting with abdominal pain. Your consultant may request that youorder a complete blood cell count and an obstruction series. If you have a high clinical suspicion for acute appendicitis, it should not be less- ened by a normal white cell blood count or a nondiagnostic obstruc- tion series. Consultant interactions may also serve as an opportunity to educate your colleagues when differences of opinion are raised as to the utility of a particular diagnostic test. The medical literature has reported validated approaches for diagnostic testing of certain conditions. Clinical decision rules, such as the Ottawa ankle and foot rules, the Nexus criteria the Canadian cervical spine rules,and others can be implemented to assist with the proper use of diagnos- tic tests (Steill et al., 1992, 1993, 2000; Hoffman, 2000). However, it must be remembered that the practice of medicine is an art as well as a science.With this in mind, there will be times when a particular diagnostic test is not indicated. To ensure that your patient expectations are being ad- dressed, communicate your thought process with your patient as to whyyou do not feel that a particular test is indicated. As a student or physi- cian, use this opportunity to educate your patients. Remember, the value of communication with patients cannot be overemphasized. Statistical Considerations Related to Diagnostic Testing Sensitivity and Specificity As much as we would like otherwise, many diagnostic tests are not abso- lute, and interpretation of the results may not be as simple as yes or no or black or white. A number of the tests have a range of probability forthe correct answer. Many tests have the possibility of giving us a true- positive (TP), false-positive (FP), true-negative (TN), or false-negative (FN) result. Therefore, it is important to understand the statistical concepts ofsensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity refers to the likelihood of a test being positive or abnormal in the presence of disease. Mathematically, sensitivity is expressed as follows: sensitivity = TP/(TP + FN) The higher the sensitivity of a test is, the lower the number of false neg- atives will be. A test with a high sensitivity also means that a negative result has a high probability of truly being negative because of the low number of false negatives. Highly sensitive tests are able to reasonablyrule out disease. A test that has poor sensitivity has a high likelihood of false-negative results. Specificity refers to the likelihood of the test being negative or normal in the absence of disease. It is represented mathematically as follows: specificity = TN/(TN + FP) A test that has high specificity means that it has a low rate of reporting false positives. A test that has poor specificity has a high likelihood of false-positive results.Before ordering a diagnosti c test, ask yourself a few ques - tions: \u0084What am I going to do with the test results? \u0084How is this test going to help me confirm or exclud e the diagnosis? \u0084 How will the test result af - fect my diagnostic strategy , management, or final dis - position?36 \u0083 Diagnostic Testing in the Emergency DepartmentThe sensitivity and specificity of a test is not affected by the prevalence (the proportion of diseased patients in the population). However, the predictive value of a test is affected by the prevalence of disease in thepopulation. Positive predictive value (PPV) refers to the likelihood of the patient truly having the disease when the test is positive or abnormal. PPV is represented mathematically as follows: PPV = TP/(TP + FP) Negative predictive value (NPV) refers to the likelihood that the patient does not have the disease when the test is negative or normal. NPV isrepresented as follows: TN/(TN + FN) Predictive values are highly affected by prevalence of disease in a given population. The lower the prevalence of a disease is, the higher the risk of a false-positive result will be and the lower the positive predictive val- ue will be for a particular test. Probability Another important point to consider is the diagnostic testing theory ofpretest and posttest probability. Probability relates to the concern that you have regarding a particular patient's having an illness or condition and how that concern may or may not be affected by the diagnostic testresults. An example of using pretest-posttest probability in the evalua- tion of chest pain is given in the box on this page. When assessing prob- ability, emergency physicians take into account trends and risk factors. Aseries of articles published in the Journal of the American Medical Associa- tion titled \"The Rational Clinical Exam\" reviews the current literature regarding a number of clinical conditions and provides evidence-basedrecommendations as to the usefulness of certain diagnostic tests in rul- ing in or ruling out a particular condition ( JAMA , 2008). Ultrasound Testing by Emergency Physicians In the past decade, the use of bedside ultrasound by emergency medicine residents and faculty in academic medical centers has become common-place. The application of this technology is also becoming more avail- Case Study\u2014Examining Probability For example, your patient is a 24-year-old, previously healthy, athletic male who presents with sharp fleeting chest pain lasting 5 minutes without shortness of breath while jogging earlier today. In the emergenc y department, he is without complaints. His ECG shows sinus rhythm with T-wave inversions V1-V3. Anothe r patient is a 63-year-old man. He smokes cigarettes and has a history of poorly controlled hypertension . Earlier today, he experienced 20 minutes of left-sided chest pain with exertion, radiating to his left shoulder , associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. His ECG shows normal sinus rhythm and is unchangedfrom an earlier ECG. The first patient has a relatively low pretest probability for cardiac chest pain. His ECGis not normal, but in a healthy young man, the T-wave inversions are nonspecific at best. These finding s have been commonly noted to be a normal variant in young healthy adults. The posttest probability (afte r the ECG was performed) that the 24-year-old patient has cardiac chest pain is still very low and is essentiall y unchanged by his abnormal ECG. However, the case of the 63-year-old patient with chest pain is ver y different. The pretest probability that he is having cardiac chest pain is relatively high. He has multiple ris k factors for coronary artery disease, and his history is suggestive of cardiac chest pain. Although his ECG i s normal, his posttest probability of having cardiac chest pain is no less concerning.The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 37able to community emergency physicians as well. The use of ultrasound as a diagnostic modality has been incorporated into the 2007 Model of the Clinical Practice of emergency medicine, a comprehensive document representing the essential information and skills necessary for the clini-cal practice of emergency medicine by board certified emergency physi- cians. The incorporation of bedside ultrasound by trained emergency physicians has been shown to improve patient outcomes and qualityand efficiency of patient care provided in the emergency department. The need to improve patient care has been the single most important driving factor responsible for the migration of this diagnostic imagingmodality out of the walls of the department of radiology. Clinical deci- sions regarding specialty consultation, operative management, and dis- position can now at times be made in minutes as opposed to hours. Theuse of ultrasound by emergency physicians does not in any way supplant the need for adequate follow up diagnostic imaging or confirmatory stud- ies in selected patients. The role or focus of emergency medicine bedsideultrasound (EMBU) is set forth to answer a few simple straightforward questions. EMBU is often used in selected clinical presentations to con- firm or exclude conditions such as hemoperitoneum, pericardial effu-sion, abdominal aortic aneurysm, cholelithiasis, and intrauterine gestation. Conclusion Diagnostics, including point of care testing in the emergency depart- ment, continues to evolve. As our technology continues to advance, wewill undoubtedly have greater access to the results of a multitude of diag- nostic studies in a timely fashion. We must still continue to strive to practice medicine in a cost-effective manner that benefits our patientsand does not overburden them and the health care system with unnec- essary, and at times overused, testing.

This document was generated by a taskforce charged with revising the core con- tent of emergency medicine and includes an extensive list of conditions seen andtreated in the emergency department, subdivided into one of three acuity levels.CHAPTER 11 Developing Your Plan of Action While focusing on your \"plan of action\" (diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic intervention), it is necessary to realize that in many emergency department patient encounters, care is pro- vided in a roundabout fashion. Because of the urgency of patient presen- tations, we do not always have the luxury of providing care in a structured manner the same way as in a low-acuity outpatient setting. Almost everyshift, we evaluate patients with head trauma, acute respiratory distress, altered mental status, and many other complaints that require the care provider to make certain critical decisions early on in the evaluation,many times before a comprehensive H&PE is completed. The evaluation of a \"sick or potentially sick\" patient cannot be performed in series; care must be provided in a parallel fashion. At times, the ordering of selectdiagnostic studies or the need to initiate therapeutics is evident immedi- ately. The overall plan, including the speed and order of implementa- tion, will be dictated by your concern for the patient's well-being. Thecase study on the next page provides an example of providing parallel care in an emergency department setting. Some patients that you encounter will be straightforward and nonurgent in nature. For these patients, you have the luxury of time. A focused H&PE can be performed. A problem list and differential diagnosis can be developed. A few minutes can be spent reviewing the medical literatureabout a certain aspect of the patient's presentation. However, decisions need to be made, some after careful consideration and reflection, others immediately. For each patient you encounter you need to ask yourself,\"What needs to be done for this patient?\" and \"What needs to be done now?\" Every patient is different. Some cases are not urgent, allowing decisions to be made in a sequence that permits observation or the re-sponse to therapy to guide further care. Other cases are urgent or emer- gent and require immediate action. Knowing if a patient is \"sick or potentially sick\" can many times be de- termined from the doorway, but sometimes it is not immediately clear. Certain findings, however, should be alarming: confusion; diaphoresis; cool, clammy skin; abnormal vital signs; and sudden severe pain are justa few clues that your patient may be sick. If the patient appears sick or if you believe there is a possibility that they have a serious underlying con- dition (e.g., cardiac chest pain, shortness of breath, a cold extremity, fo-cal weakness, sudden onset of severe abdomen or back pain), immediately curtail your evaluation and find your supervisor.If the patient appears sick or if you believe there is a possibility thatthey have a serious underlying con-dition (e.g., cardiac chest pain,shortness of breath, a cold extrem-ity, focal weakness, sudden onsetof severe abdomen or back pain),immediately curtail your evaluationand find your supervisor.40 \u0083 Developing Your Plan of ActionUnderstanding the Meaning of Vital Signs Make sure all vital signs have been taken, and repeat them yourself if needed. Abnormal vital signs may be one of the first red flags encoun- tered when evaluating a patient. However, do not forget that the pa-tients with \"normal\" vital signs may still harbor a serious underlying condition. Vital signs vary with age and have to be viewed in context with the clinical presentation. Although isolated vital sign measurementscan be significant, a persistent trend can be much more revealing as to the seriousness of the underlying condition or response to therapy. Vital sign abnormalities in general occur as a response to a variety of systemicinsults. Aside from cardiac rhythm disturbances (symptomatic bradycar- dia and tachycardia), a thorough evaluation may be necessary to identify the underlying condition responsible for the abnormal vital signs (e.g.,dehydration, hypovolemia, infection). Temperature Oral temperature readings can be falsely low in patients with an elevated respiratory rate. Inquire about recent antipyretic (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications) use, because thesemedications may mask a febrile episode. This may be especially impor- tant in an infant younger than 3 months of age whose entire workup may be based on whether he or she is febrile (temperature > 38\u00baC or100.4\u00baF). Septic patients, particularly the very young and very old, may not mount a febrile response to an infection and may on occasion present as hypothermic. Central nervous system injury, drug abuse, adrenal in-sufficiency, end-stage renal disease, and thyroid disorders can also affect basal body temperature or temperature regulation. Pulse The heart rate (HR) must be interpreted with attention to the age of the patient, especially when caring for infants and small children. Tachycar-dia in one age group may very well be a normal finding, whereas in another, it may be pathologic. Conversely, a well-conditioned athlete may have a resting HR in the 40s. For adolescents and adults, the maxi-mum sustained HR can be estimated with the following formula: maximum sustained HR = (220 - age in years) \u00d7 0.85 Take, for example, two patients. The first is 25 years old; the other is 85 years old. Each has a HR of 140 beats per minute. As you can see, using Case Study Consider the patient who fell at home. He is an elderly male who slipped in the bathroom, striking his head . The care provided should entail a rapid evaluation of his airway, breathing, and circulation whil e simultaneously applying cervical spine stabilization, obtaining vital signs, inserting a peripheral IV line , and performing a focused secondary examination looking to uncover other potential traumatic injuries o r neurologic impairment. A brief medical history may uncover information that can have a profound effec t on how this patient would be initially cared for. If he were taking warfarin, it would be prudent to obtain an emergent CT scan of the head even if the patient had a normal neurologic examination. If the patien t reported dizziness or palpitations before the fall, a cardiac workup might be necessary. The quick decision s that need to be made in this case\u2014\"Is his airway patent?\" \"Does he need an urgent CT scan of the heador cervical spine?\" \"Does he need an ECG, cardiac monitoring, and the like?\"\u2014are all crucial decision s that should be made at the bedside during the first few minutes of his evaluation. These decisions are a ll being made in parallel with the treatment necessary to stabilize the patient.The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 41this formula, an HR this fast is much more concerning in the elderly patient, regardless of the cause. The pulse also has to be taken in contextwith other vital signs. The HR increases by approximately 10 beats per minute for each degree Fahrenheit of temperature elevation above nor- mal. In addition, patients taking medications that slow conductionthrough the atrioventricular node ( -blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin) may not mount a tachycardic response to physiologic stress. Respiratory Rate Count the rate yourself with a watch. Not everyone has a respiratory rate of 20 beats per minute. Infants are commonly noted to be periodic breath-ers. For these patients, it is necessary to count the respiratory rate for 30 seconds to 1 minute to get a more accurate measurement. The respirato- ry rate tells only one side of the story and provides little information asto the oxygenation or ventilatory status of the patient. Close attention needs to be paid to the respiratory effort, including the presence of re- tractions, accessory muscle use, and adventitious breath sounds. Alsoremember that some patients will have pulmonary manifestations of sys- temic disease states resulting in tachypnea (respiratory rate > 20 per minute; sepsis, pulmonary embolism, diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acido-sis, and salicylate toxicity). Blood Pressure Do not confuse the concept of \"stability\" with normal blood pressure. Hypotension is a late sign of shock; this is especially true in children. In cases of class II hemorrhage (loss of 15%-30% blood volume), findingsusually include tachycardia, tachypnea, cool clammy skin, delayed cap- illary refill, and a decrease in pulse pressure, yet the systolic blood pres- sure (BP) may be in the normal range. The decrease in pulse pressureoccurs because of increased levels of circulating catecholamines causing an increase in peripheral vascular resistance, thus raising diastolic BP. These patients are in compensated shock. BP readings as well as other vital signs such as heart rate also have to be taken in context with the age of the patient. In infants and young chil- dren, it is common for the normal BP reading to be lower than adolescentsand adults. A formula for estimating the BP in young children is as follows: BP = 80 + (2 \u00d7 age in years) In adults, elevated BP readings in the emergency department are as com- mon as in the adult ambulatory population. Some of these readings are transient, reflecting the clinical scenario at hand, and do not necessarily indicate underlying hypertension. Rarely do isolated elevated BP read-ings need to be urgently addressed in the emergency department. Orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic vital signs in general are used in the bedside assessment of patients with known or suspected fluid loss,syncope, intravascular volume depletion, or autonomic dysfunction. At times, the use and misuse of orthostatic vital sign measurements revolve around the misinterpretation of the results, confusion as to what actual-ly constitutes a positive finding, and the technique used to determine the measurements. A more in-depth review of this topic can be found in Roberts and Hedges' Clinical Procedures in Emergency Medicine (2004). Pulse Oximetry Sometimes referred to as the fifth vital sign is a simple-to-perform, accu- rate, noninvasive assessment of the oxygen saturation (SaO2). The SaO2 correlates well with the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), the42 \u0083 Developing Your Plan of Actionrelationship being described by the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. Despite its many advantages, pulse oximetry monitoring has some limi-tations. Although it is a noninvasive measurement of oxygenation sta- tus, no information is provided regarding the ventilatory status of the patient. In cases of suspected hypercarbia, an ABG analysis should beperformed to determine the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2). In addition, pulse oximetry measurements can be only as accu- rate as empiric calibration curves. SaO2 values less than approximately 75% to 80% may be inaccurate because they are commonly extrapolated from healthy volunteer control subjects. The presence of both carboxy- hemoglobin (COHb) and methemoglobin (MetHb) can have significanteffects on pulse oximetry readings when present in elevated concentra- tions. In patients with elevated COHb levels, pulse oximetry typically overestimates the SaO 2. For approximately every 1% of COHb, the pulse oximeter overestimates the SaO2 by approximately 1%. Because of light absorbance qualities, in the presence of high concentrations of MetHb, the SaO2 as measured by pulse oximetry will approximate 85%. When either of these conditions is suspected, it is recommended to check an arterial or venous blood sample using a co-oximeter. Other factors affect- ing pulse oximetry readings include bright ambient or infrared light,peripheral vasoconstriction, motion artifact, and dark nail polish. Lastly, because it is possible to have a delayed detection of an hypoxic event, do not solely rely on pulse oximetry to determine oxygenation status. Conclusion This chapter represents a starting point from where you should approacha patient when you are formulating your plan of action. The attention paid to your primary survey and secondary survey, vital signs, and the gestalt of \"sick versus not sick\" will be crucial to guide your initial diag-nostic evaluation and need for therapeutic intervention.

Is It Necessary? Although the goal of establishing a definitive diagnosis appears logi- cal in the vast majority of emergency department-patient encoun- ters, the reality is that this is a nearly impossible task and often an unrealistic expectation of the general public. Accepting the humbling na- ture and at times the uncertainty of the specialty of emergency medicine is absolutely necessary. A closer examination of the challenges and goals ofour specialty offers a distinct perspective on the ability to and the impor- tance of establishing a definitive diagnosis in the emergency department. The overarching goal in the practice of medicine is to assess a pa- tient's signs and symptoms and perform the necessary evaluation to achieve a clear diagnosis and thereby initiate treatment. In the prac- tice of emergency medicine, however, some patients are admitted tothe hospital and others are discharged home without a definitive diagnosis. Although this may sound frustrating and even deficient when first contemplated, examining the goals of the emergency de-partment help shed light on why this happens. The primary role of the emergency department is, by definition, to handle \"emergency medical conditions.\" What, then, constitutes an emergency? Al-though this topic has been extensively debated, the term emergency medical condition means a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) suchthat the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in (EMTALA): \u0084Placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeop- ardy \u0084Serious impairment to bodily functions \u0084Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part \u0084With respect to a pregnant woman who is having contractions - that there is inadequate time to effect a safe transfer to another hospital before delivery - that transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the woman or the unborn child An emergency is any condition in which a patient is likely to suffer morbidity or mortality if left undiagnosed and untreated. The goal,The primary role of the emergency department is, by definition, tohandle \"emergency medical condi-tions.\"44 \u0083 Diagnosis\u2014Is It Possible? Is It Necessary?therefore, when assessing a patient who presents to the emergency department, is to identify and treat conditions that could result in morbidity and mortality if left undiagnosed and untreated. It is withthis in mind that we assess the importance of establishing a defini- tive diagnosis. After evaluating an emergency department patient, a clinician generates a differential diagnosis on the basis of the information gathered and the results of selected bedside tests (e.g., accu check, urine dipstick, urine pregnancy, pulse oximetry, peak flow). An appropriate differential diag-nosis should include any potentially life-threatening conditions along with other more common causes of the patient's presenting complaint. Steps are then taken to rule out any possible life-threatening conditions.Reasonable efforts are often made to arrive at a definitive diagnosis; how- ever, quite often, the emergency department workup fails to identify the cause of the patient's symptoms. The case study on this page provides aspecific example that may help illustrate this scenario better. Patients may feel dissatisfied when the emergency department physician cannot provide a definitive diagnosis for their complaint. Reassuring thepatient that there is not a serious cause of their symptoms while acknowl- edging their concern may help. Sometimes an explanation as to the lim- itations of the emergency department evaluation may help allay thepatient's frustrations and fears. Patients should always be encouraged to follow up with their primary care provider when any ambiguity in mak- ing a definitive diagnosis occurs. Discharge instructions should empha-size the importance of prompt outpatient follow-up. In summary, identifying a definitive diagnosis, although desired by pa- tients and fulfilling for clinicians to provide, is often elusive. The funda-mental goal of an emergency department assessment is to exclude harmful or life-threatening conditions whose diagnosis should not be delayed. Suggested Reading Social Security Online.

Accessed March 6, 2008. This Web site reviews the important aspects of EMTALA.Case Study Consider a middle-aged man who presents to the emergency department with chest pain. The emergenc y physician should consider all of the life-threatening causes of chest pain when evaluating such a patient : myocardial ischemia/infarction, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, pneumonia, pneumothorax, to name a few. As the clinician gathers data from the patient's H&PE and ancillary testing, he or she wi ll assess how likely each of these diagnoses is and will decide which, if any of these need to be evaluatedfurther before the patient may be discharged safely or admitted to the hospital. In some cases, all that ma y need to be performed is a thorough H&PE. In other cases, the patient may require a chest radiograph, ECG , D-Dimer testing, or a CT angiogram. Every case is different, and the use of resources and the extent of th e diagnostic evaluation should be guided by the differential diagnosis.CHAPTER 13 Disposition of the Emergency DepartmentPatient Disposition (admission vs. discharge) is, of course, the ultimate endpoint for all emergency department visits. However, this does not mean you should begin to think about it toward the end of the patient encounter. On the contrary, a good clinician thinks about patient disposition from the moment he or she enters the room. Imagine you pick up the chart of a 64-year-old male patient with a history ofdiabetes and hypercholesterolemia who presents to the emergency de- partment with chest pain and shortness of breath. Even before you walk into the patient's room, you should start to think about the differentialdiagnosis, diagnostic workup, therapeutic management, and of course disposition. By reviewing the \"stopgaps\" in the admission process, the concept of timely disposition can be placed in better context. In a typical ambulato- ry presentation to the emergency department, a patient undergoes a tri- age assessment, usually by a nurse, followed by a brief interview by aregistrar to obtain medical insurance and other demographic informa- tion. These steps may at times take 30 minutes or more. Next, depending on the availability of a treatment room, the presentation of unexpectedemergencies, and staffing resources, a patient may still wait in the wait- ing room for some time before being brought back to the emergency department for an evaluation. After a patient is brought back into thetreatment area, he or she is often reevaluated by a nurse before being evaluated by a physician. Add to this the time it takes to perform a H&PE, obtain a chest radiograph, draw blood, wait for test results, and more,you could easily add 2 or 3 or additional hours to the patient's stay be- fore disposition is addressed. Assuming all of these steps are performed in series, you can easily see how a patient presenting with what initiallyappeared to be a nonurgent complaint can spend many hours in the emergency department. This timeline does not take into account the time that some patients must then endure as they wait in the emergencydepartment for an inpatient bed to become available. If some of these steps are performed in parallel\u2014that is, bedside registration, nursing stand- ing orders for selected clinical presentations, early disposition for thestraightforward admission\u2014many hours could easily be taken off the back end, and a patient could be expedited through the system with much more efficiency. The case study on the next page gives an example of planning for disposition early.

Of course, the best dis- position for a patient is not always clear cut. Some patients will be admitted without a clear diagnosis, whereas others require admis-sion because of social or other contributing factors. A number of these issues and contributing factors need to be considered that may affect the ultimate disposition of a patient: \u0084Access to follow-up health care \u0084Ability to fill medication prescriptions \u0084Level of functional independence or ability to ambulate \u0084Ability of the patient to care for himself or herself at home (e.g., ac- tivities of daily living, dressing, bathing) \u0084Family and social support network \u0084Suspicion of child or elder abuse Once you have decided to admit a patient to the hospital, the next step will be to determine which service he or she should be admitted to. Inmany cases, this will be obvious\u2014a patient with acute appendicitis should be admitted to the surgery service, a patient with chest pain who re- quires a cardiac rule-out should be admitted to the medicine service. Butsometimes this will not be clear. When these situations arise, you will need to be your patient's advocate to avoid or minimize conflict as to who will care for the patient. For example, an elderly patient suffers a hipfracture after a fall. Should this patient be admitted to the orthopedic service with an internal medicine consult to manage her hypertension and diabetes? Or would she be better served by being admitted to themedicine service to manage her comorbidities and have the orthopedic consultant manage the hip fracture? It may prove helpful at times to involve the patient's primary care physician. He or she would certainlywant to be updated on the patient's condition and may have a preferred referral pattern that can help mitigate these potential disposition con- flicts. Finally, you will have to decide what type of hospital bed a patientwill need, that is, a medical-surgical floor bed, telemetry monitoring, step-down bed, or an intensive care unit (ICU) bed. This decision is often based on the stability of the patient; the expected course of the acuteillness; and the need for cardiac monitoring, intensive nursing care, and the like. Some of the nuances of an ICU bed versus a step-down bed or a step-down bed versus a telemetry bed may be institution dependent andshould always be determined on a case-by-case basis. In addition, con- Case Study Imagine you pick up the chart of a 64-year-old male patient with a history of diabetes and hypercholesterolemia who presents to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath . Even before you walk into the patient's room, you should start to think about the differential diagnosis , diagnostic workup, therapeutic management, and of course disposition. A patient such as this should b e immediately brought back to the treatment area. The initial nursing assessment and registration could b e performed at the bedside. In a high-functioning emergency department, this patient should have an ECGperformed, be connected to a cardiac monitor, and often have IV access initiated before a formal evaluationby a physician. In this type of case, the eventual disposition can be made early on in his evaluation. Inmany institutions, a preliminary admission order can be made before obtaining the results of all diagnosti c studies.As a patient care advocate, we need to ensure that a patient fully un-derstands the benefit of hospital-ization and appropriate treatmentand the risk of leaving AMA . . .

By doing so, the patient can make an informed decision. To make this decision, we must ensure to the best of our abilitythat the patient has medical decisionmaking capacity. All reasonable ef- forts should be used to help resolve issues surrounding the patient leav- ing AMA. At times, a patient may just be frustrated or hungry, concernedabout the hospital bill, or perhaps concerned about missing work. Some of these issues may be able to be resolved, others cannot. If a patient is going to leave AMA, it is best to develop an alternative treatment planthat the patient can adhere to, including the need for close outpatient follow-up or return to the emergency department for reevaluation. Writ- ten documentation in the medical record should detail the conversationthat the physician and patient had regarding the risks of leaving and the benefits of hospitalization. If you encounter a patient who wants to leave AMA, always alert your supervisor. In summary, keep the disposition of the patient in mind early in the course of the evaluation. If expedited in a timely fashion, proper disposi- tion may lead to improved patient care and satisfaction with the emer-gency department evaluation.CHAPTER 14 Discharge Instructions Three quarters or more of the patients cared for in a busy emer- gency department will be discharged home, some after a brief evaluation, others after a more extensive evaluation and hours of observation. For the many patients discharged, outpatient follow-up and reevaluation are required to provide \"closure\" for the pre- senting complaint. The importance of providing adequate discharge instructions to communicate with both patients and primary carephysicians cannot be overstated. Discharge instructions serve a number of important purposes. They in- form the patient of the known, suspected, or preliminary diagnosis and the name of their treating physician. In addition, properly written dis- charge instructions can inform the patient and his or her primary carephysician about the extent of the evaluation performed, including pre- liminary diagnostic test results and medications administered in the emer- gency department. This may also be of help when a patient returnsunexpectedly to the same or another emergency department. Discharge instructions can also outline a plan for outpatient follow-up care with the patient's primary care physician and can explain circumstances un-der which a patient should return to the emergency department. Near the top of most standardized discharge instructions is a space to enter the patient's diagnosis; the diagnosis may need to be entered inwriting or through an electronic discharge instruction system. Care must be taken in choosing the proper wording for a discharge diagnosis. A patient's definitive diagnosis is sometimes not known at the time of dis-charge from the emergency department. A definitive diagnosis, such as \"strep throat,\" should be listed only when this diagnosis is in fact known (i.e., in a patient with sore throat and a positive rapid strep test). Formany clinicians, there is a temptation to list diagnoses that are suspected but not confirmed. A patient with vomiting and diarrhea may have viral gastroenteritis; however, the vomiting and diarrhea may also representan atypical presentation of early appendicitis. When discharging such a patient, the safe practice is to list \"vomiting and diarrhea\" as the diagno- sis. After a listing of the diagnosis in the discharge instructions, it is help-ful to briefly summarize the evaluation and treatment that was performed, diagnostic test results, and medications administered. The next part of the discharge instructions should delineate a treatment plan for the patient. Although the treatment plan is often verbally re- viewed with the patient before discharge, patients will frequently forgetThe importance of providing adequate discharge instructions tocommunicate with both patientsand primary care physicians cannotbe overstated.The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 49elements of the plan if they are not written down. For example, the treatment plan for a patient with an ankle sprain might include the following: \"Apply ice to ankle for 20 minutes at a time, 4 to 5 times per day. Elevate your leg to minimize swelling. Use crutches as needed forcomfort.\" Medications are often part of the treatment plan and should be clearly explained. For example, \"Take ibuprofen 600 mg (1 tablet) for pain every 8 hours with a full meal.\" Another component of written discharge instructions is a clearly stated plan for follow-up care. Specify with whom the patient should follow up and in how many days follow-up should occur. If needed, provide the appropriate specialty clinic phone number for the patient. Remember,based on the type of health insurance, some patients may need to obtain a referral from their primary care physician before they will be able to follow up with a specialist. The final component of the discharge instructions is perhaps the most important. This includes an explanation of reasons to return to the emer- gency department. This section should list any relevant symptoms the patient should watch for and should include a generic statement thatencourages the patient to seek medical care immediately for any con- cerning symptoms. For example, a patient with minor head trauma might be discharged with the following instructions: \"Return immediately ifyou develop vomiting, worse headache, weakness or numbness, visual changes, difficulty speaking or walking, confusion, or for any other con- cerns.\" Several factors contribute to well-written discharge instructions. All dis- charge instructions should be written in language that can be easily un- derstood by a layperson. It is important to avoid the use of medical jargon. Research suggests that, in general, when providing written health care information, the contents should be written at the sixth-grade reading level. The majority of patients seen in the emergency department do nothave medical training and will not understand \"CXR neg,\" \"f/u w/PCP in 2d,\" \"Keflex 500 mg PO QID,\" or many of the other abbreviations we routinely use. Anticipatory guidance about the proper use of newly pre-scribed medications, particularly analgesics, is important to limit the like- lihood of side effects. It is also of importance to realize that an estimated 50% of the adult US population\u2014approximately 90 million people\u2014have low health literacyand may have difficulty understanding health-related information pro- vided by a physician, including written discharge instructions (Ruddell, 2006). It has been further estimated that 1 in 5 adults cannot read thefront page of a newspaper (Ruddell, 2006). In addition, a strong inverse relationship exists between increasing age of the population and low health literacy. According to the 2000 US population census, more than 11% ofthe population (30 million people) was born outside of the United States (Ruddell, 2006). Approximately 21 million of these immigrants exhibit limited English proficiency (LEP; limited ability to speak, understand, reador write English) (Ruddell, 2006). Patients exhibiting LEP present a num- ber of obstacles to the health care provider regarding diagnosis and man- agement. Language barriers can lead to a lack of adherence to specifiedtreatment plans and have been associated with more emergency depart- ment patient visits. Just as interpreter services are used to communicate with a patient during his or her evaluation, interpreter services should beused to review instructions before discharge. If available, have the dis- charge instructions translated into the patient's primary language. Another important component of well-written discharge instructions is that they clearly explain any outstanding test results that need follow-50 \u0083 Discharge Instructionsup. For example, depending on the practice pattern of your particular hospital, a final radiology interpretation by an attending radiologist maynot be available at the time of the patient's discharge. An appropriate way to communicate this to the patient may be, \"Preliminary review of the CT scan of your head did not show any acute abnormality. Pleasefollow up with your primary care physician to obtain the official inter- pretation of this study.\" Likewise, although a rapid strep test may be negative in the emergency department, a formal throat culture, if taken,may still be pending at the time the patient is discharged, and the pa- tient must be instructed on how to follow up on this result. In summary, discharge instructions play several critical roles. They help a patient understand what is known about their condition and what was done for them in the emergency department. They also provide a plan for treatment and follow-up and reasons to return to the emergency de-partment. Taking the time to generate well-thought-out discharge in- structions is a habit that should be formed early. Suggested Reading Ruddell J.

The medical record allows us to communicate with our colleagues and can provide a glimpse into the caregiver's thought process. Traditionally, entries in the medical record are handwritten. However, depending on the resources and system used at your particular facility,the \"emergency department treatment record\" may be dictated and transcribed or computer generated. Some institutions may use a complaint-based templated charting system (either handwritten orelectronic) to promote accurate documentation. An advantage of templated charting systems is that they prompt the caregiver to answer patient-related questions that may enhance and streamline the codingand billing process. A disadvantage or limitation of the pure templated chart is that it is mostly a checkbox and slash documentation tool that provides little opportunity for the care provider to document in paragraphform his or her thought process. When a templated chart is reviewed days or weeks later, it may be difficult to get a true sense of the patient presentation. An example of a templated emergency department chartfor a complaint of chest pain can be found at www.tsystem.com/library/ media/images/sample-ep-chest-pain-front.jpg. Handwritten charts have their advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage of a handwritten chart is the ability to document in the med- ical record in real time at the bedside as care is being provided. The chart can be completed in parallel to providing patient care. However, a num-ber of limitations exist with handwritten charts; first and foremost is legibility. Illegible or confusing handwriting by clinicians in addition to the use of dangerous medication abbreviations has been shown to be anunderlying factor associated with many medication errors. Another lim- itation can be the variability of thoroughness or completeness of the medical record. With handwritten charts, the depth of the documenta-tion is very dependent on the practitioner. Some practitioners will take the approach of documenting the minimum necessary information to achieve a particular billing level or to convey the pertinent facts of thecase. Time constraints also may affect the depth of documentation. Brief or minimal documentation does not necessarily reflect a lack of atten- tion to detail. Regardless of the method of documentation used to complete the emer- gency department treatment record, the principles of documentationThe medical record should be used to document the patient's encoun-ter with the goal of communicat-ing your thought process in amanner that can be helpful to fu-ture practitioners caring for thatparticular patient. It is important that the emergency department treatment record reflectthe full extent of the evaluation andtreatment performed in the emer-gency department.52 \u0083 Documentationare the same. The medical record should be used to document the patient's encounter with the goal of communicating your thought process in amanner that can be helpful to future practitioners caring for that particu- lar patient. Each encounter should be documented and at a minimum contain pertinent elements of the H&PE, assessment, and plan. This isthe \"SOAP note\" format (subjective, objective, assessment, plan). Your approach to completing the medical record should mirror your approach to performing the H&PE\u2014focused but thorough. However, as a medicalstudent, documentation in the medical record, specifically in the emer- gency department, may be limited because of guidelines set forth for teach- ing physicians by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Theseguidelines can be viewed at www.cms.hhs.gov/MLNProducts/downloads/ gdelinesteachgresfctsht.pdf. A brief review of these guidelines follows. A medical student may docu- ment services in the treatment record; however, the teaching physician may refer only to the student's documentation of an evaluation and management service that is related to the ROS and past medical, family,and social history. The teaching physician must verify and document the HPI, the physical examination, and the medical decisionmaking pro- cess. These guidelines do not necessarily curtail the degree of involve-ment that students have with a patient or limit their autonomy. Although your ability to document in the emergency department treatment record may be limited, your understanding of the importance of proper docu-mentation is nonetheless essential. Please check with your clerkship di- rector to clarify the documentation guidelines for the particular clinical site to which you are assigned. A template H&PE form that you can usefor your emergency department patient encounters is included at the end of this section. It is important that the emergency department treatment record reflect the full extent of the evaluation and treatment performed in the emer- gency department. Remember that the patient's chart contains more than just the physician's note. It contains other equally important elements,such as registration data, nursing notes and assessments, and prehospital run sheets, if applicable. You also have the added responsibility of re- viewing this information, specifically nursing and prehospital notes, foraccuracy or any discrepancies. The following are a few helpful hints for documentation: \u0084Date and time all of your notes in the medical record. \u0084Write your notes legibly. \u0084If you make a mistake, draw one line through it and sign your initials. \u0084Document a focused but thorough H&PE. \u0084Document vital signs and address abnormalities. \u0084Document the results of all diagnostic tests you have ordered. \u0084When you speak to a consultant, document name and times. \u0084Document the patient's response to therapy. \u0084Document repeat examinations. \u0084Document your thought process (medical decisionmaking). \u0084Never write derogatory comments in the medical record. \u0084Never change or add comments to the medical record after the fact. It may be appropriate to add an addendum, but only if it is properlytimed and dated.Remember the time honored saying, \"If it isn't documented, itdidn't happen.\"The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 53\u0084Document your procedures. \u0084If a patient leaves AMA, document that you have explained the spe- cific risks of leaving AMA. \u0084Document plans for outpatient care and follow-up. Last, in the event of an unanticipated bad outcome, patient complica- tion, or death, the chart in its entirety may be reviewed in a peer-review process or in a malpractice suit if the case proceeds to litigation. In these situations, your documentation serves as your main defense. Rememberthe time honored saying, \"If it isn't documented, it didn't happen.\" Keep in mind that, at times, you may have a difference of opinion with a colleague or a less-than-professional interaction with a consultant. If thisoccurs, it is never acceptable to use the medical record to fight with col- leagues\u2014the so called \"chart wars.\" If a consultant is not answering a page, simply note, \"At the time of this dictation, Dr. XXX has not calledback.\" Similarly, if you disagree with a consultant's plan, document this using nonjudgmental language. It can also be helpful to record the spe- cific times of certain events in complicated cases or to add addendumnotes if the condition of the patient changes or if the patient is in the emergency department for an extended period of time. Adherence to coding and billing guidelines will also influence documen- tation. Although a review of these guidelines is beyond the scope of this Primer, recognize that patients are billed according to the complexity of their visit. To substantiate this billing, there must be enough documen-tation of the H&PE and medical decisionmaking elements to support the level of care provided. Although you are developing your own personal style of documenta- tion, consider who will be potentially reading your chart (e.g., other medical students, billing personnel, nurses, residents, attendings, and possibly lawyers). By doing so, it will become more clear what your doc-umentation should and should not consist of. In addition, you should never write anything in the medical record that you would be uncom- fortable having shown to a jury. Although it might seem like an addedburden at times, especially during a busy shift, proper documentation is of paramount importance. Suggested Reading Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 55CHAPTER 16 Enhancing Your Oral CasePresentation Skills From an educational standpoint,your case presentations allow thepreceptor to gauge your under-standing of the case.The ability to present a case in a clear, concise, and organized fash ion is a skill in and of itself separate from the ability to obtain a detailed H&PE. Because few medical interviews are directly ob- served, the oral case presentation serves as a surrogate assessment of yourability to perform an accurate H&PE, to analyze and synthesize relevant clinical data, and to formulate a well-thought-out treatment plan. From an educational standpoint, your case presentations allow the preceptorto gauge your understanding of the case. This is important to remember because most of the educational discussion with your preceptor revolves around your presentation. Regarding your presentation, your preceptorgenerally has two fundamental goals. The first will be to focus on patient-related issues to better understand what is wrong with the pa- tient. The second will be to ascertain your understanding of the case tofocus his or her teaching points better. Your preceptor will be asking you questions that are patient centered and diagnosis driven. He or she will be functioning as an expert consultant and will focus on areas of thepresentation that require further clarification or areas that were missed. Your preceptor will ask questions to further clarify specific aspects of the HPI, such as onset, location, duration, quality, aggravating or alleviatingfactors, and the like. Your preceptor may also ask you direct questions to better access your knowledge base. \"What antibiotics should we use to treat this patient?\" \"What is the differential diagnosis of right upper quad-rant pain?\" Alternatively, your preceptor may inquire about your overall assessment of the case by asking you, \"What do you think is wrong with the patient?\" or \"What diagnostic studies should we order?\" Questionssuch as these are higher order questions and explore your clinical rea- soning and problem-solving abilities. Your case presentations in the emergency department should generally be brief and focused. The traditional case presentation should include a directed opening statement. Included in the opening statement should be the patient's chief complaint and any pertinent past medical history.For example\u2014 Mr. Brown is a 54-year-old male with a history of hyperten- sion and noninsulin-dependent diabetes who presents withleft-sided exertional chest pain and shortness of breath. By linking pertinent information early in your presentation, your preceptor can better focus on the case. After the opening statement,you should present a more detailed description of the HPI and perti-56 \u0083 Enhancing Your Oral Case Presentation Skillsnent ROS. An important point to remember is that some informa- tion obtained during the medical interview will, in retrospect, beextraneous and not relevant to the presenting complaint. Through- out your presentation, it is necessary to focus on aspects of the med- ical history that are relevant to the presenting complaint and toexclude irrelevant information. Additional information that should be included in the traditional case presentation is a detailed past medical history, medications, allergies, a directed physical examina-tion, diagnostic impression, and a diagnostic and treatment plan. Although exceptions exist, most cases can be presented in 2 to 3 minutes. This is in stark contrast to the more comprehensive formatused for inpatient case presentations, which typically are much longer. An alternative approach is the assessment-oriented case presentation. Cas- es that lend themselves well to this approach are those in which thediagnosis is or appears to be straightforward. The presentation begins, rather than ends, with your assessment and plan, followed by informa- tion that supports your conclusions. This style of case presentation iscommonly used by physicians with more clinical experience\u2014mid-level and senior residents. When using an assessment-oriented presentation style, the directed opening statement should include the diagnostic im-pression followed by a treatment plan. For example\u2014 Mr. Brown is a 54-year-old male who presents with what seems to be cardiac chest pain. I would like to obtain an ECG, chestradiograph, cardiac enzymes, give him an aspirin, and admit him to a monitored bed for a cardiac rule-out. After this opening statement, additional historical data, including perti- nent positive and negative features, can then be presented that supports the clinical assessment. For example\u2014 He presents with left-sided exertional chest pain described as pres- sure and shortness of breath. His chest pain started approximate- ly 2 hours ago while climbing stairs and was relieved after resting, and so forth. It is common for assessment-oriented case presentations to be used when calling an emergency department patient in to the admission team or when discussing a case with a consultant. Admission or consultant pre-sentations have a different focus than standard or traditional case pre- sentations. When a consultant is contacted, a provisional or preliminary diagnosis has usually been made, and you are calling the consultant toassist in the care of the patient. It will be helpful to your consultant if early in your discussion, you make him or her aware of why you are calling. A typical exchange would be as follows: Hello, this is Michael Stevens. I am a senior medical student work- ing in the emergency department with Dr. Tarver. I am calling you about a patient that we would like you to see in consultation.Our patient is a previously healthy, 38-year-old, right-hand dom- inant male. His name is Richard Seaver. He has a displaced mid- shaft fracture of his right radius and ulna that occurred afterslipping on the ice approximately 1 hour ago. His distal pulses are intact, and he can move all of his fingers. We have placed his forearm in a volar splint. This type of presentation is focused and contains relevant information that will be requested by the consultant. If the consultant would like additional information, it can easily be provided. By providing clinicallyrelevant information in this assessment-oriented fashion, we are not over- burdening our consultant or an admitting team with a lengthy presenta-Case presentations in the emer- gency department should gener-ally be brief and focused. When using an assessment- oriented presentation style, thedirected opening statementshould include the diagnostic im-pression followed by a treatmentplan.The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 57tion over the telephone that is difficult to follow. It is good form to speak to the admitting team or consultant in more depth in person to answerany questions that they may have. The assessment-oriented presentation is also commonly used by emer- gency medicine residents and attending physicians during sign in-signout rounds. Typically, when an attending physician transfers the care of his or her patients to the incoming attending, he or she will be caring for patients who have an established diagnosis and who will be admitted tothe hospital and others with a preliminary diagnosis and pending diag- nostic studies. At times, it may be necessary to sign out a dozen or more patients. Because of the patient volume and time constraints, it is neces-sary to focus the \"sign outs\" to the relevant information: known or pre- liminary diagnosis, pending diagnostic studies, likely disposition, and any other matters that need to be addressed. Finally, each preceptor has his or her own unique reasoning process and preferences regarding the style of case presentation expected from a stu- dent. Because of the limited preceptor continuity during your emergen-cy medicine clerkship, you will work with supervisors with different teaching styles and different expectations. Some expect more informa- tion, some expect less. Some faculty members will remember many de-tails; others may ask you for information that you were about to provide or have already covered. There are few absolutes regarding styles of case presentations. Some physicians prefer the \"cut-to-the-chase\" approach;others prefer the organized chronologic detailed case presentation, where- as others may have you present the case at the patient's bedside.

In addi-tion, we must relay important patient-related health information to the inpatient service assuming care of our admitted patients. Com- munication is also necessary to facilitate follow-up care after a pa-tient is discharged from the emergency department. Many times this task can be accomplished with clearly stated written discharge in- structions; however, a phone call to the patient's primary care pro-vider or to a specialist may be needed to facilitate follow-up care in a timely fashion. It is therefore imperative that we communicate effec- tively with other members of the health care team. Consultation is a necessary and essential part of the practice of emergen- cy medicine. Because of the challenges we face providing care across the spectrum of age and illness, emergency physicians rely on the consulta-tion process to assist in delivering high-quality health care. \"Emergency department consults\" vary in urgency from the routine nonurgent con- sult to the \"stat\" consult, in which a specialist is needed at the bedside ofa patient requiring an emergent procedure or operation. For effective consultation to occur, students must better understand the process. Con- sultations are often initiated over the phone. Some occur during routinebusiness hours, whereas others unfortunately occur in the middle of the night. Keep this in mind, as many of our professional colleagues are not \"shift workers\" like most emergency physicians, and many will have clin-ical responsibilities the next day. For this reason, do not burden consult- ants with routine or nonurgent phone calls during sleeping hours. From the consultant's stand point (and rightly so), nonurgent patient evalua-tions or procedures can often wait until the next morning. That being said, in an emergency, do not hesitate to involve a specialist if his or her services are required to assist in the care of the patient, regardless of thetime of day. Effective communication is one of the keys to a mutually beneficial interaction and relationship with your consultant. As a general rule,consider the following when talking with a consultant: \u0084Speak clearly and start slowly, especially if you've woken a consultantfrom sleep. \u0084Introduce yourself by name as a medical student and give the name of your supervising resident or faculty.The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 59All consultations should be initiated with a goal in mind. Effective com-munication is one of the keys to amutually beneficial interaction andrelationship with your consultant.\u0084 Learn with whom you are speaking (name, service, position), not only to document this information but also to confirm that you are speak- ing with the correct person or service. \u0084Be respectful and expect respect in return. \u0084Be focused and direct with your presentation. Often, it is best to begin with a diagnosis (known or suspected) rather than the traditional case presentation. For example, you may startyour assessment-oriented presentation to your surgical consultant with the following: Hi Dr. Stevens, I am Michael Jones, a senior medical student work- ing with Dr. Taylor in the emergency department. We are consult- ing you on a 24-year-old male who we are concerned has acute appendicitis. He presents with approximately 4 hours of abdomi-nal pain that has migrated to his right lower quadrant associated with a fever of 101 \u00baF, nausea, and anorexia. On physical exami- nation, his heart rate is 88, his blood pressure is 136/84 mm Hg, and he has rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant. We would like you to come to the emergency department to evaluate him. \u0084Be flexible with your presentation style. \u0084With experience, you will realize that some consultants prefer adetailed presentation, whereas others are satisfied with a focusedpresentation over the phone and a more detailed presentation at the bedside. \u0084Speak your consultants' languages, and tailor the presentation to the specific service. \u0084Whether you are describing a fracture for an orthopedist or interpret-ing an ECG for a cardiologist, it is necessary to communicate effec-tively to facilitate the best patient care. \u0084All consultations should be initiated with a goal in mind. This goalmay range from facilitating an admission to a particular service, a rec-ommendation for antibiotics or a bedside consultation. At times, it will be necessary to explain to the consultant exactly why you are calling him or her. Keeping this in mind; excellent communicationskills will work in your favor. Remember, a subtle yet important dis- tinction exists between telling a surgical consultant \"you need to take this patient to the operating room\" versus \"I have a patient that Ibelieve needs to go to the operating room.\" \u0084Summarize the expectations or agreements communicated at theend of your conversation. This should help avoid any misunder-standings. Examples might include how urgently the patient needs to be seen or how long before the consultant expects to see the patient in the emergency department. This is also a good time toclarify whether the consultant has further questions or needs ad- ditional information. \u0084Document the discussion with your consultant. Include the consultant's name, service, time you spoke, and a brief notation regarding the con- versation (i.e., \"9:00 PM, case discussed with Dr. Michaels, orthopedics. He will be down to see the patient in 30 minutes.\"). Keeping these points in mind, the effective partnership establishedbetween emergency physicians, consultants, and primary care phy-60 \u0083 Interacting With Consultants and Primary Care PhysiciansOutstanding communication and interpersonal skills are necessary tobe a successful clinician.sicians will undoubtedly result in improved health care outcomes for all patients who present to the emergency department for un-scheduled care. However, despite our best efforts, there are times when an interaction with a professional colleague is challenging. Some of these situations may result because of time pressures and workloadfrustrations and should not be taken personally. Other times, chal- lenging interactions may occur as a result of differences of profes- sional opinion, different expectations, or, on rare occasion,unprofessional behavior. It is important to emphasize that, if an in- teraction occurs with a colleague that you view as unprofessional (i.e., condescending language), avoid the tendency to be unprofes-sional in return. If a situation such as this should arise, it is always of utmost importance to keep in mind the patient's best interest and well-being. In summary, outstanding communication and interpersonal skills are necessary to be a successful clinician. In many ways, putting forth the effort to have collegial working relationships with your professional col-leagues is as important as striving to enhance patient satisfaction. Like any other activity in medicine, the art of consultation and communica- tion is important for patient care and consultant or primary care physi-cian satisfaction. If necessary, rehearse your presentation with your supervising faculty or resident before presenting the case to a consultant. Discuss the most important features of the case, including strategies touse if specific questions or concerns are raised. Be direct and concise, clearly expressing your goals to the consultant or primary care physi- cian. Flexibility with your communication style is crucial, because con-sultants from different specialties generally prefer emergency department presentations to have slightly different styles. Because consultants and primary care providers are integral to emergency medicine practice, learn-ing the importance of professional interactions early in your training is critical to your future success as an emergency physician.

This research is the result of a survey completed by primary care and specialty consultants addressing the \"ideal\" relationship with consultants. The main con- clusion of this article is that specialty-dependent differences exist in consult pref- erences of physicians.CHAPTER 18 Patient Satisfaction\u2014 Meeting Patients'Expectations Much of the perception of what we do as health care providers is based on patient satisfaction and meeting patient expectations.Although most of the clinical and preclinical training we re- ceive as physicians revolves around developing the skills to provide ex- cellent patient care, little emphasis is placed on enhancing patientsatisfaction (people skills). For those of us who have had the roles re- versed, the frustrations encountered by patients can be better placed in context. Together with the taxing environment of a busy, slightly chaot-ic emergency department, you have a recipe for disaster unless you can remember that we are all in the customer service business. Often, the little things such as saying \"I am sorry that you have been waiting solong, but how can I help you?,\" \"I will be right with you,\" \"You look cold, can I get you a blanket?,\" can go a long way in comforting a pa- tient, developing rapport, and improving patient satisfaction. Patientswho are made comfortable and treated with respect are more often satis- fied with their care. What Do Patients Want? Patients want to be kept informed: They are more likely to be satisfied with their emergency department experience if kept informed about theircondition, plans for treatment, and any delays that they may encounter during their stay in the emergency department. Some patients also present to the emergency department with expectations of receiving a diagnos-tic test or a medication prescription. Others may fear the diagnosis of a serious health condition. Our role is also to comfort and educate our patients. By doing so, we can better meet their expectations. Patients want to be cared for in a timely manner: When presenting to the emergency department, many patients view their complaint as an emer- gency and therefore expect to be cared for in a timely manner. Not surpris-ingly, there is a strong correlation between dissatisfaction and excessive emergency department wait times. Interestingly, perceived wait times cor- relate more strongly with patient satisfaction than do actual wait times. Patients want to receive high-quality health care. It is not a surprise that patients expect to receive high-quality health care when they present to the emergency department. However, patients' and the physician's percep-tion of high-quality do not necessarily coincide. A patient's perception of high-quality is determined largely by the nature of his or her interpersonal interactions with the health care team, the adequacy of information pro-Patient Wish List \u0084Patients want to be kept in - formed. \u0084Patients want to be cared fo r in a timely manner. \u0084Patients want to receive high - quality health care.The perception of what we do as health care providers is based onpatient satisfaction and meetingpatient expectations.The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 63vided, and the resolution of symptoms. The emergency physician, howev- er, may judge quality differently, often focusing on ruling in or out serioushealth conditions, avoiding unnecessary diagnostic testing, and expedit- ing disposition rather than being able to make a definitive diagnosis or being able to alleviate all of the patient's presenting symptoms. Why Patient Satisfaction Matters First and foremost, patients deserve to be satisfied. No matter how youlook at what we do, we are in the patient satisfaction business. Patient satisfaction is increasingly being recognized as a key service goal by hos- pital administrators, patient advocacy groups, hospital accreditation or-ganizations, and, of course, patients. Satisfaction affects patient care: Between 5% and 10% of patients leave the emergency department without being seen by a physician or leaveAMA before their course of treatment is complete. Long wait times and perceived inadequacy of care are major contributors to patients' leaving the emergency department prematurely. These patients are at risk forpotentially serious adverse outcomes that might be avoided with greater attention paid to patient satisfaction. How Can I, As a Medical Student, Make a Difference? Medical students can play a significant role in enhancing patient satisfac- tion. At times, students are one of the first health care providers to beinvolved in the care of a patient. Because of this, they play an important role and can have a dramatic impact on patient satisfaction. Patients who report positive student-patient encounters regardless of the health caresetting (inpatient, ambulatory care, or emergency department) are more comfortable discussing personal health information and being examined by a medical student and anticipate greater benefit from future medicalstudent involvement than patients who reported having prior student en- counters that were not positive (Wald, 2007). In addition, most emergency department patients have positive perceptions of medical students, partic-ularly patients who have had prior medical student interaction. Provide Information to Patients Students generally have more free time than other members of the emer- gency department care team, and they are in a unique position to be able to spend time with their patients without compromising other duties.Students can greatly enhance patient satisfaction by keeping patients informed about their condition and plans for their care and by ensuring that they understand potential delays in their emergency departmentcourse. Obviously, students should not communicate information to pa- tients that they themselves do not fully understand. Students should not hesitate to say, \"I don't know, but I can find out,\" when confronted withdifficult questions. Discussing truly sensitive topics, delivering bad news, or informing a patient of unexpected test results are best left to more senior members of the health care team. Reduce Perceived Wait Times Students are generally not in a position to affect actual wait times or to have a dramatic effect on moving patients through the system. However, they may be able to lessen a patient's perception of long waiting times,particularly once the patient has been placed in a treatment room but has not yet been seen by the physician or if they are waiting for test results. They can do this by inquiring about and attending to their pa-tients' needs. Patients are likely to perceive wait times spent in physicalPatient satisfaction is increasingly being recognized as a key servicegoal by hospital administrators,patient advocacy groups, \u0083 Patient Satisfaction\u2014Meeting Patient's Expectationsdiscomfort or boredom as longer than they really are. Small gestures such as providing blankets for warmth, reading material or companionship,or something to eat (assuming the patient is not NPO) are likely to go a long way toward improving patient's comfort and shortening their per- ceived wait times. Be an Advocate for Your Patients Students often spend more time with their patients than other membersof the emergency department team and may be uniquely aware of their needs and concerns. Ironically, students often perceive their own role as superfluous and assume that everything they know about their patientsis known by the rest of the team. Nothing could be further from the truth, and students can play a key role in ensuring that their patients' needs are met. When patients have needs that they are unable to meetthemselves, students should make other members of the care team aware of those needs and work with the care team to meet them. This may mean asking the nurse to evaluate a suspected infiltrated IV catheter,asking the resident to order analgesia for a patient who is in pain, or asking the attending to help explain the implications of an abnormal test result. The important issue is that students advocate for their pa-tients while ensuring that their patients are comfortable, well informed, and well cared for by the emergency department team.

As you interview your patient, you will learn about his or her lifestyle habits, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, illicit substance use, medication compliance, and the like. You can have an active role in preventive care guidance. The following paragraphs cover a numberof topics that can be addressed at one time or another during your patient encounters in the emergency department. It is unlikely, and maybe even somewhat counterproductive because of time constraints, to addressevery one of these topics with each patient you encounter. Instead, it may be best to selectively approach each case in an individual fashion and provide anticipatory guidance to your patients on what youdetermine to be the most high-yield topics. Smoking Cessation Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States, accounting for more than 400,000 deaths annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006). Inthe primary care setting, screening and counseling have been shown to be effective methods of improving smoking cessation. Although less stud- ied in the emergency department, consider screening patients for tobac-co use and outpatient referral to their primary care physician for initiation of a smoking cessation program. Brief counseling or providing self-help literature may also be reasonable interventions in the emergency depart-ment. Alcohol Abuse Excessive alcohol use is the third leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States, resulting in an estimated 75,000 alcohol attributable deaths annually (Midanik et al., 2004). These patients are at risk of devel- oping chronic liver disease, hepatic carcinoma, and acute alcohol poi- soning. Excessive alcohol contributes significantly to unintentional injuries, including motor vehicle collisions, falls, drownings, and burns,as well as many intentional acts of violence. Consider screening emer- gency department patients for excess alcohol use and provide patient information for treatment as warranted. A simple-to-apply alcohol abusescreening tool is \"CAGE,\" which is shown in the accompanying box.Alcohol Abuse Screening Tool \"C\" - Have you ever felt that you should cut down on yourdrinking? \"A\" - Have people annoyed you by criticizing yourdrinking? \"G\" - Have you ever felt guilty about your drinking? \"E\" - Have you ever had a drink first thing in themorning to steady yournerves or get rid of ahangover (eye-opener)?Providing anticipatory guidance isan important part of in the emergencydepartment.66 \u0083 Providing Anticipatory GuidanceAnswering yes to any of these questions should lead you to suspect ex- cessive alcohol use and to pursue more detailed questioning. Fall Prevention in the Elderly Falls are the leading cause of injury-related death in elderly patientsand are the leading cause of injury related visits to the emergency department for patients over the age of 65 years (Fuller, 2000). Strat- egies to decrease falls include installing handrails on both sides of astairway, as well as grab bars next to the toilet, tub, and shower. Clutter and throw rugs in walkways should be removed, and nonslip mats should be placed in bathtubs and on shower floors. The entire homeof elderly patients should be well lit, and regular physical activity to build lower body strength and balance should be encouraged. When caring for an elderly patient in the emergency department, it may bereasonable to review fall prevention strategies. Traumatic Brain Injury Prevention More than 1.4 million people sustain a traumatic brain injury annu- ally in the United States, resulting in approximately 50,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations each year (National Centerfor Injury Prevention and Control, 2007). These injuries are caused by falls (28%), motor vehicle collisions (20%), objects (19%) and as- saults (11%; National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2007).Preventive steps against traumatic brain injury including using a seat- belt at all times when riding in a motor vehicle and placing children in child safety or booster seats until they are old enough for a seat-belt. Window guards protect children from falling out of open win- dows. Safety gates should be placed at the top and bottom of stairways if young children are in the home. Playground surfaces should bemade of shock-absorbent materials. Fall prevention techniques list- ed previously for the elderly also protect young children from head injury. Bicycle helmets are known to reduce the risk of bicycle-related head in- jury by 80%, but helmets are worn by only 15% of children and 19% of adults. Their use should be encouraged in children and adults when ridinga bicycle, motorcycle, snowmobile, scooter, or all-terrain vehicle. Hel- mets should also be used during horseback riding, skiing, snowboarding, inline skating, ice skating, skateboarding, baseball, and contact sportssuch as hockey or football. In selected circumstances, anticipatory guid- ance for strategies designed to reduce the incidence of traumatic brain injury can be provided to patients and their families in the emergencydepartment. Seatbelt and Pediatric Safety Seat Use In 2007, seatbelt use in the United States by all motorists was estimated to be at 82% (Glassbrenner and Ye, 2007). It has also been well estab- lished that the use of seatbelts saves lives, as evidenced by the vehicleoccupant fatality rate declining over the past 10 years as seatbelt use has steadily increased. Further, it is estimated that almost 60% of fatal- ities involving passenger cars and light trucks were unrestrained (Na-tional Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2002). The use of age- and size-appropriate restraint devices for children reduces serious and fatal injuries by more than half. More specifically, child safety seats re-duce the risk of fatal injuries by 71% for infants and by 54% for toddlers (Glassbrenner and Ye, 2005). Additional information regarding child safety seats can be found on the American Academy of Pediatrics Website (www.aap.org/family/carseatguide.htm) and the National HighwayThe Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 67Traffic Safety Administration Web site (www.nhtsa.dot.gov/portal/site/ nhtsa/menuitem.9f8c7d6359e0e9bbbf30811060008a0c/). Because re-straint use by children often parallels the driver's use, encourage par- ents to buckle up as well. Advocacy for the use of seatbelts and pediatric safety seats for our emergency department patients is imperative. Poisoning, Accidental Overdose, and Medication Noncompliance The overwhelming majority (84%) of poison exposures are unintention- al, with 51% of exposures occurring in children younger than 6 years (Watson et al., 2005). Even though most exposures are unintentional, the majority of poisoning fatalities in adolescents and adults were intention-al. However, the number of reported fatalities in children younger than 6 years (largely unintentional) has remained unchanged for the past two decades. Categories of substances with the largest number of reportedexposures include analgesics, cleaning products, cosmetics, sedatives, hyp- notics, and antipsychotics. The following categories of substances were associated with the largest numbers of fatalities: analgesics, sedatives, hyp-notics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, stimulants, and street drugs. Patients or their caregivers should be advised to keep medications and household chemical products in their original containers and to storethem in a childproof cabinet. They should carefully follow the directions on all medication and chemical product labels. Remind patients and their caregivers to avoid taking medication in front of children, to not callmedicine candy and, likewise, never store household chemicals in a food or beverage container. Poisonous house or yard plants should be removed from the home. All families should have the Poison Control Center num-ber readily available. This is another important issue to discuss with car- egivers who have small children living in the household. All too often, we find that patients do not take their medications or do not take them as prescribed. Antibiotics doses are commonly missed, whereas analgesics, particularly acetaminophen-containing products, are taken in excess or parents administering them to young children inad-vertently miscalculate doses. The unintentional excess administration of these with other medications can result in significant consequences. Many prescription and over-the-counter analgesics and other preparations con-tain acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Some patients unknowingly take mul- tiple medications with the same active ingredients. Gastrointestinal side effects or renal toxicity can be associated with excess ingestion of ibupro-fen, whereas hepatotoxicity can occur with excess administration of ace- taminophen-containing products. Medication noncompliance can occur for a number of reasons, includ- ing lack of adequate finances, intolerable side effects, misunderstanding, religious or cultural objections to certain prescribed therapies, or a false sense of omnipotence. It is important to try to understand the reasoningbehind patients' decision to forego medication so you are better able to address their specific concerns. Alternatively, some patients feel that the dose their physician prescribed is not relieving their symptoms, so theytake a stronger dose or take their medication more frequently than pre- scribed. Because of the reasons listed here, it may be reasonable to review your patients' medications with them to limit the likelihood of compli-cations related to excess or inappropriate medication administration. Drowning Drowning remains a leading cause of unintentional deaths in the United States and was responsible for more than 3,300 deaths in 2004. Many ofPoison Control Hotline 1-800-222-1222 This number will route th e call to a local poison cente r based on the area code and exchange of the caller. Th e number is functional 24hours a day in the 50 states , the District of Columbia, th e US Virgin Rico.68 \u0083 Providing Center, 2007a). A number of risk factors for drowning and submersion injuries have beenidentified: lack of supervision and barriers such as pool fencing, recre- ation activities in natural water settings, recreational boating, alcohol use, and patients with seizure disorders. In children ages 1 to 4 years old, most drowning occurs in a swimming pool, and the majority of these children were out of their parents' sight for less than 5 minutes. For those with a seizure disorder, drowning mostcommonly occurs in the bathtub. Strategies for drowning prevention include parental vigilance, safety latches on bathroom doors to prevent infant or toddler entry, safety fencing around household pools, and show-ering as the preferred method of cleansing for those with a seizure disor- der. Anticipatory guidance for preventing water-related injuries may be more applicable to the summer months and to patients living in warmerclimate areas. Smoke Detectors Four out of five fire-related deaths occur in the home, and approxi- mately half of home fire deaths occur in homes without smoke de- tectors. Most fire victims die from smoke or toxic gas inhalation,rather than from the burns (Injury Center, 2007b). Those at greatest risk of fire-related death and injury include children younger than 5 years, the elderly, and those who live in rural areas or substandardhousing (Injury Center, 2007b). Preventive measures include install- ing and maintaining smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors on every floor of the home. Flammable objects, including loose fit-ting clothing, should not be near the stove or space heater. Matches and lighters should be kept out of the reach of children. Smoking in bed should be prohibited, and lit cigarettes or candles should not beleft unattended. In addition, unattended cooking is a leading cause of scald burns in young children and residential fires. A family fire escape plan, including a designated outdoor meeting site, should bein place and practiced biannually. Childproofing the Home In addition to the preventive measures listed previously, electric socket plugs lessen the risk of electrocution injury. In addition, it is advisable that small toy pieces, balloons, button batteries, and a variety of small orsharp household objects be kept out of a small child's reach. Hot water heaters should be adjusted so that the temperature does not exceed 120\u00b0F. By doing so, you can dramatically decrease the likelihood of causing adeep partial thickness or full thickness scald burn. Hypertension Blood pressure evaluation is the most common screening test performed in the emergency department. It has been estimated that more than 50 million Americans (1 in 4 adults) have high blood pressure warrantingsome form of treatment (Hajjar and Kotchen, 2003). Of these hyperten- sive patients, almost 30% were unaware of their illness, and 42% were not being treated (Hajjar and Kotchen, 2003). In the emergency depart-ment, elevated blood pressure readings roughly approximate that of the general ambulatory population. Uncontrolled hypertension is a risk fac- tor for the development of cardiovascular disease. The relationship be-tween blood pressure and cardiovascular disease is consistent, continuous, and independent of all other risk factors. For patients discharged from the emergency department who have elevated blood pressure readings,The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 69it is advisable that they follow up with their primary care provider, as outlined in the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (National High Blood Pressure Education Program, 2004).

Graduating medical students have a wide variety of procedural skill experience. A number of medical students complete their core third-year clerkships without performing veni- puncture, peripheral IV access, urethral catheterization, or ABG sampling. Your emergency medicine clerkship may help alleviate some of these is- sues by providing you with exposure to a wide variety of procedures thatmay not be as readily encountered on other clinical rotations. You should take advantage of this opportunity and perform as many procedures as possible to build confidence in your skills before graduation. Although your clinical experience will vary day to day and between clinical training sites, ample opportunities often exist to perform proce- dures throughout your emergency medicine clerkship. The proceduresmost commonly performed by students are peripheral IV access and phlebotomy. Even though many medical schools do not have a formal process to ensure that a student is competent or proficient in perform-ing these skills, they are nonetheless very important. Many students, interns, and residents will be called on to perform these basic yet neces- sary skills. Regarding procedural instruction, it is equally important tounderstand which patients truly need IV access and the various options available for crystalloid fluid administration (e.g., normal saline, half- normal saline, D 5 normal saline). Students should also gain experience in procedurally related tasks such as connecting IV fluid tubing, trou- bleshooting a clogged IV, maintaining proper technique for collecting blood cultures, and determining which color blood tubes are required Categories of Procedural Opportunities in the Emergency Department for Medical Students \u0084Procedures typically performed independently with direct supervision: IV access, phlebotomy, insertion, ABG sampling, urethral catheterization, simple laceration repair \u0084Procedures typically performed in an assist role, but sometimes playing an independent role: arthrocen- tesis, central venous access, incision and in-sertionAmple perform procedures throughoutyour emergency medicine clerkship.72 \u0083 Procedural Skillsfor specific chemistry or hematology testing. The same can be said for other procedures that are performed by students and house staff: NGTinsertion, ABG sampling, urethral catheterization, and laceration repair, to name a few. It is important to remember that the psychomotor skill involved with performing many procedures improves with repetition.However, it is essential that you become familiar with the indications and contraindications for performing specific procedures. Procedural opportunities in the emergency department can often be categorized into one of three different groups. The first group in- cludes procedures you will likely perform independently with direct supervision: IV access, phlebotomy, NGT insertion, ABG sampling,urethral catheterization, simple laceration repair, and the like. The next group includes those procedures that you will likely assist with, but at times may have more of an independent role: arthrocentesis,central venous access, incision and drainage of a cutaneous abscess, and lumbar puncture. The final category includes those procedures that because of the complexity and urgency of the situation, you willlikely observe: orotracheal intubation, tube thoracostomy, and trans- venous pacemaker insertion. Your direct participation in performing or assisting with any procedure is always up to the discretion of theattending physician. This decision is often based on a number of factors, including the student's experience with performing the pro- cedure, the complexity of the procedure, the comfort level of thepatient, and the inherent risk to the patient. That being said, it is still likely that you will have the opportunity to be involved. How Can I Become More Comfortable in Performing Procedures? One of the first steps in becoming more comfortable is to familiarize yourself with the procedure(s) that you would like to learn to perform. These can be procedures that you have a high likelihood of performing,or they can be selected procedures that are uncommon or that you are less familiar with. Couple this choice with your career interests, and you have a good place to start. You can easily take advantage of the wealth ofinformation available to you in hardcopy textbooks or on the Internet. Three excellent resources are as follows: \u0084Roberts and Hedges, Clinical Procedures in Emergency Medicine , 2004 \u0084Rosen and Chan, Atlas of Emergency Procedures , 2002 \u0084Custalow, Color Atlas of Emergency Department Procedures , 2004 The Roberts and Hedges text is available in full-text version through MD Consult for which some medical schools have institutional sub- scriptions. The New England Journal of Medicine publishes an online se- ries titled \"Videos in Clinical Medicine\" (http://content.nejm.org/misc/Procedural Skills WProcedural San Francisco General Hospital, emergency medicine residency Web site www.emresidency.ucsf.edu/ (under resources, select \"educational material\") \u0084University of Maryland, emergency medicine residency Web site www.umem.org/res_student.phpThe Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 73videos.shtml?ssource=recentVideos). These procedural videos highlight a number of common and advanced procedural skills and are accompa-nied by a summary PDF article further reviewing the topic. McGraw- Hill's \"Access Emergency Medicine\" is another Web-based resource that contains a broad range of emergency cases with accompanying proce-dural videos (www.accessem.com/public/about_aem.aspx). Elsevier also offers an online educational resource titled \"Procedural Consults.\" This resource reviews a number of basic and advanced procedures(http://app.proceduresconsult.com/Learner/Default.aspx). A number of these online resources require individual or institutional subscriptions to fully access the educational material. The University of CaliforniaSan Francisco/San Francisco General Hospital emergency medicine res- idency Web site contains a number of educational procedural videos (www.emresideny.ucsf.edu). Additional advanced procedural videos canalso be found on the University of Maryland emergency medicine resi- dency Web site under the section of procedural videos (www.umem.org/ res_student.php). Remember, each student will have a different procedural experience throughout his or her emergency medicine clerkship. This is in part because of the variety and complexity of patients encountered and,to some extent, the interest or proactiveness of the student. It may be more important for some students, based on career aspirations, to partake in certain procedures.

It is also reasonable to supplement your core reading with recently published journal articles. Here are a few suggestions to help focus yourapproach to reading during your emergency medicine clerkship: Keep track of your patient encounters. Set aside 20 to 30 minutes each day (a somewhat realistic goal) and try to read about one of the inter- esting cases that you addressed that day. \u007f Pick one or more emergency medicine topics that you are interested in but not very familiar with. By researching the topic(s), you willdevelop additional knowledge about a particular subject. \u007f Focus some of your reading on common emergency department com- plaints (e.g., abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath). Addi-tional reading in these areas will help to broaden your general fund ofknowledge. A number of excellent educational resources are available to studentscompleting an emergency medicine clerkship. These can be found invarious forms, ranging from classic hardcopy textbooks to state-of-the- art online resources. Here we have attempted to identify some key educa- tional resources that will help you learn more about the clinical practiceof emergency medicine. Some of these online resources are free, whereas others require individual or institutional subscriptions to fully access the educational material.

Active learning often requires more upfront effort from the learner but, in return, the teaching can be- come more individualized. Several ways to engage in active learningthat will enhance your rotation experience include the following: prepare before your rotation, solicit feedback, set your own goals, verbalize an assessment and management plan, prepare follow-upcards, maintain a \"peripheral brain,\" develop a question log, have a positive attitude, and exhibit professionalism. Prepare Before Your Rotation Before your rotation starts, spend a few weeks reading about common chief complaints encountered in the emergency department. These topicsare covered in various emergency medicine textbooks and numerous educational Web sites. By spending time reviewing these topics, you can build on your fund of medical knowledge from Day 1 of your rota-tion. Common chief complaints you will encounter in the emergency department are shown in the box on this page. Solicit Feedback Solicit Feedback From Your Supervisors Receiving feedback about your clinical performance is crucial for medi- cal students to reinforce behaviors or skills performed well or to high- light areas that could benefit from improvement. Feel welcome to solicitfeedback on your performance from your supervisors. This can be done at the conclusion of a case presentation, after a patient encounter, or at the end of a clinical shift. When actively soliciting feedback, ask focused questions (see the box on the next page). Focused questions make it easier for the supervisor to give you concrete feedback on a particular skill or action. Solicit Feedback From a Nurse Nurses are an integral part of the emergency department team. Solicitingfeedback from the nurses serves two functions. First, it demonstrates that you value their opinion. Second, nurses often can provide valuable in- Common Complaint s in the Emergency Department \u0084Abdominal pain \u0084Altered mental status \u0084Back pain \u0084Chest pain \u0084Fever \u0084Headache \u0084Musculoskeletal injury, trauma, and care \u0084Nausea and vomiting \u0084Shortness of breath \u0084Sore throatActive learning often requires more upfront effort from the learner, butin return, the teaching can becomemore individualized.The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 81sight into your patient and staff communication skills, order writing, and basic procedural skills such as phlebotomy. Set Your Own Goals Throughout your rotation, you will be supervised by a number of differ- ent faculty members and residents. This is often the case because of the shift work scheduling that is inherent to our specialty. As a result, youwill experience less continuity with your teachers compared with other clinical rotations. When you work with a new preceptor, it can be help- ful to let them know about your career interests and individual goals thatyou have set for yourself for the rotation. This will help your supervisor focus his or her teaching and possibly direct certain cases or procedural opportunities your way to further enhance your experience. Individualgoals might include the following: 1. Procedures (e.g., suturing skills, ABG sampling, or bedside ultrasonog- raphy) 2. Examination skills (e.g., cardiac, neurologic, or musculoskeletal) 3. General approach to a type of patient (trauma, septic, or seizure) 4. Chart documentation5. Interpretation skills (e.g., reading orthopedic plain films or ECGs) 6. Presentation skills (e.g., to supervisor or consultants or at rounds) Verbalize an Assessment and Management Plan One trait that often sets stellar students apart from others is the ability to formulate and verbalize an assessment and management plan whenpresenting a case to their preceptor. When presenting a case, many stu- dents can verbalize their H&PE findings. However, many students will pause after presenting the subjective and objective portions of a case asif expecting feedback, reassurance, or validation. Instead, verbalize what you think is going on with your patient, the differential diagnosis (from emergent to least emergent, sharing the likelihood of each), and yourproposed management plan. Rather than functioning as just a \"report- er\" of information, at this stage in your training, you should be func- tioning as an \"interpreter\" of the data and a \"manager\" of the patient.By providing your differential diagnosis, assessment, and plan, you will be giving your supervisor greater insight into your knowledge base and thought process. Prepare Follow-up Cards The lack of follow-up of emergency department patients is a perceivednegative aspect of emergency medicine that some medical students cite in their career decisionmaking process. To continually learn and improve, students should maintain index cards of interesting patients who areSuggestions for Soliciting Feedback \u0084Having seen a few of my notes, what could I do to improve my documentation? \u0084Do you have any suggestions how I can better focus my case presentations? \u0084How do you think I can improve my procedural skills? \u0084I would like to get better at reading ECGs, do you have any suggestions? Feel welcome to solicit feedback on your performance from your super-visors. This can be done at the con-clusion of a case presentation, aftera patient encounter, or at the endof a clinical shift.82 \u0083 How to Get the Most Out of Your Emergency Medicine Clerkshipadmitted to the hospital or discharged home. Checking hospital records or talking with the admitting team a few days later can lead to invaluablelearning experiences. You can also talk with your supervisor about call- ing a patient who was discharged home to see how he or she is doing. Obtaining follow-up should be a long-term means to engage in activelearning, not only during medical school but also during residency train- ing and beyond. An added benefit of obtaining follow-up of admitted patients is that the student can now inform the supervisor of the inter-esting outcomes or diagnoses. This demonstrates to the supervisor that you are actively trying to learn outside of your time in the emergency department and are engaging in practice-based learning. Maintain a \"Peripheral Brain\" There are many pearls of wisdom to be learned during your emergencymedicine clerkship. Writing these down on index cards or inputting them into a PDA can further solidify information retention. During your emer- gency medicine clerkship, add relevant bedside teaching points, lectureconcepts, and publication data. This may include high-yield items such as indications for thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction or stroke, the pneumonia severity index scoring system from the PORTstudy, and NEXUS criteria for clinical clearance of the cervical spine. This \"peripheral brain\" should be continually updated throughout medical school, residency, and postresidency. Develop a Question Log During each shift, generate a list of questions to research some timeduring the rotation. Questions can be based on any aspect of patient care and can include reviewing medication information, managing a case, developing a differential diagnosis, formulating a diagnostic work-up for a particular presentation, or reviewing a procedural technique. Research the literature and read more about your patient's disease pro- cess when you get home. While on shift, as a self-reminder, you can e-mail yourself this list of \"homework\" questions. Reading about clinically relevant topics that you have encountered helps build your knowledge base. Have a Positive Attitude The emergency department team thrives on working cohesively as a groupand is, as a whole, an enthusiastic and high-energy team. Instructors are more amenable to teaching students if they demonstrate an enthusiasm for learning, want to be in the emergency department, and are open tofeedback. Exhibit Professionalism This is your time to shine in the eyes of the faculty. Arrive early, work hard, and stay late. You do not want to be thought of as the student who just wants to get the shift over with. Do not spend your time surf-ing the Internet. You are in the emergency department to learn. Stay on top of your patients. When something happens with one of your pa- tients, you should be the first one to know about it. If a lab result is notback in a timely fashion, call the lab to see if it has received the speci- men. Dress appropriately for the emergency department: scrubs or pro- fessional attire (no tee shirts, sweatshirts, or blue jeans). Make sure yourpatients are well cared for at all times. Remember, you are your pa- tient's student doctor.How to Be an Active Learner \u0084Solicit feedback. \u0084Set goals. \u0084Verbalize an assessment and management plan. \u0084Prepare follow-up cards. \u0084Maintain a peripheral brain. \u0084Develop a question log. \u0084Have a positive attitude. \u0084Exhibit professionalism.The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 83Students Applying to Emergency Medicine Residency Training Programs One last tip for maximizing your emergency medicine clerkship applies primarily to those applying for an emergency medicine residency posi- tion. Because students rarely work consistently with the same faculty member, letters of recommendation for residency applications may bedifficult to obtain. Often, clerkship directors will write a composite let- ter, summarizing the comments from various faculty members who have worked with you. If, however, you are going to request a letter from asingle faculty member, it is important that you let the faculty member on shift know that you are applying to emergency medicine so he or she will pay special attention to your skills and knowledge base. It is no se-cret that you will eventually be asking for a letter of recommendation from the department, and the evaluators will want to have something specific to write about. If possible, with permission, consider modifyingyour clinical schedule to work multiple shifts with the same faculty mem- ber. By doing so, faculty members will have the opportunity to work with you on several shifts and will be able to provide a more detailedletter of recommendation. This may or may not be possible and is often based on the number of students working clinically in the emergency department during a particular rotation. Summary Getting the most out of your emergency medicine clerkship revolvesaround maintaining a positive attitude, working diligently, and taking an ongoing and active role in learning. Applying this philosophy will serve you well during medical school, in residency training, and beyond. Suggested Reading Mahadevan SV , Garmel GM. The outstanding gency medicine.

These six competencies were endorsed by the ACGME in February 1999. Thesix core competencies are as follows: \u0084Patient care \u0084Medical knowledge \u0084Professionalism \u0084Systems-based practice \u0084Practice-based learning and improvement \u0084Interpersonal and communication skills As of 2002, all graduate medical education training programs accredited by the ACGME are responsible for requirements related to the compe-tencies. In the past, residency training emphasized structure and process components. This emphasis will become less critical over time as more emphasis is placed on outcome measures. Graduate medical educationtraining programs are now expected to show evidence of how they use educational outcomes to improve individual resident and overall pro- gram performance. Currently, we are in Phase 3 of the Outcomes Project(July 2006-June 2011). This phase includes full integration of the com- petencies and their assessment with learning and clinical care. The final phase (July 2011 and beyond) includes expansion of the competenciesto include models of excellence. [More details about the ACGME Out- comes Project are available at www.acgme.org/outcome/. The most re- cent version (2007) of the program requirements for graduate medicaleducation in emergency medicine can be found at www.acgme.org/ acWebsite/downloads/RRC_progReq/110emergencymed07012007.pdf.] The recently published National Fourth Year Medical Student Emergency Med- icine Curriculum Guide emphasizes the use of these six core competencies as a framework for the learning objectives of an undergraduate emergen- cy medicine curriculum. These competencies were selected for two rea-sons. First, they clearly outline the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that should be instilled in a physician in training. Second, they allow the evaluation of students and residents to be consistent and uniform andease the transition between medical school and residency. This sectionGraduate medical education train- ing programs are now expected toshow evidence of how they use edu-cational outcomes to improve indi-vidual resident and overall programperformance. Patient care as defined by ACGME should be \"timely, effective, appro-priate, and compassionate for themanagement of health problemsand the promotion of health.\"The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 85of the Primer will review each of the six core competencies and highlight those that pertain to the undergraduate curriculum. An in-depth reviewof each of the six competencies as they relate to the specialty of emer- gency medicine, specifically residency training, can be found in the jour- nal Academic Emergency Medicine (Acad Emerg Med. 2002;9:1211-1277). Many aspects of the core competencies can be applied at the medical student level, especially during a fourth-year clerkship. Patient Care Patient care as defined by ACGME should be \"timely, effective, appropri- ate, and compassionate for the management of health problems and thepromotion of health.\" To do this, the student must be able to obtain an accurate history and perform a physical examination concisely focused on the patient's complaint. In the emergency department, the studentshould be able to identify correctly and immediately any life-threatening illnesses. Patient management skills should include the ability to devel- op an appropriate evaluation and treatment plan. The student shouldmonitor the patient for response to the outlined therapy and alter this therapy as indicated. The student should also follow through on patient care to include proper disposition and follow-up care when the patient isdischarged from the emergency department. Within the confines of procedural competence, students should be able to list the indications and contraindications of basic procedures theymay perform in the emergency department. The basic procedures listed in the National Curriculum include ECG procurement and interpreta- tion, Foley catheter placement, interpretation of cardiac monitoring, NGTinsertion, peripheral IV access, pulse oximeter reading, splint applica- tion, wound closure, and venipuncture. Under the auspices of health promotion, the student should discuss any preventable illness or injury as the case presents itself in the evaluation of a patient. This would include items such as smoking cessation, seat- belt and helmet use, and medication compliance. Many of these topicsare addressed in detail in the Primer section on anticipatory guidance. The student should educate the patients to the extent that they can un- derstand and assist in implementation of their outpatient care plans. Stu-dents should also ensure that patients understand their discharge instructions, can arrange for follow-up care, can afford as well as com- prehend how to use medications, and understand when to return forfurther evaluation. Other aspects of the patient care core competency as defined by the ACGME that were not abstracted into the medical student curriculuminclude making informed decisions about diagnostic and therapeutic interventions based on patient information and preferences, up-to-date scientific evidence, and clinical judgment. Although mastery may bebeyond the scope of experience and knowledge of the student, it certain- ly should be taught by the instructor and is a critical skill to begin devel- oping. The use of information technology to support patient care decisionsand patient education is particularly important and will become an in- creasingly important part of patient care as the student progresses through residency training and beyond. Any opportunity for the student to useavailable educational resources to make an informed decision about di- agnostic studies or therapeutic intervention is an opportunity to develop and refine this skill and certainly is to be encouraged. Although residentsare expected to perform competently all medical and invasive procedures considered essential for the area of practice, students often have limited procedural opportunities before their emergency medicine rotation. Theemergency medicine rotation, however, is likely your best opportunityAs defined by the ACGME, medical knowledge relates to the ability todemonstrate \"an investigatory andanalytic thinking approach to clin-ical situations, to know and applythe basic and clinically supportivesciences which are appropriate totheir discipline.\"86 \u0083 An Introduction to the Core Competenciesto learn procedural skills. Use this educational opportunity to your ad- vantage. A final aspect of this core competency as defined by the ACGME in- cludes the ability \"to work with health care professionals, including those from other disciplines, to provide patient-focused care.\" This aspect ofpatient care is interwoven with professionalism and interpersonal and communication skills. Medical Knowledge As defined by the ACGME, medical knowledge relates to the ability to demonstrate \"an investigatory and analytic thinking approach to clini-cal situations, to know and apply the basic and clinically supportive sci- ences which are appropriate to their discipline.\" The National Curriculum aimed to more clearly define these expectations as they relate to medicalstudents. The competency of medical knowledge extends far beyond one's fund of factual knowledge. Students are expected to develop the skills necessary to evaluate an un- differentiated patient under a realm of chief complaints that include ab- dominal or pelvic pain, alteration or loss of consciousness, chest pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, headache, shock, shortness of breath, vaginalbleeding, eye pain or vision changes, overdose, weakness and dizziness, and traumatic complaints. Students are expected to develop a list of dif- ferential diagnoses, based on the patient's presentation, which is priori-tized not just by likelihood but by potential severity as it relates to morbidity and mortality. In evaluating patients, a student should learn the indications, contrain- dications, and proper interpretations of the results of common diagnos- tic procedures and tests. Most importantly, students should cultivate an appreciation of pretest probabilities and risk. More important than anytest result is the insight you need to develop throughout your career of when to trust, and when not to trust, that result. Further adapting the definition of the medical knowledge core compe- tency for our specialty includes the immediate recall of selected informa- tion for the care of critical patients, an understanding of the use of medical resources for the immediate care of the patient, and the ability to applythis information to undifferentiated patient presentations. The traditional definitions used for competencies such as medical knowledge cross the boundaries of the other competencies. Medical knowledge in emergencymedicine includes the acquisition of information from the patient (com- munication and interpersonal skills) and the application or delivery of the care (patient care). Practice-Based Learning and Improvement Practice-based learning and improvement is defined by the ACGME as\"the ability to investigate and evaluate their patient care practices, ap- praise and assimilate scientific evidence, and improve patient care.\" Practice-based learning can be learned through the systematically eval-uating patient care and population features; teaching other students and health care professionals; and applying knowledge gained from a systematic evaluation of the medical literature, including study designand statistical methodology. Continuous Quality Improvement As a student, you may not be aware of, or have access to, the continuous quality improvement (CQI) process that all hospital departments havePractice-based learning and im- provement is defined by the ACGMEas \"the ability to investigate andevaluate their patient care practic-es, appraise and assimilate scientificevidence, and improve patient care.\"The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 87in place. The CQI process is one venue in which patient care, depart- ment process issues, and other sensitive information are communicatedin a legally protected environment. If there are any questions or con- cerns about the care a physician or resident has provided, it is openly discussed and the documentation is reviewed for standard of care, sys-tems issues, or documentation factors that may have contributed to an error or adverse outcome. Reviewed events are examined on several lev- els (systematic methodology) based on outcome, physician care, physi-cian documentation, and resident supervision. The physicians involved are notified of the outcome and of suggestions for improvement. Oppor- tunities to improve hospital and departmental practices are likewise iden-tified and implemented. Journal Club Throughout medical school, students are exposed to journal club or a similar activity in which original research from the medical literature is critically appraised, often to answer a clinical question. Before gradua-tion, medical students should be introduced to the concept of reviewing the medical literature. This useful skill will be further reinforced during residency training. By understanding research methodology, you will beable to incorporate scientifically based principles into current practice, that is, evidence-based medicine. Life-Long Self-Assessment and Continuous Osteopathic Learning Assessment The Life-Long Self-Assessment (LLSA) and the Continuous Osteopathic Learning Assessment (COLA) are now being required for maintenance of emergency medicine board certification as a way to ensure that practic-ing emergency physicians keep current on recent literature. The annual LLSA and COLA examination covers articles or readings that have been chosen by a panel formed by the ABEM and the AOBEM, respectively. The ACGME expects postgraduate trainees to use information technolo- gy to manage information, access online medical information, and be able to support self-directed learning. Many teaching institutions havesoftware and other educational materials that may be used for your own or patient education. Online resources such as Up to Date or MD Consult and many others are available and can prove useful in bedside teachingand learning. Teaching other health care professionals is an effective way to learn and represents an important contribution that you can make toward improv-ing patient care. This can be as simple as teaching nurses, technicians, or more junior students disease pathophysiology at the bedside or explain- Systems-Based Decisionmaking Consider a patient who requires a CT scan of the abdomen with oral and IV contrast. After the decision ha s been made to obtain this study, the patient needs to have a peripheral IV placed to administer IV contrast . What if this is difficult, and he or she requires multiple attempts? This takes time and nursing resources . The patient will often be required to have a basic metabolic profile performed to evaluate his or her rena l function and of course drink oral contrast. Considering these steps, it may take 4 to 5 or more hours from the time that the study is ordered until the CT is officially interpreted by an attending radiologist. Addingto this time can be the unexpected emergencies and delays that can occur with transport, obtaininglaboratory results, or other sick or injured patients requiring advanced imaging. Some hospital emergenc y departments may have access to only one CT scanner. Therefore, decisions will have to be made regardingresource utilization, allowing the more urgent patients to be imaged sooner than the less urgent patients .As defined by the ACGME, systems-based practice is the \"demonstrableawareness of and responsiveness tothe larger content and system ofhealth care and the ability toeffectively call on system resourcesto provide care that is of optimalvalue.\"88 \u0083 An Introduction to the Core Competenciesing the underlying rationale for your patient orders. More formal oppor- tunities to teach may be available within your own institution. External formal courses to consider taking are advanced trauma life support, ad- vanced cardiac life support, and pediatric advanced life support. Practice-based learning and improvement is a career-long responsibility by which you remain current with all aspects of patient care. Practicing evidence-based medicine demonstrates your commitment to continual-ly providing the best care for your patients. Systems-Based Practice As defined by the ACGME, systems-based practice is the \"demonstrable awareness of and responsiveness to the larger content and system of health care and the ability to effectively call on system resources to provide carethat is of optimal value.\" It therefore extends beyond the individual pa- tient's bedside to include an understanding of how your practice is af- fected by other practitioners, patients, and society at large, whileconsidering the cost of health care and the allocation of health care re- sources. Understanding the \"system\" also involves learning how types of practices and health care delivery systems vary from one another, waysto advocate for patient care and assist patients in dealing with system complexities, and how to partner with healthcare managers and health care providers to assess, coordinate, and improve healthcare. Finally, com-petence with systems-based practice requires that you recognize how your actions and the system relate to each other. A system is defined as interrelated components comprising a unified whole. Systems thinking is a technique for seeing and understanding interrelationships and the processes and barriers to change. The out- come desired for our medical practice\u2014our unified mission\u2014is to pro-vide high-quality patient care. Access to routine health care is also a systems-based concern. It was esti- mated in 2004 that about 47 million Americans (16%) were without healthinsurance, a figure that continues to rise annually (Facts of Health Insur- ance Coverage, 2008). African Americans and Hispanics represent a dis- proportionate percentage of uninsured patients in this country. Inaddition, patients older than 65 and ethnic minorities use the emergen- cy department for health care services at a rate much greater than that of the general population. Further, more than 19 million emergency de-partment visits annually are by patients without health insurance (Nawar, 2007). Lastly, approximately 20% of the uninsured population reports that their usual source of health care is the emergency department (Factsof Health Insurance Coverage, 2008). In the 1990s as a way to promote a more efficient and cost-effective provision of health care, health maintenance organizations (HMOs) at-tempted to restrict the use of the emergency department for nonurgent patient complaints. At that time, various HMOs required a hospital emergency department to contact them to authorize reimbursementfor the provision of emergency care. This resulted in significant con- sumer dissatisfaction. In recent years, the preauthorization requirements for patients requiring emergency medical services have been waived. A systems-based approach to a patient's health care may begin at home with the use of emergency medical services to transport a patient to a local emergency department. This extends through the clinical workupand management in the emergency department, possible hospitalization, follow-up care, and beyond. For many patient encounters, a decision has to be made regarding what, if any, diagnostic studies need to be per-formed. This appears to be a simple-enough task, but even this decisionA system is defined as interrelated components comprising a unifiedwhole. Systems thinking is a tech-nique for seeing and understand-ing interrelationships and theprocesses and barriers to change.The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 89has ramifications. Does the test need to performed at 1:00 AM, or can the patient have the test performed the following morning or electively afterdischarge from the emergency department? Some diagnostic imaging stud- ies (MRI, certain ultrasounds, or vascular studies) require a technician to come to the hospital from home during off hours. Other tests may takehours to complete. Remember, an ultrasound of the abdomen or a CT scan of the brain costs money, and a patient or his or her insurance com- pany is billed an extraordinary fee for these services. A hospital has touse laboratory technicians, phlebotomists, x-ray and CT technicians, trans- porters, nurses, and the like, all representing a cost to the overall health care system. In the larger picture, the overutilization or indiscriminateuse of limited health care resources continues to drive up the cost of medical care. This is just one facet of what we as emergency physicians deal with when looking at the overall picture of a systems-based practice. Some patients may require the assistance of a social worker or case man- ager. At some institutions, these resources are limited. This service is in- valuable and may make the difference between a hospital admission orbeing able to safely discharge a patient home. Different system-related issues also arise for the patient that you plan to discharge home. At times, this may be because of the availability of follow-up health care, access toa specialist, ability to care for oneself, or the ability to pay for a new medication. Does the patient have access to follow-up heath care? Can the patient pay for his or her medication prescription? If the patient willbe discharged before all test results are available (e.g., urine culture, for- mal radiograph interpretation), does your emergency department have a system in place to ensure that the final results or radiograph interpreta-tion discrepancy will be reported to the patient in a timely fashion? What if you were caring for a patient who could not recall important de- tails of his or her past medical history? The retrieval of old medical recordscan be helpful for understanding pertinent aspects of the patient's past medical history, medications, allergies, prior diagnostic test results, and the like. What mechanism is in place for the emergency physician or stu-dent to obtain this information? Some hospitals have an electronic medi- cal record that makes all of this information easily available, whereas other hospitals may still rely on a paper system, which creates many difficultieswhen old records are urgently needed. Although an electronic medical record or other computer-based information retrieval system can allow easy access to the medical record, prior test results, and more, it is a costly un-dertaking and requires a strong commitment from the hospital adminis- tration to provide the resources to develop the infrastructure. Not many years ago, to access old medical records in some institutions, a student orphysician would have to go to the medical records department and read through a handwritten copy of the chart. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) is a federal statute enacted in 1986 and can be viewed as a nondiscriminato- ry statute. The basis for this legislation was to ensure that a patient pre- senting to an emergency department be provided with \"an appropriatemedical screening examination\" to determine whether he or she is suf- fering from an \"emergency medical condition\" regardless of his or her ability to pay for medical care. The statute also governs a number ofother issues that directly affect the practice of emergency medicine, in- cluding patient transfers and on-call physicians. Additional information on this topic can be found in Naradzay (2008). Remember, systems-based practice involves CQI. This can be intradepart- mental (morbidity and mortality conferences) or interdepartmental (hos- pitalwide peer review or performance improvement committees). Keepin mind that we are all part of one large system.More than 19 million emergency department visits annually are bypatients without health insurance. . . approximately 20% of theuninsured population reports thattheir usual source of health care isthe emergency department.90 \u0083 An Introduction to the Core CompetenciesProfessionalism ACGME defines professionalism as the following: \"consistently dem- onstrate respect and compassion to others, manage conflict, and behavein a manner consistent with their values.\" Professionalism should be viewed as an academic virtue, not just an expected set of behaviors. How- ever, professionalism is often less tangible and more difficult to evaluatethan factual knowledge. Unprofessional behavior can run the gamut of behaviors, including substance abuse, lying, cheating, unexcused absenc- es, or falsifying medical records. Unprofessional behavior in medicalschool is associated with future subsequent disciplinary action by a state medical board. Professionalism involves the knowledge and ability to act in an ethical fashion, including the ability to be sensitive to patients regardless of cul- ture, age, or gender. Students exhibit professionalism through their mo- tivation, integrity, honesty, and reliability. Furthermore, a student shouldinteract appropriately with other members of the health care team and show respect for the people they encounter during shifts, including staff, peers, patients, and patients' families. Professionalism is also demonstra-ble in clinical management decisions, especially the ethical principles pertaining to the provision of withholding of clinical care, confidential- ity of patient information, and informed consent. Regarding medicalprofessionalism, students should be held to the same standards as physi- cians. They should demonstrate a responsiveness to the needs of patients and society that supersedes self-interest; be accountable to patients, soci-ety, and the profession; and demonstrate a commitment to excellence and ongoing professional development. Typically, professionalism is observed in the clinical setting as well as the classroom. Adhering to an acceptable dress code and arriving on time for shifts are also within the realm of professionalism. These virtues are un- der constant observation by our colleagues, hospital administrators, staff,and of course patients and their families. Professional behavior is an ex- pectation for all of us (students, residents, and attendings). As a medical student in the emergency department, your professionalism will be eval-uated by your supervising resident or attending physician. As you enter residency training, it is likely that your professional behavior and virtues will be evaluated on multiple levels. Within the ACGME toolbox of as-sessment methods, a \"360-degree evaluation instrument\" can be used to assess professional behaviors as well as other competencies; 360-degree evaluations consists of measurement tools that can be completed by peers,subordinates, patients, and their families [ACGME Outcomes Project and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), 2000]. Interpersonal and Communication Skills The ACGME defines interpersonal and communication skills as \"the ability to communicate with colleagues, staff, and family and to employ effec- tive interpersonal skills that revolve around the care of a patient.\" These skills go far beyond the ability to interview a patient and obtain an ade-quate history and are vital to the development of a competent, caring physician. Students must be able to demonstrate interpersonal and com- munication skills that result in effective information exchange and in-teraction with patients, families, and staff. This skill will become increasingly important when dealing with issues such as obtaining in- formed consent, delivering bad news, and resolving conflicts. The publichas an expectation that a physician should be able to communicate in a caring and compassionate manner.The ACGME defines professional- ism as the following: \"consistently demonstrate respect and compas-sion to others, manage conflict,and behave in a manner consistentwith their values.\"The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 91Interpersonal and communication skills encompass the effective es- tablishment of a relationship with a patient and the ability to com-municate with others on the health care team to deliver sound medical care. Students must also use effective listening skills and elicit and provide information using nonverbal, explanatory, questioning, andwriting skills\u2014each of which is crucial to your ability to work effec- tively with others as a member of the health care team. In addition, each of us needs to be aware of the image that we project and howwe are perceived by others. As emergency physicians, we pride ourselves on our interpersonal and communication skills. Every day we interact with patients and familiesin pain and stressful situations. We have to develop rapport with our patients when they are most vulnerable, and at times we have to deliver bad news. Our frequent interactions with primary care physicians, sub-specialty consultants, and admission teams demand that we communi- cate effectively with our professional colleagues to provide high-quality medical care.

Some however, may still enter their senior year of medical school not being sure what career path is awaiting them. Two important ques-tions will help guide a student's decision as he or she considers emergen- cy medicine as a career. \"Is emergency medicine the right choice for me?\" and \"Am I the right choice for emergency medicine?\" These two questions are equally important. For students to make an informed decision about their interest in emergency medicine as a ca- reer, they should be knowledgeable about what lies ahead of them inresidency training and beyond. Although it is never too late to consider emergency medicine as a career, the earlier the better. Because most if not all students who will be receiving this manual are in their clinicalyears, we are approaching the advice section from the standpoint of a junior or senior medial student. Seek out resources at your home insti- tution; contact the emergency medicine clerkship director, research di-rector, residency director, or chairperson. Emergency medicine residents may also serve as a source of information. Consider contacting the emer- gency medicine chief resident at your institution. It is never too early tofind a clinical advisor who can provide advice as you embark along the road to find out what is the best specialty match for you. It is not man- datory that your clinical advisor practice the specialty that you are in-terested in; however, the best person to provide advice about our specialty is an emergency physician, with the same being said for other special- ties. You may also consider enlisting the help of your medical school toprovide you with a list of names and contact information for recent medical school graduates who are presently enrolled in an emergency medicine residency program. Valuable information can be obtained fromsomeone who was in your shoes just a year or two ago. Emergency med- icine residents can be a valuable resource for information pertaining to specific emergency medicine residency programs, the residency appli-cation and interview process, and general information regarding emer- gency medicine residency training. You should also consider spending some time shadowing one or more of the emergency medicine faculty members at your institution. This can be accomplished during evening or weekend hours when you have more free time. Shadowing serves a few purposes. First and foremost, it givesTwo important questions will help guide a student's decision as he orshe considers emergency medicineas a career. \"Is emergency medicinethe right choice for me?\" and \"AmI the right choice for emergencymedicine?\"The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 93you an opportunity for more exposure to the specialty of emergency medicine, thus allowing you to make a better-informed decision about your career interests. By spending some time in the emergency depart- ment, you will get to know the residents and attendings and becomemore familiar with how the emergency department works. Lastly, by spending time in the emergency department you can gain valuable clin- ical experience. To determine if emergency medicine is the right career for you, or if you have already decided, consider taking a look at the following resources; \u0084AAEM Rules of the Road for Medical Students is an online textbook writ- ten by emergency medicine residents and faculty that addresses many issues pertinent to medical students applying to emergency medicine residency training (www.aaemrsa.org/rules_road.shtml). \u0084The Medical Student Survival Guide is a resource for students applying to emergency medicine residency training (www.emra.org/ emra_bookstore.aspx?id=34122). \u0084An Applicant's Evaluation of an Emergency Medicine Internship and Residency (Koscove, 1990).

This article provides criteria used by emergency medicine residency selection committees to select their residents. In addition, a number of professional organizations within our specialty have dedicated information available for medical students, which can be of help to review; these include the American Academy of Emergency Medicine, the Emergency Medicine Residents Association, and the Clerk-ship Directors in Emergency Medicine. Other resources that students, regardless of career interest, should be aware of, they include the following: 1. AMA FREIDA Online is a database with more than 8,200 graduate medical education programs accredited by the ACGME, as well as more than 200 combined specialty programs (www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/2997.html). 2.

Emergency medicine is not for everyone. This can be said for every oth- er medical and surgical specialty. Emergency medicine is an increasing- ly popular specialty sought after by some of the best and brightestmedical students. Although not exclusionary, the specialty is becoming more competitive. In 2008, more than 98% of PGY-1 positions offered were filled on match day (National Resident Matching Program, 2008).Results from the 2007 match reported that the mean USMLE Step 1 score for U.S. seniors matching in emergency medicine residency train- ing programs was 220, and the mean for USMLE step 2 scores was 227.Each of these scores is above the national mean. To make the best decision possible about your career path, you should try to be as informed as possible. Try to get advice from multiple sources. Wewill review for you some of the unique aspects of our specialty that appear to be reasons why an increasing number of students choose emergency medicine. Emergency physicians pass the \"airplane litmus test.\" You prob-ably are asking yourself, what is the airplane litmus test? Remember these words, \"Is there a doctor on board?\" It's kind of a frightening statement if you are at 35,000 feet above the Atlantic Ocean. What other specialistcould you envision who is better prepared to handle an in-flight unex- pected medical emergency? Emergency medicine residency training em- phasizes an approach to crisis management. On a day-to-day basis, we arefaced with patients presenting across all spectrums of age, pathology, and severity. Our doors never close. The specialty of emergency medicine is actually growing in breadth and scope of practice, whereas many otherspecialties are becoming increasingly specialized and narrow in focus. Emergency physicians are becoming proficient with bedside ultrasonogra- phy, procedural sedation, airway management, and other skills. Over thepast decade, emergency physicians have also made tremendous inroads into a number of medical school administrations across the country serv- ing as course and clerkship directors, developing standardized patient andprocedural skills programs, and directing Simulation Centers. Some of the more exciting aspects of our specialty are highlighted here: 1. Every shift is different. This is an understatement. There is no routine day at work. Shift work also provides for some degree of flexibility, allowing you to balance your career with your personal life. 2. The approach to patient care is team based. The emergency physician leads the team of nurses, ancillary staff, residents, and students to help manage and treat a multitude of patients. Cohesive camaraderie is an appealing part of our specialty. 3. The emergency physician is the ultimate detective. Emergency physi- cians encounter endless numbers of undifferentiated patients. Some presentations are straightforward, and others require an in-depth, sys-tematically applied evaluation. Emergency physicians are the ultimate diagnosticians in the medical community. 4. Decisionmaking ability is critical. Almost on a daily basis, emergency physicians are faced with making critical decisions. Patients come into the emergency department in cardiac arrest, in respiratory distress, with acute abdominal pain, with an altered mental status, and more.Certain cases require split-second decisionmaking, whereas others al- low for more thought and reflection.Emergency medicine residency training emphasizes an approachto crisis management.The Emergency Medicine Clerkship Primer: A Manual for Medical Students \u0083 955. Varied practice opportunities. There are a wide variety of practice op- portunities and models available for emergency physicians. These rangefrom the university-based academic emergency medicine physician to the community-based emergency physicians. Many opportunities exist for fellowship training, including EMS and disaster medicine,toxicology, pediatric emergency medicine, sports medicine, ultrasound, administration, education, hyperbaric medicine, critical care, and more. Because of the diversity of training, emergency physicians can alsobranch out into other venues, including practicing cruise ship medi- cine, managing international outreach programs, managing large- venue domestic events, or providing medical command for citywideor statewide EMS systems. Despite the many opportunities within our specialty, emergency medi- cine is not a good career choice for everyone. As with any medical orsurgical specialty, there are some perceived negative aspects to the field. These include the following: 1. Lack of patient continuity and follow-up: Emergency physicians prac- tice in an environment that is very different from an office-based phy- sician. We do not have our own private patients. Therefore, we rarely have the opportunity for any long-term relationship with our patients.Although many emergency departments have their \"frequent flyers,\" the majority of physician-patient encounters are like two ships pass- ing in the night, never to be seen again. However, some emergencyphysicians call a patient after discharge to find out how the patient is feeling or contact the inpatient team or primary physician to obtain follow-up information. 2. Shift work. Although shift work has its benefits, it also has its draw- backs. Shift work can be taxing on the body and cause disruption in the sleep-wake cycle because of its effect on the circadian rhythm.Emergency physicians work days, evenings, nights, weekends, and holidays. Because the emergency department never closes, shift work scheduling requires that someone always be working, sometimes dur-ing less-than-desirable times. 3. Nonurgent complaints. Close to 50% of the patients seen in emer- gency departments across the country are for nonurgent complaints.Unlike the overdramatization of the emergency department on televi- sion, many patients we encounter will have low-acuity complaints such as a sore throat, cough, congestion, minor trauma, and the like.In reality, this is not the case because many patients we encounter will have run-of-the-mill complaints such as a sore throat, cough, conges- tion, minor trauma, and the like. Many of these cases can be adequatelycared for in an ambulatory care setting, but for any number of rea- sons, the emergency department serves as the primary site of health care for a large number of these patients. For some emergency physi-cians, this can be a source of frustration. 4. The emergency department is a fishbowl. For those who work in the emergency department, it is not uncommon for the practice of medi-cine to be viewed as if we are working in a fishbowl, meaning every- one can look in from the outside. This is commonly referred to as \"Monday morning quarterbacking.\" Everything is easier when lookedat in retrospect. A bad patient outcome or an unexpected turn of events can at times be inappropriately magnified. Some people do not handle this type of scrutiny well. There are certain qualities and personality traits that might suggest you are a \"fit\" for emergency medicine. Because of the unpredictable and96 \u0083 Advice for Medical Students Considering Emergency Medicine as a Careercollaborative approach to providing care in the emergency department, emergency physicians are extremely adept at multitasking, making time-sensitive decisions despite limited patient information, remaining calm under pressure, and thinking creatively in troubleshooting day-to-day problems. To excel in our specialty, you must also have excellent com-munication skills and enjoy working closely as a team with nurses and other ancillary staff. Remember, making a career choice must be an informed decision. Seek out a mentor and an advisor. Gather information and solicit advice from as many different sources as possible. Ask many questions. Making a ca- reer choice is one of the biggest decisions you will ever make in your life.Put the time in to make the right decision. Good luck and enjoy your rotation!
