Although less common, it is possible that a person can get COVID -19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own eyes, nose, or mouth. To slow the spread of COVID -19 in your community and facility, your child care program should fully implem ent and adhere to multiple prevention strategies . Most early childhood programs serve children in an age group that is not yet eligible for vaccination. Therefore, t his guidance emphasizes using multiple COVID -19 prevention strategies together to protect children and adults in early childhood programs. First and foremost, it is very important that everyone who is eligible are encouraged to get vaccinated and receive boosters . Requirements within these guidelines are underlined and must be followed. The LDOE has also provided sugges tions, examples of checklists, options, etc. in the appendices to assist child care programs in adhering to the guidelines and to improve upon their health and safety during this public health emergency. NOTE: These guidelines may change depending on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and O ffice of Public Health updates . CHECKLIST FOR OPEN CHILD CARE FACILITIES Staff must take everyday precautions to prevent the spread of COVID -19 such as: wear a mas k (strongly recommended for facilities in a parish with a High COVID -19 Community Level ), avoid close contact, avoid crowds and poorly ventilated areas, wash hands often, cover coughs and sneezes, clean and disinfect highly touched surfaces daily and monitor your health. Require sick children and staff to stay home. See Appendix 1. Plan isolation steps if a child becomes sick followed by cleaning and disinfecting processes. See Appendix 2 . Ensure adequate ventilation. See Appendix 3 . Mask requirements and r ecommendations. See Appendix 4 . Implement social distancing strategies. See Appendix 5 . Parent drop -off and pick -up processes and potential parent tours . See Appendix 6. Maintain cleaning and disinfecting efforts. See Appendix 7 . Ensure proper diapering techniques are followed. Ensure proper w ashing, feeding, and holding of children. See Appendix 8. Ensure healthy hand hygiene. See Appendix 9 . Ensure healthy food preparation and meal service. See Appendix 10 . Address vulnerable/high risk groups. See Appendix 1 1. Report outbreaks of COVID -19 identified in c hildren or staff to the appropriate Regional OPH and facilities . Comply with public health investigations . Issued August 15, 2022 2 Appendix 1: REQUIRE SICK CHILDREN AND STAFF TO STAY HOME Persons who have a fever of 100.4\u00b0F or above, or other signs of illness must not be admitted to the facility. Communicate to parents the importance of keeping children home when they are sick, steps being taken to ensure the health and safety of their children, etc. See th is sample letter to families. The letter to families should outline all health and safety precautions taken by your facility. Another sample can be found from Child Care Aware of America . Include asking the parent/guardian to confirm that the child has not been on fever reducing medication in the last 24 hours and does not have a sore throat, new uncontrolled cough that causes difficulty breathing (or chan ge to usual cough if child with chronic allergic/asthmatic cough), diarrhea, vomiting, stomachache, or new onset of severe headache, especially with a fever. Make a visual inspection of the child for signs of illness which could include flushed cheeks, ra pid breathing or difficulty breathing, fatigue, rash (other than diaper rash) or extreme/unusual fussiness. Communicate to staff the importance of being vigilant for symptoms and staying in touch with management if or when they start to feel sick. Follow procedures to ensure children and staff who come to the child care provider sick or become sick while at your location are placed in isolation and sent home as soon as possible. All symptomatic childre n and staff should seek testing for COVID -19, regardless of vaccination status. Educate yourself, staff and parents on Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS -C). Children, adolescents, or young adults who develop certain symptoms after having COVID -19 might have MIS-C. They should see a doctor if they had COVID -19, or have been in close contact with someone who had COVID -19, w ithin the past 6 weeks and now have the following. Ongoing fever AND one of the following: Stomach pain, diarrhea, vomiting, skin rash, blood shot eyes, d izziness or lightheadedness Appendix 2: PLAN ISOLATION STEPS IF A CHILD BECOMES SICK FOLLOWED BY CLEANING AND DISINFECTING PROCESSES There must be an isolation plan, including a cleaning and disinfecting process, for children who become sick. Have an isolation room or area (such as a cot in a corner of the classroom) that can be used to isolate a sick child. Follow CDC guidance on how to disinfect your building if someone is sick. If a sick child has been isolated in your facility, clean and disinfect surfaces in your isolation room or area after the sick child has gone home. COVID -19 Cases Follow CDC guidance for isolation . Individuals who are unable to mask through day 10 should isolate at home for a full 10 days. They may return early if they meet the criteria for \"Removing Your Mask\" in the isolation guidance. COVID -19 Exposures Anyone with a known or suspected exposure to COVID -19 should wear a well- fitting mask or respirator around others for 10 days from their last exposure, regardless of vaccination status or history of prior Issued August 15, 2022 3 infection. They should also get tested at least 5 full days after their last exposure, even if they don' t develop symptoms. For students who are unable to mask, ECE programs should consider other prevention strategies - such as encouraging vaccination for those who are eligible , improving ventilation, increasing physical distancing between students, and tes ting. Appendix 3: ENSURE ADEQUATE VENTILATION Adequate ventilation should be ensured. Consider how you can bring in as much fresh air into your child care center as possible. Bringing fresh, outdoor air into your center helps keep virus particles from concentrating inside. Bring in as much outdoor air as possible. Ensure heating, ventilations, and air conditioning (HVAC) settings are maximizing ventilation Filter and/or clean the air in your facility Use exhaust fans in restrooms and kitchen Open windows in transportation vehicles, when it is safe to do so Consider having activities, classes, or lunches outdoors when circumstances allow . Appendix 4 : MASK REQUIREMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Masking is not required statewide ; however, facilities can choose to require masking for staff, families, and visitors. Universal indoor masking is recommended for any child care site in a parish with a High COVID -19 Community Level . COVID -19 Community Levels should be checked weekl y to evaluate the need for masking in your site. While outdoors, individuals do not n eed to mask . It is strongly recommended that any child over two years of age wear a mask. Transportation: o Buses and vans operated by public or private early childhood providers are no longer included in the federal mask requirement for transit. Early childhood providers should use COVID -19 Community Levels to determine their policy for wearing masks on buses or vans, but can continue to require universal masking regardless of Community Level. Appendix 5: IMPLEMENT SOCIAL DISTANCING STRATEGIES Distancing strategies should be implemented when COVID -19 Community Level is High or when there is an outbreak . Ensure that children's naptime mats (or cribs) are spaced out as much as possible, ideally 6 feet apart. Place children head to toe in order to further reduce the potential for viral spread. Masks should not be worn while sleeping. Cohorting can be used to limit the number of people who come in contact with each other . Maintain static groups as much as possible to prevent quarantin ing additional children and staff. If possible, child care classes should include the same group each day, and the same child care teacher should remain with the same group each day. Issued August 15, 2022 4 If cafeterias or communal dining halls will be used, ensure separate \"classrooms\" or cohorts remain 6 feet apart while eating. Consider staggering when classrooms eat, so children can maintain their small groups. Consider staggering playground times for groups of children. Alter or halt daily group activities that may promo te transmission. It is recommended that field trips and special events be halted during time s of High COVID -19 Community Level. Field trips are allowed but should be he ld outside, whenever possible. Programs can consider altering or halting field trips when COVID -19 Community Level is H igh. Special events, performances, or holiday events (such as, but not limited to, PreK Graduation, magic shows, Zoo to You, or Soccer Shots) are allowed but should be held outside, whenever possible. Program s can consider a ltering or halt ing special events when COVID -19 Community Level is H igh. Appendix 6: ADJUST PARENT DROP -OFF AND PICK -UP PROCESSES Parent drop- off and pick -up processes may be adjusted. Parents must be allowed in the building for full access to their children, to meet the teacher, etc. It is strongly recommended that the parent wear a mask while inside the facility when the parish COVID -19 Community Level is High . A provider can have a parent drop -off and pick -up process at curbside to limit direct contact between parents and staff members. See the procedures below to screen children before the parent leaves the facility. Child drop off and pick up can be done curbside or in a room or foyer that does not allow the parent inside the center or does not lead the parent through the center. The parent is encouraged to wear a mask if they enter the room or foyer. Have child care providers come outside the facility to pick up the children as t hey arrive. The plan for curbside drop off and pick up should limit direct contact between parents and staff members and adhere to social distancing recommendations. Allow center staff to sign in and out children. May consider staggering arrival and drop off times for parents. Hand hygiene stations can be set up at the entrance of the facility, so that children can clean their hands before they enter. If a sink with soap and water is not available, provide hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol and supe rvise its use. Keep hand sanitizer out of the reach of children before and after use . ADJUST POTENTIAL PARENT TOURS Tours for potential new parents or family members can occur physically during the day . Consider implementing the following precautions : Only parents or family members from one household are allowed into the building at a time. All visiting parents or family members should wear a mask when the parish COVID -19 Community Level is high and socially distance. The parents or family members should not enter a classroom or area where children are present . If children are outside, the parents can enter the empty classroom for a tour . Consider offering tours virtually or before and after center operations. Issued August 15, 2022 5 Appendix 7: MAINTAIN CLEANING AND DISINFECTING EFFORTS At least once a day, clean surfaces, bathrooms, and objects that are frequently touched, such as doorknobs, light switches, classroom sink handles, countertops, toilet training po tties, etc. o In most situations, regular cleaning (at least once a day) is enough to sufficiently remove viruses th at may be on surfaces. However, if certain conditions apply, you may choose to clean more frequently AND disinfect surfaces and objects if certain condition apply which may include: High transmission of COVID -19 in your community. The space is occupied by people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID -19. Schedule and follow additional procedures for cleaning and disinfecting including cleaning and sanitizing toys and bedding. All cleaning materials must be kept secure and out of reach of children. Do not share toys with other groups of infants or toddlers, unless they are washed and sanitized before being moved from one group to another. Clean and sanitize toys. o Reduce the number of toys in classrooms. o Toys that children have placed in their mouths or that are otherwise contaminated by body secretions or excretions should be set aside until they are cleaned by hand by a person wea ring gloves. o Children's books, like other paper- based materials, are not considered a high risk for transmission and do not need additional cleaning or disinfection procedures. Clean and disinfect bedding. o Keep each child's bedding separate, and consider storing in individually labeled bins, cubbies or bags. o Cots and mats should be labeled for each child. o Bedding that touches a child's skin should be cleaned at a minimum of weekly or before use by another child. Appendix 8: ENSURE PROPER WASHING, FEEDING AND HOLDING OF CHILDREN Proper washing, feeding and holding of children must be ensured. It is important to comfort crying, sad, and/or anxious children and they often need to be held. When washing, feeding, or holding children, teachers can protect thems elves by washing their hands frequently. Teachers should wash their hands, neck and anywhere touched by a child's secretions. Teachers should change the child's clothes if secretions are on the child's clothes. Infants, toddlers, and their teachers should have multiple changes of clothes on hand in the child care center. Issued August 15, 2022 6 Appendix 9: ENSURE HEALTHY HAND HYGIENE All children and staff should was h their hand with soap and water at the following times: o Arrival and exit of the facility and after breaks o Before and after preparing food or drinks o Before and after eating or handling food, or feeding children o Before and after handling infant bottles o Before and after administering medication or medical ointment o Before and after diapering o After using the toile t or helping a child use the bathroom o After coming in contact with bodily fluid o After handling animals or cleaning up animal waste o After playing outdoors or in sand After handling garbage , wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol before and after: o Touching your eyes, nose, or mouth o Touching your mask o Touching an item or surface that is frequently touched by other people such as door handles Supervise children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent ingestion. Assist children with handwashing, including infants who cannot wash hands alone. After assisting children with handwashing, staff should also wash their hands. Appendix 10: ENSURE HEALTHY FOOD PREPARATION AND MEAL SERVICE Healthy food preparation and meal service must be ensured. If feasible, remove or limit additional staff coming into classrooms during mealtimes. During outbreaks or High COVID -19 Community Level, a s feasible, have children and staff eat meals outdoors or in well ventilated classrooms or while maintaining distance as much as possible. If meals are typically served family -style, plate each child's meal to serve it so that multiple children are not using the same serving utensils. Food preparation should not be done by the same staff who diaper children. Sinks used for food preparation should not be used for any other purposes. Teachers must ensure children wash hands prior to and immediately after eating. Teachers must wash their hands before preparing food and after helping children to eat. Issued August 15, 2022 7 Appendix 11: ADDRESS VULNERABLE AND HIGH RISK GROUPS Vulnerable and high risk groups must be addressed. Based on current information, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID -19. To protect those at higher risk, it's important that everyone practices healthy hygiene behaviors. It is important to e ncourage vaccination among all eligible groups, especially those at high risk for severe illness. COVID -19 usually cause mild symptoms in children . However, a small but growing percentage of children have been reported to have more severe illness. See Appendix 1 for information on MIS -C. If you have children with underlying health conditions, talk to their parents about their risk for COVID -19. Follow children's care plans for underlying health conditions. If you have children with disabilities, talk to their paren ts about how their children can continue to receive the services they need. Employers should also understand the potential mental health strains for workers during the COVID -19 pandemic. Early childhood program administrators should educate workers on men tal health awareness and share available mental health and counseling services. Employers should provide a supportive work environment for workers coping with job stress and building resilience , and managing "}
