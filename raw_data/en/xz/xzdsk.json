The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety of the trial medicines and their effects in the reduce the risks of the disease. In addition, to document the profile of Symptomatic COVID 19 patients as per Siddha Principles. Trial Design A Double Blinded, Three arm, Single Centre, Placebo Controlled, Exploratory and comparative Randomized Controlled Trial Participants Patients who were admitted to the COVID Care Centre at Govt. Institute of Medical Sciences. Noida in India will be recruited. These will be patients with Mild and Moderate symptoms with laboratory confirmed COVID 19 (RT - PCR Tested Positive) aged 18-65, willing and consenting to participate. Intervention and comparator Arm I: Decaffeinated Tea (Placebo - similar in taste and appearance to the other Two Decoctions), 60 Ml Morning and Night after Food, along with standard Allopathy Treatment for 10 days. Arm II: Nilavembu Kudineer (The Siddha Medicines which is used as a standard Anti-Viral drug for the past Pandemics by Siddha Physicians) 60 Ml Morning and Night after Food, along with standard Allopathy Treatment for 10 days. Arm III: Kaba Sura Kudineer (The Siddha Medicine which is proposed to be used as a Treatment for COVID 19 based on Siddha Literature) 60 Ml Morning and Night after Food, along with standard Allopathy Treatment for 10 days. The investigational drugs are registered products under the Govt.of India and bought from GMP Certified Manufacturing Units. Main Outcomes Primary outcomes: 1. Reduction in Viral load of SARS-CoV-2 at the end of treatment (10 days). 2. Time taken to convert Patient from symptomatic to Asymptomatic based on Reduction in clinical symptoms (10 days). 3. Effect of drugs inflammatory markers (IL6,) at the end of treatment (10 days). 4. Reduction in hospital stay time (20 days follow up). (Based on RT PCR CT Value 3rd, 6th if needed 10th day). (Based on IL 6 Value needed 10th day or IL6 value on turning negative. (entry level/exit level). Secondary outcomes (10 days): 1. Reduction in use of Intensive Supportive Care. 2. Reduction in incidence of complications (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, other systemic complications). 3. MuLBSTA score for viral pneumonia (multinodular infiltration, hypo-lymphocytosis, bacterial co infection, Total Leucocyte Count (TLC  0.8 x 109/L), smoking history, hyper-tension and age) score. 4. Laboratory markers (Haematological & Biochemical Markers). 5. Adverse events/effects Siddha-based measurements. 6. Siddha Udaliyal assessment by using Yakkai Ilakkanam (YI) Tool to diagnose body condition for covid-19 patients. Randomisation The assignment of the participants into 3 Groups will be allocated in 1:1:1 Ratio through randomization Blocks in Microsoft Excel by a Statistician who is not involved in the study. The allocation scheme will be made by another statistician by using a closed envelope after the assessment of eligibility and Informed consent procedures. The groups will be balanced for age and sex with 3:1 Ratio in each group for mild: severe COVID-19 symptoms. Blinding The Study is Double Blinded. Participants and Investigators were blinded. Numbers to be randomized (Sample size) Sample size could not be calculated, Since there are no prior trials on KSK and NVK as a comparative trial. In addition, there are no prior trials on KSK and NVK in this region. A total Number of 120 Patients, 40 each in 3 groups will be recruited in 1:1:1 Ratio. Trial Status Protocol Number : SCRUND GIMS Noida Study 1,Version: 2.0 Protocol Date : 20.08.2020 The recruitment period is completed for the trial. The Trial started its recruitment on 22.8.2020. We anticipate study including data analysis will finish in January 2021. This is to state that it was a late submission from authors for publication of the protocol to the BMC, after enrolment in the study was over. Trial Registration The trial protocol was registered with CTRI (Clinical Trial Registry of India) and number is CTRI/2020/08/027286 on 21.08.2020 Full Protocol The full Protocol is attached as an additional file, Accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).
