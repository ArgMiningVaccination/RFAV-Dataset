Because the truth is, modern life isn't built with your health in mind, and navigating the transition from benchmark \"health\" to true wellness without guidance can feel like its own full-time job. That's where I come in. I'm here to identify the habits, mindsets, and practices blocking your family from healing and guide you through the gentle evolution of holistic habit building. Forget the old model of health care and hack my knowledge, education, and years of trial and error to start feeling better with a step-by-step plan that (actually) works. AND STARTING A HOLISTIC LIVING PRACTICE IS NO EXCEPTION - WHERE DO YOU EVEN BEGIN, AM I RIGHT? Modern life is complicated, Take back your family's health in three simple steps: REMOVE TOXINS, PATHOGENS, HABITS, AND MINDSETS THAT ARE CREATING HARMFUL BUILD UP REPLENISH THE BODY AND MIND WITH SIMPLE, SUSTAINABLE HOME AND LIFESTYLE SHIFTS RESOLVE ROOT CAUSES AND PATTERNS TO BREAK THE \"TREAT & REPEAT\" HEALTH CYCLE Hi, I'm Tessie - integrative practitioner, mama, and non-toxic lifestyle guide with specialized training in helping people manage the habit changes needed for optimal health and healing, regardless if they're 30 months or 30 years old. #1 #2 #3 big legacies have small beginnings My story began like any other: A first time mom working alongside my husband to raise two babies, considering days I had three square meals and two matching socks on my feet a major win. Life was busy, but good. We'd adopted non-toxic living in our household and were tackling each day as it came with love and a faith that answers would be available when we needed them. Imagine my surprise when after months of searching for help, we couldn't find the explanations or support we needed to address the chronic pain my 10 month old son was experiencing. The health field I'd known my whole life was failing us, forcing us to open new doors to find the answers to healing. This was the start of my journey down the pediatric holistic medicine rabbit hole, a search that only intensified when at 2 years old, my son became severely ill with PANDAS, soon followed by my daughter's vaccine injury. Once again, Western medicine had no answers or solutions for us and my previous work in functional and naturopathic medicine didn't have much to say about the treatment of children. So I began treating them myself, flying around the country to glean wisdom from brilliant mentors. This journey brought me to the realization that the health challenges my family experienced were far from unique and my role as a practitioner allows me to be of service to other parents. Ultimately my goal is to help you become the healer of your own household and educate you for your own skillset to grow. Our work together isn't about: PERFECTIONISM SHAMING PREACHING HOW it WORKS ASSESS CORRECT MAINTAIN We'll start by assessing your current home and lifestyle health. Whether you're seeking treatment for yourself or your whole household, we'll work together to get a full picture of where you're at right now. Now that we have a clear idea of what's out of balance, we'll create a step by step plan to get you and/or your child back into alignment by treating or changing the issue - treating root causes, changing harmful habits. Once we've restored the body, mind, and environment to a healthy equilibrium, I'll offer support and resources for maintaining balance and eliminating cyclical poor health patterns from your life. 1 2 3 Busy?

We initially started to help my daughter with her behavior and severe rashes but it ended up being so much more than that. She helped us heal my daughter but also the rest of our family AND she taught us how to do it ourselves! I've never met a practitioner that works the way she does and I'm so grateful we found her!
