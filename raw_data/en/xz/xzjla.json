Every month, over 300 tribal children from Dang and border villages in Maharashtra are administered 'suvarna prashan' drops at this hospital to boost their immunity and mental power. The ayurvedic hospital in Ahwa has tied up with anganwadis and primary health centre across Dang district where health workers now immunize children with 'suvarna prashan' along with modern medicines. 'Survana prashan' is an ayurvedic immunisation programme of ancient times. This medicine is prepared from 'survarna bhasma'-pure processed gold powder, pure honey, pure or medicated ghee and ayurvedic herbs. Dr Krutika Chaudhary, medical officer of Ahwa ayurvedic hospital, told TOI, \"In the ancient period when immunisation was not in existence, the children and infants were given survana prashan drops to boost their immunity and mental power. Survana prasham is not an alternative of modern day immunisation.\" She said survana prasham vaccination is being given at the ayurvedic hospital in Ahwa for the last four-and-a-half-years. The drops are given to children from 0-16 years of age. The children are given the dose on every 27th day of the month for at least one year. It facilitates healthy growth and development of sharir dhatus (body tissues), improves complex of skin and protects children against infectious diseases known in ayurvedic science as 'grah badha'. Survana prasham improves children's immunity, mental strength, memory power, grasping power, attitude, digestion, speech along with physical strength and reduces complications during teething period, she added. Dr Krutika said, \"Even parents living in urban area should give 'suvarna bhasma' to their children. There are ayurvedic pharmacies where specialized bhasma is available. However, the dosage should be given as per the instructions "}
