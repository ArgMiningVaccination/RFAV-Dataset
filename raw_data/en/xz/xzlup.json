Lifestyle change is the most significant contributor to increased obesity cases. Poor feeding habits, sedentary behavior, and reduced physical activity are some of the leading causes of obesity. However, gaining weight is not the only problem. The issue arises when the body gains more weight and does not lose it. Therefore, it puts one at risk of lifestyle diseases such as cancer, joint and heart problems, and other organ failures. Health experts advise people to live a healthy lifestyle by exercising and eating a healthy diet. Although these practices may help reduce significant weight, they fail to address the root cause of weight gain. Dietary supplements have become popular in managing weight loss issues. These supplements claim to have 100% natural ingredients that help you lose weight faster. Not all these supplements are safe for use. Some of them contain artificial ingredients that may adversely affect one's health. [PhenGold](https://tnhealthandwellness.com/phengold) is a new weight loss supplement on the market. It has powerful ingredients that improve your overall health and assist in your weight loss journey. Unlike other supplements, it uses a different approach to enhance the body's natural fat-burning process. What is PhenGold? PhenGold is a powerful weight loss supplement that claims to help eliminate excess fat from the body. The supplement has gained massive popularity over the past few years due to its effectiveness in assisting people to lose weight. In addition to weight loss, the supplement helps improve energy levels, mental performance, and moods. The powerful formula does not interfere with the body's natural process by subjecting it to stress to achieve any results. It improves the body's fat-burning capabilities, making it a safer weight-loss option. The supplement also controls hunger pangs and increases satiety. Therefore, it contains the total amount of calories taken. It helps you live a disciplined life, the critical principle of losing weight. The manufacturing process abides by all GMP guidelines. It is also manufactured in an FDA-approved facility; thus, there is no need to worry about the safety and effectiveness of the supplement.

[Try PhenGold now and experience the difference!](https://tnhealthandwellness.com/phengold) How Does PhenGold Work? PhenGold contains a wide range of ingredients that use a different weight-loss approach. Low metabolism is the primary reason for reduced weight loss. Metabolism is a complex biochemical process that transforms food into energy the body can use. It is an essential function that sustains life in all living organisms. It comprises two physiological functions: anabolism and catabolism. As people grow old, metabolism reduces, thus contributing to weight gain. Age, inadequate calorie intake, sedentary lifestyle, and hormonal imbalance are some main factors contributing to slow metabolism. Reduced metabolism causes the body's energy levels to decrease. PhenGold revs up metabolism and ensures all food consumed is converted to energy. It also speeds up the fat oxidation process, which helps remove stubborn fat from different body parts, such as the belly, thighs, and neck. Therefore, it helps improve body shape and promotes lean muscles. Apart from boosting metabolism, the supplement suppresses food appetite. It prevents users from over-eating, thereby limiting the amount of calories taken. As a result, the body turns to stored fat as its primary energy source, leading to weight loss. Besides weight loss, the supplement addresses reduced energy levels and mental performance. Stress causes the overproduction of cortisol, making the body store fat. Stress also leads to overeating as a coping mechanism. PhenGold helps reduce the effects of stress, which is a primary contributor to weight gain.

It contains a unique compound blend that speeds up metabolism and fat burning. Green tea is rich in catechins, specifically EGCG, crucial in weight management. The chemical increases thermogenesis, the process through which the body burns fat to produce heat, leading to increased daily calorie expenditure. Studies reveal that green tea improves insulin sensitivity, which is crucial in glucose regulation. It helps the body regulate blood sugar levels, thus preventing sugar spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels. It also stabilizes appetite and food cravings, which contribute to increased weight. Green Coffee Green coffee beans are a popular ingredient in weight loss supplements. Green coffee extract is obtained from unroasted coffee beans. Studies reveal that unroasted coffee beans contain high amounts of caffeine, making them more bioavailable. It also contains chlorogenic acid, which is responsible for several health benefits. Chlorogenic acid helps regulate blood sugar levels by preventing glucose absorption in the intestine, reducing fat storage caused by high blood sugar. Additionally, it enhances metabolism, which aids in losing weight. L-Theanine L-theanine is a naturally occurring amino acid obtained from tea leaves. Studies reveal that it can help reduce stress levels and improve focus by providing a calming and relaxing effect on the brain. L-theanine reduces stress and anxiety, aiding in weight loss. Stress causes emotional eating that leads to calorie over-consumption. By promoting relaxation, l-theanine helps individuals manage their eating habits. L-theanine helps improve focus and concentration, which enhances physical performance. It also enables you to adhere to your weight loss journey and remain attentive to meal plans and exercise routines. L-Tyrosine L-tyrosine is also an amino acid that triggers the production of neurotransmitters and hormones such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. It is crucial in mood regulation, stress management, and energy production. Studies reveal that improving neurotransmitter function indirectly promotes weight loss by preventing emotional eating that could lead to weight gain. L-tyrosine is crucial in synthesizing thyroid hormones, which help regulate metabolism. Individuals with poor thyroid function struggle with weight loss due to reduced metabolism. Taking l-tyrosine can help boost thyroid production, thereby assisting in weight gain.

It contains capsaicin, an active compound responsible for the spicy flavor. Studies reveal that capsaicin has several health benefits, including weight loss. Capsaicin increases thermogenesis, the process by which the body produces heat to burn calories. It also increases the body's metabolic rate and improves energy expenditure. In addition, cayenne pepper improves satiety and reduces food cravings. Therefore, it limits the amount of food taken, which helps in overall weight management efforts. Caffeine Caffeine is a natural stimulant found in tea and coffee. [Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30335479/) reveal that caffeine helps weight loss by increasing metabolic rate and reducing appetite. Caffeine boosts metabolism by increasing thermogenesis, which leads to an increase in calorie expenditure. It also increases energy expenditure by stimulating the nervous system, thereby increasing heart rate. Caffeine also helps in appetite suppression, thus reducing the amount of calories consumed. DMAE DMAE is a naturally occurring compound produced in the brain. It can also be obtained from different food sources. It helps improve cognitive function and potentially assists in weight loss. DMAE triggers the production of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that enhances the learning process. Other studies reveal that DMAE can help improve lipid metabolism and increase thermogenesis, thus helping burn more calories. Vitamin B3, B6 and B12 Vitamins B3, B6, and B12 assist in different body processes directly linked to weight loss. Vitamin B3, also known as niacin, triggers food conversion to energy. It helps convert starch, fats, and proteins to produce energy. Vitamin B6 helps in the production of neurotransmitters that help in mood and appetite regulation. It also boosts metabolism and the body's energy levels. Vitamin B12 promotes red blood cell formation, DNA synthesis, and nerve function. It also helps in boosting energy levels and metabolism.
