Vol. 17- 9PREFACE The Idaho Administrative Bulletin is an electronic-only, online m o n t h l y p u b l i c a t i o n o f t h e O f f i c e o f t h e Administrative Rules Coordinator, Department of Administration, that is published pursuant to Section 67-5203, Idaho Code. The Bulletin is a compilation of all official rulem aking notices, official rule text, executive orders of the Governor, and all legislative do cuments affecting rules that ar e statutorily required to be published in the Bulletin. It may also include other rules-rel ated documents an agency may wa nt to make public through the Bulletin. State agencies are required to p rovide public notice of all rul emaking actions and must invite public input. This is done through negotiated rulemaking procedures or after proposed rulemaking has been initiated. The public receives notice that an agency has initiated proposed rulemaking procedu res through the Idaho Administrative Bulletin and a legal notice (Public Notice of Intent) that publishes in author ized newspapers throughout the state. The legal notice provides reasonable opportunity for the public to participate w hen a proposed rule publishes in the Bulletin. Interested parties may submit written comments to the agency or request public hearings of the agency, if none have been scheduled. Such submissions or requests must be presented to the agency within the time and manner specified in the individual \"Notice of Rul emaking - Proposed Rule\" for ea ch proposed rule that is published in the Bulletin. Once the comment period closes, the agency considers fully all comments and information submitted regarding the proposed rule. Changes may be made to the proposed rule at this stage of the rulemaking, but changes must be based on comments received and must be a \"logical outgrowth\" of the proposed rule. The agency may now adopt and publish the pending rule. A pending rule is \"pending\" legislati ve review for final approval. The pending rule is the agency's final version of the rulemaking that will be forwarded to the legislature for review and final approval. Comment periods and public hearings are not provided for when t he agency adopts a temporary or pending rule. CITATION TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN The Bulletin is identified by the calendar year and issue numbe r. For example, Bulletin 13-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2013; Bulletin 14-1 refers to the first Bulletin issued in calendar year 2014. Volume numbers, which proceed from 1 to 12 in a given year, correspond to the months of publication, i.e.; V olume No. 13-1 refers to January 2013; V olume No. 13-2 refers to February 2013; and so forth. Example: The Bulletin p ublished in January 2014 is cited as V olume 14-1. The December 2015 Bulletin is cited as V olume 15-12 . RELATIONSHIP TO THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE CODE The Idaho Administrative Code is an electronic-only, online compilation of all final and enf orceable administrative rules of the state of Idaho that are of full for ce and effect. Any temporary rule that is adopted by an agency and is of force and effect is codified into the Administ rative Code upon becoming effective. All pending rules that have been approved by the legislature during the legislati ve session as final rules and any temporary rules that are extended supplement the Administrative Code. These rules are co dified into the Administrative Code upon becoming effective. Because proposed and pending rules are not enforceab le, they are published in the Administrative Bulletin only and cannot be codified into the Administrative Code until approved as final. To determine if a particular rule remains in effect or whether any amendments have been made to the rule, refer to the Cumulative Rulemaking Index . Link to it on the Administrative Rules homepage at adminrules.idaho.gov . THE DIFFERENT RULES PUBLISHED IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Idaho's administrative rulemaking process, governed by the Admi nistrative Procedure Act, Title 67, Chapter 52, Idaho Code, comprises distinct rulemaking actions: negotiated, proposed, temporary, pending and final rulemaking. Not all rulemakings incorporate or require all of these actions . At a minimum, a rulemaking includes proposed, pending and final rulemaking. Many rules are adopted as tempora ry rules when they meet the required statutory criteria and agencies must, when feasible, engage in negotiated rulemaking at the beginning of the process to facilitate consensus building. In the majority of cases, the pr ocess begins with proposed rulemaking and ends with the final rulemaking. The following is a brief explanation of each type of rule.IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 9 September 6, 2017 - Vol. 17- 91. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING Negotiated rulemaking is a process in which all interested pers ons and the agency seek consensus on the content of a rule through dialogue. Agencies are required to conduct ne gotiated rulemaking whenever it is feasible to do so. The agency files a \"Notice of Int ent to Promulgate - Negotiated Rulemaking\" for publication in the Administrative Bulletin inviting interested persons to contact the agency if i nterested in discussing the agency's intentions regarding the rule changes. This process is intended to result in the for mulation of a proposed rule and the initiation of regular rulemaking procedures. One result, however, may also be that re gular (proposed) rulemaking is not initiated and no further action is taken by the agency. 2. PROPOSED RULEMAKINGA proposed rulemaking is an action by an agency wherein the age ncy is proposing to amend or repeal an existing rule or to adopt a new rule. Prior to the adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule, the agen cy must publish a \"Notice of Rulemaking - Proposed Rule\" in the Bulletin. This notice mus t include very specific information regarding the rulemaking including all relevant state or federal statutory au thority occasioning the rulemaking, a non-technical description of the changes being made, any associated costs, gu idance on how to participate through submission of written comments and requests for public hearings, and the text of the proposed rule in legislaitve format. 3. TEMPORARY RULEMAKIN G Temporary rules may be adopted only when the governor finds tha t it is necessary for: a) protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or b) compliance with deadlines in amendments to governing law or f ederal programs; or c) conferring a benefit. If a rulemaking meets one or more of these criteria, and with t he Governor's approval, the agency may adopt and make a temporary rule effective prior to receiving legislative authorization and without allowing for any public input. The law allows an agency to make a temporary rule immediately e ffective upon adoption. A temporary rule expires at the conclusion of the next succeeding regular legislative session unless the rule is extended by concurrent resolution, is replaced by a fina l rule, or expires under its o wn terms. 4. PENDING RULEMAKING A pending rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency und er regular rulemaking procedures and remains subject to legislative review before it becomes a final, enforc eable rule. When a pending rule is published in the Bulletin, the agency is required to include certain information in the \"Notice of Rulemaking - Pending Rule.\" This includes a statement giving the reasons for adopting the rule, a statement regarding when the rule becomes effective, a description of how it differs from the proposed rule, and ide ntification of any fees being imposed or changed. Agencies are required to republish the text of the pending rule when substantive changes have been made to the proposed rule. An agency may adopt a pending rule that varies i n content from that which was originally proposed if the subject matter of the rule remains the same, the pending ru le change is a logical outgrowth of the proposed rule, and the original notice was written so as to assure that member s of the public were reasonably notified of the subject. It is not always necessary to republish all the text of the pen ding rule. 5. FINAL RULEMAKINGA final rule is a rule that has been adopted by an agency under the regular rulemaking procedures and is of full force and effect. IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 10 September 6, 2017 - Vol. 17 -9HOW TO USE THE IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN Rulemaking documents produced by state agencies and published i n the Idaho Administrative Bulletin a r e organized by a numbering schematic. Each state agency has a two-digit identification code number known as the \"IDAPA\" number. (The \"IDAPA\" Codes are listed in the alphabetical/nume rical index at the end of this Preface.) Within each agency there are divisions or departments to which a two-digit \"TITLE\" number is assigned. There are \"CHAPTER\" numbers assigned within the Title and the rule text i s divided among major sections that are further subdivided into subsections. An example IDAPA number is as foll ows: IDAPA 38.05.01.200.02.c.ii. \"IDAPA\" refers to Administrative Rules in general that are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and are required by this act to be published in the Idaho Administrativ e Code and the Idaho Administrative Bulletin. 1. \"38.\" refers to the Idaho Department of Administration \"05.\" refers to Title 05 , which is the Department of Admi nistration's Division of Purch asing \"01.\" refers to Chapter 01 of Title 05, \"Rules of the Division of Purchasing\" \"200.\" refers to Major Section 200, \"Content of the Invitation to Bid\" \"02.\" refers to Subsection 200. 02. \"c.\" 200.02. c. \"ii.\" refers to Subsection 200.02.c. ii. DOCKET NUMBERING SYSTEM Internally, the Bulletin is organized sequentially using a rule docketing system. Each rulemaking that is filed with the Coordinator is assigned a \"DOCKET NUMBER.\" The docket numbe r is a series of separated by a hyphen \"-\", r (the two-digit agency code) in the Bulletin. The following example is a breakd own of a typical rule docket \"38-\" denotes the agency's this case the Department of Administration. \"0501-\" refers to the TITLE AND CHAPTER numbers of the agency rule being promulgated; in this case the Division of Purchasing (TITLE 05 ), Rules of the Division of Purchasing (Chapter 01). \"1401\" denotes the year and sequential order of the docket being publ ished; in this case the numbers refer to the first rulemaking action published in calendar year 2014. A subsequent rulemaking on this same rule chapter in calendar year 2014 would be designated as \" 1402\". The docket number in this scenario would be 38-0501-1402 . Within each Docket, only the affected sections of chapters are printed. (See Sections Affected Index in each Bulletin for a listing of these.) The individual sections affec ted are printed in the Bulletin sequentially (e.g. Section \"200\" appears before Section \"345\" and so on). Whenever the seq uence of the numbering is broken the following statement will appear: (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS)IDAHO ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN PREFACE Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 11 September 6, 2017 -

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Historically the Feed and Fertilizer (F&F) Laboratory's primary function (>90%) has been regulatory/ enforcement testing. However, it occasionally accepts public se rvice samples on a fee basis. Since January 2014, the lab had 28 customers totaling $18,114.18 of business. Of that a mount, 84% or $15,223.35 came from two other State Agencies from Oregon and Michigan that use the ISDA F&F Lab bec ause of its extremely low prices. The primary mission of the F&F Lab is to provide enforcement testing servic es in an accurate and timely manner. These public service samples, for the most part, do not even benefit Idaho r esidents and tie up valuable lab space and time. Therefore, the ISDA has halted voluntary service sample testing as of January 1st, 2017. The ISDA is repealing the rule for voluntary public services. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: No fiscal impact is expected.

PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, o r an agency, not later than September 20, 2017. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabili ties. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior t o the hearing, to the agency ad dress below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The 2016 Idaho Legislature passed HB 643, which established Sec tion 54-1001A, Idaho Code that directs the Idaho Division of Building Safety to promulgate rules governing the use, inspection and safety of submersible well pumps in Idaho's lakes, rivers, ponds and streams. This rulemak ing amends the electrical c ode relating to installation and safety requirements of non-listed submersible well pumps in Idaho's waters where authorized swimming and marine activities take place. The DBS conducted negotiated rule making with the pump and electrical industry in order to develop these amendments. Pursuant to the negotiated r ule notice, which published in the May 2016 Administrative Bulletin under Docket No. 07-0106-11601, meeting s occurred in 2016, which included informal collaborative meetings with industry, and these rule changes we re again discussed in the 2017 Electrical Board meetings. This rulemaking would amend the 2017 National Electric Code (NE C) to add a new section permitting the installation of disconnects grouped in one- and two-family dwel ling units where multiple feeders enter the building in certain circumstances. Additionally, the rulemaking provides exceptions to several articles of the NEC addressing the installation of submersible well pumps in swimming and marine a reas, and the electrical equipment used therein such installations. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was conducted. The Notice of Intent to Promulgate Rules - Negotiate d Rulemaking was published in the May 4, 2016 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 16-5, pages 38 through 39 .

The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 39-4107 and 39-4109, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, o r an agency, not later than September 20, 2017. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabili ties. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior t o the hearing, to the agency ad dress below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The 2012 International Residential Code (IRC) is currently util ized by building jurisdictions throughout the state; however, it does not provide adequate guidance related t o the construction of \"Tiny Homes.\" The construction of tiny homes in Idaho has increased significantly in the past several years and there is a need to establish specific residential code provisions to properly address some of the uni que characteristics of tiny homes. The tiny home provisions contained in this rulemaking would be added as an ap pendix to the IRC, and may be adopted by building code jurisdictions to address the installation of such homes. A dditionally, because of increases to allowable design stresses in the 2012 International Building Code (IBC), masonry allowable stress design (ASD) lap lengths could exceed strength design laps. Placing a limit on the required la p length corrects this problem and provides consistency between masonry design methods. This rulemaking adds several provisions to the residential code (IRC) in the form of a new appendix addressing certain aspects of \"Tiny Homes.\" These include key definitions, as well as provisions related to ceiling height, lofts, stairways and ladders, and escape and rescue roof access window s. This rulemaking will also add an amendment that will place a limit on the required length of reinforcement lap splices for allowable stress design (ASD) of masonry. It will make the allowable stress maximum lap length equivalent to the current strength design maximum lap length. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/ANEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was conducted. The Notice of Intent to Promulgate Rules - Negotiate d Rulemaking was published in the March 1, 2017 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 17-3, pages 16 through 17 . INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following i s a brief synopsis of why the materials cited are being incorporated by reference into this rule: This rulemaking adds several provisions to the 2012 Internation al Residential Code (IRC) in the form of a new appendix addressing certain aspects of \"Tiny Homes.\" This rulem aking also add an amendment to the 2015 International Building Code (IBC) that will place a limit on th e required length of reinforcement lap splices for allowable stress design (ASD) of masonry.

The action is authori zed pursuant to Section 67-2601A, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, o r an agency, not later than September 20, 2017. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabili ties. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior t o the hearing, to the agency ad dress below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Many of the statutory references, as well as certain provisions related to other programs and authorities in the current rules are very outdated, and do not apply. Additionally , statutory authority to administer the safety program for state facilities was transferred solely to the Division in 2015. Accordingly, other applicable rules related to the inspections thereof, which were previously administered by the Idaho Industrial Commission, have been updated. This rule amends outdated statutory provisions, and updates the adopted safety standards applicable to the safety inspections the Division conducts on state-owned buildings, or those it may conduct for a political subdivision. It also eliminates unnecessary references to programs that are no longe r administered through this particular Division safety program such as elevators and boilers. Finally, the rulemaking updates certain requirements for public employers to ensure a safe workplace, as well as the annual inspection proce ss the Division currently engages in when inspecting state facilities. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was conducted.

The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 54-5001 and 54-5005, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, o r an agency, not later than September 20, 2017.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The current edition of the International Residential Code requi res mechanical ventilation and details how to design the systems to achieve the required flowrate of air as e xpressed in cubic feet per minute (CFM). This is based on the number of bedrooms and square footage of the dwelling. T he existing administrative rule provision does not improve or help administer this requirement beyond that which i s already contained in the code itself. Accordingly, the code amendment in the rules is not needed. This rulemaking deletes an amendment to a mechanical provision (section M1502.4.2) of the International Residential Code relat ed to System Design that is no longer necessary. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/ANEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was not conducted because the rule is simple in nature. The Internation al Residential Code (IRC) currently adopted for the State of Idaho already contains provisions related to designing mechanical systems to achieve the required flowrate of air in residences. This rulemakin g merely deletes an unnecessar y amendment to the IRC that is already adequately covered elsewhere therein. Add itionally, the proposed rulemakin g was discussed at several HV AC board meetings over the course of the last year, without opposition from mecha nical contractors or the public. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following i s a brief synopsis of why the materials cited are being incorporated by reference into this rule: This rulemaking deletes an amendment to a mechanical provision (section M1502.4.2) of the International Residential Code related to Syst em Design that is no longer nec essary.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Section 54-5021, Idaho Code, requires that HV AC inspectors are to be appropriately certified for the type of HV AC work that they are inspecting in accordance with administr ative rule. This rulemaking identifies two entities currently available that certify mechanical inspectors, and all ows the HV AC Board the flexibility to approve any other professional certifying body. This rule specifies that all mechanical inspectors in Idaho emp loyed by the state or a local government shall hold an inspector certification as either a commercial or residentia l mechanical inspector, as required depending on the type of mechanical work being inspected. It also provides that mechanical inspectors shall obtain such certification from the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical O fficials (IAPMO), the International Code Council (ICC), or another professional certifying body as approved by t he HVAC Board. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/ANEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was not conducted because the rule is sim ple in nature. Idaho Code requ ires that HV AC inspectors be certified as commercial or residential mechanical inspectors. The large majority of mec hanical inspectors with the Division and local jurisdictions attain certification through two organizations - International Code Council (ICC), and the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO). This rulemaking would only establish in rule what is largely occurring already among mechanical inspectors. Addition ally, the proposed rulemaking was discussed at numerous HV AC board meetings over the course of several years, without opposition from mechanical inspectors or the public.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code , notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a temporary rule, and proposed rulemaking pr ocedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Sections 55-2203, 55-2208 and 55-2211, I daho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, o r an agency, not later than September 20, 2017. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabili ties. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior t o the hearing, to the agency ad dress below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: During the 2016 session, the Idaho Legislature established the Damage Prevention Board and amended the statutory scheme in Title 55, Chapter 22, Idaho Code, related t o the prevention of damage of underground facilities throughout the state. Several statutory sections within Title 5 5, Chapter 22, Idaho Code, require the Board to adopt rules governing various aspects of the Board's authority to reg ulate safe practices, and the conduct of those involved in the industry in order to prevent damage to underground facil ities. These statutory Sections include 55-2203, 55- 2208 and 55-2211. The rules required pursuant to these statutes relate to the adoption of training programs, improving technology and facility owners' internal performance measures, the adoption of processes for filing claims and complaints related to damaged f acilities and excavator downtime , and the establishment of civil penalties for violations of the Damage Prevention Board statutes and rules. This rulemaking provides several definitions of key terms inclu ding \"hand digging\" and \"soft digging;\" it establishes the adoption process and accessibility of education al and training materials for use by stakeholders; as well as processes for the review of the adequacy of facility ow ners' ability to locate their facilities, and reviewing technology to improve communication and locating capabilities. The rulemaking also establishes procedural requirements for filing complaints and claims related to underg round facility damage or excavator downtime. Finally, it establishes the civil penalties that may be imposed for cert ain violations of the statutes and rules. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(b), Idaho Code, the Governor ha s found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the foll owing reasons: The 2016 Legislature amended Title 55, Chapter 22, Idaho Code r elated to the prevention of damage to underground facilities throughout the state. Several statutory sections within Title 55, Chapter 22, Idaho Code, require the Board to adopt rules governing various aspects of t he industry to ensure safe practices and the protection of underground facilities. Because the statutes require much of the detail about administering the program to be set forth in rule, it is difficult for the Board to actually implem ent an effective damage prevention program. Additionally, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHM SA) within the U.S. Department of Transportation conducts an annual evaluation of the State's excavation and underground damage prevention program to determine if it meets federal req uirements. In 2016, PHMSA found that the State of Idaho's program was inad equate largely due to the State's inability to enforce safe practices related to the protection of underground facilities, including the imposition of penalties and other sanctions. Establishing the authorities and policies prov ided in this rulemaking will be a critical step toward obtaining approval from PHMSA when it performs its 2017 evaluat ion of the State's program. In the absence of a state-approved program, PHMSA ex ercises jurisdiction over all p ipelines and hazardous materials facilities, which is not preferred by those within the industry.DIVISION OF BUILDING SAFETY Docket No. 07-1001-1701 Rules Governing the Damage Prevention Board Temporary & Proposed Rule Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 80 September 6, 2017 - Vol. 17 -9FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: There will be no fiscal impact t o the state General Fund. It is expected that there will be a positive impact on the Damage Prevention Board dedicated fund as civil penalties are c ollected; however that may be offset by a negative impact to the Division as a result of the need to perform inves tigative activities in response to complaints received. Civil penalties will only adversely affect those stakeholders w ho do not comply with legal requirements. A positive and necessary economic result will be the reduction of underground facility damages throughout the State of Idaho, as well as reinforcement of public safety through the protection o f life and property. The fiscal impact to the various stakeholders providing such assurance may be significant - up t o hundreds of thousands of dollars spent in some cases on additional staffing and supporting resources to effectively reduce damage to underground facilities. Such expenses to facilities owners are expected to be offset by the reduction of actual damages when the damage prevention program begins to operate effectively. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was conducted. The Notice of Intent to Promulgate Rules - Negotiate d Rulemaking was published in the March 1, 2017 Idaho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 17-3, pages 20 through 21 .

The action is authori zed pursuant to Sections 39-605, 39-906, 39-1603, 39-4502, 56-1005, SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, o r an agency, not later than September 20, 2017. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabili ties. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior t o the hearing, to the agency ad dress below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Most of the larger hospitals in Idaho perform universal Critica l Congenital Heart Defect (CCHD) screening as part of the newborn screening panel. However, some of the small er, more rural hospitals and birthing centers do not. Idaho is the only state that does not have rules that cover the requirements for CCHD screening. This rule change adds CCHD to the uniform screening panel for all newborns in Id aho. Congenital heart defects are the most common birth defect and impact approximately 8 out of every 1,000 infa nts born. Of these, approximately 25% (2.4 per 1,000) are considered critical and require immediate detection and int ervention. In Idaho, it is estimated that approximately 55 infants are born each year with CCHD. The goal of CCHD scree ning is to identify and treat newborns with structural heart defects utilizin g a simple, cost-effective, and noninvasive screening test where oxygen saturation is assessed after the first 24 hours of life. Without this intervention, the rates of mortality and survival with significant disability are extremely high among infants with CCHD. This proposed rule change adds CCHD as a required screening and mandates that all newborns receive a CCHD screening shortly after birth. If the proposed rules are approv ed, the Department will add CCHD screening information to their birth certificate system in Vital Records. This would allow the Idaho Newborn Screening Program to monitor screening compliance and provide assistance to families including referrals for follow-up care on positive screens.FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year as a result of this rulemaking: An annual ongoing cost of $20,000 in general funds is projected for the Department to cover operating costs for pediatric cardiologist consultation, provider training, purchas e of tool kits, and development of other educational materials. Staff time and other operating costs to implement th e rules, such as the changes to the birth certificate system, will be covered annually under federal funds through th e Department's Maternal and Child Health Program. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was not conducted because informal stakeholder meetings are being condu cted in a shorter time frame. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the Critical CH D Screening Methods by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven tion, from \"Strategies of Implementing Screening for Critical Congenital Heart Diseases,\" Kemper, et al., 2011, is b eing incorporated by reference into these rules to give it the force and effect of law.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: These rule changes are being made to: meet court-ordered settle ment agreements for expedited hearings and grievance processes for the Jeff D settlement agreement, comply with federal regulations, and provide benefits to consumers to use technological advances for filing of appeals f or certain divisions, and to provide other needed internal appeals processes for divisional administrative review s. Several changes are being made to remove and update obsolete language.FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year as a result of this rulemaking: There is no anticipated fiscal impact to the State General Fund or any other funds for this rule change. This rulemaking is intended to be cost-neutral.NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was not conducted.

The Legal Authority section of these rules is being updated for statutes necessary for this requirement. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year as a result of this rulemaking: There is no anticipated fiscal impact to the State General Fund or any other funds for this rule change. This rulemaking is intended to be cost-neutral. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was not conducted. The Department determined it was not feasible to do negotiated rulemaking as this rule change adds reference language for the Behavioral Health waiver process for peers providing Recovery Support Services when a criminal history clearance is denied. Providers and affected parties have requested the Department reinstate this process that was previously available.INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: No materials are being incorporated by reference into these ru les.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Idaho Code Section 41-2502 requires that insurers offer uninsur ed and underinsured auto coverage to Idaho consumers and also provides that a consumer can reject such cov erage in writing when the p olicy is first purchased. Subsection (3) of this section also provides that the insurer p rovide a statement approved by the Director of the Department of Insurance explaining both types of coverage and t he types of underinsured coverage that might be available in Idaho. The department fulfilled this directive ini tially by publishing Bulletin 08-08. Recently there has been discussion about whether consumers are adequately protecte d under the status quo. In 2017, there were three bills (H0163, S1048, and S1078) that considered proposing amend ments to Idaho Code Sections 41-2502 or 41-2503 (the latter section containing definitions). Legislators sugges ted that the Director meet with industry to consider alternatives that might better serve Idahoans. Pursuant to negotiated rulemaking, a public meeting was held and written comments were received resulting in this proposed rule. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was conducted.

For the purpose of this Rule, the term \"the Act\" shall, unles s otherwise 41-2508, 41-2509, 41-2510, 41-2511, 41-2512 of the Idaho otherwise known as the Insurance Code.

The provisions of Section 41-2506(1)(d), Definitions - Non-Pa yment of Premium, shall be interpreted as follows: Non-Payment of Pre mium shall mean the failure of the named insured, or his legal representative, to discharge when due any of his obligations in connection with the payment of any premiums or installment premiums on a policy as defined in the Act, or any membership fees due an association or organization, other than an insurance association or organizati on, which by its by-laws requires the payment of such membership fees by the member prior to his obtaining or continu ing insurance in force through such an association or organization. The term \"non-payment of premium\" as referred to in the Act shall also apply when the named insured or his legal representative is obligated to pay such premium or membership fee directly to the insurer, its agent or representative, or indirectly under any premium finance plan or extensions of credit. However, if the agent or other representative of the insurer extends credit to the insured, or ally or otherwise, and said agent or representative terminates such credit arrangement with the insured because of non-payment, said agent or representative, with the knowledge and consent of the insurer, shall then mail or delive r, or cause to be mailed or delivered, to the named insured or his legal representative written notice of cancellat ion which states, in effect, that the insurance provided by the policy upon which such credit was granted shall cease on a given time and date. This time and date shall be no earlier than ten (10) days after the date such notice was maile d or delivered, the date of mailing considered to be the first day and the tenth day being considered to be ended at mid night, standard time, at the last known address of the named insured. Nothing in this rule shall be construed to permi t any agent or other representative of the insurer to cancel any policy without the concurrence of the insurer or for any private debt between the agent and the insured. Also, nothing in the section shall be construed to prohibit a p olicy from being canceled effective as of any date that is mutually acceptable to the insured, the insurer and the lienhol der, if any. Furthermore, a prior existing policy shall terminate on the effective date of any other policy procured by the insured with respect to any automobile designated in both policies and containing duplicate insurance coverage. (7-1-93) 043. Sixty Day Period . The sixty (60) day period referred to in Subsection (2) of Se ction 41-2506, CANCELLATION OF POLICIES - DEFINITIONS, is intended to provide to insurers a reasonable period of time, if desired, to thoroughly investigate a particular risk while exte nding coverage during the period of investigation.

For the purpose of this rule, the term \"inception d ate\" shall mean that date and time that the policy goes into effect and the protection furnished by the policy commence s.

These coverages can protect you and your passengers by paying damages, up to the UM/UIM policy limits you have cho- sen, when an at-fault person does not have any or enough liability coverage. xUM coverage may pay damages for bodily injuries caused by an at-fault motorist who has no insurance, or from a hit-and-run vehicle where the at-fault party is unknown. xUIM coverage may pay damages for bodily injuries if the at-fault motorist does not have enough liability insur- ance to cover your costs. UIM coverage is offered in different types by different insurers, and insurers are not required to offer more than one type of UIM coverage. The most common available type of UIM coverage is \"Difference in Limits\" (or \"Offset\") Coverage. Some insurers may offer \"Excess\" Coverage. Please refer to the attached examples to see how the different types of UIM coverage may impact your level of protection. You have the option to purchase both UIM and UM coverage in varying amounts at or above the minimum liability re-quirements in Idaho, which are $25,000 per person, $50,000 for two or more persons in any one accident. By signing below, you acknowledge that the insurance company has explained the following UM/UIM coverages that are available as part of your policy: Insurer: UIM Type: Difference in Limits (Offset) x I have read the above explanation of Uninsured Motorist and Underinsured Motorist coverages.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: This rule provides specifics for the plan design of five indivi dual health plans to be offered through the Idaho Individual High Risk Reinsurance Pool (Pool), per Chapter 55, T itle 41, Idaho Code. Revisions to Chapter 55, effective July 1, 2017, have eliminated the requirement and the need to design specific products for the Pool, which, going forward, will likely function as a reinsurance mechanism for individuals with certain health conditions enrolled in major medical individual health insurance plans available ma rket-wide. IDAPA 18.01.73 is no longer necessary for the effectuation of Title 41, Idaho Code as Chapter 55, Title 4 1, Idaho Code, no longer provides for individuals to be enrolled in unique high risk pool plans. The approximately 50 individuals grandfathered into these plans prior to the 2017 legislation will be renewed into these plans, if they desi re, without modification to plan design. Therefore, rules for design of these plans are obsolete as no new such plans wil l be created. This rulemaking proposes to repeal this rule.FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(1), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was conducted.

The action is authori zed pursuant to Sections 63-105(2), 63-3624(a), 63- 3635, and 63-3039, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerning this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, o r an agency, not later than September 27, 2017. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabili ties. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior t o the hearing, to the agency ad dress below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance a nd purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Rule 013 - Road And Paving Contractors. We are proposing to add some examples to this rule to clarify when taxes are owed. Rule 044 - Trade-ins, Trade-downs And Barter . W e are proposing to change this rule to conform to 2017, HB 156. The main change is to replace park trailer with park model recreational vehicle. This rule is also amended to include a reference to Rule 35.01.02.048 regarding how to treat trade-ins of Park Model Recreational Vehicles. Some technical and grammar changes are also proposed. Rule 048 - Manufactured Homes (Mobile Homes) And Modular Buildi ngs. We are proposing to change to conform to 2017, HB 156. The changes are to replace park traile r with park model recreational vehicle. This change will add a new paragraph to define New Park Model Recreational Vehicles and clearly state that these are taxed at 100% of the sales price. The way in which used Park Model Recre ational Vehicles are taxed will also be addressed. This rule is also being amended to reflect how trade-ins are to be treated. Some technical and grammar changes are also proposed. Rule 061 - Transportation, Freight, And Handling Charges. We ar e proposing to change this rule to conform to the 2017, HB 156. In the negotiated process we discussed what c hanges were necessary. Since HB 156 modified code section 63-3613 to specifically include those costs in a Park M odel Recreational Vehicle, no changes were needed within the rule. The statute reference was added to the title. Some technical and grammar changes are also proposed. Rule 079 - Production Exemption. We are proposing to change thi s rule to conform to the 2017, HB 156. HB 156 added Park Model Recreational Vehicles to 63-3622HH(4) as a typ e of vehicle that is not eligible for the production exemption. Rule 35.01.02.079.05.m. and 05.n. are being modified to reflect this treatment for Park Model Recreational Vehicles. Some tech nical and grammar changes are a lso proposed. Rule 099 - Occasional Sales. We are proposing to change this ru le to conform to 2017, HB 156. Rule 35.01.02.099.09 lists items that do not qualify for the occasio nal sales exemption and are therefore always taxable. Park Model Recreational Vehicles is being added to that list. S ome technical and grammar changes are also proposed. Rule 107 - Vehicles And Vessels - Gifts, Military Personnel, No nresident, New Resident, Tax Paid To Another State, Sales To Family Members, Sales To American Indians, And Other Exemptions: It was decided in the negotiated rule-making process that referencing the statutes wo uld be the only necessary change to meet the requirements of 2017, HB156 regarding the Park Model RV statute . This rule is also being changed to reflect the law change allowing the nonresident use of a vehicle in Idaho from 60 to 90 days. Some technical and grammar changes are also proposed. Rule 128 - Certificates For Resales And Other Exemption Claims. We are proposing to change this rule to conform to the 2017, HB 156. Park Model Recreational Vehicles will be added to the list of nonexempt items under the production exemption in Rule 35.01.02.128.07. Some technica l and grammar changes are also proposed.STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-1702 Idaho Sales & Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 252 September 6, 2017 - Vol. 1 7-9FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year resulting from this rulemaking: N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was conducted.

Box 36, Boise, ID 83722-0410Phone: (208) 334-7531 / Fax: (208) 334-7846 THE FOLLOWING IS THE PROPOSED TEXT OF DOCKET NO. 35-0102-1702 (Only Those Sections With Amendments Are Shown.) 013. ROAD AND PAVING CONTRACTORS (RULE 013). Sections 63-3609 & 63-3615, Idaho Code 01. In General . This rule illustrates the application of Idaho sales and use tax to specific activities of road and paving contractors. The general principles stated in R ule 012 of these rules apply equally to road and paving contractors. (7-1-96) 02. Road or Paving Contractor . A road or paving contractor is a contractor improving real property. The use of materials over which he exercises right or power in the course of performing the contract is subject to tax. This is true even if an exempt entity, such as a government age ncy, owns the material. It is also true if the contractor does the work under the full or partial supervision of the pers on for whom the contractor is performing the contract. (7-1-96) ( ) 03. Examples . Here are some examples of taxable materials contractors use i n paving and road contracts: ( ) a. Example 1: A contractor is hired to pave a road for a city. The materials the contractor will use are taxable, regardless of ownership, and include rock, sand, asphalt oil, chemicals, bonding agents, or any other like materials which become the aggregate pavement. ( ) b. Example 2: A contractor is hired to chip seal a local road. The chip seal includes a layer of liquid asphalt or similar material applied to the road with an immedia te layer of rock chips applied on top of the wet asphalt. STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-1702 Idaho Sales & Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 253 September 6, 2017 - Vol. 1 7-9A roller sets the rock chips in place. Once this dries, the sur face is cleaned and another oil seal or like product is applied. These three items and any other materials used to form the aggregate chip seal are subject to tax. ( ) c. Example 3: A contractor is hired to perform landscaping for the barrow pits and shoulders of a new highway. The highway district provides the grass seed and some bushes for the project. The contractor provides labor to sow the seed, plant the bushes, and labor and materials to p rovide erosion control, land leveling, contouring, etc. The contractor owes sales or use tax on all materials consumed, including those provided by the highway district. ( ) d. Example 4: A contractor is hired to install a new bridge and pr ovide drainage for a new freeway interchange. The highway district provides the bridge component s and culverts needed for the project, and the contractor provided all of the remaining materials and the labo r for the project. The contractor will owe sales or use tax on all materials he consumes including the bridge component s and culverts provided by the highway district, as well as on the materials the contractor purchased for use on th e project. ( ) e. Example 5: A contractor is hired to install traffic control lig hts, signage, and roadway illumination for a rebuilt section of roadway. The highway district provides the traffic control signals and the permanent signage for the highway so that all signage will be consistent througho ut the highway district. The contractor owes use tax on the value of the traffic signals and signage provided by the hi ghway district as well as on the cost of electrical wiring, signal wiring, and the lights and light poles, etc., purchased and consumed by the contractor. ( ) 034. Materials . The sale or use of materials which are extracted and crushed is taxable. Use tax does not apply to the use of natural materials that are secured on site and used without significant change. (7-1-96) 045. Rock Crushing . The application of the sales or use tax to rock crushing oper ations depends upon the circumstances of the case. (7-1-96) a. A sale of crushing only is a sale of a taxable processing servi ce. In this circumstance the crusher obtains raw material owned by another, crushes the rock, and stockpiles it for subsequent use either by the owner or a third party. Unless an exemption applies, the crusher must char ge tax on all such sales. (7-1-96) b. A contractor who applies crushed rock to the highway pursuant t o a contract is a person engaged in improving real property. If the contractor applying the crushed rock purchases the rock, the purchase price will be subject to a sales or use tax. If the contractor applies rock o wned by another party, the contractor will be responsible for a use tax on the value of the rock, unless the other party paid a sales tax upon its acquisition. This is true even if a government agency supplied the rock. If a recent retail acquisition of the crushed rock exists, the retail price shall be presumed to be the value of the material. If a recent retail sa les price does not exist, then value shall be determined by the current acquisition cost of like material from the same or a similar source. For purposes of this section, a retail acquisition within one (1) year of the time of the performance of the contract shall be presumed to be a recent sales price. (7-1-96) c. A contractor whose contract calls for him to both crush and app ly rock to a road is also subject to sales or use tax on the value of the rock whether the contract is performed for a governmental or private contractee. The value shall be determined by the royalty or similar charge for raw materials. If a royalty or similar charge does not exist, then the value will be determined as the royalty fee or value of like material from a similar source. If the contractor chooses to have the rock crushed by a subcontractor, the measure of the use tax is on the crushed value. (7-1-96) d. A sale of rock crushing services to a retailer who will sell th e rock is an exempt sale. The sale of crushed rock to a consumer is a taxable sale unless an exemption applies. (7-1-96) 056. Production Exemption . (7-1-96) a. Since a contractor improving real property is defined as the co nsumer of materials incorporated into realty, he is not producing an article for resale. Therefo re, the production exemption does not apply to the use of equipment used by contractors to produce asphalt or concrete wh ich are used to complete paving contracts. (7-1-96)STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-1702 Idaho Sales & Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 254 September 6, 2017 - Vol. 1 7-9b. A business which is primarily devoted to producing crushed rock , asphalt, or concrete which is ultimately sold at retail will qualify for the production exemp tion. See Idaho Administrative Sales Tax Rules 079 and 082. (7-1-96) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 044. TRADE-INS, TRADE-DOWNS AND BARTER (RULE 044). Section 63-3613, Idaho Code 01. Trade-Ins . A trade-in is the amount allowed by a retailer on merchandise accepted as payment for other merchandise. Merchandise is tangible personal property wh ich is, or becomes, part of an inventory held for resale. (7-1-93) 02. Trade-In Allowance . When a retailer sells merchandise from his resale inventory a nd lets the customer trade in other goods which the retailer places in his resale inventory, the taxable sales price of the merchandise may be reduced by the amount allowed as trade-in. T o qualify for the trade-in allowance, the property traded in must be consideration delivered by the buyer to the s eller. The sales documents, executed not later than the time of sale, must identify the tangible personal property being purchased and the trade-in property being delivered to the seller. The delivery of the trade-in and the purchase must be components of a single transaction. (4-4-13) a. Example: A customer buys a car fro m a dealer for four thousand dollars ($4,000). A trade-in of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) is allowed for the custo mer's used car. Tax is charged on two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500). (4-4-13) 03. Trade-Downs . A trade-down is a transaction in which a vendor accepts a tra de-in from the customer that equals or exceeds the value of the merchandise so ld to the customer. The taxable sales price is reduced to zero (0) and no sales tax is due on the transaction. (4-4-13) 04. Disallowed Trade-In Deductions Allowances . ( ) a. Private Party Transactions . A Ttrade-in deductions are allowance is not allowed on transactions between individuals because the t rade-in property does not beco me a part of an inventory held for resale. (3-30-01) ( ) a.i. Example: Two (2) individuals exch ange cars of equal value. No m oney, property, service, or consideration other than the cars are exchanged. Both parties m ust pay tax on the fair market value of the vehicle received in the barter. (7-1-93) b.ii. Example: Two (2) individuals, ne ither of whom are car dealers, exchange cars of different values. Tom's vehicle, which is worth ten thousand dollars ($10,000), i s transferred to Bill. Bill's car, which is worth eight thousand dollars ($8,000), is transferred to Tom. Bill pays Tom two thousand dollars ($2,000). The trade-in allowance is not applicable because neither car is merchandise. Tom pays use tax on eight thousand dollars ($8,000); Bill pays use tax on ten thousand dollars ($10,000). (7-1-93) b. Manufactured Homes (Mobile Homes), New Park Model Recreational Vehicles, and Modular B uilding s. T rade- in allowances are n ot allowed o n the sale o f m anufactured homes, new park model recreational vehicles, and modular buildings. See IDAPA 35.01.02.048 of thes e rules. ( ) 05. Insurance Settlements . An insurance settlement does not qualify as a trade-in. Examp le: Tom is involved in a car accident. His in surance company determines th e damage exceeds the value of the car and settles with Tom on that basis. If Tom buys another car, he must pay sa les tax on the entire sales price of the replacement car. (3-30-01) 06. Core Charges . Parts for cars, trucks, and other types of equipment are ofte n sold with an added core charge. When the used core is returned, the core charge is refunded. This is essentially a trade-in of a used part STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-1702 Idaho Sales & Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 255 September 6, 2017 - Vol. 1 7-9for a new part. Since the seller cannot be certain that the cus tomer will return a reusable core, such core charges are subject to sales tax. The tax on the core charge will be refund ed by the seller at the time credit for the core charge is allowed. (7-1-93) 07. Trade-In for Rental/Lease Property . When tangible personal property is traded in as part payment for the rental or lease of other tangible personal prop erty, sales tax applies to all payments made after the value of the trade-in property has been depleted and the lessor actually begins charging for the lease or rental. The methods of applying the trade-in v alue to the lease are: (7-1-93 ) a. The trade-in value may be subtracted from the value of the leas ed or rented property, thereby reducing the monthly payments and the sales tax due on those pa yments. (7-1-93) b. The trade-in value may be subtracted from the initial lease pay ments, with no sales tax due on those payments until it is used up. (7-1-93) c. A combination of the two (2) methods, above. (7-1-93) d. Example, a lessor leases a car for thirty-six (36) months at tw o hundred fifty dollars ($250) per month. The value on which the lease payments are based is ten t housand dollars ($10,000). The customer trades in a car worth two thousand dollars ($2,000). (3-30-01) i. Alternative 1: The customer and lessor agree to reduce the va lue on which the lease is based by two thousand dollars ($2,000) and reduce the payments to only two h undred dollars ($200) per month for thirty-six (36) months. Sales tax is due on each two hundred dollar ($200) paym ent. (3-30-01) ii. Alternative 2: The customer and lessor agree to apply the tw o thousand dollar ($2,000) trade-in allowance against the two hundred fifty dollar ($250) per month payments for the first eight (8) months of the lease. Sales tax is not due until the trade-in value is used up and th e lessee is required to begin making monthly payments. (3-30-01) iii. Alternative 3: The customer and lessor agree to combine the two methods and apply one thousand dollars ($1,000) against the value on which the lease is based and use the remaining one thousand dollars ($1,000) against the monthly payments, reducing the sales tax liability accordingly. (3-30-01) 08. Rental/Lease Property Traded-In . When a person disposes of tangible personal property that is leased and assigns his right to purchase the leased property to the retailer, no trade-in allowance is given for the amount of the residual buyout paid by the retailer. However, if the residual buyout amount which the lessee would pay to purchase the property is less than the amount that would be allowed by the retailer as a trade-in if the lessee had actually owned the vehicle, then the sales price subject to tax may be reduced by the difference between the total trade-in amount and residual buyout. (3-30-01) a. Example: A person is the lessee of an automobile. Near the end of the lease term, the lessee enters into an agreement to purchase a new vehicle from an automobile dealer. The residual buyout amount for the leased vehicle is ten thousand dollars ($10,000). The retailer would a llow nine thousand dollars ($9,000) as a trade-in amount if the lessee actually own ed the vehicle. Since the amou nt the automobile dealer is willing to allow as a trade- in is not greater than the residual buyout amount, there is no reduction in the sales price subject to sales tax. (3-30-01) b. Example: A lessee trades in his leased automobile for a new veh icle. The residual amount is ten thousand dollars ($10,000). The automobile dealer allows twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) as a trade. In this case, the sales price of the new vehicle is reduced by the difference between the residual amount and the total trade-in, or two thousand dollars ($2,000).

Example 2: A mother sells her automobile to her son for five th ousand dollars ($5,000). The mother is an Oregon resident and did not pay a sales or use tax when she purchased the automobile. The son, who is a resident of Idaho, must pay Idaho use tax on the five thousand dollar ($5,000) purchase price of the automobile. (7-1-93) 05. Transfers Between Related Parties . The transfer of capital assets between related parties qualif ies for an occasional sale exemption, but only if the person transf erring the asset has paid a sales or use tax when the asset was acquired. Exempt transfers between related parties in clude: capital assets transferred in and out of businesses by owners, partners, shareholders stockholders, when the transfer is made only in exchange for equity in the business, and capital assets t ransferred between a parent c orporation and its subsidiary, if the parent owns at least eighty percent (80%) of the subsidiary, and transfers between s ubsidiary corporations with a common parent, if the parent owns at least eighty percent (80%) of both, and if the t ransfers are made only in exchange for stock or securities. (4-11-06) a. Example: Two (2) individuals form a partnership. Each contribut es a car in exchange for a percentage of ownership in the business. If each partner paid s ales tax when he purchased his vehicle, no sales tax applies to the transfer of the vehicle into the partnership. (7-1-97) b. Example: Three (3) individuals are equal partners in a construc tion business. They dissolve the partnership, and each person takes one-third (1/3) of the capit al assets as his share of the equity in the business. If tax was paid on the assets when they were purchased by the partners hip, sales tax does not apply to the transfer of the assets from the partnership to the co-owners. (7-1-93) c. Example: A corporation-owned car is given to a shareholder as a bonus for special accomplishments. There is no chan ge in the recipient's sharehol dings. The shareholder must pay tax on the bonus based on the value of the car, regardless of whether the corpor ation paid tax when the car was purchased. The exemption does not apply because the transfer of the car did no t change the shareholder's equity. (7-1-93) 06. Sales and Rentals to Related Parties . The sale of a capital asset to a related party qualifies for the occasional sale exemption, but only if the seller has paid sale s or use tax when the asset was acquired or if the seller acquired the asset from a related party who paid sales tax on a cquisition of the asset. Rentals and leases of capital assets between related parties will also qualify for the occasi onal sale exemption, but only if the initial related party paid sales tax upon acquisition of the asset. If the initial pu rchaser does not pay sales or use tax upon the purchase of a capital asset and then leases the asset to a related party, t he lessor must collect and remit sales tax on the lease payments. The lease payments must also represent a reasonable r ental value for the asset. Exempt transactions between related parties include sales, rentals, and leases of c apital assets other than aircraft, boats and vessels, snowmobiles, off-highway motorbikes, and recreational vehicles, as defined by Section, 63-3622HH, Idaho Code, such as the following: (4-11-06) a. Sales to family members, but only if all parties to the sale ar e related within the second degree of consanguinity, relationship by blood, or affinity, relationship by marriage, i.e., spouses, children, parents, brothers, sisters, or grandparents. Example: A father and son are the sto ckholders of Corporation A. This corporation sells a business asset to Proprietorship B, which is owned by the son's grandfather. This sale is exempt as long as Corporation A paid sales tax when the asset was acquired. (7-1-9 8) b. Sales in which the new owners are identical to the prior owners . Example: Corporation B owns one hundred percent (100%) of Corporation A. If the initial purchas er paid tax when it acquired an asset, it may sell the asset to the other without tax. Example: John Doe owns one hund red percent (100%) of a corporation. He buys a truck and pays sales tax. He later sells the truck to his corpo ration. No tax applies to the sale of the truck to the corporation. Example: A and B each own fifty percent (50%) of a partnership. The partnership buys a capital asset and pays sales tax to the vendor. The partnership immediately l eases the asset to Corporation C. A owns ten percent (10%) of Corporation C and B owns ninety percent (90%) of Corpo ration C. Since the percentages of ownership of the partnership and the corpora tion are not identical, the leas e transaction does not qualify for the occasional sale exemption. The partnership must seek a refund of the sales tax paid on acquisition of the asset and collect and remit sales tax on the lease payments.

(4-11-15) b. Military personnel receive no special exemption from the Idaho sales and use tax regarding motor vehicles or other tangible personal property purchased while te mporarily assigned in this state.

When a general retail sales tax has been properly imposed by another state or political subdivision of a state of the United States in an amount equal to or greater than the amount due Idaho, no Idaho tax is due. The credit for state and local taxe s paid in another state will be applied first to the state sales tax due and the remainder, if any, will be applied to any local taxes due. (3-30-07) a. If the amount paid to the other state is less, Idaho tax is due to the extent of the difference, unless some other exemption applies.

A registration certificate or title issued by another taxing state is sufficient evidence that t ax was imposed at the other state's tax rate. (7-1-93) b. Example: A resident of another state buys a vehicle in that sta te for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) two (2) months before moving to Idaho. He presents his title fr om the other state to an Idaho county assessor. Since he acquired the vehicle only two (2) months before entering Ida ho, no exemption applies. The tax paid to the other state was three hundred dollars ($300) when the vehicle was pur chased. Credit for this amount is allowed against the six hundred dollars ($600) tax due Idaho. The assessor will col lect three hundred dollars ($300) tax.

The applicant paid four percent (4%) state sales tax, one and s ix tenths percent (1.6%) city sales tax, and one and six tenths percent (1.6%) county sales tax. The total general sales tax paid was seven and two tenths percent (7.2%). Since the Idaho tax rate is lower, no tax is due Idaho because the amount of tax paid to t he other state exceeds the amount owed Idaho. (4-2-08) d. Example: A resident of Alaska purchases a vehicle immediately p rior to moving to Idaho. The purchaser paid a three percent (3%) city sales tax in Alaska. W hen the purchaser moves to Idaho, credit will be given for the local tax paid against th e Idaho state use tax due. (3-30-07) e. A registration certificate or title issued by another taxing st ate is proof that tax was paid to the other taxing state. This does not apply to states that do not have a tax, such as Montana and Oregon, or when a state has exempted the motor vehicle from tax. (7-1-93) f. Example: A church buys and titles a vehicle in Utah. The Utah s ales tax law exempts the purchase of the vehicle from sales tax. The church later titles the vehi cle in Idaho. Sales tax must be paid on the fair market value of the vehicle when it is titled in Idaho. (7-1-93) g. Taxes paid to another nation cannot be offset against the taxes owed to Idaho. (7-1-93) 07.

(7-1-93) a. The Sales Tax Exemption Certificate-Transfer Affidavit, Form ST -133, is used to document this exemption. The seller and buyer must complete and sign Form ST- 133 and submit it to the Idaho Transportation Department or county assessor along with the title to the vehic le being transferred. If the seller is unable to sign the affidavit a letter from the seller stating the sale was made to a qualified family member may be accepted by the county assessor or his representa tive and attached to the affid avit. (2-18-02) b. This exemption does not apply if the seller did not pay tax whe n he acquired the vehicle. (7-1-93) c. Example: An Oregon resident buys a vehicle and titles it in Ore gon without paying sales or use tax. Later, he sells the vehicle for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) to his son who is an Idaho resident. No exemption applies, since the father did not pay a sales or use tax when h e acquired the vehicle.

(3-4-10)STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-1702 Idaho Sales & Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 270 September 6, 2017 - Vol. 1 7-906. Seller's Responsibility -- Purchases for Resale . A seller is not liable for the collection of sales tax on items sold to a customer from whom the seller has obtained a properly executed Sales Tax Resale and Exemption Certificate, Form ST-101, if the customer intends to resell the items in the regular course of business. The seller has no duty or obligation to collect sales or use taxes in regard t o any sales transaction so documented unless the sale fits into the narrow classification of sales that can be considered to be taxable as a matter of law in the particular instance claimed on the resale certificate. If the particular item being purchased for resale does not commonly match the description of the general character of the tangible personal p roperty as identified on the resale certificate, then it is presumed that the sale is taxable as a matter of law; however, if the seller questions the purchaser and the purchaser provides a new certificate specifically identifying the propert y in question as being purchased for resale, then the seller can accept the certificate and is relieved of any furthe r responsibility. (3-4-10) a. Example: A restaurant operator completes an ST-101 for his supp lier. He indicates the general character of the products he sells as food and beverages. The r estaurant operator purchases sugar and flour from the supplier. The supplier is not liable for the collection of the sales tax as the character of the goods is that which the restaurant operator will resell in the regular course of busine ss. The resale claim made by the restaurant operator is available as a matter of law. (3-6-00) b. Example: The same restaurant operator later purchases dish towe ls and dish washing soap. The supplier must collect the tax. The general character of the goo ds are not those sold by a restaurant in the normal course of business. The exemption claimed by the restaurant is not available as a matter of law. However, if the restaurant operator identifies cleaning supplies as one of the types of items it resells, either on the original certificate or on a new certificate, then the supplier need not collect the tax. (3-4-10) c. Example: An appliance store buys appliances and some furniture for resale from a supplier. The appliance store has a resale certificate on file with the suppl ier. The supplier also sells warehouse equipment as part of its business. The appliance store buys a forklift from the supp lier. The supplier should charge tax. However, if the furniture store provides a new certificate indicating it will s ell the forklift, the supplier has no duty or obligation to collect the tax. Without the new certificate, an objectively re asonable person would not assume a furniture store sells forklifts. Additionally, the furniture store is only buying one (1) forklift and this fact indicates to the supplier that it i s not buying the forklift for resale. (3-4-10) 07. Seller's Responsibility -- Purchases Claimed Exempt from Sal es Tax for Reasons Other Than Resale . A seller is not liable for the collection of sales tax on ite ms sold to a customer from whom a properly executed Sales Tax Resale and Exemption Certificate, Form ST-10 1, has been received if the nature of the exemption claimed is available to the purchaser as a matter of law or the nature of the goods purchased qualify for the particular exemption claimed on the certificate. (3-4-10) a. A retailer must collect tax on the sale of any goods that are s pecifically excluded from an exemption as a matter of law. Fo r ex ample, a purchaser claiming the production exemption provided by Section 63- 3622D, Idaho Code, may not claim an exemption on the sale of it ems that are specifically excluded from the exemption as a matter of law, such as: (3-6-00) i. Maintenance and janitorial equipment and supplies; (3-6-00) ii. Office equipment and supplies; (3-6-00) iii. Selling and distribution equipment and supplies; (3-6-00) iv. Property used in transportation activities; (3-6-00) v. Equipment or other property used to make repairs; (3-6-00) vi. Tangible personal property which becomes a component of any real property or any improvement or fixture thereto; (3-6-00) vii. Licensed motor vehicles; (3-6-00)STATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-1702 Idaho Sales & Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 271 September 6, 2017 - Vol. 1 7-9viii. Aircraft; and (3-6-00) ix. Recreational -related vehicles as defined Section 63-3622HH, Idaho Code .(3-6-00) ( ) b. Example: A farmer completes an S T-101 claiming a production exe mption on the purchase of toothpaste and a case of motor oil. The retailer must collect t he sales tax on the sale of the toothpaste, but is not liable for the collection of the sales tax on the sale of the motor oi l. The retailer cannot rely on the exemption certificate when selling the toothpaste because, as a matter of law, the sa le of personal hygiene products is excluded from the production exemption. But the retailer can rely on the exemptio n certificate when selling go ods, such as the motor oil, which the farmer could put to either a nontaxable use (e.g., oi l for a tractor), or a taxable use (e.g., oil for a licensed pickup truck). (3-25-16) c. A retailer cannot rely on an exemption certificate obtained fro m a purchaser when the law does not provide an exemption from the tax for the purchaser, such as a nonprofit organization not specifically exempted by the sales tax law or a governmental agency of another state. (3-6-00) d. Nor can a retailer rely on an e xemption certificate when the li mited language of the law pertaining to the exemption claimed excludes all but certain goods from th e exemption. For example, certain contractors can execute an ST-101 to purchase construction materials for specif ic jobs in non-taxing states claiming an exemption from tax under Section 63-3622B, Idaho Code, and Rule 012 of th ese rules. The retailer must collect tax on any goods that are not to be incorporated into the real property, such as parts for construction equipment and tools. (3-6-00) e. In lieu of Form ST-101, retailers, when selling property that t he purchaser claims is entitled to the production exemption, may stamp or imprint on the face of their sales invoices, or purchasers may stamp or imprint on the face of their purchase orders, a certificate containing the following language: (3-4-10) I certify that the property which I have here purchased will be used by me directly and primarily in the process of producing tangible personal property by mining, manu facturing, processing, fabricating, or farming, or as a repair part for equipment used primarily as described above. This tax exemption statement qualifies if this statement is sig ned by the purchaser and the name, address, and nature of business of the purchaser is shown on the invoice . Any person who signs this certification with the intention of e vading payment of tax is guilty of a misdemeanor. The signature on this certificate must be in addition to any ot her signature required on the invoice. If no Form ST-101 is on file with the vendor, then each exempt sale m ust be documented as described in this Subsection. (3-4-10) f. Information on the exemption certificate. An exemption certific ate shall show the purchaser's name and address, business name and address, and be signed and dated by the purchaser. The purchaser shall also provide on the certificate the specific exemption being claimed and, if the production exemption is being claimed, a list of the products the purchaser produces. If the purchaser is claiming the contractor exemption, the purchaser must identify the invoice, purchase order, or job number to which the claim a pplies, the city and state where the job is located, and the name of the project owner. If the purchaser is claiming an exemption as an American Indian, then the purchaser must provide a valid Tribal I.D. number. By signing the exempti on certificate, the purchaser is certifying that the purch ase qualifies for an exemption from tax. (4-4-13) 08. Purchaser's Responsibility . A purchaser has the responsibility to properly complete a cer tificate and ensure that tax is charged on all taxable purchases. If the purchaser properly provides a certificate and normally NATURE OF BUSINESS BUYER'S SIGNATURESTATE TAX COMMISSION Docket No. 35-0102-1702 Idaho Sales & Use Tax Administrative Rules Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 272 September 6, 2017 - Vol. 1 7-9makes exempt purchases, he nevertheless must ensure that tax is paid when a taxable purchase is made. If the seller does not charge the tax on a taxable purchase the purchaser mus t either notify the seller to correct the billing and then pay the sales tax to the seller, or accrue and remit use tax on the transaction. If the purchaser intentionally or repeatedly makes purchases, claiming they are exempt, when in fact they are not exempt, and the purchaser fails to remit use tax, a penalty can be imposed in addition to the use tax. The penalty amount that may be asserted against the purchaser is five percent (5%) of the sales price or two hundred dollars ($200), whichever is greater. The penalty will be asserted by the Commission as a Notice of Deficiency but the purchaser may have the penalty abated when he can establish that there were reasonable grounds for believing that the purchase was properly exempt from tax. In addition, if the purchaser give s a resale or exemption certific ate with the intention of evading payment of the tax, the purchaser may be charged with a criminal misdemeanor and could be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year , or by both a fine and imprisonment. (3-4-10) a. Example: A garden supply store sells, among other things, soil and wood chips in large quantities. It buys a loader to use in its business to load items into cust omers' trucks. When buying the loader, the garden supply store gives a resale certificate to the seller indicating it in tends to resell the loader. However, upon purchase the loader is capitalized on the books of the garden supply store. The Com mission could impose a penalty equal to five percent (5%) of the purchase price of the loader against the garden supply store. This penalty is in addition to the use tax that is due. The individual who execu ted the certificate, or authori zed the execution, on behalf of the garden supply store, if done with intent to evade payment of the use tax, could be c riminally charged with a misdemeanor. (3-4-10) b. Example: A restaurant buys food for resale from a supplier. It can properly give a resale certificate to the supplier. Since it buys food on a continuing basis the s upplier keeps a certificate on file. If the restaurant buys cleaning supplies for its own consumption, the supplier should charge sales tax. If it fails to charge tax, the restaurant should notify the supplier to correct the billing and collect t he sales tax. If the restaurant fails to pay sales or use tax on more than one purchase, then, under Section 63-3624, Idaho C ode, the Commission can assert a use tax and a penalty equal to five percent (5%) of the purchase price or two hundred dollars ($200), whichever is greater, against the restaurant. (3-4-10) 09. Timely Acceptance of Certificates . A seller may accept a certificate from a purchaser prior to t he time of sale, at the time of sale, or at any reasonable time af ter the sale to establish the exemption claim, with the exception of Forms ST-104-HM and ST-104G which must be provided at the time of sale. However, if no approved certificate is obtained from the purchaser in the manner provid ed or permitted by this rule, the sale is presumed to be taxable. (3-6-00) a. Certificates obtained by a seller at a time subsequent to, but not within a reasonable time after, the time of sale will be considered by the State Tax Commission in conjunction with all other evidence available to determine whether or not the seller has established that a sales tax tran saction is exempt from tax. (3-4-10) b. Example: A retailer sells goods to a customer without charging the sales tax but does not obtain an ST-101 from the customer. Instead , the customer writes his sell er's permit number on the invoice when he signs for the goods. The retailer is later audited by the State Tax Commi ssion and fails in an attempt to obtain a certificate from his customer. The retailer argues that the seller's permit numb er written on the invoice is evidence that the customer purchased the goods for resale. However the number by itself do es not establish that the customer bought the goods for resale. The retailer is liable for the tax on the sale. (3-4-10) c. Example: A retailer sells a truck load of hay to a customer, do es not charge sales tax on the transaction, and fails to obtain an ST-101. The retailer is lat er audited by the State Tax Commission and is unable to obtain an ST-101 from the customer. The retailer argues that ha y is a farm supply and this alone should establish that the sale is exempt. However, the customer may be in a business which does not qualify for the farming production exemption, such as racing or showing horses. Or, the customer m ay be using the hay for a nonbusiness purpose, such as raising animals for his own consumption. The retailer is lia ble for the tax on the sale. (3-4-10) d. When a Notice of Deficiency Determination has been issued to a seller by the State Tax Commission and the seller petitions for redetermination as prov ided by Rule 121 of these rules, he may submit certificates obtained from his cu stomers as evidence of exempti on claims, but only if the certificates are presented to the State Tax Commission within ninety (90) days of the date of the Notice of Deficiency Determination.

Effective July 1, 1988, h Hotels, motels, lodging operators, short-term rentals, vacation rentals, and campgrounds may purchase tangible personal property for consump tion by their customers without paying tax if the tangible personal property is in cluded in the fee charged to th e customer and is directly consumed by the customer in s u c h a w a y t h a t i t c a n n o t b e r e u s e d . H o t e l s , m o t e l s , lodging operators, short-term rentals, vacation rentals, a n d campgrounds must provide a resale certificate to their vendor w hen purchasing such items for resale.

Sections 63-3622S, 63-3622T, 63-3622W, & 63-3622JJ, Idaho Code 01.Exempt Hand Tools . The Idaho sales tax law exempts hand tools with a unit price of over one hundred dollars ($100) if the hand tools are used directly and primarily in any of the following operations: (7-1-93) a.Broadcasting, Section 63-3622S, Idaho Code. (7-1-93) 02.Unit. A unit, as applied to hand tools, means a single, distinct part or object which can be used by itself to perform a specific function. For example, a screwdriver can be used by itself to tighten or loosen a screw. When units, such as screwdrivers, are sold in sets to a manufacturer who will use the tools primarily and directly in the production process, i.e., to assemble product, a per unit price must be computed to determine if the purchase qualifies for the over one hundred dollars ($100) per unit exemption. When a manufacturer purchases a set of twenty (20) wrenches for one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125) to be used in product assembly, the purchase is taxable because the per unit price of the hand tools is less than one hundred dollars ($100). (7-1-93) 03.Component . A unit may be composed of two (2) or more components. A component is a distinct part which must be physically attached to another part to perform a specific function. A component alone has no utility. For example, a drill bit must be physically attached to a drill in order for the bit or the drill to have utility. Together they become a unit which can perform a specific function. Single components or sets of components, sockets, drill bits, etc., are taxable unless they will be physically joined to another component, ratchet, drill, etc., to form a unit which exceeds one hundred dollars ($100) in cost. For example, drill bits which are physically attached to a five hundred dollar ($500) drill press to perform a specific function in a production process are exempt from the tax. (7-1-93) 04.Unit Price . The total amount extended on a purchase invoice for multiple units is not the unit price. The unit price must be computed to determine whether the hand tool exceeds one hundred dollars ($100) and qualifies for a given exemption.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: This rule change is being initiated based on the passage of Sen ate Bill 1043a (2017) that amended Section 49- 1010, Idaho Code. The change being made addresses the movement of implements of husbandry and when such movement must be permitted or is allowed to move without an ove rlegal permit. Language has been modified to exempt equipment dealers moving implements of husbandry larger than legal size to or from a farm to a dealer for repair, rental, lease or purchase.TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(b), Idaho Code, the Governor ha s found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate for the foll owing reasons: The rule change is needed to align IDAPA rule with Idaho Code, due to the passage of Senate Bill 1043a (2017) which went into effect March 24, 2017.FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge i mposed or increased: There are no fees being imposed or increased with this rulemaking.FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: There is no impact to the state general fund. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67-5220(2), Idaho Code, negotiated rulemak ing was not conducted because the rule change is simple in nature. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following i s a brief synopsis of why the materials cited are being incorporated by r eference into this rule: N/A ASSISTANCE ON TECHNICAL QUESTIONS, SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN COMMEN TS: For assistance on technical questions concerning the temporary and proposed ru le, contact Craig Roberts, Compliance Program Supervisor, at (208) 334-8292.

OVERWIDTH PERMITS FOR IMPLEMENTS OF HUSBANDRY. 01. Farm Tractors on Interstate Highways . Farm tractors transported on Interstate Highways are required to have overlegal permit authority if width exceeds nine (9) feet. A farm tractor when attached to an implement of husbandry or when drawing an implement of husbandry shall be construed to be an implement of husbandry and is not required to have a permit. Farmers, equipment dealers or custom operators may be issued single trip or annual permits under this rule for transportation of fa rm tractors, having a width in excess of nine (9) feet to or from a farm involving Interstate Highway travel. The transporta tion of farm tractors or implements of husbandry for hire, or not being transported from one farm operation to anoth er, is a common-carrier operation. Exemptions from legal width limitation do not apply to common-carrier operation s. Farm tractors or implements of husbandry hauled for hire, or used in the furtherance of a business (not to incl ude farming operations), are subject to the same overlegal permit regulations as other oversize loads when the width of th e load exceeds legal-width limitations, and must operate under oversize permits. (3-30-01) 02. Other Than Farm to Farm . Implements of husbandry exceeding eight (8) feet six (6) inch es in width being transported other than from one (1) farm operation to another farm operation shall require overlegal permits except when the farmer or their designated agent s, including without limitation, equipment dealers is transporting implements of husban dry and equipment for the purp ose of: (3-29-12) (7-21-17)T a. The repair or maintenance of such implements of husbandry and e quipment when traveling between to or from a farm and to a repair or maintenance facility during daylight hours; or (3-29-12) (7-21-17)T b. The purchase , or s a l e , lease or rental of such implements of husbandry or equipment when traveling between a farm and a dealership, auction house, or ot her facility during daylight hours. (3-29-12) (7-21-17)T 03. Farm Permits . Single trip permits must be ordered at the permit office. Und er provisions of IDAPA 39.03.19, \"Rules Governing Annual Overlegal Permits,\" Sec tion 100, annual permits will be issued to towing units or to self-propelled farm tractors or towed units, or bla nket permits may be issued to an Idaho domicile applicant without vehicle identification. Such blanket permits may be transferred from one vehicle to another vehicle but shall be valid only when the permit is with the overwidth v ehicle and/or load. A photocopy of the permit is valid provided that the Pilot/Escort Vehicle and Travel Time Requirem ents Map and Vertical Clearance of Structures Map furnished by the Idaho Transportation Department are included. Such annual permits for implements of husbandry or farm tractors are subject to the same maximum dimensions, trave l time exclusions and safety requirements as other overwidth annual permits and are valid for continuous travel fo r twelve (12) consecutive months. (3-25-16) 04. Overwidth Farm Trailers . Trailers or semi-trailers exceeding eight feet six inches (8' 6\") wide, but not wider than the implement of husbandry, used for the tra nsportation of implements of husbandry from a farm to or from a farm for agricultural operations, shall be exempt from overl egal permitting requirements. This exemption does not apply to trailers or semi-trailers used in common carr ier operations, hauling for hire or used in the furtherance of a business (not to include farming operations). (3-29-12) (7-21-17)T a. Exempt trailers, as listed above, may not be used to haul imple ments of husbandry that are narrower than the overwidth trailer. (3-20-04) b. Empty trailers, as listed above, being used to pick up or drop off an implement of husbandry from a farm to a farm are also exempt and must be reduced to a practical minimum dimension (i.e. dropping side extensions).

This rulemaking action is author ized by Sections 39-105, 39-107, and 39-3601 et seq., Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political s ubdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before September 22, 2017. If no such written request is received, a public hearing pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, will not be held. The public will have the opportunity to provide oral comments on the proposed rule during the November 16, 2017 , meeting of the Idaho Board of Environmental Quality (Board).DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: This rulemaking has been initiated to update DEQ's existing ha rdness dependent criteria by using EPA's 2007 304(a) copper criteria. This updat e is a Reasonable and Prudent Alternative identified in National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) biolog ical opinion (BiOp) on Idaho's criteria for toxic substances to support aquatic life. The toxicity of copper to aquatic life is highly variable depending on physicochemical factors within a water body. The effect of hardness on metal toxicity has long been ac knowledged as one such factor and is reflected in DEQ's current hardness dependent criteria, whereby the acute an d chronic criteria are determined based on the total hardness of the receiving water body. However, DEQ's current ha rdness dependent criteria do not take into account the effects of other physicochemical properties of the receivin g water body which affect toxicity, leading to DEQ's current criteria being either over- or under-protective of aqua tic life. This action is identified in NOAA's BiOp on Idaho's criteria fo r toxic substances to support aquatic life. This BiOp concluded that the current copper criteria were not always protective of aquatic life and would result in adverse modification of critical habitat. NOAA's recommendation is to u se EPA's 2007 304(a) copper criteria, which uses other physicochemical properties of the water (e.g., pH, dissol ved organic carbon, etc.) to predict water-body specific criteria known as the Biotic Ligand Model (BLM). NOAA has calle d for state adoption and EPA approval or EPA promulgation of these criteria by May 2017. Because of this, DEQ's 2014 triennial review identified revision of the aquatic life criteria for copper as a high priority. By adopting a copper criterion based o n the BLM, DEQ will be able to use the most current state of the science to ensure that the criteria are more precise and are neither unnecessarily burdening dischargers nor increasing risk to aquatic life. This proposed rule replaces the existing hardness dependent cri teria for copper with a similar, albeit more detailed, modeled approach. Additionally, the proposed rule ref erences the \"Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Copper Criteria for Aquatic Life: Using the Biotic Ligand Model \" which details procedures for implementing the criteria including determining minimum data requirements for BL M inputs and guidance for estimating protective criteria when data are incomplete or absent. Idahoans that recreate in, drink from, or fish Idaho's surface waters and all who discharge pollutants to those same waters may be interested in commenting on this proposed ru le. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board on November 16, 2017, for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to become final and effective upon the conclusion of t he 2018 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. EFFECTIVE FOR CLEAN WATER ACT PURPOSES: Water quality standards adopted and submitted to EPA since May 30, 2000, are not effective for federal Clean Water Act (CWA) purposes until EPA approves them (see 40 CFR 131.21 ). This is known as the Alaska Rule. This rulemaking will be pr omulgated so that the existing rule, which continues to be effective for CWA purposes, remains in the Idah o Administrative Code until EPA approves the rule revisions. Notations explaining the effectiveness of the rule s ections are also included. Upon EPA approval, the revised rule will become effective for CWA purposes and the pre vious rule and notations will be deleted from the Idaho Administrative Code. Information regarding the status of EPA review will be posted at http:// www.deq.idaho.gov/epa-actions-on-proposed-standardsDEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0102-1502 Water Quality Standards Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 295 September 6, 2017 - Vol. 1 7-9INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE: Pursuant to Section 67-5229(2)(a), Idaho Code, the following i s a brief synopsis of why the incorpora tion by reference is necessary: EPA national recommended criteria, \" Aquatic Life Ambient Freshwater Quality Criteria - Copper \": EPA- 822-R-07-001 (February 2007), is incorporated by reference in t he proposed rule. This document provides guidance for calculating aquatic life crite ria for copper using the Biot ic Ligand Model software. Incorporation by reference benefits the regulated community by ensuring that the state rul e is consistent with the EPA guidance. The alternative to incorporating by reference is to restate the document in the rule, which would be impractical and costly. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: The text of the proposed rule was drafted based on discussions held and concerns raised during negotiations conducted pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 6 7-5220 and IDAPA 58.01.23.810-815. The Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the October 2015 issue o f the Idaho Administrative Bulletin, and a preliminary draft rule was made available for public review. Ni ne negotiated rulemaking and guidance development meetings were held between October 28, 2015, and July 18, 2017. Key information was posted on the DEQ rulemaking web page and distributed to the public. Members of t he public participated in the negotiated rulemaking process by attending the meetings and by submitting written com ments. All comments received during the negotiated rulemaking process were considered by DEQ when making decisions regarding development of the rule. For comments that were not incorporated into the draft rule, DEQ's response to those comments is in cluded in the negotiated rulema king summary. At the conclusion of the negotiated rulemaking process, DEQ formatted the final draft for publicati on as a proposed rule. DEQ is now seeking public comment on the proposed rule. The negotiated rulemaking record, which includes the negotiated rule drafts, written public comments, documents distributed during the negotiated ru lemaking process, and the negotiated rulemaking summary, is available at www.deq.idaho.gov/58-0102-1502 . IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: This proposed rule does not regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government, nor is it broader in scope or more s tringent than federal regulations. FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousand doll ars ($10,000) during the fiscal year when the pending rule will become effective: Not applicable.

EPA approved this action in 2010. In June 2016, Northwest Environmental Advocates challenged EPA's 2010 a pproval. Court remanded action back to EPA. On September 15, 2016 EPA disapproved Idaho's adoption of 10 \u00b5g/L. Until new criteria are adopted, EPA will use criteria of 6.2 \u00b5g/L for exposure through fish consumption only and 0.02 \u00b5g/L for exposure through both drinking water + consumption of fish in its NPDES permitting actions.

The decision was made to remove the old tissue-based aquatic life criteria and rely on the fish tissue criterion to provide protection for aquatic life as well as human health. Thus, current Idaho water quality standards do not have mercury water column criteria for the pro tection of aquatic life. While EPA approved Idaho's adoption of the fish tissue criterion in September 2005, it had withheld judgment on Idaho's removal of aquatic life cri - teria. On December 12, 2008, EPA disapproved Idaho's removal of the old aquatic life criteria. The water column cri - teria for total recoverable mercury published in 2004 Idaho Administrative Code continue to apply and are effective for CWA purposes.

Factors for Calculating Hardness Dependent Metals Criteria . Hardness dependent metals criteria are calculated using values from the following table i n the equations: (5-3-03)i. Aquatic life criteria for these metals are a function of total hardness (mg/L as calcium carbonate), the pollutant's water effect ratio (WER) as defined in Subsection 2 10.03.c.iii. and multiplied by an appropriate dissolved conversion factor as defined in Subsection 210.02. For comparative purposes only, the example values displayed in this table are shown as dissolved metal and correspond to a total hardness of one hundred (100) mg/L and a water effect ratio of one (1.0). j. Criteria are expressed as weak acid dissociable (WAD) cyanide. k. Total chlorine residual concentrations. l. EPA guidance allows states to choose from a range of 10 -4 to 10-6 for the incremental increase in cancer risk used in human health criteria calculation. Idaho has chosen to base this criterion on carcinogenicity of 10-5 risk. m. Aquatic life criteria for pentachlorophenol are expressed as a function of pH, and are calculated as follows. Values displayed above in the table correspond to a pH of seven and eight tenths (7.8). CMC = exp(1.005(pH)-4.830)CCC = exp(1.005(pH)-5.290) n. PCBs are a class of chemicals which include Aroclors, 1242, 125 4, 1221, 11096 825 and 12674112 respectively. The aquatic life criteria apply to this set of PCBs. o. This criterion applies to total PCBs, (e.g. the sum of all cong ener, isomer, or Aroclor analyses). p. This fish tissue residue criterion (TRC) for methylmercury is b ased on a human health reference dose (RfD) of 0.0001 mg/kg body weight-day; a relative source contribution (R SC) estimated to be 27% of the RfD; a human body weight (BW) of 70 kg (for adults); and a total fish consumption rate of 0.0175 kg/day for the general population, summed from trophic level (TL) breakdown of TL2 = 0.0038 + TL4 = 0.0057 kg fish/day. This is a criterion that is protective of the general population. A site-specific criterion or a criterion for a particular subpopulation may be calculated by using local or re gional data, rather than the above default values, in the formula: TRC = [BW x {RfD - (RSCxRfD)}] / TL. In waters inh abited by species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act or designated as th eir critical habitat, the Department will apply the human health fish tissue residue criterion for methylmercury to the highest trophic level available for sampling and analysis. q. This criterion is based on the drinking water Maximum Contamina nt Level (MCL). r. Aquatic life criteria for copper shall be derived in accordance with Subsection 210.03.c.v. For comparative purposes only, the example values displayed in this table correspond to the Biotic Ligand Model output based on the following inputs: temperature = 14.9\u00b0C, pH = 8.16, dissolved organic carbon = 1.4 mg/L, humic acid fraction = 10%, calcium = 44.6 mg/L, magnesium = 11.0 mg/L, sodium = 11.7 mg/L, potassium = 2.12 mg/L, sulfate = 46.2 mg/L, chloride 12.7 = 1.00 x 10-8 mg/L.

Application of aquatic life metals criteria. (3-25-16) i. For metals other than cadmium, for purposes of calculating ha rdness dependent aquatic life criteria from the equations in Subsection 210.02, the minimum hardness a llowed for use in those equations shall not be less than twenty-five (25) mg/l, as calcium carbonate, even if the a ctual ambient hardness is less than twenty-five (25) mg/ l as calcium carbonate. For cadmi um, the minimum hardness for u se in those equations shall not be less than ten (10) mg/l, as calcium carbonate. The maximum hardness allowed for us e in those equations shall not be greater than four hundred (400) mg/l, as calcium carbonate, except as specified i n Subsections 210.03.c.ii. and 210.03.c.iii., even if the actual ambient hardness is greater than four hundred (400) mg/l as calcium carbonate. (3-29-10) ii. The hardness values used for calculating aquatic life criter ia for metals at design discharge conditions shall be representative of the ambient hardnesses fo r a receiving water that occur at the design discharge conditions given in Subsection 210.03.b. (5-3-03) iii. Except as otherwise noted, the aquatic life criteria for me tals (compounds #1 through #13 in the criteria table of Subsection 210.02) are expressed as dissolved metal concentrations. Unle ss otherwise specified by the Department, dissolved concentrations are considered to be c oncentrations recovered from a sample which has passed through a forty-five hundredths (0.45) micron filter. Fo r the purposes of calculating aquatic life criteria for metals from the equations in footnotes e. and i. in the criteri a table in Subsection 210.01, the water effect ratio is computed as a specific pollutant's acute or chronic toxicity va lues measured in water from the site covered by the standard, divided by the respect ive acute or chronic toxicity value in laboratory dilution water. The water-effect ratio shall be assigned a value of one (1.0), except where the Depart ment assigns a different value that protects the designated uses of the water body from the toxic effects of the pollutant, and is derived from suitable tests on sampled water representative of conditions in the affected water body, consistent with the design discharge conditions established in Subsection 210.03.b. For purposes of calculating water effects ratios, the term acute toxicity value is the toxicity test results, such as the concentration lethal one -half (1/2) of the test organi sms (i.e., LC5O) after ninety- six (96) hours of exposure (e.g., fish toxicity tests) or the e ffect concentration to one-half of the test organisms, (i.e., Aquatic Life Human Health CMC (\"acute\" criteria) 1Q10 or 1B3 Non-carcinogens Harmonic mean f low (\"chronic\" criteria) 7Q10 or 4B3 Carcinogens Harmonic mean flowDEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0102-1502 Water Quality Standards Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 307 September 6, 2017 - Vol. 1 7-9EC5O) after forty-eight (48) hours of exposure (e.g., daphnia t oxicity tests). For purposes of calculating water effects ratios, the term chronic value is the result from appropriate hypothesis testing or regression analysis of measurements of growth, reproduction, or survival from life cycle, partial l ife cycle, or early life stage tests. The determination of acute and chronic values shall be according to current standard protocols (e.g., those published by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)) or other comparable m ethods. For calculation of criteria using site- specific values for both the hardness and the water effect rati o, the hardness used in the equations in Subsection 210.02 shall be as required in Subsection 210.03.c.ii. Water ha rdness shall be calculated from the measured calcium and magnesium ions present, and the ratio of calcium to magnesi um shall be approximately the same in laboratory toxicity testing water as in the site water, or be similar to a verage ratios of laboratory waters used to derive the criteria. (4-6-05) iv. Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria. (4-6-05) (1) The \"Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Qua lity Criteria\" describes in detail suggested methods for discharge related monitoring requirements , calculation of reasonable potential to exceed (RPTE) water quality criteria in determining need for mercury e ffluent limits, and use of fish tissue mercury data in calculating mercury load reductions. This guidance, or its upda tes, will provide assistance to the Department and the public when implementing the methylmercury criterion. The \"Impl ementation Guidan ce for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria\" also provides basic background information on mercury in the environment, the novelty of a fish tissue criterion for water quality, the connection between huma n health and aquatic life protection, and the relation of environmental programs outside of Clean Water Act programs to r educing mercury contamination of the environment. The \"Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria\" is available at the Department of Environmental Quality, 1410 N. Hilton, Boise, Ida ho 83706, and on the DEQ website at http:// www.deq.idaho.gov/media/639808-idaho_mercury_wq_guidance.pdf . (4-6-05) (2) The implementation of a fish tissue criterion in NPDES permi t s a n d T M D L s r e q u i r e s a n o n - traditional approach, as the basic criterion is not a concentra tion in water. In applying the methylmercury fish tissue criterion in the context of NPDES effluent limits and TMDL load reductions, the Department will assume change in fish tissue concentrations of methylmercury are proportional to change in water body loading of total mercury. Reasonable potential to exceed (RPTE) the fish tissue criterion for existing NPDES sources will be based on measured fish tissue concentrati ons potentially affected by the discharge exceeding a specified threshold value, based on uncertainty due to measurement variability. This threshold v alue is also used for TMDL decisions. Because measured fish tissue concentrations do not reflect the effect o f proposed new or increased discharge of mercury, RPTE in these cases will be based upon an estimated fish tissue methylmercury concentration, using projected changes in waterbody loading of total mercury and a proportiona l response in fish tissue mercury. For the above purposes, mercury will be measured in the skinless filets of sp ort fish using techniques capable of detecting tissue concentrations down to point zero five (0.05) mg/kg. Total merc ury analysis may be used, but will be assumed to be all m ethy lmercury for purposes of implementing the criterion. (4-6-05) v.Copper Criteria for Aquatic Life.

This rulemaking action is author ized by Sections 39-105, 39-107, and 39-3601 et seq., Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hearing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political s ubdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be received by the undersigned on or before September 22, 2017. If no such written request is received, a public hearing pursuant to Section 67-5222(2), Idaho Code, will not be held. The public will have the opportunity to provide oral comments on the proposed rule during the November 16, 2017 , meeting of the Idaho Board of Environmental Quality (Board).DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: This rulemaking has been initiated to update the selenium cr iteria for aquatic life use. This proposed update is identified as a Reasonable and Pru dent Alternative (RPA) in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) biological opinion (BiOp) o n Idaho's criteria for toxic substances to support aquatic life. This BiOp concluded that the current selenium cri terion was likely to adversely affect endangered species and would result in adverse modification of critical ha bitat. The NOAA recommendation is to use EPA's 2016 304(a) selenium criterion based on fish-tissue concentrations. NOAA has called for state adoption and EPA approval or EPA promulgation of this criterion by May 2018. In order to avoid EPA promulgating a federal selenium standard for Idaho, DEQ initiated this rulemaking for a revised selenium aquatic life criterion in Idaho's water quality standards. DEQ's 2014 triennial review identified revision of t he aquatic life criteria for selenium as a medium priority. Although selenium may cause acute toxicity at high concentratio ns, the most detrimental effect on aquatic organisms is due to its bioaccumulative properties. Aquatic org anisms exposed to selenium accumulate it primarily through their diets and not directly through water. In fish, se lenium toxicity occurs primarily through transfer to the eggs, reducing reproductive success and survival. Current crite ria derived from water column concentrations do not take into account the effects of selenium bioaccumulation in aq uatic systems and are generally under-protective of aquatic life. The proposed criterion is derived from the allowa ble concentration of seleniu m in fish tissue found to be protective of aquatic life. The fish-tissue concentration, in c onjunction with site-specific bioaccumulation factors, can be used to determine the allowabl e concentration of selenium in ambient water. Aquatic communities are expected to be protected by this chronic criterion from any potential acute effects of selenium. By adopting the fish-tissue-derived criterion, DEQ will ensure that its criterion neither unnecessa rily burdens dischargers nor increases risk to aquatic life. This proposed rule replaces the existing water column based cri teria for selenium with a four-part criterion. The recommended elements are (1) a fish egg-ovary element, (2) a fish whole-body and/or muscle element, (3) a water column element which includes one value for lentic (still water ) and one value for lotic (running water) aquatic systems, and (4) a water column intermittent element to account for potential chronic effects from short-term exposures (one value for lentic and one value for lotic aquatic systems). This proposed rule also includes the addition of Section 287, S ite-Specific Aquatic Life Criteria for Selenium. Subsections 287.01 through 287.04 were negotiated in response t o proposals for site-specific selenium criteria submitted by Nu-West Industries, Inc., and Subsections 287.01 and set out site- specific selenium criteria for Upper Blackfoot River and George town Creek Watersheds. Subsections 287.03 and 287.04 set out the site-specific selenium criteria for Hoopes S pring, Sage Creek, and Crow Creek near the Smoky Canyon Mine. The negotiated rulemaking also included site-speci fic selenium criteria for portions of Idaho (Subsection 287.05). This proposed rule applies to all waters of the state except the main stems of the Kootenai, Salmon, and Snake Rivers within the historic range of white stu rgeon, as well as subbasins flowing directly into the aforementioned rivers and those designated as critical salmonid habitat or bull trout habitat.

These documents are available at www.deq.idaho.gov/58-0102-1701 . Idahoans that recreate in, drink from, or fish Idaho's surface waters and all who discharge pollutants to those same waters may be interested in commenting on this proposed ru le. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board on November 16, 2017, for adoption of a pending rule. The rule is expected to become final and effective upon the conclusion of t he 2018 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. EFFECTIVE FOR CLEAN WATER ACT PURPOSES: Water quality standards adopted and submitted to EPA since May 30, 2000, are not effective for federal Clean Water Act (CWA) purposes until EPA approves them (see 40 CFR 131.21 ). This is known as the Alaska Rule. This rulemaking will be pr omulgated so that the existing rule, which continues to be effective for CWA purposes, remains in the Idah o Administrative Code until EPA approves the rule revisions. Notations explaining the effectiveness of the rule s ections are also included. Upon EPA approval, the revised rule will become effective for CWA purposes and the pre vious rule and notations will be deleted from the Idaho Administrative Code.

NUMERIC CRITERIA FOR TOXIC SUBSTANCES FOR WATERS DESIGNATED F O R AQUATIC LIFE, RECREATION, OR DOMESTIC WATER SUPPLY USE. 01. Criteria for Toxic Substances . The criteria of Section 210 apply to surface waters of the st ate as follows. (5-3-03) a. Columns B1and B2 of the following table apply to waters designa ted for aquatic life use. (3-25-16) b. Column C2 of the following table applies to waters designated f or primary or secondary contact recreation use. (3-25-16) c. Column C1 of the following table applies to waters designated f or domestic water supply use.Note: In 2016, Idaho updated human health criteria for 104 toxic substances (10 of which are new). Final rule submitted to EPA on December 13, 2016 (docket 58-0102-1201 ). Until EPA approves the revisions in this rule docket, the human health criteria published in 2005 Idaho Administrative Code in Subsection 210.01 continue to apply and are effective for CWA purposes. Th ese criteria are listed in Numeric Criteria for Toxic Substances (2005) . The previous human health criteria based on a fish consumptio n rate of 6.5 g/ day published in 2005 Idaho Administrative Code in Subsection 210.05.b.i. continue to apply and are effec - tive for CWA purposes. Until EPA approves the revisions in this rule docket, the additional fish-plus-water criterion for copper; the revisions in Subsections 070.08, 210.03, 210.04, 210.05.b.ii. and 400.06; and the definition of harmonic mean published in 2015 Idaho Administrative Code continue to apply and are effec - tive for CWA purposes.

AB Aquatic lifeC Human health 5.2 c 190 c 2 Arsenic 7440382 340 e 150 e Y 10 dfq 10 dfq Note: In 2008, Idaho adopted 10 \u00b5g/L as its CWA arsenic criteri on for both exposure through fish consumption only and exposure through drinking water+fish consumption, choosing the SDWA MCL due to concerns about back - ground levels that exceed EPA's 304(a) criteria (docket 58-0102 -0801). EPA approved this action in 2010. In June 2016, Northwest Environmental Advocates challenged EPA's 2010 a pproval. Court remanded action back to EPA. On September 15, 2016 EPA disapproved Idaho's adoption of 10 \u00b5g/L. Until new criteria are adopted, EPA will use criteria of 6.2 \u00b5g/L for exposure through fish consumption only and 0.02 \u00b5g/L for exposure through both drinking water + consumption of fish in its NPDES permitting actions. Th ese criteria are published in 1996 Idaho Administra- tive Code (Subsections 250.01.c, 250.02.a.iv, 250.03.a.i).

The decision was made to remove the old tissue-based aquatic life criteria and rely on the fish tissue criterion to provide protection for aquatic life as well as human health. Thus, current Idaho water quality standards do not have mercury water column criteria for the pro tection of aquatic life. While EPA approved Idaho's adoption of the fish tissue criterion in September 2005, it had withheld judgment on Idaho's removal of aquatic life cri - teria. On December 12, 2008, EPA disapproved Idaho's removal of the old aquatic life criteria.

CCC = column B2 valu e X WER. f. Criterion expressed as total recoverable (unfiltered) concentrations. g. No aquatic life criterion is adopted for inorganic mercury. How ever, the narrative criteria for toxics in Section 200 of these rules applies. The Department believes application of the human health criterion for methylmercury will be protective of aquatic life in most situations. h. No numeric human health criteria has been established for this contaminant. However, permit authorities should address this contaminant in NPDES permit actions using the narrative criteria for toxics from Section 200 of these rules.AB Aquatic lifeC Human health for consumption (\u00b5g/L) C2DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0102-1701 Water Quality Standards Proposed Rulemaking Idaho Administrative Bulletin Page 321 September 6, 2017 - Vol. 1 7-9i. Aquatic life criteria for these metals are a function of total hardness (mg/L as calcium carbonate), the pollutant's water effect ratio (WER) as defined in Subsection 2 10.03.c.iii. and multiplied by an appropriate dissolved conversion factor as defined in Subsection 210.02. For comparative purposes only, the example values displayed in this table are shown as dissolved metal and correspond to a total hardness of one hundred (100) mg/L and a water effect ratio of one (1.0). j. Criteria are expressed as weak acid dissociable (WAD) cyanide. k. Total chlorine residual concentrations. l. EPA guidance allows states to choose from a range of 10 -4 to 10-6 for the incremental increase in cancer risk used in human health criteria calculation. Idaho has chosen to base this criterion on carcinogenicity of 10-5 risk. m. Aquatic life criteria for pentachlorophenol are expressed as a function of pH, and are calculated as follows. Values displayed above in the table correspond to a pH of seven and eight tenths (7.8). CMC = exp(1.005(pH)-4.830)CCC = exp(1.005(pH)-5.290) n. PCBs are a class of chemicals which include Aroclors, 1242, 125 4, 1221, 11096 825 and 12674112 respectively. The aquatic life criteria apply to this set of PCBs. o. This criterion applies to total PCBs, (e.g. the sum of all cong ener, isomer, or Aroclor analyses). p. This fish tissue residue criterion (TRC) for methylmercury is b ased on a human health reference dose (RfD) of 0.0001 mg/kg body weight-day; a relative source contribution (R SC) estimated to be 27% of the RfD; a human body weight (BW) of 70 kg (for adults); and a total fish consumption rate of 0.0175 kg/day for the general population, summed from trophic level (TL) breakdown of TL2 = 0.0038 + TL4 = 0.0057 kg fish/day. This is a criterion that is protective of the general population. A site-specific criterion or a criterion for a particular subpopulation may be calculated by using local or re gional data, rather than the above default values, in the formula: TRC = [BW x {RfD - (RSCxRfD)}] / TL. In waters inh abited by species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act or designated as th eir critical habitat, the Department will apply the human health fish tissue residue criterion for methylmercury to the highest trophic level available for sampling and analysis. q. This criterion is based on the drinking water Maximum Contamina nt Level (MCL). r.

Single measurement of an average or composite sample of at least five (5) individuals of the same species where the smallest individual is no less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the total length (size) of the largest individual. 3.Water column values are based on dissolved total selenium in water and are derived from fish tissue values via bioaccumulation modeling. Water column values are the applicable criterion element in the absence of steady-state condition fish tissue data. In fishless waters, selenium concentrations in fish from the nearest downstream waters may be used to assess compliance using methods provided in Aquatic Life Ambient Water Quality Criterion for Selenium - Freshwater, EPA-822-R-16-006, Appendix K: Translation of a Selenium Fish Tissue Criterion Element to a Site-Specific Water Column Value (June 2016) . 4.Intermittent Exposure Equation= where WQC is the water column element, for either lentic or lotic waters; Cbkgrnd is the average background selenium concentration, and fint is the fraction of any 30-day period during which elevated selenium concentrations occur, with f int assigned a value 0.033 (corresponding to one day). s.

The criteria established in Section 210 are subject to the ge neral rules of applicability in the same way and to the same extent as are the other numeric chemical criteria when applied to the same use classifications. Mixing zones may be applied to toxic substance criteria subject to the limitations set forth in Section 060 and set out below. (3-25-16) a. For all waters for which the Department has determined mixing z ones to be applicable, the toxic substance criteria apply at the boundary of the mixing zone(s) and beyond.

Low flow design conditions. Water quality-based effluent limits and mixing zones for toxic substances shall be based on the following low flows in perenni al receiving streams. Numeric chemical criteria may be exceeded in perennial streams outside any applicable mixing zone only when flows are less than these values: (3-25-16) i. Where \"1Q10\" is the lowest one-day flow with an average recur rence frequency of once in ten (10) years determined hydrologically; (5-3-03) ii.

Application of aquatic life metals criteria. (3-25-16) i. For metals other than cadmium, for purposes of calculating ha rdness dependent aquatic life criteria from the equations in Subsection 210.02, the minimum hardness a llowed for use in those equations shall not be less than twenty-five (25) mg/l, as calcium carbonate, even if the a ctual ambient hardness is less than twenty-five (25) mg/ l as calcium carbonate. For cadmi um, the minimum hardness for u se in those equations shall not be less than ten (10) mg/l, as calcium carbonate. The maximum hardness allowed for us e in those equations shall not be greater than four hundred (400) mg/l, as calcium carbonate, except as specified i n Subsections 210.03.c.ii. and 210.03.c.iii., even if the actual ambient hardness is greater than four hundred (400) mg/l as calcium carbonate. (3-29-10) ii. The hardness values used for calculating aquatic life criter ia for metals at design discharge conditions shall be representative of the ambient hardnesses fo r a receiving water that occur at the design discharge conditions given in Subsection 210.03.b. (5-3-03) iii. Except as otherwise noted, the aquatic life criteria for me tals (compounds #1 through #13 in the criteria table of Subsection 210.02) are expressed as dissolved metal concentrations. Unle ss otherwise specified by the Department, dissolved concentrations are considered to be c oncentrations recovered from a sample which has passed through a forty-five hundredths (0.45) micron filter. Fo r the purposes of calculating aquatic life criteria for metals from the equations in footnotes e. and i. in the criteri a table in Subsection 210.01, the water effect ratio is computed as a specific pollutant's acute or chronic toxicity va lues measured in water from the site covered by the standard, divided by the respect ive acute or chronic toxicity value in laboratory dilution water. The water-effect ratio shall be assigned a value of one (1.0), except where the Depart ment assigns a different value that protects the designated uses of the water body from the toxic effects of the pollutant, and is derived from suitable tests on sampled water representative of conditions in the affected water body, consistent with the design discharge conditions established in Subsection 210.03.b. For purposes of calculating water effects ratios, the term acute toxicity value is the toxicity test results, such as the concentration lethal one -half (1/2) of the test organi sms (i.e., LC5O) after ninety- six (96) hours of exposure (e.g., fish toxicity tests) or the e ffect concentration to one-half of the test organisms, (i.e., EC5O) after forty-eight (48) hours of exposure (e.g., daphnia t oxicity tests). For purposes of calculating water effects ratios, the term chronic value is the result from appropriate hypothesis testing or regression analysis of measurements of growth, reproduction, or survival from life cycle, partial l ife cycle, or early life stage tests. The determination of acute and chronic values shall be according to current standard protocols (e.g., those published by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)) or other comparable m ethods. For calculation of criteria using site- specific values for both the hardness and the water effect rati o, the hardness used in the equations in Subsection 210.0 2 shall be as required in Subsection 210.03.c.ii. Water ha rdness shall be calculated from the measured calcium and magnesium ions present, and the ratio of calcium to magnesi um shall be approximately the same in laboratory toxicity testing water as in the site water, or be similar to a verage ratios of laboratory waters used to derive the criteria. (4-6-05) iv. Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria. (4-6-05) (1) The \"Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Qua lity Criteria\" describes in detail suggested methods for discharge related monitoring requirements , calculation of reasonable potential to exceed (RPTE) water quality criteria in determining need for mercury e ffluent limits, and use of fish tissue mercury data in calculating mercury load reductions. This guidance, or its upda tes, will provide assistance to the Department and the public when implementing the methylmercury criterion. The \"Impl ementation Guidan ce for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria\" also provides basic background information on mercury in the environment, the novelty of a fish tissue criterion for water quality, the connection between huma n health and aquatic life protection, and the relation of environmental programs outside of Clean Water Act programs to r educing mercury contamination of the environment. The \"Implementation Guidance for the Idaho Mercury Water Quality Criteria\" is available at the Department of Environmental Quality, 1410 N.

In applying the methylmercury fish tissue criterion in the context of NPDES effluent limits and TMDL load reductions, the Department will assume change in fish tissue concentrations of methylmercury are proportional to change in water body loading of total mercury. Reasonable potential to exceed (RPTE) the fish tissue criterion for existing NPDES sources will be based on measured fish tissue concentrati ons potentially affected by the discharge exceeding a specified threshold value, based on uncertainty due to measurement variability. This threshold v alue is also used for TMDL decisions. Because measured fish tissue concentrations do not reflect the effect o f proposed new or increased discharge of mercury, RPTE in these cases will be based upon an estimated fish tissue methylmercury concentration, using projected changes in waterbody loading of total mercury and a proportiona l response in fish tissue mercury. For the above purposes, mercury will be measured in the skinless filets of sp ort fish using techniques capable of detecting tissue concentrations down to point zero five (0.05) mg/kg. Total merc ury analysis may be used, but will be assumed to be all methylmercury for purposes of implementing the criterion. (4-6-05) d. Application of toxics criteria. (3-25-16) i. Frequency and duration for aquatic life toxics criteria. Colu mn B1 criteria are concentrations not to be exceeded for a one-hour average more than once in three (3) years. Column B2 criteria are concentrations not to be exceeded for a four-day average more than once in three (3) yea rs. (3-25-16) ii. Frequency and duration for human health toxics criteria. Col umns C1 and C2 criteria are not to be exceeded based on an annual harmonic mean. (3-25-16) 04. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permitting . For the purposes of NPDES permitting, interpretation and implementation of metals criteri a listed in Subsection 210.02 should be governed by the following standards, that are hereby incorporated by reference, in addition to other scientifically defensible methods deemed appropriate by the Department; provided, however, any id entified conversion factors within these documents are not incorporated by referen ce. Metals criteria conversion f actors are identified in Subsection 210.02 of this rule.

(3-25-1 6) ii. When using toxicity thresholds to derive water quality crite ria to protect human health, a fish consumption rate representative of the population to be protected, a mean adult body weight, an adult 90th percentile water ingestion rate, a trophic level weighted BAF or BCF, and a hazard quotient of one (1) for non-carcinogens or a cancer risk level of 10-5 for carcinogens shall be utilized.

Site-specific water column values (30-day average) are based on dissolved total selenium in water and are derived using a performance-based approach from fish tissue valu es via either the mechanistic modeling or empirical bioaccumulation factor (BAF) method in Aquatic Life Ambient Water Quality Criterion for Selenium - Freshwater, EPA-822-R-16-006, Appendix K: Translation of a Selenium Fish Tissue Criterion Element to a Site-Specific Water Column Value (June Blackfoot Subbasin Lanes and Diamond Creeks to Blackfoot Reservoir (unit US-10), and all tributaries thereof. The site-specific criterion for these water bodies is set out in the following table.Note: In 2016, Idaho updated human health criteria for 104 toxi c substances (10 of which are new). Final rule submitted to EPA on December 13, 2016 (docket 58-0102-1201). Un til EPA approves the revisions in this rule docket, the human health criteria published in 2005 Idaho Administrative Code in Section 210 continue to apply and are effective for CWA purposes. These criteria are li sted in Numeric Criteria for Toxic Substances (2005) . The previous human health criteria based on a fish consumption rate of 6.5 g/day published in 2005 Idaho Administrative Code in Section 210.05.b.i. continue to apply and are effective for CWA purposes. Until EPA approves the revisions in this rule docket, the addit ional fish-plus-water criterion for 210.03, 210.04, 210.05.b.ii. and 400.06; and the definition of harmonic mean pub - lished in 2015 Idaho Administrative Code continue to apply and are effective for CWA purposes.
