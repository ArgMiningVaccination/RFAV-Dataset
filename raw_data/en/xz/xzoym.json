THROUGH A SIMPLE PROCESS OF REFINEMENT THE ANIMAL, PLANT, MINERAL AND IMPONDERABLE SUBSTANCES USED TO MAKE HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINES ARE DILUTED AND POTENTISED BEYOND THE POINT OF CRUDE CHEMISTRY. THIS PROCESS IS WHERE HOMEOPATHY STANDS APART FROM CONVENTIONAL AND HERBAL MEDICINES. DILUTION & POTENTISATION In order to make a homeopathic medicine, a chosen substance is mixed with alcohol - let's take the plant Arnica as an example. The Arnica and alcohol solution or \"mother tincture\" represents the starting point from which the crude form of Arnica is transformed in to a homeopathic remedy, a process known as dilution and potentisation. Water is used to dilute the mother tincture in a sequence that is carried out with mathematical precision, each stage of this sequencing accompanied by a vigorous shaking of the solution - potentisation. The resulting effect is an imprinting of the Arnica's vital energy onto the [matrix of the water solution](https://www.formandheal.com/blog/thescienceofwater). The \"higher\" the dilution the less material particles remain. Dilution and potentisation renders the toxic components of the Arnica inert, transforming a would-be poison into a medicine capable of initiating a healing response on the dynamic level. Where Arnica in material form, such as the cream that might be applied to a bruise will help on the physical level, Arnica as a homeopathic remedy becomes a medicine with an expansive field of action. Working directly with the body's vital force Arnica has the capacity to not only heal the bruising, but to address the shock and bruised psyche. POTENCIES The number accompanying each homeopathic remedy followed by a roman numeral (X, C or M) indicates the number of times that a substance has been through the dilution and potentisation process. This number notes how removed it is from its crude origins; the lower more physical doses are the X potencies, the higher energetic potencies the C scale and the vibrationally higher still the M. Hence the further away from its original Arnica plant-state, the more the release of energy and the greater the depth at which the medicine will act. In order to stimulate the body's vital system we need to work on this dynamic plane - in homeopathy we are dealing with physics; energy, frequency and vibration. A QUESTION OF CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS Conventional medicine primarily seeks to understand the body's complexities through the analysing of its chemical components. In this way understanding disease is a process of reduction in which a solution can be found by breaking the issue down in to its smallest components - disease being essentially biochemical in nature requiring chemical interventions as solutions. The accomplishments in pursuit of this level of detail are extraordinary yet have been sort after to almost a singular degree. An antibiotic will \"kill\" the bacteria present during infection but it will not address the underlying susceptibility that has resulted in the infection to begin with. This is commonly seen in any recurrent infection - think of urinary tract, ear or throat conditions. Although the so-called \"offending bug\" is considered as having been killed the underlying susceptibility remains unaddressed. Conventional medicine's emphasis on what is physical and what can be seen herald Chemistry as King yet without the cohesive force of physics that initiates the interactions that bonds chemical to chemical, we would remain a collection of disconnected elements, a loose pile of lego bricks. Consider you have the perfect collection of chemical elements needed to make a grape, such as phosphorus, magnesium, iron, sodium and manganese. These ingredients in themselves will not result in the grapes creation, it is the energetic life force that animates these chemical components into bonding with intention and purpose. This intelligent and self-determining dynamic is the vital force and it is this force that integrates the physical, mental and emotional selves and is the very energy that enables one to heal. ENERGY HEALING Homeopathy endeavours to address the root cause of dis-ease, which for the most part bar most accidents or injuries, is an internal state and energetic in nature. Working at this energetic level is to heal at great depths - energetic medicine changes the very nature of the soil that predisposes us to developing specific types of disease. Fundamentally electromagnetic in nature in homeopathy we are working with energy and frequency. Once placed under the tongue the signal of, for instance \"Arnica 200C\" stimulates the self-healing mechanism in to action. In an Arnica-state we will observe the mitigation of internal bleeding, a calming of the inflammatory response, a rebalancing action on the blood and the space for the emotions and state of shock to be processed and resolved. With an understanding that the body's innate intelligence will manifest symptoms in its attempts to heal, rather than suppress these attempts homeopathy works with the body providing in order to provide it with more of the energy it is needing in order to heal. Their action is akin to the turning of the key in the ignition of the car in order to start the engine. It is your body that will decide how it uses this energy, a decision which will always be aligned towards healing. As Albert Einstein surmised, we are energy solidified and it is at this energetic and atomic level that homeopathy works. ABOUT HOMEOPATH PAILIN BRZESKI BSC(HONS) LCHE R.HOM.HINT.
