A contraindication is a situation where a vaccine should not be given as the risks outweigh any potential therapeutic benefit . A precaution is a condition that may increase the risk of an adverse event following immunization (AEFI) or compromise the ability of the vaccine to produce an immune response , which may result in deferral of immunization ; however , there may be circumstances where the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks from vaccination associated with the condition or where reduced immunogenicity still benefit s immunocompromised individuals (Canadian Immunization Guide ). In general, there are very few actual contraindications to Health Canada authorized COVID -19 vaccin es that would qualify as medical exemptions and most individuals can receive COVID -19 vaccine s. Only individuals with contraindications to mRNA and viral vector vaccines qualify for medical exemption. This document i s based on recommendations from Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) and expert clinician advice, prepared in consultation with Public Health Ontario and several specialist physicians with expertise in AEFIs. As the context and evidence on COVID -19 vaccines evolves, this guidance will be updated and individuals with medical exemptions should be periodically re-evaluated by their nurse practitioner/ physician/specialist as emerging evidence and new vaccine products become available. 3 | Page Reasons for Medical Exemption Individuals who have experienced serious adverse event s following COVID -19 immunization and those with certain medical conditions that may affect their immune response to immunization should be refer red to an appropriate physician or nurse practitioner based on their adverse event/medical condition for further assessment. This should include a detailed patient history, assessment of the adverse event/medical condition and investigations/diagnosis, individual ized risk- benefit analysis, and recommendations/ options for fu ture immunization. For serious or rare AEFI s, individuals should be thoroughly investigated to determine if the event can be attributed to an alternative etiology. Referral and specialist consultation support for physicians and nurse practitioners is available through Ontario's eConsult Service , OTN Hub , and the Special Immunization Clinic (SIC) Network . In many instances, safe administration of subsequent doses of COVI D-19 vaccine is possible under the management of a n appropriate physician or nurse practitioner . True medical exemptions are expected to be infrequent and should be supported by expert consultation. Tables 1 -4: Summary of conditions and/or adv erse events following immunization (AEFI) that may quali fy for a medical exemption to COVID -19 vaccination 4 | Page 1. Pre-existing Condition(s) 1 As per NACI if the diagnosis with myocarditis is remote and they are no longer followed clinically by a medical professional for cardiac issues, they should receive an mRNA COVID - 19 vaccine. Condition/AEFI Management Myocarditis prior to initiating an mRNA COVID - 19 vaccine series As per NACI , individuals with a history of myocarditis unrelated to mRNA COVID -19 vaccination should consult their clinical team for individual considerations and recommendations.1 Q ualifies for medical exemption if: o Discussion with appropriate physician or nurse practitioner has occurred on potential options for immunization with an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine; AND o Physician or nurse practitioner has determined that the individual is unable to receive any COVID -19 vaccine. Severe allergic reaction (including anaphylaxis) to a component of a COVID- 19 vaccine Qualifies for medical exemption only if: o Allergy was documented by an appropriate physician or nurse practitioner; AND o Discussion with an appropriate physician or nurse practitioner has occurred on potential options for immunization; AND o Physician or nurse practitioner has determined that the individual cannot receive any COVID- 19 vaccine with currently available mitigation strategies. Note: True medical exemptions are expected to be infrequent. In most instances, safe administration of subsequent doses of the COVID -19 vacci ne is possible under the management of an appropriate physician or nurse practitioner. 5 | Page 2. Contraindications to Initiating an AstraZeneca or Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine Series Condition/AEFI Management History of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) Series should be completed with an mRNA vaccine. Qualifies for medical exemption if: o Individual has medical exemption to completing their vaccine series with an mRNA vaccine. History of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with thrombocytopenia Series should be completed with an mRNA vaccine. Qualifies for medical exemption if: o Individual has medical exemption to completing their vaccine series with an mRNA vaccine. History of heparin -induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) Series should be completed with an mRNA vaccine. Qualifies for medical exemption if: o Individual has medical exemption to completing their vaccine series with an mRNA vaccine. History of major venous and/or arterial thrombosis with thrombocytopenia Series should be completed with an mRNA vaccine. Qualifies for medical exemption if: o Individual has medical exemption to completing their vaccine series with an mRNA vaccine. 6 | Page 3. Adverse Events Following COVID -19 Immunization2 Condition/AEFI Management Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)/VITT 3 following the AstraZeneca or Janssen COVID -19 vaccine Subsequent immunization should be completed with an mRNA vaccine. Qualifies for medical exemption only if: o Individual has medical exemption to completing their vaccine series with an mRNA vaccine. Myocarditis or Pericarditis following an mRNA COVID - 19 vaccine Qualifies for medical exemption if: o Myocarditis/pericarditis was diagnosed within 6 weeks of receiving a previous dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine after medical evaluation (e.g., ER physician, relevant specialist). This includes any person who had an abnormal cardiac investigation including electrocardiogram (ECG), elevated troponins, echocardiogram or cardiac MRI after a dose of an mRNA vaccine. In situations where there is uncertainty regarding myocarditis diagnosis, discussion should occur with appropriate physician or nurse practitioner on potential options for (re)immunization with the same or alternative COVID -19 vaccine. The individual qualifies for a medical exemption if the physician or nurse practitioner has determined that the individual is unable to receive any COVID -19 vaccine. Those with a history compatible with pericarditis and who either had no cardiac workup or had normal cardiac investigations, can be (re)immunized once they are symptom free and at least 90 days has passed since vaccination. For further details see page 12 2 AEFI is defined as any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the use of a vaccine. 3 Vaccine -Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT). 7 | Page Condition/AEFI Management Severe allergic reaction (including anaphylaxis) following a COVID -19 vaccine Qu alifies for medical exemption if: o Allergy was documented by an appropriate physician or nurse practitioner; AND o Discussion with appropriate physician or nurse practitioner has occurred on potential options for (re)immunization; AND o Physician or nurse practitioner has determined that the individual cannot receive any COVID -19 vaccine with currently available mitigation strategies. Note: True medical exemptions are expected to be infrequent. In most instances, safe administration of subsequent doses of the COVID -19 vaccine is possible under the management of an appropriate physician or nurse practitioner. Serious adverse event following COVID -19 immunization (e.g. , results in hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity) Qualifies for medical exemption if: o Event has been medically evaluated; AND o Discussion has occurred with an appropriate physician or nurse practitioner (e.g., immunologist, SIC network, Medical Officer of Health, etc.) on the individual's risks and benefits of potential options for immunization with the same or alternative COVID- 19 vaccine; AND o Physician or nurse practitioner has determined that the individual is unable to receive any COVID -19 vaccine. 8 | Page 4. Other Condition/AEFI Management Active ly receiving monoclonal antibody therapy OR convalescent plasma therapy for the treatment or prevention of COVID -19 Qualifies for time -limited medical exemption while they are a ctively receiving therapy . Actively receiving or recently completed immunosuppressing therapy anticipated to significantly blunt vaccine response Q ualifies for time -limited medical exemption if: o Appropriate physician or nurse practitioner has recommended that the individual defer vaccination to a later point to optimize immune response to COVID -19 vaccination; AND o The individual is actively receiving or recently completed one or more of the follow ing immunosuppressives: Anti-CD20 - vaccination deferral of up to 6 months following completion of therapy is recommended Anti-thymocyte globulin - vaccination deferral of up to 1 month is recommended following completion of therapy Chimeric Antigen Respo nse (CAR) T -cell therapy - vaccination deferral of up to 3 months is recommended following completion of therapy Hematopoietic stem cell transplant - vaccination deferral of up to 3 months is recommended following completion of therapy Prednisone >=1mg/kg - vaccination deferral of up to 1 month is recommended following completion of therapy 9 | Page 1. Pre-existing Condition (s) History of Myocarditis prior to initiating an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine series Individuals who have a history of myocarditis unrelated to mRNA COVID -19 vaccination should consult their clinical team for individual considerations and recommendations. Individuals previously diagnosed with myocarditis, whose diagnosis is considered remo te and are no longer followed clinically by a medical professional for cardiac issues should receive the vaccine. This guidance is issued by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) . A medical exemption may be issued only if discussion has occurred with a n appropriate physician or nurse practitioner regarding potential opti ons for immunization with an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine or alternative, and the physician or nurse practitioner has determined that the individual cannot receive any COVID -19 vaccine. History of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis to any component of a COVID-19 vaccine Individuals with a confirmed severe, immediate (4h following exposure) allergy (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a component of a specific COVID -19 vaccine or its container (e.g., PEG) , are recommended to consult with an appropriate physician or nur se practitioner before receiving the specific COVID -19 vaccine. Individuals who are allergic to tromethamine (found in the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine and pediatric Pfizer -BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine ) should be offered the Pfizer -BioNTech COVID - 19 vaccine if 12 years or age or older, which does not contain this exc ipient. Individuals who are allergic to polysorbates (found in viral vector vaccines), should be offered an mRNA vaccine. A medical exemption may be issued only if discussion has occurred with the appr opriate physician or nurse practitioner on options for immunization with the COVID- 19 vaccine, including a risk -benefit analysis for the individual, and the physician or nurse practitioner has determined that the individual cannot receive any COVID -19 vaccine. For a comprehensive list of components in the vaccine and packaging, please consult the product leaflet or information contained within the product monograph available through Health Canada's Drug Product Database . 10 | Page 2. Contraindications to Initiating an AstraZeneca or Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine Series History of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) Individuals who have experienced episodes of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) should not receive the AstraZeneca or Janssen COVID -19 vaccine. Very rare cases of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) have been reported following immunization with the AstraZeneca COVID- 19 vaccine . This is a contraindication to receiving the AstraZeneca or Janssen COVID -19 vaccine . An authorized COVID- 19 vaccine using a different platform (i.e. , mRNA) should be offered for immunization. A medical exemption may be issued only if an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine is contraindicated for the individual. History of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) with thrombocytopenia Individuals who have experienced a previous CVST with thrombocytopenia should not receive the AstraZeneca or Janssen C OVID -19 vaccine. This is a contraindication to receiving the AstraZeneca or Janssen COVID -19 vaccine . An authorized COVID -19 vaccine using a different platform (i.e. , mRNA) should be offered for immunization. A medical exemption may be issued only if an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine is contraindicated for the individual. History of heparin- induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) Individuals who have experienced a HIT should not receive the AstraZeneca or Janssen COVID -19 vaccine. This is a contraindication to receiving th e AstraZeneca or Janssen COVID -19 vaccine . An authorized COVID- 19 vaccine using a different platform (i.e. , mRNA) should be offered for immunization. A medical exemption may be issued only if mRNA COVID -19 vaccine is contraindicated for the individual. History of major venous and/or arterial thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following any vaccine Individuals who have experienced major venous and/or arterial thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following vaccination wi th any vaccine should not receive the AstraZeneca or Janssen COVID -19 vaccine . This is a contraindication based on recommendations issued by Ontario's Vaccine Clinical Advisory Group on Immunization . An authorized COVID -19 vaccine using a different platfor m (i.e., mRNA) should be offered for immunization. A medical exemption may be issued only if an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine is contraindicated for the individual. 11 | Page 3. Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) with COVID -19 vaccine Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)/VITT following AstraZeneca or Janssen COVID- 19 vaccine Individuals who have experienced a major venous or arterial thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following vaccination with AstraZeneca or Janssen COVID -19 vaccine are contraindicated to receiving the AstraZeneca or Janssen vaccine . An authorized COVID- 19 vaccine using a different platform (i.e. mRNA) should be offered for subsequent immunization. A medical exemption may be issued only if they have a medical exemption to completing their s eries with an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine. Myocarditis/Pericarditis following mRNA COVID -19 vaccination A medical exemption may be issued if myocarditis/pericarditis was diagnosed after medical evaluation (e.g., ER physician, relevant specialist). In most circumstances, and as a precautionary measure until more information is available, i ndividuals with a diagnosed episode of myocarditis/pericarditis within 6 weeks of receipt of a previous dose of an mRNA COVID -19 vaccine should defer further doses of the vaccine. This includes any person who had an abnormal cardiac investigation including electrocardiogram (ECG), elevated troponins, echocardiogram or cardiac MRI after a dose of an mRNA vaccine. This is a precaution based on recommendations issued by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) . NACI, Public Health Ontario (PHO), and the Ontario Ministry of Health (MOH) are following this closely and will update this recommendation as more evidence becomes available. In situations where there is uncertainty regarding myocarditis diagnosis, discussion should occur with an appropriate physician or nurse practitioner on potential options for (re)immunization with the same or alternative COVID- 19 vaccine, including a risk - benefit analysis for the individual. The individual qualifies for a medical exemption if the physician or nurse practitioner has determined that the individual is unable to receive any COVID -19 vaccine. Those with a history compatible with pericarditis and who either had no cardiac workup or had normal cardiac investigations, can be re(immunized) once they are symptom free and at least 90 days has passed since vaccination. Some people with confirmed myocarditis and/or pericarditis may choose to receive another dose of vaccine after discussing the risks and benefits with their healthcare provider . Individuals can be revaccinated once they are symptom free and at least 90 days has passed since vaccination. If another dose of 12 | Page vaccine is offered, they should be offered the Pfizer -BioNTech 30 mcg vaccine due to the lower reported rate of myocarditis and/or pericarditis following the Pfizer - BioNTech 30mcg vaccine compared to the Moderna 100 mcg vaccine. Informed consent should include discussion about the unkno wn risk of recurrence of myocarditis and/or pericarditis following receipt of additional doses of Pfizer - BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine in individuals with a history of confirmed myocarditis and/or pericarditis after a previous dose of mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine, as well as the need to seek immediate medical assessment and care should symptoms develop. Severe Allergic Reaction or Anaphylaxis following a COVID- 19 vaccine In individuals with a history of a severe, immediate (4h following vaccination) allergic reactio n (e.g., anaphylaxis) after previous administration of an mRNA COVID- 19 vaccine, re -vaccination (i.e. administration of a subsequent dose in the series when indicated) may be offered with the same vaccine or the same mRNA platform if a risk assessment deem s that the benefits outweigh the potential risks for the individual and if informed consent is provided. The risk of a severe immediate allergic reaction after re -immunization appears to be low and no long -term morbidity has been associated with re -vaccina tion. Consultation with an allergist may be sought prior to re -vaccination. If re-vaccinated, vaccine administration should be done in a controlled setting with expertise and equipment to manage allergic reactions . Individuals should be observed for at lea st 30 minutes after re -vaccination. For example, a longer period of observation is warranted for individuals exhibiting any symptom suggestive of an evolving AEFI at the end of the 30 minute observation period. For those with a previous history of allergy to an mRNA vaccine, re -vaccination with an mRNA vaccine is preferred over a viral vector vaccine due to the better effectiveness and immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines and the possible adverse effects specifically associated with viral vector vaccines (e.g., Vaccine -Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT), capillary Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) ). In individuals with a history of a severe, immediate (4h following vaccination) allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after previous administration of a viral vector COVID -19 vaccine, re -vaccination may be offered with an mRNA platform if a risk assessment deems that the benefits outweigh the potential risks for the individual and if informed consent is provided. If re -vaccinated, individuals should be observed for at least 30 minutes after re -vaccination. 13 | Page A medical exemption may be issued if discussion has occurred with an appropriate physician or nurse practitioner on potential options for (re)immunization with the same or alternative COVID- 19 vaccine , including a risk -benefit analysis for the indivi dual, and the physician or nurse practitioner has determined that the individual cannot receive any COVID -19 vaccine with the currently available mitigation strategies . Other allergies Individuals with other types of non- severe allergies can receive COVID -19 vaccines as outlined in the MOH's Vaccination Recommendations for Special Populations . These allergies do not on their own constitute the ground s for a medical exemption . For more information on the management of individuals with allergies , please see the MOH's Vaccination Recommendations for Special Populations. Serious Adverse Event Following COVID-19 Immunization (AEFI) Individuals who experience a serious adverse ev ent following immunization (AEFI) (e.g., hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity) with a COVID -19 vaccine should be medically assessed by an appropriate physician or nurse practitioner , and the event should be reported to their loc al public health unit (PHU). This may include clinical syndromes such as Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). The Health Protection and Promotion Act (HPPA) mandates reporting of AEFIs by healthcare providers who administer immunizations (e.g., registered nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and physicians). AEFI reports received by PHUs are investigated, assessed, and documented according to provincial surveillance guidelines, as required by the Ontario Public Health Standards (OPHS) . For se rious AEFI s, this include s referral to an appropriate physician or nurse practitioner for diagnosis/management and expert assessment for recommendation for subsequent immunization (e.g., the Special Immunization Clinic (SIC) Network , immunologist , etc.). This assessment will include a detailed assessment of the adverse event including investigations and diagnosis, and assessment for alternative etiology for the event. Discussion with the patient should then consider the event and the personal and epidemio logical context (in terms of risk of COVID -19 infection) for the patient , and the risks and benefit s regarding recommendations/options for immunization. The individual qualifies for a medical exemption if the appropriate physician or nurse practitioner (e.g., immunologist, SIC network, Medical Officer of Health, etc.) determines that the individual is unable to receive any COVID -19 vaccine after the event has been medically evaluated AND a 14 | Page discussion has occurred on the individual's risks and benefits of po tential options for immunization with the same or alternative COVID- 19 vaccine . There are very few serious AEFIs that would result in a medical exemption to COVID -19 vaccination. 4. Other Actively receiving monoclonal antibody or convalescent plasma therapy for the treatment or prevention of COVID -19 disease Individuals who are actively receiving monoclonal antibody or convalescent plasma therapy for the treatment or prevention of COVID- 19 disease should not receive a COVID -19 vaccine (NACI) . This is a time -limited (temporary) precaution. COVID -19 vaccines may be administered to these individuals once therapy is discontinued, with the timing of administration and potential for immune interference evaluated on a case -by-case basis by a n appropriate physician or nurse practition er. A medical exemption may be issued only if the individual is actively receiving therapy. Actively receiving or recently completed immunosuppressing therapy anticipated to significantly blunt vaccine response Individuals who are actively receiving or recently completed an immunosuppressive therapy listed in the table below may be advised by their physician or nurse practitioner to defer COVID -19 vaccination to a later point to optimize immune response to the COVID -19 vaccine and minimize delays in management of their underlying condition . This is a time -limited (temporary) precaution . The recommended maximum deferral duration following completion of specific therapies is listed in the table below. COVID -19 vaccines may be administered to these individuals once therapy is discontinued, with timing of administration evaluated on a case -by-case basis by a n appropriate physician or nurse practitioner . Discussion with the patient should then consider the ir medical condition and the personal and epidemiological context (in terms of risk of COVID -19 infection) for the patient, and the risks and benefits regarding timing and recommendations/options for immunization. A time -limited medical exemption may be issued only if the appropriate physician or nurse practitioner has recommended that the individual defer COVID -19 vaccination to a later point to optimize their immune response . 15 | Page Table 5: Recommended COVID -19 vaccination deferral duration following completion of specific therapies I mmunosuppressive Therapy Recommended Maximum Deferral Duration Following Completion of Therapy Anti-CD20 6 months Anti-thymocyte globulin 1 month Chimeric antigen response (CAR) t -cell therapy 3 months Hematopoietic stem cell transplant 3 months Prednisone >=1mg/kg 1 month "}
