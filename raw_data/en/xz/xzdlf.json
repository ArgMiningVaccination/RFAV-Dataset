A report based on the Breast Cancer Now Access to Medicines Summit held in January 2016We nd ourselves entering a new era of uncertainty in terms of patient access to cancer drugs.Foreword 4 5Since 2011, the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) has given patients in England what they were so desperate for - access to many life-extending drugs not otherwise available on the NHS. Over 95,000 families received an invaluable lifeline, resulting in precious extra moments, months and even years together. But now the CDF as we know it is ending and we nd ourselves entering a new era of uncertainty in terms of patients being able to access cancer drugs. The need for more effective treatments remains. Considering breast cancer alone, around 11,500 women in the UK die of the disease every year - that's nearly 1,000 deaths every single month. These are mothers, sisters and daughters that desperately need the best cancer treatments to be fast-tracked into the NHS. Yet a multitude of barriers continue to prevent breast cancer patients from accessing new drugs. The scale of the problem is considerable - not a single new breast cancer drug was approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) technology appraisal between 2007 and 2016. The original CDF helped circumvent this barrier to access to a notable extent, but it was never intended to be a permanent solution. Rather, it was designed to be a temporary measure while the NICE drug appraisal system was reformed through the introduction of value-based pricing. But the plans for value-based pricing were not introduced and no alternative has taken its place. This report comes at a time when patients are waiting to discover the impact of the new CDF. All drugs available on the old CDF will be reappraised, with NICE back in the driving seat. Promising drugs will only be recommended for the new CDF if it is possible and useful to collect extra data on the drug's effectiveness. It remains to be seen whether the NICE process - that has not been working for cancer patients and that has seen only limited reform - will enable the access to life-extending treatments that so many patients depend on. Identifying a problem is never enough, and to this end the Summit was an incredibly encouraging and thought-provoking gathering; one that demonstrated a range of ideas and possibilities to x this broken system. We're extremely grateful to our colleagues from NICE, NHS England, the pharmaceutical industry, fellow patient representative organisations and academia for joining together to provide their advice, expertise and perspectives, and for making this report possible. We hope this publication continues the conversation to ensure the best new cancer medicines are made available to NHS patients. But while bringing everyone to the same table is an important rst step, we must all now continue the dialogue and the report highlights areas where further research and action is needed to ensure progress for patients. At Breast Cancer Now, we will continue to work with all stakeholders to identify areas of consensus. We very much hope that, together, tangible and sustainable solutions to improve the drug appraisal system - for the bene t of cancer patients - can be found. Delyth Morgan Chief Executive, Breast Cancer Now Breast Cancer Now is the UK's largest breast cancer charity, dedicated to funding ground-breaking research into the disease. Our ambition is that if we all act now, by 2050 everyone who develops breast cancer will live. We're bringing together all those affected by the disease to improve the way we prevent, detect, treat and stop breast cancer. And we're committed to working with the NHS and governments across the UK to ensure that breast cancer services are as good as they can be, and that breast cancer patients bene t from advances in research as quickly as possible. Breast Cancer Now was formed following the merger of Breakthrough Breast Cancer and Breast Cancer Campaign. Both legacy charities had a strong focus on research, including investing in scienti c work to speed up the development of effective medicines for breast cancer. The speed of adoption of new medicines in the NHS and patient access to effective treatments is therefore one of the key priorities for Breast Cancer Now. Acknowledgements We would like to thank everyone who attended the Breast Cancer Now Access to Medicines Summit, held in January 2016. The content of this report is Breast Cancer Now's interpretation of the discussions that took place at the Summit and therefore the ndings will not necessarily refl ect the views of everyone who attended the event. Throughout this report we have supplemented the comments recorded during the event with a variety of examples and research, to explore some of the themes from the Summit's discussions in more detail. This report and the Access to Medicines Summit event were entirely funded by Breast Cancer Now and published in September 2016. This report was written by Tamara Sandoul of Breast Cancer Now. About the Summit 7Contents 607 081012 18 24 28 30The Breast Cancer Now Access to Medicines Summit was held on 26 January 2016. The event brought together a range of experts and key stakeholders on access to medicines. Attendees discussed possible solutions on how the availability of medicines could be improved for the bene t of NHS patients. The Summit was attended by 18 participants and took place under the Chatham House Rule, to enable free and open discussion of issues surrounding access to medicines.Participants included representatives from: \u0081 NHS England and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) \u0081 Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), Roche, P zer and Eisai Europe \u0081 Charity and patient representative organisations, including Prostate Cancer UK, Breast Cancer Now, Myeloma UK and Pancreatic Cancer UK \u0081 Academia, including from UCL School of Pharmacy \u0081 An independent economist and policy expertThe event was comprised of two sessions, with participants split up into three groups and a balance of stakeholder types in each group. In the rst session, groups were asked to discuss one of three broad topics: pricing of medicines, the Health Technology Assessment processes and patient involvement during the medicine assessment. The structure of this report follows the detailed discussions recorded at each of the tables, with sections one, two and three, approximately representing each of the groups. During the second session, groups were asked to design a new drug appraisal system, which would be t for purpose when assessing current and future medicines. The groups were given freedom to focus on any aspects of the system. Each group had a facilitator and a note-taker to record some of the key points that came out of the discussions. About the Summit Executive summary Context Section one: Reviewing the role of Health Technology Assessments Section two: Scope for fl exible pricing Section three: Meaningful patient involvement Next steps AppendixNICE Health technology appraisal methodology International comparisons Quality of LifeGeneric comparators Value Weighting patient experienceChanges in cancer treatments Price negotiation End of life and rarer conditionsAccess to medicines in the nations Multi-indication pricingAn innovation fund for all conditionsExecutive summary 8 9Reviewing the role and process of NICE Participants from all sectors highlighted the need for a full review of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE) processes, to ensure that the system is still working for the bene t of patients and the NHS, as well as having the full con dence of all stakeholders. Many participants noted the launch of more targeted cancer treatments over the past decade, especially for breast cancer, and the relative lack of change to NICE processes to refl ect these developments. Some participants suggested that a wider range of criteria should feed into the nal decision on a new medicine, especially for cases where overall survival data may not be available. Summit participants highlighted several examples of barriers and inequities in the current drug appraisal system, including the effect of comparing new treatments to generic or branded medicines. Participants also discussed equity of access to cancer treatments across the four UK nations, which has not been consistent. Participants questioned whether a fund for innovative medicines should be made available for all conditions and across the four nations to ensure that access is more equitable going forward.Scope for more fl exible pricing A variety of perspectives were shared on the issue of fair pricing for medicines. All stakeholders agreed that this was a particularly dif cult area, as the pharmaceutical industry and government of cials come from very different starting points. The possibility of price negotiation, either by NICE or another body, was mentioned extensively by attendees as a way of giving every drug the best chance of being made routinely available. Some pharmaceutical industry representatives noted that the true value of a medicine can sometimes be dif cult to ascertain at the outset, either by NICE or the pharmaceutical company, and that the price for a medicine should remain fl exible after the initial NICE appraisal. This might reduce some of the risks of appraisal and ensure there is a route for adjustments to be made. Some participants mentioned that the UK could learn from international systems of drug approval. For example, multi-indication pricing is used in countries such as France 1, whereby one medicine can be priced at different levels to refl ect the effectiveness and value of a medicine for each particular use. Meaningful patient experience All Summit attendees agreed that patient involvement was hugely important. This report discusses some of the points raised in more detail, suggesting how patient involvement could in practice be made more meaningful and what pitfalls each approach might carry. Quality of life measures are already an essential part of clinical trials and this data is compulsory for a NICE appraisal, yet participants noted that it rarely made any difference to the nal decision on a medicine's availability. The same was said of the involvement of patient experts in NICE Committees - participants questioned whether there is currently a mechanism by which patient involvement can infl uence the nal decision. Medicines for end of life (EOL) and rarer conditions can be approved by NICE at a higher cost than other medicines, yet the criteria for EOL de nes life expectancy as two years, which risks excluding several terminal cancers. Breast cancer patients survive on average for longer from a metastatic diagnosis than many other cancers, so fall outside of the EOL criteria. Conversely, pancreatic cancer patients have very short survival time from diagnosis, so medicines which can increase survival by a third also fall outside this criteria, because the increase in survival is deemed too short to meet EOL criteria.The Summit brought together stakeholders from all sectors, including patient representative organisations, to discuss some of the complex issues involved in making decisions about the availability of innovative cancer medicines for NHS patients. Attendees also looked at how the system should evolve in the future. Using the ideas, suggestions and discussions recorded at the Summit, this report explores areas where the current system could be improved and identi es points in the drug appraisal process, which would bene t from increased fl exibility. Breast cancer medicines are used as an example to illustrate some of the dif culties medicines face in being approved for routine use on the NHS. The themes below were the three main areas of discussion at the Summit and make up the structure of this report.Context 10 11NICE makes decisions on whether new medicines should be made routinely available to patients on the NHS. The Health Technology Assessment (HTA) process was designed in 1999 and takes into account both clinical and cost effectiveness of new medicines. In England, the NHS is required to fund treatments recommended by NICE, with Wales and Northern Ireland also largely using NICE recommendations to make decisions on the availability of medicines. Scotland conducts its own appraisals of medicines, with the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) leading this process. This report comes amid a period of change. The CDF played a fundamental role between 2010 and 2016 in providing access to new medicines for over 95,000 cancer patients 2. Some of the medicines available on the CDF had never been appraised by NICE, whilst others had been rejected for a variety of reasons. At the time of writing this report, the CDF is being re-structured and its purpose is changing from a fund providing patients with access to medicines otherwise unavailable on the NHS, to a fund aimed at lling in key evidence gaps on potentially cost-effective medicines. NICE and Cancer Drugs Fund timeline Attention is now turning back to NICE and its HTA processes as all medicines from the old CDF, as well as any new cancer medicines, are once again due to be appraised by NICE. Yet, with the exception of the EOL criteria introduced in around 2009 3, NICE's drug assessment process has not been signi cantly updated since 1999. The Value Based Assessment process, which was the planned successor to the current drug evaluation process has been halted inde nitely. It therefore seems an appropriate time to consider whether NICE needs further reform to ensure that effective cancer medicines in the future are likely to be approved for use in the NHS. Much more is known about cancer now than in 1999 and new treatments are refl ecting this new knowledge. New cancer medicines have contributed to longer survival rates 4 and these new treatments provide better quality of life for patients than traditional chemotherapies. 5,6,7 Yet, the smaller number of patients that more targeted medicines are set to bene t is one of the reasons why prices may be set at higher levels than ever before. It is expected that the Government-commissioned Accelerated Access Review (AAR), due to be published in summer 2016, will seek to speed up the adoption of innovative treatments and medicines in the NHS. However, it is still unclear what kind of recommendations the AAR will make and to what extent these will be adopted in practice. This report is not intended to be a conclusive set of recommendations on how all problems with access to new medicines could be solved. Instead, it is presented as a discursive paper which aims to shed light on some of the views held by key stakeholders and to nd areas where some fl exibility could be introduced into the process of assessing new medicines. It is intended that policy makers use this report as a starting point to consider how a drug appraisal system in a developed country needs to evolve over time to ensure that it remains effective at ful lling its key purpose - to provide patients with access to medicines as soon as practically possible - whilst reducing the obstacles that exist between the competing interests of government and the pharmaceutical industry.1999 2009 2010 20162011 2014-16NICE is established and the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) threshold for cost-effective medicines is introduced to help the organisation assess new medicines and make recommendations on their use in the NHS. New criteria are introduced for medicines used at the end of life (EOL) and for rarer cancers, with a higher QALY threshold. The criteria also stated that the indication should bene t no more than 7,000 patients, provide at least three months of extra overall survival and be intended for use in patients who are estimated to be less than two years away from death. An interim Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) is introduced to provide a source of funding for cancer medicines which have not been through the NICE process or have not been approved for routine use by NICE. Work on the development of a Value Based Assessment system gets underway but is shelved in 2014 following lack of agreement from different stakeholders on some of the more radical proposals. The CDF is overspent several years in a row despite its budget being increased and undergoing two rounds of de-listing of drugs in 2015.The CDF is formally established. The CDF is reformed and set to be launched on 1 July 2016. All cancer drugs still on the old CDF, as well as any new drugs, are again assessed by NICE. Changes to EOL criteria removes the cap of 7,000 patients.Section one 12Summit participants were asked to discuss the NICE Health Technology Assessment (HTA) system. Prompt questions included whether there were any examples of how the system was currently not working well, how medicines are appraised in other countries, how elements of international systems could be adopted in the UK and what effect this would have on access in the UK nations. The sub-sections on the following pages explore in more detail some the discussions that took place under this theme.Reviewing the role of Health Technology Assessments14 15Section one: Reviewing the role of Health Technology Assessments Section one: Reviewing the role of Health Technology Assessment s NICE Health Technology Assessment methodology The 2015 CDF consultation was underway during the Summit event and, as a result, many participants highlighted that the proposed reforms of the NICE HTA processes were not wide-ranging enough to ensure cancer medicines would have a fair chance of being approved. No new breast cancer medicines have been approved via a NICE technology appraisal since 2007, although several drugs were approved as part of NICE treatment guideline update in 2009 8,9,10. Five more indications are due to be appraised over the next 12 months. Participants mentioned that whilst high prices charged by pharmaceutical companies is one possible reason for the rejection of medicines for breast and other types of cancer, it is not the only factor. There was consensus from participants that a review of the whole system is needed to ensure that new medicines are appraised in a way that increases access to clinically-effective medicines for patients. A new drug appraisal system would also need the con dence of all stakeholders to function well.NICE technology appraisal decisions and upcoming appraisals 2007-2017 Jan-07Gemzar (gemcitabine) for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer is approved by NICE Feb-11Avastin (bevacizumab) (in combination with taxane) for metastatic breast cancer is rejected by NICE Dec-11Faslodex (fulvestrant) for the treatment of ER+ advanced or metastatic breast cancer is rejected by NICE Apr-12Halaven (eribulin) for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer is rejected by NICE Jun-12Tyverb (lapatinib) or Herceptin (trastuzumab) in combination with the rst-line treatment of metastatic ER+ and HER+ breast cancer is rejected by NICE Aug-12Avastin (bevacizumab) (in combination with cepecitabine) for metastatic breast cancer rejected by NICE Aug-13A nitor (everolimus) for HER2- ER+ advanced breast by NICE Aug-13Perjeta (pertuzumab) for metastatic HER2+ emtansine) for May-16 Perjeta (pertuzumab) (neoadjuvant) for primary HER2+ Aug-16A for cancer** for cancer**Generic comparators Delegates pointed out that no new medicines could hope to compete on price against existing treatments, where these are generic medicines. When NICE calculates the cost effectiveness of a new treatment, it works out the additional bene t of the medicine being appraised compared to standard NICE-recommended treatments for a condition and then uses the price difference between the two treatments to see whether the bene t justi es the cost. Whilst this calculation is designed to get the best deal for the NHS, participants highlighted that this is problematic in practice for a number of reasons. Firstly, the price difference between generic and branded medicines is stark, ranging from a few pounds per treatment to thousands of pounds per treatment for a branded medicine. Although advances in cancer medicines tend to be incremental, the clinical bene t of a new medicine would have to be much higher than that of the standard treatment to justify a positive decision. Some delegates argued that the scale of bene t needed for a new branded medicine to be recommended, instead of an existing generic comparator, is not in line with previous clinical improvements seen in new cancer medicines. This is particularly problematic for types of cancers where few new medicines are launched.The second concern with having a generic comparator occurs when one disease or indication has a branded comparator, whilst another indication has a generic comparator. This could then result in different likelihoods of medicines being approved for one condition compared to another. This can create inequalities between different conditions, depending on what treatment is already available for the indication. In breast cancer, the standard treatments are often generic, meaning that new cancer medicines do not seem cost-effective. Changes in cancer treatment Participants noted that our increasing knowledge of cancer over the past 15 years has led to much more targeted medicines being launched. This presents a number of technical challenges to the way medicine appraisals have traditionally worked. For example, the routine treatment for breast cancer involves surgery in the rst instance, as long as this is feasible, followed by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to increase the chance that all the cancer is eliminated and does not go on to spread to other parts of the body. However, medicines designed to be given to patients before surgery - neoadjuvant medicines - seem to be effective for breast cancer. Perjeta in the neoadjuvant setting, which was launched in the UK in July 2015 11, completely eradicated the cancer of some patients in the NeoSphere Phase II trial, thus removing the need for surgery. There has also been further analysis done to establish the links between the complete response rates observed as part of this trial and the effect of this on progression free survival. 12 However, NICE will usually only accept overall survival data as robust enough to warrant a positive recommendation. Long term survival data for neoadjuvant medicines could take at least 15 years to collect in the case of breast cancer which can recur and spread many years after an initial diagnosis, raising a question of how these new types of medicines, targeting such an early part of the disease pathway, can hope to achieve a positive recommendation and what other types of evidence might be able to show effectiveness in these cases. NICE must use other types of evidence when it assesses the effectiveness of medicines for long term conditions other than cancer, where overall survival would take a very long time to collect. Furthermore, despite the fact that more medicines such as Perjeta are being shown to be effective when given in combination with other treatments, NICE's cost effectiveness threshold will treat combinations of medicines as one treatment and will therefore expect the combined price of both medicines to meet the single cost effectiveness threshold. Approved Rejected Undecided * A nal decision has not been published at the time of writing this report. ** These medicines are being assessed by NICE as part of the CDF re-appraisal process.16 17Section one: Reviewing the role of Health Technology Assessments Section one: Reviewing the role of Health Technology Assessment s Access to medicines in the nations The power to decide on the availability of a medicine is devolved to the nations of the UK, so some variation in access to treatments may be expected across the UK. 13,14 The majority of Summit participants agreed that patient access to innovative medicines varies greatly between the nations, with reports of patients being forced to travel across borders for treatment. 15 Over the past ve years, English cancer patients have had much greater access to medicines due to the CDF, with the Fund providing access to medicines which were either not recommended by NICE or could not be assessed for various reasons. The nations, with the exception of Scotland, tend to follow NICE recommendations on most medicines. In Scotland several breast cancer drugs have been assessed and recommended for use, including Halaven (eribulin), A nitor (everolimus) 16 and Faslodex (fulvestrant), which were not recommended by NICE. 17 Wales has recently taken decisions on the availability of certain medicines which go against NICE recommendations, including Halaven (eribulin) 18 and A nitor (everolimus).19 Wales has also committed to introducing a New Treatments Fund for innovative medicines. 20,21 At the time of writing this report, an independent review of the decision making process surrounding new medicines in Scotland is being taken forward by Dr Brian Montgomery. This is the second time that processes have been reviewed since 2013. 22 Scotland has also set up its own New Medicines Fund within the last two years, which is largely used to fund independent treatment requests. It is clear that NICE needs to be reviewed for the bene t of both English patients and the rest of the UK. Whilst the system in Scotland can be improved, it has shown that by holding regular reviews, involving all key stakeholders, a medicines assessment system can ensure that it is to date with new types of medicines and good practice from around the world and responsive to the needs of patients and their values. Progression free survival NICE's HTA uses quality of life together with overall survival to assess the clinical effectiveness of a medicine, with the cost effectiveness of a medicine worked out from the difference in bene t and in price between current treatment and the new medicine. 23 However, even for metastatic breast cancer, when a medicine is given to a patient as a rst line treatment, it can take many years to collect overall survival data. And the more effective a medicine is, the longer this data might take to collect, as patients would be living longer. This issue is more pronounced in medicines given earlier in the cancer pathway and for cancers with longer survival rates, where overall survival data can take decades to be collected. Progression-free survival (the time it takes before a patient's cancer progresses) is often an earlier indication of the effectiveness of a new medicine. However, this measure is not necessarily equivalent to overall survival bene t and participants mentioned that NICE has no agreed standard way of translating progression-free survival data into predicted overall survival. In practice, this usually means that that a treatment with only progression-free survival data will receive a very small QALY gain, compared to a treatment where overall survival data is available. Some pharmaceutical companies mentioned that, paradoxically, when a treatment is shown to increase the time it takes for a cancer to progress, the cost effectiveness of the treatment becomes worse. An innovation fund for all conditions Some Summit participants highlighted that schemes like the CDF should be extended to patients affected by all types of long term conditions, instead of being available exclusively for cancer patients.This may be especially relevant for the new CDF, for which promising new drugs will be recommended to generate real world data, helping to ll any evidence gaps which may be preventing a drug from being routinely available. 24 Participants pointed out that a fund designed to bene t patients from all conditions would be more likely to become a permanent part of the system, rather than a temporary xture which is vulnerable to political and economic changes. There are already parts of the system that are designed for both cancers and long term conditions. Some Summit attendees mentioned that although the EOL criteria for NICE was developed for all rare conditions, in practice it is primarily used for cancer medicines. Even between cancer patients there are often inequalities in access to medicines. Differences in patient population size, budgetary impact of a drug and the variety of alternative treatment options vary greatly between medicines for rare and common cancer types. Even for common cancers, like breast cancer, the different sub-types have very different treatment options. It is not clear how these differences should be balanced fairly amongst all the patient populations or whether medicines to treat long-term conditions should be assessed differently from those used to treat cancer. For example, a requirement to show an improvement in overall survival would not be appropriate for many long term conditions, as the data would take decades to collect in some cases. There may need to be more alignment between assessment requirements between the different types of drugs for a joint fund to be feasible.Section two 18The mechanism for agreeing appropriate prices for medicines was the second major topic participants were asked to discuss at the Summit. Attendees were asked to consider whether there are any existing examples of fl exible pricing arrangements used in the UK or abroad, what the possible bene ts and barriers of fl exible pricing would be, as well as how this could be practically introduced into the current NICE appraisal system. Breast Cancer Now has supplemented the discussions recorded on this topic with some contextual information and examples.Scope for fl exible pricing Section two: two: Scope for fl exible pricing 20 21International comparisons Some attendees to the Summit highlighted that the UK spends less on branded medicines as a proportion of its GDP compared to most other developed countries. An ABPI-funded report produced by the Of ce of Health Economics in 2011 suggested that the total medicines bill in the UK represented 0.9 per cent of GDP compared to an average of 1.7 per cent for Germany, Italy, Spain, USA, France and Japan. 25 Since then, it seems that our spending on cancer medicines has caught up with the other European countries, but we have not necessarily bene tted as much as we should. A recently published paper suggests that the UK drug spend has increased by seven per cent per year, averaged from data collected between 2004 and 2014. This is the biggest increase, along with Germany, from the list of developed countries studied. The paper also found that the UK gained around \u00a314billion of net economic bene t from cancer medicines in that decade. However, other countries such as Japan, Germany, France and the US all recorded a higher net economic bene t from their cancer medicines spend. 26 However, the NHS is legally obliged to fund and resource medicines and treatments recommended by NICE HTAs 27, which puts NICE in a unique position of responsibility. Recent reports that many Trusts are struggling nancially 28 illustrate the limitations of NHS resources. Summit attendees suggested that the UK may not be utilising existing schemes to their full potential for the bene t of patients. The Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) 2014-2018 - a voluntary agreement between the Government and the pharmaceutical industry - governs how much the UK spends on branded medicines. If the NHS spends more on branded medicines than the agreed gure, then the pharmaceutical industry has agreed to reimburse the Department of Health (DH). 29 Attendees to the Summit highlighted that the deal was designed to keep the cost of branded medicines in check during a time of austerity. Yet industry representatives at the Summit have remarked that the rebates paid back by pharmaceutical companies to the DH have been getting smaller every year. Value NICE's cost effectiveness threshold stands at between \u00a320-30,000 per QALY, with medicines used for end of life having a higher threshold. In order to work out a medicine's cost-effectiveness, NICE rst makes a calculation to ascertain the value of the medicine. This is done using the extension in the average overall survival together with quality of life to calculate a QALY. The cost of treatment is then divided by the QALY gained by the new treatment minus the existing treatment and this is the number that will need to t into NICE's speci ed cost effectiveness range to be recommended for routine use. One of the ideas proposed at the Summit was to make the cost effectiveness threshold only one part of the process for assessing the value and impact of a new medicine. For example, very rare conditions for which no other treatments exist may warrant a higher threshold (cost per QALY) to refl ect the scarcity of treatment options. Severity of disease could be another aspect to determine the appropriate cost effectiveness threshold. At the Summit, pharmaceutical companies pointed out that clinical effectiveness can go up as well as down over time. Drugs are brought before licensing and appraisal bodies when there is enough evidence, but the data may not always be mature and thus may not accurately refl ect the long-term effectiveness of a treatment. If the true value of a medicine turns out to be higher than the pharmaceutical company's estimation at the time of marketing authorisation and NICE appraisal, the pharmaceutical industry argues that prices need to be fl exible enough to enable them to go up as well as down over time. For example, when the drug Herceptin (trastuzumab) was recommended by NICE in 2002 for use in metastatic breast cancer patients, NICE decided that whilst there was no signi cant bene t in overall survival, there were signi cant bene ts in progression free survival, duration of response and time to treatment failure. 30 However, a second study completed nearly a decade later found that this drug was very effective as an adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer, increasing women's survival and signi cantly reducing recurrence of the cancer. 31 Many medicines are initially trialed in patients with limited treatment options, often at the end of life, with their true value and bene ts not emerging until many years later, when they are tested earlier in the disease pathway. Price negotiation NICE does not have the power to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies on price, as it relies on set criteria to make a decision on whether a medicine is cost-effective and if it should be funded routinely. While this was designed to ensure that the NHS gets value for money, there was broad agreement from all attendees that greater fl exibility on price is a potential solution to making more clinically-effective drugs available. There was no agreement about how this could work in practice, however. Pricing of medicines is a particularly divisive issue, and it featured strongly in the discussions. The NHS is struggling to meet the needs of the population within a sustainable budget, as shown by recent reports of high numbers of Trusts operating in a de cit. 32At the same time, pharmaceutical companies spend many years developing new medicines and investing in obtaining the level of evidence required by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and NICE. Pharmaceutical companies have a nite window of opportunity to recoup their high research and development costs before their patent and exclusivity for the medicine runs out. Development costs are estimated to be over \u00a31bn per medicine licenced, over an average of 12.5 years of development. 33 The two sides in the pricing debate come from competing perspectives: one is to get a return on investment and the other to secure value for money. Due to the con dential nature of pricing within the global pharmaceutical industry, the true cost of developing medicines, as well as the commercial access agreements in other countries, are incredibly dif cult to uncover. As a result, it is dif cult to say what the cut-off price paid for medicines should be. At the very minimum, delegates suggested it is important that the drug appraisal process has several points at which the pharmaceutical company is able to change their prices. At present, pharmaceutical companies are only able to submit one price or commercial access agreement for an indication to NICE at the beginning of the assessment process. Once this process is underway, NICE will use the submitted price to make a decision. Since the company will make certain assumptions when it draws up its own cost effectiveness calculations, not all of which will be accepted by NICE, the result is often a negative decision and the appraisal process would need to be either appealed or begin again. However, pharmaceutical companies at the Summit noted that changes to prices or to patient access schemes mid-appraisal are often dif cult in practice. This is because most companies operate globally and therefore prices need to be agreed with the head of ce. Depending on the company, this can take a long time. Price negotiation is successfully used by other European countries to secure access to drugs for patients, and attendees suggested that the UK could certainly learn from international comparisons. The International Comparisons of Health Technology Assessment report, commissioned jointly by Breast Cancer Now and Prostate Cancer UK, 34 considers how mechanisms within the medicines appraisal system affects access to medicines for patients in countries of comparable wealth and health systems. This report highlights that in most other countries studied (Sweden, Germany, France, Canada and Australia) the drug appraisal system is made up of two parts. One body is responsible for carrying out a Health Technology Assessment - assessing the clinical value of a medicine and Section two: Scope for fl exible pricing Section two: Scope for fl exible pricing 22 23deciding how much better the new medicine is compared to what is currently available for that indication. Another body or the Government will then take the rating produced by the rst body to negotiate with the pharmaceutical company on the price of the medicine, agreeing to pay higher prices for medicines that present a big step forward and lower prices for medicines which make very small gains. It seems that the order of the appraisal process also plays a part in the likelihood of approving more medicines. By separating out the bodies doing the clinical assessment and the price negotiation, other countries are essentially rst appraising the clinical effectiveness of a new medicine and then deciding what price they will accept. This enables negotiation to happen, as the pharmaceutical company will know exactly what price will ensure a successful decision about the availability of the drug. Conversely, as part of the NICE system, companies need to submit prices and clinical evidence right at the beginning of the appraisal process. Upon closer inspection, the NICE Committee will often make slightly different assumptions to those submitted in the company model, often resulting in the original price no longer being deemed cost effective. Whilst no system is the perfect solution in this complex area, the UK is unique in making both clinical and cost judgments about medicines through the same body and at the same time. Multi-indication pricing One medicine may be effective in a number of different indications - whether for different stages of the same disease or for a range of different conditions. For example, the drug Avastin (bevacizumab), can be used to treat bowel, lung, kidney, ovarian, breast and cervical cancers. Some countries take the effectiveness of a drug across different indications into account by accepting different prices for different uses of the drug. This means that a higher price is paid for a more effective use of the drug and vice versa. This is not the practice in the UK and some Summit attendees asked whether incorporating it could help to move forward access to innovative drugs for patients. In the UK, companies are required to have one price for a medicine, resulting in the drug not being cost-effective in some indications and so rejected for those uses. 35 However, less effective medicines could work well for some patients, as every patient will respond differently to a treatment and the extended overall survival for a drug is only an average. Patients also appreciate having more treatment options available, especially when they are nearing end of life or if they have a rare condition, therefore there is often value in medicines which may seem only slightly more effective than the standard treatment. There are also some conditions for which few treatments are available. The split in prices for indications could therefore open up many more options for patients. Summit participants highlighted that the Department of Health (DH) prefers not to set different prices for different indications and the majority of deals it accepts are simple discounts. Pharmaceutical company representatives at the Summit also expressed reservations that a more complex pricing system may mean it is less likely that prices of a medicine will remain con dential internationally. However it is worth noting that prices of medicines have been kept con dential by DH and NICE in the past, and this system works well in other countries, like France 36, which suggests that that these barriers could be overcome.barriers could be overcome. More complex pricing arrangements require a robust and accurate reporting system, to ensure that drugs are reimbursed according to the way in which they were used, or according to the outcome they had. Such a reporting system already exists and the Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT) database was made mandatory in early 2014, but not all Trusts are fully compliant with these requirements. A minority of Trusts do not seem to have the necessary systems in place to be able to upload data to this database ef ciently, resulting in very low compliance levels. 37 However, recent conversations with NHS England suggest that SACT compliance is receiving a much stronger focus in the year ahead, with extra support for key Trusts planned, as well as potential levies for non-compliance in 2017. An improvement in the data collection on chemotherapies would remove one of the major barriers to more complex pricing arrangements between the DH and pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, an effective SACT would also pave the way towards extending data collection to cover all treatments and conditions in the future. Section three 24Patient involvement in the medicines appraisal process was the third area that attendees were asked to discuss in detail during the Summit. Participants were asked to consider whether patient's views are currently being taken into account, how involvement could be made more meaningful and how patients feed into the medicines appraisal process in the nations and in other countries. Participants reinforced the importance of meaningful involvement from those directly affected by the condition and suggested that this process should not be merely tokenistic. The medicines appraisal process needs to assess the value of a medicine with the patient in mind. Meaningful patient involvement Section three: Meaningful patient involvement S ection three: Meaningful patient involvement 26 27Quality of life measures Summit attendees pointed out that alongside traditional clinical trial data, quality of life data is a requirement for a NICE appraisal, yet it is not clear how this data impacts on the nal outcome of assessment. The AAR interim report suggested patients should be given a stronger voice throughout the innovation pathway 38, including at the very early development phase and during clinical trials. The report also promised to \"explore the scope for identifying and codifying patient-led outcome measures... to inform the evaluation of new products and the decisions made by regulators and other key bodies in the system\". 39 Summit attendees suggested that current quality of life data used by NICE is not suf cient for a good assessment of a new medicine and that NICE should develop a better quality of life measure by working directly with patient representative organisations. A recent report into metastatic breast cancer identi ed two studies that shed light on the value that patients attach to overall survival and to quality of life. A US study found that a majority valued quality of life higher, whilst European patients seemed to value overall survival more. 40 Anecdotally, patients tell Breast Cancer Now that they value their quality of life as much as extra life, but it is important that more robust research is carried out into the attitudes of UK metastatic patients to nd out whether weightings being applied by NICE actually refl ect the views of those people who are most affected by these decisions. The value of breast cancer drugs such as Kadcyla and Perjeta were assessed by the old CDF panel on a wider set of criteria than the NICE HTA system permits. This included a clear scoring system for the quality of life difference, on which both of the drugs scored higher than the comparator. 41,42,43 Participants also suggested that as well as quality of life data from clinical trials, this data could be supplemented in NICE assessments by real-world patient data, to give a richer picture of the value of a new medicine. Weighting patient experience Most medicines are developed initially for use in EOL, and if these are successful, they are tested earlier in the patient pathway. All but one out of the last nine breast cancer indications to be assessed by NICE have been for metastatic breast cancer. Participants pointed out that meaningful patient involvement is all the more important in the case of metastatic medicines, as those patients are living with a terminal illness and have precious little time left. Whilst we know that the level of patient involvement in the NICE HTA process is higher than what is found in other countries, this does not seem to translate into higher access to new medicines for patients. 44 One of the criticisms of the current NICE system raised at the Summit, is that whilst patient input is sought, there is no mechanism to ensure this can impact on NICE's nal decision on a medicine, as this is made on the basis of the clinical and cost effectiveness evidence. One possible solution would be to create a weighting for patient experience, which would feed into the nal decision. However, it is not clear how this kind of weighting could work in practice. During HTAs, NICE invites up to two patient representatives to give evidence at Committee Meetings and during consultations. 45 These spaces are open to both patients and patient representatives from organisations. Some participants at the Summit pointed to the fact that patient experience is naturally very personal and varied considerably between different individuals, so it is dif cult to ensure it is representative of all patients. Furthermore, it is not always possible to capture the views of all patients involved in trials when making a drug assessment, as trials often take place across many countries. This can be even more dif cult when the trial involves a rarer cancer type. This is an area sorely lacking in research. Patients living with terminal conditions have precious little time left, therefore it is imperative that engagement with this group is meaningful and a mechanism exists to allow their input to be taken into account when NICE makes their nal decision on a medicine. End of Life and rarer conditions EOL criteria, introduced in 2009, allows a higher cost per QALY to be accepted for these medicines, compared to other medicines. 46 In order to be considered for EOL, medicines need to be able to extend life by more than three months and be applicable to patient populations where the life expectancy is less than 24 months. 47 A cap of 7,000 patients, who might bene t from the treatment, has been removed from the EOL criteria in the proposals for the new CDF. 48 The rst two criteria cause inequities in access for patients at both ends of the spectrum. Patients with some types of metastatic breast cancer have a life expectancy that falls just outside of EOL criteria of 24 months, 49 whilst pancreatic cancer patients with metastatic disease have the lowest life expectancies for all common cancers: between two and six months. 50 The drug Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel), gives pancreatic cancer patients an additional two months of overall survival, which is excluded from the NICE EOL criteria, despite the fact that in this case it extends life by at least a third. 51 The threshold for life expectancy for EOL medicines is three years in Scotland, refl ecting the fact that there are some cancers, like metastatic breast cancer, have a longer life expectancy but are still terminal. There is also a clear case for some rare cancers with very short life expectancy to demonstrate value below three months. In early 2014, the Scottish Government published its response to the review of Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) processes which recognised that cost effectiveness thresholds are not always appropriate for the assessment of medicines with EOL indications and very rare conditions. 52 The result of this change meant that the Patient and Clinician Engagement (PACE) process was established in May 2014, giving clinicians and patients an opportunity to input into the nal decision in those special circumstances. 53 Summit attendees pointed out that the PACE has led to improvements in the appraisal process, however it is dif cult to conclude whether PACE has infl uenced SMC decisions on breast cancer treatments. A nitor and Halaven were recently approved in Scotland, following earlier rejections by the SMC. The resubmissions for these medicines did not include any signi cant changes to the PACE statements, therefore making it dif cult to establish whether statements by clinicians and patients contributed to the approval of the resubmissions for these two medicines.Next steps 28 29Whilst this report does not draw any nite conclusions on what a new medicines appraisal system should look like, it offers many possible areas where more fl exibility could be introduced. Throughout the report, we have refl ected on the overriding theme from the Summit: the need for a wide-ranging review of NICE and the opportunity for ongoing reviews and improvements to the system going forward.Whilst decision-makers and pharmaceutical companies come to the table with different interests and perspectives, these two stakeholder groups both need a better framework in which to work together for the bene t of patients and to ensure that the UK is one of the rst countries where promising new treatments can be made available. A number of areas came up in the main body of the report which warrant further research and analysis. The Health Technology Assessment process \u0081 More clarity is needed around some of the paradoxes arising from the current NICE method of calculating cost effectiveness of a medicine, including increased transparency on the effects of generic or branded comparators, and of longer or shorter progression free survival data on cost effectiveness calculations. \u0081 Alternative options should be explored with regards to neoadjuvant medicines, so that a timelier appraisal of these innovative medicines is possible in future. Clarity on how this group of medicines can qualify for entry onto the CDF would also be useful.Pricing of medicines \u0081 As well as clinical effectiveness, the concepts of value, budgetary impact and cost effectiveness are all potentially competing ways of assessing whether a treatment should be made routinely available to patients. Other considerations, such as availability of different treatment options, could also form part of the scoring system for new medicines. \u0081 Adding fl exibility to the appraisal system, especially in terms of price negotiation, will have an impact on NHS nances, which are already under pressure. More research needs to be done to model different values that could be relevant for a medicine and what effect this would have on access and NHS budget. \u0081 An assessment of incentive and risk for both the Government and the pharmaceutical industry is important when designing a new system, but ways to balance risk and competing priorities remained uncertain. Patient involvement \u0081 Practical ways of incorporating more meaningful patient involvement in a Health Technology Assessment was an area lacking practical ideas. Whilst all stakeholders highlighted this as an important aspect of the process to get right, no solutions were proposed on how patient experience could be incorporated into the decision-making criteria. This is an area that is sorely lacking in substantial research. \u0081 Some participants at the Summit felt that quality of life measures in trials do not capture all aspects of what is important to patients. Furthermore, companies mentioned that this data does not impact on the nal decision. More evaluation of the existing literature is needed to identify the gaps in research and analyse the different methods of measuring quality of life. \u0081 Further exploration is needed to determine how patient input could be weighted as part of the NICE assessment process to supplement the quality of life measures submitted by companies. Breast Cancer Now will continue to work collaboratively with all partners as we campaign for a reformed system which puts patients at the centre of the drug appraisal process. Access to innovative medicine is a key area of work for the charity and is an important concern for our patient stakeholders and supporters. We will also continue to work as part of the Cancer Drugs Fund charity coalition to monitor the outcome of the re-appraisal of the drugs on the old CDF as well as new medicines to ensure that the new system is working for patients.What will we do to take this work forward?Appendix 30 31The new CDF is potentially a valuable addition to the system, as it removes the very binary 'yes' or 'no' system, but without wider reform the overall effect is likely to be a step backwards for patient access A wide-ranging review is needed to bring NICE processes up to date and make them effective at making new medicines available to patients, with any new medicines appraisal system needing to have the con dence of all stakeholders A wider question was raised about whether one body should be responsible for assessing both the clinical and the cost effectiveness of new medicines NICE should learn from the Scottish Medicines Consortium's (SMC's) new Patient and Clinician Engagement (PACE) system, which has had an impact on the nal decisions in a number of appraisals since it was introduced As well as clinical effectiveness, the concepts of value, budgetary impact and cost effectiveness are all potentially competing ways of assessing whether a treatment should be made routinely available to patients There were calls from all groups for further simpli cation to the current NICE system but no practical ideas were proposed to make this possible Adding fl exibility to the appraisal system, especially in terms of price negotiation, will have an impact on NHS nances, which are already under pressure Some stakeholders suggested that the NHS could afford to pay more for new medicines and that investment in new medicines was important to continue the advancement of new cancer drugsMore fl exibility is needed in NICE's processes The concept of value and long- term value of medicines should be re-assessed by NICE The impact of generic comparators on the outcome of an appraisal should be evaluated Political will to reform the system is essential A more effective system of data collection, such as a fully working SACT, will enable more fl exible and innovative pricing arrangements to be proposed by pharmaceutical companies, as there will be accurate data on the volume of drugs used, the indication and the outcome of treatment Whilst the assessment of the value of medicines is a devolved matter, it is clear that patient access to innovative treatments varies greatly between the nationsThe PPRS scheme is not being used to its full potential, with payments from the pharmaceutical industry to the Government being much lower than expected in the most recent year Patient voice needs to remain as an important part of the medicines appraisal process and their engagement with the process should be more meaningful There are opportunities to involve patients earlier in the drug development process, including during clinical trial design and throughout the research stages Pharmaceutical industry and Government come to the table with very different priorities, but there is a need for a system that allows these two groups to meet somewhere in the middle for the bene t of patients Areas where some Summit attendees came to a consensus: Key confl icts, in need of further research: The method of meaningful patient involvement was an area of disagreement, especially with regards to how patient experience could be made more objective and more meaningful in practice An assessment of incentive and risk for both the Government and the pharmaceutical industry is important when designing a new system, but ways to balance risk and competing priorities remain uncertain 32 331 Breast Cancer Now and Prostate Cancer UK, International Comparisons of Health Technology Assessment, August 2016. 2 NHS England, Appraisal and Funding of Cancer Drugs from July 2016 (including the new Cancer Drugs Fund), July 2016. 3 NICE, Appraising life-extending, end of life treatments, July 2009. 4 Cancer Research UK, Breast cancer survival statistics (accessed 9 June 2016). 5 The Cancer Drugs Fund panel would rate a drug as 0 if the quality of life was the same as the comparator and on a scale between 2 and -2 if it was better/worse.
