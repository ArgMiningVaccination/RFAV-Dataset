IWAI is primarily responsible for development, maintenance and regulation of Inland Water Transport (IWT) in the country specifically on Nation al waterways. In this context, the Ganga -Bhagirathi -Hooghly river system from Allahabad to Haldia has been declared as National Waterway -I (NW -I). It is a natural waterway of about 1620 km in length and passes through the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jh arkhand and West Bengal. One of the limitations on viable Inland waterway transport on NW -1 is a weak navigation infrastructure. Therefore, IWAI has proposed the Capacity Augmentation of navigational infrastructure of NW -1 between Allahabad to Haldia with technical and financial assistance from The World Bank. In this regard, IWAI has commissioned Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) studies to map and understand potential environmental and social impacts associated with navigation improveme nt of NW -I and to prepare plan for effective mitigation and management of the Impact associated with the project. This report is prepared for Cumulative Impact Assessment (CIA) study which is the part of the ESIA study. ESIAs and Cumulative Impact Assess ments (CIAs) share the same basic logical framework and analytical process and tools for a basic logic framework for a CIA. However, they take different perspectives. The perspectives can be characterized as project -centered (ESIA) or VEC -centered (CIA). I n an ESIA the focus of analysis begins with the project. The area where the project will have environmental and social impacts is identified are the VECs that will be affected. The impacts on the VECs are identified and a mitigation hierarchy is applied to avoid them when possible and to minimize and mitigate them when avoidance is not possible. Where residual impacts remain, impacts and risks to workers, affected communities, and the environment are compensated or offset1. NW-1 is being fed by various tri butaries at different locations. Major tributaries to NW -1 between Haldia to Allahabad are Tons, Gomti, Ghagra, Son, Gandak, Punpun and Kosi. The following interventions have been proposed and planned under the Jal Marg Vikas Project. Maintenance dredging to provide LAD in waterway/channel and the terminal facility Improved Navigation Infrastructure & Navigation Aids o Construction of 5 Ro-Ro crossings & ferry passenger jetties. Locations of these jetties are yet to be identified. o Construction of 6 terminal s: Site identification and planning for 3 terminals sites at Sahibganj, Varanasi and Haldia is completed. 2 more potential sites for 1 Good Practice Handbook: Cumulative Impact Assessment and Management: Guidance for the Private Sector in Emerging Markets, Internati onal Finance Corporation, World Bank Group Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV development of terminals are identified at Ghazipur and Kalughat. These two sites are still under consideration for finaliz ation and planning of design at initial stage only. One more terminal site along NW -1 is being identified. o Construction of one Navigation Lock at Farakka, West Bengal. o Provision for tow barges, inland vessels, survey vessels including rescue boats and sur vey equipment. Development of low draught cargos. o Development of navigation aids along NW -I for facilitation of day & night time navigation. Development of efficient River Information System with all hardware & software. Provision for bank protection / slo pe protection and river training works for critical locations. The project also envisages the creation and improvement of integration opportunities with other surface transport modes such as roads and railways, so as to improve the overall efficiency of t he logistics chain by linking the waterways through various well equipped terminals and jetties. The main objectives of this study are: Assess the potential impacts and risks of a proposed and other developments over time on a chosen Valued Environment & Social Component (VECs) Verify that the proposed developments cumulative social and environmental impacts and risks will not exceed a threshold that could compromise the sustainability or viability of selected VECs ; Confirm that the proposed development s value and feasibility are not limited by cumulative social and environmental effects; Support the development of governance structures for making decisions and managing cumulative impacts at the appropriate geographic scale (e.g., airshed, river catchmen t, town, regional landscape); Ensure that the VECs of affected communities about the cumulative impacts of a proposed development are identified, documented, and addressed; and Manage potential reputation risks Approach & methodology based on Good Practi ce Handbook: Cumulative Impact Assessment and Management: Guidance for the Private Sector in Emerging Markets, International Finance Corporation, World Bank Group for CIA study is given below. Step 1: Identify VECs, and determine spatial and temporal Boundaries for CIA Step 2: Identify other activities and developments affecting VECs Step 3: Establish information on b aseline status of VECs Step 4: Assess cumulative impacts on VECs Step 5: Assess significance of predicted cu mulative impacts Step 6: Management of cumulative impacts - design and implementation Draft Cumulative Impact Assessment Report has been structured in seven chapters containing 1. Introduction and Background, 2. Project Description, 3. Delineation of CIA Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV boundaries and VECs, 4. consultations, Other Development Proposals and finalization of VECs, 5. Cumulative Baseline Study, 6 Cumulative Impact Assessment and 7 Mitigation measure and management Plan. Chapter 2 describes existing infrastructure & current traffic, compon ents and salient features. At first, project description has been summarized. This is followed by summary of existing project components, proposed components, applicable policies of India and World Bank Operational Policies. NW -1 project offers potential o pportunity for diversification of cargo movement from road & rail to waterways. In order to achieve this diversification, the existing infrastructure needs to be augmented with proposed project interventions. These proposed interventions consisting of both development & operation of navigation route require availability of water (depth) & its maintenance supported by new infrastructure. Further, these activities will trigger indirect & induced development in the influence area. Therefore, NW -1 development a long with these existing, direct, indirect & induced developments will have cumulative impact in the influence area. Chapter 3 describes spatial and temporal boundaries in order to assess the impacts of direct, indirect and induced activities due to propo sed project. Process of delineation of boundary largely depends upon the type of development & its potential to exhibit direct & indirect impacts on the surrounding environment. The chapter describes the CIA boundary, the rationale & basis of its delineati on, VECs within the delineated boundaries, and hot spots identified. Three levels of considerations have been taken into account for delineation of CIA boundary as described below. Basin level hydrological & ecological considerations (First Level): It is important to consider the various hydrological and ecological functions of the river valley and floodplains at a basin level for purposes of CIA. Therefore, active floodplain of River Ganga pertaining to NW -1 has been considered. Project Interventions ( Second Level): IWAIs interventions/activities of non IWAI entities have been considered in relation to study area including active floodplain in the context of NW-1 for identification of influence area. Overall (Third Level): In summary, based on active flood plain, basin level VECs report, IFC guidelines, stakeholders consultations, expert's consultation/ judgment, Indian regulations, ecosensitive zone, and abovesaid considerations, 10 km influence area (impact area) boundary has been considered to con duct the detailed CIA study of the project. Further considering hydrological & ecological functions of the river, basin level influence area downstream of Allahabad has been considered. This has been done in order to meet segment -wise approach and basin le vel approach (hydrological & ecological) as mentioned in ToR . In this study all the natural as well as manmade features have been taken into account and plotted spatially to delineate the boundary of the CIA. The natural and manmade features mapped are Fo rests; National parks; Wildlife Sanctuaries; Tiger Urban Agglomerations; Industrial Areas; Thermal Power Plants and Critically Polluted Areas, identified by CPC B. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV To conduct the detailed study of the project, 10 kms buffer boundary has been considered. The basis for delineating these buffer boundaries are based basin level VEC reports IFC guidelines and stakeholders consultations and the experts consultation/j udgment to determine the influence area for proposed CIA studies . In consideration of these 500 meters is taken as first level of influence, followed by 2 hour & 10 kms as second & third level of influence area. For EIA / EMP study area of 10 kms has been recommended. Based on these considerations, the influence area for CIA is basin level (Hydrology & Ecology) and 10 kms . Further, overlay mapping and GIS have been used for identifying the spatial distribution of VECs. Based on the above approach, mapping method as per IFC guidelines for Cumulative Impact Assessment and Management, VECs have been classified as given below. VEC VEC Components Cultural Aspects of Ganga Maintain the cultural values Maintain cultural events and cultural functions Conserve heritage sites, structures and values Ecosystem services Terrestrial biodiversity values Aquatic biodiversity Environmental flows Physical environmental services and natural processes Land use and soil quality Water Air Noise Socio -economic conditions Socio -economic infrastructure and facilities Opportunity and access to improved and conserved livelihood On the basis of the identified VECs, spatial analysis, literature review, hotspots have been identified. This lis t was further enhanced after addition of input from stakeholder consultations and baseline study of the VECs. Assessment of Status of Identified VECs including the site visits, study of the project alignment through topographic maps & Google maps, review of existing studies and literature was carried out to assess the status of identified VECs within the CIA boundary of NW-1. Stakeholders comprising government organisations, non government organizations, research and development organizations, academia, e xperts, individuals, community based organizations, were identified in the study area encompassing four states (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal) and outside these states for consultations with institutes of national repute like Wildlife Ins titute of India, Dehradun.. During the stakeholder Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV consultations, the views were taken on various aspects of project development in NW -1 and their likely impacts in the influence area. The identified VECs were also discussed with the stakeholders for confi rmation and finalization (Chapter 4: Public Consultations and Disclosures, Table 4.6). On the basis of the identified VECs, spatial analysis, literature review, hotspots have been identified. Identified hotspots and VECs in NW -1 have also been mapped. The VECs are the ultimate recipient of impacts because they tend to be at the ends of ecological pathways considering water related proposed activities both in terms of availability & quality in NW -1. These VECs may be directly or indirectly affected by a specific development or by the cumulative effects of several developments. Chapter 4 provides details of the public consultation and participation activities undertaken during the CIA stud y for the Project \"Jal Marg Vikas\". From CIA perspective, an effort wa s made by conducting consultations particularly in reference to confirmation of hotspots mentioned in Chapter 3 as well as to identify new hotspots, if any. The approach involved a mix of conventional as well as participatory/ rapid rural appraisal (PRA/RR A), focus group discussions (FGD) and one -to-one discussions with wide range of stakeholders encompassing government, non government organisations, local communities, research and development organisations, academia, media. Consultations have been carried out in line with World Bank Guidelines for conducting the public consultation. Finally, this chapter concludes with identification of hotspots based on preliminary assessment, baseline data and inputs from stakeholder consultations. The inputs of stakehold er consultations have been used in finalisation of hotspots. During the consultations for Jal Marg Vikas Project , it is found that there is mix view of people about the project. Some people take it as positive development as the proposed project wi ll benefit the economy of country. Whereas affected people, i.e. fishermen and land holders who will lose land are concerned about the restriction of fishing activity, reduction in fish yield, loss of land and livelihood and receipt of adequate compensatio n and alternate livelihood. Locals and experts are also concerned about the water pollution and impact on the aquatic fauna which may result due to the project. All the concerns were taken in consideration during assessment of impacts and the mitigation me asures are proposed for all the concerns to minimize/mitigate the impact. Mitigation measures proposed are well addressed in management plan along with their period of implementation. Chapter 5 provides details of baseline study which has been conducted t o assess the existing condition or status of the identified VECs in the study area. Baseline study has been carried out on the basis of secondary information collected from EIA/SIA study of NW -1, data from pollution control boards, IMD, Agricultural depart ments and other Governmental Organization. Baseline study has provided the details of condition of identified VECs along the NW -1 and of the district through which NW -1 traverse. This data has helped to identify the significance of the impact on the VECs c ondition and has provided the basis of carrying out the impact assessment study. Baseline study indicates NW1 has flat terrain with vast catchment being drained by main river along with tributaries. Geological influence area has alluvial soil and falls in Zone III & IV. Land use is largely agricultural land followed by water body, settlements with only 3.59 %vegetation. Turtle sanctuary, Vikramshila Cumulative Impact Assessment Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV are major VECs. Udhwa bird sanctuary is a protected area. This a rea has diverse terrestrial & aquatic biodiversity with spawning & breeding grounds adjoining NW1. Flow analysis indicates that NW 1 has flow constraints in certain stretches considering CAD requirements. Overall soil type / quality along the NW -1 are a is of moderately fertile and not expected to be detrimental to the growth of agricultural and forest crops. It can be concluded that soils fall within medium fertility levels in the entire stretch of NW -1and forms the basis of agriculture resources / cro pping pattern. Assessment of land resources indicates land use change particularly diversion of agriculture land for urbanization industries & infrastructure development. Though it is an ongoing phenomenon, any new infrastructure development intervention i s expected to accelerate it. No portion of NW -1 and intervention areas falls under any reserved forest or normal forests area. Ecologically the area has important VECs. Udhwa bird sanctuary and 5 other important bird areas are also located within 10 km ra dius of NW -1 stretch. However, project interventions like maintenance dredging with alleviate the flow constraints for smooth operation of the barges, water availability analysis also indicates the river water is good for propagation of wild life and fis heries. Observations on River Bed -Dredge Material Quality indicate that the concentration level of heavy metal was found low and within acceptable limit as per standard (Criteria for Off - Shore Dumping of Dredged Material, USA) except cadmium which is slig htly above the USA standard that may be due to industrial effluent discharge in this section. Pesticide concentration in all samples was found below the USA criteria. The pesticides presence is on expected line as these are predominantly used for various a griculture applications. The source of these pesticide parathion and endosulphan might be from applications of insecticides and pesticides for agriculture in the study area which has significant agriculture land use. Air quality in terms of PM 10, PM 2.5 NOx SO 2 has been found high in major urban centers. The population of major cities/ town located along the Ganga River in NW -1 section was recorded as 12875343 comprising 6782150 male and 6093193 females. Scheduled Caste population consisting of 544284 m ales and 483706 females respectively in major city/towns along the study area and accounts for 7.9% of the total population. The Scheduled Tribe population consist of 27576 males and 25244 females respectively and accounts for 0.41% of the total populat ion (12875343). About 75.4% of the population is literate and 23.6% is illiterate in cities/town located along the NW -1 is illiterate. Male population is more literate than female. In cities and town along NW -1 area the main and marginal workers2 are 14% and 29% respectively while the remaining 57% of total population constitutes non -workers. The main occupation is agriculture, labour class and trading activities. Agriculture is the main source of the livelihood generation for the people residing along the NW-1 area. Many towns in the area are primarily industrial. Ganga provides the necessary infrastructure for the factories to perform. Commercial fisheries in the Ganga River System are an important source of livelihood for the people residing along the Ga nga River. Pilgrimage and the 2A person who has worked for more than 183 days in a year is called the main worker. Marginal workers are those who have worked any time in the year preceding the census but have not worked for major part, whic h is not more than 183 days, of the year Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV associated tourism brings along a major source of revenue for religious towns and their people. There is substantial decline in major carps fish catch in Allahabad to Farakka stretch over past few years. At Buxar hilsa was the main fishery and with the commissioning of Farakka barrage the fishery declined sharply between 1972 -80. Fishery improved during 1981-86 due to improvement in landings of other species. Patna centre also showed drastic decline in major carp landings and a s compared to sixties it was almost half during 1986 -93. Decline at Bhagalpur was not as severe as at other centres. It is reported that almost every village along the both sides of the river are having some fishermen who earn their livelihood by fishing i n the Ganga river. Generally, one member of the family is engaged in fishing in lower stretch of NW -1(Allahabad to Haldia), sometimes two, the average comes to be 1.5. However, in upper stretch (Allahabad to Farakka) the average person engaged in fishing i s 1.2 that is mainly due to low fish catch in this stretch. Fishing Income: The monthly average income of the fisherman ranged from Rs.4000 to 7000 per month in Allahabad to Patna stretch. In lower zone (Farakka to Haldia) the average income of fisherman i s slightly high and ranging between 7000 to Rs. 10,000 per month because of higher catch and high value fish (mainly hilsa) in the catch. All the towns and cities along the NW -1 are well connected with national highways, state highways, district roads, r ailways. Cities like Varanasi, Patna, and Kolkata are also connected with airways. Eleven thermal power plants are located in close proximity of river Ganga between Haldia and Allahabad and 10 more are reportedly are proposed to be set up in close proximit y of the river. There are 30 class I cities and 8 class II towns along the mainstream of river Ganga at NW -1 segment. These cities are discharging 2173.8 MLD wastewater out of which only 959.6 MLD has the treatment capacity. The above mentioned baseline data provides basis for identification, classification & quantification of impacts. Chapter 6 provides Cumulative Impact Assessment of NW -1 from Haldia to Allahabad carried out for 10 km area in both sides along the entire stretch. For the purpose of CIA, VECs has been identified to assess their existing conditions so that probable impact & significance of the impacts on these VECs can be evaluated. Apart from direct interventions in NW -1, projects/activities of other agencies like EDFC, development of ind ustries and industrial area, zones, parks, thermal power plant, urbanization, road development, irrigations/dams schemes have been identified and their impacts assessed as small scale impact and large scale impacts as cumulative impacts (Table 6.4) For purpose of CIA study an influence zone is identified where cumulative impact due to NW-1 and other developments within this zone will be identified. Through preliminary desktop study, baseline study and stakeholder consultations the existing devel opments in influence area, baseline scenario of the influence area, pollution load in environmental area, planned and anticipated developments in influence area are identified. It is found that some zones are experiencing/will experience more of the above mentioned developments as compared to other zones. Such zones are demarcated on the basis of quantum and nature of developments the zone is experiencing or will experience in future. These zones are termed as hotspots as the impacts due to existing/planned development will be maximum/more in these zones as compared to other zones. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV Type and nature of the cumulative impact has been evaluated on all VECs in each finalized hotspot as given below .

It has been identified that nature o f impact varied from low to moderately high. For example Varanasi, Patna and Howrah, air quality of the area is already Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV impacted due to high PM 10 concentration. Varanasi turtle sanctuary and Dolphin sanctuary are the eco -sensitive zones in NW -1 which are b eing impacted due to existing development and will be impacted due to development of NW -1 and other upcoming and planned development in the area. Other areas like Barh, Danapur, Bhagalpur etc are sensitive due to presence of important bird area. Varanasi w ill be the common station of upcoming EDFC and NW -1 and exchange of material will take place between these two points. Depending on the sensitivity of the area and nature of existing & upcoming developments in the area, certain zones are declared as hotspo ts. Total 14 zones are identified as hotspots. Rating is provided to impact of each identified activity on VECs and it is found that impact on these hotspots due to existing, planned and upcoming development varies from low to moderate. As per the impact a ssessment it is also found that the identified impacts can be mitigated by implementing the mitigation measures and management plan. Chapter 7 provides strategic evaluation and recommendations to address cumulative impacts which are predicated on baseline status of identified VECs and impacts thereon. Identified VECs broadly are Physical environmental services and natural processes, Cultural Aspects of Ganga, Ecosystem services and Socio Economic Conditions. Components of VECs have been described in ter ms of its baseline status, possible impacts on VECs, strategic recommendations and responsibility for implementation. Strategic recommendations are: Water Availability: a) Ganga basin suffers from stress on water resources. N RGBs present hydrological status is very inadequately known, especially in terms of water availability and usage. The hydrological stat us needs to be determined afresh both temporally and spatially. (2) NRGBs water resource management plan must adopt distributed water storage in t he basins groundwater, lakes, tanks and ponds, and promote wetla nds and forests.(3) Increasing anthropogenic water usage needs to be checked by increased water use efficiency through realistic pricing of fresh water, incentives, techn ical assistan ce, allocation of water rights and entitlements to stak eholders, and promotion of water reuse and recycling. (4) A major policy shift in NRGBs water resource management should bring it under the ambit of natural resource management in the basin with emphasis on resource preservati on before exploitation, decentralized stak eholder contro l, and expert guidance and regulation.(5) All existing and future dams/ barrages must ensure longitudinal river connectivity and environmental flows (of water, sediments and other natural constit uents), and new projects should be approved or rejected on this basis. Efforts should be made to ensure environmental flows along the stretch of the river catering to environmental and social needs (ghats) of the basin (6) Increasing water withdrawals must be checked on a priority basis in critical regions.(7) The sediment resources of the Ganga river system need monito ring on a long-term basis and assessed comprehensibly in terms of both quantity and quality. The quantity and nutrient value of sediments trapped behind dams also need to be assessed, and nutrient-rich sediments need to be delivered to downstream river stre tches and floodplains.(8) Some major research needs include the determination of ecological limits, thresholds and interconnections of water resources in NRGB, and river flow Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV health assessm ents within the framework of ecohydrology. b) Further, climate change scenarios with recommendations on adaptation & mitigation strategies should be made part of recommendation a). Terrest rial biodiversity a) Compensatory afforestation and green belt development . Translocation of trees proposed to be felled should be attempted, if feasible. Aquatic Biodiversity a) Delineation of Exclusion (No Go) areas in Ganga Basin and NW -1 (With respect to Protected Areas) b) No-Go Areas - Ganga Main Stem other than NW -1 stretch c) Restricted Areas d) Propeller guards in vessels plying in NW -1 IWAIs vessels, cargo and tourist vessels plying in NW -1 through restricted and critical stretches as identified abo ve should take adequate environment and social safeguards as described below. a) Maintaining water depth of the navigation channel. This measure may reduce the disturbance to the migrating Hilsa, benthic habitat, facilitate escapement of fishes and aquatic mammals from direct impact of the barge/vessels, considering that the fully loaded barge draft is 2.7 m. This will also help Hilsa, which prefers more than 5 m depth for their migration. b) The spawning & breeding grounds are not identified in the entire NW -1 stretches. Spawning areas normally have enough sand depth and water depth in general. Normally the spawning activity occurs in the rainy season. All care shall be given during construction & dredging activities to avoid any damage to spawning, breeding a nd nesting habitat of threatened aquatic species like Dolphin, Smooth Coated Otter, Gangetic Shark, Mugger, Gharial, Turtle, Hilsa, etc during spawning season which is from May to August. c) Measures would also be required from aquatic perspective in term s of vessel movement speed, material handling (like coal dust spillages to river, oil spillages to river) and other operational aspects may have impact on aquatic life. Necessary design features to be included based on intervention specific environmental i mpact assessment and capital dredging impact assessment as well as mitigation measures proposed. Landuse & Soil Quality a) Land use change needs to be monitored in the short and the long term considering rapid urbanization in the influence area. Stress/ pres sure and carrying capacity of the hotspots needs to be assessed in future for better local area and zonal planning. b) Agriculture productivity and soil quality need to be monitored by agriculture department in the influence area. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV c) Any future development/ int ervention in NW needs to be well planned & designed, implemented and monitored from environmental perspective considering zero waste discharge approach, green buildings, access roads and railway infrastructure. These development/ interventions need t o be follow the statutory requirements like EIA/ EMP but also designed on the principles of 3Rs (reduce, recover & recycle) and adaptation for climate change. d) There is a need to monitor the economic activity particularly fishing activity and the sector in the entire NW 1 stretch to avoid its disruption Air a) Zonal planning and master planning of urban centers (hotspots) need to be upgraded in view of expected urbanization. These plans need to include developments related to NW 1 e.g. best locations for termi nals, access, connectivity (roads & railways) and related infrastructure. b) NW 1 operational strategy should aim for zero emissions. This should include alternate fuel e.g. CNG or renewable energy e.g. solar powered based barge/ vessel operations. c) GHG accoun ting should be carried out especially for terminal and operation related movement of NW 1.This should also include GHG avoided & added vis a vis rail and road transport. d) Air pollution monitoring infrastructure should be augmented in and around hotspots by state pollution control board. Noise OSHA guidelines shall be followed for exposure to specific noise levels for workers . Conducting hearing tests for workers also help in monitoring the impact of the higher noise level on workers health. Socio -economic Infrastructure Services & Facilities a) Adequate compensation should be given to the people losing the land. People have sentiments associated with River Ganga so relocation of people should also be given near to River only as desired by them b) Any utility or CPR like community temple, school, hospital, hand pump, well etc. if required to be shifted should be shifted immediately after the dismantling so as to minimize disturbance to people. Shifting should preferably be carried out on private land. c) Non-product ive lands, barren lands, raised lands; wastelands should be used for setting up labour camps, plant sites and debris disposal site. Agricultural land should be avoided. Land should be used for establishment of construction camps, debris disposal site and p lant site only after obtaining consent from land owner. d) Meetings should be conducted with nearby people six monthly to address the problems they are facing. A grievance redressal cell shall be set up at each intervention site. People should be communicate d about the facility & system of grievance redressal so as they can launch their complaints, if any easily. e) Fishing activity should not be restricted in the river. Alternate provision for fishermen should be given in case fishing activity is restricted. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV Opportunity and access to improved and conserved livelihood a) Barge/vessel movement will be restricted to the designated navigation route only. Maintenance of buoys, beacons, signs, gauges to mark the navigation channel b) Crew of the vessel carrying especially oil should be competent and experienced so as they can prevent the damage to fishing gears and boats. c) Marking of navigation channel through beacons and communicating information about the navigation channel monthly to fishermen and the expected timing or frequency of barges to fishing community so as they can be pre -informed and the damage to their boats and gears can be reduced. Barge movement schedule should be prepared in advance and should be shared with the fishermen d) Regularizing the barge speed to 7 -8 knots in bending areas so as bank erosion can be reduced due to barge movement resulting in lesser turbidity, enhanced planktonic growth and thus increased fish yield. e) River training works should be carried out at the bank locations which are prone to erosion to reduce the turbidity in shallow areas and its impact on fish yield. f) All measures to reduce the water quality pollution & to prevent damage to ecology due to barge movement as proposed above should be adequately addressed and implemented so as to minimise impact on fish yield due to the project. g) In case of damage of fishing nets, fishing crafts and other gears of fishers, arising due to barge operation, appropriate and quick compensations may be given to the aggrieved fishers. h) The barges may be fi tted with powerful searchlight and may sound horn so that fishermen can realize arrival of barge at least from 500 m -1 km away to prevent damage to fishing nets i) Regular consultations to be carried out with the fishing communities to get their feedback on the impact due to barge movement on fishing and problems they are facing j) Support shall be extended in terms of supporting setting up fish nurseries for improving fish productivity and training awareness of fishermen for better fishing techniques through i nstitute of repute like CIFRI. Maintain the Cultural Values a) Ensure availability of water including around the ghats and maintenance of water quality fit for bathing and performing rites and rituals. b) No waste in any form shall be discharged by vessel in the river so as to improve and maintain the quality of water c) Vessel movement shall be restricted or regularised during the identified major festival period as listed in section 2.0. d) Support for establishment of small enclosed areas dedicated for femal e bathing in every village along the NW -1 to allow female maintain their privacy. e) Support for improving cleanliness and at existing ghats at Varanasi and other locations f) Provision for improving/restoring selected Ghats, Kunds , etc. Maintain cultural eve nts and cultural functions a) Dredging operations should be restricted primarily to day time, i.e. 6:00 Am -10:00 Pm only to minimize noise impacts on the residents of nearby settlements. Dredgers Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV should be equipped with the noise reduction/masking equipment t o reduce the noise generation b) Dredgers should be placed in consultation with the fishermen so as to minimize the impact on their equipment/gears and their fishing activities c) Dredging should not be carried out in the areas close to Ghats in Varanasi and bu ffer of 2 km should be maintained for dredging during time of religious gatherings during Chat and Kumbh festivals. d) Material to be disposed on land may create nuisance odour due to exposure of anaerobic sediments with air. Thus if land disposal is involve d than disposal site should not be in upwind direction of any settlement area or sensitive locations like hospitals, schools etc. e) Log book should be maintained for recording the accidents at site/mortality of the any aquatic mammal and other fauna should be maintained. Analysis shall be carried out to assess the reason for the accident/mortality and measures should be taken to prevent repetition of the event. f) Dredging plan should be prepared by contractor and submitted to IWAI for approval prior to carryi ng out dredging operations. Dredging plan should be reviewed considering its location w.r.t environmental sensitive locations/archaeological locations/cultural festival/pollution influx in the area/dredged material quality & texture/available depth etc. Conserve heritage sites, structures and values a) Construction activities should avoid archeologically protected monuments/ structures/site as much as possible. b) As per Indian regulation no construction activity can take place within 300 m of archeologically protected monuments/ structures/site without written permission from archeological department. Such permissions may necessarily be obtained from archeological department. Other Benefits Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) It is recom mended that the Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) is followed in proposed development of terminals, etc. by IWAI and by other developers on account of induced development spurred by NW -1 project particularly in the influence area. Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) It is recommended that ECBC is followed in proposed development of terminals, etc. by IWAI and by other developers on account of induced development spurred by NW -1 project particularly in the influence area. Environmental Health & Safety Policy and EHS Management System An effective environmental health and safety policy is essentially required to be prepared for the project and it should be communicated to the workforce through displaying posters/bill boards/pos ters/glow boards and campaigning around the work site. Posters should be in Hindi, English & Regional language so as it can be understood by the workforce. Verbal Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV communication through campaigning also should be carried out. Some of the important days such as Environment Day (June 5), Red Cross Month (March), Emergency Preparedness Week (May 1 -7), National safety day (4th April), National Health Day (7th April), Fire safety day (14th April), 20th April (Earth day) can be planned for spreading the awaren ess for Environment Protection, Cleanliness and safety among work force through campaigning. For effective and systematic implementation of the project, it is desirable that IWAI (The EA) develops its Environmental and Social management systems which are auditable and effectively enforceable. Parallel can be drawn from the experience of National Highway Authority of India or Delhi Metro Rail Corporation and adopt EHS system on the similar lines. Each contractor should be contractually bound to follow such system and must have EHS management system in line with EAs management system. IWAI should also develop its standard technical guidelines for Environmental Assessment, Management and Reporting. Environmental Standards for operation and maintenance of Var ious Civil Interventions, Barge Movement and Dredging Operations The abovesaid activities have potential to pose threat on the environmental quality. Regulatory Authorities of India and other countries have specified certain limits of pollutants which, if maintained, environmental pollution can be maintained. The Environmental standards applicable for the operation and maintenance stage of the project and that should be adhered to are listed below. Standards for discharged of effluent in inland surface w ater bodies and Marine Coastal Areas (Source: G.S.R 422 (E) dated 19.05.1993 and G.S.R 801 (E) dated 31.12.1993 issued under the provisions of E (P) Act 1986) Classification of Surface water Bodies on basis of Quality (Source: Guidelines for Water Quality Management -CPCB, 2008) Water Quality Standards for Coastal Waters, SW -IV & V -Harbour and Navigation & controlled waste disposal (EIA Guidance Manual for Ports & Harbours, MoEF&CC, GoI) Standards for permissible level of water quality indicators (Source: As sessment of the Environmental Impact of Port Development, United Nations, New York, 1992) Permissible limit for off -shore dumping of dredged material (Source: Assessment of the Environmental Impact of Port Development, United Nations, New York, 1992) Criteria for harmful bottom sediments (Source: Assessment of the Environmental Impact of Port Development, United Nations, New York, 1992) Approximate Quantity of Suspended Sediments Generated by Dredging or Dumping Operations (Source: Assessment of the Envir onmental Impact of Port Development, United Nations, New York, 1992) MARPOL 73/78 for prevention of pollution from ships SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) as per latest amendments (Chapter I -XII) CPWD Norms for construction of off -shore works, river bank prot ection structure, carrying out dredging works, river training works Zero discharge from vessels and proposed terminals Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV Zero discharge is recommended at all terminals site to minimize water pollution from the site and from plying vessels to address poten tial pollution. Zero Emissions and reduction of GHG emissions NW-1 operational strategy should aim for zero emissions. This should include alternate fuel e.g. CNG or renewable energy e.g. solar powered based barge/ vessel operations. GHG accounting shou ld be carried out especially for terminal and operation related movement of NW 1.This should also include GHG avoided & added vis a vis rail and road transport. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND 1.0 Introduction From the beginning of history, huma n sensitivity has revealed an urge for mobility leading to a measure of Society's progress. The history of this mobility or transport is the history of civilization. For any country to develop with right momentum, modern and efficient, transport as a basic infrastructure is a must. It has been seen throughout the history of any nation that a proper, extensive and efficient road transport has played a major role. Where roads are considered as veins and arteries of a nation, passenger and goods transported ar e likened to blood in circulation, water transport is the cheapest and the oldest form of transport for heavy goods and bulk cargoes. Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) is a statutory body under Ministry of Shipping, Govt. of India. IWAI is prima rily responsible for development, maintenance and regulation of Inland Water Transport (IWT) in the country specifically on National waterways. In this context, the Ganga -Bhagirathi -Hooghly river system from Allahabad to Haldia has been declared as Nationa l Waterway -I (NW -I). It is a natural waterway of about 1620 km in length and passes through the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. One of the limitations on viable Inland waterway transport on NW -1 is a weak navigation infrastructur e. Therefore, IWAI has initiated the project of \"Capacity Augmentation of National Waterway -1\" as \"Jal Marg Vikas Project\". However, considering the available LAD and cargo demand scenario, IWAI is focusing on the stretch between Haldia to Varanasi at present. In this regard, IWAI has commissioned Social & Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA) studies to map and understand potential environmental and social impacts associated with navigation improvement of NW -I and to pr epare plan for effective mitigation and management of the Impact associated with the project. This report is prepared for Cumulative Impact Assessment (CIA) study which is the part of the SEIA study. 1.1 Need for the CIA Study and Objectives Need for th e CIA Study : Over time, all the proposed projects in NW1 are expected to have direct and indirect environmental and social impacts in their immediate area of influence and beyond. Environmental and social impact assessment & mitigation plans will be prepar ed and will be implemented to mitigate, offset, reduce negative impacts and strengthen positive impacts on the environment and communities in the individual project areas. However, a need for a study to understand and analyse the incremental, induced and c umulative impacts of all the proposed in NW1 was identified. Other regional development, including potential development in infrastructure sectors such as roads, transport and storage, urban development, industry and tourism can also be triggered, as a res ult of development of inland navigation. These induced developments, if any, would also influence environment of Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV the Ganga basin. Therefore the assessment of cumulative (direct, indirect, induced) impacts of all these developments, parallel or induced, wil l provide a holistic view of their magnitude and extent in the Ganga basin over a longer period of time. To this end, this CIA will assess the cumulative impacts expected due to planned projects over several time horizon, and will recommend measures to be implemented in planning and development of all future activities related to NW, including capacity augmentation of NW -1. The CIA study shall address the following components: 1: Quantity of flow 2. River Water Quality 3. Avoid or minimize impacts on valued environment and social component 4. Area level social impacts 5. Strategies for development and operation of the waterway It will also serve as a guideline document for planned interventions in NW1 in future. As per the need of the project, the main o bjectives of this study are as follows: Assess the potential impacts and risks of a proposed and other developments over time on a chosen VECs ; Verify that the proposed developments cumulative social and environmental impacts and risks will not exceed a threshold that could compromise the sustainability or viability of selected VECs ; Confirm that the proposed developments value and feasibility are not limited by cumulative social and environmental effects; Support the development of governance structures for making decisions and managing cumulative impacts at the appropriate geographic scale (e.g., airshed, river catchment, town, regional landscape); Ensure that the VECs of affected communities about the cumulative impacts of a proposed development are id entified, documented, and addressed; and Manage potential reputation risks These objectives will be achieved by carrying out activities viz. inception stage as wll as feasibility and design stage. This includes cumulative environmental & social impacts a ssessment on the identified VECs and formulation of development and operational strategy of the waterway. At the feasibility and design stage, this includes updation of the inception stage strategy considering feasibility and design of the interventions proposed in NW -1. 1.2 Study Area, Project Description The NW -1 falls in Ganga basin & the stretch starts from Haldia (Sagar) to Allahabad (1620 km) on Ganga - Bhagirathi - Hooghly river system. The Hooghly river portion of the waterway from Haldia to Nabadwip is under tidal influence. From Nabadwip to Jangipur the NW1 stretch is formed by Bhagirathi river. Bhagirathi river flow is regulated through barges at Farakka and Jangipur. From Farakka upstream the navigable route depends upon the main Ganga riv er flow. The Feeder Canal and the navigation lock at Farakka become the link between the Bhagirathi and main Ganga up stream of Farakka Barrage. NW -1 is passing through four states namely UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Location map, Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV alignment map of NW-1 in Figure 1.1. Proposed Project -Jal Marg Vikas aims at improvement of navigation in entire stretch of 1620 km. of NW -1 (Haldia to Allahabad).NW -1 Ganga - Bhagirathi - Hooghly river system. NW-1 is being fed by various tributaries at different locations. Major tributaries to NW -1 between Haldia to Allahabad are Tons, Gomti, Ghagra, Son, Gandak, Punpun and Kosi. The following interventions have been proposed and planned under the Jal Marg Vikas Project. Maintenance dredging to provide LAD in waterway/channel and the terminal facility Improved Navigation Infrastructure & Navigation Aids o Construction of 5 ro-ro crossings & ferry passenger jetties. Locations of these jetties are yet to be identified. o Construction of 6 terminals: Site iden tification and planning for 3 terminals sites at Sahibganj, Varanasi and Haldia is completed. 2 more potential sites for development of terminals are identified at Ghazipur and Kalughat. These two sites are still under consideration for finalization and pl anning of design at initial stage only. One more terminal site along NW -1 is being identified. o Construction of one Navigation Lock at Farakka, West Bengal. o Provision for tow barges, inland vessels, survey vessels including rescue boats and survey equipmen t. Development of low draught cargos. o Development of navigation aids along NW -1 for facilitation of day & night time navigation. Development of efficient River Information System with all hardware & software. Provision for bank protection / slope protectio n and river training works for critical locations. The project also envisages the creation and improvement of integration opportunities with other surface transport modes such as roads and railways, so as to improve the overall efficiency of the logistics chain by linking the waterways through various well equipped terminals and jetties. Cargo being transported in NW -1 includes cement, fly ash, iron ore, iron ore fines, coal, steel shed, tyres, iron fines, iron ingots, Galvanized steel plain sheets, ston e chips, furnace oil, high Speed diesel, lube oil, boulders, pulses, aluminium block, sand, chips, ship block, log, pulses, Manganese ore, Petroleum, Coke, Cooking coal, Rock Phosphate, Timber, Peas, Slag oil, and Non -cooking coal.

Cargo transported include cement, fly ash, iron ore, iron ore fines, coal, steel shed, tyres, iron fines, iron ingots, Galvanized steel plain sheets, stone chips, furnace oil, high Speed diesel, lube oil, boulders, pulses, aluminium block, sand, chips, ship block, log, pul ses, Manganese ore, Petroleum, Coke, Cooking coal, Rock Phosphate, Timber, Peas, Slag oil, and Non -cooking coal. Cargo traffic and the commodities transported in NW-1 vary in different stretches. Cargo volume by rail & road mode along NW -1 stretch for year 2014 is given at Table 2.2. Table 2.2: Current Traffic Along NW -1 Stretch (2014) Commodities By Road (in tonne) By Rail (in tonne) Total Cargo (in HPC&HOWE ENGINEERING PROJECTS (INDIA) PVT. LTD. (DESIGN CONSULTANT) Table 2.2 indicates that the current potential along NW -1 vis a vis other modes is very high which can be sha red by NW -1. Further, an Indo -Bangladesh Protocol on Inland Water Transit & Trade also exists between India and Bangladesh apart from intra country water transport. Under Indo -Bangladesh Protocol, inland vessels of one country can transit through the spec ified routes of the other country. The existing protocol For Inter -country trade, four ports of call have been designated in each country, namely; India -Haldia (West Bengal), and Ashuganj. 2.3 Traffic Projections & Components of Planned Project Traffic project ion study for 30 years has been undertaken by survey and marketing consultant HPC for growth of traffic under three scenarios, i.e. base scenario (in absence of Jal Marg Vikas Project), Medium Augmentation scenario (Jal Marg Vikas project with 3 m LAD upto Barh, 2.5 m until Ghazipur and 2 m upto Varanasi) and Full augmentation scenario (LAD of 3 m upto Patna and 2.5 m upto Varanasi). For the current study, HPC has considered scenario for medium augmentation. Since traffic will be generated for different str etches, the traffic projection is made Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG -Patna & Patna -Varanasi. The traffic projection for these stretches as per medium augmentation scenario is given below in Table 2.3, 2.4 & 2.5 .

Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV 2.3.1 Component s of the Planned Project Entire stretch measures 1620 kms and traverses through 4 states namely Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. Developments planned under the Jal Marg Vikas project to support traffic forecasts as on date includes: Maintenance dredging to maintain the LAD in waterway/channel and the terminal facility Improved Navigation Infrastructure & Navigation Aids o Construction of 5 Nos. of Ro -Ro crossings & ferry passenger jetties. Location for these jetties is not yet identified. o Construction of 6 Nos. of terminals. Site identification and planning for 3 terminals sites at Sahibganj, Varanasi and Haldia is completed. 2 more potential sites for development of terminals are identified at Ghazipur and Kalughat. These two sites are st ill under consideration for finalization and planning is at initial stage only. One more terminal site is to be identified along NW -1. o Construction of Navigation Locks o Provision for tow barges, inland vessels, survey vessels including rescue boats and survey equipment. Development of low draught cargos o Development of navigation aids along NW -1 for facilitation of day & night time navigation Development of efficient River Information System with all hardware & software Provision for bank protection / slope protection and river training works for critical locations 2.3.2 Depth & Width of Navigation Channel & Size of Vessel / Ships It is planned to maintain depth of 3 m from Haldia to Barh, 2.5 m from Barh to Ghazipur and 2.2 m from Ghazipur to Varanasi at p resent * 5. Further, it is planned to maintain the channel width of 65 to 45 m and side slopes of 1:10 from section Haldia to Varanasi6. As per IWAI planning, Vessels of maximum length 110 m, beam 11.4 m, draught 2.5 m -2.8 m and air draught of 9 m will ply in the waterway. However, the vessel size will vary in different stretched as per the available LAD and type and quantity of cargo to be transported. Vessels of size 1500 -2000 DWT is expected to ply in the waterway. Study for cargo estimation is under p rocess and size of the vessels will be finalized accordingly. 2.3.3 Challenges for Project Development Some of the major challenges include nature of the river, its morphology & related phenomena along NW -1. River Ganga (NW -1) is alluvial river with ty pical characteristic of braiding, meandering and large water level fluctuation between summer and monsoon months. Wide 5 Source of Data: (Detailed Feasibility Study for Jal Marg Vikas Project and Detailed Engineering for its Ancillary Works and Processes between Haldia to Allahabad by HAWE Engineering Projects (India) Pvt. Ltd). * quantities are tentative and subject to change with revision in planning 6 Source of Data: (Detailed Feasibility Study for Jal Marg Vikas Project and Detailed Engineering for its Ancillary Works and Processes between Haldia to Allahabad by HAWE Engineering Projects (India) Pvt. Ltd). Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV variations in water level are observed ranging from 2.5 m at Farakka to 16.5 m at Allahabad. Current velocity varies between 0.2m/s durin g lean season to 4.0 m/s during flood season in the stretch between Allahabad to Farakka. Current velocity is 1.2 m/s in Feeder Canal & 1.7 m/s (max.) in Bhagirathi river stretch. Ganga carries annual silt load of 1600 million tons. Fine silt leads to ra pid shoal formation. It becomes difficult to maintain even 2 m depth during low water season throughout the stretch. The stretch between Haldia and Tribeni (196 km) is tidal and the Least Available Depth (LAD) of more than 3.0 m is maintained naturally the rein. IWAI has to erect bandals and carry out dredging to maintain the LAD in upper stretches of Tribeni. Due to unavailability of adequate depth/width and navigational infrastructure facilities, navigation of the large cargos throughout the year is not po ssible. Major challenges for navigation in NW -1 are listed below. 1. Highly braiding and meandering river 2. Large water level fluctuation 3. Unavailability of LAD for navigation throughout NW -1 and unreliable water depths 4. Existence of sharp bends 5. High silt load & shoal/bar/island formation leading to splitting of main channel 6. Growing of bars reducing the available depth 7. Lateral migration of the river and change in navigation line 8. Existence of power line pylons at various locations 9. Existence of pontoon bridges. Abo ut 7 pontoon bridges are present between Buxar and Allahabad which are in use. Pontoon bridges are significant threat to navigation 10. Existence of siphon in the Farakka feeder canal for irrigation purpose which generates eddy currents, reduces water level by 0.1-0.2 m in immediate vicinity of the structure and reduction in buoyancy of vessel due to presence of air bubbles in water column above this siphon leading to increase in vessel draught 11. Existence of critical bridges (bridges with Horizontal Clearance (H C) & Vertical Clearance (VC) less than 70 m & 9 m respectively). Details of the critical bridges are given below in Table 2.6 below. 12. Inadequate navigation infrastructure and aids like inadequate fairway width, channel marking, navigation lights, signals, R IS etc., lack of modern vessel based navigation aids, absence of effective waterway reporting & tracking system etc. Table 2.6: Details of Critical Bridges on NW -1 S.

LTD. (DESIGN CONSULTANT) Apart from above bridge, some bridges at Varanasi, Balua, Hoogly and Munger are also navigational hazard. Available width of the navigation channel is reduced significantly due to presence of bridge piers of these bridges or due to their orientation w.r.t river flow or due to their location. 13. Some of the bends in the NW -1 are significant w.r.t. navigation. There are 10 significant bends in U.P. stretch, 1 bend at U /s of Farakka and 63 significant bends in West Bengal. Due to presence of these bends, additional channel width will be required. Details of the significant bends are given in Table 2.7 .

Barge maintenance and repair facility Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV Figure 2.3: Planned NW -1 Under Jal Marg Vikas project 2.4.8 Barge Maintenance & Repa ir Facility Barge maintenance and repair facility is essential component of Jal Marg Vikas Project. At present no location has been finalized for the purpose but this development is under planning. Barge maintenance and repair facility will comprise of th e following Slipway: It is a ramp, which helps in moving the barge/ship to and fro from water to land. Slipway will be provided in deeper water conditions so as design vessels can be taken in docking conditions. Winch House: It should be provided in strai ght-line to mail slipway. It is generally a single room like structure and should have adequate space for winch and electrical equipment Repair bay for large & small vessels: Repair bay for vessels should be inclined so as the vessels can slide towards the river on its own after repair under control of winch. Transfer bays: To transfer small vessels between slipway and repair bay Winches and trolleys. Winches should be provided at winch house and at transfer bay. Trolleys should be provided to receive the v essels on main slipway. Workshops and buildings with all basic utilities like water, electricity, storm water management system and waste management system. 2.4.9 Waste Mangement at Maintenance & Repair Facility Since at this facility, vessel repair, ma intenance and waste management will be carried out, proper waste management facility is required for these facilities. These facilities should have Effluent treatment plant so as the oil water, vessel washing water, floor washing water can be treated here. Further STP are required at these sites to treat sewage generated at facility and sewage generated from vessels. These facilities should have a proper waste management plan which should detail about segregation of different type of waste which may generat e at this site or can be received from the vessels, e.g. municipal waste, recyclable waste, bio -mediocal waste, packaging waste, sweeping waste, plastic waste etc. For each type of waste a specific waste management plan should be prepared. Waste treatment facility to the extent possible should be proposed within the maintenance and repair facility. For the waste which cannot be treated inhouse, should be sent for treatment and disposal to authorized vendors only. List of those authorized vendors for each ty pe of waste should be available in the plan. 2.4.10 Material Handling, Transport and Storage Material handling including transportation, storage, loading and unloading will be involved at terminals and jetty sites. Material handling at some planned site is manual, i.e. is through pay loaders, barge loaders, dumpers, trucks and at some sites is mechanical through conveyor belts and Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV pneumatically depending on type and quantum of cargo to be transported. Considering the environmental effect, it is strongly suggested to adopt mechanical mode of material handling only for loading & unloading of barges and pneumatic transportation of the fly ash to minimize dust generation. 2.4.11 Construction material sourcing Construction materials required majorly for the project development are bricks, steel, cement, timbers, sand etc. It is preferred that construction material will be sourced from nearby areas preferably.

It has a specific section on freshwater resources. The environment policy c learly states integrated approach for management of River basins with emphasis on water u se efficiency and conserv ation, afforestation of banks, wetlands management, assessment and mitigation of impacts and reduction of pollution loads. The policy also emphas izes the need for research in glaciology and imp acts of climate change. a) Promote research in glaciology to evaluate the impacts of climate change on glaciers and River flows. b) Promote integrated approaches to manage ment of River basins by the concerned River authorities, considering upstream and downstream inflows and withdrawals by season, interface between land and w ater, pollution loads and natu ral regenerat ion cap acities, to ensure maintenance of adequate flows, in particular for maintenance of in-stream ecological values, and adherence to water quality standards t hroughout their course in all seasons. c) Consider and mitigate the impacts on River and estuarine flora and fauna, and the resulting change in the resource base for livelihoods, of multipurpose River valley projects, power plants, and industries. d) Consider mandating the installation of water saving closets and taps in the building bye -laws of urban centres, and other available regulatory mec hanisms. e) Integrate conservation and wise use of wetla nds into River basin ma nagement in volving all relevant sta keholders, in particular local comm unities, to e nsure maintenance of hydrological regimes and conservation of biodiversity. f) Incorporate a special component in afforestation programmes for afforestation on the banks and catchments of Rivers and reservoirs to prevent soil erosion and improve green cover. National Forest Policy Resolution of 1952 and National Forest Policy of 1988: The National Forest Policy (1988) establishes a principal aim to ensure environmental stability and ecologic al balance including atmosphere equilibrium which a re vital for substances of all life for ms, human, animal & plant, and directs that the domestic requirements of poor and marginalized forest users should be the first charge on forest produce. The policy calls for the enhancement of income and employment throu gh improved and increased pro duction of non -wood forest products (NWFPs), and proposes that a massive peoples movement with the involvement of women should be launched to achieve the objectives. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV The Government of India (GOI) has detailed legislative fra mework imposing various restrictions for developments of inland & water areas. The key legislations include Wildlife Protection Act , Forest Conservation Act , Environmental Protection Act and Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act . Various national parks & sanctuaries are notified under above acts which impose ban of any activities without following a defined clearance process going up to Supreme Court level. Such areas have been considered as no go areas wherever applicable in the basin and project intervention areas. Other areas identified like reserve forest, Hilsa sanctuaries are also notified but with much lesser degree of restrictions. 2.5.1 International Conventions, Protocols and Agreements International Maritime Organization C onventions: India is member state of the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

The 1974 version includes the tacit acceptan ce procedure - which provides that an amendment shall enter into force on a specified date unless, before that date, objections to the amendment are received from an agreed number of Parties. The Convention came into force on May 25, 1980 2. Measurement of ships Load Lines Convention,1966 It has long been recognized that limitations on the draught to which a ship may be loaded make a significant contribution to her safety. These limits are given in the form of freeboards, which constitute, besides externa l weather tight and watertight integrity, the main objective of the Convention. 3. Preventing collisions at sea Convention on International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREG), 1972 The 1972 Convention was designed to update and replace the Collision Regulations of 1960 which were adopted at the same time as the 1960 SOLAS Convention. One of the most important innovations in the 1972 COLREGs was the recognition given to traffic separation schemes - Rule 10 gives guidance in determining safe speed, the risk of collision and the conduct of vessels operating in or near traffic separation schemes. 4.

Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matte r (LC), 1972 (and the 1996 London Protocol) London Convention, one of the first international conventions for the protection of the marine environme nt from human activities, came into force on 30 August 1975. Since 1977, it has been administered by IMO. It contributes to the international control and prevention of marine pollution by prohibiting the dumping of certain hazardous materials. In addition, a special permit is required prior to dumping of a number of other identified materials and a general permit for other wastes or matter. 13. Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co operation International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Resp onse and Co - operation (OPRC), 1990 As per convention, Ships are required to carry a shipboard oil pollution emergency plan. Operators of offshore units under the jurisdiction of Parties are also required to have oil pollution emergency plans or similar ar rangements which must be coordinated with national systems for responding promptly and effectively to oil pollution incidents. Ships are required to report incidents of pollution to coastal authorities and the convention details the actions that are then t o be taken. The Convention calls for the Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV Sr. No. Issues International Maritime Conventions, Protocols and Agreements Remarks establishment of stockpiles of oil spill combating equipment, the holding of oil spill combating exercises and the development of detailed plans for dealing with pollution incidents.

Preparedness, Response and Co -operation to pollution Incidents by Hazardous and Noxious Substances Protocol on Preparedness, Response and Co - operation to pollution Incidents by Hazardous and Noxious Substances, 2000 (OPRC -HNS Protocol) Convention aims to establish national systems for preparedness and response and to provide a global framework for interna tional co -operation in combating major incidents or threats of marine pollution. Parties to the OPRC -HNS Protocol are required to establish measures for dealing with pollution incidents, either nationally or in co -operation with other countries. Ships are required to carry a shipboard pollution emergency plan to deal specifically with incidents involving hazardous and noxious substances. The OPRC -HNS Protocol ensures that ships carrying hazardous and noxious substances are covered by preparedness and re sponse regimes similar to those already in existence for oil incidents. 15. Control of Harmful Anti- fouling Systems International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships (AFS), 2001 Under the terms of the AFS Convention, Parties to the Convention are required to prohibit and/or restrict the use of harmful anti -fouling systems on ships flying their flag, as well as ships not entitled to fly their flag but which operate under their authority and all ships that enter a port, shipyar d or offshore terminal of a Party. Anti-fouling paints are used to coat the bottoms of ships to prevent sealife such as algae and molluscs attaching themselves to the hull - thereby slowing down the ship and increasing fuel consumption. n the early days of sailing ships, lime and later arsenic were used to coat ships' hulls, until the modern chemicals industry developed effective anti -fouling paints using metallic compounds. These compounds slowly \"leach\" into the sea water, killing barnacles and other mari ne life that have attached to the ship. But studies have shown that these compounds persist in the water, killing sea - life, harming the environment and possibly entering the food chain. One of the most effective anti -fouling paints, developed in the 1960s, contains the organotin tributyltin (TBT), which has been proven to cause deformations in oysters and sex changes in whelks.

Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships The Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships, 2009 Convention aimed at ensuring that ships, when being recycled after reaching the end of their operational lives, do not pose any unnecessary risk to human health and safety or to the environment. It intends to address all the iss ues around ship recycling, including the fact that ships sold for scrapping may contain environmentally hazardous substances such as asbestos, heavy metals, hydrocarbons, ozone depleting substances and others. It will address concerns about working and env ironmental conditions in many of the world's ship recycling facilities. Regulations in the new Convention cover: the design, construction, operation and preparation of ships so as to facilitate safe and environmentally sound recycling, without compromisin g the safety and operational efficiency of ships; the operation of ship recycling facilities in a safe and environmentally sound manner; and the establishment of an appropriate enforcement mechanism for ship recycling, incorporating certification and repor ting requirements. Ships to be sent for recycling will be required to carry an inventory of hazardous materials, which will be specific to each ship. 17. Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments, 2004 Convention a ims to prevent the spread of harmful aquatic organisms from one region to another, by establishing standards and procedures for the management and control of ships' ballast water and sediment. Under the Convention, all ships in international traffic are required to manage their ballast water and sediments to a certain standard, according to a ship -specific ballast water management plan. All ships will also have to carry a ballast water record book and an international ballast water management certificate. The ballast water management standards will be phased in over a period of time. As an intermediate solution, ships should exchange ballast water mid -ocean. However, eventually most ships will need to install an on -board ballast water treatment system 18. Salvage Convention, 1989 International Convention on Salvage (SALVAGE), 1989 As per convention, \"special compensation\" to be paid to salvors who have failed to earn a reward in the normal way (i.e. by salving the ship and cargo). The compensation consists of the salvor's expenses, plus up to 30% of these expenses if, thanks to the efforts of the salvor, environmental damage has been minimized or prevented. The salvor's expenses are defined as \"out -of-pocket expenses reasonably Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV Sr. No. Issues International Maritime Conventions, Protocols and Agreements Remarks incurred by the salvor in the salvage operation and a fair rate for equipment and personnel actually and reasonably used\". 19. The United Provinces Fisheries Act, 1948 The Fisheries Act provides for the prohibition and licensing of fishing in selected waters. Definition of fish is a b road one under the Act and includes a wide gamut of aquatic biodiversity including \"turtles, dolphins, aquatic plants, fisheries, whale and fish in all states in its life history\". For the purposes of regulating fishing, the rules made under this Act pro vides for selected waters where there is prohibition for fishing. However, this excludes private waters 7and religious waters 8. The authority constituted under this Act has been vested with power of arrest without warrant, compound certain offences as well as prohibit the sale of fish in such area as may be specified. 7 Private waters are exclusive property of any person or religious body or institution where such persons or institution has exclusive right o f fishery. 8 Religious water means water belonging to a religious body or institutions and which have never been fished before on account of any restrictions on religious grounds. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV 2.6 Conclusion Project descriptions give a developmental perspective of NW -1 in a cumulative manner. NW-1 project offers potential opportunity not only for diversification of cargo movement from road & rail to waterways but also add additional capacity to the existing movement. In order to achieve this diversification, the existing infrastructure needs to be augmented with proposed project interventions. These proposed interventions consisting of both development & operation of navigation route require availability of water (depth) & its maintenance supported by new infrastructure. Traffic projection study for 30 years has been carried out & has been considered. Major challenges for navigation in NW -1 include: h ighly braiding and meandering river; large water level fluctuation; unavailability of LAD for navigation throughout NW -1 and unreliable water depths; existence of sharp bends; high silt load & shoal/bar/island formation leading to splitting of main channel; growing of bars reducing the available depth; lateral migration of the river and change in navigation line and existing bridges & other structures. Further, these activities will trigger indirect & induced development in the influence area not expected to exceed 10 kms within different segments of NW -1. Therefore, Phase -1, NW-1 development along with these existing, direct, indirect & induced developments will have cumulative impact in the influence area not exceeding 10 kms, considering all the segments of the stretch . Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV CHAPTER 3: DELINEATION OF CIA BOUNDARY AND VEC s 3.0 Introduction The proposed Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) is expected to enhance the economic development of the country by augmentation of the freight transportation substantially. The JMVP will provide the accessibility to the areas through which it traverses as well as to the nearby areas leading to to development and growth of these areas. This necessitates that study area size should be based on the extent of the area where accessibility improvements could occur and may require some judgments about the extent of the influence of the project. Therefore, Cumulative Impact Assessment (CIA) requires fixation of spatial and temporal boundaries in order to assess the impacts of direct, indirect and induced activities due to proposed project. Process of delineation of boundary largely depends upon the type of development & its potential to exhibit direct & indirect impacts on the surrounding environment. The following sections describe the CIA boundary, the rationale & basis of its delineation, VECs within the delineated boundaries, and hot spots identified. 3.1 Delineation of the CIA Boundary Important factors which need to be considered for proposed asse ssment of indirect and cumulative impacts and impact interactions is the setting of the geographical or spatial boundary and the temporal or time frame boundary. Indirect and direct impacts as well as impact interactions may well extend beyond the geog raphical site boundaries of the project. Therefore preferred methodology for detailed analysis is a combination of collaborative judgment and GIS based allocation mode as described in chapter 1. Hence, mapping the geographical and time boundaries provides areas of potential overlap and therefore where indirect and cumulative impacts as well as impact interactions may occur. Three levels of considerations have been taken into account for delineation of CIA boundary described below. Basin level hydrological & ecological considerations (First Level) It is important to consider the various hydrological and ecological functions of the river valley and floodplains at a basin level for purposes of CIA. Therefore, active floodplain of River Ganga pertaining to N W-1 has been considered. Consideration of floodplains of River Ganga has been made to delineate the influence area (impact area). The geomorphic features with in active flood plain as Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV mapped in Ganga River Basin Management Plan is considered9. Geomorphic features in the channel belt and active floodplain along the Ganga River pertaining to NW -1 stretch is given in Annexure 3.1 . It is observed that t he mapping of valley margin and geomorphic features in the active floodplain along the Ganga river shows sig nificant diversity in terms of valley width and geomorphic features in different reaches of the river. These differences have important implications for water resource ma nagement and ecological restoration. The stretc hes with wide valleys and active flood plains could provide sites for creating artificial recharge sites keeping in view the present -day landuse. The channel -belt and floodplain features should provide important insights to the possible habi tats for aquatic and land biota. Valley margin of the Ganga River in NW-1 stretch is summarized in Table 3.1. Table 3.1: Maximum and minimum width and major characteristics of valley margin in NW -1 Stretch Maximum and minimum width, km Major characteristics Allahabad to Varanasi 14.2/1.8 Valley width quite variable and extends to both banks of the river, sinuous course of the river frequently swings from the right edge to the left edge of the valley. Varanasi to Munger 36.1/7 Valley widens significantly downstream of Varanasi and is evenly distributed on l eft and right bank of the river; valley width reduces significantly downstream of Patna and also becomes asymmetric, mostly spread along the left bank. Munger to Farakka 39.2/7.3 Large parts of the valley are spread towards the left bank and the river is flowing at the southern edge of the valley up to 95 km downstream of Munger after which it swings to the northern and southern edges alternately. Table 3.1 shows that in NW -1 minimum valley margin width of 1.8 kms is observed in Allahabad -Varanasi stret ch while maximum valley margin width of 39.2 kms is seen in Munger to Farakka stretch . National Mission for Clean Ganga describes hydrology of Ganga as \"Annual flooding is the characteristic of all rivers in the Ganga basin. The Ganga rises during the mons oon but the high banks restrict the flood water from spreading. The flood plain is usually 0.5 to 2 km wide. This active flood plain is flooded every year\"10. Project Interventions (Second Level) 9 Active Floodplain Mapping: Defining the \"River Space\", Report Code: 005_GBP_IIT_FGM_DAT_01_Ver 1_Dec 2010, NGRBA 10 National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV In the above background and context, the extent and scope of proposed JMVP project of IWAI and interventions/activities of non IWAI entities have been considered in relation to study area including active floodplain in the context of NW-1 for identification of influence area. Environment, socio -economic and project design and operations perpectives have been considered for delineation of influence area as described in Table 3.2. Table 3.2: Criteria for delineation of influence area for CIA Serial number Parameters Impact area/ particular Criteria I: Environment , Ecological and Socio -cultural perspective 1 Air pollutants limited to 400 metres 2 Noise dispersion from piling and dredging 500 metres 3 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) IBAs are connected to main river Ganga, located within 2 kms of river Ganga 4 Ecosensitive Zone 10 kms around notified protected areas 5 Major human settlements and school, hospitals etc 200 metres 6 Archeological monuments 300 metres is considered as regulated (buffer) area 7 Ghats Located within 500 metres from main stem of River Ganga. Criteria II: Project design and operation perspective: 1 Project interventions for capacity augmentation of NW -1 (e.g. proposed terminals and associated infrastructure like road and rail connectivity), navigation locks, RORO terminals, etc. These are located with in 10 kms from the main stem of River Ganga. 2 Dredging in Ganga. Barge (9 metres) movement would be in the main stem of river Ganga and dredging would be confined within the banks of Ganga River. 3 Plying of vessels. Restricted within the NW -1 (Ganga River) 4 Existing and proposed infrastructure development projects including multimodal terminal development with road and railway network (including DFCCILs proposed alignment), urban conglomerations, irrigation schem es, dams, barrages, thermal power plants, etc. These are located/proposed to be located within 10 kms of River Ganga. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV Considering the abovesaid factors, 500 metres is taken as first level of influence area, followed by 2 kms and 10 kms as second and third levels of influence area respectively. Overall (Third Level) In summary, based on active flood plain, basin level VECs report, IFC guidelines, stakeholders consultations, expert's consultation/ judgment, Indian regulations, ecosensitive zone, and abovesaid considerations, 10 km influence area (impact area) boundary has been considered to conduct the detailed CIA study of the project . Further considering hydrological & ecological functions of the river, basin level influence area downstream of Allahabad has been considered. This has been done in order to meet segment -wise approach and basin level approach (hydrological & ecolocial ) as mentioned in ToR . 3.2 Valued Environment & Social Components (VECs) VECs are environmental attributes that ar e considered to be important in assessing risks. While VECs may be directly or indirectly affected by a specific development, they often are also affected by the cumulative effects of several developments. VECs are the ultimate recipient of impacts because they tend to be at the ends of ecological pathways. VECs in general refer to sensitive or valued receptors of impact whose desired future condition determines the assessment end points to be used in the CIA process. 3.2.1 Approaches for Identification of VECs To identify the VECs for CIA study, it is possible to largely obtain cumulative opinions of various stakeholders which are directly & indirectly impacted due to proposed development, and extensive review of the existing environmental and social i mpact assessment studies of the proposed project. Approach followed to identify VECs for purpose of CIA study is shown in Figure 3.1 .

Based on the above approach, mapping method as per IFC guidelines for Cumulative Impact Assessment and Management, VECs have been classified as given below. VEC VEC Components Cultural Aspects of Ganga Maintain the cultural values Maintain cultural events and cultural functions Conserve heritage sites, structures and values Ecosystem services Terrestrial biodiversit y values Aquatic biodiversity Environmental flows Physical environmental services and natural processes Land use and soil quality Water Air Noise Socio -economic conditions Socio -economic infrastructure and facilities Opportuni ty and access to improved and conserved livelihood Other benefits 3.2.3 Identification of Indicators to Assess Conditions of VECs Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG JV To analyze the conditions and impact on identified VECs various indicators have been identified & analyzed as given in Table 3.3 . These indicators will help to identify the extent of impact on the identified VECs and assist in defining \"Cause & Effect\" relationship. 3.3 Assessment of Status of Identified VECs An extensive study including the site visits, study of the proje ct alignment through topographic maps & Google maps, review of existing studies and literature was carried out to assess the status of identified VECs within the CIA boundary of NW - 1. The boundary delineation exercise identifies the potential impacts con sidered to be significant and which require further assessment. In this study all the natural as well as manmade features have been taken into account and plotted spatially to delineate the boundary of the CIA. The natural and manmade features mapped are as follows: Forests; National parks; Wild Life Agglomerations; Industrial Areas; Power Plants Critically Polluted Areas, based on Compr ehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI) Details are given in Table 3. 4 for NW -1.

Based on these consideratons, the influence area for CIA is basin le vel (Hydrology & Ecology) and 10 kms. Further, VECs, their current status and hotspots in the NW -1 influence area have been identified. These VECs are the ultimate recipient of impacts because they tend to be at the ends of ecological pathways considering water related proposed activities both in terms of availability & quality in NW -1. These VECs may be directly or indirectly affected by a specific development or by the cumulative effects of several developments. Therefore, it is essential to carry out th e stakeholders consultations (a kind of collaborative judgement) considering other proposed developmental work within the CIA influence area. This will give insight into type and extent of impacts and after finalization of hotspots, further baseline assess ments of the VECs can be done. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V CHAPTER 4: PUBLIC CONSULTATIONS AND DISCLOSURE 4.1 Introduction Public consultation is one of the key components of the environmental assessment. The CIA/ESIA team conducted public consultations in project site area and study area. From CIA perspective, an effort was made by conducting consultations particularly in reference to confirmation of hotspots mentioned in Chapter 3 as well as to identify new hotspots, if any. The approach involved a mix of conventional as w ell as participatory consultations, focus group discussions (FGD) and one -to-one discussions with wide range of stakeholders encompassing government, non -government organisations, local communities, research and development organisations, academia, media. Prior consultations have been carried out in line with World Bank Guidelines for conducting the public consultation followed by summarising the findings. . Finally, this chapter concludes with identification of hotspots based on preliminary assessment, bas eline data and inputs from stakeholder consultations. This chapter provides details of the public consultation and participation activities undertaken during the CIA study for the Project \"Jal Marg Vikas\" extending from Allahabad to Haldia. During public consultation, emphasis was placed on a fully -inclusive, open and transparent public participation process in the transfer of information regarding the project and likely impacts from the project on each environment and social components. A number of stakeh olders are involved in this project ranging from the local communities, local bodies, State & Central Level Government agencies and Non - Government Organizations. 4.2 Methods of Public Consultation Consultations were conducted during and prior to the CIA study to obtain the views of people about the project and to ensure their involvement. Issues pertaining to both environment and social environment were discussed in depth during the consultations. Consultations were carried, prior and during the CIA stud y of the different components of the Jal Marg Vikas project. Since the project comprises of various components like terminals, jetties etc., informal consultations were undertaken in reference to these proposed components at the respective locations. One t o one and focused consultations were conducted on informal interview basis. No questionnaires/ brochures were supplied to the participants. The discussions were primarily focused on receiving inputs from the participants regarding their acceptability and e nvironmental concerns arising out of the project. Consultations were initiated with the short description of the upcoming project components under Jal Marg Vikas Project. The objectives, proposed developments and the possible impacts of the project compone nts and the connectivity links of the study area with the project were Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V also explained. The survey team recorded their perceptions, demands and recommendations, about the project. Consultations were carried out for different planned components at different time periods. The details of the same are given in Table 4.1. Table 4.1: Detail of Developmental Activity and Period of Public Consultation Sr. No. Details of Developmental Activity Period 1. Haldia Terminal Sep, 2015 2. Farakka Lock June, 2015 3. Sahibga nj Terminal July-Nov, 2015 4. Varanasi Terminal Oct-Nov, 2015 5. Patna Sept 2015 6. Movement of Barges in Buxar & Patna Area Feb, 2016 7. Proposed development in NW -1, Bihar & Jharkhand April, 2016 Visits were made to the villages and offices of the local bodies, Government officials, Universities and NGOs to meet the stakeholders and obtain their views. Local people included the farmers, fishermen, boatmen, land owners, cultivators and students. Interaction with females was also done during the informal f ocused group discussions. During the consultations, it was found that people are generally aware about the IWAI planning for development of planned components, i.e. terminals and lock. Again a brief was provided to people prior consultation. People were th en asked about their views, issues and expectation from the project. Focus on both environmental and social issues was given during the consultations. Consultations were carried out for the interventions sites where acquisition of land involved has associa ted R & R issues and indirect impact. Two large scale consultations have been carried out for the project, one for Farakka Lock at Bewa Panchayat, Farakka and second for Sahibganj Terminal at Ashram, SamdaNala village, Sahibganj. Invitation letter were gi ven through e -mail and through in person meeting to Local bodies, Government officials & NGOs for attending the public consultation, minimum a day before the formal public consultation meeting. 4.3 Objectives of Public Consultation The public consultati ons were conducted with the following objectives: To spread awareness and generate understanding about the project among stakeholders, and to collect their opinion, suggestions for planning and designing of the project To assess positive as well as adve rse socio economic and environmental impacts in the area through participatory methods such as walk through and focus group discussions. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V To identify the need and concern of the public To assess cultural patterns and behaviour of local communities towards the project To understand the environmental and social issues associated with the project through discussions To understand suggestions and opinions of the community, Government officials and NGOs on mitigation measures to counter and check the adverse and negative impact that threaten the socio economic environment in the area. To understand the satisfaction level of people with proposed mitigation and management measures proposed for the project 4.4 Outcome of Stakeholder Consultation People and are sup portive of the project in general. Extract of the public consultation meetings held are attached is given in Annexure 4.1. Main concerns raised during the consultation and redressal of the concerns is given at Table 4.2. Table 4.2: Main Outcome of Consul tation and Redressal of Concerns Sr. No. Outcomes/Concerns Redressal 1. Development of the project will ensure continuous water flow in the river. This will be positive to the fisher groups as regular flow in the river will have a increased fish availabilit y throughout the year and will provide a sustainable income to the fisher group families. 2. The project may lead to fish kill especially during construction and will affect the fishing business. The fisher groups expect the Government to provide them with some compensation for the loss of income during this period. The fishing activity may be affected adversely during the movement of the vessels along the corridor. This should be mitigated with measures as provided mentioned. Mitigation measures and managem ent plan includes the measures for reduction of impacts of intervention construction &operation, maintenance dredging and barge movement on fish yield. Some of the measures are: Regulated/slow speed shipping Management of pollution by ships/vessels Intimat ion of dredging/piling plan to fisher groups prior carrying out any activity Enhancement of fishing in the area by boosting and funding fish nurseries and provision of better fishing aids and funding training of fishermen by CIFRI or organizing training pr ogram for fishermen through CIFRI Provision of sirens and strong search lights in vessels/barges so as fishermen would know the approach of ship/barge from minimum distance of 500 m 3. Nearby roads to the terminal facilities should be strengthened and widen ed, as there may be substantial increase in traffic movement in the roads These roads being constructed as approaches to the terminals will require to large weight trucks and should be constructe d accordingly. Presently the two locations that are being connected are Sahibganj terminal and Varanasi terminal. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V Sr. No. Outcomes/Concerns Redressal connecting the terminal site after development of terminal. 4. Dredging activity will have an impact to the ghat sections which is called in-pits The river, scouring off the silt from under the concrete, has been catapulting their bodies into the deepening abyss on the fringes of the ghats. This could be an impact of the dredging activity. Thus such locations where people are utilizing the ghats for bathing/swimming or other activities should be warned or information of the dredging activity publicized so that causalities to life is minimized or avoided. There could also be sign boards displayed at prominent places for information. 5. Turtle will get impacted due to regular movement of ships and vessels in river. Only 1 -2 vessels per hour are expected to move in the sanctuary area. Speed of vessels will be maintained to 5 kmph/2.7 knots in turtle sanctuary area. Such speed barges generate noise in order of 11 -140 dB. Threshold noise level of turtles for cha nge in behavioural response is 150 dB which is above the noise expected to be generated by moving barges and the impact on turtles behaviour responses is insignificant. Other measures are also being proposed in the EMP to minimize impact of barge movement on turtle. 6. Oil spillage from ships during accident may impact the aquatic flora, fauna and water quality Safety measures to be taken by vessels are given in the EMP. This will minimize the chances of accidents and will facilitate the quick clean -up oper ations in case of spillage 7. Concerns regarding the water quality issues which may be there due to construction of terminal facility and operation of cargos, spillage in case of accidents, discharge of waste and sewage, oil leakage and other related acti vities Environment management plan has incorporated the measures for barges and terminal facilities to be taken up to minimize the water pollution 8. Adequate compensation should be provided for the land which will be acquired SIA has been carried out for S ahibganj terminal site and RAP/LA/compensation plan has been prepared as per the R & R Act, 2013 and R & R policy for the project 9. Demand for livelihood by the people who will lose their land Engagement of NGO can be taken up to find them alternative live lihood. 10. At Sahibganj, locals expressed that they were keen on being relocated near the River Ganga It was informed that a relocation site has been identified by the District Officials near the current habitation in the Diyara land Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V Sr. No. Outcomes/Concerns Redressal 11. Large number of tree cutting is involved at Sahibganj site which may impact the climate. Compensatory plantation is proposed to be undertaken. At all the terminal/jetty sites green belt will be developed to the extent possible. This will help in minimizing the impact and will lead to reduced impact of CO 2. 12. Impact of barge movement on dolphins Regulated speed of barge movement in dolphin sanctuary area. Provision of propeller guards to prevent entangling of dolphins. Other measures are also proposed in management plan to redu ce the impact on dolphins 13. Plying vessels at present get stuck in lean season and this enhances the impact LAD is proposed to be maintained in stretch between Haldia to Varanasi during entire lean period 14. Dredging may have significant impact on breeding and spawning season Dredging is proposed to be regulated during this season 15. Erosion occurs along the bank of feeder canal and that is creating problem. Ship movement has further enhanced erosion River training works of 39 km are proposed to be undertaken on banks of feeder canal 16. As part of social development, the local immersion Ghat at Durgachak(near project site) should be expanded by the project sponsors to overcome the current congestion especially during the local festival. Proposal is made to unde rtake expansion of ghat and budgetary provisions are also kept. 17. The access road of Haldia terminal needs to be carpeted as present road is not in good condition. Shall be carried out as part of project development 18. Provision for appropriate parking faci lities inside the proposed terminal for better management of container carrying vehicles. Provision of parking area is made at each terminal site 19. Sanjana Chemicals near Haldia terminal site suggested that no water logging should take place at terminal si te and nearby areas after development of terminal Adequate storm water drainage is provided at the site to drain the storm water and fire - fighting facility is also proposed at the site. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V Sr. No. Outcomes/Concerns Redressal and firefighting measures should be provided at the site 4.5 Formal Public Consultation Meetings Formal public consultation was conducted for Terminal at Sahibganj & Lock at Farakka. Formal consultation at Sahibganj was conducted at Ashram, Samda Nala village, Sahibganj. Formal consultation at Haldia was conducted at Be wa Panchayat, Farakka. Request for support and participation in public consultation meeting was sent to stakeholder, Gram Panchayat, other locals such as fishermen and Local Administrations. Some of the stakeholders were invited by giving invitations perso nally. Villagers were invited through Gram Sarpanch and also by giving door to door invitations. 4.5.1 Formal Consultation in Sahibganj and Farakka Meeting was started with brief introduction about the project by Mr. Ravi Kant, Director IWAI, Patna. At the community meetings information on the socio -economic studies, environment impact studies and other engineering related to the proposed terminal of IWAI were discussed. He requested stakeholders to cooperate and provide information to these teams for fa cilitating their studies. The stakeholders and community members were then given an opportunity to raise their concerns regarding the proposed project. About 700 people participated in the PCM. Meeting was attended by Government officials, PAFs, World Ban k Officials, IWAI Official, CIA team and General public.

Also it is expected that traffic will increase in the area, thus to prevent dust generation and traffic congestion, it is required to construct minimum 4 lane road to connect site to NH -80. 3. ROB should also be c onstructed above the railway line to allow smooth flow of traffic 4. Green belt should be maintained along the approach road to suppress the dust generation 5. Assessment of increase in traffic should also be carried out on existing roads so as expansion can be planned when required 9.

Kesang Dhendup Bhutia BDO & Block Executive Officer Farakka Block Development Office, Farakka, Murshidabad BDO, Farakka, welcomed the project development and assured his and local administration cooperation for the project implementation. Also mentioned that without addressing environmental and social concern/impact in a structured manner no project can be completed on tim e successfully. Any kind of toxic pollution by the vessel like oil spillage and chemicals in the river water, transport emissions, needs to be considered. The project implementing agency should be careful about river erosion during the vessels movement. Ri ver bank erosion has a permanent effect upon the socio -economic conditions and demographic dislocation. As Farakka BDO, he appealed to the authority that they should provide jobs to the local unemployed youth based on their skill and should give business o pportunities to the local people. The access road needs to widened and upgraded to ensure smooth traffic movement because it has an important link with NH -34. A traffic management plan needs to be in place. He suggested that the project should employ local people in the proposed location on a priority basis provided they have the required skills. The health safety and protection of labour and other community members should be considered on project site as well as nearest locality of the villages during the operation phase.

This ensures involvement of public, NGO, experts in the projects pre -planning stage itself and addressal of their problems and exp ectation from the projects. The inputs of stakeholder consultations have been used in finalisation of hotspots. During the consultations for Jal Marg Vikas Project, it is found that there is mix view of people about the project. Some people take it as p ositive development as the proposed project will benefit the economy of country. Whereas affected people, i.e. fishermen and land holders who will lose land are concerned about the restriction of fishing activity, reduction in fish yield, loss of land and livelihood and receipt of adequate compensation and alternate livelihood. Locals and experts are also concerned about the water pollution and impact on the aquatic fauna which may result due to the project. All the concerns were taken in consideration duri ng assessment of impacts and the mitigation measures are proposed for all the concerns to minimize/mitigate the impact. Mitigation measures proposed are well addressed in management plan along with their period of implementation. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V CHAPTER 5: BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL PROFILE OF THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT INFLUENCE AREA 5.0 Introduction Baseline study is an essential component of cumulative impact assessment of any project. Baseline study aims at collecting & collating the data on the VECs and their indicat ors. This data provides the basis on which an impact assessment can be carried out. It not only helps to determine the existing scenario of the study area in terms of environment and social conditions but also helps in identification of external environmen t and social drivers which may have an impact on the identified VECs due to future developments within the area. This will further assist in identifying & redefining hotspots. Baseline study also provides an insight into both existing & future condition of the area within the boundary for which CIA study has to be carried out. 5.1 Influence Area Baseline study area coverage includes NW -1 & area within 10 km on either side of NW -1 to study the sites declared by ASI as heritage & cultural sites; to study eco-sensitive areas like national park, wild life sanctuaries, bird migratory routes etc. and major development area / critical zone having potential to be impacted by NW -1 which may further impact the surrounding environment. Map showing the study area fo r baseline study of the NW -1 is given below in Figure 5.1. List of the districts through which NW -1 passes is given in Table 5.1 below.

Physiographically, it constitutes a part of the Indo -Gangetic plain, which is largely flat, featureless and is formed of recent alluvial deposits of the river Ganga and its tributaries. Riv er erosions, change in course of rivers and human activities of recent times have played an important role in shaping the relief of the river terrain. Based on the contour of the NW -1, the Digital Elevation Model has been prepared for 10 km area around the NW-1. The Nearest Neighbour method has been used to interpolate the elevation data to develop the elevation model. The elevation within this stretch ranges between 321 m to 1 m. Highest elevation was observed at Sahibganj area (Jharkhand), because of pres ence of hillocks in this area. This map depicts clearly that the elevation of waterways declines from western to eastern part towards Haldia. Digital Elevation Model of study area is shown in Figure 5.2 . Figure 5.2: DEM of NW -1 Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V 5.3.3.2 Drainage Pattern (Ganga River) The Ganga River (about 2525 km long) is fed by runoff from a vast catchment area bounded by the snow peaks of the Himalaya on one side in the north and the peninsular highlands and the Vindhya Range on the other side in the south. The basin encompasses an area of more than a million square kilometres (1,186,000 Sq. km) spread over four countries: India, Nepal, Bangladesh and China. With 861,404 Sq.km within India itself, the Ganga basin is the largest river basin in India and covers approxim ately 25 per cent of Indias total geographical area. The catchment area, length, total utilizable water of Ganga river basins within India and the states that they cover is given in Table 5.3 . State wise distribution of drainage area of Ganga River is giv en in Table 5.4 . Table 5.3: Ganga river Basin Catchment Area Sl. No. Length (km.) Catchment Area (Sq. km.)

Drainage pattern of the NW -1 is controlled by these rivers. By the time Ganga reach the head of its delta at Farakka (after Rajmahal) i n the state of Jharkhand, its water flow and volumes increases substantially due the contribution from these tributaries. Its water quality and sediment load also fluctuate depending on the composition of the contributing stream. Beyond Farakka, the Ganga River bifurcates into the Padma and the original channel of the Ganga, known as the Bhagirathi. Therefore, the Bhagirathi is treated as the main Ganga for all purposes in West Bengal. The Padma carries the majority of Gangas flow, eventually turns south -eastwards into Bangladesh, while the Bhagirathi (Ganga) winds southwards down the deltaic plain of West Bengal and ultimately empties into the Bay of Bengal under the name of Hugli. Nearly halfway between Farakka and Sagar Island, the hydraulic character of the Bhagirathi (Ganga) changes upon its entry into the tidal zone of the Gangetic delta. The speed and direction of water in the estuarine streams and creeks are in continual flux due to the ebb and flow of the tides. Drainage Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V Map of NW -1 is shown in Figure 5.3 . Line diagram of the NW -1and its major tributaries is shown in Figure 5.4 . Figure 5.3: Drainage Map of 2 Km radius of NW -1 Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V Source: NMGC report Diagram of Ganga and its tributaries 5.3.3.4 Geology Ganga river basin is part of the tectonically active foreland basin of the Himalayan mountain range formed by collision of the Indian tectonic plate with the Eurasian plate more than fifty million years ago. Thus, most of the area of NW -1 consists of alluvial plains formed during t he Tertiary and Quaternary periods by flood deposits of Himalayan Rivers. The Ganga River network not only conveys water, but also transfers enormous amounts of eroded Himalayan sediments to the sea. The alluvial deposits on the plain area constitute large and highly productive multi -aquifer systems in the area, which are a major storehouse of ground water. The soils of the area are also largely alluvial. Geological map of NW -1 is provided in Figure 5.5 . Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V Figure 5.5: Geological Map of India 5.3.3.5 Seism icity As per seismic classification of India most of the NW -1stretch falls under zone -III which mean moderate seismic risk. Some stretch in Bihar state falls under zone IV which means high seismic risk. The seismic zoning map of India is shown at Figure 5 .6.

About 11 per cent of total land of NW -1 states are fallow land and 52% percent as net sown area. The cropping intensity is highest in west Bengal with 184.1 per cent followed by Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

Systematic interpretation was carried out using a set of digitized images with color coding for delineating the land use classes. By integrating the areas demarcated under different land use/land cover as different colors are assigned to different land use/land cover types of satellite imagery11 . The land use classes in 10 km area of the NW -1 are agricultural land, settlement, water body, forest, barren land and vegetation. It is majorly dominated by agricultural land about 78.9 % of the land is under cultivation. NW -1 also passes through many urban areas. About 7.18% land is under settlement. As per the land use data analysis about 7.21% of the land is under water bodies, about 3.59% land is under vegetation, 2.82% land is under dry river bed and rest of the land falls under other uses (refer Table 5.6 ).

As per USDA Triangular Classification System, overall soils of along NW -1 can be described as Sandy Clay and Clay Loam type. Soil quality has to anaysed in detail during EIA s tudies. 5.3.3.9 Cropping Pattern Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V The Ganga River with its fertile soil is having a great influence to the agriculture based economies of adjoining district along the NW -1. The Ganges and its tributaries provide a constant source of irrigation water cat ering to the agricultural needs of an extensive area along the NW -1. The major crops cultivated in that area include rice, lentils, sugarcane, potatoes, oil seeds and wheat. Along the banks of the river, the existence of swamps and lakes also provide a ric h fertile soil for crops like legumes, chillies, sesame, mustard, sugarcane, and jute. 5.3.3.10 Major Habitation along the NW -1 The major habitation located along of land resources indicates land use change particularly diversion of agriculture land for urbanization industr ies & infrastructure development. Though it is an ongoing phenomena, any new infrastructure development intervention is expected to accelerate it. 5.4 Ecological Profile 5.4.1 Biological Environment (NW -1) This Section provides detail of terrestrial a nd aquatic environment along NW -1, and influence area around NW -1. Ecological profile of the area has been described in terms of biogeographic zone followed by terrestrial & aquatic flora & fauna and the valued environment & social component. 5.4.1.1 Ecological Profile - Biogeographic Zone Biogeographic zone indicates area of animal and plant distribution having similar or shared characteristics throughout. NW -1 falls largely under Gangetic Plain Biogeographic zone (7) 12 and small section under Coast Bio geographic Zone (8). Biogeographically, the NW -1 falls in Gangetic plain Biogeographic zone which is divided in two biotic provinces namely Upper Gangetic plain (7A) and Lower Gangetic plain (7B)13. Gangetic Plain Zone (7A and 7B) consists of plains of UP , Bihar, West Bengal which is most fertile having alluvial soil. It is mostly under crop having very little forest cover. The trees belonging to these forests are teak, sal, shisham, mahua, khair etc. 12: Biogeographic classification is India is the division of India according to biogeographic characterstics. It is based on dist ribution of species (biology), organism and in ecosystem in geographic space. There are ten biogeographic zones in India namely 1. Trans Himalaya n Zone, 2. Himalayan Zone, 3. Desert Zone, 4, Semiarid zone, 5. Western ghat zone, 6. Deccan Plateau Zone 7. Gangetic Pl ain Zone, 8. North East Zone, 9. Coastal Zone 10. Island present near the shore line zone. 13: Biogeographic classification of India was done by Rodgers and Panwar (1988), describing 10 biogeographic zones in India, furt her divided into 25 biogeographic provinces. T he maps were further revised by Rodgers, Panwar and Mathur (2002), using GIS techniques into 10 zones and 26 provinces. The classification was done using various factors such as altitude, moisture, topography, and rainfall. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V Zone 8 (B) consists of Coastal belts of east coasts, h igher rainfall, and exposure to cyclones near sea coast, rich in flora and fauna exactly replicating the peninsular type of vegetation near estuary areas. Biodiversity of study area & NW -1 uniquely synthesizes two different eco -regions of India situated a long climatic gradients, namely, the Gangetic plains and the Deltaic regions in line with its Biographic classification. The unique biodiversity in the study area has been summarized in terms of Forest types and Valued Environment & Social Component. The r ivers biodiversity comprises periphytons, phytoplanktons and macrophytes which are consumers in the trophic level of energy pyramid and thus the real commercial products at tertiary level of food chain. 5.4.1.2 Forest type Data on forest and tree cover in states14 traversed by NW -1 indicates that forest and tree cover is highest in Jharkhand (32.74% of total geographical area) followed by West Bengal (21.35%), Bihar (10.04%) and Uttar Pradesh (8.82%) as given in Table 5.7 . Reserved forest map in the stat e traversed by NW -1 is provided in Figure 5.10 . No portion of NW -1 and intervention areas falls under any reserved forest or normal forests area.

Therefore, within 10 km of influence area, forest cover (if any) need to be conserved . 5.4.1.3 Valued Environment & Social Component in Project Area (NW -1) The Valued Environment & Social Component (VECs) namely Biosphere Reserves, Wildlife Sanctuaries, National Parks, wetlands, Tiger Reserves, Important bird areas, and Breeding and nesting grounds for a quatic species (Schedule -I species) are identified and mapped for entire NW -1 stretch due their importance for providing suitable habitats for wildlife, humans, and their role in sustaining ecological functions. There are 2 wildlife Sanctuaries, and four H ilsa Fish sanctuaries are located within river boundary of NW -1 stretch. Udhwa bird sanctuary and 5 other important bird areas are also located within 10 km radius of NW -1 stretch. Details of VEC's along NW -1 are described below. 5.4.1.4 Wildlife San ctuaries within NW -1 There are two notified wildlife sanctuaries namely Kashi Turtle Sanctuary and Vikramshila, Dolphin Sanctuary under Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 (amended as on date) and 4 Hilsa Sanctuaries located within the NW -1. Hilsa Sanctuaries h ave been notified under West Bengal inland Fisheries Rules, 1985 to propagate Hilsa Fish production.

In Uttar Pradesh, the Allahabad belt up to Gazipur is relatively sparsely occupied with variety of trees which are equally well present up to Farakka belt. However, the density of flora is relatively thin in U.P. & Bihar areas as compared to Jharkhand and West Bengal region. The Allahabad to Balia region comprises about 41 var ieties of macrophytes in present along the bank of river. Tree cover is formed by the Bihar, region is comprises of 7 shrubs spe cies, 41 herbs species, 6 grasses and sedges species, besides these a number of tree species along the banks of river is reported. The tree species in the stretch is mainly composed of Shorea robusta, comprising of 48 species in Diara land of Ganga and its tributaries are reported. The important species of this lan d 212 macrophytes have been reported along the river Ganga. From Bally to Bandel about 32 species of macrophytes have been reported which includes 7 species of Asteraceae, 4 species of Euphorbiaceae, 2 of Amaranthaceae and 3 of Cyperaceae, 2 of Polygonaceae and 1 of Poaceae. Tree species climatic condition of this region is humid, subtropical, and tropical. Humidity is less near Farakka as compared to Haldia. Farakka to Nawadip the riparian flora is similar as in Bihar stretch as it is freshwater flora zone. After Nawadip the salinity increase in river water due to estuarine affect the change in riparian flora is noticed. The tree species is mainly comprised of -1 The Allahabad to Farakka segment of River Ganga (LG -A) comprises a fresh water zone of 701 km. The floral and faunal diversity comprises phytoplankton, zooplankton, zoo -benthos including macro -invertebrates, fish and higher vertebrates. Phyt oplankton is represented by total of 270 taxa (91 sp. of Chlorophyceae, 81 sp. of Bacillariophyceae, 78 sp. of Cyanophyceae, 8 sp. of Euglenophyceae, 3 sp. of Chrysophyceae, 3 sp. of Xanthophyceae, 2 sp. of Dinophyceae, 2 sp. of Rhodophyceae, 1 sp. of Cryp tophyceae, 1 sp. of Synurophyceae). Zooplankton comprises of Protozoans (8 sp.), Rotifers (26 sp.) and Crustaceans (5 sp. of Copepods and 13 sp. of Cladocerans). In this stretch all groups are represented though are low in specific composition. The stretch supports the zoobenthos i.e. Insects (43%), Annelids (21%) and Molluscs (36%). Nematodes are also reported in the stretch. Fish in the stretch is represented by total of 121 species belonging to 35 families. Thirty five commercially important fishes are i ncluded in the taxa along with six invasive species. Beside the preponderance of fish species in this zone, an aquatic mammal, Gangetic dolphin is also present in the Bihar stretch. Fresh water turtle were also reported in Kashi turtle sanctuary area. 286 km of stretch of Lower Ganga downstream of Farakka up to and dominant algal in lower Ganga is Cyanophyceae followed by Chlor ophyceae. The zooplankton communities in lower Ganga basin are represented by members of Cnidaria (25 stitute Annelida (90 taxa), Arthropoda (Total 476 taxa;240 species of Crustaceans, 33 species of Arachnids, 201 species of insects and 2 species of Merostomata), Mollusca (Total 68 taxa) and Echinodermata (17 taxa). The Ichthyo -fauna is represented by 175 species, out of which 103 species, under 69 genera and 37 families are strictly estuarine in nature. The higher aquatic vertebrates observed in this stretch during study period are represented by turtles and dolphins. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V The higher aquatic t in NW -1 stretch (Lutrogale perspicillata ), vulnerable species. Among and Indian Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus ) and variety of turtle species. threatened species, Ganges Shark ( Glyphis gangeticus ), a critically endang ered species is known only from the lower reaches of the Ganges -Hooghli river system, West Bengal, India. It possibly occurs in other river systems in the area. It could also occur in shallow marine estuaries although there are no verified marine records o f this species to date16. Crocodile is found in upper Ganga region and in tributaries of Ganga river. Stray instances have been reported about presence of crocodile in Allahabad and Varansi area during rainy season. These animals have got fragmented due to construction of Narora Bar rrage. Ganges Shark presence has been reported in 18th sanctuary but its presence is doubtful in the river. Smmoth Coatted Otter is also reported to be found in upper Ganga reache s above Naraora Barage. It prefers wetland, rice paddy fileds and lake. Its presence has been reported in side channel of river Ganga near Bhagalpur. The prime species for further assessment is considered for Dolphin and Turtle which are largely found in NW-1 stretch and are of endangered category. Mitig ation measures likely to be proposed for these animals will be suitable for Crocodile and Smooth coated otter as we ll to a l arger extent. 5.4.2.2 Phytoplanktons & Zooplanktons Observed in Sanctuary Area along NW -1 Observations and existing literature ci tes that the Ganga river system has a rich diversity of both types of planktons i.e. phyto -plankton and the Zooplankton, though the diversity varies on account of local anthropogenic impacts from station to station. The diversity of planktons is slightly h igh in Hilsa Sanctuary than Kashi Turtle sanctuary and Vikramshila dolphin sanctuary area. The list of phytoplankton and zooplanktons, observed in Kashi Turtle sanctuary, Vikramshila Dolphin Sanctuary and Hilsa Sanctuary area along NW -1 is given in Table 5 .10 and Table 5.11 .

Among the zooplankton group, Brachionous sp.(Rotifera) had highest percentage composition and the lowest percentage composition was of Asplanchana sp. 5.4.2.3 Breeding and Spawning Fish Breeding and Spawning: Generally, fish breeding and spawning is most frequent in monsoon season (July to September).. It was found that spawning grounds of fishes are generally located in shallow parts of river meandering sit es, where water current is slow and depth is around 5 -10 cm. The genera of cat fish families like Mystus, Wallago and Clarias make a nest type breeding niche, which is looked after by male and where after a little time courtship female lays its spawn fo llowed by the release of milt leading to fertilization. .As per the situation, a small exploratory assessment was done to know the availability of fish spawn/ larvae along the study stretch using spawn collection nets during study period. The cone shaped s pawn collection nets were fixed against the water flow along the right and left edges of the NW -1 at each selected sampling site, for a duration of half an hour. The mass of spawn/larvae collected varied from site to site and were a mixture of different sp ecies of fishes distributed in the particular sites and the study indicated that fishes were breeding throughout the river stretch and the larvae and the spawns were abundant near river meandering points and shallow zones. The map showing likely breeding a nd spawning grounds at different stretch along the NW -1 is given in Figure 5.11 to Figure 5.14 .

It tolerates variations in salinity and travels over 1200 km in inland water for breeding upto Farakka. The Hilsa fish is heterosexual. Breedin g starts with start of monsoon in July and peaks in September -December. Hilsa is primarily restricted to the estuarine zone only and its migration has been stopped in fresh water zone beyond Farakka. Dolphin Breeding (reproduction): Calving of Gangetic D olphin generally occurs in December to January and March to May, though it can occur any time of the year. Newborn calves have been observed mainly in April and May17. Smooth -coated Otter (Lutrogale perspicillata ) is dependent on monsoons. It mostly breed between August and December. The gestation period is 61 -65 days. Smooth -coated otters give birth to and raise their young in a burrow or shelter near water, which they excavate, or they assume an abandoned one. Two to five cubs are born in a litter, blind and helpless. At thirty days, the cub's eyes open, and by sixty days, they can swim. The cubs disperse at about 1 year of age. Sexual maturity is reached at two years Turtle Breeding: Turtle nesting season vary depending on the species. Its hatching per iod normally confined between May to October. The nesting and hatching season of fresh water turtle vary from May to October. The Nesting and hatching season of fresh water turtle in NW -1 is given at Table 5.12 .

Usually a single calf is born, which is nursed for around 18 months with milk from the mother.Calves live close to th eir mothers for around 6 years. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V Basin level and project level water environment has been described in terms of hydrological status, river mobility, flow availability, water levels, sediment load, tributaries flow & their sediment load and least available depth for navigation. Each of these items have been described below both in terms of basin and project. Further, summary of surface and ground water quality have also been described below. 5.5.1.1 River Mobility River Ganga is significantly mob ile and changes flow pattern from one season to another.

Water resources potential of the basin is very approximate. The above data give an in dication of the critical status of water resources in India (and in the NRGB), especially when water demands are compared with the water resource potentials. The following points, however, are pertinent with regard to these data: a) How Approximate are the Water Resour ces Potential b) The above water estimates are for very large regions, and spatial variations of water resources potentials cannot be gauged from the above data. c) While clarity on these data and their interpretations are needed, it seems certain, however, that NRGB (like much of the country) is under increasing water stres s, which calls for major changes in how NRGBs wat er resour ces are managed. d) The projected water demands are for human use only, and do not give any indication of the water needed to sustain healthy functioni ng of the basin. e) Dams and barrages often help to meet several anthropogenic needs such as water supply, hydropower generation, flood control and navigation. But these obstru ctions have divided Nation al River Ganga and her tri butaries into small segments, thereby interrupting the flow of water, nutrient, sediments and aquatic sp ecies in the rivers. However, these are observed more in the upper reaches of ganga river. f) Strea mflow and evapotranspirat ion are the two main components of water outgo. It may be noted that, on an annual basis, the average ratio of eva potranspirat ion to precipitation is found to be about 41 -42%, w hich is much higher than the govern ment norm of 23% for the Ganga basin but much lower than 60%. g) The flow health scores had significantly altered in sever al stret ches of National River Ganga and her tributaries due to the present system of river wa ter management. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V However, t he analysis does not cover many aspects of river health such as functional needs of ecosystems and habitats. 2. Modelling results indicate that , while t he changes in flow volumes are very small in the headstreams of Nation al River Gan ga, river flows are considerably reduced in her major tributaries such as Yamuna, Gha ghra, Gandak, K osi, Chambal, Sone, etc., thereby reducing the flow in the main Ganga river through most of her reach. 3. The rivers suspended sediment load - generally esti mated at between 5 00 to 800 million T/yr. Most of the long-term sediment load in the Ganga river system derives from the Himalaya mountain range (especially from the High Himalay as), w ith probably less than 10% coming from the Siwaliks, plains and peninsular regions of the basin. 4. Many of the Himalay an tributaries of National River Ganga (such as the Kosi, Ghaghra, and Gandak) are k nown to carry enormous sediment loads, some of which tend to deposit on the plains during floods. Flooding is one of the most disastrous natural lphenomena in alluvial plains of Ganges system particularly in the eastern parts, which are presently regarded as one of the worst flood -affected regions in the world (Agrawal and Narain, 1996). The plains of north Bihar have the dublous distinction of recording the highest number of floo ds in India in the last 30 years (Kale, 1997). The Kosi river is an important tributary is an important tributary of the Ganga in the eastern India and one of the most distinctive hydrological characteristics of this river is a very high sediment yield (0. 43 mt/y/km2. The avulsive shifts of the Kosi river have been well documented and a preferentially westward movement of 150 kms in the last 200 years has been recorded. Unlike the previous westward shifts, the August 18, 2008 avulsion of the Kosi River re corded an eastward shift of ~120 km which is an order of magnitude larger than any single avulsive shift recorded in historical times. Data Analysis and Observation on Water Availability is given in Annexure 5.3 . In the upper stretches of NW 1, from Allahabad to Doriaganj, the river is meandering or sinuous with minor secondary branches and several chutes. The river shows a clear change of plan form typology at area around Patna to Munger. The change is from a meandering to an ana branching typology, wi th multiple channels. Change in planform is due to confluence of various tributaries namely Ghagra & Gandak in left bank and Son & Punpun in the right bank. The river typology changes again, downstream of Munger where the channel shows a sinuous channel wi th a certain degree of braiding. Bars are common in this area. Between Kahalgaon and Manihari the main channel clearly splits in two, with a certain degree of braiding in each channel. The contribution of the Kosi River takes place near Kahalgaon. From Man ihari to Farakka there is one main sinuous channel and several sinuous secondary channels. Downstream stretches of Farakka to Farakka lock and Farakka lock to Jangipur lock is an artificial canal. Reaches downstream of Jangipur Lock show a meandering chann el with different degrees of sinuosity, from tortuous to irregular meanders. From Jangipur Lock to Tribeni the presence of oxbow Lakes is common, and Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V cut-offs meanders18. Detailed morphology of the river in different reaches is given in Annexure 5.2. 5.5.1.2 Available Flow in NW -1 The Ganga River is characterised by high flows during the monsoon season, approximately from July until October, and low flows during the rest of the year.

In general, water levels are at their highest in August -September and sharply decrease in October -November. In general, they continue to decrease during the whole low flow season, from December to May, and start to rise again in Jun e-July. The variability of water levels during the dry season is lower than during the high season, with variations of the order of 2 -3m. The period of the year in which the minimum water level can occur varies with location along the river. In the upstrea m Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 EQMS -ABNAKI -IRG J V reaches from Allahabad to Ghazipur the minimum water levels occur from April to July. Downstream of the three major tributaries, Ghagra, Son and Gandak that join the river near Patna, the minimum water levels can occur between February and June as a resu lt of the influence of snow melt. Minimum & Maximum surface water levels at 7 gauging stations between Allahabad and Farakka for 3 annual probability of occurrence is given in Table 5. 17 & 5.18 & Figures 5.17 & 5.18 below.

According to the Admiralty Tide Tables (Ind ian Ocean 2015), there is an average spring tidal range of 4 to 4.8m at Haldia. The average spring tidal range on the NW -1 route reaches a peak at Diamond Harbour, of around 4.9m before diminishing with distance landward, such that it has reduced to about 4m in Kolkata, to 1.5 to 2.0m at Tribeni (IWAI 2012 NW -1 River Pilot), and effectively to zero at Nabadweep. The tides are predominantly semi -diurnal, with two high waters, and two low waters occurring during any 24 -hour period. The tidal conditions are largely governed by the (predictable) tidal cycles, but the river freshwater discharge influences the local conditions in the tidal stretch of the river significantly. In the tidal section of the waterway, in general terms, the water will continue to flow down -river on the ebb (falling tide). However, the flow direction is reversed to flow up - river on the flood (rising tide). 5.5.1.5 Sediment Load in NW -1 NW-1 comprises of the River Ganga and the tributaries system between Haldia and Allahabad. Rivers or iginating from the Himalaya region (Ganga, Ghaghara and Gandak) are characterized by a predominance of fine and very fine sand. The rivers draining from the Indian craton region (Tons, Son and Yamuna) bring much coarser sediments with higher contents of co arse and medium sand. Sediments are classified into suspended and bed load depending on the size of the particles. Sediments of diameter smaller than 125\u00b5m are transported in suspension and can be deposited during the low flow period. Sediment size decreas es from Allahabad to Farakka. Sediment load at different locations and tributaries of NW -1 is given below in Table 5. 19.

Ltd. (Design Consultant) 5.5.2 Tributaries Ganga River originates in the Ga ngotri Glacier at about 4, 000 m above sea level in the Indian state of Uttarakand. Its major tributaries include the Himalayan riv ers of the Yamuna, Mahakali, Karnali, Gandak, Kosi and Mahananda rivers flowing south from the Himalaya. These northern Himalayan tributaries rise primarily in Nepal and India, with some portions of the Kosi rising in China. Fr om the south, the tributaries of the Yamuna and the Tons and Son Rivers flow north from the Deccan Plateau into the main stem of the Ganga. The Deccan Plateau in the south of the Basin is generally at low elevation with hills up to 1,200 m. Other important tributaries are Goma ti, Ghaghara and Gandak from the North and Punpun from the south. Figure 5.19 shows the main tributaries along the River Ganga between Allahabad and Farakka. Figure 5.19: River Ganga and its tributaries in the region between Allahaba d and Farraka.

Singh et al (2007) reports that floods occur almost simultaneously in the River Ganga and its tributaries due to the concurrent monsoon conditions over the alluvial plain for a long period and the sim ultaneous heavy rainfall over the Himalaya. T ributaries may increase sediment concentration in the main river because of their sediment load or decrease it because of the dilution due to the increase in water discharge.

As per the surveys carried out by IWAI, depths available in NW-1 naturally are given below. Haldia to Tribeni (196 km) - LAD of 3m - throughout the year Tribeni to Farakka (364 km) - LAD of 2.5 m - 320 days Farakka to Ghazipur (690 km) - LAD of 2 m - 200 days Ghazipur to Allahabad (370 km) -LAD of 1.5 m -170 days IWAI is currently maintaining LAD for managing the navigation in NW -1 through dredging and bandalling.

This variation is very significant near riparian urban centres. As per \"Ganga River Basin Management Plan 2015, Mission 2 -Nirmal Dhara\", p ollutant ingress into the Ganga river system occurs in three ways, 1) by direct discharge of pollutants, 2) discharge of polluted surface runoff into rivers, and 3) seepage of polluted subsurface flows into river s. Dire ct discharge of pollutants into rivers oc cur due to, i) discharge of liquid wa stes generated from point sources into rivers, ii) dump ing of municipal and industrial solid waste, devoti onal offerings, animal carcasses, un- burned/partially burned human bodies, etc. into rivers, and iii) non-ritual bathing w ith the intention of cleaning body dirt, direct defecation, wa shing of clothes, washing of vehicles, washing/wallowing of animals, e tc. The origin of polluted non-point surface discharge into the Ganga river system are two fold, i) sur face runoff contai ning lea ched fertilizers a nd pesticides applied on agric ultural fields and ii) surface runoff contai ning entrained solid wa ste, i.e., garbage, industrial wa ste, human and animal feces, etc. Some portion of the liquid waste generated from both point and non-point sources described above infiltrat es into the subsurface a nd pollute the groundwater. Seepage of this polluted ground water also results in pollution of t he Ganga river system. Exami nation of Ganga water quality data in dicates that at Dev Prayag (conflu ence of rivers Bhagirat hi and Alaknanda) and furt her downstream, the fecal coliform numb ers in Ganga River are on an averag e, 100 times more than the levels acceptable for bathing. F inally, it is estimated that approximately 70 % of the volumetric pollution load on the Gan ga river system is from domestic/commercial sources, i.e., from human urine/feces and solid waste. Major polluting industries along river Gan ga are pulp and paper, sugar and distillery, tannery, textiles, etc. together with agric ultural pollution contri bute the remaining 30 % pollution load to the river. The same trend has been observed in the basin downstream of Allahabad. Further detailed status of water quality is given in Annexure 5.4. Water can be classified in five classes of best designated use (BDU) dependi ng upon its chemical properties. CPCBs BDU Criteria Standard in India is given in Table 5. 22. Ganga river quality data monitored by CPCB at different locations along NW -1 are shown in Table 5. 23 and shown in Figure 5.20 . DO & pH - meets the water qualit y criteria for bathing at most of the monitoring locations. DO vary from 4.8 -12.8 mg/l and found within water quality criteria of river. BOD ranges from 1.1 - 8.2 mg/l. The maximum value of BOD was recorded at Diamond harbour. Faecal Coliform values ranged from 230 -650000 MPN/100ml. The total coliform values ranged from 490 at Mirzpur to 85,0000 at Howrah. It is mostly above 5000 MPN/100ml/coliform limit for category C -designated best use requirement.

The extent of ground water utilization for irrigation is highest in Uttar Pradesh (45.36 BMC per year), followed by West Bengal (10.84 BMC per year), Bihar (9.39 BMC per year) and Jharkhand (0.7 BMC per year). Details of Gro und Water quality is not available in detail across the NW -1 stretch and the same shall be analysed in d etail during EIA studies. 5.6 Air Environment The ambient air quality data is not available for NW -1 stretch. Some data is available for certain cities. The Ambient air quality genrally is expected to be within the prescribed limits. However baseline ai r quality shall be monitoried and base level to be established for future references. 5.7 Meteorology & Other Climatic Parameter The main climatic factors of concern are temperature, sunlight and precipitation. In India, has four temperature zones namel y tropical, sub -tropical, temperate and alpine. Among these, the tropical zone(Humid, sub -tropical and Tropical wet and dry)is most predominant in the entire NW-1 stretch. The meteorological parameters also play a vital role in transport and dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere. Historical meteorological data were obtained from climatological tables pertaining to different IMD stations all along the NW -1. The met data of the nearest representative IMD stations all along the NW -1(period 1961 -1990) i s summarized in Table 5. 24 and Table 5. 25.

The predominant wind direction is from North and Northwest direction in winters and South and Southeast direction during rest of the season . 5.7.2 Rainfall The annual total rainfall in all IMD stations (representing respective city/towns) ranges between 1000.3mm at Varanasi and 1728.5 mm at Kolkata. Over 80% of the total annual rainfall at all locations is received during the monsoon perio d between June to September. 5.7.3 Relative Humidity The air is generally dry in the region except during monsoon. March and April are the driest months with relative humidity ranging between 25 -84%. Lowest humidity was observed in Varanasi (as per IMD r ecords) which slightly increased with decreasing altitude. The maximum humidity was observed during rainy season as reflected in data base of all IMD stations along NW1. 5.7.4 Temperature December and January constitutes winter months with daily mean mi nimum temperature of around 9.1 C at Patna (IMD Station) and daily mean maximum temperature of around 26.9 C at Kolkata. April and May are the hottest months with daily mean maximum temperature varying around 40.4 C at Varanasi and daily mean minimum tempe rature around 24 C at Malda (IMD records). 5.7.5 Barometric Pressures The station level barometric pressure at all IMD sites ranged between 997 to 1016.8 h Pa. The station level pressure is highest in winter months and low in during rainy season. 5.7.6 Day Time Length At Allahabad, the longest day of the year (falling in June) is of 13 hours 35 minutes of daylight. The shortest day (falling in December) is only of 10 hours 24 minutes long. Similarly, at Haldia (which is farther towards South, and clo ser to the equator), the longest day of the year is of 13 hours 29 minutes, and the shortest day is of 10 hours 47 minutes. 5.7.7 Visibility Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 152 Visibility is of key concern for safe navigation all along NW1. A review of climate date for a few key locations along the NW -1 route suggests that there are occasions with reduced visibility (characterised by the average number of days affected by fog). The time period over which fog is likely to affect the NW -1 route extends from October to March inclusive. There i s a subtle difference in the period of the year when fog is more likely to affect navigation on different locations particularly the locations falling nearer the coast (Haldia and Kolkata) are having a larger window over which fog could occur (October to M arch). Berhampur is having the narrowest window (January to March). The greatest probability of fog occurring at locations along the NW - 1 route is during January, the potentialinland locations (Patna and Varanasi) to be affected by fog on more than 50% of days during December and January. Visibility may also be reduced significantly during periods of heavy rain. During such conditions, the performance of vessel - mounted navigation aids, such as radar, may also be affected. Site specific Met Data at proposed terminals . Secondary one -month data was collated for terminal and Lock locations at Haldia, Farakka lock, Sahibganj and Varanasi. The analysis reflected that predominant wind direction all along NW -1 is from NW, WNW, E, S and SE direction. The prevalence of calm period ranges between 26 to 31%. Site specific met data and wind roses are given at Table 5. 30 and Figure 5.2 1.

Cyclone hazard prone areas of NW -1 are shown at Figure 5.2 1. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 153 Figure 5.21: Cyclone Prone Area Map of India showing NW -1 5.7.9 Tidal Surges Tidal surges are also important for navigation ease. There are no tidal surges observed in NW - 1 area from Allahabad to Farakka. Nearly halfway between Farakka and Sagar Island, Hoogly (Ganga) enters into the tidal zone of the Gangetic delta. The tide runs rapidly on the Hoogly, and tidal effect upto Kolkata (about 175 Km). 5.8 Socio -Economic Environment The socio -economic profile of districts/cities/towns of these states falling alo ng NW -1 are analysed to understand overall socio -economic environment around NW -1 project areas. 5.8.1 Demography Demography is one of the important indicators of environmental health of an area. It includes population, number of households, literacy, p opulation density, etc. Demographic profile of the area was analysed based on 2011 census data. 5.8.1.1 Population Distribution in Major Cities along NW -1 There are many cities, towns and villages located along the NW -1. As per the Census Record of Indi a 2011, the population of major cities/ town located along the Ganga River in NW - 1 section was recorded as 12875343 comprising 6782150 male and 6093193 females.

It provides the necessary silt in much of the land around it, increasing its fertility. Paddy is the greatest crop of the region. Agriculture is the main source of the l ivelihood generation for the people residing along the NW -1 area. Many towns in the area are primarily industrial. Ganga provides the necessary infrastructure for the factories to perform. Commercial fisheries in the Ganga River System are an important sou rce of livelihood for the people residing along the Ganga River. The Ganga in Allahabad and Varanasi is also considered to be the most auspicious. Thousands of devotee Hindus come to the Ghats to pray for their ancestors. Pilgrimage and the associated tour ism brings along a major source of revenue for religious towns and their people. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 161 5.8.4.1 Fishing and Livelihood Generation along NW -1 Ganga is the most important river and source of livelihood for countless fishers inhabiting on its bank. The fishery in the potamon zone of the river is mainly represented by the species belonging to Cyprinidae and Siluridae families. There is substantial decline in major carps fish catch in Allahabad to Farakka stretch over past few years. In recent period, the fishery showed some improvement due to emergence of exotic species, specifically C. carpio and O. niloticus. At Buxer hilsa was the main fishery and with the commissioning of Farakka barrage the fishery declined sharply between 1972 -80. Fishery improved during 1981 -86 due to improvement in landings of other species. Patna centre also showed drastic decline in major carp landings and as compared to sixties it was almost half during 1986 - 93. Decline at Bhagalpur was not as severe as at other centres. Gupta and Tyagi (1 991) have discussed the fishery of Ganga with an analytical approach and showed that the fishery is harvested at a level higher than the optimum fishing level and efforts should be made to reduce the fishing pressure to obtain a sustainable fishery from th e system. Fishermen Population and Fishing pattern: It is very important to know the total number of fishers involved in capture fisheries in the NW -1 stretch. It is reported that almost every village along the both sides of the river are having some fis hermen who earn their livelihood by fishing in the Ganga river. There is no census data available regarding fishers specifically involved in capture fisheries in the whole NW -1 stretch. Generally, one member of the family is engaged in fishing in lower str etch of NW -1(Farakka to Haldia), sometimes two, the average comes to be 1.5. However, in upper stretch (Allahabad to Farakka) the average person engaged in fishing is 1.2 that is mainly due to low fish catch in this stretch. The fishermen do fishing for 5 -12 hours daily, depending upon the season. Fishing activities is very less during monsoon season. Fishing is the main occupation to 90% of the fishermen, which contribute to more than 80% of their household income. Other major occupation includes fish vend ing, ferry service, tourism, driving and daily labour. Most of the fishermen do not have agricultural land and small amount of income comes from labour wage, service, and petty business. In the season of less catch the youth generally engage themselves in labour works or rickshaw van pulling to earn their livelihood. Fishing Income: The monthly average income of the fisherman ranged from Rs.4000 to 7000 per month in Allahabad to Patna stretch. However, in Varanasi stretch the most of the fisherman is enga ged in boating and ferry services now and earning more than fishing. In lower zone (Farakka to Haldia) the average income of fisherman is slightly high and ranging between 7000 to Rs. 10,000 per month because of higher catch and high value fish (mainly hil sa) in the catch. Fishing Crafts: For fishing purpose mainly small or medium sized boats was used. As compared to sixties, the availability of boats per fishermen showed an increase, this may be due to change in fishing pattern. As in past mainly dragnet s were used for fishing involving only two boats and more than 10 fishers in a fishing unit. With the passage of time dragnets Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 162 have lost their place and fishers have switched over to gill nets involving maximum 2 -3 persons and a boat. Single piece tin made fishing craft dingi are mostly found in Farakka and surrounding stretch and whereas the wooden boats/ big crafts are mostly found in the lower zone near Haldia. Nets & Gears: Dragnets, dip net, gill nets, traps, bag nets are commonly used by the fisher man along the NW -1 stretch. Gill nets availability was highest in Patna, Munger and Bhagalpur stretch of NW -1 and lower in Allahabad and Mirzapur stretch of NW -1. Availability of dragnets was low in almost Allahabad to Farakka stretches. Large dragnets were not present at all. Use of hook and lines were mainly in the Allahabad and Mirzapur stretches of NW -1 whereas traps were more in district Ballia and Bihar stretches. Small scoop nets were available in the entire stretch but large size was available only in lower stretches down to Farakka. Dip nets were observed in Allahabad and Mirzapur districts. Various forms of gill nets and bag nets are found to be operated by the fishers. Among them gill nets are most prevalent throughout the NW -1 stretch. Around 8 0% of the fishers were using the gear. The gill nets have different local names like Current jal, Nagin jal, Kajli jal, Phasa jal, Bhola jal, Gule jal, Pungus jal, etc. A number of variations in material and mesh size in g ill nets are observed depending upon the targeted fishes. However, drift gill nets are the major nets used to catch hilsa, the main migratory fish of Bhagirathi - Hooghly river system. All different types of gill nets have their distinct seasonality in oper ation depending upon the availability of the target species. Fishing sites and Jal/net operation in river: Most of the gears, bigger nets are operated inside the river for quite long time. Few bigger nets like Khelpa jal / Bachari jal and hooks can operat e from river bank. Gears, bigger nets are more frequently used by the fisherman near Farakka and downstream of Farakka to Haldia. However, the use of Gears and bigger nets is not so common in upper reach from Rajmahal to Allahabad. 5.8.5 Infrastructure Facilities along NW -1 The cities and towns along NW -1 has most of required infrastructure facilities. Infrastructural facilities namely Industries/industrial areas, transmission line, national highways, other roads, railways, settlement, cultural sites a nd archaeological site located within 500 either side of NW-1 is mapped using satellite imageries and limited physical verifications. These are presented in Annexure 5. 5. 5.8.5.1 Transport Network (Road/Rail/Water and Airways) All the towns and cities al ong the NW -1 are well connected with national highways, state highways, district roads, railways. Cities like Varanasi, Patna, and Kolkata are also connected with airways. Some of cities located along the NW -1 are connected with localised ferry services as well. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 163 5.8.5.2 Thermal Power plants along NW -1 Eleven thermal power plants are located in close proximity of river Ganga between Haldia and Allahabad and 10 more are reportedly are proposed to be set up in close proximity of the river. These terminal po wer plants have boosted the prospect of the waterway like never before for transportation of imported coal to these power stations. Transportation of coal to NTPC power plant at Farakka is already operational through NW - 1. 5.8.5.3 Current Pollution Load f rom Point Sources and its flow at Different Segment of NW-1 There are 30 class I cities and 8 class II towns along the mainstream of river Ganga at NW-1 segment. These cities are discharging 2173.8 MLD wastewater out of which only 959.6 MLD has the treatm ent Capacity. The City sewage discharge is major source of pollution to river Ganga which is another cause of declining fish catch in the river. Status of wastewater generation and treatment capacity in these cities is summarized in Table 5. 31 and detailed at Table 5. 32. Table 5. 31: Wastewater Generation and Treatment Capacity Category Wastewater Generation, MLD Treatment Capacity, MLD Class -I (30) CPCB report Status of Water Supply, Wastewate r Generation and Treatment in Class -I Cities Class -II Towns of India Table 5. 32: Sewage Generation of class Cities -I in River Ganga State City/Town Sewage Generation Santipur 18.7 18.7 Nabadwip 15.5 10 Basirhat 15.3 -- Bang aon 13.8 -- South dumdum 53 52.9 Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 164 State City/Town Sewage Generation (MLD) Treatment Capacity sonarpur Kamarhati 20.5 -- Ulberia 27.3 -- Kanchrapara 17 -- Halisahar 16.8 -- North Barrackpur 19.2 16.7 report Status of Water Supply, Wastewater Generation and Treatmen t in Class -I Cities Class -II Towns of India Waste water generation from cities and towns along NW -1 in Uttar Pradesh segment generated 422.6 MLD i.e. 26. % of total wastewater generation. Waste water generation from cities and towns along NW -1 in Bihar s egment is 376.5 MLD i.e. 14 % of total wastewater generation. The major city is Patna which generates 249.2 MLD of total waste water generated from this stretch. The cities/towns located along NW -1segment of West Bengal generate about 1311 MLD i.e. about 5 0 %. Out of the total waste water generation in NW -1 segment. Kolkata alone contributes47% and Howrah generates 10% of the total waste water generation of west Bengal stretch. 5.8.6 Cultural Activities and Religiously Important Places along NW -1 and Impo rtant Festivals Ganga River is worshipped in India and holds an important place as it is considered sacred and holy river in Hindu religion. Hindu people believe that holy dip in river Ganga washes their sins. This dip is considered more important at reli gious places at Allahabad and Varanasi located along NW -1. Hindus also believe that bathing in the river on certain special occasions and periods causes the forgiveness of sins and helps attain salvation. People also travel from distant places to immerse t he ashes of their kin in the waters of the Ganga. This immersion also is believed to send the ashes to heaven. Various festivals are organised on the bank of rivers at different places and different period. These festivals attract very large crowds and may have bearing even on movement of barges in NW -1 during festival periods. The list of culturally and religiously important places with its festivals along the NW -1 is given at Table 5.33. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 165 Table 5. 33: Culturally and Religiously Important Places with Fair a nd Festivals Sl. No. City Place Fairs & Festivals 1 Allahabad Sangam Kumbh Mela: The confluence of the 3 rivers Ganga, Jamuna and the sacred and mythological river Saraswati at Sangam is considered to be quite auspicious for the Hindus. It is said that when Lord Vishnu carried a pot or Kumbha of Nectar or Amrita, a fight broke out among the gods. In the milieu, four nectar drops fell on the earth at the four place which are known as the Tirthas and include Nasik, Haridwar, Prayad and Ujjain. These places are therefore considered as place where the mortal humans can pass on to a celestial world form the human world. In each of these locations, there is a kumbha mela held but on the 12th year, the mela is organized in Allahabad as it is considered the most sacred of the Tirthas. The Greatest Kumbha Mela is held in Allahabad which is also known as Maha Kumbha Mela and is the biggest fair related to religious practices. Magh Mela: Apart from the Maha Kumbh and another kumbh mela by the name the re is the Magh Mela. Maha kumbh is held every 12th year in the city of Allahabad which is a sacred city in the state of Uttar Pradesh. As because the Magh Mela falls during the period of Magh months of Jan and Feb, so the name has been given. During this period, the devotees take a holy bath at the confluence of the 3 rivers believing that the waters will wash away their sins. 2 Varanasi Ghats There are more than 100 ghats along the Ganga river at Varanasi (steps leading to the water of the Ganges). The banks of the Holy River at Varanasi are the most preferred cremation grounds. Ghats Panch This parikrama starts and finishes at Manikarnika Ghat and has the great importance in ancient Parikrama of India. The devotee will pass through the five great places thats why it has named so behind this. The five places of which the devotees have to round up and complete his Panch This festival is be ing celebrated in the months of October and November which is the tourism festival of Varanasi that is being celebrated from Prabodhani Ekadashi to Kartik Purnima (November month) ending by a dance presentation at Ganga Mahotsav. The rich cultural heritage of Varanasi is being reflected by this festival. Besides various cultural programs and the boat racing the martial arts are also presented. This festival also corresponds with another traditional festival of Dev Deepavali in which all the ghats of Varanas i are enlightened by thousands of Diyas. Dhrupad Mela: This mela is basically a music festival that is organized on the Tusli Ghat for five days (Feb or March month) in which the renowned artists of the area give there performances. This mela is especially famous among the foreign tourists. 3. Bihar & Jharkhand Ghats Chatth Puja: Chhath is an ancient Hindu festival dedicated to the worship of the Lord Sun in November month and is mainly celebrated in Bihar and Jharkhand on the banks of Ganga. 5.8.7 Tourism Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 166 The river is of great cultural and religious significance for the whole Indian peoples. All of this makes the Ganges a must for all tourists who wish to encounter all of Indias diverse beauty in terms of both culture and nature. There are many citi es along the banks of NW -1 specially Allahabad, Varanasi and Kolkata which are important from tourism prospective and attract thousands of religious and non religious tourists every year. Varanasi, a pilgrim place for Hindus and Buddhist alone attracts ove r one million pilgrims every year followed by Allahabad. 5.8.8 Existing Waste Management Facilities along NW -1 The municipal and bio -medical waste management facility is available at select cities only along the entire stretch of NW -1. Common Hazardous w aste facility is available only at Haldia in NW -1 area. The status of these facilities in select cities along the NW -1 is described below: Allahabad (Uttar Pradesh): Currently, the local body of Allahabad Municipal Corporation collects and dispose its th e municipal solid waste through Allahabad Waste Processing Company Pvt. Ltd (AWPCPL at Solid Waste Disposal Site (SWDS) located near Kareli which is about 4 km away from the Allahabad railway station and functions on composting technology. The compost that is produced from this plant will be supplied to local agricultural farms. Municipal solid waste treatment facilities in Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh): Varanasi Municipal Corporation (VMC) currently collects municipal waste and dispose off to unorganized dumpi ng site located 20 Km away from the city in Karsada. Construction of a treatment plant and organized landfill site is planned under JNNURM. Bio-medical waste treatment facilities in Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh): Varanasi Nagar Nigam has established Common B io Medical Waste Treatment Facility (CBWTF) at 310 -MohanSarai, National Highway and is well managed. Solid waste disposal Facilities in Patna (Bihar): Solid waste management is an overall responsibility of the Municipal Corporation as per Bihar Municipal act 2007 and MSW (management & Handling) rules 2000. Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) is responsible for development municipal waste land fill sites butit has yet to develop an organized land fill site. At present municipal waste is dumped to identify un organized dumping sites. Bihar Urban infrastructure development Corporation Ltd. (BUIDCO) has also initiated the process of an integrated Solid Waste Management process plant at Patna on PPP mode with power generation capacity of 8 MW electricity. Solid w aste Disposal in Bhagalpur (Bihar): No organized or bio medical waste disposal facility is available in this city. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 167 Solid waste disposal facilities in Kolkata (West Bengal): About 95% of total waste generated in Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) area is disposed at Dhapa landfill site and the rest at Garden Reach dumping ground. 700 TPD compost plant is set up by M/S. Eastern Organic Fertilizer Ltd. with technical back up of Excel Industry, Mumbai. Plant was set up and commissioned in the year 2000 and operated at 200 - 250 TPD capacity till 2003. Since 2003 Eastern Organic Fertilizer has stopped operating the plant because they are unable to sell the compost with reasonable profit margin and failed to meet their commitments towards KMC. Haldia (West B engal): The first Common Storage, Treatment and Disposal Facility (CSTDF) for hazardous waste under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) have been developed at Haldia. It is a joint venture project of Haldia Development Authority (HDA) and M/s Ramky Enviro Engineers April 2003, the HDA and M/s Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited formed a joined venture company under the name and style as M/s West Bengal Waste Management Limited to develop and operate the integrated waste management complex for taking care of the industrial hazardous wastes of West Bengal. Apart from these, the facility will also deal with the biomedical waste as well as municipal solid wastes for the adjacent municipal areas. 5.8.9 Water Borne Diseases Waterborne diseases increase where standards of water, sanitation and personal hygiene are low. Contaminated drinking -water is a frequent cause of diseases such as cholera, typhoid, viral hepatitis A and dysentery, malaria, dengue. The extent and effect of water born diseases in the s tates traversed by NW -1 are given at Table 5. 34 to Table 5. 37.

This zone has experienced various earthquakes in past an d have recorded high causality & loss of property. Occurrence of earthquake has potential to disturb & disrupt infrastructure, transportation, industrial operations, connectivity, communication etc, if occurs with severe intensity Flood: Area falls under ganga River water System. Ganga is Perenneial river. Ganga River has experienced and recorded several devastating floods. Similarly floods also have potential to disrupt all infrastructural, communication, industrial, electricity operations in the area: Immigration & Emigration: Whenever there are some developments in part of the state or country, there is possibility of movement of population to the activity zone in search of employment. Thus the areas proposed and identified as major development area may experience high immigration. Thus for these areas, infrastructural development is essentially to be taken in phasec manner as per requirement. Young/Work force population from rural areas may migrate into these regions. 5.10 Identification of Hotspots on Basis of Baseline Study From the above study, areas has been identified which are sensitive or the areas where status of VECs is critical. These areas are considered as hotspots which will experience maximum stress in future, i.e. post development of NW -1 and other identified developments. These identified Hotspots as per baseline study is given in Table 5. 39 below .

Baseline study has been carried out on the basis of secondary information collected from EIA/SIA study of NW -1, data from pollution control boards, IMD, Agricultural departments and other Governmental Organization. Baseline study has provided the details of condition of identifie d VECs along the NW -1 and of the district through which NW -1 traverse. This data has helped to identify the significance of the impact on the VECs condition and has provided the basis of carrying out the impact assessment study. Baseline study indicates NW 1 has flat terrain with vast catchment being drained by main river along with tributaries. Geologivcal influence area has alluvial soil and falls in Zone III & IV. Land use is largely agricultural land followed by water body, stllements with only 3.59 %veg etation. Turtle sanctuary Vikramshila Gangetic sanctuary are major VECs with Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin sanctuary & Udhwa bird sanctuary are protected areas. This area has diverse terrestrial & aquatic biodiversity with spawning & breeding grounds adjoining NW1. Flow analysis indicates that NW 1 has flow constraints in certain stretches considering CAD requirements. Overall soil type / quality along the NW -1 area is of moderately fertile and not expected to be detrimental to the growth of agricultural and forest crops. It can be concluded that soils fall within medium fertility levels in the entire stretch of NW -1and forms the basis of agriculture resources / cropping pattern. Assessment of land resources indicates land use c hange particularly diversion of agriculture land for urbanization industries & infrastructure development. Though it is an ongoing phenomena, any new infrastructure development intervention is expected to accelerate it. No portion of NW -1 and intervention areas falls under any reserved forest or normal forests area. Ecologically the area has important VECs. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 173 Udhwa bird sanctuary and 5 other important bird areas are also located within 10 km radius of NW-1 stretch. However, project interventions like maint enance dredging with alleviate the flow constraints for smooth operation of the barges, water availability analysis also indicates the river water is good for propogation of wild life and fesheries. Observations on River Bed -Dredge Material Quality indica te that the concentration level of heavy metal was found low and within acceptable limit as per standard (Criteria for Off -Shore Dumping of Dredged Material, USA) except cadmium which is slightly above the USA standard that may be due to industrial effluen t discharge in this section. Pesticide concentration in all samples were found below the USA criteria. The pesticides presence is on expected line as these are predominantly used for various agriculture applications. The source of these pesticide parathion and endosulphan might be from applications of insecticides and pesticides for agriculture in the study area which has significant agriculture land use. Air quality in terms of PM 10, PM 2.5 NOx SO 2 has been found high in major urban centers. The populat ion of major cities/ town located along the Ganga River in NW -1 section was recorded as 12875343 comprising 6782150 male and 6093193 females. Scheduled Caste population consisting of 544284 males and 483706 females respectively in major city/towns along t he study area and accounts for 7.9% of the total population. The Scheduled Tribe population consist of 27576 males and 25244 females respectively and accounts for 0.41% of the total population (12875343). About 75.4% of the population is literate and 23 .6% is illiterate in cities/town located along the NW -1 is illiterate. Male population is more literate than female. In cities and town along NW -1 area the main and marginal workers21 are 14% and 29% respectively while the remaining 57% of total population constitutes non -workers. The main occupation is agriculture, labour class and trading activities. Agriculture is the main source of the livelihood generation for the people residing along the NW -1 area. Many towns in the area are primarily industrial. Gan ga provides the necessary infrastructure for the factories to perform. Commercial fisheries in the Ganga River System are an important source of livelihood for the people residing along the Ganga River. Pilgrimage and the associated tourism brings along a major source of revenue for religious towns and their people. There is substantial decline in major carps fish catch in Allahabad to Farakka stretch over past few years. At Buxer hilsa was the main fishery and with the commissioning of Farakka barrage the fishery declined sharply between 1972 -80. Fishery improved during 1981 -86 due to improvement in landings of other species. Patna centre also showed drastic decline in major carp landings and as compared to sixties it was almost half during 1986-93. Decline at Bhagalpur was not as severe as at other centres. It is reported that almost every village along the both sides of the river are having some fishermen who earn their livelihood by fishing in the Ganga river. Generally, one member of the family is engage d in fishing in lower stretch of NW -1(Farakka to Haldia), sometimes two, the average comes to be 1.5. However, in upper stretch (Allahabad to Farakka) the average person engaged in fishing is 1.2 that is mainly due to low fish catch in this stretch. Fishin g Income: The monthly average income of the fisherman ranged from Rs.4000 to 7000 per month in Allahabad to Patna stretch. In lower zone 21A person who has worked for more than 183 days in a year is called the main wo rker. Marginal workers are those who have worked any time in the year preceding the census but have not worked for major part, which is not more than 183 days, of the year Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 174 (Farakka to Haldia) the average income of fisherman is slightly high and ranging between 7000 to Rs. 10,000 per month b ecause of higher catch and high value fish (mainly hilsa) in the catch. All the towns and cities along the NW -1 are well connected with national highways, state highways, district roads, railways. Cities like Varanasi, Patna, and Kolkata are also connect ed with airways. Eleven thermal power plants are located in close proximity of river Ganga between Haldia and Allahabad and 10 more are reportedly are proposed to be set up in close proximity of the river. There are 30 class I cities and 8 class II towns a long the mainstream of river Ganga at NW-1 segment. These cities are discharging 2173.8 MLD wastewater out of which only 959.6 MLD has the treatment capacity. The above mentioned baseline features provides basis for identification, classification & quant ification of impacts. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 175 CHAPTER 6: CUMULATIVE IMPACT ASSESSMENT 6.1 Introduction Cumulative impacts are those that result from the successive, incremental, and/or combined effects of an action, project, or activity (collectively referred to in this doc ument as \"developments\") when added to other existing, planned, and/or reasonably anticipated future ones. For practical reasons, the identification and management of cumulative impacts are limited to those effects generally recognized as important on the basis of scientific concerns and/or concerns of affected communities. Multiple and successive environmental and social impacts from existing developments, combined with the potential incremental impacts resulting from proposed and/or anticipated future dev elopments, may result in significant cumulative impacts that would not be expected in the case of a stand -alone development. Cumulative impacts are contextual and encompass a broad spectrum of impacts at different spatial and temporal scales. In this cas e, cumulative impacts occur because a series of projects of the same type and correlated to each other are being developed; for example, when several development projects are planned or constructed along the NW -1 or within the same stretch, when multiple r oads projects and railway projects are developed in close proximity, or when a number of logistic hubs, industrial areas are constructed or planned within the same flyway or region. Cumulative Impact Assessment study for NW -1 from Haldia to Allahabad has been carried out for basin (water environment & ecological environment) and 10 km area in both sides along the entire stretch. For the purpose of CIA, VEC s has been identified to assess their existing conditions in previous chapter so as the probable impa ct & significance of the impacts on these VEC s can be evaluated. Below sections provides details of anticipated cumulative impacts due to NW -1 development, existing/past developments and proposed/planned developments. 6.2 Basin Level Cumulative Impact Ass essment for Water Environment and Eco - system Services Based on the Baseline assessment of water environment & ecological services basin level cumulative impact assessment has been carried out some of the major impact has been carried out are described bel ow. Water availability in the Ganga river system is stressed. Further, the innumerable intercepts in the Ganga river network have f ragmented the once unified r iver network into disjointed Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 176 stretches of flowing and stagnant water s. Any further new interce pts will further stress as well fragment the river further. This will also lead to potential impact on the health of river and the associated ecosystem. Improper disposal of 1) s olid wastes and 2) liq uid wastes adversely impact water quality of the Ganga system. Further, non availability of required flow also impacts water quality of Ganga system 6.3 Finalization of VECs Specific Hotspots For purpose of CIA study an influence zone is identified where cumulative impact due to NW-1 and other developments within this zone will be identified. Through preliminary desktop study, baseline study and stakeholder consultations the existing developments in influence area, baseline scenario of the influence area, pollution load in environmental area, planned and ant icipated developments in influence area are identified. It is found that some zones are experiencing/will experience more of the above mentioned developments as compared to other zones. Such zones are demarcated on the basis of quantam and nature of develo pments the zone is experiencing or will experience in future. These zones are termed as hotspots as the impacts due to existing/planned development will be maximum/more in these zones as compared to other zones. Table 6.1 represents the hotspots demarcated on the basis of preliminary selection, baseline study and stakeholder consultations along with criteria for selection of hotspots and VEC s to be impacted in each zone. These hotspots are also marked on the maps and are given in Figures 6.1 -6.13. Cumulativ e impacts due to the identified developments will be assessed specifically in these hotspots.

NW -1 traverses through major cities which are highly populated. Various festivals and religious rituals are associat ed with the River Ganga. Developments like TPPs & industrial areas also exist along the NW -1. Total 5 bird areas and 3 eco-sensitive zones, i.e. Kashi turtle sanctuary, dolphin sanctuary & Udhawa sanctuary exists within 10 km of the NW -1. As per the EIA/SI A studies carried out for the project, it is found that the project has potential to impact various VEC s in its different stages. As per the baseline study and stakeholder consultation carried out, it is found that there are already significant developmen ts in the influence area of NW -1 and several other developments are planned. Those developments are and may be development of Eastern Dedicated freight Corridor (within influence area near Varanasi MMT), Industrial areas, TPPs, Roads, Indian Railways line/ ROB/RUB, Expansion and development of and within urban areas and irrigation schemes/dams. All of these developments also have potential to impact VEC s at different stages. The impacts due to proposed Jal Marg Vikas project and these mentioned developments is given in Table 6.2 below.

It has been identified that nature of impact varied from low to moderately high. For example Varanasi, Patna and Howrah, air quality of the area is already impacted due to high PM 10 concentration. Varanasi turtle sanctuary and Dolphin sanctuary are the eco -sensitive zones in NW-1 which are being impacted due to existing development and will be impact ed due to development of NW -1 and other upcoming and planned development in the area. Other areas like Barh, Danapur, Bhagalpur etc are sensitive due to presence of important bird area. Varanasi will be the common station of upcoming EDFC and NW -1 ad excha nge of material will be taken place between these two points. Depending on the sensitivity of the area and nature of existing & upcoming developments in the area, certain zones are declared as hotspots. Total 14 zones are identified as hotspots. Rating is provided to impact of each identified activity on VEC s and it is found that impact on these hotspots due to existing, planned and upcoming development varies from low to moderate. As per the impact assessment it is also found that the identified impacts ca n be mitigated and mitigation plan for the impacts is described in detail in Chapter 7. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 238 CHAPTER 7: STRATEGIC EVALUATION & RECOMMENDATIONS 7.0 Introduction and Background This chapter provides strategic evaluation and recommendations to address cu mulative impacts which are predicated on baseline status of identified VECs and impacts thereon. Identified VECs broadly are Physical environmental services and natural processes, Cultural Aspects of Ganga, Ecosystem services and Socio Economic Conditio ns. Components of VECs have been described below in terms of its baseline status, possible impacts on VECs, strategic recommendations and responsibility for implementation. 7.1 Water (Physical Environment Services & Natural Processes) 7.1.1 Baseline Sta tus of VECs As per Ganga river basin management plan - 2015 mission 1 Aviral Dhara hydrological status of NRGB, the total water resources potential is 525 BCM with a replenish able ground water potential of 171 BCM and utilizable surface water resources o f 250 BCM. These figures are very approximate. As described in section 5.5.1.1, Chapter 5, t he critical status of water resources in India (and in the NRGB), especially when water demands are compared with the water resource potentials. The Ganga river b asin is under increasing water stres s, which calls for major changes in how NRGBs wat er resour ces are managed. The projected water demands are for human use only, and do not give any indication of the water needed to sustain healthy functioni ng of the basin. Other observations from NRGB report are summarized below. a) Dams and barrages often help to meet several anthropogenic needs such as water supply, hydropower generation, flood control and navigation. But these obstru ctions have divided National River Ganga and her tri butaries into small segments, thereby interrupting the flow of water, nutrient, se diments and aquatic sp ecies in the rivers. However, these are observed more in the upper reaches of Ganga river. b) Strea m flow a nd evapotranspir ation are the two main components of water outgo. It may be noted that, on an annual basis, the average ratio of eva potranspirat ion to precipitation is found to be about 41 -42%, w hich is much higher than the govern ment norm of 23% for the Ganga basin but much lower than 60%. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 239 c) The flow health scores had significantly altered in sever al stret ches of National River Ganga and her tributaries due to the present system of river wa ter management. However, t he analysis does not cover many aspects of river health such as functional needs of ecosystems and habitats. d) The changes in flow volumes are very small in the headstreams of Nation al River Ganga, river flows are considerably reduced in her major tributaries such as Yamuna, Ghaghra, Gandak, K osi, Chambal, Sone, etc., thereby reducing the flow in the main Ganga river through most of her reach. This is on account of the current practices of water management in the basin. In the NW 1 stretch, rapid increase and fall of discharges has been observed during Ju ly and September -October at two locations: Varanasi (Chainage 1311) and Farakka (Chainage 583). Average discharge increase downstream during the high season (July to November). In addition to the significant seasonal variation within 7 years, there is also a great variability between years. The report \"Status on River Ganga: State of the Environment and Water Quality\" from the National River Conservation Directorate (2009) provides useful information in terms of understanding water discharges along the ups tream reaches of NW -1. Variability of monthly water levels, which can be of the order of 10 m during the high season. In general, water levels are at their highest in August -September and sharply decrease in October -November. In general, they continue to d ecrease during the whole low flow season, from December to May, and start to raise again in June -July. The variability to water levels during the dry season is lower than during the high season, with variations of the order of 2 -3 m. Many tributaries of G anga namely, the Tons, Son, Gomati, Ghaghara, Kosi meets Allahabad. Drainage pattern of the NW -1 is controlled by these rivers. By the time Ganga reach the head of its delta at Farakka (after Rajmahal) in the state of Jharkhand, its water flow and volumes increases substantially due the contribution from these tributaries. Its water quality and sediment load also fluctuate depending on the composition of the contributing stream. Beyond Farakka, the Ganga River bifurcates into the Padma and the original channel of the Ganga, known as the Bhagirathi. Tributaries also contribute sediment to the river Ganga. Literature cites that floods occur almost simultaneously in the River Ganga and its tributaries due to the concurrent m onsoon conditions over the alluvial plain for a long period and the simultaneous heavy rainfall over the Himalaya. Tributaries may increase sediment concentration in the main river because of their sediment load or decrease it because of the dilution due t o the increase in water discharge. Details of sediment quantity has been discussed in Annexure 5.3 . The extent of ground water utilization for irrigation is highest in Uttar Pradesh (45.36 BMC per year), followed by West Bengal (10.84 BMC per year), Bihar (9.39 BMC per year) and Jharkhand (0.7 BMC per year). Ganga River has experienced and recorded several devastating Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 240 floods. Similarly floods also have potential to disrupt all infrastructural, communication, industrial, electricity operations in the area. Literature cites that f looding is one of the most disastrous natural phenomena in alluvial plains of the Ganges system particularly in the eastern parts, which are presently regar ded as one of the worst flood-affected regions in the world. The Kosi river is an important tributary of the Gan ga in the eastern India and one of the most distinctive hydrological characteristics of this river is a very high sediment yield (0.43 mt/y/km2) The av ulsive shifts of the Kosi river have been well documented and a prefere ntially west ward movement of 150 kms in the last 200 years has been recorded. Unlike the previous westward shifts, the August 18, 2008 av ulsion of the Kosi River recorded an eastward shift of ~120 km which is an order of magnitude larger than any single avulsive shift recorded in historical times. Pollutant ingress into the Ganga river system occurs in three ways, 1) by direct discharge of pollutants, 2) discharge of polluted surface runoff into rivers, and 3) seepage of polluted subsurface flows into river s. Dire ct discharge of pollutants into rivers oc cur due to, i) discharge of liquid wa stes generated from point sources into rivers, ii) dump ing of municipal and industrial solid waste, devoti onal offerings, animal carcasses, un- burned/partially burned human bodies, etc. into rivers, and iii) non-ritual bathing w ith the intention of cleaning body dirt, direct defecation, wa shing of clothes, washing of vehicles, washing/wal lowing of animals, e tc. As per NMCGs document, Mission 2, Nirmal Dhara, approximately 70 % of the volumetric pollution load on the Gan ga river system is from domestic/commercial sources, i.e., from human urine/feces and solid waste. Major polluting industries along river Gan ga are pulp and paper, sugar and distillery, tannery, textiles, etc. together with agric ultural pollution contri bute the remaining 30% pollution load to the river. Basic water quality indicators indicators show spike in values near major urban centres. Details of water quality data in the Gang a basin has been described in Annexure 5.4 . Along the NW 1, there are 30 class I cities and 8 class II towns along the mainstream of river Ganga at NW -1 segment. These cities are discharging 2173.8 MLD wastewater, out of which only 959.6 MLD has the treat ment Capacity. DO & pH meets the water quality criteria for bathing at most of the monitoring locations. DO vary from 4.8 -12.8 mg/l and found within water quality criteria of river. BOD ranges from 1.1 -8.2 mg/l. The maximum value of BOD was recorded at Di amond harbour. Faecal Coliform values ranged from 230 -650000 MPN/100ml. The total coliform values ranged from 490 at Mirzpur to 85,0000 at Howrah. It is mostly above 5000 MPN/100ml/coliform limit for category C -designated best use requirement. Data ana lysis and observation on surface water quality at project intervention areas & sensitive location areas indicate that water quality meets with BDU Class D Criteria of CPCB barring few parameters PH, DO which meets A class criteria . Metallic and pesticide level is within prescribed limit of Drinking water standard. The analysis concludes that the river water is good for propagation of Wildlife and fisheries. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 241 7.1.2 Possible Impact on VECs Impacts described Chapter 6 indicate s water availability to sustain short term and long term health of the river is a big challenge. Further, variation of climatic conditions due to climate change e.g. drought & flooding further aggravates the stress on available water resources in the basin. Improper disposal of 1) s olid wastes and 2) liq uid wastes adversely impact water quality of the Ganga system. Further, non availability of required flow also impacts water quality of Ganga system. 7.1.3 Strategic Recommendations As per Ganga River Basin Plan -2015, Mission 1: Avir al Dhara, the main recommendations include: Water Availability: c) Ganga basin suffers from stress on water resources. N RGBs present hydrological status is very inadequately known, especially in terms of water availability and usage. The hydrological stat us needs to be determined afresh both temporally and spatially. (2) NRGBs water resource management plan must adopt distributed water storage in t he basins groundwater, lakes, tanks and ponds, and promote wetla nds and forests.(3) Increasing anthropogenic water usage needs to be checked by increased water use efficiency through realistic pricing of fresh water, incentives, techn ical assistan ce, allocation of water rights and entitlements to stak eholders, and promotion of water reuse and recycling. (4) A major policy shift in NRGBs water resource management should bring it under the ambit of natural resource management in the basin with emphasis on resource preservati on before exploitation, decentralized stakeholder contro l, and expert guidance and regulation.(5) All existing and future dams/ barrages must ensure longitudinal river connectivity and environmental flows (of water, sediments and other natural constit uents), and new projects should be approved or rejected on this basis. Efforts should be made to ensure environmental flows along the stretch of the river catering to environmental and social needs (ghats) of the basin (6) Increasing water withdrawals must be checked on a priority basis in critical regions.(7) The sediment resources of the Ganga river system need monito ring on a long-term basis and assessed comprehensibly in terms of both quantity and quality. The quantity and nutrient value of sediments trapped behind dams also need to be assessed, and nutrient-rich sediments need to be delivered to downstream river stre tches and floodplains.(8) Some major research needs include the determination of ecological limits, thresholds and interconnections of water resources in NRGB, and river flow health assessm ents within the framework of ecohydrology. d) Further, climate change scenarios with recommendations on adaptation & mitigation strategies should be made part of recommendation a) Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 242 These recommendations remain valid for NW 1 stretch downstream of Allahabad both at basin level segment wise distri bution of main stem of the river as well as for tributaries. This is essential considering requirement of flow, minimum depth of water & water levels required for smooth operation of NW both present and in future. All options should be explored at the pla nning, design and engineering stage to minimize the requirement of storage structures on the main stem of the river as well as on tributaries downstream of Allahabad. Further, options should be explored to operate using vessels/ barges requiring least avai lable depth as well as with least operational dredging requirements in line with international best practices. Further, continuous flow, depth and sediment monitoring is required along NW 1 and form part of the river monitoring framework Water Quality: e) As per Ganga River Basin Plan -2015, Mission 2:Nirmal Dhara, the list of activities to be prohibited in Ganga Basin include: 1) discharge of sewage (either treated or untreated) from Class I towns, either directly or in directly, into any river; 2) discharge of industrial effluents (either treated or untreated) from any large, medium or cluster of small industries, either directly or in directly, in to any river; 3) direct injection of sewage and industrial effluents (either treated or untreated) into the subsurface; 4) disposal of un-burnt and partially burnt corpses and animal carcasses in any river or riverbank; 5) open defecation and dump ing of municipal/industrial solid wastes or slu dge in any river or its a ctive flood plain; 6) Constru ction of new permanent structures in river flood plains for resid ential, commercial and industrial purposes, but excluding bridges and associat ed roads, jetties/g hats and hydraulic structur es for storage /diversion/control/c hannelizati on of river waters. f) Certain a ctivities must be gradually restric ted, i.e., permitted only with adequate safeguards or even prohibited in future. The list of restricted activities in clude, 1) discharge of sewage (either treated or untreated) from Class II town and smaller towns a nd villages, either directly or in directly, into any river; 2) disposal of sludge derived through treatment of sewage and industrial ef fluents except in secure landfills/hazardous waste sites; 3) discharge of industrial effluents (either treated or untreated) from small scale industry i nto any river; 4) disposal and/or discharge of mining and constru ction debris in any rivers flood plain, river bank or the river itself; 5) river bed farming and agric ultural activities in the active flood plain of any river; 6) ritual immersion of idols, and floral and other offerings in any river; 7) wallowing of domestic animals, washing of clothes, vehicles, etc., in any river; 8) widespread use of chemical fertilize rs and pesticides in agriculture, horticulture, aquaculture, animal husbandry, forestry, e tc. in NRGB. Therefore, there is a need for urban river management plan for restoration of natural dra ins in C lass I and Class II towns, s ewage treatment in Class I and Class II towns using Z LD sy stem, reuse/r ecycling of treated sewage in Class I and Class II towns, use of treated sewage for restoration/c reation of surface water bodies, use of treated sewage for irrigation, sewage management in new/existing colonies, housing societies using ZLD syst em, Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 243 zero-liquiddischarge (ZLD) systems for large/m edium industries, including TDS management, pr evention of disposal of corpses/human remains and animal carcasses in rive r, riverbank or river floodplain, pr evention of open defecation in river, riverbank or river floodplain in Class I and Class II towns, Removal of stray (e.g., dogs) a nd domestic ated animals (e.g., cows, bu ffaloes, pigs, etc.) from river, riverbank or river floodplain in Class I and Class II towns, prevention of disposal of municipal and industrial solid waste in river, rive rbank or river floodplain in Class I and Class II towns, pr evention of disposal of mining and construction debris in river, rive rbank or river floodplain, co ntrol of activities such as imm ersion of idols, floral and other offerings, wal lowing of domestic animals, washing of clothes, vehicles in Class I and Class II towns, river-frame restoration and development in Class I and Class II towns &river floodplain restoration in Class I and Class II town. g) Water pollution mo nitoring capacity and capability of different agencies need to be augmented. These recommendations are also applicable in the NW 1 river stretch from Allahabad to Farakka. Terminal locations should be selected to optimize construction requirements based on principles of 3Rs and zero waste discharge. 7.1.4 Responsibility for implementation Recommendation a) is being implemented in a disintegrated manner at central level by agencies like CWC, MoEF, NMCG, IWAI and at a state level by irrigation/ water resourc es department from time to time and limited to certain stretches of Ganga basin. Therefore, there is a need for adopting an integrated and holistic approach by synergizing efforts at central and state level. IWAI should augment and synergize its design and engineering capacity and capability for their operational requirements in line with recommendation a). Recommendations b) and c) are being already implemented by NMCG both at central and state government level under NMCG, Clean India Mission (Swach Bha rat Urban/ Rural & AMRUT), Smart City Program by a number of agencies. IWAI can synergize with these agencies by adopting ZLD approach from their vessels and terminal buildings. Further, they can monitor ZLD and 3R based approaches by using innovative app roaches e.g. how much tariff the barges/ vessels have paid for their liquid and solid waste discharge at terminal sites. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) monitor pollution related data for Ganga river system . However, all the tributaries are not covered under their monitoring programs. There is a need to augment capacity and capability of these agencies. Further, IWAI can compliment this effort by monitoring river water quality both upstream and downstream of their terminal locations as well in critical stretches/ restricted stretches identified in basin level report. This monitoring can be institutionalized by integrating environmental and social indicators as part of their information system. 7.2 Terrestria l Biodiversity Values Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 244 7.2.1 Baseline Status of VECs Biogeographic Zone Biogeographic zone indicates area of animal and plant distribution having similar or shared characteristics throughout. NW -1 falls largely under Gangetic Plain Biogeographic zone ( 7) 22 and small section under Coast Biogeographic Zone (8). Biogeographically, the NW -1 falls in Gangetic plain Biogeographic zone which is divided in two biotic provinces namely Upper Gangetic plain (7A) and Lower Gangetic plain (7B)23. Gangetic Plain Zon e (7A and 7B) consists of plains of UP, Bihar, West Bengal which is most fertile having alluvial soil. It is mostly under crop having very little forest cover. The trees belonging to these forests are teak, sal, shisham, mahua, khair etc. Zone 8 (B) consi sts of Coastal belts of east coasts, higher rainfall, and exposure to cyclones near sea coast, rich in flora and fauna exactly replicating the peninsular type of vegetation near estuary areas. Biodiversity of study area & NW -1 uniquely synthesizes two dif ferent eco -regions of India situated along climatic gradients, namely, the Gangetic plains and the Deltaic regions in line with its Biographic classification. The unique biodiversity in the study area has been summarized in terms of Forest types and Valued Environment & Social Component. The rivers biodiversity comprises periphytons, phytoplanktons and macrophytes which are consumers in the trophic level of energy pyramid and thus the real commercial products at tertiary level of food chain. Forest type Data on forest and tree cover in states24 traversed by NW -1 indicates that forest and tree cover is highest in Jharkhand (32.74% of total geographical area) followed by West Bengal (21.35%), Bihar (10.04%) and Uttar Pradesh (8.82 %). No portion of NW -1 and intervention areas falls under any reserved forest or normal forests area. Reserved Forest The vegetation type of the Ganga basin is largely tropical moist and dry deciduous types of forest, but also includes sub -tropical coniferous, Himalayan dry tem perate and Himalayan moist temperate forests types. 22: Biogeographic classification is India is the division of India according to bioge ographic characterstics. It is based on distribution of species (biology), organism and in ecosystem in geographic space. There are ten biogeographic zones in India namely 1. Trans Himalayan Zone, 2. Himalayan Zone, 3. Desert Zone, 4, Semiarid zone, 5. Wes tern ghat zone, 6. Deccan Plateau Zone 7. Gangetic Pl ain Zone, 8. North East Zone, 9. Coastal Zone 10. Island present near the shore line zone. 23: Biogeographic classification of India was done by Rodgers and Panwar (1988), describing 10 biogeographic zo nes in India, further divided into 25 biogeographic provinces. The maps were further revised by Rodgers, Panwar and Mathur (2002), using GIS techni ques into 10 zones and 26 provinces. The classification was done using various factors such as altitude, moisture, topography, and rainfal l. 24State of Forest Report, 2013 Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 245 Terrestrial Biodiversity Terrestrial Biodiversity describing riparian flora of the Ganga for NW -1 has been reported state wise into two main stretches of Allahabad to Farakka stretch and Berhampur to H aldia stretch. In Uttar Pradesh, the Allahabad belt up to Gazipur is relatively sparsely occupied with variety of trees which are equally well present up to Farakka belt. However, the density of flora is relatively thin in U.P. & Bihar areas as compared to Jharkhand and West Bengal region. The Allahabad to Balia region comprises about 41 varieties of macrophytes in which some species procera and Polygonum plebeium are present along the b ank of river. Tree cover is formed by the riparian flora in Bihar, region is comprises of 7 shrubs species, 41 herbs species, 6 grasses and sedges species, besides these a number of tree species along the banks of river is reported. The tree species in the stretch is mainly composed comprising of 48 species in Diara land of Ganga and its tributaries are reported. The important species of this land 212 macrophytes have been reported along the river Ganga. From Bally to Bandel about 32 species of macrophytes have been reported which includes 7 species of Asteraceae, 4 species of Euphorbiaceae, 2 of Amaranthaceae and 3 of Cyperaceae, 2 of Polygonaceae and 1 of Poaceae. Tree species mainly climatic condition of this region is humid, subtropical, and tropical. Humidity is less near F arakka as compared to Haldia. Farakka to Nawadip the riparian flora is similar as in Bihar stretch as it is freshwater flora zone. After Nawadip the salinity increase in river water due to estuarine affect the change in riparian flora is noticed. The tree species is mainly comprised of is Alternanthera philoxeoroides, Amaranthus spinosus, Cumulative Impact Assessment Report . Environment & Social Component in Project Area (NW -1) The Valued Environment & Social Component (VECs) namely Biosphere Reserves, Wildlife Sanctuaries, National Parks, we tlands, Tiger Reserves, Important bird areas, and Breeding and nesting grounds for aquatic species (Schedule -I species) are identified and mapped for entire NW-1 stretch due their importance for providing suitable habitats for wildlife, humans, and their r ole in sustaining ecological functions. There are 2 wildlife Sanctuaries, and four Hilsa Fish sanctuaries are located within river boundary of NW -1 stretch. Udhwa bird sanctuary and 5 other important bird areas are also located within 10 km radius of NW -1 stretch. Details of VEC's along NW -1 are described below. Wildlife Sanctuaries within NW -1 There are two notified wildlife sanctuaries namely Kashi Turtle Sanctuary and Vikramshila, Dolphin Sanctuary under Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 (amended as on date) and 4 Hilsa Sanctuaries located within the NW -1. Hilsa Sanctuaries have been notified under West Bengal inland Fisheries Rules, 1985 to propagate Hilsa Fish production.

Therefore, within 10 km of influence area, forest cover (if any) need to be conserved. 7.2.3 Strategic Recommendations 25 These IBAs have been identified by Bird Life International under its BirdLife Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) Programme Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 248 Pre-Construction/Design and Construction Stage Development of the civil interventions will require clearing of the vegetation from the proposed site. No significant vegetation is present at Farakka lock, Haldia terminal and Varanasi terminal site. But app.500 trees are present at identified terminal site in Sahibganj. Mango o rchards are present at the planned terminal site at Sahibganj. No wildlife is reported or observed during the visit at the proposed sites. Thus no impact on wildlife is anticipated during construction phase of the project. However, avifauna of the area may be impacted due to loss of their habitat (trees), majorly at Sahibganj site. But the site is surrounded by agricultural land and mango orchards thus sufficient habitat is present for the avifauna. Large number of tree may require felling. It is recomonde d to plant 7 trees against every trees to be cut. Translocation of trees proposed to be felled should be attempted as per the feasibility. Trees after growing up will provide excellent habitat to avifauna and insects. Also it is proposed to develop thick peripheral green belt and avenue plantation at each of proposed civil intervention site. This will help in improving the ecology of the area. For development of the project, project site may be required to excavated and filled which may impact the micro -fauna & flora residing within the soil. Also riparian fauna/flora is also likely to be affected due to project development but since construction phase is temporary and short term thus it is likely for vegetation to recover after removal of disturbance or completion of construction activities. Thus the impact anticipated due to project design & construction on terrestrial ecology are low -moderate. Also during the construction of project the transportation of heavy vehicle carrying the construction material will move in the project area. It will generate dust and noise during movement. The dust will be settled on the nearby flora of the roads and adjoining area, and covering the leaf and hence reducing the photosynthetic activity. Noise created due to increa sed traffic will have impact on the nearby fauna, it may have impact on the nocturnal animals/birds also. However, impact is anticipated to be short term and temporary and will be restricted to construction phase only. None of the planned intervention si te is proposed within eco -sensitive zone. Eco -sensitive zones within 10 km radius of the NW -1 alignment are Udhwa lake bird sanctuary, Farakka barrage & surrounding areas, Mokama Taal Wetlands and Kurseala River Course, Diyara Flood Plains and Danapur cant onment area. No impacts are anticipated on flora/fauna of these areas during construction & design phase as no construction activities are proposed within the river stretch along these areas. Operation Stage Positive impact on ecology is anticipated dur ing the operation stage of planned interventions majorly. Thick peripheral green belt will be developed and avenue plantation will be carried out at all the proposed intervention sites. Green belt will provide excellent habitat to avifauna, insects, small animals like squirrels, lizards, chameleons etc. But as the interventions like Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 249 terminals and jetties involve movement of vehicles at and around the site, dust level may increase in the area. This dust when settles on the leaves of the trees will hamper the photosynthesis activity. 7.2.4 Responsibility for implementation IWAI, PMU and Contractors will have direct responsibility for effective implementation and internal monitoring of environment management plan and mitigation measures. Compliance to cond itions as set out by various regulatory authorities will be monitored by concerned regulatory authorities. 7.3 Aquatic Biodiversity 7.3.1 Baseline Status of VECs The Allahabad to Farakka segment of River Ganga (LG -A) comprises a fresh water zone of 701 km. The floral and faunal diversity comprises phytoplankton, zooplankton, zoo -benthos including macro -invertebrates, fish and higher vertebrates. Phytoplankton is represented by total of 270 taxa (91 sp. of Chlorophyceae, 81 sp. of Bacillariophyceae, 7 8 sp. of Cyanophyceae, 8 sp. of Euglenophyceae, 3 sp. of Chrysophyceae, 3 sp. of Xanthophyceae, 2 sp. of Dinophyceae, 2 sp. of Rhodophyceae, 1 sp. of Cryptophyceae, 1 sp. of Synurophyceae). Zooplankton comprises of Protozoans (8 sp.), Rotifers (26 sp.) and Crustaceans (5 sp. of Copepods and 13 sp. of Cladocerans). In this stretch all groups are represented though are low in specific composition. The stretch supports the zoobenthos i.e. Insects (43%), Annelids (21%) and Molluscs (36%). Nematodes are also rep orted in the stretch. Fish in the stretch is represented by total of 121 species belonging to 35 families. Thirty five commercially important fishes are included in the taxa along with six invasive species. Beside the preponderance of fish species in this zone, an aquatic mammal, Gangetic dolphin is also present in the Bihar stretch. Fresh water turtle were also reported in Kashi turtle sanctuary area. 286 km of stretch of Lower Ganga downstream of Farakka up to Haldia Macrofauna and dominant algal species in lower Ganga is Cyanophyceae followed by Chlorophyceae. The zooplankton communities in lower Ganga basin are represented by members of Cnidaria (25 Annelida (90 taxa), Arthropoda (Total 476 taxa;240 species of Crustaceans, 33 species of Arach nids, 201 species of insects and 2 species of Merostomata), Mollusca (Total 68 taxa) and Echinodermata (17 taxa). The Ichthyo -fauna is represented by 175 species, out of Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 250 which 103 species, under 69 genera and 37 families are strictly estuarine in nature. T he higher aquatic vertebrates observed in this stretch during study period are represented by turtles and dolphins. The higher aquatic vertebrates (mammals) present in NW -1 stretch (Allahabad Otter (Lutrogale perspicillata ), vulnerable species. Among the ), mugger crocodile (Crocodylus palustris (C. por osus) and Indian Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) and variety of turtle species. Among the threatened species, Ganges Shark ( Glyphis gangeticus ), a critically endangered species is known only from the lower reaches of the Ganges -Hooghli river system, West Ben gal, India. It possibly occurs in other river systems in the area. It could also occur in shallow marine estuaries although there are no verified marine records of this species to date26. However, this species and its fingerling or yearling stages have not been recorded during the surveys under this project conducted between July to November 2015. Field observations and existing literature cites that the Ganga river system has a rich diversity of both types of planktons i.e. phyto -plankton and the Zooplankt on, though the diversity varies on account of local anthropogenic impacts from station to station. The diversity of planktons is slightly high in Hilsa Sanctuary than Kashi Turtle sanctuary and Vikramshila dolphin sanctuary area. Phytoplankton group repo rted from locations are Cyanophyceae, Xanthophyceae and Euglenophyceae members. Dominance of Bacillariophyceae members is followed by Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae was observed in studied sampling locations. H owever the diversity of the phytoplankton group is high in Hilsa sanctuary area followed by Dolphin Sanctuary and Kashi Turtle sanctuary area. Among the zooplankton group, Brachionous sp.(Rotifera) had highest percentage composition and the lowest percent age composition was of Asplanchana sp. There are several aquatic floral species present in the riparian zone and in aquatic habitat along the whole NW -1 stretch. The floral and faunal diversity comprises phytoplankton, zooplankton, zoo -benthos including macro -invertebrates, fish and higher In Ganga river from Allahabad to Haldia, NW -1 segment total of 90 taxa (28 sp. of Chlorophyceae, 39 sp. of Bacillariophyceae, 11 sp. of Cyanophyceae, 5 sp. of Euglenophyceae, 5 sp. of Rhodophyceae were obse rved. Bacillariophyceae (diatoms) dominated having maximum abundance as compared to Cholophyceae and Cyanophyceae. The Zooplankton comprises of Protozoans (11 sp.), Rotifers (10 sp.), and Crustaceans (3 sp. of Copepods and 7 sp. of Cladocerans) were obser ved during study period. Habitat for Benthos in the river is aphotic zone or benthic zone. Aphotic zone of the aquatic ecosystem is zone where sunlight is completely absent. These are depending on sediments and they take the nutrients for their survival fr om sediments. The soil samples for benthos were collected from the sediment 26 http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/9281/0 Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 251 throughout the NW -1 stretch. The most common Benthos observed in Ganga River confuses . The higher aquatic ver tebrates observed in this stretch during study period are represented by turtles and dolphins. The Ichthyo -fauna is represented by 106 species, out of which 103 species belonging to family Balilooridae, Siluridae, Cyrinidea, in NW -1 stretch (Allahabad to gangetica and turtle species. RET Species Gangetic dolphin (Schedule -1) and fresh water turtle speci es (endangered and vulnerable species) are present in the river stretch of the NW -1 primarily . Some of the vulnerable and endangered species of migratory birds also visit the IBAs located along the NW -1. EIA shall focus on species generally found in NW -1. Breeding and Spawning Fish Breeding and Spawning: Generally, fish breeding and spawning is most frequent in monsoon season (July to September). A field study was conducted during mid -June 2015 to September 2015. It was found that spawning grounds of fish es are generally located in shallow parts of river meandering sites, where water current is slow and depth is around 5 -10 cm. The genera of cat fish families like Mystus, Wallago and Clarias make a nest type breeding niche, which is looked after by male and where after a little time courtship female lays its spawn followed by the release of milt leading to fertilization. The mass of spawn/larvae collected varied from site to site and were a mixture of different species of fishes distributed in the partic ular sites and the study indicated that fishes were breeding throughout the river stretch and the larvae and the spawns were abundant near river meandering points and shallow zones. Hilsha Fish Breeding: The Bengal Hilsa ( in mari ne environment but migrates to fresh water for breeding and is anadromous in nature. It tolerates variations in salinity and travels over 1200 km in inland water for breeding upto Farakka. The Hilsa fish is heterosexual. Breeding starts with start of mons oon in July and peaks in September - December. Hilsa is primarily restricted to the estuarine zone only and its migration has been stopped in fresh water zone beyond Farakka. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 252 Dolphin Breeding (reproduction): Calving of Gangetic Dolphin generally occurs in December to January and March to May, though it can occur any time of the year. Newborn calves have been observed mainly in April and May27. Smooth -coated Otter (Lutrogale perspicillata ) is dependent on monsoons. It mostly breeds between August and Decembe r. The gestation period is 61 -65 days. Smooth -coated otters give birth to and raise their young in a burrow or shelter near water, which they excavate, or they assume an abandoned one. Two to five cubs are born in a litter, blind and helpless. At thirty days, the cub's eyes open, and by sixty days, they can swim. The cubs disperse at about 1 year of age. Sexual maturity is reached at two years Turtle Breeding: Turtle nesting season vary depending on the species. Its hatching period normally confined betw een May to October. The nesting and hatching season of fresh water turtle vary from May to October. Fish based livelihood Fishing is major occupation of the people. The monthly average income of the fisherman ranged from Rs.4000 to 7000 in Allahabad t o Patna stretch. However, in Varanasi stretch the most of the fisherman is engaging in boating and ferry services and earning more than fishing. In lower zone (Farakka to Haldia) the average income of fisherman is slightly high and ranging between 7000 to Rs. 10,000. The income is higher in lower zone (Farakka to Haldia) because of higher catch and high value fish (mainly Hilsa) in the catch. 7.3.2 Possible Impact on VECs Impact on Aquatic Ecology Impacts due to maintenance dredging are anticipated lar gely on aquatic ecology. Impacts are assessed for different scenarios as given in the following section: A. Changes in Diversity of Benthic Habitat The impacts on diversity may range from abundance of certain species of the prevailing community or even ha bitat community itself. Such changes in diversity may be caused due to change occurring in river hydrodynamics and chemical or physical characteristics of river bed sediments of the impacted area. As during dredging the settled sediments are dredged thereb y impacting the whole range of flora and fauna which dwells in the river bed sediments. Once the sediment organisms are dredged and removed along with the sediments the dredging process may even cause mortality of benthic organisms. However, recolonization of habitats after dredging at the site may initiate soon after dredging but it may take significant rehabilitation time though the benthic organisms are essential components for river health as 27Dolphin reproduction starts with the copulation of group of dolphins.Dolphin mothe rs usually go to shallow waters to deliver the calves. Usually a single calf is born, which is nursed for around 18 months with milk from the mother. Calves live close to their mothers for around 6 years. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 253 being ingredients of the aquatic food chain. Rate of rehabi litation of fresh colonies is highly variable as it is governed by characteristics of remaining sediment portions. Faster recoveries have been observed in finer sizes sediments and of less saline character. Diversity rich and stable benthic habitat is most unlikely wherever regular maintenance dredging is required (which is the case here as suspended solids get quickly settled on the bed) of the river beds in the stretches such as adjoining the terminal berths and river bed of navigation channel having lowe r LAD warranting regular maintenance dredging. However, it may be pertinent to point out that the habitat loss caused may not significantly impact the river ecological health because the maintenance dredging is confined to navigational channel of 45 m widt h in comparison to the total width of the Ganga River on such locations. Dredging activity will not have significant impact on the larger mobile faunal species such as fishes, dolphins, and turtles. The impact assessments carried out based on under water modelling of dredging noise indicated that the noise impacts on these species for their behavioural changes may not be significant. Because these organisms normally move away from the dredging spots resulting in high underwater noise generation. In any ca se mortality of these aquatic species due to dredging is not anticipated. Besides, in case minimum LAD is maintained in the channel, then it also facilitates the movement of these aquatic species as enough space is available to avoid any injury from barge movements28. B. Increased Noise Levels Noise generation due to dredging operations also disturb the aquatic life either leading to behavioural changes, tissue/gill injury, temporary loss of habitat for the dredging period or mortality (rarely) due to dred ging operations. N oise generation during dredging operations is of order of 160 -180 d(B) for CSD category of dredgers. Behavioural disturbance criteria for Dolphins & turtles from any continuous noise exposures are 177 d(B) and 150 d(B) respectively29 . In addition, no dredging operations are proposed within or in vicinity of Kashi Turtle Sanctuary and Vikramshila Dolphin Sanctuary that minimise the possibility of the impact of dredging on such vital sensitive organisms. However, in addition various mitigati on measures are still proposed to further minimize the impact of dredging on aquatic species. As per U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), sensitivity level for injury in fishes is 186 dB for fish size of >2gm and 183 dB for <2gm. Thus the dredging opera tions noise will not lead to any injury to the fishes. Also it is likely that fishes and other moving organisms will move away from the source of disturbance and since the dredging activity is short term, the aquatic fauna will move back after the disturba nce is removed. C. Increased Sediment Load/Turbidity Both dredging as well as in -stream (dumping) disposal of dredged sediments have potential to increase the sediments or turbidity load of river water due to generation of sediment plumes 28Impact Analysis on \"Ecology, Flora and Fauna inclu ding Fish and Fisheries due to Movement of Barges Carrying Coal Through National Waterway -1, Sagar to Farakka, ICAR -CIFRI 29 As per Environmental Impact Statement of South of Embley Project. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 254 during the dredg ing and disposal operations. Increased suspended sediments can affect filter feeding organisms, such as shellfish, through clogging and damaging feeding and breathing equipment (Brehmer 1965; Parr et al 1998). Similarly, young fish can be damaged if suspen ded sediments become trapped in their gills and increased fatalities of young fish which have been observed in heavily turbid water (Wilbur 1971). Adult fish are likely to move away from or avoid areas of high suspended solids, such as dredging sites, unle ss food supplies are increased as a result of increases in organic material (ABP Research R701 1997). Suspended sediment due to dredging operations in the water column blocks available light for photosynthesis, reducing benthic primary productivity and inh ibiting the ability of benthic plants to recover from dredging impacts. However, the effect of suspended sediments and turbidity in open environment like river are generally short term (<1 week after activity) and near field (<1km from activity)30. There is only need to be concern if sensitive species are located in the vicinity of the maintained channel. Since river width is wide enough compare to 45 m wide navigational channel, it is anticipated that aquatic life will get accustomed fast to regular activit y phenomenon of the river and adjust their behaviour accordingly. D. Release of Locked Pollutants in Bed Sediments Sediments settled on the bed may have trapped toxins, chemicals and pollutants which are trapped in them and are not affecting the water qu ality. The most important among the toxic pollutants are pesticides, and heavy metals. However as per analysis carried out for river bed sediments, sediments are not contaminated as covered in previous section. Therefore, any significant impacts on water quality/habitat -health of aquatic species are not anticipated. E. Disposal of Dredged Material in Aquatic Environment Disposal of dredged material may lead to burial of existing benthic community at the location of disposal and Submerged Aquatic Vegetatio n (SAV) on the river bed, leading to mortality of buried community. In case of high turbidity and disposal heap is below the photosynthetic depth (adequate light penetration) then SAV cannot recover. However as discussed above, impact of suspended sediment s and increased turbidity is of temporary being confined to disposal location besides of short term in nature. F. Increased Depth During Dredging In shallow waters, the light necessary for photosynthesis penetrates to the bottom of the water column. The L AD proposed is 3 m so the availability of sun light at bottom for clean river water will supports the growth of SAV and algae. SAV at the bottom provides shelter and food for young fish and helps reduce turbidity by resisting water flow and thus, allow sediment generated during dumping to settle out. The benthic algae are an important component of food chain and serve as a food source for some fish species. When the water 30.As per UK Marine SACs Projects assessments Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 255 gets too deep (below 6 feet/1.8 m) the available sun light decreases and plants growth is restricted as it can no longer photosynthesize in the deep channel area. Impacts on Avifauna Dredging and dredge Sediment disposal activities may also have certain impact on the avifauna having its habitats identified as Important Bird Area (IBA) loca ted close to or along shallow waters areas of the river (Refers Chapter for IBA locations). However, the dredging impact will be localized and will be confined within the impact zone (may be of 500 m or less) and duration of dredging only. Avifauna is dis turbed during dredging periods due to high noise levels, reduction in availability of aquatic food such a fishes in dredging stretches and increase in various human activity at dredging sites. Noise level of the order 80 dB(A) is expected to be generated f rom dredging operations. Apart from dredging effect, disposal of dredged material in mud flats and reed land which are habitat of the migratory and other water birds, may also impact the aquatic birds. The most impacts will be confined to initial period on ly as on later stage avifauna will gets acclimatized to the situation. Impact Due to Vessel Speed and Movement on Aquatic Organisms Aquatic mammals are subjected to threat of collision by vessel speeds causing injury and death. Dolphins, fishes moving in river can collide with the moving vessels which may cause them injury and even mortality. To minimise the chances of collision, restricted vessel speed of 2.7 knots (5 kmph) is proposed within VSGDS and in Kashi turtle sanctuary. Even in low speed danger still exists for juveniles of dolphins and other fishes which can get trapped / entangled with propellers blades leading to injury or death. Propeller guards in ships could reduce mortality. Impact Due to Ballast Water Discharges on Aquatic Organisms Ballast water discharges by vessel can have a negative impact on the aquatic environment . Bulk cargo carriers use a huge amount of ballast water, which is often taken in from the coastal waters from one region and may be discharged at the next location. Such Ballast water typically contains a variety of biological materials, including plants , animals , viruses , and bacteria from the sea water intake location. As ballast wat er may have various non -native, nuisance, invasive, exotic species that can cause ecological imbalance and economic damage to the receiving aquatic ecosystems besides certain human health problems. Since NW1 is an inland waterway transport project with mov ement of vessel only within same aquatic river environment no impacts due to ballast water discharges are anticipated. Though coastal vessel arrive at Haldia Terminal but loaded with coal and thus will not be require d to discharge any ballast water. There fore, no impact due to ballast water discharge is anticipated Impact Due to Spillage of Oil/Material in River on Aquatic Organisms Materials like coal, oil, building construction material, textiles, fertilizers etc. are proposed to be transported through the waterway. In case of accidents these materials can spill in the River and may pollute the water quality and may have significant impact on aquatic ecology. Oil spills are well known to cause significant harmful impacts on sea aquatic ecology as the oil Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 256 leaks form a thin film floating over the sea water and thereby breaking contact between seawater & air (DO reaeration). This floating oil enters the gills of fishes and other organism and block the gills, skin pores and may impact the normal functioning o f the aquatic organisms. Impact of oil spills on various aquatic organisms is summarised below: Plankton: Oil spills can lead to plankton kills. The recovery of plankton will be however quicker through repopulation of the community by fresh planktons from adjacent areas not affected by oil. Eggs and larvae of fishes, crustaceans and molluscs which are highly sensitive to even low concentrations of PHc (10 -100 g/l) and aromatics (1 - 5 g/l) in particular will be severely affected. However, it is unlikely that any localised losses of fish eggs and larvae caused by a spill will have discernible effect on the size or health of future adult populations. Benthos: These organisms have limited movements and hence, are more vulnerable to oil spills. If the thick w eathered oily mass spread on intertidal areas, immediate mortalities of organisms in the zones of physical contact are expected. Sub-tidal benthos of shallow waters might also be killed or tainted if the sinking residue affects their habitats. If the resid ue persists for longer time in the sub -tidal or intertidal segments due to poor circulation, the recovery will be delayed. Thus, the benthic organisms near to the berth area will recover slower than the organism away from berth area due to poor water circu lation near the berthing area. Fishes: A large oil spill can temporarily reduce the fish catch from the area as fish might migrate from the affected zone. Limited mortality may also occur particularly when the oil concentrations in water go abnormally high . Fishes are sensitive to oil and tend to avoid petroleum. Often fishes get tainted and unpalatable but become normal when the ambient PHC level approaches the baseline which is expected within a few days. The area which is the breeding and nursery grounds for a variety of fish and shell fish, large scale mortality of eggs and larval stages of several economically important groups may occur if oil is transported to these habitats during major accidental oil spill. Local fishermen may get affected by getting either contaminated fishes/crabs/larvae etc. or poor catch. Impact Due to High Noise Generation During Movement on Aquatic Organisms Cargo vessels generate substantial broadband underwater noise from their propellers, motors, auxiliary machinery, gear bo xes and shafts, plus their hull wake and turbulence. Diesel motors produce more noise than steam or gas turbines, but most long distance (low frequency) noise is generated by the hissing cavitation of spinning propellers. Noise generation from the ship m ovement is continuous type of noise generation. Noise generation from ship movement (1500 -2000 DWT) vary from 110 -140 d(B). This order of noise generation may have impact on behaviour of various aquatic organisms and may lead to other injuries like tissue injury, temporary & permanent hearing loss. However physical impact on aquatic species is not anticipated as the aquatic species moves away from the source of disturbance (barge) and usually do not come close. But impacts of this level of noise can be on behavioural responses and audiometry of aquatic species, turtles and dolphins in particular. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 257 A. Impacts on Behavioural Response of Aquatic Organisms and on Auditory System of Dolphins Due to Noise Generation from Moving Barges This assessment has been carri ed out considering the outputs of various studies vs noise and using mathematical techniques (underground noise modelling) to assess the expected noise from vessel movement in IWT in NW -1. Based on above studies it is established that bulk vessels moving a t a speed of 2.7 knots (5 kmph) generates noise of range 130 -140 d(B). However, considering the variation upper limit of 160 d9B) is also considered underwater noise modelling assessment. Output of Underwater Noise Modelling: An estimation is carried ou t to assess distance of achieving the safe threshold noise level of 150 d(B) for turtle and 177 d(B) Dolphin from behavioural consideration perspective as per EIA Study of \"South of Embley Project\" sited above. It is concluded that noise level of 150 d(B ) can be achieved at distance less than 4.6 m from centre of the ship for turtle. However, the maximum beam of ship which will ply in waterway is 11.4 m. Thus possibility of occurrence of organism at 4.6 m is comparatively less . B. Impact on Auditory System of Dolphins Due to Noise Generation from Moving Barges When the dolphin s auditory system is exposed to a high level of sound for a specific duration, the sensory hair cells begin to fatigue and do not immediately return to their normal shape (NRC 2005)31. This causes a reduction in the hearing sensitivity, or an increase in hearing threshold. If the noise exposure is below some critical sound energy level, the hair cells will eventually return to their normal shape. This effect is called a temporary thre shold shift (TTS) as the hearing loss is temporary. If the noise exposure exceeds the critical sound energy level, the hair cells become permanently damaged and the effect is called permanent threshold shift (PTS). C. Impact Due to Masking of Biological Impo rtant Noise of Aquatic organism by Noise Generated from Moving Barges Another impact of high noise level generated from moving barges is masking of biologically important sounds. These sounds may interfere with communication and social interaction and cause changes in behaviour as well. The zone of masking impact will be highly variable and depends on many factors including the distance between the listener and sources of the signal and masking noise, the level of the signal and masking noise, and the prop agation of noise from the signal and masking source to the listener. It is however important to note that masking of communication and echolocation signals naturally occurs by the ambient noise environment. Man -made noise causes additional masking of a sig nal only when it is of a higher 31 NRC. (2005). Marine Mammal Populations and Ocean Noise - Determining When Noise Causes Biologically Significant Effects. National Research Council, National Academies Press Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 258 level than the ambient environment within the species critical hearing bandwidth at the signals dominant frequencies. Echolocation clicks produced by the Ganges River Dolphin have dominant energy around 65 kHz (Sugimatsu e t al., 2011)32. This is well above the dominant frequency range of most man -made noise, including pump noise. Masking of echolocation signals is therefore not a significant issue for most man -made sources (Richardson et al., 1995). Thus it can be concluded that noise generation due to barge movement is not anticipated to interfere with echolocation ability of Ganges Dolphins . The Ganges River Dolphin is likely to produce communication signals, such as whistles, squeals or clicks, based on communication signa ls produced by other river dolphins. These signals generally have energy at much lower frequencies than the echolocation clicks, i.e. as low as 1 -6 kHz. Communication signals are therefore more likely to be masked by man -made noise than echolocation clicks . Noise reduction measures will help in minimizing the noise generation from barge movement and will minimize masking of communication signals generated by dolphins. Impacts Due to Physical Interventions on Aquatic Ecology Pre-Construction/Design and Con struction Stage Eco-sensitive aquatic habitats identified within NW -1 are Vikramshila Dolphin sanctuary (Sultanpur -Kahalgaon) and Kashi Turtle Sanctuary at Varanasi. No civil intervention is proposed within these locations. Also it is proposed no dredging/ dredge disposal will be carried out within this stretch. Thus impacts anticipated on these eco -sensitive zones during design & construction phase are minimal. However, construction activities like dredging/piling is proposed to be carried out in river stre tch along the planned terminal/jetties site. Piling & dredging activities have potential to impact aquatic ecology of the area. Anticipated impacts during construction phase on aquatic ecology for the project are given below: Impact of Piling/Dredging Act ivity due to sound Generation on Aquatic ecology: Piling & dredging activities will be carried out for construction of proposed off -site facilities like jetties & berths. For the purpose, dredger will be placed in the River which will occupy some physical space in the River. This space was being used by the biotic components of the river. As a behavioural response, instinctively animals at the first encounter avoid approaching the site of unknown object. This is done using echolocation, olfaction or chemo -reception, if the object is not making any sound. If object / machine starts making sound / noise, then all vertebrates through auditory acoustic sense avoid the area which has disturbing range of sound and hampers to the natural acoustic behaviour and phys iology of these vertebrate fauna from fishes to dolphins. 32 Sugimatsu et al. (2011 ). Annual Behavioral Changes of the Ganges River Dolphins (Platanista gangetica) Based on the Three Long -Term Monitoring Seasons using 6 -Hydrophone Array System. IEEE Symposium on and 2011 Workshop on Scientific Use of Submarine Cables and Related Technolo gies, (pp. 1 -7). Tokyo Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 259 Apart from occupying the physical space, dredging and pilling activity will generate significant noise. Exposure to low levels of sound for a relatively long period of time, or exposure to higher levels of sound for shorter periods of time, may result in auditory tissue damage in fish, though recovery is generally possible within 24 hrs (Popper et al. 2005). Oscillations induced by high sound pressure levels can cause swim bladders in fishes to te ar or rupture (Hastings and Popper 2005). Whereas it is possible that some (although not all) species of fish would swim away from a sound source, thereby decreasing exposure to sound, larvae and eggs of fish are often at the mercy of currents or move very slowly. Movement of the fishes and dolphins away from these places makes the place unused for foraging, spawning and local movement. This would cause crowding of organisms at other places and enhanced struggle for space and other requirements, till the di sturbance has not ceased/completed. Impact of Piling/Dredging Activity: loss of habitat Large amount of river bed sediment (dredged Material) will be removed for carrying out bank & bed scouring and erosion protection. Bed and bank erosion/scour preventi on works involve stone pitching of banks upstream & downstream, concreting of banks, construction of retaining walls/embankments along the river banks, construction of aprons across the river along the length of the proposed terminal/jetty, construction of guide walls in case of Farakka lock etc. These sediments are in habituated by various benthos (molluscs, arthropods, juvenile fishes, amphibians and reptiles etc.). Removal of these sediments will lead to mortality of these communities. Also the actual ha bitat will be lost permanently in the activity area due to bed and bank erosion/scour prevention works. Impact on the moving aquatic species is however anticipated to be low as they disperse when any activity is being carried out in the river. The major impact on larger organism is that the movement routes, spawning activities and foraging grounds of these organisms may be affected. These animals would also struggle for normal conditions due to increased turbidity and increased sedimentation during the d redging activity. Increased sediments and turbidity can impact the aquatic life by reducing visibility, making water coarse, choking gills of fishes etc. Thus measures should be taken to quicken up the dredging and piling activities, minimizing the noise l evel and controlling the sediments generation. Among the floral components rooted plants will be uprooted and destroyed totally. The primary productivity by phytoplankton will be lowered, on account of lowered transparency for light. Impact of Piling, dre dging and other construction activities due to release of sediments The riparian area soil are loose and sticky/clayey. Release of these sediments would cause high increase in turbidity of water during and sometime after the dredging/oiling activity. Such soil has a tendency of sticking over the skin and gills and blocking the pores and is hence harmful. Suspended sediment due to dredging operations in the water column blocks available light for photosynthesis, reducing benthic primary productivity and inhi biting the ability of benthic plants to recover from dredging impacts. But the effect of suspended sediments and turbidity in open environment like river are generally short term (<1 week after activity) and near field Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 260 (<1km from activity). There is only n eed to be concern if sensitive species are located in the vicinity of the maintained channel. Some pollutants such as insecticides, pesticides, fertilizers may be unlocked from sediments when dredged. But soon it will be washed away along the flow. The te st results show very low concentration of pesticide. Even then there are chances that it may enter the food chain. Construction activities to be undertaken involves storage of raw material, debris, fuel, paints etc. There are likely chances that, the run -off from the site may get contaminated with these materials and when it will enter the water body may also degrade the water quality of the river. Operation Stage Impact due to operation of any project is of main concern as it always persists. Construct ion of berths, jetties and other off -shore structure will consume physical space in water reducing the available space for the aquatic organism. Planktonic population at berth area and nearby area will reduce or will decrease drastically which will impact the primary productivity of the water body. Planktons is feed for various big fishes, thus reduce in plankton population will affect the aquatic food chain. However, area to be covered by berth is very less as compared to width of the river. Thus reduction of this much space will not have significant impact. Also it is possible that aquatic organisms may collide with these newly constructed structures. But as behavioural response, instinctively aquatic animals at the first encounter avoid approaching the si te of unknown object. This is done using echolocation, olfaction or chemo -reception, if the object is not making any sound. Thus the space occupied by unknown structures will be avoided by aquatic organisms thereby reducing the chances of collisions and in jury to aquatic organisms. During rains, run -off from the stockyards at jetty/terminal sites may enter the river and may contain the contaminants. This contaminated run -off may pollute river water quality, if discharged in river. Thus proper storm water c ollection and management system is required so as water from stockyards do not enter the river directly. Sewage & waste will be generated at intervention sites (terminal/jetties/locks) and in vessel. If this waste is disposed on the land or in river, then this waste can pollute the soil impacting the terrestrial ecology and can pollute the water impacting aquatic ecology. Release of coal dust during coal transhipment and may settle on surface of the river and will have a negative impact aquatic life. Othe r activities at the sites of civil interventions which may have impact on aquatic ecology are berthing & mooring of vessel, oil/material spillage, dust generation from material transportation, barge movement and maintenance dredging for keeping the berth a rea navigable. Berthing & mooring of the vessel at terminal/jetties reduces the circulation of water in the area thereby reducing the air flow in the water and self -assimilative capacity of river in that stretch. If vessel is berthed for longer duration at terminal/jetty sites, then there are increased chances of release of toxins from anti -fouling coating of vessel or leakage of some oil Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 261 from bilge tank into the river. All these may pollute the river water quality near the terminal/jetty sites. Movement of barges in the civil intervention area will increase after development of the proposed interventions and thus the transportation of commodities will also increase. Some of the commodities to be transported include building & construction material, and coal which may generate the dust and this dust can settle over the surface of the river. This dust will increase turbidity of water and may reduce the visibility of the water there by impacting the SAV, planktonic communities and other aquatic fauna. This dust if consumed by aquatic organisms may cause respiratory and other related problems in organisms. Thus it is required for transportation of dust generating material under covered conditions. Also coal should be kept moist so as to reduce the dust generation potential during transportation. It is proposed to transport edible oil/POL at Haldia terminal site so there are likely chances of accidental oil spillage near the terminal site or in the waterway. Oil spillages are threat to aquatic organisms and can lea d to mass mortality also. Oil spills can affect all planktons, benthos and Fishes. Maintenance dredging and disposal of dredged material will also be required to be undertaken at the proposed intervention sites so as make them navigable throughout the yea r. As per the planning, insignificant quantity of dredging will require to be carried out at Sahibganj & Varanasi terminal site. Dolphins are found in the river stretch along Sahibganj terminal. Terminal site is located in the secondary channel so impact o f dredging near terminal site on the dolphins is nil. Dredging of 30 -60 lakh cum will be required at Haldia Terminal site but no dolphins are observed in that stretch of river. Quantity of dredging will depend on the duration for which terminal will be k ept navigable and nos. of berths to be kept navigable. Dredging operations generate high noise levels, increased turbidity of the water, and removal of benthic community thus impacting aquatic ecology, reduce DO level in water thus reducing available oxyge n for aquatic organisms, may unlock toxins trapped in the sediments etc. All these impact the aquatic environment and organisms From the above discussion, it is evident that physical interventions development can affect both the terrestrial and aquatic ec ology however barge operations and maintenance dredging operations will majorly affect the aquatic ecology. Significance of the impacts of physical interventions will be different in different phases on both the component however the impact on aquatic ecol ogy due to dredging and barge operations is anticipated majorly during operation phase. The impacts are significant and can be severe. Mitigation measures as proposed are essentially required to be implemented to prevent the impact on the terrestrial and a quatic ecology. 7.3.3 Strategic Recommendations Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 262 Based on the inventorying and mapping of VECs, exclusion (No Go areas) and restricted areas have been identified and given in \" Basin level Critical Environment Resources study for Project Capacity Augment ation of National Waterway -1\" which is summarized below. Exclusion (No Go) areas in Ganga Basin and NW -1 (With respect to Wildlife protected Areas) Exclusion (No Go areas) has been defined with respect to location of proposed project interventions of IW AI location of critical environment resources in Ganga Basin and along main stem of Ganga in NW -1. No-Go Areas - Ganga Main Stem Other than NW -1 stretch Upper Ganga River (Brijghat to Narora Stretch) is declared as a Ramsar Site. Moreover, Ganges Dolphin C onservation Zone Garhmukteshwar - Narora Barrage has been recommended to be declared as \"No Go area\" for which detailed studies have been done by WWF - India. Given the recognition of Upper Ganga River as a Ramsar site and in line with finding of previous s tudies and recommendations, this stretch is further recommended to be Exclusion (No go area). Since, this river stretch is outside the purview of NW -1, it would not be directly impacted by plying of IWAIs vessels. However, hydrological interventions for augmenting flow in the NW -1 should avoid this area for planning any hydrological interventions. No-Go Areas - NW-1 stretch Two notified wildlife sanctuaries are located within the main stem of river Ganga in NW -1 namely: 1. Turtle WLS, Varanasi 2. Vikaramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, Bhagalpur The entire notified stretches of river are considered as No Go area. The Turtle Wildlife Sanctuary stretch (the 7 Km long river stretch) at Varanasi the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary stretch located in Bihar State (starting from Sultanganj to Kahalgaon pahad, about 50 km stretch, is recommended to be exclusion (No Go area) in NW -1 from the point of IWAIs interventions. Restricted Areas The restricted areas are identified as per the criteria defined. As p er this criteria the buffer zone of two sanctuaries located in NW -1 (the No Go areas) and one sanctuary located about 9 Km away from NW -1 is identified as restricted areas. Determination of Areas Having Minimum Impacts Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 263 Areas other than those marked as ex clusion (No Go area) and restricted areas are of least environmental sensitivity and environmental impacts. IWAIs vessels, cargo and tourist vessels plying in NW -1 through restricted and critical stretches as identified above should take adequate environ ment and social safeguards as described below. 1. Maintaining water depth of the navigation channel (at least 6 m)33. This measure may reduce the disturbance to the migrating Hilsa, benthic habitat, facilitate escapement of fishes and aquatic mammals from di rect impact of the barge/vessels, considering that the fully loaded barge draft is 2.7 m. This will also help Hilsa, which prefers more than 5 m depth for their migration. 2. The spawning & breeding grounds are not identified in the entire NW -1 stretches. Spawning areas normally have enough sand depth and water depth in general. Normally the spawning activity occurs in the rainy season. All care shall be given during construction & dredging activities to avoid any damage to spawning, breeding and nesting habi tat of threatened aquatic species like Dolphin, Smooth Coated Otter, Gangetic Shark, Mugger, Gharial, Turtle, Hilsa, etc during spawning season which is from May to August. 3. Measures would also be required from aquatic perspective in terms of vessel mov ement speed, material handling (like coal dust spillages to river, oil spillages to river) and other operational aspects may have impact on aquatic life. Necessary design features to be included based on intervention specific environmental impact assessmen t and capital dredging impact assessment as well as mitigation measures proposed. 7.3.4 Responsibility for implementation IWAI, PMU and Contractors will have direct responsibility in effective implementation and internal monitoring of environment manage ment plan and mitigation measures. Compliance to conditions as set out by various regulatory authorities will be monitored by concerned regulatory authorities. Vessel owners, cargo operators, dredge operators, tourist operators and other users of NW -1 shall comply with conditions set out in EMP and implement mitigation measures. 7.4 Landuse & Soil Quality 7.4.1 Baseline Status 33 Impact Analysis on \"Ecology, Flora and Fauna including Fish and Fisheries due to Movement of Barges Carrying Coal through National Waterway No.1 (Sagar to Farakka) Final Report ICAR - Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) Barrackpore, West Bengal Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 264 At basin level, NW 1 passes through the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal which are extensively c ultivated, constituting about 10 % of the total area of the India. About 11 % of total land of NW -1 states are fallow land and 52% percent as net sown area. The cropping intensity is highest in west Bengal with 184.1 % followed by Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The land use classes in 10 km area of the NW -1 are agricultural land, settlement, water body, forest, barren land and vegetation. It is majorly dominated by agricultural land. About 78.9 % of the land is under cultivation, 7.18% land is under settlement, 7.21% of the land is under water bodies, 3.59 % land is under vegetation, 2.82% land is under dry river bed and rest of the land falls under other uses. Soil along NW -1 can be described as Sandy Clay and Clay Loam type. Overall soil type / quality along the NW -1 area is of moderately fertile and not expected to be detrimental to the growth of agricultural and forest crops and forms the basis of agriculture resources / cropping pattern. The Ganga River with its fertile soil is having a great i nfluence to the agriculture based economies of adjoining district along the NW -1. The major crops cultivated in that area include rice, lentils, sugarcane, potatoes, oil seeds and wheat. Along the banks of the river, the existence of swamps and lakes also provide a rich fertile soil for crops like legumes, chillies, sesame, mustard, sugarcane, and jute. The major habitation located along NW is the main source of the livelihood generation for the people residing along the NW-1 area. Many towns in the area are primarily industrial. Commercial fisheries in the Ganga River System are an important source of livelihood for the people residing along the Ganga River. Pilgrimage and the associated tourism brings along a major source of revenue for religious towns and their people. In cities and town along NW -1 area, the main and marginal workers34 are 14% and 2% respectively while the remaining 57% of total population constitutes non -workers. The main occupation is agriculture, farm labor, factory workers and workers in trade related activiti es. A number of programs both at central & state government level are being implemented particularly for agriculture improvement/ farm productivity/ cropping intensity, soil quality and irrigation improvement & coverage. Further, urbanization is being regu lated by master plans and building bye laws. Urban sanitation services are being covered under AMRUT, Clean India Mission and NMCG programs of Government of India. 7.4.2 Possible Impact on VECs 34A person who has worked for more than 183 days in a year is called the main worker. Marginal workers are those who have worked any time in the year preceding the census but have not worke d for major part, which is not more than 183 days, of the year Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 265 NW 1 is going to improve the accessibility and transportat ion in a climate friendly way (lesser GHG emissions) of agriculture produce as well as other items like finished products like automobiles, steel, coal, cement etc. Therefore, direct, indirect & induced impacts are being anticipated in the ten km area dur ing implementation of phase 1. Assessment of land resources indicates land use change particularly diversion of agriculture land for urbanization, industries & infrastructure development. This also indicates loss of top soil as well its quality considering requirement for infrastructure development as well as serving as a sink for discharges. Though urbanization is an ongoing phenomenon with an average increase in urban population around 1% annually, any new or associated infrastructure development like NW 1 and intervention is expected to accelerate it. Population concentration around hotspots along NW 1is going have additional stress on the land as well as civic amenities water supply, solid waste management, sewage and other utilities. Further, soil erosi on, which is already an ongoing phenomena in the basin as well as in the influence area, NW1infrastrucure on the banks may further accelerate it at the point of intervention. Earlier data indicates that there is substantial decline in major carps fish ca tch in Allahabad to Farakka stretch over past few years. 7.4.3 Strategic Recommendations 1. Land use change needs to be monitored in the short and the long term considering rapid urbanization in the influence area. Stress/ pressure and carrying capacity o f the hotspots needs to be assessed in future for better local area and zonal planning. 2. Agriculture productivity and soil quality need to be monitored by agriculture department in the influence area. 3. Any future development/ intervention in NW needs to be well planned & designed, implemented and monitored from environmental perspective considering zero waste discharge approach, green buildings, access roads and railway infrastructure. These development/ interventions need to be follow the statutory require ments like EIA/EMP but also designed on the principles of 3Rs (reduce, recover & recycle) and adaptation for climate change. 4. There is a need to monitor the economic activity particularly fishing activity and the sector in the entire NW 1 stretch to avoid its disruption. 7.4.4 Responsibility for implementation 1. Recommendation 1 needs to be carried out by state level town planning, urban development industrial infrastructure development department & environment department. Part of recommendation 2 especial ly for agriculture productivity and soil quality need to be monitored by state agriculture department. Part of recommendation 3 especially for road and railway infrastructure should be implemented by state road department/ PWD and Indian railways/ DFCCIL. 2. Recommendation 3 and recommendation 4 related to NW 1 infrastructure development should be carried out by IWAI. This not only includes EIA/EMP Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 266 preparation and implementation from perspective of environmental planning but also based on alternative/ option a nalysis related to location but also on the principles of 3Rs (reduce, recover and recycle) and climate change. Economic activity and livelihoods directly related to NW1 need to be monitored by IWAI. This monitoring can be institutionalized by integrating environmental and social indicators as part of their information system. 7.5 Air 7.5.1 Baseline Status of VECs The air is generally dry in the region except during monsoon. March and April are the driest months with relative humidity ranging between 25-84%. The wind speed in the area was mostly between 1.9 km/hour at Patna IMD and maximum of 8.7 km/hour at Kolkata IMD for all the months of a year. The predominant wind direction is from North and Northwest direction in winters and South and Southeast direction during rest of the season. December and January constitutes winter months with daily mean minimum temperature of around 9.1 \u00ba C at Patna (IMD Station) and daily mean maximum temperature of around 26.9\u00ba C at Kolkata. April and May are the hottest months with daily mean maximum temperature varying around 40.4\u00ba C at Varanasi and daily mean minimum temperature around 24 \u00ba C at Malda. The air environment in the influence area is critical especially at the hotspots. This is due to traffic and industrial areas in and around the hotspots. PM 10 values in all locations are within the specified limit of 100 g/m3 as per NAAQS except at Varanasi, Patna and Howrah. High values with respect to PM 2.5 were recorded in Varanasi, Patna and Howrah locations. The high est levels of SO 2 were found at Varanasi, Howrah and Patna location that may be due to heavy vehicular movement and industrial activities in these locations. High NOx was observed in those locations that lie in city area like Varanasi, Patna, Howrah and Ha ldia. Carbon Mono -oxides i.e. Howrah, Patna and Varanasi. 7.5.2 Possible Impact on VECs Data analysis at the hotspots and other urban centers in the influence areas indicate increasing air pollution both at temporal and geographical scale due to increased urbanization, traffic, construction and industrial activities. Therefore, air pollution footprint is gradually increasing around hotspots. This is also contributing to greater GHG emissions and climate chan ge. Activities in and around NW 1 terminals catalyzing urbanization and also including connectivity to major national/ state highways and railways will add incremental air pollution load both during construction and operation of the project. Further, vesse l movement along NW1 will also add to air pollution along the stretch. 7.5.3 Strategic Recommendations Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 267 1. Zonal planning and master planning of urban centers (hotspots) need to be upgraded in view of expected urbanization. These plans need to include devel opments related to NW 1 e.g. best locations for terminals, access, connectivity (roads & railways) and related infrastructure. 2. NW 1 operational strategy should aim for zero emissions. This should include alternate fuel e.g. CNG or renewable energy e.g. sol ar powered based barge/ vessel operations. 3. GHG accounting should be carried out especially for terminal and operation related movement of NW 1.This should also include GHG avoided & added vis a vis rail and road transport. 4. Air pollution monitoring infrastr ucture should be augmented in and around hotspots by state pollution control board. 7.5.4 Responsibility for implementation 1. Recommendations 1 & 2 needs to be carried out by state level town planning, urban development industrial infrastructure developme nt department & environment department. Part of recommendation 1 especially for road and railway infrastructure should be implemented by state road department/ PWD and Indian railways/ DFCCIL. This not only includes EIA/EMP preparation and implementation f rom perspective of environmental planning but also based on alternative/ option analysis related to location but also on the principles of 3Rs (reduce, recover and recycle) and climate change. 2. Recommendation 2 and 3 related to GHG accounting for NW 1 inf rastructure development and operations should be carried out by IWAI. 3. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) monitor pollution related data for major urban and industrial centers. However, all the hotspots need to be covered under their monitoring programs. There is a need to augment capacity and capability of these agencies. Further, IWAI can compliment this effort by monitoring air quality both upstream and downstream of their terminal locations as well in critic al hotspots. This monitoring can be institutionalized by integrating environmental and social indicators as part of their information system. 7.6 Noise 7.6.1 Baseline Status of VECs Ambient noise levels show variation on account of anthropogenic activ ities in the influence area particularly near the urban centres. There are 81 Ghats along with few temples within the limit of Kashi turtle Sanctuary area. There is a large gathering of people in Ghat area in most of the time. Loud speakers in nearby relig ious shrines is the another source of noise in the sanctuary area. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 268 7.6.2 Possible Impact on VECs Ambient noise levels are expected to rise above baseline on account of increased anthropogenic activities in the influence area particularly near the urban c entres. Along NW 1 noise levels are expected to rise due to maintenance dredging, barge operations and activities around terminal sites. Dredging operations generates noise levels of app. 85 -90 dB(A). This noise level adds to the aerial noise levels of the area thereby exceeding the baseline noise levels. High noise level has serious impacts on human health and the flora & fauna residing in the area. But the noise significantly reduces and dissipates with distance. Dredging will be carried out within the ri ver thus the noise levels due to dredging operation will reduce by the time it reaches the habitation area. Through noise modelling study, it is seen that noise levels reduce to 56 dB(A) at distance of 500 m from source which is equivalent to baseline nois e levels of the area. Also dredging is carried out intermittently thus impact will not be continuous type. Thus impact due to dredging operations on noise environment is low and can be further managed by adoption of recommendations. Barge movement does not involves significant aerial noise generation, however significant underwater noise is generated. The ambient noise level generation dissipates with the noise of the currents. Source of noise pollution in NW 1 during the design and construction phase at t he proposed intervention sites are site clearing, operation of excavators/earth moving equipment and leveller, operation of heavy machinery and equipment for construction purpose, loading & unloading of construction material and piling & dredging activitie s. Operation of abovementioned equipments will generate high noise and will lead to increase in ambient noise level at the site and nearby areas and may impact the health of construction labour and nearby residents. Impact on nearby residents due to the noise generated is low in case of all presently planned site as habitations are located at more than 100 m at all the presently planned sites. Apart from above activities piling and dredging activities are to be carried out in river for construction of ber ths. These activities also generate significant level of noise ranging from 85 -90 dB(A). However, this will also be confined to the piling and dredging period. No piling and dredging activity shall be carried out at night time. Noise generation sources d uring operation phase are primarily loading and unloading of material at site and cargo vessel, movement of dumpers, cargo vessel, operation of backup power generators, pumps and other equipment. However, the main effect on the environmental noise level wi ll be from increased transportation of goods entering and leaving the terminal site. Land use of the site is industrial and permissible noise levels at present are well within the CPCB standards that is 70 dB(A) for night time and 75 dB(A) for day time. During operation stage these levels are expected to increase due to above mentioned activities.Impact due to underwater noise generation, including dredging and barge operations on aquatic ecology is given in the section on VEC related to aquatic biodiversit y. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 269 7.6.3 Strategic Recommendations 1. Zonal planning and master planning of urban centers (hotspots) need to be upgraded in view of expected urbanization. These plans need to include developments related to NW 1 e.g. best locations for terminals, access, co nnectivity (roads & railways) and related infrastructure as well as sensitive receptors. 2. NW 1 operational strategy should aim for activities with reduced noise generation. Recommendations to address impacts due to Maintenance Dredging for maintaining minimum LAD in navigation channel . Dredgers should be regularly serviced and maintained so as to prevent noise due to friction Workers should be provided with ear plugs to prevent exposure to high noise levels A survey on sensitive nosie receptors should be carried out for area within 500 m of dredging operations Provision of noise barrier in the impacted area if any sensitive receptor is located within 500 m distance No dredging activity should be carried out beyond 10:00 PM and before 6:00 Am Formulation o f noise limit standards by concerned authorities for dredgers also similar to other construction machineries and vehicles By provision of earplugs to the workers engaged in high noise generating activities, impact due to noise pollution can be managed. As per occupation standards, workers exposure to 90 dB(A) noise level shall not be more than 8 hours. OSHA guidelines shall be followed for exposure to specific noise levels for workers . Conducting hearing tests for workers also help in monitoring the impac t of the higher noise level on workers health. Provision shall be made for: Barricading (Temporary noise barrier) the construction site to minimize the noise level outside the site boundary Restriction on Honking at the project site Hearing test for the workers prior to deployment at site and high noise areas followed by periodic testing every six months. Job rotations systems for workers, working in high noise level areas Restriction of high noise generating activity between 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM. Period ic monitoring (monthly level) of noise levels to check the level of pollutants and effectiveness of proposed EMP Protection devices (earplugs or earmuffs) shall be provided to the workers operating near high noise generating machines. Construction equipmen t and Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 270 machinery shall be fitted with silencers and maintained properly. Noise measurements should be carried out to ensure the effectiveness of mitigation measures and develop a mechanism to record and respond to complaints on noise. All equipment shall b e fitted with silencers/noise mufflers and will be properly maintained to minimize its operational noise. Noise level will be one of the considerations in equipment selection, which will favour lower sound power levels. Operation stage Site boundary shoul d be provided which can act as noise barrier Earplugs should be provided to workers involved in unloading operations Provision of thick green belt along the boundary and roads which will act as noise buffer Timely maintenance and servicing of transportatio n vehicles and the machinery/pumps to be used during operation phase to reduce the noise generation due to friction and abrasion Honking shall be prohibited at the project site Hearing test for the workers shall be undertaken before employing them and thereafter shall be done after every six months Job rotations should be practised for people, working in high noise level areas Noise generating activity should be restricted between 6:00 am to 10:00 pm. DG sets shall be provided with acoustic enclosure Monit oring of Noise levels shall be carried out on monthly basis to check the level of pollutants and effectiveness of proposed EMP Strategic recommendations to address underwater noise generation, including dredging and barge operations on aquatic ecology is given in VEC related to aquatic biodiversity. 7.6.4 Responsibility for implementation Recommendations 1 needs to be carried out by state level town planning, urban development industrial infrastructure development department & environment department. Pa rt of recommendation 1 especially for road and railway infrastructure should be implemented by state road department/ PWD and Indian railways/ DFCCIL. This not only includes EIA/EMP preparation and implementation from perspective of environmental planning. IWAI, PMU and Contractors will have direct responsibility in effective implementation and internal monitoring of environment management plan and mitigation measures. Compliance to conditions as set out by various regulatory authorities will be monitored by concerned regulatory authorities. NHAI, PWD, DFFCIL, Indian Railways, vessel owners, cargo operators, dredge operators, tourist operators and other developers of infrastructure and users of NW -1 shall comply with conditions set out in EMP and implement mitigation measures . Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 271 7.7 Socio -economic Infrastructure Services & Facilities 7.7.1 Baseline Status of VECs There are many cities, towns and villages located along the NW -1. As per the Census Record of India 2011, the population of major cities/ town located along the Ganga River in NW - 1 section was recorded as 12875343 comprising 6782150 male and 6093193 females. About 75.4% of the population is literate and 23.6% is illiterate in cities/town located along the NW -1 is illiterate. Male population is more literate than female. The cities and towns along NW -1 have most of required infrastructure facilities. Infrastructural facilities namely Industries/industrial areas, transmission line, national highways, other roads, railways, settlement, cultural sites and archaeological sites. All the towns and cities along the NW -1 are well connected with national highways, state highways, district roads, railways. Cities like Varanasi, Patna, and Kolkata are also connected with airways. Some of cities located al ong the NW -1 are connected with localised ferry services as well. Eleven thermal power plants are located in close proximity of river Ganga between Haldia and Allahabad and 10 more are reportedly are proposed to be set up in close proximity of the river. These terminal power plants have boosted the prospect of the waterway like never before for transportation of imported coal to these power stations. Transportation of coal to NTPC power plant at Farakka is already operational through NW - 1. There are 30 c lass I cities and 8 class II towns along the mainstream of river Ganga at NW-1 segment. These cities are discharging 2173.8 MLD wastewater out of which only 959.6 MLD has the treatment Capacity. Waste water generation from cities and towns along NW -1 in U ttar Pradesh segment generated 422.6 MLD i.e. 26% of total wastewater generation. Waste water generation from cities and towns along NW -1 in Bihar segment is 376.5 MLD i.e. 14% of total wastewater generation. The major city is Patna which generates 249.2 M LD of total waste water generated from this stretch. The cities/towns located along NW -1segment of West Bengal generate about 1311 MLD i.e. about 50 %. Out of the total waste water generation in NW -1 segment. Kolkata alone contributes47% and Howrah generat es 10% of the total waste water generation of west Bengal stretch. The municipal and bio -medical waste management facility is available at select cities only along the entire stretch of NW -1. Common Hazardous waste facility is available only at Haldia in NW-1 area. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 272 7.7.2 Possible Impact on VECs Induced impacts are anticipated on existing land resources due to development of NW -1 project like development of terminals with multimodal connectivity, RoRo jetties and associated infrastructure. These are li kely to have impact on existing infrastructure like roads (ODR, MDR, SH and NH), tourism sites and facilities and infrastructure. It would increase pressure on natural resources, existing solid and liquid waste handling facilities, disturbance to ghats and practices. However, development of NW -1 will provide facilities for improved passenger ferry services and connectivity. These impacts are described below. Pre-Construction/Design and Construction Stage Land is one of the major requirements for project de velopment. At some of the proposed site it is also required to acquire private land or common public land. For the planned civil interventions under Jal Marg Vikas Project, it is required to acquire the land. At present acquisition of private land is requi red for Sahibganj & Varanasi terminal. However, in case of Haldia terminal and Farakka lock land belongs to Haldia Dock Complex and no acquisition of land will be required. Private land area of 5.685 ha and area of 61.38 ha/151.71 acres (44.92 ha/111 acres in phase I) will be acquired for Varanasi terminal and Sahibganj terminal respectively. Apart from private land area, 19 acres of Government land will also be required for development of the Sahibganj terminal. Land at Varanasi is agricultural land but is not being used for agricultural purpose by people. However, land at Sahibganj site is being used by farmers for carrying out agricultural activities for earning livelihood. Also there are few household and community temples located at terminal site. Acqui sition of land will disturb their livelihood & living and will make them landless. However, it is proposed to provide them adequate compensation as per R & R Act, 2013 and resettlement & rehabilitation of the displaced population should be as per R & R Pla n. Further land may be required for setting up labour camps, batching plant etc. But the land will be required temporarily for construction phase. Adequate compensation should be given for the land to be used for these activities and then the land should b e rehabilitated in its original condition before handing back to the owner. Any utility or CPR like community temple, school, hospital, hand pump, well etc. if required to be shifted should be shifted immediately after the dismantling so as to minimize dis turbance to people. Shifting should preferably be carried out on private land. Construction activities at sites of civil intervention involves excavation, filling, parking of machinery/equipment etc. which may be threat to the population and can lead to any accident. Thus it is required that site should be barricaded and entry to the site should be strictly restricted to authorized personnel only. Construction of the terminal will require transportation of raw material to the site and debris from the site . Transportation of material may increase pressure on the roads which are used by villagers. Thus the haul roads should be well maintained and in case any diversion of traffic is required on these land alternate arrangements should be made. Traffic managem ent is utmost required so as to prevent the congestion &accidents on these roads during peak hours. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 273 Construction activities will generate high dust and noise levels which can be uncomfortable for nearby residing population. However, no habitation is with in 100 m of all planned site but to mitigate this impact measures for controlling air and noise pollution are proposed to be taken during construction phase. These measures will significantly reduce the emissions and noise level. Development of the proje ct will generate employment options for local people as construction worker, supervisors etc. thereby improving the quality of life of people. Operation Stage Civil intervention works will involve development of terminals, jetties, locks, river training work, bank and bed erosion/scour protection works etc. These developments will lead to further development of infrastructure like roads to connect these sites to the existing roads, water supply system, power supply system etc. All these facilities will al so be beneficial for nearby residing population. River bank protection works, construction of bunds/levees etc. will help in controlling the floods in area thus will be beneficial for people. Development of NW-1 project does not involve extraction of water from the river, thus no impact is anticipated on existing irrigational schemes set up on the NW -1. All the civil intervention works are components of Jal Marg Vikas project which aims at enhancing the IWT mode of freight transportation. IWT is most envir onment friendly, cost efficient and safest mode of transportation. Transportation of material through waterway will reduce the risk of accidents, cost of transportation and GHG emissions associated with transportation. Reduced cost of transportation will r educe the ultimate cost of the goods to be manufactured thereby benefiting the consumers. Increased freight movement and low transportation cost will boost the economy of the country. Shift of freight from road or railway to waterway will also reduce the G HG emissions & other associated pollutants with the project. Also this will reduce the pressure on existing roads and railways there by reducing the need of further land acquisition for expansion or development of new roads. Project will also generate lar ge scale direct and indirect employment for unskilled, semiskilled and skilled workers. Employment opportunity will improve the quality of life of people in the area. Project may also induce development of various other facilities like warehouses, industri es, roads, power supply etc. in the area. Thus project will lead to overall development of the whole area. However, there are some negative impacts of the project at sites of proposed interventions. Traffic movement near these sites will increase due to increased nos. of vehicles carrying goods to & fro from these sites. Increased traffic involves generation of increased air emissions, increased pollution, increased noise level and increased risks of accidents in the area. Increased traffic will exert the pressure on the existing roads near the site. All these may increase the pollution level in the area and quality of life of people in nearby area may get Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 274 affected. Thus it is required to upgrade the infrastructure like roads which will be used for project during operation phase and adoption of proposed pollution control measures to minimize the negative impact of project on society. Development of these civil interventions also may impact the quality of River Ganga. People are spiritually attached with the river thus impact on the quality of water of River Ganga will impact the sentiment and spiritual value of people. Increased cargo movement may also hamper fishing movement or damage the fishing gear of fishermen. Also there may be chances of reduction of fish yield in the river due to increased barge movement and increased pollution thereby impacting livelihood of farmers. Mitigation measures are required to be taken to prevent the impact on socio -economic environment 7.7.3 Strategic Recommendations Pre-Construction/Design and Construction Stage Separate SIA, LA and RAP are being prepared for the sites which involves land acquisition. Adequate compensation should be given to the people losing the land People have sentiments associated with River Ganga so relocation of people should also be given near to River only as desired by them Shifting of utilities/CPRs if any shall be done immediately so as to minimize disturbance to the people or owner of the utility. Shifting should preferably be carried out at p rivate land. The location proposed for shifting should also be acceptable by people. Skill training and assistance should be given to people so as they can get other jobs or get into other business. NGOs should be hired for this purpose Small loans should be given to the farmers losing the land and wishing to start new business Infrastructure development in form of small school, hospital, library etc. can be undertaken in the village as compensation to the disturbance caused Rest area should be provided at site in which workers can rest after the lunch hours and should not lie at site in open. This will help in preventing the accidents at site Adequate illumination should be provided at site during evening and night time till the work is being carried out Site should be barricaded and should have entry guarded by security guard. Register should be maintained for entry of outsiders. No unauthorized person should be allowed to enter the site especially village children A board should be displayed at entrance o f site displaying name of project, area and hazards associated with the site on entrance and activities prohibited within and near site area in local language Workers should wear the personal protective equipment like helmet, gum boots, safety shoes, safet y jackets, ear plugs, gloves etc. while working Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 275 Noise level in the work zone should be maintained and followed as per OSHAS norms. Non-productive lands, barren lands, raised lands; wastelands should be used for setting up labour camps, plant sites and deb ris disposal site. Agricultural land should be avoided. Land should be used for establishment of construction camps, debris disposal site and plant site only after obtaining consent from land owner. Fishermen should be consulted prior restricting fishing activity in the activity area Necessary permits should be obtained by contractor from concerned authorities for setting up any batching plant or hot mix plant. Labour camps, plant sites and debris disposal site should not be located close to habitations, schools, hospitals, religious places and other community places.

Pe ople should be communicated about the facility & system of grievance redressal so as they can launch their complaints, if any easily. Fishing activity should not be restricted in the river. Alternate provision for fishermen should be given in case fishing activity is restricted. 7.7.4 Responsibility for implementation IWAI, PMU and Contractors will have direct responsibility in effective implementation and internal monitoring of environment management plan and mitigation measures. Compliance to conditi ons as set out by various regulatory authorities will be monitored by concerned Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 279 regulatory authorities. NHAI, PWD, DFFCIL, Indian Railways, vessel owners, cargo operators, dredge operators, tourist operators and other developers of infrastructure and users of NW -1 shall comply with conditions set out in EMP and implement mitigation measures. 7.8 Opportunity and Access to Improved and Conserved Livelihood 7.8.1 Baseline Status of VECs Ganga along the NW -1 state is intrinsically linked to the economy o f the area. It provides the necessary silt in much of the land around it, increasing its fertility. Paddy is the greatest crop of the region. Agriculture is the main source of the livelihood generation for the people residing along the NW -1 area. Many town s in the area are primarily industrial. Ganga provides the necessary infrastructure for the factories to perform. Commercial fisheries in the Ganga River System are an important source of livelihood for the people residing along the Ganga River. Ganga is the most important river and source of livelihood for countless fishers inhabiting on its bank. The fishery in the potamon zone of the river is mainly represented by the species belonging to Cyprinidae and Siluridae families. There is substantial decline i n major carps fish catch in Allahabad to Farakka stretch over past few years. In recent period, the fishery showed some improvement due to emergence of exotic species, specifically C. carpio and O. niloticus. At Buxer hilsa was the main fishery and with th e commissioning of Farakka barrage the fishery declined sharply between 1972 -80. Fishery improved during 1981 -86 due to improvement in landings of other species. Patna centre also showed drastic decline in major carp landings and as compared to sixties it was almost half during 1986 - 93. Decline at Bhagalpur was not as severe as at other centres. Gupta and Tyagi (1991) have discussed the fishery of Ganga with an analytical approach and showed that the fishery is harvested at a level higher than the optimum f ishing level and efforts should be made to reduce the fishing pressure to obtain a sustainable fishery from the system. Fishermen Population and Fishing pattern: It is very important to know the total number of fishers involved in capture fisheries in th e NW -1 stretch. It is reported that almost every village along the both sides of the river are having some fishermen who earn their livelihood by fishing in the Ganga river. There is no census data available regarding fishers specifically involved in captu re fisheries in the whole NW -1 stretch. Generally, one member of the family is engaged in fishing in lower stretch of NW -1(Farakka to Haldia), sometimes two, the average comes to be 1.5. However, in upper stretch (Allahabad to Farakka) the average person e ngaged in fishing is 1.2 that is mainly due to low fish catch in this stretch. The fishermen do fishing for 5 -12 hours daily, depending upon the season. Fishing activities is very less during monsoon season. Fishing is the main occupation to 90% of the fis hermen, which contribute to more than 80% of their household income. Other major occupation includes fish vending, ferry service, tourism, driving and daily labour. Most of the fishermen do not have agricultural land and small amount of income comes from Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 280 labour wage, service, and petty business. In the season of less catch the youth generally engage themselves in labour works or rickshaw van pulling to earn their livelihood. Fishing Income: The monthly average income of the fisherman ranged from Rs.4000 t o 7000 per month in Allahabad to Patna stretch. However, in Varanasi stretch the most of the fisherman is engaged in boating and ferry services now and earning more than fishing. In lower zone (Farakka to Haldia) the average income of fisherman is slightly high and ranging between 7000 to Rs. 10,000 per month because of higher catch and high value fish (mainly hilsa) in the catch. Fishing Crafts: For fishing purpose mainly small or medium sized boats was used. As compared to sixties, the availability of b oats per fishermen showed an increase, this may be due to change in fishing pattern. As in past mainly dragnets were used for fishing involving only two boats and more than 10 fishers in a fishing unit. With the passage of time dragnets have lost their pla ce and fishers have switched over to gill nets involving maximum 2 -3 persons and a boat. Single piece tin made fishing craft dingi are mostly found in Farakka and surrounding stretch and whereas the wooden boats/ big crafts are mostly found in the lower zone near Haldia. Nets & Gears: Dragnets, dip net, gill nets, traps, bag nets are commonly used by the fisherman along the NW -1 stretch. Gill nets availability was highest in Patna, Munger and Bhagalpur stretch of NW -1 and lower in Allahabad and Mirzapur stretch of NW -1. Availability of dragnets was low in almost Allahabad to Farakka stretches. Large dragnets were not present at all. Use of hook and lines were mainly in the Allahabad and Mirzapur stretches of NW -1 whereas traps were more in district Ballia and Bihar stretches. Small scoop nets were available in the entire stretch but large size was available only in lower stretches down to Farakka. Dip nets were observed in Allahabad and Mirzapur districts. Various forms of gill nets and bag nets are fou nd to be operated by the fishers. Among them gill nets are most prevalent throughout the NW -1 stretch. Around 80% of the fishers were using the gear. The gill nets have different local names like Current jal, Nagin jal, Kajli jal, Phasa jal, Bhola jal, Ghero Dhoali jal, Gule jal, Pungus jal, etc. A number of variations in material and mesh size in gill nets are observed depending upon the targeted fishes. However, drift gill nets are the major nets used to catch hilsa, the main migratory fis h of Bhagirathi - Hooghly river system. All different types of gill nets have their distinct seasonality in operation depending upon the availability of the target species. Fishing sites and Jal/net operation in river: Most of the gears, bigger nets are op erated inside the river for quite long time. Few bigger nets like Khelpa jal / Bachari jal and hooks can operate from river bank. Gears, bigger nets are more frequently used by the fisherman near Farakka and downstream of Farakka to Haldia. However, the us e of Gears and bigger nets is not so common in upper reach from Rajmahal to Allahabad. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 281 7.8.2 Possible Impact on VECs As per study carried out by CIFRI \"Impact analysis on Ecology, Flora and Fauna including Fish and Fisheries due to movement of Barges carrying coal through National waterway no. 1 (Sagar to Farakka)\", it is found that barge movement significantly impact the fishing operations in that stretch resulting in reduction in their income. Thus similar nature impacts are anticipated due to the p roject. Stretch downstream of Farakka is already impacted due to existing barge movement. Impacts on stretch upstream of Farakka are anticipated to be comparatively lower than the stretch downstream. Fishing is done using large nets placed across the river in areas near Farakka and downstream of Farakka, whereas in areas upstream Farakka fishing is done near the bank areas using small size mesh gill net, traps and hooks and lines. However, increased plying of vessels is likely to disrupt/ come in conflict w ith the current fishing activities/ practices, small boat/ferry services operators which will impact associated livelihoods. On the other hand, due to operationalisation of NW -1 Project, increased opportunities of inland water transportation and av ailability of commodities will directly or indirectly benefit consumers due to cheaper transport of variety of commodities. Cargo and logistic operators will be benefited which will create direct/ indirect livelihood and income generating activities. Tour ism sector will receive a boost since diversification of inland waterways tourism and related activities will generate direct/ indirect livelihood and income generating activities 7.8.3 Strategic Recommendations Barge/vessel movement will be restr icted to the designated navigation route only. Maintenance of buoys, beacons, signs, gauges to mark the navigation channel Crew of the vessel carrying especially oil should be competent and experienced so as they can prevent the damage to fishing gears and boats. Marking of navigation channel through beacons and communicating information about the navigation channel monthly to fishermen and the expected timing or frequency of barges to fishing community so as they can be pre -informed and the damage to thei r boats and gears can be reduced. Barge movement schedule should be prepared in advance and should be shared with the fishermen Regularizing the barge speed to 7 -8 knots in bending areas so as bank erosion can be reduced due to barge movement resulting in lesser turbidity, enhanced planktonic growth and thus increased fish yield. River training works should be carried out at the bank locations which are prone to erosion to reduce the turbidity in shallow areas and its impact on fish yield. All measures to reduce the water quality pollution & to prevent damage to ecology due to barge movement as proposed above should be adequately addressed and implemented so as to minimise impact on fish yield due to the project. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 282 In case of damage of fishing nets, fishing c rafts and other gears of fishers, arising due to barge operation, appropriate and quick compensations may be given to the aggrieved fishers. The barges may be fitted with powerful searchlight and may sound horn so that fishermen can realize arrival of barg e at least from 500 m -1 km away to prevent damage to fishing nets Regular consultations to be carried out with the fishing communities to get their feedback on the impact due to barge movement on fishing and problems they are facing Support shall be exte nded in terms of supporting setting up fish nurseries for improving fish productivity and training awareness of fishermen for better fishing techniques through institute of repute like CIFRI. 7.8.4 Responsibility for implementation IWAI, PMU and Contra ctors will have direct responsibility in effective implementation and internal monitoring of environment and social management plan and mitigation measures. Compliance to conditions as set out by various regulatory authorities will be monitored by concerne d regulatory authorities. Vessel owners, cargo operators, dredge operators, tourist operators and other users of NW -1 shall comply with conditions set out in EMP and implement mitigation measures. Research and development agencies, e.g. CIFRI, Fisheries departments, socio -economic and livelihood development agencies and experts may be brought on board, as deemed necessary. 7.9 Maintain the Cultural Values 7.9.1 Baseline Status of VECS Ganga River is worshipped in India and holds an important place as it is considered sacred and holy river in Hindu religion. Hindu people believe that holy dip in river Ganga washes their sins. This dip is considered more important at religious places at Allahabad and Varanasi located along NW -1. Hindus also believe that bathing in the river on certain special occasions and periods causes the forgiveness of sins and helps attain salvation. People also travel from distant places to immerse the ashes of their kin in the waters of the Ganga. This immersion also is believed t o send the ashes to heaven. Various festivals are organised on the bank of rivers at different places and different period. These festivals attract very large crowds and may have bearing even on movement of barges in NW -1 during festival periods. The list of culturally and religiously important places with its festivals along the NW -1 is given at Table 7.3. Table 7. 3: Culturally and Religiously Important Places with Fair and Festivals Sl. No. City Place Fairs & Festivals 1 Allahabad Sangam Kumbh Mela: The confluence of the 3 rivers Ganga, Jamuna and the sacred and mythological river Saraswati at Sangam is considered to be quite auspicious for Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 283 Sl. No. City Place Fairs & Festivals the Hindus. It is said that when Lord Vishnu carried a pot or Kumbha of Nectar or Amrita, a fight broke out among the gods. In the milieu, four nectar drops fell on the earth at the four place which are known as the Tirthas and include Nasik, Haridwar, Prayad and Ujjain. These places are therefore considered as place where the mortal humans can pass on to a celestial world form the human world. In each of these locations, there is a kumbha mela held but on the 12th year, the mela is organized in Allahabad as it is considered the most sacred of the Tirthas. The Greatest Kumbha Mela is held in Allahabad which is also kn own as Maha Kumbha Mela and is the biggest fair related to religious practices. Magh Mela: Apart from the Maha Kumbh and another kumbh mela by the there is the Magh Mela. Maha kumbh is held every 12th year in the city of Allahabad whic h is a sacred city in the state of Uttar Pradesh. As because the Magh Mela falls during the period of Magh months of Jan and Feb, so the name has been given. During this period, the devotees take a holy bath at the confluence of the 3 rivers believing that the waters will wash away their sins. 2 Varanasi Ghats There are more than 100 ghats along the Ganga river at Varanasi (steps leading to the water of the Ganges). The banks of the Holy River at Varanasi are the most preferred cremation grounds. Ghat s Panch Parikrama: This parikrama starts and finishes at Manikarnika Ghat and has the great importance in ancient Parikrama of India. The devotee will pass through the five great places thats why it has named so behind this. The five places of whi ch the devotees have to round up and This festival is being celebrated in the months of October and November which is the tourism festival of Varanasi that is being celebrated from Prabodhani Ekadashi to Kartik Purnima (November month) ending by a dance presentation at Ganga Mahotsav. The rich cultural heritage of Varanasi is being reflected by this festival. Besides various cultural programs a nd the boat racing the martial arts are also presented. This festival also corresponds with another traditional festival of Dev Deepavali in which all the ghats of Varanasi are enlightened by thousands of Diyas. Dhrupad Mela: This mela is basically a music festival that is organized on the Tusli Ghat for five days (Feb or March month) in which the renowned artists of the area give their performances. This mela is especially famous among the foreign tourists. 3. Bihar & Jharkhand Ghats Chatth Puja: Chhath is an ancient Hindu festival dedicated to the worship of the Lord Sun in November month and is mainly celebrated in Bihar and Jharkhand on the banks of Ganga. 7.9.2 Possible Impact on VECs Barge movement though restricted to the defined navigation ch annel but have potential to impact and interrupt the fest and festivals and other day to day activities being carried out or performed at river by the people. There are several festivals which are being celebrated at River Ganga and several rituals being p erformed at River by people. These activities are also likely to be impacted due to increased barge movement. Some of the important festivals are Kumbh at Allahabad -Nov) and Ganga Sagar Mela at Sagar (January). Thus, it is essential that barge movement should be regularized at these locations during these festivals so as to prevent social conflicts. Apart from this, there are about 100 ghats at Varanasi used for various purposes like bathing, idol immersion and performing last rites ( asthi visarjan) and other rituals. Cremation ceremony is performed at Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 284 several locations along the bank of river. Also locals of nearby villager s (both males and females) bath in river. Barge movement could be uncomforting for the female bathing in the river. Barge movement may bring certain social conflict if appropriate and timely measures are not put in place. 7.9.3 Strategic Recommendations Ensure availability of water including around the ghats and maintenance of water quality fit for bathing and performing rites and rituals. No waste in any form shall be discharged by vessel in the river so as to improve and maintain the quality of wate r Vessel movement shall be restricted or regularised during the identified major festival period as listed in section 2.0. Support for establishment of small enclosed areas dedicated for female bathing in every village along the NW -1 to allow female main tain their privacy. Support for improving cleanliness and at existing ghats at Varanasi and other locations Provision for improving/restoring selected Ghats, Kunds , etc. 7.9.4 Responsibility for implementation IWAI, PMU and Contractors will have dire ct responsibility in effective implementation and internal monitoring of environment management plan and mitigation measures. Compliance to conditions as set out by various regulatory authorities will be monitored by concerned regulatory authorities. Vesse l owners, cargo operators, dredge operators, tourist operators and other users of NW -1 shall comply with conditions set out in EMP and implement mitigation measures. 7.10 Maintain Cultural Events and Cultural Functions 7.10.1 Baseline Status of VECs River Ganga is of great cultural and religious significance for the Indians. All of this makes the Ganges a must for all tourists who wish to encounter all of Indias diverse beauty in terms of both culture and nature. There are many cities along the bank s of NW -1 specially Allahabad, Varanasi and Kolkata which are important from tourism prospective and attract thousands of religious and non religious tourists every year. Varanasi, a pilgrim place for Hindus and Buddhist alone attracts over one million pil grims every year followed by Allahabad. Pilgrimage and the associated tourism brings along a major source of revenue for religious towns and their people. There are several ghats, kunds, temples, shrines, etc. Kumbh, chhath constitutes cultural events and functions in and around Ganga. 7.10.2 Possible Impact on VECs Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 285 As per analysis and planning no dredging is proposed near the important cultural areas/Ghat. Placement of dredgers in river may disrupt the fishing activities, however dredging activities at any particular location will be for short duration and thus the impacts will not be significant. Dredging operations generate noise of 80 dB(A) which can create discomfort for the population residing on the banks specially in the night time. Dredging oper ations required manpower for carrying and controlling dredging operations. Thus generation of employment for skilled, semi -skilled and unskilled labour can be taken as positive impact of dredging operations. Dredging operations will enable navigation of th e barges in the waterway throughout the year thereby increasing the IWT mode of transportation. This will have positive socio -economic impact in terms of employment generation. 7.10.3 Strategic Recommendations Dredging operations should be restricted p rimarily to day time, i.e. 6:00 Am -10:00 Pm only to minimize noise impacts on the residents of nearby settlements. Dredgers should be equipped with the noise reduction/masking equipment to reduce the noise generation Dredgers should be placed in consultat ion with the fishermen so as to minimize the impact on their equipment/gears and their fishing activities Dredging should not be carried out in the areas close to Ghats in Varanasi and buffer of 2 km should be maintained for dredging during time of religio us gatherings during Chhat and Kumbh festivals. In case contaminated dredged material is disposed on land, then it should be disposed at approved TSDF sites to prevent any harm to community residing in nearby areas. One of such approved TSDF site is locat ed Sagar (Haldia Dock Complex site) Material to be disposed on land may create nuisance odour due to exposure of anaerobic sediments with air. Thus if land disposal is involved than disposal site should not be in upwind direction of any settlement area or sensitive locations like hospitals, schools etc. Log book should be maintained for recording the accidents at site/mortality of the any aquatic mammal and other fauna should be maintained. Analysis shall be carried out to assess the reason for the accide nt/mortality and measures should be taken to prevent repetition of the event. Contractors having experience of dredging and well trained staff should only be allowed to carry out dredging. This will help in prevention of spillage of dredged material or an y accidents during the dredging operations. Dredging plan should be prepared by contractor and submitted to IWAI for approval prior to carrying out dredging operations. Dredging plan should be reviewed considering its location w.r.t environmental sensitive locations/archaeological locations/cultural festival/pollution influx in the area/dredged material quality & texture/available depth etc. Contractors should submit method statement & risk assessment plan prior to carrying out any dredging work. Dredger s hould follow the defined safety procedures to avoid Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 286 accidents and spills, and IWAI should ensure that other vessel users are provided with adequate information and instruction to avoid conflict with the dredgers. Post-dredging monitoring of the sediment na ture, rate of sedimentation shall be made part of contractors job as best dredging practise. This will provide information which can be taken into consideration before the next maintenance dredge is carried out. Re-use of dredged material should be explo red if dredged material is not contaminated. Economically and environmentally feasible options can be adopted to minimize the dredge spoil burdens. Some of such measures include o Dredged sediment can be used for beach nourishment/ development of artificial beach/deposition on shoal & thus enrichment of habitat o Dredged material can be explored for its usage for coast/bank protection purpose/flood protection o Use of dredged material can be explored for land filling, as construction material for road foundations , dikes, mounds, noise/wind barriers. 7.10.4 Responsibility for implementation IWAI, PMU and Contractors will have direct responsibility in effective implementation and internal monitoring of environment management plan and mitigation measures. Complian ce to conditions as set out by various regulatory authorities will be monitored by concerned regulatory authorities. Vessel owners, cargo operators, dredge operators, tourist operators and other users of NW -1 will comply with conditions set out in EMP and implement mitigation measures. 7.11 Conserve Heritage Sites, Structures and Values 7.11.1 Baseline Status of VECs Archeological Survey of India has notified monuments as archeologically protected. 77 monuments falling in the districts through which NW-1 is passing is listed at Table 7.4.

As per Indian regulation no construction activity can take place within 300 m of archeologically protected monuments/ structures/site without written permission from archeological department. Such permissions may necessarily be obtained from archeological department. 7.11.4 Responsibility for implementati on IWAI, PMU and Contractors will have direct responsibility in effective implementation and internal monitoring of environment management plan and mitigation measures. Compliance to conditions as set out by various regulatory authorities will be monitor ed by concerned regulatory authorities. 7.12 Other Benefits Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 290 7.12.1 Strategic Recommendations Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) Council, is mandated to promote development o f buildings and habitats in India through GRIHA. It is recommended that the GRIHA is followed in proposed development of terminals, etc. by IWAI and by other developers on account of induced development spurred by NW -1 project particularly in the influence area. Energy Conservation Building Code ( ECBC) ECBC was developed by the Govt. of India for new commercial buildings on 27th May 2007. ECBC sets minimum energy standards for commercial buildings having a connected load of 100kW or contract demand o f 120 KVA and above. the ECBC has been integrated in other rating & compliance systems being followed in the country such as EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) for large area development under MoEFCC, Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIH A) rating system of ADARSH and Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) rating system of the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). It is recommended that ECBC is followed in proposed development of terminals, etc. by IWAI and by other develope rs on account of induced development spurred by NW -1 project particularly in the influence area. Environmental Health & Safety Policy and EHS Management System An effective environmental health and safety policy is essentially required to be prepared for the project and it should be communicated to the workforce through displaying posters/bill boards/posters/glow boards and campaigning around the work site. Posters should be in Hindi, English & Regional language so as it can be understood by the workfo rce. Verbal communication through campaigning also should be carried out. Some of the important days such as Environment Day (June 5), Red Cross Month (March), Emergency Preparedness Week (May 1 -7), National safety day (4th April), National Health Day (7th April), Fire safety day (14th April), 20th April (Earth day) can be planned for spreading the awareness for Environment Protection, Cleanliness and safety among work force through campaigning. For effective and systematic implementation of the project, it is desirable that IWAI (The EA) develops its Environmental and Social management systems which is auditable and effectively enforceable. Parallel can be drawn from the experience of National Highway Authority of India or Delhi Metro Rail Corporation and adopt EHS system on the similar lines. Each contractor should be contractually bound to follow such system and must have EHS management system in line with EAs management system. IWAI should also develop its standard technical guidelines for Environmenta l Assessment, Management and Reporting. Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 291 Environmental Standards for operation and maintenance of Various Civil Interventions, Barge Movement and Dredging Operations Mentioned activities have potential to pose threat on the environmental quality. Regulator y Authorities of India and other countries have specified certain limits of pollutants which, if maintained, environmental pollution can be maintained. The Environmental standards applicable for the operation and maintenance stage of the project and that s hould be adhered to are listed below. Standards for discharged of effluent in inland surface water bodies and Marine Coastal Areas (Source: G.S.R 422 (E) dated 19.05.1993 and G.S.R 801 (E) dated 31.12.1993 issued under the provisions of E (P) Act 1986) Classification of Surface water Bodies on basis of Quality (Source: Guidelines for Water Quality Management -CPCB, 2008) Water Quality Standards for Coastal Waters, SW -IV & V -Harbour and Navigation & controlled waste disposal (EIA Guidance Manual for Ports & Harbours, MoEF&CC, GoI) Standards for permissible level of water quality indicators (Source: Assessment of the Environmental Impact of Port Development, United Nations, New York, 1992) Permissible limit for off -shore dumping of dredged material (Source: As sessment of the Environmental Impact of Port Development, United Nations, New York, 1992) Criteria for harmful bottom sediments (Source: Assessment of the Environmental Impact of Port Development, United Nations, New York, 1992) Approximate Quantity of S uspended Sediments Generated by Dredging or Dumping Operations (Source: Assessment of the Environmental Impact of Port Development, United Nations, New York, 1992) MARPOL 73/78 for prevention of pollution from ships SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) as per la test amendments (Chapter I -XII) CPWD Norms for construction of off -shore works, river bank protection structure, carrying out dredging works, river training works Zero discharge from vessels and proposed terminals Zero discharge is recommended at all ter minals site to minimize water pollution from the site and from plying vessels to address potential pollution. Zero Emissions and reduction of GHG emissions NW-1 operational strategy should aim for zero emissions. This should include alternate fuel e.g. C NG or renewable energy e.g. solar powered based barge/ vessel operations. GHG accounting should be carried out especially for terminal and operation related movement of NW 1.This should also include GHG avoided & added vis a vis rail and road transport. 7.12.2 Responsibility for implementation Cumulative Impact Assessment Report of National Waterways -1 292 IWAI, PMU and Contractors will have direct responsibility in effective implementation and internal monitoring of environment management plan and mitigation measures. Compliance to conditions as set out by various regulatory authorities will be monitored by concerned regulatory authorities. NHAI, PWD, DFFCIL, Indian Railways, vessel owners, cargo operators, dredge operators, tourist operators and other developers of infrastructure and users of NW -1 shall comply wit h EHS Management System, Environment standards as well conditions set out in EMP and implement mitigation measures.

Geomorphic features in the channel belt and active floodplain along the Ganga River pertaining to NW -1 stretch is described below. Allahabad to Varanasi stretch: The river stretch between Allahabad and Varanasi (Figure 3.1) over a length of 245 km is a unique segment of the Ganga River as it nearly approaches (~7 km; near Meja) the peninsular shield and exhib its a strong basement/tectonic control with a maximum sinistral shift of about 16 km towards SSE (Allahabad). In addition, these two cities are the most popular religious centers along the river course. The mapping of the river course based on remote sensi ng data with limited field checks has shown the various geomorphic units with their respective numbers and areal coverage which includes mid -channel bars (134.59 sq km), point bars (110.76 sq km), alluvial islands (56.17 sq km), lateral bars (245.34 sq km) , meander scrolls (3.18 sq km), flood channels (9.42 sq km), and vegetation patches (69.17 sq km). The width of the flood plain varies between 1.4 (SE of Handia) and 8.4 km (near Mirjapur). The maximum (14.2 km) and minimum (1.8 km) valley margin width ha ve noted ~63 km downstream of Allahabad and Varanasi, respectively. The distinctive feature of this stretch of the Ganga River is its partly confined valley fills (cratonic) nature between Chunar and Mirjapur and the remaining part is grouped under unconfi ned alluvial valley. Figure 3.1 Geomorphic map of the Allahabad to Varanasi stretch 4 | P a g e Varanasi to Munger stretch The geomorphic map in this stretch has been presented into two parts, one from Varanasi to Madhubani (Figure. 3.2a) and then from Madhubani to Munger (Figure. 3.2b). The minimum width of floodplain in this stretch is 1.8 km downstream Varanasi, while the maximum width went up to 28 km near Ara. The mi nimum Valley margin width is 7 km d/s Varanasi, while the maximum Valley margin width increases to 36.1 km at the location 23 km d/s Buxar. Alluvial Islands are a significant geomorphic characteristic in this reach of Ganga river (Figure 8a, b). While the first island 30 km downstream of Buxar is only 3.0 km in width, 2 major islan ds of over 12 km. maximum wid th are present u /s and d/s Patna and there are 2 more islands further downstream -- between Barh -Mokama (5.5 km max. width) and upstream of Munger (2.0 km wide). Alluvial islands seem to gain prominence in width / area downstream of the confluence of Ghaghra and Gandak rivers from the North and Son river from the South, probably due to the contribution of a huge sediment load from the Himalayan terrain. Two major areas of meandering belts, one each on the northern and southern banks of Ganga river, d/s of Varanasi between Zamania and Buxar, have been identified. Another special stretch between Buxar and Ara (downstream) and confined only to the southern bank of river Ganga, is a zone of meander scrolls, mea nder scars and ox -bow lakes. Figure 3.2(a): Geomorphic map of the Varanasi to Madhubani stretch 5 | P a g e Figure 3.2(b) Geomorphic map of the Madhubani to Munger stretch Munger to Farakka strtech Total along channel length of the studied a rea is about 330 km and the valley setting is semi - confined (Figure 3.3). The southern margin is controlled by basement rocks of the craton whereas the northern valley margin is unconfined and merges with/bound by the alluvium of Kosi and Mahananda river. Maximum floodplain width in the study stretch is about 23.3 km and minimum width 7.2 km. The sinuosity of the stretch has increased a little bit as compared to the immediately upstream stretch, but the river is braided all through the sector with many mid- channel bar or large islands, lateral bar, etc. The increase in sinuosity is plausibly related to irregular configuration of the basement block on the southern margin of the valley (e.g. Munger - Bhagalpur -Sahibganj stretch). The major geomorphic characteristic of the river in this stretch is the braided -sinuous pattern, with numerous fine-grained sandy bars in channel (Fig. 3.3). These channels are extremely mobile and the active channel is seen to migrate more than a km within a year. Active floodplain is marked by abandoned meander and braided bars. Abandoned channel and bar accretion surfaces at places marked fine clayey fine -grained sediment. Levees, newly grown bars and many abandoned slough channels (flood channels) over braid bars are marked by dry sandy patches. Most of these abandoned bars (now part of the floodplain) and in channel large islands are now agricultural fields. 6 | P a g e Figure 3.3: Geomorphic map of the Munger to Farakka stretch 7 | P a g e ANNEXURE 3.2 8 | P a g e Annexure 3.2: Identified Hotspots and VECs in Basin Below Allahabad Table 3.1: Biosphere Reserves located in the Ganga Basin1 Name Location details Nearest Tributary Type Date of Notification Area in Sq.

Dams a nd Barrages Figure 1 shows major dams and barrages erected in the Ganga River Network [ MoWR, 2014]. Dams and barrages often help to meet several anthropogenic needs such as water supply, hydropower generation, flood control and navigation. But these obstru ctions have divided National River Ganga and her tri butaries into small segments, thereby interrupting the flow of water, nutrient, se diments and aquatic sp ecies in the rivers. In the Upper Ganga Basin, t he obstru ctions include cascades of run-of-the-river (ROR) hydro- electric projects in the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda head streams. Many of these projects are constr ucted or planned end to end, i.e. the tail waters of one project are head waters of the next one, so that the ri ver gets transf ormed into a seri es of res ervoirs. Moreover, the water s tored behind a dam is sent through tunnels to turbines and released as tail waters at downstream points of the rivers. Thus, long stretches of rivers between dams and tail-water releases are almost devoid of water. Overall, an estimated 86 km length of River Bhagirathi is thus without any flow what soever [IITC, 2 014a]. Besides, sediments get trapped behind the dams, thereby disrupting the downstream ri ver's wate r- sediment balance and affecting nutrient flow and fertility of the downstream river. More than 70 hydropower projects (large and small dams) have been conceived in the Upper Ganga Basin, many of which are still in the planning stage. While there have been environmental impact studies of some individual dams, the only comprehensive study of their cumu lative e nvironmental impact in the river sub-basins was made by the Wildlife Institute of India [Rajvanshi, 2012]. However, the study was limited in scope. For instance, its focus did not ext end beyond the Bhaghirathi and Alak nanda sub-basins, so that the impact of the dams over the downstream river's e cology remained unexplored. It may be also noted here that, while many of these dams are small, the common notion that small dams have relativ ely insignificant impacts on river ecosystems is a misconception. In some cases, the cumu lative impact of small dams may be more damaging to river ecosystems than those of large dams of equivalent power generation capacity [Kibler and Tullo s, 2013]. 71 | P a g e Figure 5.3.4: Major structur al obstructions on Riv er Ganga and her tributaries within India [MoWR, 2014] 7 72 | P a g e Downs tream of the hydroelectric projects in the Bhagirat hi and Alak nanda basins, the Pashulok barrage on River Ganga near Rishik esh diverts nearly all the dry-weather flow of main Gan ga river into the power channel of Chilla Power Station. The tail water of this power station joins the Gan ga river near Bhoopatwala. Thus, a distance of about 15 km from Pashulok barrage to the junction of the tail waters w ith the river has essentially no flow. Further downstream, Bhimgauda Barrage, Madhya Ganga Barrage and Narora Barrage in tersect the river successively to divert water to the Upper, Middle and Lo wer Ga nga Canals. Further downstream, River Ganga is again clipped at Kanpur by the Lav-Kush Barrage. Finally, as the river heads for the estuarine rea ch, it is again bifurcated by the Farakka Barrage in West Bengal, which diverts part of the flow in to a canal to f eed the Bhagirat hi-Hooghly river. Besides the above opera tions on the main Ganga river, major dams and barrages on her tributaries include the Ramganga Dam on Ramganga river in Ut tarakhand, the Asan Barrage, Dakpathar Barrage a nd Hathnikund Barrage (and the upcoming Lakhwar Dam) on River Yamuna, the Ichari Dam and Tons Barrage on River T ons, the Dhandhraul Dam on Ghaghra river, Gandhi Sagar Dam on Chambal river, the Rajghat, Parichha and Mata tila Dams on Betwa river, the Damodar rivers in Jharkhand, and the Durgapur Barrage on River Damodar in West Bengal [NIH, 2014]. Needless to say, the innumerable intercepts in t he Ganga river network have fragmented the once unified river network into disjointed stretches of flowing and stagnant water s. Dams and barrages trap much of the river sediments, converti ng the downstream r iver water into what is called hungry water - \"hungry water has sufficient energy to tra nsport sediment but the sediment has been captured behind the dam. The hungry water gradually consu mes the bed and banks of the river below the dam, resul ting in entrenchment and armoring of the bed\" [Wamp ler, 2 012]. The long-term ef fects of this process significantly affect the morphology of rivers and their floodplains [Graf, 2006; Gupta et al., 2012]. In addition to the direct impacts of dams and barrages on river g eomorp hology, the sediments trapped behind these structures may contain many mineral nutrients, thereby depriving the downstream r iver stretches of esse ntial nutrients. It may be noted that, apart from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, at least twenty five (and probably many more) elements are essential for plants and animals (namely, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Na, Cl, B, Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, Li, I, Se, Cr, V, Si, F, As, and Sn, vide Grah am, 2008). While knowledge of the effects of micro- nutrient deprivation in river ecosystems may be limite d, the effect of deprivation of essential macro-elements (like N and P) on ri ver biota have been studied [refer Elser et al., 2007]. In this context, a report by Zhou et al. [2013] on the effects of the Three Gorges Dam on phosphorus depletion in MLY (i.e. Middle and Lower Yangtze river) deserves mention. Until major dam constru ctions begun on River Yangtze in the 1990s, the river discharged a bout 940 km3/yr water and 478 Mt/yr of sediment into the East Sea, with the MLY stretch (about 2,000 km long below 73 | P a g e the Three Gorges Dam up to the estuary) getting little sediment added in the MLY reach. Zhou et al.'s study reveals that by 2011 (i.e. within 10 years of opera tion of the Three G orges Project) the total sediment load in MLY reduced to only 6% of its previous long-term average, thereby resulting in extensive sco uring of the river channel. Moreover, nutrient-rich fine sediment load reduced to only 8% of its long- term averag e. As a resul t, the Total P and Particulate P loads delivered to the MLY reduced to only 23% and 16.5% of their long-term values. Now P had alrea dy been a limiting nutrient for the Yangtze river's bioactivity before large dams came up on the river, hence its further reduction was critical for bioproductivity in MLY. 2. Hydrological Modeling of GRBMP and Inferences In order to obtain a quantitative picture of the hydrological status of NRGB and its likely change under various scenarios, hydrological modeling was carried ou t for the surface water and ground water system of the combined Gan ga basin area in India (i.e. NRGB) and Nepal covering 1,028,468 ,63 sq. km. area [ IITC, 2014c]. The SWAT (Soil and Water Assessm ent Tool) Mo del was adopted to simulate the surface water response of t he basin, the basin being subdivided into 1045 sub-basins f or model computations. The model results were calibra ted w ith observ ed river discharge data at 30 locations on the main stem a nd tributaries of the Ganga river network. The raw data used in cluded static spatial data (digital elevation data, draina ge network data, soil maps, soil characteristics, and land use data), dynamic hydro-meteorological data, and water demand and abstraction data. The model simulation was carried out for the period 1969-2006 (37 years) over the basin. The groundwater model was set up for the alluvi um part of the basin (shown in Figure 5.3.5) using MODFLOW computer model. 74 | P a g e Figure 5.3.5: Groundwater Mod el Area of Ganga Basin [IITC, 2014c] by data limitat ions such as absence of precipitation data for higher elevation areas, of canal water diversions, and of crop management (irrigation) practices. Besides, out of about 206 dams/ reser voirs in the basin, information was available on only 104 such structures, and canal command area information was also missing in some cases. Li mitations are also likely on the quality of data used for other anthropogenic parameters such as land use and groundwater abstractions. Subject to such constrain ts, the computational model was calibrated and valida ted against observed strea mflow data at about 24 f low measuring stations and groundwater data at about 100 observation wells. The summary outcome of surface water modeling is shown in Figure 5.3.6 in terms of the basin's 37-year average a nnual water balance components, viz.: (i) Total Streamflow (Wat er Yiel d) consisting of surface runoff, lateral and base flow, (ii) Precipitation, and (iii) Eva potranspirat ion. The monthly variation of the avera ge water balance components are shown in Figure 5.3.7. As evi dent from the figures, streamflow and evapotranspirat ion are the two main components of water outgo from the modeled area. It may be noted that, on an annual basis, the average ratio of eva potranspi ration to precipitation is found to be about 41 -42%, w hich is much higher than the govern ment norm of 23% for the Ganga basin but much lower than 60% suggested by Jain [2012] which were cited earlier in Section 4. 75 | P a g e Figure 5.3.6: Average (1969 -2006) Ann ual Water Balance of the Modeled Ganga Basin Figure 5.3.7: Average (1969-2006) Monthly Water Balance Compon ents of the Basin. Based on the above model resul ts, an analysis of the hydrologic flow health of the Ganga river and its important tributaries had also been carried out to obtain a nnual \"flow health scores\" of the rivers [IITC, 2014b]. In general, the study showed that the flow health scores had significantly altered in sever al stret ches of National River Ganga and her tributaries due to the present system of river wa ter management. However, the analysis does not cover many aspects of river health such as functional needs of ecosystems and habitats. Consid ering t his work as a first step to understand the significa nce of hydrology on the health of National River Ganga, it is envisaged that a more comprehensive assessm ent including ecological and g eomorphological consid erations of river health can be developed in fut ure within the broader 76 | P a g e framework of ecohydrology. The hydrological model was also run to sim ulate the hypothetical virgin river flows under the present climatic and land-use conditions by switching off all water resource projects and consid ering no groundwater abstraction in the basin. The \"virgin flows\" of different rivers of the network and their contri butions to the main stem of the river were thus obtained for the hypothetical virgin conditions over a 30-year period of model run to enable quantitative comparison with a ctual flows over this period. The main tri butaries of the Ganga river network (and some important flow and wat er quality measuring stations of CWC) are shown in the line diagram of Figure.5.8. Based on the mod el results, Figure 5.9 shows the estim ated changes in an nual flows of the major tributaries of the network. The resul ts indicate that, while t he changes in flow volumes are very small in the headstreams of Nation al River Gan ga, river flows are considerably reduced in her major tributaries such as Yamuna, Gha ghra, Gandak, K osi, Chambal, Sone, etc., thereby reducing the flow in the main Ganga river through most of her reach. Figures 5.10 and 5.11 show the comparisons of average virgin f lows and actual flows for the wet seas on (mid-June to mid-October) and dry season (mid- October to mid-June of following year), respectively. As evident from the figures, the differences between virgin and present flows in most rivers are much more pronounced in the dry season than the wet period, with dry season flows having drastically re duced in some rivers such as Ramganga, Chambal, Yamuna and Damodar. Thus, it can be definitively concluded that anthropogenic hydrological interventions have significantly curtailed t he annual flows in the Ganga river network below the Himalayan Upper Ganga Region, especially in the dry seas on. Further anthropogenic uses must be immediately curtailed in critical su b-basins, and corrective measures applied where possible. The model simulation resul ts were also analysed in furt her detail to compare the average hydrographs of maximum 10-daily flows, avera ge 10- daily flows and minimum 10-daily flows under virgin and present conditions, respectively in the major sub-basins. Appendix 1 presents figures showing the comparative changes, and their significa nce is self-evident from the figures. 77 | P a g e Figure 5.3.8: Line Diagram of Ganga River N etwork (with major dams/ b arrages, canals, and flow and water quality measuring stations). 78 | P a g e Figure 5.3.9: Annual Flow Contributio ns of Different Tributaries (sub-basins) to National River Ganga under Present Flow Conditions and under Virgin Flow Conditions Figure 5.3.10: Wet Se ason Flow Contributions of Different Tributaries (sub- basins) to National River Ganga under Present Flow Conditions and under Virgin Flow Conditions 79 | P a g e Figure 5.3.11: Dry Sea son F low Contr ibutions of D ifferent Tributaries (sub-basins) to National River Ganga under Present Flow Conditions and under Virgin Flow Conditions 3. Sedim ent Re sources of Nat ional River Ganga Water-borne sediments play a vital role in the dynamics and ecology of the Gan ga River Network. The river's suspended sediment load - generally esti mated at between 500 to 800 million T/yr (e.g. 524 million T/yr vide Tandon et million T/yr vide Abbas & Subr amanian, 1984) - is probably the third highest among the world's rivers, after t he Yellow and Ama zon rivers' loads [Milliman & Meade, 1 983; Singh et al., 2003]. The total se diment load estimated at 2400 million T/yr [IITC, 2012] is also very high for any river, but since bed load measurements are few in the river network, the figure is very uncertain. Wasson [2003] reasoned that the long-term average of total sediment load of the combined Ganga-Brahmaputra rivers is between 1600 to 3 500 million T/yr, which suggests that the total sediment load of National River Ganga could be much less than 2400 million T/yr. Nonetheless, the sediment load is exceptionally high, and it evidently plays a key role in maintaining the network of rivers in dynamic equilibrium from t heir sources to the delta. Apart f rom t heir geomorphological significance, river se diments deposited on plains during floods replenish soils lost from the plains through erosion. Besides, sediments are also a potentially major s ource of key nutrient elements such as phosphorous as well as most of the micro- nutrient elements discussed in Section 4.1. These elements provide long-term fertility to the rivers and the delta (for maintaining healthy biota) as well as to the plains by flood deposits [Dixit et al., 2008]. The possibility of heavy metals being present in harmful proportions in the sediments has also been studied in the field, but their concentrations in sediments from upland sources are generally found to be benign in t he Gan ga river network [Jha et al., 1988; Purushothaman & Chakrapani, 2007; Singh et al., 2003]. In fact, consid ering the sediment load at 744 million tons/ year, 80 | P a g e Singh et al.'s [2003] estimate includes significa nt annual tra nsport of many sedimentary micro-nutrients to the Bay of Bengal (e.g. 1.3 X 106 tons Mn, 30.0 X 106 tons Fe, 110 X 103 tons Cr, 14 X 103 tons Co, 35 X 103 tons Ni, 41 X 103 tons Cu, and 78 X 103 tons Zn). Given t he known deficiency of many of these micro-nutrients in agricultural soils in NRGB (vide Mission Report on Sustainable Agriculture), the sediments deposited on flood plains would be a natural mechanism to replenish such nutrients. Wasson [2003] conducted a sediment budget analysis and estimated that most of the long-term sediment load in the Ganga river system derives from the Himalaya mountain range (especially from the High Himalay as), w ith probably less than 10% coming from the Siwaliks, plains and peninsular regions of the basin, vide Figure 5.12. While the exact figures may be uncertain, the Himalayas - on account of their litho-tectonic characteristics - undoubtedly contri bute the major sediment load in the river network. Thus many of the Himalay an tributaries of National River Ganga (such as the Kosi, Ghaghra, and Gandak) are k nown to carry enormous sediment loads, some of which tend to deposit on the plains during floods. T he Himalayan ranges are therefore important not only for the hydrological regime, but also for the geomorphological stability and fertility of the basin. Figure 5.3.12: A Sediment Budget (in 106 ton/yr) for Ganga Rivver Basin [from Wasson, 2003] In view of the above available inf ormation, it is first and foremost necessary to esti mate the correct sediment loads in the Ganga River System. To this end, river discharges and susp ended sediment concentrations measured continually at 13 measuring stations along the main stem of the National River Ganga for varying periods were availed from CWC. The said measuring stations and the period of sediment data availability are given in Table 5.3.4 below. Data were also available for 3 measuring stations on tributaries, but these have not been used here since such stations are too few. Based on data of the preceding 13 stations, t he avera ge sediment loads at different stations for the common period of data 81 | P a g e availability (1999-2006) were computed for annual, wet season and dry season sediment loads respectively, and are shown in Figures 5.3.13, 5.3.14 and 5.3.15. However, it may be noted that at Garhmuketswar data were availab le only up to 2003, so the average of the 1999-2003 period was used for this station. For further refere nce, the annual sediment load data for different stations are shown in the Appendix 2. Table 5.3.4: Sedime nt Measuring Statio ns and Per iods of Data Availability Station N o. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Station Na me Garhmukteshwar Station N o. 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Station Name Allahabad the Annual Average Sediment Loads (for period 1999-2006) at D ifferent Locations of National River Ganga 82 | P a g e Figure 5.3.14: Comp arison of the Average Wet Season Sediment Loads (for period 1999-2006) at Different Locatio ns of National Riv er Ganga Figure 5.3.15: Comp arison of the Average Dry Season Sedi ment Loads (for period 1999-2006) at Different Locations of National Riv er Ganga 83 | P a g e Overall, it may be noted t hat the common period of data availability is very limite d, hence the computed resul ts are of limited significa nce. But some provisional conclusions can be drawn from the figures. Firstly, the average suspended sediment load at Farakka (i.e. passing the Farakka Barrage in to the Gan ga/ Padma river as well as flowing into the canal feeding River Bhagirat hi/Hooghly) during the period 1999-2006 is only about 177 million T/y ear which is much less t han values between 500 to 800 million T/year commonly cited in literature. But, in consonance with obser vations cited in literat ure, most of the sediment load carried by the river occurs during the wet seas on. Secondly, the sediment load variati on along t he main river stem is somewhat intrigui ng, and they suggest varying agg rading-degrading stretches along the length of the river. Generally the load increases downstream, but it jumps shar ply between Ga rhmukteswar and Ka chlabridge (despite the Lower Ganga Canal taking off in this zone) and drops at Fatehgarh, suggesting a degrading river stretch before Ka chlabridge and an aggra ding stretch after it. Between Kan pur and Varanasi, the river stretch again a ppears to aggra de to some ext ent with the sediment load reducing downstream (despite the Yamuna river joini ng below Allahabad). After Varanasi, the sediment load increases steeply at Buxar (probably due to significa nt sediment inflows from the Tons and Gomti rivers) and in creases progressively up to Hathidah (with major tri butaries like Ghaghra, Sone, Gandak and Punpun joining National River Gan ga). But the sediment load decreases before Azimabad (except in the dry season), again suggesting channel aggra dation in this zone. Finally there is some further increase in load at Farakka (presumably with sediment inputs from River Kosi.) It may be also seen that most of the sediment outfl ow from Fa rakka barrage carries over to the Ganga/Padma river, with only a very small f raction entering the feeder canal of t he Bhagirat hi-Hooghly river. In summing up, the above discussions throw up many questions regarding National River Ganga's sediment resources. At the minimum, they underscore t he need for long-term monitor ing of sediment loads in the Ganga river system in cluding all her major tributaries, sediment budget assessm ents of her major su b-basins, understanding the dynamics of sediment flow in t he network, and sediment quality est imates. 4. Flow Discharges The South Asian monsoon system largely defines the climate and hydrology of the Ganga River. The monsoon brings heavy rains three months a year therefore, the Ganga River is characterised by high flows during the monsoon season, approximately from July until October, a nd low flows durin g the rest of the year. April and May are in general, the lowest flow months with negligible rainfall and a low base flow into the system. Due to the climate variability the timing of the onset of the monsoon period is uncertain. Climate change predictions suggest that for the River Ganga the monsoon discharges will increase in the future (ref). Figure 5.3.16 and Figure 5.3.17 show the rapid increase and fall of discharges during July and September -October at two locations: Varanasi (chainage 1311) and Far akka (chainage 583). The average values during the low flow season can be of the order of 1 per cent of the discharge during the high flow season. 84 | P a g e Figure 5.3.16: Average of maximum and minimum monthly discharges at Varanasi (chainage 1311) 85 | P a g e Figure 5.3.17: Mean, maximum and minimum monthly discharges at Farakka, chainage 583 (extracted from Jeuland et al, 2013) Maximum and minimum discharges were provided by IWAI for different years at 3 monthly discharges for a range of years were provided at Buxar (chainage 1124) and Patna (c hainage 955). When comparing this information it is clear (see Figure 5.3.18) that average discharges increase downstream during the high season (July to November). Figure 5.3.18: Monthly average discharges over the year at Allahabad, Varanasi and Patna In addition to the significant seasonal variation within years, there is also a great variability between years. With the tim e series available at the three upstream gauging sections it is possible to perform a statistical analysis of the lowest flows. Figure 5.3.19 shows, as an example, the extreme analysis performed at Allahabad considering the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) d istribution. 86 | P a g e Figure 5.3.19: Extremes analysis on the annual minimum flow at Allahabad The results of the statistical analysis are summarised in the following Table 5.3.5. 87 | P a g e Table 5.3.5: Annual minimum discharges obtained from statistical analysis Discharge (m3/s) Parameter Allahabad Mirzapur Varanasi Minimum recorded flow (m3/s) 96 122 117 1 in 2 year mini mum flow (50% annu al probability) 188 167 185 1 in 10 year mini mum flow (10% annu al probability) 117 128 130 1 in 100 year minimum flow (1% annual probability) 90 119 110 Despite data constraint at Buxar & Patna, the available data shows that the lowest flow recorded at Buxar was 225 m3/s and th e lowest flow recorded at Patna was 689 m3/s. These flows are considerably lower than the averages for the dry season. The report \"Status on River Ganga: State of the Environment and Water Quality\" from the National River Conservation Directora te (2009) provides useful information in terms of understanding water discharges along the upstream reaches of NW -1. The report presents water discharges with a probability of exceedance of 50%, 10% and Azamabad during the low flow season. It also presents average post -monsoon flows (in October -November), average flows in December -February and in March -May periods. These values are summarised in Table 5.3.5. They are generally higher than the values presented in Table 5.3.6 obtained from the statistical (extremes) analysis of available data at the three gauging stations.

Th e design discharge for this channel is around 1,100 m3/s. The navigation lock at Farakka, as well as the Feeder Canal, are part of the Farakka Barrage Project and become t he link between the Bhagirathi -Hugli system and the main River Ganga upstream of the Farakka Barrage. The existing agreement between India and Bangladesh, includes specific water allocation rules during the low flow season. The treaty establishes that during the period January - May 35,000 cusecs (or approximately 425 m3/s) are shared al ternatively through the Farakka Barrage on a 10 day cycle in each month by both countries. Data extracted from Jeuland et al (2013) shows the historical flows at Farakka for the period 1969 -2001 ( Figure 5.3.20).

Water Levels 89 | P a g e Temporal series of water levels have been provided for a number of locations along the waterway between Allahabad and Farakka . The following figures show the variability of monthly water levels, which can be of the order of 10 m during the high season. In general, water levels are at their high est in August -September and sharply decrease in October -November. In general, they continue to decrease during the whole low flow s eason, from December to May, and start to raise again in June -July. The variability of water levels during the dry season is lower than during the high season, with variations of the order of 2 -3m. The following figures show the maximum and minimum monthly values with the black block representing where 50% of the values concentrate. The period of the year in which the minimum water level can occur varies with location along the river. In the upstream reach es from Allahabad to Ghazipur the minimum water le vels occur from April to July ( Figure 5.3.21 and Figure 5.3.22). Downstream of the three major tributaries, Ghagra, Son and Gandak that join the river near Patna, the minimum water levels can occur between February and June as a result of the in fluence of snow melt (Figure 5.3.23 and Figure 5.3.24). Figure 5.3.21: Monthly water levels at Allahabad (chainage 1,547) Figure 5.3.22: Monthly water levels at Ghazipur (chainage 1,178) 90 | P a g e Figure 5.3.23: Monthly water levels at Hathida (chainage 850) Figure 5.3.24: Monthly water levels at Kahalgaon (chainage 690) Statistical analysis has been performed on the annual minimum and maximum water levels at 7 gauging stations between Allahaba d and Farakka. These water levels at each location are given for 3 annual probabilities of occurrence (see Table 5.3.7 and Table 5 .3.8). Table 5.3.7: Minimum water levels for a range of annual probabilities Location Minimum water level (m) Maximum water levels for a range of annual probabilities Location Maximum water level (m) 50% 10% 1% Allahabad 82.36 85.67 of LAD Least Available Data (LAD) available from Tribeni to Allahabad was analysed to get an understanding of the variations of water depths in NW -1. Data for the period April 2002 to June 2015 was used to build probability curves of LAD. As an example, two of them are shown in Figure 5.3.25. The curves show t he probability of having a LAD value lower than the value shown in the graph. For example, in IWAI Reach 20 the probability o f having a value less than 6.30 m in August is 90% and the probability of having a value less than 3.60 m is only 10%. As a ref erence, horizontal lines at 3, 2.5 and 2.2 metres are also shown on the Figures. The graph corresponding to the IWAI Reach 32, Varanasi - Chunar, clearly shows that, based on the existing data, the probability of having depths less than 2.2 m for the period Ja nuary -May and November -December is 90% or more. Figure 5.3.25: Probability curves of LAD for two different reaches 92 | P a g e This statistical information has also been analysed to show the periods when available water depths have a 50% probability to be lower tha n a certain value (3m, 2.5m and 2.2m). The information is presented in Table 5.3.9 below. It should be analysed in conjunction with other information presented in this report about the length and number of shoals to provide a full picture of the sedimentat ion processes occurring.

Ganga River System: Sources of Pollutants Various types for waste generation in NRGB have been identified in Figure 5.4.1. Two broad ty pes of wastes generated in the NGRB, whose improper disposal adversely impact water quality of the Ganga system are, 1) solid wastes and 2) liq uid wastes. Solid w aste can be broadly classified as, 1) non-hazardous and 2) hazardous. Non-hazardous solid waste is generated mostly from domestic, commercial and agric ultural sources. Industrial activity may result in the generation of both non-hazardous a nd hazardous so lid waste. Figure 5.4.1: Various types for waste generation in NRGB Liquid waste is produced when pollutants are intentiona lly dissolved or susp ended in water f or transport a way from their point of generation. Such point sources of liquid wa ste generation are attributable to domestic, commercial and industrial activitie s. Thus all Class I, Class II, Class III 98 | P a g e towns and villages in the NRGB are point sources for liquid wa ste. Inaddition, the industries in NRGB including, sugar and distillery, pulp and paper, tannery, t extiles a nd others are also major point sources of liq uid waste. Liquid wa ste is also g enerated from non-point (i.e., distributed) sources. The accumu lation of gar bage and the widespread practice of open defection resul ts in the general accumulation of filth in the NRGB landmass. This is entrained in t he surface ru noff during rainy season and becomes a source f or non-point pollution in the NRGB. The agricultural sector is also a major source for non- point pollution in NRGB. Fertilizers and pesticides applied on agric ultural fields are leached into irrigation return flows or storm runoffs. 2. Ganga River System: Pollutant Ingr ess Pollutant ingress into the Ganga river system occurs in three ways, 1) by direct discharge of pollutants, 2) discharge of polluted surface runoff into rivers, and 3) seepage of polluted subsurface flows into river s. Direct discharge of pollutants into rivers oc cur due to, i) discharge of liquid wa stes generated from point sources into rivers, ii) dump ing of municipal and industrial solid waste, devoti onal offerings, animal carcasses, un- burned/partially burned human bodies, etc. into rivers, and iii) non-ritual bathing w ith the intention of cleaning body dirt, direct defecation, wa shing of clothes, washing of vehicles, washing/wallowing of animals, e tc. The origin of polluted non-point surface discharge into the Ganga river system are twofold, i) sur face runoff contai ning lea ched fertilizers a nd pesticides applied on agric ultural fields and ii) surface runoff contai ning entrained solid wa ste, i.e., garbage, industrial wa ste, human and animal feces, et c. Some portion of the liquid waste generated from both point and non-point sources described above infiltrat es into the subsurface a nd pollute the groundwater. Seepage of this polluted ground water also results in pollution of t he Ganga river system. 3. Ganga River System: Pollution Status Exami nation of Ganga water quality data in dicates that at Dev Prayag (conflu ence of rivers Bhagirat hi and Alaknanda) and furt her downstream, the fecal coliform numb ers in Ganga River are on an averag e, 100 times more than the levels acceptable for bathing (Figure 5.4.2 ). Downstream of large cities like Kan pur, the fecal coliform numb ers are 1000 times or more than acceptable level s. Fecal coliforms are bacteria normally found in human feces. Discharge o f, i) untreated/partially treated domestic sewage into the river, and ii) storm ru noff contaminated with human feces is mainly respo nsible for the high fecal coliform numb ers o bserve d. 99 | P a g e Figure 5.4.2: Variation in 5 year average Fecal Coliform at Various Locations along the Ganga River The organic loading, as indicated by the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) is also high in some places of the Ganga river system (Figure 3). High BOD levels may result in low dissolved o xygen (DO) concentrations in water, which is inj urious to the aquatic life in the rivers. The source of such pollution is mainly the point discharges of untreated/partially trea ted domestic sewage a nd industrial ef fluents into the rivers. The nutrient, i.e., nitrogen a nd phosphorus loading are also high in some places in the middle and lower reaches of the Ganga river system. High nutrient loading leads eutrophication of the river, i.e., excessive growth of algae and aquatic plants, leading to the choking of the river. A glaring exam ple of this can be seen at upstream of Okhla Barrage on river Yamuna in Delhi. The high nutrient loading is attributable to, i) point discharges of untreated/partially treated sewage and industrial effluents and ii) non-point loading of fertilizer, fe cal and solid waste resid ues through surface ru noff and seepage of g roundwater. A ballpark esti mation of pollutant load contri buted through sewage generation in Class I and Class II towns (assuming that all sewa ge gets collected) in various NRGB states and NRGB Sub Basins is presented in Thematic Reports prepared by Consortium of 7 IITs [IITC, 2 014a-k]. 100 | P a g e The issues of inorganic salt loading into the Ganga river sy stem is mainly due to discharge of industrial effluents. Su ch loading is particularly high near tannery clusters in the Kanp ur region. The data regar ding loading of other pollutants i.e., pesticides and heavy metals into the Ganga river system is scanty [IITC, 2011b]. However, prelimin ary estimates indicate that concentration of pesticides and heavy metals in Ganga river system is low in most locations [IITC, 2011b]. Finally, it is estimated that approximately 70 percent of the volumetric pollution load on the Gan ga river system is from domestic/commercial sources, i.e., from human urine/feces and solid waste. Major polluting industries along river Gan ga are pulp and paper, sugar and distillery, tannery, textiles, etc. together with agric ultural pollution contri bute the remaining 30 percent pollution load to the river.

Ground Water Use pattern Groundwater is the water present beneath Earth 's surface in soilpore spaces and in th e fractures of rock formations . It is stored in and moves slowly through geologic formations of soil, sand and rocks calle d aquifers. The major land use type around the NW -1 is agriculture. The NW -1 area has a vast reservoir of groundwater, replenished every year at a very high rate. The conjunctive use of groundwater for irrigation, even within the canal command areas, not o nly ensures steady supply to the cultivated fields on time but also helps reduce water logging and salinization due to consequent downward movement of sub surface moisture. The groundwater usage pattern in the states traversed by NW -1 is given in Table 5.4.1-. The extent of groundwater utilization for irrigation is highest in Uttar Pradesh (45.36 BCM per year), followed by West Bengal (10.84 BCM per year), Bihar (9.39 BCM per year) and Jharkhand (0.7 BCM per year).

Throughout the alluvial area of the NW -1, most of the urban water supp ly schemes are dependent upon groundwater resources. Similarly, a large number of industries also withdraw significant amounts of groundwater, especially from the easily accessible aquifers in the alluvial zone. State wise ground wa ter resources in NW -1 state is given in Table 5.4.2 . Table 5.4.2: State wise Ground water resources in NW -1 (2008) S.

The average emissions from IW T mode range from 25 gr CO 2/ton-km to 70 gr CO 2/ton-km. Whereas from road transport by truck it varies from 60 -120 gr CO 2/ton-km and in the case of rail mode it varies from 20 -80 gr CO 2/ton-km depending upon fuel use transport capacity etc. In the case of IWT the variations are due to fleet structure, age and engine of vessels, fuel use, market conditions etc. All these factors are associated with IWT system efficiency which can be planned and managed to make the IWT system more efficient. Besides, the impa cts of climate change are required to be managed depending upon the events occurring due to the changes in climate taking place. This type of mitigation management is known as Adoption need in IWT facilities. For example, as per World Bank report on impact s of changes in climate in India are concerned, the erratic behaviour of Indian monsoon has become a reality and is considered to be the major manifestation of climate change impacts in India. The frequency of droughts or short spells of heavy rainfall eve nts are now being experienced at much higher rate. It is pertinent to mention that agriculture productivity is life line of India. An abrupt change in the monsoon could precipitate a major crisis, triggering more frequent droughts as well as greater floo ding in large parts of India. Droughts are expected to be more frequent in some areas, especially in north -western India, Jharkhand, Orissa and Chhattisgarh. At 2.5\u00b0C warming, melting glaciers and the loss of snow cover over the Himalayas are expected to t hreaten the stability and reliability of northern India's primarily all glacier -fed rivers, particularly the Indus and the Brahmaputra. The Ganges will be less dependent on melt water due to high annual rainfall downstream during the monsoon season. As pe r WB reports downward trend of river flow of the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra rivers alone could significantly impact irrigation, affecting the amount of food that can be produced in their respective river basins thereby adversely impacting livelihoods o f millions of people (209 million in the Indus basin, 478 million in the Ganges basin, and 62 million in the Brahmaputra basin in the year 2005). The Indus and the Ganges -Brahmaputra - Meghna Basins are the major trans -boundary rivers, and the increasing dem and for water is already leading to tensions among countries over water sharing (World Bank). Impact of Shift of Freight Movement to IWT Mode on Rate of Emissions of GHG: GHG emissions will be generated in IWT mode during three stages, i.e. during transp ortation of material within the terminal site for loading and unloading of barges; during transportation of construction material for construction of navigational facilities (terminals & locks); during dredging and material transportation vide batges. GHG emissions during each of this stage is estimated and is given in sections below A. GHG emissions due to Transportation of Materials within Terminal Site The GHG emissions generated due to material transoportation within the terminal site is estimated by calculating the emission factors for GHG generation per tonne of cargo movement within the terminal site using the available data for three terminal sites (Sahibganj, Varanasi and Haldia). Details of emissions factor estimations for GHG emissions within termin al sites are given in Table 1 below. 128 | P a g e Table 1: Emission Factor Calculation for GHG Emissions within Terminal Sites Terminals Per year material handling (MMT) at Terminals in phase I Per year material handling (MT) at Terminals in phase I No. of trucks (15 MT) required to carry the material -2 way movement Distance to be travelled by trucks within terminal site for material transportation (km) Standard for CO2 emission by trucks post 2000 of 6000 cc engine capacity (g/km) Per Year GHG Emissions (Tone s) Per Year GHG Emissions (Kg) GHG emission (kg) 0.071221606 per above estimations, it is found that 0.071221606 kg of CO 2 will be generated while transportation of 1 MT of cargo. Using market survey data for cargo availability and projection data for IWT mode (with project scenari o) by HPC consultant, GHG emissions to be generated due to transportation of material within terminal site every year (2016 to 2045) are given in Table 2 below Table 2: GHG (CO2) emission generation within terminal due to material transportation Year Volume of Cargo to eb Trasported -IWT Mode (With Project Emissions (Tonnes) 13760.9 B. GHG Emission Generation Due to Dredging It is anticipated that annual dredging of 14850000 cum will requ ired to be carried out for the project to maintain desired LAD in different stretches of NW -1. Type of dredgers to be used for the project will be Cutter Suction Dredgers. Specifications were available for CSD of Make \"Qingzhou Xianke Mechanical Device Co. , Ltd.\" & Model No. CSD -1. Taking reference of specification of this CSD, estimations are made how much fuel will be consumed for dredging 14850000 cum of sand from river. Details of specifications used and estimations made are given in Table 3 below: Table 3: Specifications of CSD (CSD -1) and Estimation of Fuel Consumption For Dredging Specifications of CSD (CSD -1) Used for Estimations Model CSD CSD -1 & Qingzhou Xianke Mechanical Device Co., Ltd. Dredging Capacity 700 cum/hr at full capacity Power rating 280 KW Fuel Consumption 200g/KW Estimations for Fuel Consumption Dredging Quantity/Year for project 14850000 cum As per above specification, CSD of power rating 280 KW dredging capacity 700 cum of sand per hour at full capacity (it mea ns at 280 KW 700 cum of sand can be dredged per hour) Power Requirement for Dredging 14850000 cum of sand 14850000/700 *280 =21214.28*280 = 5939999.9 KW 130 | P a g e Fuel Consumption for operating 5939999.9 KW =5939999.9 X 200 = 1187999999.999 g of fuel =1187999.9 k g of fuel As per IPCC default emission factors for European Ships and boats on Inland Waterways, Diesel Engine will generate 3140 g of CO 2 per kg of fuel consumed. It is assumed similar emissions will be made by diesel operated dredgers. Thus using this s tandard, CO 2 emission generation was estimated and are given below Fuel Consumption (Table 4) = 1187999.9 kg for dredging 14850000 cum of sand as required for project annually. CO 2 emissions will be = 1187999.9 X 3140 = 3730319686 g = 3730.3 Tonnes/Year These emissions will remain same throughout project cycle as dredging quantity will remain more or less same every year as per assumptions. C. GHG Emission Generation Due to Construction of Navigational Infrastructure Broad estimates are taken from HOWE for re quirement of construction material for construction of navigation infrastructure like terminals and jetties. Emission generation due to transportation of construction material for constructon of 6 nos of terminals and 1 no. lock is considered for estimatio n of GHGs. Construction of the terminals and lock is anticipated to occur between 2016 and 2017. Emissions estimated to be generated due to construction material transportation for 6 terminals and locks is given below in Table 4 below. Table 4: Emissions e stimated to be generated due to construction material transportation for 6 terminals and locks Facility Emissions (Tonnes) Year Varanasi terminal 650 2016 Sahibganj terminal 58 2016 Haldia Terminal 2982 2016 Other three 3600 2017 Farakka Loc k 2132 2017 D. GHG Emission Due to Material Transportation Vide Barges (IWT Mode) GHG emission generations for transportation of material by barges are also evaluated for material transportation vide barges (IWT Mode). It is well established that the GHG emission generation while bulk transportation of material is far less by IWT Mode if compared to Road & Rail due to minimal consumption of fuel in IWT mode. Thus it can be said that if the freight bulk movement is shifted from road/rail to IWT mod e (with project scenario), GHG emission generation due to material transportation will be comparatively lesser than other modes, i.e. Rail & Road (Without project Scenario). Estimations of GHG emissions is made for both the project scenario for all the thr ee modes i.e. road, rail & IWT. These estimations will not only help to evaluate the GHG generation due to material transportation vide barges but also will help us to know how much difference in GHG generation will be there in With project scenario. 131 | P a g e For the comparative assessment cargo availability and Traffic Data (actual and projected) collected & generated by HPC consultant is used. GHG emissions were evaluated for all the three modes for actual and projected cargo & traffic data using the GHG emission s factor available for all the three modes (Road -0.00016 t/km, Rail -0.000029t/km & IWT -0.000031 t/km) and are given in Table 5 below. On comparing emissions of both the scenario (with & without project scenario), it is found that the GHG emissions are less er in case of with project scenario which was already anticpated. Then GHG savings are also evaluated for the project (GHG emissions in Without Project Scenario -GHG emissions in with project scenario) and are also presented in Table 5 below. GHG savings es timated due to freight shift to IWT mode is 4875602 Tonnes. GHG Emissions Generation Due to movement of Empty Barges The barges carrying material may not always get the cargo while returning back or may not be loaded fully to the ultimate capacity. As per the current traffic data and projections made for different OD pairs, estimations are made to calculate the trips between the different ODs in which ship will return back in partially or totally unloaded conditions even if it is taking load intermitantly. It is also assumed that vessel will return more empty in the initial years which will reduce once movement and transportation with IWT increases in later years @ 1% less every year till 2045 (means about 50% empty return in 2016 to 21% empty return in 204 5) . Emissions will also be generated due to the empty vessel movement which is also not accounted in GHG savings calculated above in Table 5. Emission generation due to movement of empty barges is given in Table 6 below. It is estimated that in empty cond itions barges will carry some ballast water to maintain the balance. This ballast water volume is estimated to be 15% of the volume loaded and the emissions are calculated at 15% of net volume transport capacity of barges. Net GHG Savings Net savings will be equal to the GHG savings estimated due to shift of freight movement to IWT mode minus GHG emission generation due to movement of material within terminals, emission due to dredging operations, emissions due to transportation of construction material and emissions due to movement of empty barges. These calculations are given in Table 7 below. Net GHG savings for entire project lifecycle is estimated to be 4544037.4 Tonnes. Current Data on cargo volume for all the three modes: rail, road & IWT along with the growth rates and projections are taken from Feasibility Study carried out by HPC consultant. For reference purpose current data on volume of cargo (tones & tkm) & growth factors are given in Table 8 below and Cargo Projection Data (tkm) from 2015 -2045 is given in Table 9 below. 132 | P a g e Table 5: GHG Emissions Generation Due to Material transportation Vide Rail, Road & Barges During With project & Without project Scenario and GHG Savings Estimations Year GHG Emissions Without Project (tonnes) GHG Emissions With Project (tonnes) GHG Savings (tonnes) (Without Project -With Project) Road Rail IWT Road Rail IWT tonnes Table 6: GHG Emissions Due to Empty Barge Movement Year GHG Emissions 2016 6,857.58 Savings for the Project S.

Ho wever, vessels emit least air emissions compared to the road and railway modes. The impact on air quality due to vessel movement is anticipated insignificant considering the emission levels and projected vessel traffic. However, estimation is carried out to arrive at the total emission load from the movement of vessels and corresponding load for transportation of similar amount of cargo by rail and road. Emissions are calculated for transportation of cargo for entire project cycle through NW -1 between Hald ia to Varanasi and detailed calculations . Emission factors considered for various transportation mode are given in Table 1 below. Emissions savings for all the pollutants is given in Table 1.2. The analysis indicated that the emissions will be reduced over all due to modal shift and will have positive impact on micro climate. Traffic projections and emission generations estimations are given in Table 3-9.
