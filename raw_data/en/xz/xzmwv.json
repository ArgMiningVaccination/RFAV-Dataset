That's right - I gave myself a Kion Coffee enema. And I gotta tell you: not only did I feel \"clean as a whistle\" afterwards, but my energy levels were so intense and amazing for the rest of that day that I've given myself nearly a dozen coffee enemas since then. C'mon, I know you're colon is just quivering with curiosity now, right? Let's delve in into everything you've always wanted to know about coffee enemas (but were afraid to ask). \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 What Is A Coffee Enema? A coffee enema is an ancient herbal and folklore hydrotherapy procedure in which you fill an [enema bag or bucket](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009PK5600/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009PK5600&linkCode=as2&tag=bengree-20) with a mix of water and coffee, then feed this mixture into your colon via a tube, hold it inside for about 15 to 30 minutes, then expel it into the toilet. Sounds easy enough, eh? But coffee enemas aren't exactly some new underground biohacking method. The coffee bean and coffee plant have been part of herbal medicine, folk medicine and shamanic healing for thousands of years. One colorful description of an enema is found in the Dead Sea scrolls: \"...seek, therefore, a large trailing gourd, having a stalk the length of a man; take out its inwards and fill it with water from the river which the sun has warmed. Hang it upon the branch of a tree, and kneel upon the ground before the angel of water, and suffer the end of the stalk of the trailing gourd to enter your hinder parts, that the water may flow through all your bowels. Afterwards rest kneeling on the ground before the angel of water and pray to the living God that he will forgive you all your past sins, and pray the angel of water that he will free your body from every uncleanness and disease. Then let the water run out from your body, that it may carry away from within it all the unclean and evil-smelling things of Satan.\" While \"Evil-Smelling Things Of Satan\" may accurately describe some of your bathroom episodes, please take heart, for I will be giving you a far more pleasant version of a coffee enema than \"suffering the end of the stalk of a trailing gourd to enter your hinder parts\". I think gourds are best left as perhaps a table decoration for a nice Thanksgiving day dinner, and not as something to jam into your backside. Anyways, until about 1984, coffee enema procedures were listed in the [Merck Manual](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0911910190/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0911910190&linkCode=as2&tag=bengree-20) - a handbook by physicians the world over, and Dr. Lawrence Wilson probably has the most extensive (although a bit wordy) treatise on coffee enemas that I've ever seen in his article \" [Coffee Enemas]()\". \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Why On Earth Would You Want To Do A Coffee Enema? You're surrounded by toxins and pollution. Take metals for example. As I discuss in my [metal detox episode with Dr. David Minkoff](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2012/12/heavy-metal-natural-detox/), the current environmental levels of toxic compounds like lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, aluminum nickel, uranium, beryllium, bismuth, antimony, zirconium, gadolinium, and tin are through the roof. In addition, the laws of most nations permit the addition of over 3000 chemicals in our food, including pesticides, herbicides and over 100,000 other toxic chemicals. Prescription and over-the-counter drugs add over a thousand more toxic chemicals to our bodies, and the use of recreational drugs like cigarettes, second-hand cigarette smoke, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamines and cadmium-laden marijuana add even more toxicity to your already-burdened body. Now I know that you, as an astute reader of BenGreenfieldFitness, are probably not walking around with a Marlboro hanging out of your mouth and a baggie of Ecstasy in your back pocket, but you still get exposed to the effects of other people using these compounds in the air you're breathing and the water you're drinking. And these drug residues can remain in your body for decades. So the main reason for using a coffee enema would be to remove toxins from the body. In addition, coffee enemas can: -Clean and heal the colon... -Detoxify the liver... -Reduce many types of chronic pain... -Help eliminate many parasites... -Help with depression, confusion, and general tension... -Increase mental clarity and energy levels, while reducing moodiness or anger... -And much more... ...as a matter of fact, in my research on enemas, I've discovered 17 different reasons that you may want to consider doing a coffee enema (many of these are expounded on in [Dr. Wilson's Coffee Enema article](http://www.drlwilson.com/articles/COFFEE%20ENEMA.HTM)). 1. Astringent action. Astringency is an herbal property that refers to peeling the top layer of skin or mucous membrane. This is helpful for colonic healing, as the top layer of skin or mucous membrane is often ready to come off anyway, and can be loaded with toxins. So an enema is like cleaning the surface layer of the mucous membrane of the colon and perhaps the liver, as well. 2. Mechanical cleansing. An enema mechanically washes out the colon, removing toxic substances, and often parasites, bacteria, yeast colonies, and other debris. Enemas also stimulate the colon slightly by dilating it, and by altering its temperature, either making it a little hotter or a little colder. Another mechanical effect is to increase peristalsis and cause the colon to become active, emptying its contents more completely. Repeated enemas can help remove impacted feces and food residues, which is common (certain foods like white, refined flour can turn hard in the colon and stick to its walls). Repeat enemas may also help clean out 'pockets' or diverticuli in the colon, which are slight expansions or dilations in the wall of the colon of most adults that trap food particles, bacteria and often harbor parasitic organisms such as worms, yeasts and others. 3. Antioxidant effects. Singlet oxygen atoms cause oxidation in the body tissues. An example of oxidation occurs when you take a bite from an apple and the surface turns brown. This also occurs inside your bodies and is very damaging. Coffee contains antioxidant chemicals that prevent oxidation. These are particularly helpful for the liver, which is highly susceptible to oxidant damage. Unlike other antioxidants such as vitamin C, alpha lipoic acid and vitamin E, the antioxidants in coffee are far more \"yang\" in Chinese medical terminology. This is a great advantage because stressed bodies are already too yin and adding an excess of yin antioxidants can make the problem much worse. 4. Increased pH or alkalinity of the entire intestinal tract. This is likely due to enhanced bile flow. Increasing the alkalinity of the small intestine makes it much less hospitable for parasites. It also helps destroy many other types of infections in the small and large intestines. This can help improve the quality of the flora of the intestines and reduce dysbiosis or improper bugs in the intestines. 5. Palmitic acids. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, researchers in the lab of Lee Wattenberg identified salts of palmitic acids (kahweol and cafestol palmitate) coffee. These act as potent enhancers of glutathione S-transferase which is an important enzyme in the liver. Glutathione S-transferase is part of a major detoxification system that catalyzes the binding of many toxins from the bloodstream to the sulfhydryl group of glutathione. Adding coffee beans to the diets of mice enhanced glutathione S-transferase 600% in the liver and 700% in the small bowel! Dr. Max Gerson, MD, a major proponent of the use of coffee enemas, writes that: \"Heubner and Meyer of Goettingen University, Germany had shown in animal models that rectal administration of caffeine would dilate bile ducts and promote bile flow. Theophylline and theobromine, major constituents of coffee, dilate blood vessels and counter inflammation of the gut. The palmitates of coffee enhance glutathione S-transferase, which is responsible for the removal of many toxins from the blood. Finally, the water in the enema stimulates peristalsis or the movement of toxic substances from the duodenum or upper intestine, through the intestine, and out through the rectum.\" 6. Choleretic effects of caffeine. Caffeine is a mild central nervous stimulant, but not as toxic as most stimulants. Its effects include dilation of the bile ducts. Coffee enemas can cause dilation of bile ducts, which facilitates excretion of toxic cancer breakdown products by the liver and dialysis of toxic products from blood across the colonic wall. This property of caffeine, when administered rectally, is called a \"choleretic\". A choleretic is a substance that increases bile flow. While other agents classed as choleretics increase bile flow from the liver, most do little to enhance detoxifying enzyme systems, and they do not ensure the passage of bile from the intestines out the rectum. Bile is normally reabsorbed up to 9 or 10 times before working its way out the intestines in feces. The enzyme enhancing ability of the coffee enema is unique among choleretics. Because it does not allow as much reabsorption of toxic bile by the liver across the gut wall, it is a means of detoxifying the bloodstream through existing enzyme systems in the liver and small bowel. 7. Selenium and zinc. Coffee contains forms of selenium and zinc that are very well absorbed through the rectum. This is a primary reason for the enzymatic activity of coffee upon liver detoxification pathways. 8. Chinese Meridian effect. In acupuncture terms, coffee enemas enhance the liver meridian and balance the large intestine meridian. In the science of acupuncture, restoring health depends upon balancing about a dozen energy channels or meridians that run up and down the body. Introducing water and coffee into the colon weakens or inhibits the large intestine meridian. This tends to enhance the liver meridian, according to acupuncture theory. Commonly, the liver is weak and the large intestine meridian is overstimulated or overactive due to the presence of toxins in the large bowel. Even if it is not overactive, the effect of the coffee enema, in terms of acupuncture meridians, is to enhance the energy of the liver and gallbladder meridians. 9. Protection against toxins in coffee. This is probably one you don't need to worry about if you drink [Kion Coffee](https://getkion.com/coffee/), but coffee can contain some toxic metals such as lead, cadmium, and some toxic alkaloids. Also, some ground coffees may contain polyunsaturated oils that can quickly become rancid. However, when taken by the rectum, these toxins are not absorbed nearly as much as when the coffee is taken orally. This occurs because the colon is designed to absorb nutrients while filtering out and leaving behind toxic substances inside the colon. Coffee enemas are much, much different than drinking coffee. Your intestine has two circulatory systems. One system supplies your intestines with blood for maintenance of the intestinal tissues. The other system is called the portal system. It is a critical system that draws all of the absorbed nutrients from the intestines and sends them directly to the liver. So when you eat food or drink coffee, it does not (despite common belief) go straight into the bloodstream. Only a tiny part of it does, particularly the nutrients that are absorbed in the mouth, esophagus, and stomach. All the rest of the nutrients go into your portal system and then go to the liver, not to the general bloodstream. So the nutrients are processed by your liver before entering the bloodstream. But when coffee is introduced into your colon, it is absorbed directly into the liver through the colon wall. Coffee has a special affinity for the liver, and moving it there from the colon is very different than sending it to the liver by drinking it. When coffee is ingested by mouth, many of its herbal properties can be minimized. 10. Yang effect. Most people's bodies today are too yin, in Chinese medical terms, especially those who are old or sick. Yin means cold, expanded and today it also means ill. A problem with most medicines and natural remedies such as vitamins and herbs is that they make the body even more yin. In contrast, coffee is a more yang substance, even though it grows in tropical climates. It becomes much more yang when roasted thoroughly and boiled for 12-13 minutes only. This also gets rid of some of the caffeine, a yin substance (although some caffeine is necessary for the desired effects). The yang quality of coffee is a great advantage of this procedure over other herbal, natural and medical methods for cleansing the liver and colon. The yang effect is due to a combination of the nutritional factors in coffee, and its ability to remove yin toxins from the body such as toxic metals and toxic chemicals. 11. Sympathetic nervous system relaxation. Coffee enemas help relax the sympathetic or fight-or-flight nervous system. This may seem odd, since coffee contains caffeine, which is a stimulant. Possible reasons for relaxation of the sympathetic nervous system include: 1) stimulation of two important parasympathetic organs, the liver and the large intestine, 2) nutrients in the coffee, 3) removal of irritating toxins from the body rapidly and thoroughly, and 4) the relaxing downward motion of energy. 12. Improved hydration. While it may seem minor, this can be a major benefit of coffee enemas. Many people are dehydrated today. Common reasons for dehydration are 1) not drinking enough water, 2) drinking incorrect types of water such as reverse osmosis water, which does not hydrate the body well, and 3) ingesting substances that tend to dehydrate the body, such as sugars, processed sodium-rich packaged foods, caffeine and alcohol. The addition of several cups of water in the enema improves this situation. 13. Reduced autointoxication. Autointoxication is a word used to describe the production of toxins within the body, usually due to the action of bacteria and yeasts upon partially digested food. Most are the result of fermentation or rotting (putrefaction) - and a lot of it occurs in people's large intestines. This can cause gas, bloating and foul-smelling stools. By cleaning the colon of yeasts, parasites and other pathogenic organisms, and by increasing the bile flow, coffee enemas can reduce autointoxication. 14. Assisting the lymphatic system. Coffee enemas can assist lymphatic drainage which occurs in something called \"the Peyer's patches\". These are extremely important lymph glands located along certain areas of the small intestine. Although the coffee solution does not reach this far, the coffee enema may assist the Peyer's patches due to reflex effects. 15. Yeast and other parasite elimination from the colon. This is a great benefit for some people whose colons are full of yeast. For this to occur, you need to do several coffee enemas back to back, putting in a total of about 2 quarts of water into the colon. When you do this, it helps to rub the colon area of the abdomen vigorously to get the water to penetrate into the pockets of the colon to dislodge the yeast organisms. Adding some crushed garlic to the enema coffee-water mix may help this a little by a chemical mechanism. 16. Better skin. Your body must eliminate toxins somehow. If your colon is not working well, the body must use alternative elimination channels. One of these is the skin. This causes skin issues like dermatitis, acne, eczema, and psoriasis. Your skin must compensate for inadequate elimination through the liver and colon. Coffee enemas assist the skin by restoring elimination through the liver and colon. 17. Meditation A coffee enema is really a form of quiet discipline and an intense meditation and concentration exercise. This may seem odd, but just lying down and holding your anal sphincter closed for 15 to 30 minutes is a form of concentration exercise that teaches discipline, relaxation, coordination and other mental traits that are helpful. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Why Should You Use [Kion Coffee](https://getkion.com/coffee/) In Your Enema The last thing you want to do is inject toxic coffee up your butt, right? I'm often asked what coffee I actually use for my weekly coffee enema. Here's the way I think about it: if I'm going to be shooting coffee up my ass, I might as well be doing it with the cleanest, purest, highest anti-oxidant coffee I can get. Makes sense, right? You can use any regular, caffeinated, non-instant coffee for coffee enemas. But [Dr. Wilson](http://www.drlwilson.com/articles/COFFEE%20ENEMA.HTM) has some experienced suggestions from the trenches for the best coffee - and that influenced my decision to only use [Kion Coffee beans](https://getkion.com/coffee/) for my coffee enemas. 1. A medium or dark roast is best. Research in Molecular Nutrition & Food Research found that dark roast coffee restored blood levels of the antioxidants vitamin E and glutathione more effectively than light roast coffee. The dark roast also led to a significant body weight reduction in pre-obese volunteers, whereas the light roast did not. Other research shows that dark roast coffee produces more of a chemical called N-methylpyridinium. This chemical is produced during the roasting process, and the darker the roast, the more N-methylpyridinium it contains. Caffeine levels vary depending on the degree of roasting of the coffee. Darker roasts often contain less caffeine than lighter roasts. Some authorities suggest a light roast coffee, or golden coffee, which is often marketed \"enema coffee\". But this type of coffee is much more yin, which (as you learned earlier) is not a good thing. 2. Mold-free coffee is best. Most coffee beans are processed by either leaving them in the sun and elements to wither and dry, or by pressing them and letting them ferment (spoil) to remove the outer layer of the bean. Both of these techniques are known to produce significant levels of mycotoxins as they enhance flavor. Kion Coffee never contains mold. Ever. When searching for the freshest coffee possible, mold cannot be tolerated. 3. Organically grown coffee is best. Let's face it: you don't want pesticides in your colon...do you? But most commercial coffees often have pesticides on them [Kion Coffee](https://getkion.com/coffee/) is always organic. Less than 3% of coffee on the planet is certified organic. At Kion, we will never tolerate pesticide-soaked beans, or grow our coffee in fields that are doused with herbicides. We only choose the BEST coffees from the BEST organic, sustainable farms in the world, where we have a direct relationship with the farmer. The farms that grow Kion Coffee use production practices that are good for the planet, good for the coffee crop, and good for the people who grow the coffee, both economically and ecologically. So that's why I shoot only the best of the best coffees up my butt.... [Kion Coffee](https://getkion.com/coffee/) beans \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 What Is The Best Enema Equipment? It's pretty obvious that it's important that anything you're inserting into your rectum should be clean, right? I personally use this [Stainless Steel Enema Kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009PK5600/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009PK5600&linkCode=as2&tag=bengree-20), which consists of a clinically Hygienic Stainless Steel bucket, medical grade accessories and a clamp, and 10 extra latex-free sterilized tips. Why not an enema bag? Not only are buckets better than enema bags because of the plastics and potential for bacterial contamination in bags, but since buckets are open at the top they can be thoroughly cleaned (you just need to be careful during your enema not to spill the bucket, since it is open at the top). There are also enema bottles, which are inexpensive plastic bottles that have a removable top. These typically aren't for coffee enemas. They come filled with just salt water, and are designed for a single use enema to clean the colon, with none of the beneficial coffee effects. You could technically empty out the salt water and fill the bottle with coffee and use it for coffee enemas, but there's still the issue with the fact that you're risking leached plastics getting into your body. They also hold very little liquid (about 8 ounces) so you don't get much of a hydration or cleaning effect. There are also costly colonic irrigation machines (over $1000) and these are not usually used at home for coffee enemas. Some colon therapists and physicians, however, may have them available in their offices to administer a coffee enema for you. The advantage of the machine is that it uses a thicker enema tip that allows water to flow in and flow out. This means that when you do your enema, you do not have to go to the toilet to empty out the coffee. I'd personally rather just save a grand and take a dump afterwards. Honestly, it feels pretty good anyways. So in a nutshell, you pretty much just need this [enema kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009PK5600/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009PK5600&linkCode=as2&tag=bengree-20), some [Kion Coffee](https://getkion.com/coffee/), a bit of self-confidence with 30 minutes to spare. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 How Do You Do A Coffee Enema? Alright, it's time to get down to the nitty-gritty. Literally. Especially the gritty part. Heh. Step 1: Prepare your coffee So it turns out that there are many ways via which you could prep your coffee, including using a standard coffeemaker, using a percolator, using a steam flash method using a soak (or non-boil method) or doing the boil-for-13-minutes method. Since it seems most straightforward, I choose the boil-for-13-minutes method, but you can [read about the other methods here](http://www.drlwilson.com/articles/COFFEE%20ENEMA.HTM). The boil-for-13-minutes method goes like this: 1. Put about 1/3 of a cup of water in a saucepan (I used a cast-iron skillet, and lately have been using more water - up to a quart - but for starters stick to 1/3 cup). Preferably use distilled water or Ice Age glacial spring water, although any spring water or even a clean tap water will do. 2. Add about \u00bd to two tablespoons of [Kion Coffee](https://getkion.com/coffee/), and bring it to a boil. 3. When the water and coffee boils, turn down the burner and allow it to simmer for 13 minutes. Then turn off the burner, move the pan to a cool burner, and add about one full cup of water or a little more. Adding the room temperature water will cool down your coffee so it is the right temperature. To test the temperature of the water, place a finger in it. It should be a comfortably warm temperature. If the water is too hot or very cold, retaining the enema will be more difficult, and let's face it: nobody wants boiling hot water shot up their butt. Step 2: Put coffee into enema bucket First, remove the coffee grounds from the liquid, if needed. You don't want grounds in your enema, trust me. Two ways to remove the coffee grounds are decanting or filtrating. To decant, pour the coffee liquid slowly into the enema bucket, and the grounds should stay behind. Alternatively, you can strain the coffee liquid through a fine strainer or coffee filter paper into the bucket. Step 3: Get air out of the enema tube Don't worry, the [Stainless Steel Enema Kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009PK5600/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009PK5600&linkCode=as2&tag=bengree-20) I mentioned earlier comes with complete graphic instructions on how to make sure there's no fart-producing air in the tube, but basically you grasp, but do not close the clamp on the hose, you place the tip of the enema tube in the sink, you hold up the enema bucket slightly above the tip until the water begins to flow out, then as soon as it starts flowing, you quickly close the clamp. This expels any air in the tube. Step 4: Lube up, baby Lubricate the enema tip with a small amount of olive oil, [coconut oil](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/coconut-oil-amazon), Vaseline, love-making lube or any other handy slippery stuff you have around. (Note: Too much lubrication might cause the tip to fall out of the rectum, creating a mess. Experiment to see how much and what kind of lubrication is best for you). Step 5: Poop That's right - if possible, have a bowel movement before doing your enema. If you're constipated and that's the reason you're doing an enema, I realize you'll probably wait until after your enema. But if not, think about taking those 13 minutes during which the coffee is preparing, and take a dump. This can make it much easier to retain the enema. If you have difficulty having a bowel movement, you can: -relax and focus on deep, easy breathing -drink a glass of warm water -rub the right calf area while sitting on the toilet -rubbing and twisting the right pinky toe can cause a bowel movement. -take a shot of apple cider vinegar -take a scoop of [Vitamin C](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HXSRL4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005HXSRL4&linkCode=as2&tag=bengree-20%20http://goo.gl/X8Qj3M) mixed with a scoop [Magnesium powder](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/natural-calm) If none of these work, you can do a quick plain tap water enema to clean the colon before your coffee enema. Step 6: Let the fun begin I'd recommend you use the bathtub, and simply lie on your left side in the bathtub or on the bathroom floor (lay some towels down if you need a soft surface), with the enema bucket on the edge of the bathtub, the edge of the bathroom counter or sitting on a chair, stool or toilet beside the tub. With the clamp on the enema tube closed, insert the tip gently and slowly. Aim it straight upwards from the legs, not at any angle. If you're lying on your left side, keeping your left leg straight and bringing your right leg up towards your chest can help make the insertion easier. Twist or turn the enema tip gently as you insert it, as this can make it slide in much easier. Do this until it goes all the way in. The enema tip must go in at least two inches. Never leave it half way in - it will not work this way. There are two anal sphincters it must pass through, so the tip must be in this far. Step 7: Let the coffee go in Open the clamp. The coffee may take a few seconds to begin flowing. If it does not flow, you may gently squeeze the hose to get it to flow. If you develop a cramp as you are putting the coffee inside, close the hose clamp, turn from side to side and take a few deep breaths. The cramp will usually pass quickly. Step 8: Relax When all the coffee is inside you, you'll see the enema tube doesn't have coffee in it anymore. That's when you close the clamp. You can leave the enema tube inserted, or remove it slowly. If you have intestinal gas, definitely leave the enema tip inside of you and leave the clamp open. The gas will tend to flow out through the enema tip. Otherwise, you will not be able to hold the enema. You'll want to just lie there for 15-30 minutes. During this time you can: -Meditate. -Massage your lower abdomen (rubbing the colon area may help break up deposits of impacted feces or even colonies of yeasts or parasites). -Do [infrared lamp therapy](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/joovvlight/). While retaining your enema, you can shine a red heat lamp on your abdomen. If possible, set up the lamp so that it is about 2 feet away and shines down on your abdomen or chest. - [Listen to your favorite podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ben-greenfield-fitness/id283908977?mt=2). -Keep your fingers crossed that your house does not catch on fire. -Think about how much money you are saving by not buying a latte at Starbucks. Step 9: Finish up After 15 to 30 minutes (I go 30 minutes) or a little longer, go to the toilet and empty out the coffee. Yes, just poop it out. It comes out much, much easier than you'd think. Then wash the enema bucket, the tube and the tip thoroughly with soap and water, and leave them out to dry or hand-dry them with a towel or paper towel. Boom. Done. Clean. And by the way, it feels freaking amazing afterwards. Like you're \"squeaky clean\" down there. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 How Often Should You Do An Enema? For an intensive detox protocol, you can do an enema at daily, and up to about four times each day. I've been doing one every two weeks, usually when I get back from a bunch of travel, or I've been stressed out, or I'm low on sleep, or I'm constipated. And coffee enemas can indeed be something that you do as a lifelong protocol. Based on the amazing way that I feel afterwards, I probably will do just that. Some health authorities warn that coffee enemas cause dependency and can damage the intestinal flora. But I've seen zero evidence of negative effects from them if they are done properly, and if you avoid doing something dumb like shoving a dirty tube into your backside or doing 10 coffee enemas over the span of a couple days you should be fine. And of course, don't use toxic coffee. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 What Are Some Ways To Detox or Fix Constipation If You Don't Want An Enema? Yes, yes, I do realize that a coffee enema may not be for everyone. Perhaps it's even illegal in your country. You may want to check the laws (I'm kidding...I think). Anyways, inside the [BenGreenfieldFitness Inner Circle](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/innercircle), I have full instructions for both a 7 day and also a 30 day cleansing protocol. Neither of these protocols require enemas, although you could technically do enemas as part of the protocols. But here are some other quick tips for you. One extremely potent cleansing Ayurvedic herb that I've recently discovered is called \" [Triphala](http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=triphala&linkCode=ur2&tag=bengree-20&url=search-alias%3Daps)\". You can read about it in more detail in this \" [Wonders of Triphala](http://www.planetherbs.com/specific-herbs/the-wonders-of-triphala.html)\" article, but it acts very similarly to a coffee enema in that it: - Improves digestion - Reduces serum cholesterol - Improves circulation (potentiates adrenergic function) - Contains 31% linoleic acid (excellent for weight loss) - Exerts a marked cardioprotective effect - Reduces high blood pressure - Improves liver function - Has proven anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties, Interestingly, [Triphala](http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=triphala&linkCode=ur2&tag=bengree-20&url=search-alias%3Daps) works well if it is combined with other chi, blood or yang-warming tonic Ayurvedic herbs such as ginseng for chi tonification, tang kuei for blood tonification and aconite for yang tonification. Since coffee enemas would also be considered \"yang\" inducing, [Triphala](http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=triphala&linkCode=ur2&tag=bengree-20&url=search-alias%3Daps) would be a good one to combine with your enema protocol. But wait, there's even more options for constipation and detoxification! In my podcast episode \" [How To Poop The Right Way](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2013/03/how-to-poop-the-right-way/)\", I mention: 1. [Colorectal Recovery Program](http://www.gutsense.org/store/colrectkit.html?AFFID=108112) - In the article I wrote about [how to limit the damage from antibiotics](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2011/07/the-art-of-using-antibiotics-how-to-limit-the-damage/), you learn how use of antibiotics can completely nuke the healthy bacterial terroir in your digestive tract. It turns out that in [my fight with MRSA last year](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2012/06/how-safe-are-you-from-this-creeping-killer-that-lives-in-gyms/), during which I was forced into a high antibiotic dosing regimen, I did some pretty good damage to the good bacteria in my colon - to the point where I could barely even fart because there was really no bacteria \"down there\". I was severely constipated for weeks and I searched desperately for a solution. With just 30 days of this [Colorectal Recovery Program](http://www.gutsense.org/store/colrectkit.html?AFFID=108112) (designed by Dr. Konstantin Monastyrsky, who wrote the [article about why too much fiber is bad](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2013/01/is-fiber-bad-for-you/)) I was right as rain. 2. [MagO7](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014H7GA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00014H7GA&linkCode=as2&tag=bengree-20) - This is a blend of elemental magnesium from ozonated magnesium oxides, mixed with elemental potassium. My [Drew Canole ](http://www.drewcanole.com/)told me about it, I [ordered some](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014H7GA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00014H7GA&linkCode=as2&tag=bengree-20), and it's turned out to be quite successful for a nice pooping experience. I've found it works for some people, and doesn't work for others, but for the folks who this this stuff works for, it has a potent stool softening effect when you take 4-5 capsules at night with a glass of water. 3. [CapraCleanse](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/mtcapra) - Even though I'm not a huge fan of the high amounts of fiber in [CapraCleanse](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/mtcapra), and hence do not use it on a daily basis ( [click here to see why I limit high fiber supplements](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2013/01/is-fiber-bad-for-you/)), this is the one supplement that I've found to make a big difference if I happen to be consuming moderately high amounts of alcohol - which typically happens to me in party situations about once every month or so. I just pop 3-4 before drinking and 3-4 after drinking, and it not only has a good liver cleansing effect, but also eliminates the inevitable constipation that can occur with high alcohol consumption ( [click here for more of my natural hangover cures](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2012/12/how-to-get-rid-of-a-hangover-as-fast-as-possible-with-the-best-natural-hangover-cures/)). Capracleanse is also good for constipation that can occur during airline travel. I go into greater detail on each of these fixes in the \" [How To Poop The Right Way](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2013/03/how-to-poop-the-right-way/)\" podcast episode with male model and pooping expert Troy Casey.
