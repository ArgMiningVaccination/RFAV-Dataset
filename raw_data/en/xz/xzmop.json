Vitamin C is necessary for our immune system to operate fully and facilitate healing. It is also a powerful antioxidant and protects your cells against the effects of free radicals. Free radicals are byproducts of toxins in the environment, smoking, and poor diet. They may cause cancer, heart disease, and other diseases. Vitamin C can prevent damage from free radicals and protect your body against disease. It can also help your body absorb and store iron. Because we cannot produce Vitamin C in our body, it is essential to eat foods high in Vitamin C, such as citrus fruits, berries, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and spinach. IV Vitamin C Therapy has been known to improve overall health and treat conditions such as: - Fatigue [Anxiety & Depression](https://healthandvitalitycenter.com/medical-conditions/anxiety-and-depression/) [Allergies](https://healthandvitalitycenter.com/medical-conditions/allergies/) [Brain Fog](https://healthandvitalitycenter.com/medical-conditions/brain-fog/) - Certain neurological diseases Why use Vitamin C IV instead of pills or supplements? Intravenous (IV) therapy is the most efficient way to absorb the treatment. Vitamin C pills taken orally can lead to gastrointestinal problems due to the effect of unabsorbed vitamin C in the gastrointestinal tract. With the IV, 90-100% of the dose is absorbed as opposed to 50% orally At the Health and Vitality Center in Los Angeles, Dr. Lalezar will obtain a complete history from you before deciding what is the best dosage of IV vitamin C to support your medical condition. Before starting high-dose Vitamin C therapy, the G6PD level is checked. G6PD is an enzyme necessary to process Vitamin C. If it's abnormal, patients won't be able to receive high-dose vitamin C because hemolytic anemia may occur.
