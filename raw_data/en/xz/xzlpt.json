You may even know that crystals can be a powerful tool in your meditation practice, but how do you begin? Let's explore why crystal meditation has recently become so popular, and all the benefits\u2014both aesthetic and spiritual\u2014of using crystals to boost and enhance meditation. Why Meditating with Crystals is Popular First of all, there is little study or evidence in western culture about [the effectiveness of using crystals in meditation](https://www.healthline.com/health/meditate-with-crystals). That said, people in many different cultures have used crystals as powerful tools for healing, wellness, and in meditation practice for many years. Some people believe that crystals have the power to heal, boost mood, and bring about a sense of connection to the earth and surroundings. Thousands of years ago, the [Ancient Sumerians used crystals](https://www.crystalage.com/crystal_information/crystal_history/) in their magic and healing rituals. Ancient Egyptians used many different jewels and gems, including crystals, within their rituals and lifestyles. They believed that specific stones brought about protection, health, and wellness. They included stones and crystals in many of the burial rituals. In the East, stones were used in many different ways. In Chinese culture, jade was revered and used for luck, protection, and healing. In many religions like Jainism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam, stones were included in many practices and rituals. Meditation originated in India and was practiced throughout the East in different forms. Meditation practices often [included crystals and precious stones](https://www.mahamala.com/bhakti-blog/this-is-india/healing-crystals-in-india/) to add beauty, increase luck, and remind users of their ancestry. Crystals and stones were used in ancient Greece, where [the word crystal originated as \"krystallos,\" meaning ice](https://news.stanford.edu/2018/08/09/understanding-peoples-obsession-crystals/). They believed that crystals came from water that had been frozen into a permanent form. Greek soldiers and sailors used gems and crystals to keep themselves safe in battle and at sea. Later in Renaissance Europe, crystals, stones, and gems were used for healing and as protection in battle. Some believed that certain gems could ward off evil spirits. During the Age of Enlightenment, people moved away from the idea that inanimate objects possessed certain qualities or abilities, and people stopped using crystals and gems in religious practices. They still assigned symbolic meaning to gems, however, and they were used by royalty to represent status and wealth. Gemstones have been used by Native Americans for many years, as well. Tribal cultures use certain stones in their spiritual practices. For example, turquoise is highly sacred to many Native American tribes. Aboriginal and Mori tribes also use stones in their healing and other practices. In the modern age, crystals and gemstones have come back into popularity in western culture, particularly in meditation practice. Many new-age spirituality practitioners believe crystals have certain vibrations and qualities that can aid in protection, focus, health, wellness, and more. Some people report experiencing certain feelings and even physical reactions when working with different crystals and gemstones. How Crystals & Meditation Can Affect Our Mood and Consciousness Because there's very little scientific study done on the use of crystals, it's hard to say if they really work to enhance our moods or meditation practice. Many users assume it's a positive \"placebo effect\" that aids in focus and self-soothing. Crystals have a tactile appeal\u2014they are often in interesting shapes. They can feel cool and smooth to the touch. They connect us to the earth and the history of the stone. When we use crystals in meditation practice, we may think about the formation of crystals over time, how long they've been part of the planet, and the natural world. Meditation is a powerful tool for calming our emotions, helping us [slow down and center ourselves](https://eupterra.com/be-less-busy), collecting our thoughts, and processing different energies. While there haven't been many studies on crystals, there have been many studies that show that meditation has many benefits. [Meditation helps us reduce our stress levels](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/meditation/in-depth/meditation/art-20045858).

If you have issues with anxiety and stress, I also suggest trying a product like [RestEZ Relaxation Herbal Supplement from Melaleuca](https://www.melaleuca.com/our-story?referralCode=charlenearountree). I find their products to be extremely reliable and effective for many issues. Using a focus tool like crystals to enhance your meditation practice can also be a good idea, especially if you're new to meditation or have a tough time feeling focused. Guided meditation apps, meditation videos on YouTube, and other free books and resources are also helpful in introducing you to the various types of meditation. Choose a crystal that feels right to you if you want to use crystals in your meditation practice. You can find crystals at new age shops, gem stores, and of course, online on sites like Etsy. It can be helpful to select a crystal in person, so you can choose based on the feelings you get from it. Some people who are very spiritually in-tune report that they feel a vibration from certain crystals. They may even see colors, experience tastes, or hear a humming noise when they handle certain stones. Don't feel bad if you don't experience this, especially if you're new to working with crystals. Instead, just pick the stone that you feel drawn to. Preparing to Meditate with Crystals If you've found a crystal that you'd like to incorporate into your meditation practice, it's helpful to do some preparation first. Many people like to \"charge\" or cleanse their crystals before using them. People feel that this resets their energy and helps release any negative vibes the crystals might carry. You can use salt water or pass the crystal over a candle or incense ( [particularly sage](https://eupterra.com/how-to-make-homemade-smudge-sticks)) to cleanse crystals. Some people like to chant or pray over their crystals or even bury them for a short time. To charge crystals, lay them out in moonlight or the sun, depending on what feels best to you. Keep in mind that some crystals are more delicate, so always research the cleansing method before carrying it out. Once your crystal is cleansed, you can use it within your meditation session. Some people like to set an intention or focus on the crystal. Others create certain rituals when they meditate, including putting the crystal in a certain spot, chanting over the crystal, or holding it in their hand. They may include it with other meditation rituals like the use of \"singing\" bowls, prayer beads, or lighting candles. Rituals themselves [can be helpful mental health tools](https://brainworldmagazine.com/cross-your-fingers-do-rituals-really-work/). Scientists have connected the power of ritual with positive sports psychology as well as grieving rituals and practices in many different cultures. When humans connect with a ritual, they often experience a boosted mood and improved confidence. This can help them perform better, heal, and return to a state of mental health. Once you've performed the ritual that feels right to you, you're ready to carry out your crystal meditation practice. You may want to hold the crystal or put it near you. If you're working with several crystals, try arranging them in a geometric pattern or \"crystal circle\" in front of you. Some people like to meditate in a bathtub with the crystal or [even place them on their bodies' chakras](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-are-chakras). Focus on your breath and allow yourself to relax, slowly entering a meditative state. Close your eyes, take deep breaths, and clear your thoughts. You may notice certain sensations or vibrations coming from the crystals in your mediation practice. Most practitioners recommend only working with meditation crystals for a short time and only about once per week. If you're new to crystals, you may want slowly incorporate crystals into your meditation sessions\u20145-10 minutes at first. If you feel uncomfortable at any time, pause the practice and move around. Hydrate and do some deep breathing. Store your crystals somewhere safe until the next time you use them. For example, you may want to place them on an altar or store them carefully in a box. Some people like to keep them with certain herbs or other sacred items.
