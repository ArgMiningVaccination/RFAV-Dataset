Children's needs are vastly different than grown-ups. We offer a variety of services geared specifically for our pediatric population. Primary Care Our [Nurse Practitioners (APRNs)]encourage yearly well-child check-ups, sport/camp physicals and offer parental guidance on topics from infant needs to young adult development. We focus on education and preventive care specific to your child. We offer traditional treatments and immunizations as well as holistic herbal remedies for kids. We do also see our fair share of sick visits! Bowenwork [Bowenwork]helps children perform better academically, excel in sports, improve social skills, and to be happier and more productive. Bowenwork assists with relaxation and recovery for many conditions such as structural misalignments, overuse injuries, stress, fatigue, ear/throat problems, insomnia, ADHD and developmental delays by promoting the body's process for self-healing. Chiropractic Chiropractic is as beneficial to kids as it is for adults and helps to endure spine health. Often times spinal issues adults experience start as children due to poor posture, playground accidents, or possibly even a traumatic childbirth. [Dr. Ryan Khalsa]treats kids with spinal issues, ear infections, poor posture, and has successfully treated motion sickness. Energy Medicine [Hilary Crowley]promotes healing through energy balance and body wisdom in a gentle setting. Hilary helps children and teens benefits from deep relaxation, less stress, clarity and an understanding of wellness. Health Intuition is not a substitute for medial care but can assist in identifying the root of an issue at the physical, chemical, emotional and spiritual level. It is an appropriate complement to both conventional and alternative care. Massage Therapy Massage for kids helps with relaxation and regulating sleep. This can be a big issue for adolescents having hormonal shifts, heavy school work loads, social stress, and a busy external environment. Massage improves circulation, focus, and helps with inflammation during post-operative care. Sessions can help postural alignment and reduce muscle tension for children playing sports or musical instruments. [Elisabeth Robinson, APRN]is certified in infant massage. This helps promote a stronger connection with your baby and enhances physical and emotional well- being.
