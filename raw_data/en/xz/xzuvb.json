This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. \u00a92020 dTERRA Holdings, LLC Alpha CRS+ PIP US 020921 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION dTERRA Alpha CRS+ Cellular Vitality Complex is a proprietary formula combining potent levels of natural botanical extracts that support healthy cell function with important metabolic factors of cellular energy.* Alpha CRS+ is formulated to be used daily with xEO Mega\u00ae or vEO Mega\u00ae and Microplex VMz\u00ae as a comprehensive dietary supplement foundation for a lifetime of vitality and wellness.* CONCEPT Cells are the basic building block of all life. Healthy tissues, organs, and, ultimately, healthy organisms depend on cellular reproduction and specialized function, energy production, and timely cell death when cells are not functioning at optimal levels. As we age, cellular function can deteriorate and we gradually begin to experience decreased energy and performance. Additionally, cellular stressors, including oxidative stress to cellular DNA and other key cell structures, challenge cellular heath. Providing cells with essential nutrients and metabolic factors of cellular energy and protecting our cells from toxic stressors supports healthy cell function, vitality, and wellness.* DNA and Cellular Function The human body is made up of millions of specialized cells that are in constant communication with each other through complex chemical pathways. All activity in and between cells is regulated by the DNA in the nucleus of each cell. Healthy cells reproduce, perform specialized functions, and set in motion a sequence of self-destruction when their usefulness declines, making way for new, healthy cells. If cellular DNA or other critical cell structures are damaged, this process of renewal can be compromised.* Mitochondria and Cellular Energy DNA also regulates the proliferation of mitochondria in cells. Mitochondria are cellular structures in which oxygen and food nutrients are metabolized to create energy for life. Healthy mitochondria function like well-tuned engines, producing efficient power with less exhaust (metabolic waste). As we age, the number and efficiency of cellular mitochondria can decrease, resulting in decreased energy and performance. Unhealthy mitochondria also put out more toxic exhaust in the form of free-radical molecules that can damage cellular DNA, setting off a cascading oxidative chain reaction that can damage critical cell structures and disrupt healthy cell function.Alpha CRS+\u00ae Cellular Vitality Complex Made with SLS-free vegetable Holdings, LLC Alpha CRS+ PIP US 020921Free-radical Molecules Free-radical molecules are unstable molecules with one or more unpaired electrons. When free-radical molecules come in contact with stable molecules, they steal electrons from them turning stable molecules into unstable free-radical molecules that, in turn, steal electrons from other stable molecules. This cascading process of free-radical damage is called oxidation. Free-radical damage to cells can come from external and internal sources, but the primary free-radical or oxidative stress to cellular DNA comes from cellular metabolism of energy. When cellular DNA and other critical cell structures are damaged by free-radical molecules, cells do not function optimally. Antioxidants and Polyphenols Cells are equipped to defend against oxidative damage by employing electron-rich molecules called antioxidants to neutralize free-radical molecules. Cells use antioxidants derived from the foods we eat and manufacture other antioxidants to keep oxidative stress in check. Reducing oxidative damage to cellular DNA and other important cell structures will support healthy cell function.* Antioxidants are found in great variety and abundance in plants and are plentiful in colorful fruits and vegetables. Polyphenols are a particularly powerful group of antioxidants that provide protection against free-radical damage to cellular DNA.* They have a very high capacity (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity or ORAC) to neutralize free-radical molecules and have been studied for a number of longevity health benefits.* Endogenous Antioxidant Protection The antioxidants we consume in food are called exogenous antioxidants. The body is also capable of creating other antioxidants called endogenous antioxidants. Endogenous antioxidants often have very short life cycles and are used very rapidly in metabolic processes. In addition to providing exogenous antioxidant protection against free- radical damage to cells, polyphenols also support the endogenous production and recycling of antioxidants made in the body.* Healthy Oxidative Stress Left unchecked, exposure to high levels of free radicals can leave the body more vulnerable to the oxidative damage of free radical molecules. Lowering oxidative stress in cells can help maintain healthy cellular function. Certain food nutrients also have been demonstrated to help the body recover from occasional high exposure to free radicals. Alpha CRS+ Cellular Vitality Complex dTERRA\u00ae Alpha CRS+\u00ae Cellular Vitality Complex is a proprietary dietary supplement formulated with potent levels of powerful polyphenols that support healthy cell function by providing antioxidant protection to cellular DNA and other critical cell structures.* The cellular longevity polyphenol blend found in Alpha CRS+ includes concentrated extracts turmeric root, and silymarin from milk to support the body's internal production of endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione.* The blend also includes a proprietary blend of boswellic acid and bromelain protease enzyme that support healthy cellular function.* And because vitality means feeling younger not just living longer, Alpha CRS+\u00ae includes a cellular energy blend of important metabolic factors of cellular energy, including coenzyme Q10, alpha- lipoic acid, and acetyl-L-carnitine.* Alpha CRS+ also includes a botanical extract of Ginko biloba to help support mental clarity and energy.* Combining potent levels of polyphenol antioxidants with metabolic factors of cellular energy production not only supports healthy proliferation of mitochondria in cells, it also supports efficient energy production and management of free-radical by-products of energy metabolism.* Alpha CRS+ is formulated to be used daily with xEO Mega\u00ae or vEO Mega\u00ae and Microplex VMz\u00ae as a comprehensive dietary supplement foundation for a lifetime of vitality and wellness.* Coupled with dTERRA\u00ae CPTG Certified Pure Tested GradeTM essential oils and a commitment to the dTERRA Wellness Lifestyle of eating right, exercising, resting and managing stress, reducing toxic load, informed self care, and proactive health care, Alpha CRS+ will help support you and your goals to look, feel, and live younger, longer.*3 *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

Save $69 by buying them in the pack.FAQS Q: Does this product contain genetically modified material? A: Alpha CRS+ does not contain genetically modified material. Q: Can my children take this product? A: dTERRA recommends dTERRA A2Z Chewable and IQ Mega\u00ae for children rather than the Lifelong Vitality Pack. For older children or teenagers that can swallow capsules, a half dose is probably OK, though there is limited research of these ingredients. For any questions please consult your pediatrician. Q: How is this product different from DDR Prime\u00ae? A: Alpha CRS+ contains a proprietary blend of extracts that contribute to the four main benefits of LLV: antioxidant support, increased energy, building the immune system, and improved mental clarity.* DDR Prime is a proprietary essential oil blend that targets cellular health, including the nervous system, cellular immunity, cellular communication, and cell health.* The overall benefits you feel may be similar, though the effects occur through different mechanisms in the body. One product may be more effective than the other depending on individual needs. Q: Of all the LLV products, why is this one the most expensive? A: Alpha CRS+ is usually recommended to be taken as part of LLV, at a significant discount. If you were to purchase it individually, there are several reasons for the higher cost. Alpha CRS+ contains a wide variety of high quality complex extracts from plants from all over the world, with scientifically validated benefits.* Each one requires significant expertise to harvest, prepare, and study for your benefit. Q: What does Alpha CRS+ mean? A: \"Alpha\" means first or foremost; \"CRS\" stands for Cellular Renewal System; and the \"+\" sign reflects improvements that have been made to the product since it was first launched. Q: Do I need to take this with food? A: Alpha CRS+ should always be taken immediately before or right at the beginning of a full meal. 4 *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
