An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. Solicited local AEs are pre-defined local (at the injection site) AEs. Participants will be asked to note in the diary occurrences of injection site pain/tenderness, erythema and swelling at the study vaccine injection site daily for 14 days post-vaccination (day of vaccination and the subsequent 14 days). - Number of Participants with Solicited Systemic AEs [ Time Frame: Up to Day 15 (until 14 days post-vaccination) ]Number of participants with solicited systemic AEs will be reported. Participants will be instructed on how to record daily temperature using a thermometer and also instructed to note signs and symptoms in the diary on a daily basis for 14 days post-vaccination (day of vaccination and the subsequent 14 days). Solicited systemic AEs are fatigue, headache, nausea, and myalgia. - Number of Participants with Unsolicited AEs [ Time Frame: Up to Day 30 (until 29 days post-vaccination) ]Number of participants with unsolicited AEs will be reported. Unsolicited AEs are all AEs for which the participant is not specifically questioned in the participant diary. - Number of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) [ Time Frame: Up to 3 years ]A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product; is medically important. - Short Form-36 (SF-36) Total Scores [ Time Frame: Up to 3 years ]The SF-36 is a 36-item questionnaire with a recall period for all items of 1 week. The SF 36 version 2 includes 8 domains that measure physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role limitations due to emotional problems (RE) and mental health (MH). The 8 domains can be aggregated into 2 summary scales that reflect physical and mental health: a physical component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS). Responses to all items are rated on a 3-, 5- or 6-point Likert scale. The scores range from 0 (lowest or worst possible level of functioning) to 100 (highest or best possible level of functioning). - European Quality of Life (EuroQol) 5-Dimension 5-Level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) Scores [ Time Frame: Up to 3 years ]The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status. It is a 5-item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression plus a visual analog scale rating \"health today\" with anchors ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). - Change from Baseline in Frailty Index [ Time Frame: Baseline to 3 years ]Frailty will be assessed at baseline based on Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score and will be calculated using participants self-reported information regarding health status (components of SF-36 and EQ-5D), and baseline health conditions collected through medical conditions of interest. The specific medical conditions of interest used for the calculation of the frailty index score will include: diabetes mellitus, history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, hypertension, history of cerebrovascular disease (sequelae of stroke), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, gastric or duodenal ulcer, long term disability or handicap, hearing problems, migraine, cataract, and glaucoma. Total Frailty Index, ranging from 0 (not frail or best possible score) to 43 (frail or worst possible score), will be calculated as accumulation of individual's deficits. - Medical Resource Utilization (MRU) for IED Events [ Time Frame: Up to Day 366 Post-IED ]MRU for IED events will be reported. - MRU for UTI Events [ Time Frame: Up to Day 29 Post-UTI ]MRU for UTI events (for immunogenicity subset only that is for participants from selected study sites who have given informed consent prior to randomization for additional immunogenicity assessments) will be reported. - MRU for Acute Bacterial Prostatitis (ABP) [ Time Frame: Up to Day 29 Post-ABP ]Medical resource utilization for ABP events (for immunogenicity subset only that is for participants from selected study sites who have given informed consent prior to randomization for additional immunogenicity assessments) will be reported. - Number of Participants with the Hospitalization for IED or, UTI, or ABP Events [ Time Frame: Up to 3 years ]Number of participants with hospitalization for IED or, UTI, or ABP events will be reported. - Length of Stay in Hospital for IED, UTI, or ABP Events [ Time Frame: Up to 3 years ]Length of stay in hospital for IED, UTI, or ABP events will be reported. - Number of Participants with the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Hospitalization for IED or UTI or ABP Events [ Time Frame: Up to 3 months ]Number of participants with ICU hospitalization for IED or UTI or ABP events will be reported. - Length of ICU Stay in Hospital for IED, UTI, or ABP Events [ Time Frame: Up to 3 months ]Length of ICU stay in hospital for IED, UTI, or ABP events will be reported. - Number of Participants with IED-related and All-cause Mortality [ Time Frame: Up to 3 years ]Number of participants with IED-related and all-cause mortality will be reported.
