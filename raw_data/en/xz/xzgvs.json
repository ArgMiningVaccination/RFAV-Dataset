Dr. Tayo Fadiran, SVP Regulatory Affairs Anavex Life Sciences Corp. is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of differentiated therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and rare, orphan indications such as Rett syndrome, for which the FDA has awarded orphan designation for ANAVEX 2-73. Anavex's lead drug candidate, ANAVEX 2-73, is an orally available, small-molecule activator of the sigma-1 receptor 5 restoring cellular homeostasis by targeting protein misfolding, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation and cellular stress, factors in both neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. ANAVEX 2-73 Phase 2a clinical trial in Alzheimer's disease met both primary and secondary endpoints. ANAVEX 2-73 demonstrate a favorable safety, bioavailability, dose-response curve and cognitive and functional benefits. ANAVEX 2-73 demonstrated also efficacy in the following preclinical animal models: Rett syndrome (data from the Rett Syndrome Foundation), epileptic seizures (data from the NIH), Parkinson's disease (data from The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research), Fragile X-autism-related disorders (data from the Fraxa Foundation), depression, anxiety and multiple sclerosis (MS), indicating its potential to treat additional CNS disorders. Anavex was awarded a grant from the Rett syndrome Foundation to commence a Phase 2 trial with ANAVEX 2-73. Aquestive Attendees: 1. Mr. TJ Stalvey, Director of Clinical Operations 2.

Dr. Margaret Lee, VP and Head of Translational Medicine 3. Mr. Evan Newbold, Research Analyst Cavion is a precision medicine biopharmaceutical company committed to \"white space\" neurological indications that have substantial unmet medical needs, and the application of genomics, 6 breakthrough digital technologies and artificial intelligence to reinvent translational sciences. Cavion's strong biology, small molecule platform, clinical development expertise and patient-centered clinical trials allow aspire to bring a meaningful difference in the lives of patients. Voltage-gated Cav3 channels are the primary gatekeepers of neuronal activity. By allowing calcium influx in neurons, Cav3 triggers changes that lead to healthy neuronal firing and normal physiological neuronal network activity. Abnormal neuronal network activity is a key pathophysiological feature of many neurologic disorders, including Epilepsy, Essential Tremor, Parkinson's Disease and pain. Human genetics and pharmacology, functional neuroimaging, and a large body of preclinical datasets support the biological plausibility of state-dependent, selective and potent Cav3 antagonism as a therapeutic target in these conditions. By mediating the activity of distinct neuronal networks, Cav3 can restore the brain's natural rhythms. Existing Cav3 modulators demonstrate clinical validation, but the full exploration of the utility of Cav3 antagonists as therapeutics has been limited by their lack of potency and off-target pharmacology. Cavion possesses best-in-class modulators with high potency and selectivity as well as favorable safety and tolerability profiles. CX-8998 has achieved proof-of-human-biology during Phase 1 and is currently in Ph2 development for idiopathic generalized epileptic syndromes with Absence Seizures. Cavion seeks to expand and accelerate the development of improved treatments for epilepsy through collaboration. We welcome the opportunity to expand our relationships with neurology innovators from industry and academic institutions. Cerecor Eisai Attendees: 1. Dr. Lynn Kramer, Chief Clinical Officer 2.

Understanding that epilepsy patients and their caregivers need more than just medications to navigate their condition on a day-to-day basis, we provide a \"total care\" treatment approach with programs and services that focus on resources, support and education. In partnership with the Child Neurology Foundation, we developed Transitions of Care, a program that provides resources to help those living with epilepsy, and/or their caregivers, navigate and simplify the transition from their pediatric neurology team to their adult neurology team. To help reduce the stigma associated with 7 epilepsy, we teamed with Jumo Health to create six epilepsy-related Medikidz\u00ae comic books, whose animated superheroes explain medical conditions by providing accurate and engaging information for young people and their families. We also developed the Magnolia Paws for Compassion program in partnership with the Epilepsy Foundation and 4 Paws for Ability, which is designed to raise awareness of the support that animal assistance can provide to families affected by epilepsy or seizure disorders.
