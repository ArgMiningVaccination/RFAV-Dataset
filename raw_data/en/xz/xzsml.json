Our visiting policy is to help you and your fellow patients rest and have your meal uninterrupted. Some patients may require some extra family help and support while in hospital e.g. assistance with meals and other activities, and when this is encouraged a special arrangement is put in place with the ward manager to facilitate out of hours visiting, if appropriate, for immediate family relatives. Similarly, flexible visiting may be permitted for critically ill patients, however this needs to be agreed directly with the ward manager. Visitors are regarded as an important part of the patient's day and are very welcome. Visitors should have consideration for all patients and staff. Noise should be kept to a minimum and the number of visitors should not exceed two at any time. Visiting times to main wards in the hospital are: 2.00pm - 4.00pm 6.30pm - 8.30pm Visiting times departments/units .

NOTE: Visiting may be restricted or temporarily suspended in exceptional circumstances e.g. during outbreaks of infectious diseases such as Norovirus (Winter Vomiting Bug) etc. What ward will I be on? Medical and nursing needs will determine the allocation of hospital accommodation. This means that you may not necessarily occupy the same accommodation for the duration of your hospital stay. It may be necessary for you to be transferred between wards during the course of your hospital stay. In the case of private/semi -private patients, admission to a public bed may be necessary due to limited availability of private and semi - private beds. 8 What is the Emergency Department (ED)? The Emergency Department runs a 24 - hour, 365 -day service. On arrival to the ED, you will be triaged (assessed) by a nurse. This is a way for us to sort injured and ill people according to how urgently they need to be treated. Following assessment and treatment in the ED department, you may be admitted to a ward, transferred to another hospital or discharged home, in which case a follow -up appointment may be arranged if necessary. What is the Acute Medical Assessment Unit (AMAU)? Your GP may refer you to the Acute Medical Assessment Unit for further medical evaluation if deemed necessary. Your assessment and treatment will dictate whether you will be admitted or discharged. The A.M.A.U operates Monday to Sunday, 365 days a year, from 08.30 hrs to 19.00 hrs.

Useful Information The following leaflets are available on the St. Luke's General Hospital website https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/3/acutehospitals/hospitals/ lukeskilkenny/useful -information/leaflets/ Discharge Lounge Pre-Assessment Unit Infection Prevention & Control Surgical Leaflets 19 Infection Prevention & Control Preventing healthcare associated infections is a challenge for hospitals today. If patients, visitors and staff adhere to correct infection prevention and control practices, then we can minimise or prevent the risk of transmission of infection to our patients, our visitors and our staff. Clean Hands Saves Lives Use alcohol hand gel/wash your hands Alcohol hand gel is provided at the entrance to the hospital and is located on all wards and in clinical and outpatient areas of the hospital. Please use the alcohol hand gel before entering and leaving the hospital. The gel should also be used before and after contact with the patient whom you are visiting. Hand hygiene must be undertaken after coughing, sneezing, blowing nose and disposing of tissues. It is important for patients, visitors and staff to wash their hands with soap and water if they are soiled/after visiting the toilet/if staff advises you to do so. Is it ok to ask a member of staff to clean their hands? We encourage patients to ask all health care workers if they have cleaned their hands before attending them particularly if you have not seen them cleaning their hands. 20 How You Can Help? Keep your bed space clutter free and we ask that you co-operate with the hospital cleaning staff when they want to clean around the bed -space, and keep belongings to a minimum. Please only bring essential items into the hospital and keep them in the lockers provided. Wear appropriate footwear when walking around the wards. This keeps your feet clean so that bacteria cannot be transferred from your feet to the bed. If you see any dirt, dust, clutter or untidiness either around your bed or in the toilets or bathrooms inform the ward staff. Keep visitors to a minimum - close friends and family only. Young children and babies should be discouraged from visiting where possible and only in circumstances when it is in the best interest of the patient or child to visit. Please adhere to the hospital visiting times. Patients should use their own toiletries and not borrow or lend to others. Patients may use their own disposable hand hygiene wipes. There is no storage facility for patients own food. It is recommended not to bring perishables into the ward area. Patients and visitors must not touch the patient's wounds, bandages and dressings or medical equipment of any kind. Tell staff immediately if your dressing becomes loose or a wound or intravenous drip site becomes sore or painful. Reduce the risk of infection If you have, or have had a health care associated infection in the past such as MRSA, CRE, etc., please inform your admitting nurse or doctor. In an effort to stop the spread of healthcare care associated infections, your admitting nurse may ask your permission to obtain swabs to test for MRSA, CRE or VRE. Some or all of the following sites may be tested: nose, groin, rectum, wounds, urine or other sites if necessary. Isolation Patients with infections that can transmit easily from patient to patient may be cared for in single rooms or dedicated multi bedded bays. If a patient needs to be isolated, this should be explained to the patient by their doctor. 21 How your visitors can help to reduce the risk of infection to you and other patients? Chairs are provided for visitors. Visitors should not sit on patients beds or place their feet on the bed. Visitors should visit the person they have come to see and not other patients. This will reduce the risk of transferring potentially harmful infections from person to person. Do not visit if you have a cold, flu, diarrhoea, vomiting or chicken pox. If visitors feel unwell or have an infection they should not visit until they are feeling better. They should be free of any symptoms (e.g. vomiting and diarrhoea) for 48 hours before they visit a patient. Visitors should not bring children with them who are ill, especially if they have recent history (within 48 hours) of diarrhoea and or vomiting, this is extremely important as vomiting and diarrhoea can pose a significant problem to patients. Before you bring children in, ask the Clinical Nurse Manager (the nurse in charge). Please read any notices on the doors as you go through and follow the instructions. Please do not use patients' toilets. There are separate toilets for visitors. Do not bring in any perishable food. 22 Friends of St Luke's The Friends of St Luke's General Hospital Carlow/Kilkenny started in 1991. Its aim is to support the work of all staff at St Luke's General Hospital Carlow/Kilkenny to ensure that the patient gets the best available treatment and service to aid their recovery. The Department of Health provide our hospital with what is considered the necessary equipment, technology and staff to provide a service to the people of Carlow, Kilkenny and the surrounding catchment areas. We, the Friends, see our role as supporting the Department of Health and allowing our hospital to have not only what is necessary but also what is desirable. We have over the years purchased a CAT scanner, Cardiac monitors, defibrillators, resuscitation trollies, Physiotherapy equipment, Emergency Department equipment, Surgical equipment for Theatre, ERCP equipment, Dexa scanner, MRI Scanner, ICU monitors, bronchoscope, sleep apnoea equipment, Special Baby Care equipment, TVs, video players, beds, chairs, etc. Why do we do it? We do it because the patients and staff at our hospital needed these desirable pieces of equipment and services and the funds available to our hospital at times does not cover these services. We do it because we see the patient as the centre of our purpose. We want the best for the patients in St Luke's General Hospital Carlow/ Kilkenny. We want our consultants, doctors and nurses to have the best available and modern equipment. We do not want the people of Carlow and Kilkenny to be travelling long distances to get a service that could be provided just as well at St Luke's .This will hasten patient recovery since the patient is still within their own community. Donations to the hospital may be made directly to the Friends of St. Luke's Hospital by addressing correspondence to: The Secretary The Friends of St. Luke's General Hospital Kilkenny/ Carlow 23 Who are the Hospital Volunteers?
