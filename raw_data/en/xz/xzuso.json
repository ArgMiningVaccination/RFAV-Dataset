Recognizing pain is fundamental to successful treatment, and diagnostic guides and algorithms are included for assessment of both acute and chronic pain. Particularly for chronic pain, capturing owner evaluation is important, and pain-assessment instruments for pet owners are described. Expert consensus emphasizes proactive, preemptive pain management rather than a reactive, \"damage control \"approach. The guidelines discuss treat- ment options centered on preemptive, multimodal analgesic therapies. There is an extensive variety of pharmacologic andnonpharmacologic therapeutic options for the management of acute and chronic pain in cats and dogs. The guidelines include a tiered decision tree that prioritizes the use of the most ef cacious therapeutic modalities for the treatment of acute and pain.

CONTRIBUTING REVIEWERS Kristin Jankowski, VMD, CCRP, (University of California Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, Community Practice); Douglas Stramel, DVM, CVPP, Lascelles were co-chairs of the Pain Management Guidelines Task Force. These guidelines were prepared by a task force of experts convened by the American Animal Hospital Association. This document is intended as a guideline only, not an AAHA standard of care. These guidelines and recommendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive protocol, course of treatment, or procedure. Variations in practice may be warranted based on the needs of the individual patient, resources, and limitations unique to each individual practice setting. Evidence- based support for specic recommendations has been cited whenever possible and appropriate. Other recommendations are based on practical clinical experience and a consensus of expert opinion. Further research is needed to document some of these recommendations. Because each case is different, veterinarians must base their decisions on the best available scientic evidence in conjunction with their own knowledge and experience. \u00a9 2022 by American Animal Hospital Association Introduction Pain management is central to veterinary clinical practice. Alleviating pain is not only a professional obligation, as re flected in the veteri- narian 's oath, but a key contributor to successful case outcomes and enhancement of the veterinarian-client-pet relationship. The primarypurpose of these guidelines is to help veterinarians and veterinary team members con dently and accurately create a reproduceable pain assessment in cats and dogs, as well as an initial therapy plan with guidance on reassessing and adjusting the plan as needed. As such, these guidelines discuss pain management as a therapeutic con- tinuum consisting of assessment, treatment, reassessment, and planrevision. Pain management has been recognized as an essential compo- nent of compassionate care in canine and feline medicine \u2014increas- ingly so over the last 20 years. With the approval of safe and effective nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory agents for veterinary use in the 1990s, analgesia became accessible as a therapeutic mainstay in postoperative settings and in cases of chronic pain. Although pain management is now an established component of therapy, the development of newanalgesics and nonpharmacologic modalities makes this a still evolv-ing facet of clinical practice. For this reason, these guidelines build onand update 2015 AAHA-AAFP pain management recommenda- tions, 1with the addition of the following topics of interest: /C15A systematic approach to making reproducible pain assessments, including a discussion of available assessment methods and tools. /C15Rather than present a randomized list, or buffet, of treatmentoptions, a tiered decision tree based on evaluating acute and chronic pain has been developed to help with prioritizing the use of the most efcacious therapeutic modalities . /C15The evolution of pain management from a reactive intervention to a proactive, preemptive, and multimodal strategy involving the entire practice team. /C15Guidance on how pain management should differentiate betweencanine and feline patients, with an emphasis on the particular fea- tures of feline behavior. These topics are accompanied by pertinent recent updates on pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment modalities summa- rized in easy-to-reference tables. Using these resources, clinicians can make informed decisions on developing effective, case-speci ct r e a t - ment plans. Two concepts underlying this approach are preemptive analgesia to minimize pain onset and nociceptive pathology, and a multimodal treatment strategy to offset overreliance on any singledrug with the attendant risk of side effects. With respect to chronic pain, most is known about the assessment and treatment of muscu- loskeletal pain (namely, osteoarthritis [OA]), and the guidelinesreflect this. These guidelines are not intended to provide all-inclusive pharmacologic information, or a comprehensive review of feline- friendly handling techniques, nor do they attempt to present acomprehensive description of speci c painful conditions. The guide- lines further discuss the bene ts of de ned pain management roles for each practice team member and how client education plays an important part in ensuring that each patient is able to perform daily activities and maintain quality of life in clinical and home settings. An Evolving Philosophy of Pain Management Pain management in companion animal practice is no longer limited to providing analgesia after fracture repair (i.e., acute pain) or pre- scribing a nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drug (NSAID) to an osteo- arthritic dog that can no longer climb stairs (i.e., chronic pain). Asadvocates of our patients whose owners are often unaware of the signs of pain, our thinking must evolve around pain management to include the rapid detection of pain, combined with early multimodal intervention. We must switch our focus from damage control pain management to proactive pain management. This philosophical shift is particularly relevant to handling chronic pain, in which problems are not quickly resolved and must be managed over the long term. Chronic pain is ubiquitous in companion animals, most commonlyas the result of OA, whose reported prevalence appears to be close to 40% in dogs and .50% in cats. 2-4Chronic pain may also be a conse- quence of dental, spinal, or cancer pain and other chronic condi-tions. Managing pain in companion animals must take a collabora- tive approach, coordinated by owners and a veterinary team who are alert and responsive to changes. Proactive and Preemptive Pain Management It is well accepted that acute surgical pain is most effectively managed preemptivel y.5,6In this context, \"preemptive \"means administering analgesic therapies as early on in the disease process as possible or, inthe example of preemptive perioperative analgesia, administering analgesics prior to the start of surgery. This philosophy of manage- ment can also be applied to chronic pain \u2014treating earlier in the dis- ease process to prevent the adverse effects of ongoing noxious input. Preemptive treatment, across both acute and chronic pain, is most effective if a proactive approach to pain management is taken. This approach means understanding when pain may be present, tak- ing proactive steps to assess for pain, and educating and engaging the whole veterinary team and owners about pain assessment. For acute pain, this means having the whole veterinary team educated in how to assess pain in the clinic and putting in place pro-active protocols to assess and reassess pain. In chronic pain conditions, this begins by making owners aware of the risk of chronic disease and its accompanying pain. For exam-ple, several dog breeds are at high risk of hip dysplasia, elbow 56 JAAHA | 58:2 Mar/Apr 2022dysplasia, or patellar luxation, as shown by the statistics of the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (https://www.ofa.org/diseases/ breed-statistics). Similarly, the majority of cats .10 years of age show signs of OA pain. Proactive pain management also includes implementing meas- ures to slow the progression of chronic problems that can be associ- ated with pain. For example, in dogs at risk of OA, growth should be slowed to minimize the expression of faulty genes,7body condition should remain within the optimal range,8and exercise should be encouraged as it may be protective for hip dysplasia.9Dogs should be acclimated to activities that become part of their long-term man-agement such as leash walks or the application of a cold pack. Owner engagement is key to shifting toward proactive treat- ment for chronic pain conditions. Musculoskeletal pain (e.g., OA) is v e r yc o m m o ni nd o g sa n dc a t s ,a n dc l i e n t sc a nb ee n g a g e di nt h e process of watching their pets for changes in posture, gait, demeanor, and ability to perform daily activities and regularly asked about behavioral changes they observe. Owners can also be educated regarding the high prevalence of chronic pain among pets and the unique postures or behaviors that animals adopt as attempts to alle- viate pain. The importance of how pain management is communi- cated to the owner by an aligned practice team cannot be overem- phasized. Early symptoms of chronic disease should be proactively looked for, fully discussed with owners, and managed promptly so that early acute pain does not progress to chronic pain that is more resistant to treatment. Coordinated Pain Management Coordinated pain management extends the responsibility for the development and implementation of the treatment plan to the whole veterinary team. This requires that everyone on the team under- stands the signs of pain and principles of pain management in order to adopt a common vision for patient care. Ideally, a case coordina- tor, usually a veterinary technician, would be delegated to regularly reach out to a pet owner and make sure that pain is being effectively managed and pets are willing and able to perform daily activities. Communication between the technician and veterinarian is vital. Patients would then be reevaluated regularly (every 3 -6m o n t h s ) with additional evaluations if problems are identi ed by the case coordinator or owner. To optimize adherence, owners need tounderstand the reasons for early intervention, and therapy should minimize the nancial, physical, emotional, and logistical burden placed on caretakers. The management of chronic pain is a continu-ing service that the veterinary team offers its clients. The service philosophy generates a strong bond with the owner and protects com- panion animals from the severe impact of undertreated chronic pain.Gentle Handling It is important to focus on conscious awareness of gentle, or animal- friendly, handling of all patients \u2014but especially the painful patient. As some owners do not appreciate their pet 's condition in the absence of a clearly painful response to manipulation, it can be nec-essary to educate the client on nonverbal or less severe reactions given by the patient (e.g., holding breath, licking of the lips, looking away) versus vocalization. This approach will also allow for a more complete physical examination with the pet 's cooperation and will demonstrate to the client that the practice team has a strong aware-ness of the need to minimize the patient' sp a i n . For cats, previously published guidelines on feline-friendly han- dling practices provide a more detailed discussion of this importantaspect of pain management. 10Previsit medications such as trazodone or gabapentin may still be given prior to appointments; althoughsome sedation may be present, these drugs will not produce analgesia to the extent that pain cannot be used as a diagnostic tool, and calmer pets are more compliant with physical and orthopedicexaminations. Pain Assessment Toolbox Guiding Principles of Pain Assessment In the following sections, we put forward a Pain Assessment Toolbox for use by the veterinary team. In designing the Pain Assessment Toolbox, the advisory panel determined the following guidingprinciples: /C15First, the practice team must consciously create a shared approach to pain management and client communication \u2014particularly for the assessment, interpretation, and explanation of acute and chronicpain. /C15Second, the concept of the physical exam must extend beyond han-dling to include observation of posture, gait, and behavior. /C15Third, an emphasis on behavioral observations, including thosereported by the owner, will not increase the time needed for exams. /C15Finally, across all principles, the assessment of pain is different between cats and dogs, requiring different tools, observations, and communication techniques. These principles function with the knowledge that the presenta- tion differs between acute and chronic pain, requiring a distinctly different approach for assessment and communication with pet own- ers. Compared with chronic pain, assessment of acute pain is typi-cally more straightforward for both the veterinarian and the pet owner. In acute pain conditions, the response to palpation and gen- erally recognizable signs are more easily observed. For pet owners, however, there is often a discrepancy between identi cation of acute and chronic pain. Owners often focus on watching for signs of acutepain rather than the gradual behavioral changes indicative of chronic pain. This discrepancy highlights the importance of the rst pain2022 AAHA Pain Management Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 57assessment principle \u2014a shared approach to pain management and client communication. Because owners may be unaware of or under- estimate the presence of chronic pain, client education and engage- ment is critical to both the identi cation of and appreciation for the need for chronic pain treatment. The practical application of thisprinciple differs for cats and dogs. For cats, many of the important behavioral signs of chronic pain are most detectable in the home, so detection is more effective with owner input. For dogs, a shift in cli- ent perception is needed to appreciate the potential for chronic pain to develop even in young dogs and the need for lifelong management. The second and third pain assessment principles present a shift- ing mindset regarding the physical examination, extending it beyond the hands-on evaluation to include observations of the spontaneous behaviors of the patient. For the clinician, assessments of visually obvious problems and hands-on palpation remain critical to evalua- tion of the patient. Yet equally important are the more subtle aspects of patient behavior that may be evaluated as soon as the veterinarian or veterinary technician and animal enter the exam room. These behavioral signs can often be observed while conversing with the cli- ent, and with experience and practice, these observations need not add any time to the examination. Under the principle that any extra energy expended by an animal to alter a behavior is done to preserve comfort, changes in how a dog walks or sits or how a cat jumps down from an exam table can provide information that aids our diagnosis. Our ability to point out these behavioral changes to owners can encourage them to watch for these pain-related behaviors at home. This is especially important for cats, in whom the most common cause of chronic pain \u2014degenerative joint disease/OA \u2014presents pri- marily as behavioral changes that owners are best positioned todetect. Pain Assessment Tools for Cats Assessment of pain in cats involves a convergence of evidence fromphysical examination (including observation of behavior), owner input (including standardized questionnaires and video), and imag- ing as indicated. Several features of a cat 's natural behavior in fluence the behavioral signs seen with pain and discomfort. As mid-level predators, cats display both predatory and prey-type behaviors. Cats may not overtly express pain, but they do exhibit detectable signs. C a t sa r es m a l la n da g i l ea n dd e p e n do nt h e i ra b i l i t yt oj u m pa n d climb to escape danger. When escape is not possible, cats may use aggression to defend themselves. However, cats do not use aggression as an early defense and typically use elaborate chemocommunication to avoid con flict. Because the ability to escape is critical to a cat 'ssense of safety, their access to vertical spaces must be preserved. When cats with painful conditions are unable to access elevated spaces, affective signs such as changes in sociability and mood and reduced tolerance of handling become visible across owner and clini- cal assessments. Table 1 summarizes the various pain assessment tools for use with feline patients. Figure 1 illustrates a logical approach to the diagnosis and monitoring of acute or perioperative pain, and chronic pain, in cats. Acute and Perioperative Assessment of Pain in Cats For assessing acute pain and postoperative comfort in the clinic, response to palpation and clinical metrology instruments should be employed. The use of a standardized scale allows consistent monitor- ing and response to additional analgesic interventions. The Colorado State University Acute Pain scale, Glasgow short-form pain scale, and UNESP-multi-dimensional pain scale are the most commonly used tools. A Feline Grimace Scale that relies on facial expressions as an indication of pain has been recently introduced.11Although initial training is needed, the Feline Grimace Scale can be used by veteri-narians and technicians to quickly assess pain without palpation. Owners may also bring videos of their cat 'sb e h a v i o ra th o m ef o r assessment. A version of the Feline Grimace Scale for owners is avail-able as an app and online (http://www.felinegrimacescale.com). Con- versations with owners should focus on changes that they have seen in the cat 's behavior, affect, and activities of daily living; these may reflect more sudden changes occurring over a brief period of time, compared with the progressive changes of chronic pain that occur over a period of months. More information can be found in the ISFM 's Guidelines on Acute Pain Management in Cats. Chronic Pain Assessment in Cats Assessment by Owners In contrast to acute pain, owner assessment of behavior has a central role in the detection and monitoring of chronic pain in cats. The majority of the standardized clinical metrology instruments in use have been developed for owners to complete. Pain caused by degen- erative joint disease is the most common form of chronic pain in cats, and this area has received the most research for instrument development and validation. These instruments ask owners to rate their cat' s ability to perform behaviors known to be affected by chronic musculoskeletal pain. They are simple to use and have goodreproducibility and generate a score that can be tracked over time. However, a gap exists between owner awareness of the disease pro- cess and recognition of behavioral changes in their cat. 12Because these changes develop gradually over time, owners who are notactively monitoring for these signs may miss them initially. Owner 58 JAAHA | 58:2 Mar/Apr 2022education and engagement will increase the detection of chronic musculoskeletal pain in cats.12 Clinical metrology instruments in regular use can be divided into those used for screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of disease.For screening, a checklist of six behaviors has been developed to help identify cats likely to have chronic musculoskeletal pain. 12For these six behaviors (running, jumping up, jumping down, going up stairs,going down stairs, and chasing objects), owners are asked if their cat is able to perform them normally or not, with negative responsestriggering further evaluation. Several tools have been developed for diagnosis and monitoring, with most support for the Feline Muscu- loskeletal Pain Index 13-15and Montreal Cat Arthritis Test (both for diagnosis and monitoring)16and Client-Speci c Outcome Measures (monitoring only).17,18Therst two instruments are general ques- tionnaires with standardized behaviors. Owners either rate (using aLikert scale) or indicate \"yes\"or\"no\"for a series of behaviors impacted by chronic musculoskeletal pain. The Client-Speci cO u t - comes Measures instrument is tailored to activities that are impairedin an individual cat. Although these can be highly salient for catowners, the selection of appropriate activities and setup for the instrument can be time consuming. Owners may also provide videos of their cats performing spe- cic behaviors in the home. This is relatively convenient but requires some client training to c a p t u r et h ew h o l ec a ti nt h ef r a m e ,t h ew h o l eb e h a v i o rs e q u e n c e , and adequate lighting to make evaluation possible. The six behaviors described above can be documented using video. When done well, video of cat behavior can offer an opportunity to evaluate behaviors rarely seen during the clinical assessment. Clinician Assessment of Pain in Cats Evaluation of cats in the clinic for chronic pain can be dif cult owing to changes in behavior that result from the visit itself; clinical assess- ment will be affected by the cat 's level of stress. Observation of the cat's smoothness of movement, hair coat, and posture prior to the hands-on exam can offer important insight into overall comfort. Although a few cats may be convinced to jump up onto a bench or chair, most can be observed jumping down.

Signs include tensing of the area, a change in vocalization (increased or decreased), or an attempt to move away. Imaging of an area where pain is found is important to identify pathology, but itshould not substitute for (or replace the ndings of) the physicalexamination. For example, cats with OA may have painful joints with normal imaging or nonpainful joints with highly abnormal imaging. 19When evaluating pain, it is important to prioritize the cat's behavior over the radiographic ndings.

Conversely, assessment of chronic pain depends on ownerinput to a much greater extent.

This flow diagram outlines a basic approach to the assessment of pain in cats. For assessment of both acute and chronic pain, the core elements are physical examination/palpation and the use of Clinical Metrol-ogy Instruments (CMIs) (see Table 1). CMIs that are specic for particular circumstances (e.g., for specic types of surgery or for specic chronic diseases) are being developed, tested, and validated. Future assessment tools in the cat are likely to leverage automated analysis offacial expression and movement, and these may well become core elements assisting with the everyday assessment of pain. At the moment,for chronic pain, all the CMIs designed to assess the impact of pain have been developed for osteoarthritis. Importantly, this flow diagram illustrates two important points: (1) involvement of the owner and (2) follow-up and reassessment.2022 AAHA Pain Management Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 61owners to identify behaviors associated with chronic pain and to then observe and monitor those behaviors using tools developed for specic conditions and overall quality-of-life tools as they are developed. Veterinarians need to recognize the power of our observations throughout a clinic visit in the assessment of cats, particularly for chronic musculoskeletal pain, and need to keep in mind that the absence of changes on imaging does not mean an absence of pain. Pain Assessment Tools for Dogs Pain assessment in dogs involves tools that range widely, from func-tional signs evaluated by owners and physical signs detected by clini-cians to physiological signs measured by researchers ( Table 2 ). Assessment methods range from empiric and unvalidated (e.g.,\"How is your dog climbing stairs? \") to validated (e.g., peak vertical forces measured by force plates). Assessment methods vary widely inlabor required, complexity, and cost. Pain assessment is most practi- cally divided into the assessment of acute or perioperative pain and chronic pain ( Figure 2 ). Acute and Perioperative Canine Pain Assessment In the clinic, pain assessment includes appetite, observation ofdemeanor, behavior, and palpation. Dogs adjust their demeanor,behavior, posture, and movement to minimize pain. Inappetence andcalm behavior can represent subtle signs of pain. As with cats, clinical metrology instruments have been developed to capture/measure these behavioral signs, and their incorporation into practice protocols isencouraged. These are for use in the clinic. Findings are converted into a score, such as the Colorado State University Canine Acute Pain Scale or Glasgow short-form Composite Measure Pain scale, whichcan be tracked over time. No owner-completed assessment tools foracute pain have been developed. Therefore, \"at-home \"acute pain assessment by the owners should be guided by the veterinary team.Owners know their dogs 'normal behavior. Deviations from that b e h a v i o rs u g g e s tt h ep r e s e n c eo fp a i n .T h er e v i e wo fs h o r tv i d e o sa n d photos by the veterinarian can facilitate pain-related conversations. Chronic Pain Assessment in Dogs Assessment by Owners Musculoskeletal pain (e.g., OA) is the most common form of chronic pain in dogs and where most work has been performed to under-stand how to measure it. Owners can detect the presence of pain indogs by comparing normal and abnormal behavior, but they may contextualize these signs and delay action for several months. 20,21 Owner responses to open questions \u2014such as \"how is he (or she) doing? \"\u2014can raise red flags that will warrant more speci cquestions. Red flags can also be raised using screening tools. These are not speci c for a given condition, although they may be targeted at a speci c condition. They allow a conversation focused on possible conditions. Once a condition is highly suspected or con rmed, sev- eral questionnaires are used to evaluate chronic pain. Available ques- tionnaires are mostly focused on canine OA. Questions relate to demeanor, mobility, and lifestyle, capturing information in a consis- tent and repeatable manner. The most widely used questionnairesare the Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI, 11 questions) 22,23and Liverpool Osteoarthritis in Dogs (LOAD, 23 questions).24,25The Sleep and Nighttime Restlessness Evaluation (SNoRE) questionnairefocuses on sleep quality. 26These questionnaires, which can be down- loaded and used at no cost, assume the presence of OA but may alsohelp diagnose other conditions. The client-speci c outcome meas- ures (CSOM) assessment is a questionnaire that relies on the veteri-narian to de ne a set of activities that are not being performed nor- mally and that are speci c to a pet. These \"client-dog dyad -specic\" questions are followed over time to assess response to therapy. 27Cli- ent questionnaires have been used to support the regulatory approvalof several pain medications for dogs. Although these instruments remain subject to bias, they are validated to varying degrees and pro- vide useful and actionable information. One of their most powerful features is that they standardize the questions that are posed to own- ers, allowing trends over time to be captured more accurately. Clinician Assessment of Pain in Dogs Observation is a critical part of the veterinarian assessment of chronic pain. Signs of pain can be observed when a patient is resting, standing, moving at a walk or a trot, or doing functional activitiessuch as climbing steps. At rest, awkward limb positions may indicate the presence of joint pain; for example, dogs with elbow joint pain may supinate their forelimbs and flex their carpus. When standing and moving, dogs shift weight away from a painful limb, and suchpostural abnormalities can be observed in the examination room ifthe animal is given time to relax. Recently, a staging tool has been proposed for canine OA, 28which incorporates both owner and vet- erinarian assessments. The veterinarian assessments include observa- tion of posture and motion as well as results from the hands-on eval- uation. A \"tucked up \"appearance can be an indicator of abdominal pain, and postural straining can be an indicator of lower urinarytract or lower gastrointestinal tract pain. When pain is intermittent or associated with speci c activities that are not reproducible in the clinic, pictures or videos collected by the owner and reviewed by the veterinarian provide useful pain-related information. Palpation is the most widely used clinical method to detect pain in dogs, even if surprisingly few studies have evaluated its sensitivity and speci city. 29 62 JAAHA | 58:2 Mar/Apr 2022Medical imaging is used to con rm the presence of a suspected problem. Joint pain on palpation and radiographic signs of OA often correlate poorly.19Because of that discrepancy, radiographs only conrm the cause of joint pain detected on palpation rather than assume that all radiographic abnormalities represent a source of pain. Research and Development of Assessment Tools The assessment of pain is critical to mechanistic and clinical researchto advance our understanding of pain therapy. The subjective clini- cian or owner-based assessment tools mentioned thus far are most valid when used in the clinical research setting, under blinded, pla- cebo- or active comparator -controlled conditions. In the acutesetting, other measures used include physiological variables (heart rate, blood pressure, cortisol, and c-reactive protein), wound painsensitivity thresholds, 30actigraphy to measure activity after surgery,31 and gait analysis after limb surgery.32For chronic joint pain, gait analysis \u2014particularly force plate analysis33\u2014is the core feature of the assessment of limb pain in dogs. Other gait analyses are used, includ- ing 2-D and 3-D kinematic analysis,34pressure-sensitive walkways, and weight distribution platforms.35,36Actigraphy (physical activity monitors) is emerging to evaluate the impact of pain on daily activ- ity, and validation efforts are ongoing.37-40Clinical research and development of assessment methods drive the development of assess-ment tools used in clinical practice. A considerable effort is being placed on arti cial intelligence (AI) to evaluate images or videos on pain status, particularly acute pain, and future applications may beTABLE 2 Pain Assessment Methods and Tools for Use in Dogs TOOLACUTE OR CHRONIC PAIN USER EASE OF USE PURPOSE VALIDITY* Physical examination Acute and chronicVeterinarian Moderate, requires trainingScreening, diagnosing, monitoringNot formally validated as an assessment of pain Clinic observation Acute and chronicVeterinarian and veterinary technicianModerate, requires trainingMonitoring Not formally validated as an assessment of pain Physiological variables (heart rate; respiration; blood pressure)Acute Veterinarian and veterinary technicianSimple Screening, monitoringNot specic indicators of pain Wound palpation Acute Veterinarian and veterinary technicianSimple Monitoring Not formally validated as a stand-alone assessment of pain; forms part of several validated tools Home videos and photosAcute and chronicOwner collects information Veterinarian evaluatesModerate, requires instructionsScreening, monitoringNot formally validated as an assessment of pain Force plate and pressure sensitive walkwayAcute and chronicClinical research; dedicated assessment centerChallenging monitoring)Acute (continued )2022 AAHA Pain Management Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 63developed for use in the clinic setting.

Practical Implementation of Assessment Tools Successful pain management requires veterinarians gaining skills inobservation and hands-on pain assessment, involving owners andveterinarians in pain assessment and management, and using allavailable assessment tools. Veterinary technicians and nurses mustbe trained and empowered to use the Glasgow or Colorado scales a n dt op a l p a t ep a i n f u lr e g i o n s .P a i ns c o r e ss h o u l db er e c o r d e da n dcommunicated with veterinarians.

To expect to completely eliminate pain is probablyunrealistic. Early intervention, whether in acute or chronic pain,with effective therapies makes pain easier to control. Thus, the recog-nition of situations that may be associated with pain, the assessmentof patients for pain, and proactive treatment are all critically important. Diagram illustrating descriptors used to refer to different types of pain. Pain is often classified as either acute or chronic. Arbitrarily,pain of more than 3 months 'duration has been considered chronic. However, there is nothing that suddenly changes after 3 months to create \"chronic \"pain. The mechanistic drivers of pain likely change on a continuum from acute nociceptive through to the pathologicalpain states . Acute pain is generally associated with tissue damage or the threat of this and serves the vital purpose of rapidly alteringthe animal' s behavior to avoid or minimize damage and to optimize the conditions in which healing can take place. Nociceptive andinflammatory pain are usually considered subtypes of acute or adap- tive pain. Pain of a longer duration can result in changes in the pain transmission system at multiple levels. Such changes generally facilitate and amplify pain. These changes result in a progressiveVideo from ownerCMI (chronic) Review video from owner, with ownerCMI (chronic)Acute painChronic painExamination and obervation in evaluationResponse to palpation CMI (acute)CMI (chronic) clinic At homeResponse to palpation CMI (acute) Owner feedback Video from owner Pre-visit In clinic At homeScreening or staging tools Palpation; examination In clinic re-assessmentsScreening Diagnosis MonitoringBaseline Assessment AllLegend FIGURE 2 Flow Diagram Outlining Acute and Chronic Pain Assessment in Dogs. This flow diagram outlines a basic approach to the assessment of pain in dogs. For assessment of both acute and chronic pain, the core elements are physical examination/palpation and the use of Clinical Metrology Instruments (CMIs) (see Table 2). CMIs that are specic for particular circumstances (e.g., for specic types of surgery or for spe-cic chronic diseases) are being developed, tested, and validated. At the moment, for chronic pain, all the CMIs to assess the impact of pain have been developed for osteoarthritis, although these have been applied to other \"limb pain \"conditions, such as osteosarcoma. Importantly, thisflow diagram illustrates two important points: (1) involvement of the owner and (2) follow-up and reassessment.2022 AAHA Pain Management Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 65disconnect between the peripheral lesion and the pain being per- ceived and, as such, are often described as a \"maladaptive \"or \"pathological \"pain state. Neuropathic pain (from direct damage to the nervous system) and functional pain (altered functioning of the pain transmission system) are considered subtypes of chronic or maladaptive pain. When considering this classification system, the reader will realize that clinical pain is often a mixture of all these \"types \"of pain. The longer the pain state has been going on, the more likely there is to be maladaptive pain present and the moredifficult pain is to treat. Acute painChronic pain Adaptive painMaladaptive pain pathological pain Nociceptive Neuropathic Inflammatory Functional Acute Pain of Known Cause (e.g., Perioperative or Diagnosed, Known Trauma) The mechanisms driving acute and perioperative pain are closer to nociceptive/in flammatory pain than they are to chronic or maladap- tive pain (see call-out box 1), so acute/perioperative pain is easier tomanage. Exact protocols and approaches can vary, but to be success- ful, they must be practical and feasible for the individual practice set- ting. The basic principles of effective perioperative pain managementare as follows: /C15Early, preemptive or preventive use of analgesic therapies to optimize preventive therapy . This refers to the use of analgesic therapies prior to the surgical insult, or as early as possible.41,42This approach has been shown to be of bene t in dogs.5,6 /C15Use of a multimodal approach . The pain transmission system is com- plex and has a lot of redundancy, so interrupting the pain pathwaysusing multiple differing approaches is more effective clinically thanrelying on a single receptor or mechanism. 43 /C15Providing continuous, overlapping analgesia . An analgesic plan should provide overlapping pain relief and include at least the early\"at-home \"time period. /C15Matching the provision of analgesia to the degree (dose) of surgery ortrauma . Greater tissue trauma, especially when it includes nerve damage, and more invasive and longer surgeries are generally associ- ated with more pain. 31,44,45 Effective and frequent assessment of the pain status of patients is critical both for the effective management of the individual patient and for evaluating practice protocols. Patients should be assessedpreoperatively and at regular intervals postoperatively (e.g., hourly or as appropriate for the status of the patient). Follow-up with owners should be at least daily for the rst few days and include standard questions. When feasible, review of owner-captured video is useful. Chronic Pain T h ep r a c t i c et e a m 's approach to treating chronic pain depends on the underlying cause of pain, duration, and previous treatment. Theguiding principles for the effective management of chronic pain are as follows: /C15Assessment, recognition, and acknowledgment of chronic pain. The practice team should employ checklists, clinical metrology instru- ments, and physical examinations to determine if chronic pain ispresent. /C15Use of a multimodal (combination therapy) approach . Chronic pain involves multiple and often complex changes in the sensory sys-tem. 46A combination of effective, known analgesics and nondrug therapies, combined with appropriate adjunctive ef cacious therapeutic modalities . /C15Consider the burden of care on the owner (e.g., oral medication of cats, multiple visits to the clinic for therapy). /C15Regular reassessment and adaptation of the management regimen.The pain-sensing (nociceptive) system is bidirectionally plastic; thatis, with effective pain management, the nociceptive system canreturn to normal. This means there is less pain to be managed, andthe pain management approach can be reduced and simpli ed. Using a Decision Tree for Pain Management Therapies Rather than present a list, or buffet, of treatment options, a tiered decision tree ( Figure 3 ) has been provided to help with prioritizing use of the most ef cacious therapeutic modalities. The tiered or ranked approach is based upon review of evidence-based veterinarymedicine, incorporation of pertinent literature from human medi-cine, practical considerations, and clinical experience of the advisory panel. Tier 1 treatments are those that are considered the mainstay of pain management in the respective categories. As further clinicalresearch is performed and new products are developed, the recom- mendations in each tier will be adapted. Clinicians may choose to start with tier 2 treatments, especially in combination with tier 1approaches. Treatments in different tiers can be initiated at the same time, for example, NSAIDs and therapeutic exercise for canine OA pain. Acute Pain of Unknown Cause In cases in which obvious pain is present but a diagnosis or reason for the pain has not yet been determined, effective management of that pain can facilitate management of the patient. Opioids are con-sidered appropriate in that situation. 66 JAAHA | 58:2 Mar/Apr 2022FIGURE 3 Decision Tree for Prioritizing Pain Management Therapies. This gure outlines a tiered approach to pain management in cats and dogs for acute and chronic pain. Tiers are presented from highest recommendation (most evidence for effectiveness) to lowest, although all therapies presented have some evidence to support their use. Physical modalities include laser therapy, pulsed electromagnetic eld therapy, acupunc- ture, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Surgical procedures for chronic pain include top-tier treatments such as dental proce-dures, removal of painful lesions, joint stabilization and replacement, and amputation; lower-tier (salvage) procedures including arthrodesis,denervation, and Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 67Acute pain of initial causeAcute pain of Cold nursing careOmega-3s, environmental modifications, encouraging activity, weight optimization, surgeryOmega-3s, environmental modifications, exercise, weight optimization, surgery1ST TIER All other treatments require a diagnosis and/or more information on the health status of the patient prior to prescribing additional modalitiesKetamine, a-2s Tramadol TramadolAmantadine, drug therapiesAmantadine, Gabapentin, PSGAGs, TCAs, steroids, disease specific drug therapies (No additional drugs recommended)Physical modalities Anti- inflammatory dietsNon-Omega-3 nutritional supplements, salvage stem cells), non-Omega-3 supplements, ambulation assistance (braces, wheelchairs, slings), salvage surgery2ND TIERPhysical and rehabilitation; radiation; disease specific therapies Non-pharmacological Legend Pharmacological High burden on owner High impactAcute Pain of Known Cause (e.g., Perioperative Pain) An appropriate starting point for every surgery is to plan on using opioids, an NSAID, and local anesthetics, in addition to cold ther- apy47and appropriate nursing care.48,49Local anesthetics are the most effective analgesic available in small animal practice, and they should be used in every surgery. Recently, there has been an increase in information available on the practical use of local anesthetics in practice.50-53NSAIDs may not be appropriate for every patient, and consideration needs to be given to whether they are provided priorto or after surgery. 54,55Opioids are very effective for perioperative pain56and have proven preemptive bene t.5Cold therapy is very effective and can be applied by owners.47Nursing care includes appropriate use of bandages (which may mean not using them incats), care of IV lines and other invasive monitoring, gentle massage and range of motion exercise where appropriate, and ensuring ani- mals are able to sleep. Ketamine and a2-adrenoceptor agonists are good analgesic drugs but are in tier 2 to indicate that in general, they should be used after the use of NSAIDs, opioids, and local anes- thetics has been considered. There is relatively little in the way of therapeutics with a novel mechanism of action on the horizon for perioperative pain control, but the use of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) agonists (e.g., capsa- icin) holds some promise as a novel approach to augmenting periop- erative pain management.57,58 Although there is currently limited of ef cacy of physi- cal modalities (laser therapy,59pulsed electromagnetic eld ther- apy60), future work may change recommendations. Tier 3 contains additional options, including the use of anti- inflammatory diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids prior to and after sur- gery.61The tiered approach should be applied to the preoperative, intraoperative, immediate postoperative, and at-home time periods(Figure 3). Chronic Pain Dozens of treatments have been suggested as being effective forchronic pain, but there is little evidence of ef cacy for the majority of these. The tiered approach attempts to provide a ranking and isbased primarily on the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain.However, the principles are generally applicable across other chronic pain conditions. Future work will allow disease- or condition-speci c recommendations to be made. In tier 1 are the COX-inhibiting and non -COX-inhibiting (EP4 receptor antagonist) NSAIDs. These are predictably ef cacious across the wide range of pain conditions because of the ubiquitous role ofprostaglandins in peripheral and central pain processing. Other anal- gesics, such as the anti -nerve growth factor (NGF) monoclonalantibodies, are on the horizon and will provide additional rst-line choices. 62,63Nondrug treatment options in tier 1 include omega-3 fatty acids (either supplementing the diet or provided through the use of a therapeutic diet), encouraging activity, environmental modi- cation, weight management, and surgery. Measurable pain relief has been associated with the provision of diets enriched in omega-3fatty acids. 64,65Robust data in humans66,67and the limited data in companion animals68support the analgesic bene ts of moderate exercise. Modifying the environment is a very practical way of pro- viding relief from painful activities and facilitating movement. Pre- serving access to 3-D (vertical) space through building ramps orstairs is especially important for cats, who need access to height to feel safe. Lowering entry to litter boxes for cats, providing easy access to elimination for dogs, and optimizing floor and sleeping surfaces are other important aspects. Surgery is listed in tier 1 because partic-ular surgeries can remove chronically painful lesions (cancer resec- tions, dental procedures, joint stabilizations, and amputations). In tier 2 are adjunctive drugs \u2014those with little or mixed evi- dence of analgesic ef cacy in various conditions. These are recom- mended as \"adjunctive, \"or in addition to tier 1 approaches. In cases of intolerance or contraindications for NSAID use, ste- roids (cats and dogs) or acetaminophen (dogs only) can be tried asbroad \"base \"analgesics, despite the lack of data. Intra-articular (IA) steroids are recommended in tier 2, and var- ious IA biologics (such as platelet-rich plasma and stem cells) intier 3, based on current data. IA treatments are less practical in cats than in dogs. Some pain conditions in cats (e.g., interstitial cystitis)may bene t from tricyclic antidepressants. 69Disease-speci cd r u g and other therapeutic therapies (e.g., bisphosphonates and palliativeradiation for osteosarcoma pain) should be considered in tier 2 as appropriate for the disease. Therapeutic exercise and physical modal- ities such as acupuncture, laser therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and pulsed electromagnetic eld therapy may be useful adjuncts to consider, but little work has been performed toevaluate their bene t in chronic pain. Tramadol is listed in tier 3 given the demonstrated lack of ef cacy in dogs 33and the strong aversion cats have to its taste, despite a poten- tial therapeutic effect.70,71The placement of nutritional supplements in tier 3 indicates that there is no evidence to support an analgesic effectof non -omega-3 nutritional supplements. 72Procedures such as local- ized surgical denervation should be considered end-stage procedures. Pharmacologic Update The pharmaceutical toolbox continues to grow and improve forcompanion animals. This section of the guidelines discusses notable pharmacologic changes and discusses persistent myths by drug class. 68 JAAHA | 58:2 Mar/Apr 2022Pharmacological Agents in the Treatment of Acute or Perioperative Pain Although most opioids are in common use in veterinary species, they do not generally carry species-speci c licenses in the United States. Simbadol is a recent exception. It is a buprenorphine formula-tion licensed for use in cats as an every-24-hour subcutaneous injec-tion. 73,74Recent studies also support its use in dogs,73-75although it is not licensed for canine use. The 24-hour duration of action helps in providing pain relief to animals that are discharged into the home environment. A persistent myth surrounding opioid use in cats isthe belief that they create excessive hyperactivity or dysphoria at clin-ical doses in cats. They do not, unless very high doses are adminis-tered. 76Aj u s t i ed belief is that hyperthermia can be potentiated with opioids in cats, but this can be managed with monitoring and environmental modi cation.77 Newer drugs of the NSAID class include the expanded periop- erative approval of robenacoxib in dogs and cats. Robenacoxib was initially released for 3 days of perioperative use in cats using oral tab-lets, and since 2015, the injectable solution is now also approved. 78 Robenacoxib is now also licensed for perioperative use in dogs.79,80 Local anesthetic techniques have hit a new renaissance, with the promotion of their use in the dental college, increased availability of detailed descriptions of how to effectively use them,52,81and the development of more advanced methods to ensure reliable place- ment, such as nerve-location devices and ultrasound.50,51An e w l y available long-acting bupivacaine has added further momentum.82,83 The recently available long-acting preparation of bupivacaine is aliposome-encapsulated formulation, Nocita. When injected into thewound at the end of surgery, this agent can provide local analgesia that lasts up to 3 days. It is labeled for orthopedic surgery in dogs and onychectomy in cats. Opioids have been shown to have varyinglevels of independent sodium-channel blockage and to augment local blocks, with buprenorphine being a potent sodium-channel channel antagonist. 84,85Dexmedetomidine has also been shown to prolong local anesthetic blockade, likely from pharmacologic synergy as well as local vasoconstriction.86Our knowledge of the ef cacy of local anesthetic drugs other than lidocaine and bupivacaine has recently expanded. Ropivacaine is pharmacologically similar to bupivacaine but with an increased safety pro le in humans, and it was recently shown to be similar in ef cacy to bupivacaine.87Recent data have also con rmed ef cacy of intra- peritoneal or without local tissue inltration.87,89 -91 a2-Agonists have a variety of perioperative roles, including adrenergic-based analgesia, mitigation of vasodilation, reduced sym- pathetic out flow, and augmentation of sedation. Over the last 10 years, no new drugs in this class have emerged, but different usesand formulations of existing a2-agonists have. Intraoperative micro- infusions are being used to provide additional analgesia and improve respiratory and hemodynamic function.92 Tramadol was once a reflexively used oral analgesic in dogs, but it has been seriously deemphasized in the last decade. Oral tramadol has not been shown to be effective postoperatively in dogs.93 Studies of IV tramadol have shown some mixed efcacy for surgical pain in dogs.94-96 Injectable tramadol has shown perioperative efcacy in the cat97; however, an IV form of tramadol is not available in the United States. Gabapentin use has become widespread and common, although without supporting data, especially in chronic pain conditions (as described in the next section). It has not been shown to be effective for acute pain in dogs.98,99 The NK receptor system is bound by substance P and was stud- ied for years as a possible target for analgesia. Although these studies failed, the NK receptor antagonists have been found to be excellent antiemetics. Maropitant has become very popular in veterinary medi- cine as an antiemetic but also to provide some visceral analgesia. Studies showing analgesia are limited and weak,100 but the antiemetic qualities of maropitant are well established. Pharmacological Agents in the Treatment of Chronic Pain Long-term use of oral opioids is not recommended for chronic pain control. There are concerns about the potential for human abuse of these drugs, and dogs have demonstrated repeatedly poor uptake of opioids via the oral route because of pronounced enterohepatic recir- culation and elimination. No opioid-type drug shows reasonable, repeatable drug levels after oral administration; opioids combined with acetaminophen also provide inadequate analgesia for chronic pain.101 There are several NSAIDs approved for use for chronic pain in dogs. Although renal, hepatic, and gastrointestinal toxicity can be associated with their use, the true incidence is likely low (and unknown).102 Studies of long-term use of NSAIDs in dogs do not show increased organ-based toxicity with longer treatment but do show a positive trend toward increased efcacy.103 Since 2016, grapiprant (Galliprant) has been approved in the United States for managing chronic pain in dogs. Grapiprant is the rst \"piprant\" NSAID, that is, NSAIDs that block prostaglandin receptors. Grapiprant blocks the EP4 receptor, leaving the production of prostaglandins unaltered. It has been shown to be efcacious for canine OA pain104 and to have a favora ble safety prole. Grapiprant decreased the clinical signs of OA safely and effectively in a study of 131 dogs.104 No NSAID is approved for long-term use in cats in the United States, although both meloxicam and robenacoxib (Onsior) are approved for long-term control of musculoskeletal pain in the 2022 AAHA Pain Management Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 69or in patients intolerant of effective systemic treatments. There is emerging evidence for the ef cacy of IA treatments (such as cortico- steroids, hyaluronic acid, and orthobiologics [including platelet-richplasma and stem cell therapy] in dogs), 117,118although most studies are small and results have been mixed. Options continue to beexpanded, and most recently, a radioisotope of Tin-117m has been developed and found safe in normal elbow joints. 119Other effective options, such as the TRPV1 agonists (capsaicin and resiniferatoxin),appear to be on the horizon. 120,121 Nonpharmacologic Modalities for Pain Management Although pharmacological agents are often necessary to assist with managing discomfort,nonpharmacological modalities are critically important in the management of chronic pain and maintaining the body in an active state. Thus, it is advisable for veterinarians to be prepared with substantiated options. Weight Optimization Adipose tissue secretes a mixture of cytokines that circulate through- out the body, contributing to the pathology of many diseases, includ- ing OA, other in flammatory conditions, and the pain-associated hypersensitization process. Studies in human medicine have linkedobesity with increased progression of OA in weight-bearing joints as well as non -weight-bearing joints, meaning these cytokines play an important role in the degradation process. Longitudinal cohort stud- ies in the veterinary literature strongly support maintenance of a leanbody condition score (caloric restriction over the lifetime of the dog) for decreasing the rate of OA progression and extending life span. 122,123With respect to pain, obesity is most often linked to OA pain, but, increasingly, it is becoming apparent that an obese statecontributes to other pain conditions, such as neuropathic pain. 124 Dietary Modulation As described above, caloric restriction assists in preventing obesity, and this has a positive effect on helping prevent painful disease, such as OA, and likely helps decrease pain associated with other condi- tions. Beyond calories, there has long been an interest in \"nutritional supplements\" for the management of pain, especially OA or degener- ative joint disease. The most comprehensive review on the ef cacy of nutraceuticals to alleviate the clinical signs of OA concluded that thestrength of evidence was low for all nutraceuticals except for omega- 3 fatty acid in dogs. 125 Exercise and Rehabilitation Therapy The profound health bene ts of movement and exercise are well established in human medicine, including the bene ts of exercise in reducing and controlling pain.66,67,126The strength of these data inUnited Kingdom, elsewhere in Europe, and in other parts of the world. Recent studies have conrmed the efcacy of both drugs for treating OA pain in cats.14,18 Large studies of the clinical safety of robenacoxib have been published and demonstrate its safety in older cats, even those with chronic kidney disease.105 Arece ntreviewemph asized thatfears over the long-term use of NSAIDs in cats, including those with chronic kidney disease, are not fully justied.106 NGF has been shown to be an important driver of pain in OA.107 Studies have shown good pain relief with anti-NGF monoclonal antibodies in dogs108,109 and cats.62,63 The rst anti-NGF monoclonal antibodies have been approved in the United Kingdom, elsewhere in Europe, and in other countries. Anti-NGF monoclonal antibody treat- ment was recently approved in the United States for use in cats. Amantadine is the oral counterpart to ketamine. More than 10 years ago, amantadine was shown to be useful in combination with NSAIDs for the treatment of chronic OA pain,110 although no new data are available. Although once-daily doses were used in that study, pharmacokinetic studies in greyhounds suggest that twice-daily doses may bemo reappr opriate,111 but this has not yet been evaluated in efcacy studies. There is a perception that amantadine should be dosed as a 3-week rescue protocol. However, this assertion is merely a result of the duration of administration in the original study.110 Gabapentin has become the \"new tramadol, \" with widespread usage. While some practitioners report benets anecdotally in both species and for a variety of pain conditions, virtually no supporting data are available at this time. It has not been evaluated for analgesic efcacy in chronic pain in dogs. Limited data indicate some efcacy in cats with OA pain,112 although sedation was noted, and indeed, treated cats moved less (as measured by activity monitor output). There is evidence to support its use as a behavioral modi er or stress reducer in cats when given several hours prior to hospital visits.113 This application may help with chronic pain control in cats by facili- tating veterinary visits and evaluations. The endocannabinoid system is intrinsically integrated with the more traditionally studied systems (opioidergic, serotonergic, norad- renergic), and the scienti c feasibility of benets on pain sensation and other homeostatic systems is undeniable. However, the data required for evidence-guided prescriptions of cannabinoid com- pounds in veterinary medicine are lacking. Some efcacy studies have been performed, with both mixed114 and negative115 results. The eld is complicated by the lack of regulation and quality control from a regulatory body such as the FDA. There are few data on the efcacy of acetaminophen, but it was recently shown to be inferior to carprofen for OA when combined with hydrocodone.116 IA and intralesional injections of analgesics can be useful when the pain, particularly chronic, is localized to one or two limited areas 70 JAAHA | 58:2 Mar/Apr 2022humans suggests that the same is highly likely to be true for cats and dogs, although clinical study evidence is sparse. However, daily walk- ing has been associated with a decrease in the severity of lameness indogs with hip dysplasia. 68Whereas the terms physiotherapy and physical therapy refer to the treatment of humans, the most appro-priate terminology in veterinary medicine is rehabilitation therapy.Rehabilitation therapy broadly encompasses the use of varied manual techniques (joint mobilization, passive range of motion, stretching, massage, and myofascial release, to name a few), treatment modali-ties (therapeutic ultrasound, photobiomodulation-laser therapy, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, neuromuscular electrical stimula- tion, and thermal modi cation of tissue), and therapeutic exercises including hydrotherapy. Although there is a dearth of controlled prospective clinical trials in the veterinary literature, the advisory panel believes thatrehabilitation therapy should be considered part of a comprehensive wellness plan for patients who are affected by acute or chronic pain. \"Therapeutic exercise \"usually refers to speci ce x e r c i s et a r g e t - ing particular goals, such as restoring range of motion in arthritic joints, building muscle following surgery or prolonged immobility, or retraining the proprioceptive system after neurological injury. Creative planning between an owner and a trained rehabilitation spe-cialist can often yield at-home alternatives to buying speci ca n i m a l tness equipment. Cold Therapy Cold therapy has a long history as an analgesic modality for acute pain. Applying cold therapy to skin decreases temperature up to adepth of 2 -4 cm, resulting in decreased activation of tissue nocicep- tors and slowed conduction velocity along peripheral axons. 127Cold therapy also decreases edema formation via vasoconstriction,decreased delivery of in flammatory mediators to injured tissues, and decreased neurogenic in flammation as a result of decreased neuronal activity in sensory nerves. The practical application of cold therapyto patients was recently reviewed, and its use in acute and chronic pain conditions was discussed. 47 Several studies in veterinary medicine have demonstrated that cryotherapy or cold compression therapy applied with the rst 72 hours following sti fle stabilization surgery resulted in decreased pain, decreased lameness, and increased joint range of motion.128 Environmental Modification Environmental modi cation is the adjustment of environmental sur- roundings to positively in fluence comfort. In the hospital environ- ment, this can be as simple as separating cats from dogs, placing pets in appropriately sized cages or runs, providing cage pads in additionto bedding, and having hiding places for cats. Reducing noise candecrease stimulation and secretion of cortisol, which can reduce patient stress. 129 At home, environmental modi cation can also be used to pre- serve access to preferred areas. Owners can provide injured, arthritic,or neurologic pets with secure footing (carpet runners) or with ramps or steps to areas that would otherwise be inaccessible. Animals in discomfort often feel vulnerable and prefer to rest in areas of the house that are quieter or more protected, such as a behind a couch or under a bed. Cat doors or baby gates can be used to provide \"restricted access \"areas in the home and allow pets to rest more comfortably. Placing these areas at a manageable distance from foodor litter boxes may encourage mobility and exercise, particularly forcats. Acupuncture There is not an abundance of evidence-guided studies supporting the use of acupuncture. However, a 1997 National Institutes of Health Consensus Statement indicated promising results for the use of acu- puncture in humans postoperatively, for treating chemotherapy nau- sea and vomiting, and in cases of postoperative dental pain. In theveterinary literature, acupuncture has been reported to be helpful as an adjunct treatment for postoperative pain following ovariohyster- ectomy in cats 130and dogs and for managing intervertebral disc dis- ease, but it was not found to be bene cial for the treatment of pain associated with OA in dogs.131Further work is needed to fully de ne t h er o l eo fa c u p u n c t u r ei np a i nc o n t r o l . Feline-Specific Factors in Pain Management Cats living today have essentially the same brains and behavioral rep-ertoire as their wild ancestors; they have just learned how to form social attachments to people when kept in con nement with them. 132Cats bene t from safe and predictable environments that permit their perception of control to exceed their perception of threat. Such environments include the people to whom cats are bonded. Cats respond to human communication and emotional cues, particularly when expressed by their owners. Signi cant differ- ences in feline threat response system activity have been found whenattending to human \"happiness \"or\"anger \"emotional signals. For these reasons, effective chronic pain management plans include consideration of the human-cat bond as well as the effective- ness of medical interventions. Research in other species has shown that positive environments and emotions decrease pain behaviors and that negative ones have the opposite effect. 133Thus, the treat- ment plan must minimize negative interactions with owners andcaregivers, such as unpleasant-tasting medications or unskilled han- Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 71The bene ts of any treatment should be weighed against the potential costs to the cat' s comfort, including any treatments that require restraint or repeated trips to the veterinarian. For example, whereas therapeutic laser treatments may be a tolerable and effectiveform of therapy, the necessity for repeated transportation for treat-ment may limit their effectiveness for many cats. For medications, alternative formulations like compounded liquids, very small tablets, or preferred flavors may help reduce the dif culty of administration. The value of treatments that cause anxiety, fear, or frustration whenadministered must always be weighed against their negative conse-quences on the human-cat bond. Conversely, humans initiating and maintaining contact with cats in their homes in ways that result in positive emotional states can reduce pain-related behaviors and improve animal welfare. Pre- dictable interactions with humans reduce the cat 's perception of threat. And the ability to choose likely permits cats to increase theirperception of control. 134Choice in the timing and duration of play sessions and activities such as petting, grooming, or training, com-bined with high-value treats, should ideally be planned for predict- able times of the day and can reduce pain-related behavior. 135 Ac a t 's perception of threat also can be reduced by increasing opportunities to express feline-speci cb e h a v i o r s ,s u c ha se x p l o r a t i o n and play, by providing stimulating feeding strategies, and by reduc- ing or eliminating con flict. Humans are part of this, whereas unre- lated cats are not. Cats also rely more than humans do on smell,hearing, and touch to experience the world. For example, cats com- monly use scent to mate, mark territory, bond, and communicate. Thus, odors preferred by cats, such as catnip, silvervine, or a phero-mone, can add to enrichment. Additionally, cat-speci c music has been shown to reduce blood pressure in cats, 136and preferred bed- ding materials, fabrics, and scratching surface textures can enhancetactile experiences. Effective chronic pain treatment plans should always include environment and emotional enrichment as integral components. Roles and Responsibilities for the Practice Team Every member of the practice team has a potential role in imple- menting a culture that supports pain management strategies forcanine and feline patients. It is extremely important that each staff member understands their respective role and responsibilities in the practice 's integrated approach to pain management. In order to accomplish this, team members should be given role-speci ci n s t r u c - tions and training for applying an appropriate pain managementplan individualized for each patient. Delegation of each role will varybased on a particular practice 's needs. Important roles for team members are as follows:/C15Providing pain-related continuing education for the team. /C15Attending pain-related continuing education. /C15Developing hospital-speci c materials from the AAHA toolbox. /C15Holding consistent meetings/communication across the team to dis- cuss pain management assessment and protocols. /C15Scheduling pain-related appointments. /C15Implementing speci c, consistent discharges in relation to pain management plans. /C15Communicating low-stress handling with owners and use of antian-xiolytic medications prescribed by veterinarian. /C15Conducting pain clinics. /C15Implementing an acute pain scale and providing in-house educationon its use. /C15Facilitating pain-related medication, diet, and therapeutic re lls. /C15Evaluating patients for any pain postures or signs noted upon arrival, at check-in, or during history taking. Client Education, Instructions, and Follow-up With each pain management plan, it is important that the client be given speci c instructions, both verbally and in writing, including when the next assessment is recommended. Where owners play acritical role, such as in the provision of cold therapy following sur-gery or in weight management and exercise for chronic joint pain,they should be given clear instructions and guidance in the mediumbest suited to them (e.g., digital versus paper). As treatment pro-gresses and pain control improves, modi cations to instructions should be made clearly and in full consultation with the owner. It isimportant that owners be made aware of potential adverse drugeffects and of the action to take if these are seen. Especially for cats, technicians should provide a hands-on demonstration on how to administer medications and handle the pet at home. Compliance will improve if the pet owner understands the treatment schedule, a demonstration is given, video links are pro-vided, and technicians actively engage in follow-up at regular inter-vals. Clients should be encouraged to address their concerns aboutthe pet 's condition and treatment plan via email, phone, or follow- up consultations. Finally, providing pet owners with quality, accessi-ble online or in-person education will foster client goodwill andimprove compliance and patient care as owners are welcomed aspart of the management team. Top 5 messages for effective pain management 1. Be proactive: train and prepare the whole veterinary team to understand and appreciate the procedures and diseases that can be associated with pain and to proac- tively manage diseases early in their course. 2. Use the tools and recommendations available to facili- tate and assist with the assessment of pain. 3. Engage the owner as a team member in both the rec- ognition and management of pain. 72 JAAHA | 58:2 Mar/Apr 20224. Practice preemptive, multimodal management based on a tiered approach to both pharmacological and non- pharmacological treatments. 5. Reevaluate patients on a regular basis, and adjust treat- ment plans accordingly. Summary It is helpful to view pain management as a continuum of care, a sequence consisting of assessment, treatment, reassessment, and plan modi cation. Using tools and approaches known to be valid meas- ures, clinicians can diagnose acute and chronic pain and the patient 's response to treatment with a high degree of assurance. The broad assortment of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic modalities for treating pain gives veterinarians considerable flexibility in developing ap a t i e n t - s p e c i c treatment plan. In using these therapeutic tools, preemptive analgesia and, whenever appropriate, multimodal therapy are two underlying principles of effective and judicious pain management. The client plays an important role in pain management by pro- viding relevant patient history, participating in assessment and reas- sessment of the patient, and adhering to treatment recommenda- tions, including administering treatment and management recommendations in the home environment. Practices that imple- ment an integrated approach to pain management ensure that all healthcare team members and their clients understand their respec- tive roles in preventing and controlling pain in their patients and pets. This shared responsibility ensures that effective pain manage- ment will be a central feature of compassionate care for every patient.
