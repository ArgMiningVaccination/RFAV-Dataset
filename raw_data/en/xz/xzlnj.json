Although antibiotics are generally an effective treatment for Lyme disease after an immediate tick bite, some people are left with long-lasting symptoms. About [10%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4847307/) of people who undergo antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease experience further symptoms ( [Post Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome](https://igenex.com/tick-talk/what-is-post-treatment-lyme-disease-syndrome/)). Not to mention antibiotics can come with their own side effects as well. Others may never realize they were bit by a tick and go on for years without proper diagnosis, which can cause the untreated disease to develop into a chronic condition. Some common symptoms of PTLDS and chronic Lyme disease include: - Joint pain - Extreme fatigue - Pain and swelling in large joints like the knees and elbows - Difficulty with cognition including memory and concentration People with chronic Lyme disease may benefit from looking outside the traditional medical model to find relief from symptoms and help boost their immune system. We've helped to explain some natural remedies for Lyme disease to help you or your loved one navigate the discomfort that comes with this disease. However, note that the information about natural Lyme disease treatment in this article does not constitute medical advice. Rather, it is simply a collection of anecdotal information reported by some patients. You should always consult with your doctor before pursuing any kind of Lyme treatment, whether it includes natural remedies for Lyme disease or not. The Holistic Approach You've probably heard the term \"holistic\" thrown around in the natural medicine community. Holistic simply means to treat the whole body, instead of looking at it as compartmentalized symptoms. In line with this thinking, some people advocate for using allopathic medicine tools with natural Lyme disease treatment to help best treat symptoms using multiple approaches. Although some people have found relief with these treatments, many do not yet have much scientific evidence to back them up. With that in mind, keep reading to learn about the natural treatments that some Lyme disease patients have tried. Supplements When it comes to natural treatments, supplements are often the easiest to access and the first remedy that people try out. Most supplements are available online or at natural health food stores and typically have a low risk of side effects. Some people with Lyme disease have reported benefits from taking [supplements](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2722197/) including: - Magnesium - Grape Seed extract - Vitamin B-complex - Omega 3 fatty acids (fish oil) - Probiotics - Mushroom extract - Turmeric - Olive leaf - Vitamin C [Coenzyme Q10](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/11/4/667/htm) Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Many of the beneficial nutrients found in supplements can also be found in food. Many patients with Lyme disease pursue relief through dietary changes. Eating a diet that helps combat inflammation may be incredibly helpful for people who experience arthritic symptoms, joint pain, neck stiffness, and more. A beneficial diet for Lyme disease may look like this: - Healthy fats like avocado, extra virgin olive oil, and nuts - Fresh fruits and vegetables - Fish like sardines, tuna, and salmon - Beans and other legumes - Plenty of fiber You may want to limit these foods: - Excess alcohol - Added sugar - Processed foods Some Lyme patients also make other lifestyle changes aimed at lowering stress levels, getting enough sleep, and getting regular physical activity. Bee Products and Venom Therapy It may seem extreme, but one remedy that has a long history in countries like Korea, Germany, China, and Switzerland is [bee venom therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6720840/#:~:text=Bee%20venom%20therapy%20(BVT)%20is,for%20more%20than%205000%20years.). This is the use of bee venom either applied directly through bee stings or diluted in water or saline solution. Used as a [treatment for Lyme disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29186026/), some people report improvements in symptoms like joint pain, fatigue, and cognition. [Royal jelly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK580274/), the milk-like secretion that is used to feed larvae in the honeycomb, is another potential bee tool for Lyme disease thanks to its high content of proteins, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and more. Natural Medicine Practitioners Another option that some patients pursue is seeing a natural medicine practitioner who uses comprehensive tools to help treat Lyme disease and its symptoms. These include practitioners of [acupuncture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7505341/) or Traditional Chinese Medicine, naturopathic medicine, and Ayurvedic medicine. Radiation and Energy Therapy Another [natural remedy](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/60/12/1776/2462643) for Lyme disease is the use of magnets, heat, lasers, and light. Photon therapy, for example, is done using an at-home device that claims it forces pathogens out of the cells as light is injected in, leaving a stronger immune system. Some other tools that utilize radiation and energy are steam rooms, infrared saunas, and low-intensity or \"cold\" laser therapy. Essential Oils One [study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2017.00169/full) found that certain essential oils were effective in killing the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, B. burgdorferi. However, note that this study was done in a laboratory setting, so the results might not be the same in actual infections in humans. Some of the essential oils that were found effective are oregano, cinnamon bark, and clove bud. Essential oils have antibacterial properties since they are incredibly concentrated liquids made from plants. Because they are so concentrated, they are not safe to consume in large quantities, and should only be inhaled through a diffuser or diluted in a carrier oil. Ask Your Provider Again, these treatments are not a replacement for medical treatment. If you're experiencing possible symptoms of Lyme disease, it's important to seek comprehensive diagnostic testing as soon as possible through services like those at [IGeneX](https://igenex.com/disease/borrelia/), and ask your medical provider before trying any natural remedy.
