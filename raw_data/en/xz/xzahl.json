The specific conditions and treatments include but are not limited to: - Receiving active cancer treatment for tumors or cancers of the blood - Received an organ transplant and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system - Received a stem cell transplant in the last 2 years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system - Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (such as common variable immunodeficiency, DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome) - Active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that may suppress your immune response (for example: azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, adalimumab, etanercept) - Advanced or untreated HIV infection People who are immunocompromised are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 because they are more at risk of serious, prolonged illness, and may benefit from an additional dose to make sure they have enough protection against COVID-19. The CDC recommendation applies to immunocompromised people who received one of the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) and not the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine (J&J). Cambridge residents who have questions about whether a third dose of vaccine is recommended should contact their medical provider to discuss these recommendations.
