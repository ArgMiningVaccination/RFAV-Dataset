Nearly 7,000 people had an 'adverse event' after being given either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the Moderna shot, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( [CDC](/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html)) revealed on Friday. However, fewer than 10 percent of patients had a reaction like anaphylactic shock that was classified as 'serious' by the agency's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). What's more, around 1.5 percent of people died after being immunized between mid-December and mid-January, but two-thirds of these deaths occurred among long-term care facility residents, most of whom had underlying conditions. As of Friday, more than 57.7 million people in the U.S. have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Of 6,994 adverse events following coronavirus vaccination, a total of 90.8% reactions were classified as non-serious such as a headache and chills after the Pfizer vaccine (above), a new CDC report found The remaining 9.2% were classified as serious with reactions such as anaphylactic shock. Pictured: Non-serious reactions reported after the Moderna vaccine There were 113 reported deaths, but two-thirds occurred among long-term care facility residents, most with underlying conditions.

During this period, the first and second doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the first dose of Moderna vaccine were being administered. Over the course of a month, there were 13,794,904 vaccine doses administered, and 6,994 reports of adverse events that were submitted to VAERS. This means just 0.05 percent of all patients during this time experienced some type of reaction. About 98 percent were among people not living in long-term care facilities. Of those reports, 90.8 percent, or 6,354, were classified as non-serious while the remaining 9.2 percent, or 640, were classified as serious. PFIZER VACCINE SIDE EFFECTS British regulators are advising that anyone who has a history of 'significant' allergic reactions to medicines, food or vaccines should not get the Pfizer coronavirus jab. Allergic reactions to the vaccine are 'very rare', according to the trials involving more than 40,000 people. Pfizer found a 'very small number' during its phase three clinical studies, or 137 out of 19,000 people who got the vaccine. But 111 people who were given a placebo also had allergic reactions. They also identified 12 possible side-effects from the vaccine, with seven identified as 'very common' meaning they are likely to affect more than one in ten people. Below are the known side effects. The patient safety leaflet for the vaccine cautions that anyone with an allergy to any of the active substances in the vaccine should not receive the jab. Allergic reactions to the vaccine are: Very common (Likely to affect more than one in ten people) - Pain at injection site - Tiredness - Muscle pain - Chills - Joint pain - Fever - Headache Common (Likely to affect up to one in ten people) - Injection site swelling - Redness at injection site - Nausea Uncommon (May affect one in 100 people) - Enlarged lymph nodes - Feeling unwell The majority of the reports - more than three-quarters - occurred in women. However, this may be due to the fact that frontline healthcare workers were among the first to be vaccinated, most of whom are female. The most common side effect reported from either vaccine was headache, which was experienced by 22.4 percent of patients. This was closely followed by fatigue and dizziness, which was reported by 16.5 percent of patients each. Other symptoms included myalgia, chills, fever, injection site swelling, joint pain and nausea - most of which disappeared after seven days. During this time period, there were sixty-two confirmed cases of a life-threatening allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. Anaphylactic shock is a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction to an allergy from food, medicine or even a type of material. The immune system releases chemicals that flood the body, blood pressure suddenly drops, and airways narrow, which prevents someone from breathing normally. Symptoms usually occur within minutes and include hives, a weak pulse, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and a swollen tongue or throat. If not treated immediately, it can lead to death. Of the 62 cases, 74.2 percent occurred after patients were given the Pfizer vaccine and 16 cases after receipt of the Moderna vaccine. Previous reports from the CDC have indicated this reaction is more common in the Pfizer vaccine, although why is unclear. The CDC says the rate of the life-threatening allergic reaction is 4.5 cases of per million doses compared with one case per million for the flu. About 1.6 percent of patients, a total of 113, died after receiving the vaccine. Of the total, there were 35 serious reports of death among non-long term care facility residents. Record collection is ongoing but the CDC has reviewed 16 death certificates or other data indicating underlying heart disease, cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and otherwise frail health as the causes of death. The remaining 78 deaths occurred in patients living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. A total of 57.7 million people have received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine, with an average of 1.6 million and 1.7 million being vaccinated every day Currently, 41 million people - 12.5% of the U.S. population have received one dose while 16.1 million people - 4.9% - are fully immunized Forty-two were in residents in hospice care or with a do-not-resuscitate status while another 17 had death certificates with causes of death including cardiac disease, dementia, pneumonia, and failure to thrive. The CDC says the findings show that reactions to the vaccine were rare with no unusual or unexpected reporting patterns detected. 'Health care providers and vaccine recipients can be reassured about the safety of Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines,' the authors wrote. 'Counseling vaccine recipients to expect transient local and systemic reactions might ease concerns and encourage completion of the 2-dose vaccination series.' According to the CDC's tracker, a total of 57.7 million people have received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine. About 41 million people - 12.5 percent of the population have received one dose while 16.1 million people - 4.9 percent - are fully immunized. Between 1.6 million and 1.7 people are being vaccinated every day, and President Joe Biden is on track to reach his goal of 100 million shots in arms in his first 100 days in office.
