There are fourteen main meridians, along which are the acu- points, of which there are several hundred. very fine needles are quickly inserted into various points on the body, and are stimulated, normally by the practitioner gently twiddling the needles, this creates a momentary sensation called De Qi. During the centuries of clinical practice, and research the functions and clinical effectiveness of each acu-point or combinations of points in treating different diseases have been studied in detail. In recent years these actions have been systematically studied and verified by modern scientific research. Currently, there are several of forms of acupuncture practised throughout the world. In the West medical acupuncture is commonly practiced by doctors, physiotherapists and chiropractors. This form of acupuncture, sometimes called dry needling, tends to be symptomatic and is normally used as an adjunct to other therapies. The training tends to be quite short and the application of medical acupuncture is normally limited to pain relief. our members practice traditional Chinese acupuncture which is based on the full TCM meridian and collateral and the syndrome differentiation theories.
