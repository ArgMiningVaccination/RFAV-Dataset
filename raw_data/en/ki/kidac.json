The AAAAI and ACAAI have jointly accepted responsibil- ity for establishing ''Adverse reactions to vaccines practiceparameter 2012 update.'' This is a complete and comprehen- sive document at the current time. The medical environment is a changing environment, and not all recommendations will beappropriate for all patients. Because this document incorpo- rates the efforts of many participants, no single individual, including those who served on the JTFPP, is authorized toprovide an ofcial AAAA I or ACAAI interpretation of these practice parameters. Any request for information about or aninterpretation of these practice parameters by the AAAAI orACAAI should be directed to the Executive Ofces of theAAAAI, the ACAAI, and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. The JTFPP understands that the cost of diagnostic tests and therapeutic agents is an important concern that might appro-priately influence the workup and treatment chosen for a given patient. The emphasis of our primary recommendationsregarding a medication can vary, for example, depending on third-party payer issues and product patent expiration dates. However, because a given test or agent's cost is so widelyvariable and there is a paucity of pharmacoeconomic data, theJTFPP generally does not consider cost when formulatingpractice parameter recommendations. In extraordinary circum- stances, when the cost benet of an intervention is prohibitive as supported by pharmacoeconomic data, commentary might beprovided. These parameters are not designed for use by pharmaceutical companies in drug promotion. The Joint Task Force is committed to ensuring that the practice parameters are based on the best scientic evidence that is free of commercial bias. To this end, the parameter develop- ment process includes multiple layers of rigorous review. Theselayers include the work group convened to draft the parameter, the task force reviewers, and peer review by members of each sponsoring society. Although the Task Force has the nalresponsibility for the content of the documents submitted for publication, each reviewer's comment will be discussed, and reviewers will receive written responses to comments whenappropriate. To preserve the greatest transparency regarding potential conflicts of interest, all members of the Joint Task Force andthe Practice Parameters Work Groups will complete a standardpotential conflict of interest disclosure form, which will be available for external review by the sponsoring organization and any other interested individual.

Anaphylactic reactions to vaccines are rare and should be evaluated with skin tests tothe vaccine and its components. If the skin test results are negative, subsequent doses can be administered in the usual manner but under observation. If the skin test results arepositive and the patient requires subsequent doses, the vaccine can be administered in graded doses under observation. Some nonanaphylactic reactions to vaccines might also require eval-uation, but only a few are contraindications to future doses. Pregnant women and persons who are immune compromised should generally not receive live vaccines. Purported long-termsequelae of vaccination, such as autism, are not supported byepidemiologic studies. Patients with egg allergy of any severity should receive annual influenza vaccinations because studies have demonstrated a very low rate of reactions. Studies to datehave evaluated the injectable trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV), and thus TIV, rather than the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), should be used for recipients with egg allergy. Allinfluenza vaccines available in the United States contain low amounts of ovalbumin. Neither skin testing with the vaccine nor dividing the dose is required; however, the vaccine should beadministered in a setting in which anaphylaxis can be recog- nized and treated. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Mild local reactions and constitutional symptoms, such as fever, after vaccinations are common and do not contraindicate future doses. Rarely, delayed-type hypersensitivity to a vaccineconstituent can cause an injection-site nodule, but this is not a contraindication to subsequent vaccination. Anaphylactic reac- tions to vaccines are estimated to occur at a rate of approximately1 per million doses. There are approximately 220 million doses ofvaccines distributed in the United States each year. All serious events occurring after vaccine administration should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), even ifit is not certain that the vaccine was the causal agent. Measuringlevels of IgG antibodies to the immunizing agents in a vaccinesuspected of causing a serious adverse reaction to determine whether they are at protective levels can help determine whether subsequent doses are required. All suspected anaphylactic reac-tions to vaccines should ideally be evaluated in an attempt to determine the culprit allergen. IgE-mediated reactions to vaccines are more often caused by additive or residual vaccine compo-nents, such as gelatin, rather than the microbial immunizing agentitself. Patients who have had an apparent anaphylactic reaction after immunization should undergo immediate-type allergy skin testing to help conrm that the reaction was IgE mediated and todetermine the responsible component of the vaccine. If the intradermal skin test result is negative, the chance that the patient has IgE antibodies to any vaccine constituent is negligible, and thevaccine can be administered in the usual manner. Nonetheless, it is prudent in a patient with a history suggestive of an anaphylactic reaction to administer the vaccine under observation with epi-nephrine and other treatment available. In a patient with a historyand skin test results consistent with an IgE-mediated reaction to a vaccine who requires additional doses of the suspect vaccine or other vaccines with common ingredients, consideration can begiven to administering the vaccine in graded doses under obser- vation. Some nonanaphylactic reactions to vaccines might also require evaluation, but only a few are absolute contraindicationsto future doses. Pregnant women should not be vaccinated with live vaccines. However, pregnant women should be given inactivated influenza vaccine, as well as tetanus and hepatitis Bvaccine, if otherwise indicated. In general, live vaccines should not be given to persons who are immune compromised because of a risk of generalized infection with the immunizing agent.Specic vaccines or vaccination in general have been purportedto have long-term consequences, including atopy, autism, and multiple sclerosis. Epidemiologic studies have not supported such associations. Patients with egg allergy should receive influenza vaccinations (TIV) because the risks of vaccinating are outweighed by the risksof not vaccinating. Persons with a history of suspected egg allergyshould be evaluated by an allergist to determine the status of their egg allergy, but this should not delay their influenza vaccination. A growing number of studies suggest that influenza vaccines canbe safely administered even to patients with a history of anaphy- laxis to egg ingestion. Skin testing (prick, intradermal, or both) with the influenza vaccine itself in subjects with egg allergy (butwithout a history of reacting to the vaccine itself) does not reliablyidentify patients who are at increased risk of reacting to the vaccine and is not recommended. Influenza vaccine can be administered as a single dose to patients with egg allergy. Patientswith egg allergy should receive influenza vaccines in a setting in which clinicians experienced in recognizing and treating ana- phylaxis and equipment to manage anaphylaxis are immediatelyavailable and should be observed for 30 minutes after vaccination. Patients with egg allergy with a history of only hives after egg ingestion can receive influenza vaccine in a primary careprovider's ofce provided the appropriate personnel and equip-ment are available, whereas those with a history of more severe reactions to egg ingestion should receive their vaccine in an allergist's ofce. All influenza vaccines available in the UnitedStates contain low amounts of ovalbumin. Although the intrana- sally administered LAIV contains a low amount of ovalbumin, all published studies to date have evaluated the injectable TIV, andthus TIV rather than LAIV should be used for recipients with eggCategory of evidence: Ia Evidence from meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials Ib Evidence from at least 1 randomized controlled trial IIa Evidence from at least 1 controlled study without randomization IIb Evidence from at least 1 other type of quasiexperimental study III Evidence from nonexperimental descriptive studies, such as comparative studies IV Evidence from expert committee reports or opinions or clinical experience of respected authorities or both Strength of recommendation: A Directly based on category I evidence B Directly based on category II evidence or extrapolated from category I evidence C Directly based on category III evidence or extrapolated from category I or II evidence D Directly based on category IV evidence or extrapolated from category I, II, or III evidence E Based on consensus of the Joint Task Force on Practice ParametersJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 130, NUMBER 1KELSO ET AL 27allergy. Only for patients with a history of allergic reaction to influenza vaccine itself is additional evaluation appropriate, including skin testing with the vaccine and vaccine ingredients. For patients with positive skin test results, the vaccine can beadministered in multiple divided doses or can be withheld. PREFACE This practice parameter provides a practical, peer-reviewed, evidence-based guide for evaluation and management of patientswith suspected allergic or other adverse reactions to vaccines. It also addresses patients with preexisting allergies or other health conditions that might preclude or alter vaccination. It containsupdates since the rst publication in 2009. The practice parameter offers both general and vaccine-specic recommendations for (1) skin testing to vaccines and compo-nents, (2) serum specic IgE antibody testing, (3) serologic testing for protective antibody responses to vaccines, (4) vaccine administration, and (5) avoidance. The guidelines should proveuseful for not only specialists in allergy and immunology but alsoother physicians. Most patients who avoid vaccination because of allergy concerns will be able to receive their appropriate vacci- nations if this practice parameter is followed. This parameter emphasizes that (1) patients with suspected allergy to vaccines or vaccine components should be evaluated byan allergist/immunologist and (2) most patients with suspectedallergy to vaccines can receive vaccination safely. Recommenda- tions regarding the administration of influenza vaccine to re-cipients with egg allergy are specically addressed in anaddendum at the end of this practice parameter. Immunization is perhaps the greatest public health achieve- ment of all time, 1having signicantly reduced the morbidity and mortality of many infectious diseases.2Routine immunization of children, adolescents, and adults provides substantial protection from a large number of infectious diseases. The current vaccina- tion schedules for children and adults are available at www.cdc. gov/vaccines/recs/schedules .3-5Patients who have experienced adverse reactions to vaccines might unnecessarily be advised toavoid subsequent immunization, which could have important ad-verse personal and population health consequences. 6-10Although there are some adverse reactions to vaccines that constitute abso-lute contraindications to administration of future doses, most suchreactions do not preclude subsequent immunization. 11Patients who have experienced an apparent allergic or other serious ad- verse reaction after receiving a vaccine warrant evaluation by an allergist/immunologist. Also, patients with preexisting healthconditions that might predispose to adverse reactions to vaccines could benet from such an evaluation. In most cases, a risk- benet analysis will favor subsequent immunization ( Fig 1 ). SUMMARY STATEMENTS Summary Statement 1: Mild local reactions and constitu- tional symptoms, such as fever, after vaccinations are com-mon and do not contraindicate future doses. Rarely, delayed-type hypersensitivity to a vaccine constituent can cause an injection-site nodule, but this is not a contraindica-tion to subsequent vaccination. (C) Local injection-site reactions (swelling, redness, and/or sore- ness) and constitutional symptoms, especially fever, are commonafter the administration of most vaccines and are not contraindi-cations to subsequent vaccination. 11Neomycin is contained inseveral vaccines.12For a delayed-type neomycin, the only anticipated reac- tion is a small temporary papule at the injection site,13,14and this is not a contraindication to subsequent vaccination.11Delayed- type hypersensitivity to thimerosal has also been reported.15Al- though patients with a positive patch test result for thimerosal can have large local reactions to vaccination with thimerosal-containing vaccines, 16,17most such patients do not.15,18-20Nei- ther a history of such reactions nor a positive patch test result to thimerosal is a contraindication to future vaccination.11There is a single case report of a generalized pruritic maculopapular rash attributed to thimerosal in an influenza vaccine.21 Aluminum-containing vaccines12rarely cause persistent nodules at the injection site, possibly because of delayed hypersensitivityor other immune responses to aluminum. 22-24 Summary Statement 2: Anaphylactic reactions to vaccines are estimated to occur at a rate of approximately 1 per milliondoses. There are approximately 220 million doses of vaccinesdistributed in the United States each year. (B) Anaphylaxis after vaccination is rare. The Vaccine Safety Datalink reviewed the diagnostic codes from medical encountersafter the administration of more than 7.5 million doses of vaccines and estimated the risk of anaphylaxis to be 0.65 to 1.53 per million doses. 25The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there were 220,717,119 doses of all vac- cines distributed in the United States in 2009, although not all doses are administered (John Iskander, CDC, written communica-tion, July 20, 2011). Thus there are calculated to be approximately 140 to 340 cases of vaccine-induced anaphylaxis in the United States annually. Fatalities from vaccine-induced anaphylaxis areexceedingly rare. 26 Summary Statement 3: All serious events occurring after vaccine administration should be reported to the Vaccine Ad-verse Event Reporting System, even if it is not certain that thevaccine was causal. (C) In 1990, the VAERS was established by the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration. 27The VAERS relies on reporting by health care professionals and parents or patients, and all seri- ous events after vaccination should be reported.28These reports of suspected associations between vaccine administration and ad- verse events can then be evaluated for strength of potential causality. Summary Statement 4: Measuring levels of IgG antibodies to the immunizing agents in a vaccine suspected of causing a serious adverse reaction to determine whether they are at pro- tective levels can help determine whether subsequent doses are required. (B) In a patient who has experienced an apparent adverse reaction to a vaccine yet has received fewer than the recommended numberof doses, the level of IgG antibodies to the immunizing agent canbe measured to see whether it is at a level associated with protection from disease. Such levels have been established for some but not all vaccines ( Table I ), 11,29-35and many are available from diagnostic laboratories. If serologic evidence of immunityis documented, consideration can be given to withholding addi- tional doses, although the magnitude and duration of immunity might be less than if all doses were received. 36,37Even if the rec- ommended number of doses has already been received or if pro- tective antibody levels have already been achieved, evaluation of the reaction, including skin testing, if indicated, should be under-taken, as discussed herein.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL JULY Statement 5: All suspected anaphylactic reac- tions to vaccines should ideally be evaluated in an attempt to determine the culprit allergen. (B) When a patient experiences an apparently IgE-mediated reaction after an immunization, the patient is often labeled asbeing ''allergic'' to the vaccine and advised against receivingfuture doses without further investigation. However, this ap- proach should be avoided because it might leave patients inadequately immunized if they unnecessarily avoid vaccinesto which they are not allergic or if the vaccine could be administered safely despite the allergy. In addition, not knowing the particular constituent of a vaccine to which the patient isallergic might pose a risk with future doses of other vaccines thatcontain the same ingredient. Summary Statement 6: IgE-mediated reactions to vaccines are more often caused by additive or residual vaccine compo-nents, such as gelatin, rather than the microbial immunizing agent itself. (B) Gelatin is added to many vaccines ( Table II ) as a stabilizer and has been shown to be responsible for many anaphylactic MMR varicella vaccines in the United States still contain gelatin,vaccine manufacturers in Japan and Germany removed gelatin or changed to a less allergenic gelatin, with a resultant decrease in allergic reactions. 42,43A new Japanese encephalitis vaccine does not contain gelatin.44A history of allergy to the ingestion of gelatin should be sought before the administration of anygelatin-containing vaccine. A negative history, however, mightnot exclude an allergic reaction to gelatin injected with the vac- cine. 39Gelatin used in vaccines is of either bovine or porcine or- igin, which are extensively cross-reactive.38,39,45Some patients sensitized to beef or pork meat are also sensitized to beef or pork gelatin, which might place them at risk for reactions to gelatin-containing vaccines.45 Measles and mumps vaccines and one type of rabies vaccine are grown in chick embryo broblast cultures and containnegligible or no egg protein. 46,47Measles or MMR vaccines can be administered to children with egg allergy without adverse re- actions48,49and can be given to such patients without skin FIG 1. Suggested approach to suspected adverse reactions to a vaccine.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 130, NUMBER 1KELSO ET AL 29testing.50Egg protein is present in higher amounts in yellow fever and influenza vaccines46and could, in theory, cause reactions in recipients with egg allergy. However, numerous studies have demonstrated that injectable influenza vaccine can be safely ad- ministered even to patients with severe egg allergy with appropri-ate precautions, 51-59likely because of the very low amount of egg protein (ovalbumin) contained in recent years'vaccines.60-62Rec- ommendations regarding the administration of influenza vac-cine to recipients with egg allergy are specically addressed inan addendum at the end of this practice parameter . If patients have a history of reaction to the influenza vaccine itself, as opposed to a history of a reaction to the ingestion of eggs,evaluation as per Fig 1 is appropriate. Patients can be allergic to heat-labile egg proteins in raw egg and, because they toleratethe ingestion of cooked egg, do not think of themselves as havingegg allergy. 63Thus the clinical history might not identify all per- sons allergic to egg proteins present in influenza or yellow fever vaccines. Chicken proteins other than those found in chicken egg might be present in yellow fever vaccine and could be respon-sible for reactions in recipients with chicken allergy. 64 Hepatitis B vaccines are grown in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast or brewer's yeast) and contain residual yeast pro-tein, 12but adverse reactions to these, if any, appear to be rare.65Quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4) might alsocontain residual yeast protein. 12 The ''rubber'' in vaccine vial stoppers or syringe plungers can be either dry natural rubber (DNR) latex or synthetic rubber.Those made with DNR pose a theoretic risk to the patient who is allergic to latex. There is one report of an anaphylactic reaction in a patient with latex allergy after hepatitis B vaccine, which wasattributed to rubber in the stopper. 66A review of more than 160,000 VAERS reports found only 28 cases of possible immediate-type allergic reactions after receiving a DNR- containing vaccine, and these might have been due to other com-ponents. 67The latex content of vaccine packaging is provided inTable III and is updated at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/ pinkbook/pink-appendx.htm .68 There is a single report of an immediate-type allergic reaction to a vaccination that was attributed to neomycin.69However, the patient had a maculopapular (not urticarial) rash to the topicalapplication of neomycin, and no testing for IgE to neomycinwas performed. There is a single case report of an immediate- type reaction that might have been caused by thimerosal in a vaccine. 70 However rare, if a patient provides a history of an immediate- type reaction to yeast, latex, neomycin, or thimerosal, it isappropriate to investigate with immediate-type skin testing beforeimmunization with a vaccine containing these constituents. A recent publication described 8 children with anaphylaxis within 1 hour of receiving diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussisvaccines (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine [DTaP] or tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis [Tdap]). 71Six had histories of past allergic re- actions to cow's milk, and all had very high levels of milk-specicserum IgE. These vaccines might contain trace (nanogram) quan- tities of residual casein from the medium in which they are pro- duced. The results of this report require further investigation. 72 Anaphylactic reactions to DTaP or Tdap vaccines are rare, and the majority of patients with cow's milk allergy tolerate them without reaction. It is recommended that all patients, includingthose with milk allergy, continue to receive these vaccines on schedule 71,72but perhaps with some additional observation after vaccination in those with very high levels of milk sensitivity. Table IV lists vaccine excipients by vaccine. Updated lists of vaccine excipients by vaccine and by excipient are available at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/pink-appendx.htm .12,73 Summary Statement 7: Patients who have had an apparent anaphylactic reaction after immunization should undergo immediate-type allergy skin testing to help conrm that the reaction was IgE mediated and determine the responsiblecomponent of the vaccine. (B) Skin testing with vaccine should be performed to determine whether the vaccine was responsible for a patient's apparentallergic reaction. 36,37The vaccine should rst be tested by using the prick method. If the past vaccine reaction was life-threatening, it is appropriate to use dilute vaccine for the skinprick test; in all other cases, full-strength vaccine should beused for the skin prick test. If the full-strength skin prick test result is negative, with appropriate positive and negative controls, an in- tradermal test with the vaccine diluted 1:100 should be per-formed, 74again with appropriate controls. As with any skin test reagent and particularly with materials not standardized for skin testing, such as vaccines, false-positive(irritant) results and clinically irrelevant positive results canTABLE I.

Likewise, a false-negative response might also be seen. Some patients known to have IgE antibodies to various vaccinesby means of in vitro testing or skin testing have nonethelessreceived the vaccines in the usual manner without reaction. 52,75-78 Although these ndings complicate the interpretation of vaccineskin test results, if the test result is positive in a patient with a his- tory of an allergic reaction to the vaccine, the patient must be trea- ted with caution. The suggested approach to patients withapparent immediate-type allergic reactions to vaccines and nega- tive or positive vaccine skin test results are described in Summary Statements 8 and 9, respectively. Intradermal skin tests with somevaccines, such as tetanus toxoid, can also induce delayed-type hy- persensitivity responses. 79 If the suspect vaccine contains egg (influenza and yellow fever), gelatin ( Table II ), latex ( cer- vaccine and quad- rivalent human papillomavirus vaccine), the patient should also be skin tested for these allergens.36,37Egg and yeast extracts for skin testing are commercially available.

There are no commercially availableimmediate-type skin test reagents or serum specic IgE tests for neomycin or thimerosal. Summary Statement 8: If the intradermal skin test result is negative, the chance that the patient has IgE antibody to anyvaccine constituent is negligible, and the vaccine can be ad- ministered in the usual manner. Nonetheless, in a patientwith a history suggestive of an anaphylactic reaction, it isprudent to administer the vaccine under observation, with ep-inephrine and other treatments available. (B) Intradermal skin tests are recommended for the evaluation of suspected anaphylaxis to a vaccine. Formal performance pa-rameters (eg, positive and negative predictive values) forintradermal skin testing to conrm or exclude allergy to avaccine or vaccine component have not been established. 79 There are no reports of patients with negative intradermalskin test results to a vaccine reacting to subsequent administra-tion of that vaccine. As with any diagnostic test, the increased sensitivity of intradermal testing likely comes with some loss of specicity. Thus there are reports of patients receiving thevaccines uneventfully despite positive skin test results. 78Dilu- tions of vaccines of 1:100 have been demonstrated to be nonir-ritating. 74Thus if the skin test results to the vaccine and its ingredients are negative, particularly at the intradermal level (with the vaccine diluted 1:100), then it is unlikely that the pa- tient has IgE antibody to any component of the vaccine, andthey can be given the vaccine in the usual manner butobserved for at least 30 minutes afterward. 36,37 Summary Statement 9: In a patient with a history and skin test results consistent with an IgE-mediated reaction to a vac-cine who requires additional doses of the suspect vaccine or other vaccines with common ingredients, consideration can be given to administering the vaccine in graded doses underobservation. (C) If vaccine or vaccine component skin test results are positive, the vaccine might still be administered, if necessary, in gradeddoses ( Table V ). 50,80-82If the full vaccine dose is normally a vol- ume of 0.5 mL, the patient is rst given 0.05 mL of a 1:10 dilution and then given full-strength vaccine (at 15-minute intervals) at doses of 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and nally 0.2 mL, for a cumulativedose of 0.5 mL.

This differs from the approach to patients with a his-tory of reactions to the ingestion of egg but no history of a reactionto influenza vaccination. Recommendations regarding the ad- ministration of influenza vaccine to recipients with egg allergyare specically addressed in an addendum at the end of thispractice parameter . Summary Statement 10: Some nonanaphylactic reactions to vaccines might also require evaluation, but only a few areabsolute contraindications to future doses. (B) In addition to anaphylactic reactions, some vaccines are capable of causing other rare but serious reactions that mightcontraindicate the administration of future doses. 11 The ''swine flu'' influenza vaccine administered in 1976 was associated with an increased risk for Guillain-Barr /C19e syndrome (GBS), which was estimated at 1 additional case per 100,000vaccinations (over the annual background rate of 1 to 2 cases per 100,000 adults). 83In subsequent years, influenza vaccines have been carefully monitored for this possible adverse effect and have shown no consistent increased risk. If there is any increased risk, it is on the order of 1 per million.83,84A low level of GBS cases continues to be reported in temporal association with previ- ous influenza infection85,86and with influenza and other vac- cines.87,88Specic attention was paid to the potential for GBS after the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccine campaign,and no increased rate was found. 89,90Persons with GBS within 6 weeks of influenza vaccination should avoid subsequent immu- nization with influenza vaccines.83However, patients with a his- tory of GBS unrelated to influenza infection or vaccination who would benet from immunization can be vaccinated, particularly if the influenza infection risk is high.83 MMR vaccines can cause adverse reactions related to the live viruses they contain. Transient rashes appear in as many as 5% ofrecipients of measles vaccine, and this probably represents vaccine-induced modied measles. 32There is a late-onset fever occurring 5 to 12 days after vaccine administration in as manyas 15% of recipients of the MMR vaccine. 32,50,91As with any fe- ver in young children, this increases the risk of febrile seizures;however, such seizures do not have any sort of long-term seque-lae. 92,93For reasons that are not clear, when the MMR is given in a combination vaccine with varicella (ie, measles, mumps, ru-bella, and varicella vaccine), there is a 2-fold higher risk of febrileseizures than if the MMR and varicella vaccines are given asseparate injections at the same visit (one additional febrile seizureper 2500 children vaccinated). 94This increased risk exists only for the rst dose of the vaccines, which is typically given between12 and 15 months of age, and not for the second dose, which istypically given between 4 and 6 years of age. For this reason, the preferred strategy is to administer the MMR and varicella vac- cines as separate injections at the same visit for the rst dose andcombined as measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine forthe second 94Recipients of the MMR vaccine can also have thrombocytopenia, which is usually without any signicantclinical consequence but can rarely cause hemorrhage. 26,91,95,96 The rate of thrombocytopenia is much higher with the measles disease itself.91Rubella vaccine can cause acute arthritis in ap- proximately 15% of adult women who receive the vaccine.35,97 This might represent a direct infection of the joints by the vaccinevirus but has a questionable association with chronic arthritis. 35,97 Rubella vaccine can also cause transient arthralgia in children. None of these events are contraindications to the administrationof subsequent doses of MMR vaccine. 11 The most serious adverse effect related to pertussis vaccine is termed encephalopathy. This term describes a specic and quitesevere reaction characterized as an ''acute, severe CNS [central nervous system] disorder occurring within 7 days following vaccination and generally consisting of major alterations inconsciousness, unresponsiveness, generalized or focal seizures that persist more than a few hours, with failure to recover within 24 hours.'' 26The estimated additional risk of this event attributed to the vaccine is 0 to 10 per million doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis (DTP) vaccine.91This can have permanent neurologic sequelae and is an absolute contraindica- tion to further pertussis vaccination (including acellular pertus-sis). 11Pertussis vaccine can cause less febrile seizures,92inconsolable cry- ing,50and hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes.98Although these are clearly concerning episodes for parents to witness, none of them result in permanent sequelae, and none of them are contra- indications to further doses of these vaccines.11,91,99Of note is the fact that all these serious and less serious neurologic events after pertussis-containing vaccines have been signicantly reduced since changing from DTP to the DTaP.34,50,99-103 About 5% of immunizations with tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines cause large local swelling at the injection site.104,105This probably represents an Arthus reaction in patients with preexist-ing IgG anti-tetanus antibodies from prior immunizations whothen receive a large injection of antigen in the vaccine. These re- actions can cause discomfort but are not serious. Because of in- creasing rates of pertussis in adolescents and adults, newvaccines were recommended in 2006 for those 11 to 64 years of age to provide not only booster doses for tetanus and diphtheria (Td) but also pertussis (Tdap). 104,106The recommended interval between doses of Td had been 10 years, with shorter intervals thought to be associated with increased rates of Arthus reactions. However, in a recent study the rate of Tdap injection-site reactionswas the same in patients who had received Td less than 2 yearspreviously or more than 2 years previously. 107Another study found no higher rates of injection-site reactions whether a Tdap-containing vaccine was administered 1 month after a Td-containing vaccine or placebo. 108Thus with the pertussis disease burden continuing to be substantial, it is now recommended thatTdap be given to all adolescents and adults (including those > _65 years of age), regardless of the interval since the last Td. 109TABLE V. Administration of vaccines in graded doses For a vaccine in which the full normal dose volume is 0.5 mL, give the following doses at 15-minute intervals as tolerated *: 0.05 mL 1:10 dilution 0.05 mL full-strength 0.1 mL full-strength 0.15 mL full-strength 0.2 mL full-strength *Must be done under direct medical supervision prepared with emergency medications and equipment to promptly treat an anaphylactic reaction should it occur.Observe for at least 30 minutes afterward.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL JULY 201234KELSO ET ALTetanus toxoid also has some potential association with GBS and with a rare local neurologic event called brachial neuritis, which involves shoulder pain followed by weakness.26However, neither GBS nor brachial neuritis is a contraindication to the receipt of ad- ditional doses of tetanus-containing vaccines.104 Varicella vaccine is another live virus immunization that can cause vaccine-induced illness, particularly the appearance ofvaricella lesions. These reactions occur at the injection site inapproximately 3% of recipients and are more generalized in another 3%. 110The rash typically appears within 3 weeks of vac- cination.111The disease caused by coincident natural exposure might be difcult to distinguish from vaccine-induced varicella,and most rashes are due to wild-type virus. 111A zoster-type rash can rarely appear after a varicella vaccination and might con- tain either vaccine-strain or wild-type virus.112,113As with MMR vaccine described above, varicella vaccine can cause a late-onsetfever and rarely febrile seizures, again without long-term seque-lae. Although varicella disease (chickenpox) itself can be moresevere in children with atopic dermatitis, the varicella vaccine can be safely administered to children with atopic dermatitis without an increased risk of complications, 114and humoral and cellular immune responses to the vaccine are similar in children with and without atopic dermatitis.115 A serious adverse effect of yellow fever vaccine is encepha- litis.116The risk for this complication is as high as 4 per 1000 in- fants, and for this reason, the vaccine is relatively contraindicated in this age group. It should not be given to any infant younger than6 months; it should only be given to those younger than 9 months if their risk from the disease is very high. 117The yellow fever vac- cine has recently been associated with a very severe multisystem illness in adults with features that are strikingly similar to those ofyellow fever disease itself. 117This adverse reaction, now termed yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease, has oc-curred exclusively in rst-time vaccine recipients and has a65% mortality rate. 117Most yellow fever vaccine-associated vis- cerotropic disease has occurred in patients who are not known tobe immunocompromised; however, a history of a thymus disorderand age 60 years or greater have been identied as risk factors, making these a contraindication and a precaution, respectively. 117 The cause of these reactions is still unknown, but this vaccine should not be given to patients unless they are at risk of acquiring yellow fever, typically by traveling to an area in which the disease is endemic. An inactivated, and thus presumably safer, vaccine isbeing developed. 118 Summary Statement 11: Pregnant women should not be vaccinated with live vaccines. However, pregnant womenshould be given inactivated influenza vaccine, as well as teta-nus and hepatitis B vaccine, if otherwise indicated. (B) Because of a theoretic risk of transmitting the live agent to the fetus, pregnant women should not receive live vaccines, such asMMR, varicella vaccine, or LAIV . 119There is an increased risk of hospitalization from influenza in pregnancy, and therefore (inacti-vated) influenza vaccine is specically indicated in women whowill be pregnant during the influenza season. 119Hepatitis B vaccine and tetanus and diphtheria vaccines should also be administered to pregnant women if they would otherwise be indicated.119 Summary Statement 12: In general, live vaccines should not be given to persons who are immune compromised because ofa risk of generalized infection with the immunizing agent. (B) Live vaccines ( Table VI ) are generally contraindicated in pa- tients with immune suppression, specically those deciency. severe combined immune deciency, severe HIV infection, leukemia, lymphoma, or other malignant neo-plasms or patients requiring treatment for these or other condi- tions with treatment modalities that impair immune responses, such as high-dose corticosteroids (2 weeks of daily treatmentwith prednisone, 20 mg or 2 mg/kg or equivalent per day). There are, however, exceptions even to this general rule that immune- compromised patients should not receive live viral vaccines,and readers are referred to other published guidelines for details. 11,50,120,121 Summary Statement 13: Specic vaccines or vaccination in general have been purported to have long-term consequences, including atopy, autism, and multiple sclerosis. Epidemiologic studies have not supported such associations. (B) There are a number of controversies related to the long-term consequences of particular vaccines or of vaccination in general.There have been claims that receiving childhood vaccinations increases the likelihood of atopic disease, autism, diabetes, ormultiple sclerosis. The associations have all been extensively evaluated by using many appropriate research methods and epidemiologic studies, and no relationship between vaccinationsand any of these outcomes has been demonstrated in these studies. 122-127There has been particular concern about thimero- sal, which was previously used as a preservative in vaccines. Although studies have not supported any adverse effect from thi-merosal exposure in vaccines, 128-130all routinely recommended vaccines for infants and children in the United States are nowavailable only as thimerosal-free formulations or contain onlytrace amounts of thimerosal, with the exception of some inacti- vated influenza vaccines. Inactivated influenza vaccine for pediat- ric use is available as a thimerosal preservative-containingformulation, a trace thimerosal-containing formulation, and a thimerosal-free formulation. 50 ADDENDUM Administering influenza vaccine to recipients withegg allergy Influenza vaccines are grown on embryonated chicken eggs, leading to concern that residual egg protein (ovalbumin) couldTABLE VI. Live versus killed vaccines Live vaccines Killed vaccines Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) Diphtheria, tetanus, 1KELSO ET AL 35provoke an allergic reaction in a recipient with egg allergy. However, all studies to date have suggested that the risk of such reactions is very low.52-58This addendum to the practice param- eter update reflects changes to recommendations for administra- tion of TIV to patients with egg allergy based on several studies completed since the original focused practice parameter was pub-lished in January 2011 131and is consistent with new guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices51(Fig 2) and the Committee on Infectious Diseases (Red Book commit- tee) of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).132Immuni- zation of such patients provides them the substantial protection that the vaccine provides against the morbidity and mortality as-sociated with influenza disease. The areas of residual uncertainty in the original parame- ter 131stemmed from the fact that relatively few studies had in- vestigated the safety of administering TIV to patients with a history of a severe reaction to the ingestion of egg and concern about the amount of residual ovalbumin in some vaccines.Studies published in the past year offer further data supportingthe safety of influenza vaccine in even patients with severe egg allergy 56-58and offer reassurance about the ovalbumin content of the vaccines.62This parameter offers evidence-based guid- ance on how to evaluate patients with egg allergy before influ-enza vaccination and how to administer the vaccine to such patients.Summary statements Summary Statement 14: Patients with egg allergy should receive influenza vaccinations (TIV) because the risks of vac- cinating are outweighed by the risks of not vaccinating. (A) There are now 7 published studies (6 from the past 2 years) reporting on vaccination of patients with egg allergy withTIV. 52-58The details of these studies are summarized in Table VII. More than 1600 patients (mostly children) with egg allergy have been vaccinated without any serious reactions. Zero percentto 6.3% of vaccinations have involved reactions conned to the skin (eg, hives). Zero percent to 4.8% of vaccinations have in- volved mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. No reac-tions have involved symptoms of hypotension. None of these reactions required treatment with epinephrine. One study in- cluded an additional 3640 patients with reported but not provedegg allergy given influenza vaccine; 1.2% had skin reactions and 0.7% had respiratory reactions, including 2 who were given epinephrine, although the authors concluded that these were notanaphylactic reactions. 54Of note, in those studies that included control subjects without egg allergy, similar rates of reactions be- tween the 2 groups are reported, indicating that not all adverse re- actions to influenza vaccine are related to egg allergy.52,54,55,57 Between 86,494 and 544,909 (average 294,128) persons are hospitalized each year in the United States because of influenza,including an average of 21,156 hospitalizations in children lessthan 5 years of age. 133Three thousand three hundred forty-nine to FIG 2.

Summary Statement 15: Persons with a history of suspected egg allergy should be evaluated by an allergist to determine the status of their egg allergy, but this should not delay their influenza vaccination. (A) Persons with a history of suspected egg allergy should be evaluated by an allergist. 136The evaluation should include a de- tailed history of the nature and timing of prior suspected reactions to egg. If the clinical history is consistent with egg allergy, thenskin prick testing to egg or specic in vitro IgE antibody testing for egg is indicated to conrm sensitization. With a convincingclinical history and evidence of specic IgE, the diagnosis canbe conrmed, but in certain circumstances an oral food challengeto egg might be necessary or desired. 136Influenza vaccine should not be withheld from those undergoing egg allergy evaluation orfrom those with conrmed egg allergy. Suspected egg allergy de-serves evaluation, regardless of the influenza vaccination status. Summary Statement 16: A growing number of studies sug- gest that influenza vaccines can be safely administered, evento patients with a history of anaphylaxis to egg ingestion. (B)Most studies on influenza vaccine in patients with egg allergy have specically included patients with histories of anaphylaxisto egg ingestion. 52,54,55,57,58The number of such patients now col- lectively reported is 185, about 13% of the total population of pa- tients with proved egg allergy studied. These patients with severe egg allergy have tolerated the vaccine without serious reactions,as is the case with patients with less severe egg allergy. Summary Statement 17: Skin testing (prick, intradermal, or both) with the influenza vaccine itself in patients with eggallergy (but without a history of reacting to the vaccine itself) does not reliably identify patients who are at increased risk of reacting to the vaccine and is not recommended. (A) In studies in which vaccine skin testing was done because of a history of egg allergy, vaccinated patients with skin test results had no reactions or no greater rate of reactions than subjects with negative skin test results. 52,53,55,57,58In one study the vaccine was withheld from patients with positive prick or intradermal vaccine skin test results.53However, skin testing was later removed from the protocol; all patients were vaccinated, and the rate (low) of re- actions (minor) was the same as when skin testing had been in- cluded in the protocol. The authors concluded that vaccine skin testing was unnecessary.53 Skin testing is of utility in evaluation of a patient with a history of an allergic reaction to the influenza vaccine itself and isaddressed in another section of this parameter and below. Summary Statement 18: Influenza vaccine can be adminis- tered as a single dose to patients with egg allergy. (B) In those studies of influenza vaccine in patients with egg allergy that have divided the dose (rst administering 10% and, if noreaction in 30 minutes, the administering the remaining 90%), the vast majority of patients ultimately tolerate the entire dose, 52-58 and studies administering the vaccine as a single dose also report no serious reactions.54,55,57,58The CDC and AAP have concluded that persons who have experienced only hives after exposure toegg should receive influenza vaccine and that in these patientsvaccine skin testing and dividing the dose are no longer necessaryor recommended. 51,132 In those patients with a history of more severe reactions to egg ingestion, the CDC and AAP recommend that before receipt ofvaccine, such persons should be referred to an allergy special- ist. 51,132Studies support the single-dose approach, even in these patients with severe egg allergy.

(A) Given the possibility of allergic reactions to any vaccine, health care providers who administer vaccinations should have properresuscitative equipment available in the ofce to manage ana-phylaxis. 11Although a large number of patients with egg allergy have been given the influenza vaccine in the published studiescited above, this cannot exclude a rare reaction. Thus although an-nual TIV vaccination is offered at many pharmacies and other nonmedical settings, patients with egg allergy should receive the vaccine in a medical setting with the personnel and equipmentdescribed above. Furthermore, patients with egg allergy receivinginfluenza vaccine should be observed for 30 minutes after vacci- nation. Most vaccine studies have used an observation period of 30 minutes, 53,55-58and this interval is consistent with the observa- tion period recommended after receiving subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy.137 Summary Statement 20: Patients with egg allergy with a history of only hives after egg ingestion can receive influenzavaccine in a primary care provider's ofce provided the ap- propriate personnel and equipment are available as per Sum-mary Statement 19, whereas those with a history of more severe reactions to egg ingestion should receive their vaccine in an allergist's ofce. (C) Studies done to date indicate that adverse reactions to influenza vaccine in recipients with egg allergy are rare and mild. 52-58 Nonetheless, the number of patients studied to date (approxi-mately 5000) cannot exclude the possibility of a rare serious reac-tion. These studies have included relatively small numbers of patients with histories of severe egg allergy (approximately 200) who would presumably be at greater risk. Thus although pa-tients with a history of mild reactions to egg ingestion (hives only) can receive their vaccine in a primary care provider's ofce, those with a history of more severe reactions (cardiovascular, respira-tory, or gastrointestinal symptoms) should receive the influenza vaccine in an allergist's ofce. In both cases, personnel to recog- nize and equipment to treat anaphylaxis need to be immediatelyavailable, but the allergist's ofce affords additional expertise inthis area should it be required. 51,132 Summary Statement 21: All influenza vaccines available in the United States contain low amounts of ovalbumin. (A) In many of the studies on administration of influenza vaccine to recipients with egg allergy, the egg protein (ovalbumin)content of the vaccine was reported. 52,54-58Vaccines used have contained as much as a 0.7 mg per 0.5 mL dose without serious reactions, implying that at least that much is generally well tol-erated. 56Data pertaining to ''safe'' ovalbumin levels have been limited to analyzing lot content after a study has been completedrather than prospectively attempting to assess a dose-response relationship. Thus it is not known whether there is an amount of ovalbumin per dose that would be associated with a higherrate of reactions or more severe reactions. Three of the 4 manufacturers of injectable influenza vaccines (CSL, King of Prussia, Pa; GlaxoSmithKline, Research TrianglePark, NC; and Novartis, Emeryville, Calif) report the maximumamount of ovalbumin per 0.5 mL dose in their package inserts.The other manufacturer, Sano Pasteur (Lyon, France), will provide the information on request by telephone (1-800- 822-2463) or e-mail ( MIS.Emails@sanopasteur.com ). All of the claimed amounts are less than 1 mg per 0.5 mL dose (Table VIII ). When the actual amount of ovalbumin in the vaccines has been measured in independent laboratories, the levels are usuallymuch lower than the claimed amounts. Three groups have separately analyzed the ovalbumin content from the United States-approved influenza vaccines for both H1N1 (2009-2010season) and TIV (both and content ranged from 0.008 to 0.71 mg per 0.5 mL dose. Summary Statement 22: Although the intranasally admin- istered LAIV contains a low amount of ovalbumin, all pub-lished studies to date have evaluated the injectable TIV, andthus TIV rather than LAIV should be used for recipientswith egg allergy. (C) The amount of ovalbumin in the intranasal LAIVis not stated in the package insert, but the manufacturer, MedImmune (Gaithers-burg, Md), indicates by personal communication that the vaccine contains less than 0.24 mg per 0.2 mL dose. When the actual amount of ovalbumin in the vaccine has been measured in independent laboratories, it has been found to be very low, between 0.00013 to 0.0017 mg per 0.2 mL dose. This very low amount of ovalbumin is likely to be safe in patients with egg allergy; however, there are no published studies to date on exposure through the intranasal route. Given the large amount of data on the safety of injectable influenza vaccine in patients withegg allergy, TIV is recommended until ongoing studies on LAIVare published. 51,132 Summary Statement 23: For patients with a history of aller- gic reaction to the influenza vaccine itself, additional evalua-tion is appropriate, including skin testing with the vaccine and vaccine ingredients. For patients with positive skin test results, the vaccine can be administered in multiple divideddoses or can be withheld. (B) The topic of this addendum is administration of influenza vaccine to recipients with egg allergy. This clinical situation isdifferent than management of a patient with a history of an allergic reaction to the receipt of a prior dose of influenza vaccine itself. If a patient has had an apparent allergic reaction to anyvaccine, they should be evaluated by an allergist to determinewhether the reaction was IgE mediated and, if so, to determine the culprit allergen. This evaluation involves skin testing with the vaccine and with vaccine constituents. If such test results arepositive, consideration can still be given to administering subsequent doses of the vaccine, if required, in multiple graded doses. This is specically covered in a previous section of thisparameter. There has been a great deal of additional information published over the past year demonstrating the safety of influenza vaccina-tion in patients with egg allergy. Health care providers should no longer withhold the vaccine from any patient with egg allergy. In an update to recommendations made in the last year, it is nowconsidered safe for patients even with a history of a severe egg allergy to receive influenza vaccination.
