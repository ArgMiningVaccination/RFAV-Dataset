This is the first time I have ever had anything similar to this done. I absolutely loved it. I left feeling exhausted and exhilarated at the same time. I enjoyed immensely talking with her and loved her feedback after the session. I got business cards from her and have already put her out there on my Facebook. I will definitely be booking again and she has a loyal client for life. - 6/5/2023 This was my 1st time experience and it was very pleasant! Terry had great energy and you can tell she was passionate about her work. She let me know the steps she was going to take and once she started was extremely focused. I felt calm and at ease and will definitely be making an appointment when I make a trip back to SD! - 12/7/2022 SOUND HEALING! (5 stars) Opening up to ancient and alternative healing! People who know me well will buy me \"experiences\" for gifts because I like to \"explore\". I received a gift card from someone who enjoyed their sound healing experience and wanted me to try it. Not looking for physical healing through sound healing, looking to accomplish relaxation and positive aura vibes. - made contact to set an appointment - street parking - arrived 10 min early and filled out forms SESSION. Every person's experience will be different. I decided NOT to research it in advance and wanted to come in without having any pre-notions to taint my own experience. So, I have no idea what to expect. Terry is warm hearted and welcoming with lots of energy and passionate about healing! She asked me to be open and receive and that I did! Prior to our session I did fill out paperwork regarding some medical stuff. My motorcycle accident caused me to have a traumatic brain injury and one thing (of many things) that was impacted was hearing. It is challenging for me to hear loud things without sensitivity to my ear and anything loud or bright can quickly trigger a migraine. This session is going to be full of sounds, so I brought some protection (ear plugs) to muffle the decibels. I laid on my back on a bed in the center of the suite and was surrounded by bowls (and instruments) of all sizes. I had a light blanket over my body and I closed my eyes and the sound healing begun. LET ME TELL YOU!!! I fell into relaxation immediately. I dozed off several times throughout the session, mind slips and melts away into a meditation like state. When I would doze off my mind was elsewhere and definitely didn't feel like I was in the room. My relaxation and imagination brought me to different places where I feel most relaxed. Every time I dozed off I snapped back out of it thinking \"whoa did I just fall asleep\" and then I'd doze off again. I wish I didn't wake myself up and let myself go. Something about the sounds were healing hence \"sound healing\". It was nice and very relaxing. It's an experience and i HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to anyone curious. Until the next review... - 2/5/2023 One of the BEST energy healing sessions I've had. I absolutely love the Signature Session which combines massage, reiki, and sound healing for a magical experience. Terry is wonderful and gives great intuitive feedback after the sessions. I left feeling lighter and energetically reset and refreshed. I highly recommend! - 1/26/2023 Terry was absolutely wonderful, she was so accommodating with my schedule and made my appointment possible. I went to try reiki for the first time and I'm so glad my experience was with her. She made me feel very comfortable and even went above and beyond in my session. If you're interested in any healing work, I highly recommend Terry. She is fantastic!!! - 10/7/2022 Probably one of the best things I've ever done. I did the new client special and I was not disappointed. My session with Terry was so relaxing and blissful that my life started shifting as soon as I left her office. I felt centered, relaxed, grounded and balanced all day afterwards...stress just melted away. She also happens to be one of the coolest, warmest people you ever meet. You can tell she loves what she does because her passion is contagious. Go here, you won't regret it! - 7/14/2022 Terry earned and deserves all of the 5 stars (and more) that she has here. It is rare to find someone who truly loves what they do AND delivers an amazing service/experience. She is very knowledgeable and cares about her clients. If you like pampering and looking to improve your overall wellness, look no further. - 10/1/2021 I just had my first Reki energy healing done and Terry was absolutely aaamazing! The whole experience was very relaxing and the energy work being done on me was an out of this world experience! I can feel the work taking place; very hard to describe! I definitely needed this! Highly recommend and she is LEGIT. Will be coming back for tune ups until my Chakra is balanced! Thanks Terry! - 8/9/2022 Wow! My first session with Terry was insightful, powerful, transformative, and everything I needed. Terry is full of welcoming energy and made me feel comfortable immediately. Her space is warm and very intentional. Terry is intuitive, gifted and doesn't judge. At the end of the two-hour Signature Session, I was incredibly relaxed, open, and grateful. I highly recommend Terry and I will be seeing her again. - 5/24/2021 I had an incredible first session with Terry! Her incorporation of sound healing, reiki, and massage was masterful and created a really powerful experience. I appreciated how much time she took to explain her process before the session and debrief after - her intuitive insights were spot-on and will continue to support and assist me for weeks to come. She is also a naturally giving and compassionate person, and gave me ideas and connections for networking in ways that would support my own career. I would absolutely recommend Terry's signature session to anyone who would like to experience an energy/massage healing and gain awareness into where we may have stuck points.
