A: Soaking for long periods of time in any product may increase the risk of urinary tract infections (also known as UTIs) which are commonly marked by a painful, stinging sensation while urinating. There's no reason to skip bathing altogether, but it's good common practice to use a pH balanced soap, which reduces the risk of throwing your urinary tract out of balance. The risk is also reduced when gentle, [organic bath products](https://www.skincareox.com/27-best-organic-body-washes-soap-bars/) ingredients are used. Q: Are Bath Bombs Good For Your Skin? A: Conventional ones made with harsh soaps and fragrances can strip the skin of moisture and cause irritation. The artificial and potentially toxic ingredients can include phthalates, sodium laureth sulfate (SLS) and synthetic fragrances; all of [which are known skin irritants](https://www.ewg.org/enviroblog/2014/01/chemicals-should-disappear-cosmetics).

Most likely thanks to a cocktail of toxic ingredients like fragrance, and artificial dyes that serve no purpose to your health. Q: What's the Purpose of Citric Acid in Bath Bombs?

Citric acid has also been shown to be a useful and effective ingredient for increased cell renewal, hydration, and [epidermal thickening in sun-damaged skin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9256916/).

A:If you use a bath bomb which contains harsh ingredients such as sodium laureth sulfate, detergents, and [fragrances you may experience dry skin](https://www.ewg.org/enviroblog/2014/01/chemicals-should-disappear-cosmetics).
