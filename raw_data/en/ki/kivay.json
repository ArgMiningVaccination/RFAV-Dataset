Allopathic, osteopathic, and naturopathic physicians all learn [outpatient](http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/tc/outpatient-services-learning-about-outpatient-services) [family medicine](https://www.aamc.org/cim/specialty/exploreoptions/list/us/336840/family_medicine.html) and [primary care medicine](https://medicine.mc.vanderbilt.edu/primary-care-definition). Thus, for better understanding of the training of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths), as a comparison to specialty areas of the allopathic and osteopathic medical professions, naturopathic physicians can be thought of as integrative, outpatient family medicine physicians with an emphasis on natural medical treatment modalities. Below are answers to frequently asked questions about naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) in the USA. What diagnostic and treatment modalities are naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) trained in?1 Naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) are trained in conventional, holistic, complementary, integrative, and alternative diagnostic and therapeutic treatment modalities, including nutritional medicine; botanical medicine; homeopathic medicine; pharmaceutical medicine; physical medicine, including osseous and soft tissue manipulative therapy and hydrotherapy; mind-body medicine, including counseling; environmental medicine; lifestyle medicine, including and diet; minor surgery; phlebotomy; intravenous and injection therapy; traditional Asian medicine, including acupuncture; public health; imaging; and naturopathic obstetrics. The use of physical medicine treatment modalities by a naturopathic physician (naturopath) is sometimes referred to as \"naturopathic physical medicine\" and osseous and soft tissue manipulative therapy is sometimes referred to as \"naturopathic manipulative medicine\" (\"NMM\"). Like with all health care professions, as scientific discoveries and developments, such as pharmaceutical medications, have advanced and enhanced the practice of medicine, the scope of training and, thus, the scope of practice of the naturopathic medical profession has changed to reflect the discoveries and developments to protect the safety and the health of the public. How many years of training in medical school do naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) receive?2 Naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) receive 4 years of training in naturopathic medical school. What are naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) well-known for?3 Naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) are known as experts in drug-herb-nutrient interactions and for emphasizing prevention of disease and overall wellness. Are naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) trained to practice evidence-based medicine?4 Yes, naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) are trained to practice evidence-based medicine. Are naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) trained to practice \"standards of care\"?5 Yes, naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) are trained to practice \" [standards of care](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3088386/)\". A naturopathic physician (naturopath) can be held liable for medical malpractice, just like an allopathic physician (allopath) or osteopathic physician (osteopath), if standards of care are not adhered to. Are naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) trained to practice independently?6 Yes, naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) are trained to practice independently, without oversight by another health care provider. Are naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) trained to work with and refer to other health care providers?7 Yes, naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) are trained to work with and refer to other health care providers. What pharmaceutical medications do naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) learn and need to know?8 Naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) learn and need to know [over-the-counter (OTC) drugs](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100101.htm), [legend drugs](http://www.revenue.state.mn.us/businesses/mncare/Pages/Legend_Drugs.aspx), and [scheduled drugs (pharmaceutical medications containing controlled substances)](https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml). Pharmacology is an integral and critical part of naturopathic medical education and, like allopathic physicians (allopaths) and osteopathic physicians (osteopaths), to ensure patient safety, naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) need to know how to appropriately prescribe [pharmaceutical medications](http://www.who.int/topics/pharmaceutical_products/en/), check for medication interactions, and put patients onto and take patients off of medications. Additionally, since naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) also study botany and nutrition, to be able to accurately prescribe botanical medications and nutritional medications, naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) learn and need to know drug-herb-nutrient interactions. Are naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) trained in vaccine administration?9 Yes, naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) are trained in vaccine administration as part of their training in pharmaceutical medicine, injection therapy, and [public health](https://www.apha.org/what-is-public-health). Like allopathic physicians (allopaths) and osteopathic physicians (osteopaths), they learn the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/) [vaccine administration recommendations and guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/recs-guidelines.html), [immunization schedules](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html), and [vaccine Do naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) need NPI and DEA numbers?10 Yes, naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) need [U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS)](https://www.hhs.gov/) [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)](https://www.cms.gov/) [National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES)](https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/NPPES/Welcome.do) (NPI)](https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/) and [U.S. Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/) [U.S. Drug Enforcement numbers in order to prescribe [prescription (legend)](http://www.revenue.state.mn.us/businesses/mncare/Pages/Legend_Drugs.aspx) [pharmaceutical medications](http://www.who.int/topics/pharmaceutical_products/en/). In some states with regulation of naturopathic medicine (naturopathy) and licensure of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths), state law does not yet accurately reflect scope of training of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) and naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) are allowed to prescribe prescription [pharmaceutical medications](http://www.who.int/topics/pharmaceutical_products/en/) classified as [legend drugs](http://www.revenue.state.mn.us/businesses/mncare/Pages/Legend_Drugs.aspx), but not those classified as [scheduled drugs](https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml). In those states, to prescribe [legend drugs](http://www.revenue.state.mn.us/businesses/mncare/Pages/Legend_Drugs.aspx), naturopathic (naturopaths) need only an [NPI [DEA number](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugreg/index.html#regapps) is needed only if [scheduled drugs](https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml) are prescribed. What pharmaceutical medications can naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) prescribe?11 The [pharmaceutical medications](http://www.who.int/topics/pharmaceutical_products/en/) that naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) are able to prescribe completely varies from state to state, depending on how the state legislation was written. The variation in legislation is mainly due to a lack of public education and understanding on the scope of training of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths). In the state of Washington, [Cannabis (marijuana), although federally classified as a Schedule I drug](https://www.dea.gov/pr/multimedia-library/publications/drug_of_abuse.pdf#page=72), is legal for recreational use and medical use. Naturopathic physicians (naturopaths), along with allopathic physicians (allopaths), osteopathic physicians (osteopaths), physician assistants, osteopathic physician assistants, and nurse practitioners are allowed to authorize the medical use of marijuana to patients. In the state of Arizona, Cannabis (marijuana) is legal for medical use. Naturopathic physicians (naturopaths), along with allopathic physicians (allopaths) and osteopathic physicians (osteopaths), are allowed to authorize the medical use of marijuana to patients. What is the importance of pharmaceutical prescribing rights for naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) that accurately reflect the scope of training of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths)?12 Public safety and health are the most important aspects of pharmaceutical prescribing rights for naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) that accurately reflect the scope of training of naturopathic physicians (naturopath). Since patients may choose to see a naturopathic physician (naturopath) for any symptom or complaint, without pharmaceutical prescribing rights that accurately reflecting scope of training, naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) may be unable to prescribe antibiotics for conditions such as strep throat, vaccines for vaccine-preventable diseases, epinephrine injectors for patients with risk of anaphylaxis due to allergic reaction, hormonal contraception, or emergency oxygen for life-threatening hypoxic (low oxygen) situations. It is important that the scope of training of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) is understood so that the scope of practice of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) in each state is consistent and accurately reflects the scope of training. What level of CPR are naturopathic medical students and physicians (naturopaths) required to know?13 Naturopathic medical students and physicians (naturopaths) are required to know basic [cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)](http://www.world-heart-federation.org/heart-facts/resources/videos/about-cvd/warning-signs/cpr/). In the USA, two organizations that offer educational training in CPR are the [American Heart Association (AHA)](http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/) and the [American Red Cross (ARC)](http://www.redcross.org/). Upon successful completion of a healthcare provider-level course in CPR, the [AHA](http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/) issues a \"certificate of completion\" in [Basic Life Support (BLS)](http://cpr.heart.org/AHAECC/CPRAndECC/Training/HealthcareProfessional/BasicLifeSupportBLS/UCM_473189_Basic-Life-Support-BLS.jsp) and the [ARC](http://www.redcross.org/) issues a \"Certificate of Completion\" in either [Basic Life Support (BLS) for Healthcare Providers](http://www.redcross.org/bls) or [CPR/AED for Professional Rescuers and Health Care Providers](http://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/preview-kits/cpr-aed-professional). Depending on the facility where a naturopathic physician (naturopath) works (for example, in a hospital), a naturopathic physician (naturopath) may also be required to know more advanced CPR procedures, and obtain an [AHA](http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/) \"certificate of completion\" in [Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS)](http://cpr.heart.org/AHAECC/CPRAndECC/Training/HealthcareProfessional/AdvancedCardiovascularLifeSupportACLS/UCM_473186_Advanced-Cardiovascular-Life-Support-ACLS.jsp) or [Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS)](http://cpr.heart.org/AHAECC/CPRAndECC/Training/HealthcareProfessional/Pediatric/UCM_476258_PALS.jsp). What are the differences in training between naturopathic physicians (naturopaths), allopathic physicians (allopaths), and osteopathic physicians [outpatient](http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/tc/outpatient-services-learning-about-outpatient-services) [family medicine](https://www.aamc.org/cim/specialty/exploreoptions/list/us/336840/family_medicine.html) and [primary care medicine](https://medicine.mc.vanderbilt.edu/primary-care-definition), with an emphasis on prevention and wellness, through the use of naturopathic treatment modalities. Pharmaceutical medicine and minor surgery are naturopathic treatment modalities. Comparatively, where allopathic physicians (allopaths) and osteopathic physicians (osteopaths) spend time learning [inpatient (hospital)](https://www.medicare.gov/what-medicare-covers/part-a/inpatient-or-outpatient.html) medicine, including the treatment modalities of major and minor surgery (and, in the case of osteopathic physicians, osteopathic manipulative medicine [OMM] and osteopathic manipulative treatment [OMT], in preparation for rotations in osteopathic manipulative therapy [OMTh]), naturopathic physicians (naturopaths) spend time learning the treatment modalities of nutritional medicine; botanical medicine; homeopathic medicine; pharmaceutical medicine; physical medicine, including osseous and soft tissue manipulative therapy and hydrotherapy; mind-body medicine, including counseling; lifestyle medicine, including hygiene and diet; minor surgery; phlebotomy; intravenous and injection therapy; traditional Asian medicine, including acupuncture; and naturopathic obstetrics. Allopathic, osteopathic, and naturopathic physicians all learn [outpatient](http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/tc/outpatient-services-learning-about-outpatient-services) [family medicine](https://www.aamc.org/cim/specialty/exploreoptions/list/us/336840/family_medicine.html) and [primary care medicine](https://medicine.mc.vanderbilt.edu/primary-care-definition). Thus, for better understanding of the training of naturopathic physicians (naturopaths), as a comparison to specialty areas of the allopathic and osteopathic medical professions, naturopathic physicians can be thought of as integrative, outpatient family medicine physicians with an emphasis on natural medical treatment modalities.
