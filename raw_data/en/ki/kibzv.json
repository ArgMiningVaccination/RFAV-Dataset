In some of these ceremonies I was the only person involved, and in others there were hundreds of participants. And I love them all. Ceremonies are all about connection, they provide a bridge between the personal, interpersonal and the sacred energy fields that exist within you and around you at all times. They work elegantly, simply and profoundly, and I believe them to be the single biggest transformer of the balance and healing of your energy fields. The more you work with ceremony, the more your energy fields are able to weave between the personal, the interpersonal and the sacred, helping you connect more and more into your place as a sacred being, a beloved and essential part of the great web of life. There are many daily ways that you can work with sacred consciousness for yourself, for your loved ones, for your community and for the earth. Every ceremony is impactful and healing, even a few seconds of sacred consciousness can transform everything about your day, and it is this understanding that I want to convey in this 90 minute class. My objective for this class is that you are empowered to: I will draw on my decades in clinical practice and lifelong ability of seeing energy to help you connect to and access the fullness of your life.
