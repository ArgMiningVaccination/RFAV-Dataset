I've been a patient for a couple of years now and literally live 6 hours away, that's how good they are and how much I love and appreciate the staff. They truly care about their patients and finding the root cause, never once has it been about my weight (which is usually the only thing other doctors focus on). I have never felt better, healthier or more supported in any other setting. They've helped me work through my PCOS and also discovered I have a gluten sensitivity, all through natural methods and not pushing any medications. My skin has never looked better and my menstrual cycle is regular for the first time in my life! Cannot say enough good things about the treatment I've received there.\"Jill \"After 2 separate recommendations, by 2 different providers, I made an appt at Shift Functional Medicine. I've been seeing Laura Evans for several months now, via Telehealth. She's been amazing! I truly look forward to my appts. She is very easy to talk to, listens to my concerns & issues and tailors treatment plans that are not only effective thus far, but personalized to fit into my lifestyle. I have a few health concerns we are tackling and Laura is very conscious not to overwhelm and articulates everything in a manner that is easy to understand. So grateful to have found someone I feel I can truly work with toward achieving my health goals.\"Tiff \"Dr. Agnew brings the best of both worlds to her practice. She integrates aspects of conventional Western medicine with a deep understanding of functional approaches that address the root of disease. She is genuinely interested in supporting her patients to achieve their best state of health, which is apparent with her attention and presence in appointments and follow-through. I trust her for comprehensive and thorough care.\"Megan \"Dr. Agnew is one of the most intellectually voracious healthcare providers I have met. She has trained in and demonstrated mastery in many different areas of medicine. Additionally, she is an absolute delight to work with. She is sharp as a tack and highly analytical, but still creative, humble and kind. She strikes an extraordinary balance between smarts and heart. I wouldn't hesitate to refer my patients to her.\"Dr. Gillham \"After almost two years of no real answers from a number of doctors and practitioners, Dr. Agnew helped me get to the root cause of my issues and supported me through many phases of treatments. When one thing was resolved and I still wasn't improving, she investigated further to find out why. She is responsive, so supportive and a real partner in your health journey. After a year from starting to work with her, I'm well on my way to full recovery and feel amazing. I'm so grateful to have found her!\"Elizabeth \"I recently started working with Laura on a whole host of chronic symptoms I've dealt with for 25+ years. While our work together is just beginning, I already feel really supported and comforted by her! You can feel her care and empathy and a genuine want to problem-solve together, which can feel like such a relief after struggling for so many years to piece things together on my own or to find a practitioner willing to look at my symptoms holistically. I'm so excited to be working with her and to see where I'm at in a "}
