Download Dr. Ibrahim Jaffe's New Book: \"God's Way\" What People Are Saying \"Having been recently diagnosed with brain cancer, I reached out to Dr Ibrahim Jaffe and his team for Spiritual Support and Healing. The inward and outward transformation I've experienced since that time is beyond words. I was terrified, deeply resentful, and full of doubt. It felt like my life had literally been taken away. In the next month with ongoing support from Dr Jaffe I have been filled with longing for the divine, pervasive love and assurance, and abiding trust. Those qualities have made my world fundamentally better. This does not even reflect the miraculous outcomes that my symptoms resolved within 3 weeks, my tumor did not grow at all on follow-up imaging, and my cancer was deemed benign rather than the initial suspicion that it was malignant!!!\" \"I would like to express my gratitude for the most awe inspiring exclusively dynamic teachings. Drinking the nectar of Divine Love is absolutely Profound. The perception of togetherness and oneness has already impacted extremely positively in the lives of many, as I could not contain myself and started implementing these concepts to some couples who are battling with marital problems The results are totally metamorphic. It's like magic wands being waved by Mala'ikah Alhamdulillahi Rabbil Aalameen I have a small space where I practice from but it's a little Zawia where constant learning and Thikrs are taking place Alhamdulillah Dr Jaffe, I thank thee in all humility for my deep walking and my transformed heart which has become humungous with expansion through the Divine love\" \"I am so grateful for all that I received during my time at the Institute of Spiritual Healing. It wasn't only the teachings and practices that helped me to make lasting changes in my life, but it was also the sense of community that developed with my classmates and mentors that enabled me to walk through many difficulties with my hope intact and my heart open. I cannot say how much this has made a difference in my life. I never thought that I could feel this close to God again and to feel at home in my body. The friendships I made along the way help me to remember what is most important. If you are longing for real peace inside, this is the place to start!\" \"I'm writing to share my experience with Dr. Ibrahim Jaffe's spiritual healing practice. In my case, I was working to heal a traumatic series of events that occurred when I was a young child\u2014so traumatic that I blocked them for over 50 years. They warped me, crippled my relationships with those close to me, and undermined my professional development. It wasn't until I embarked upon the Sufi path that my wife and I encountered through the teaching of Dr. Jaffe that it became important to finally address the issues resulting from this trauma. Through the guidance provided in his spiritual healing method, I have been able to identify, re- experience, and ultimately clear these issues...\" The Institute of Spiritual Healing (ISH) offers various courses and trainings to help teach these methods. Specialized courses are taught on Self-Healing\u2014utilizing the APIIR-TB System, otherwise known as Illuminated Spiritual Healing, for professional practitioners seeking a Healer Certification in this SH, and to those students interested in personal transformation through Sufi Spiritual walking.
