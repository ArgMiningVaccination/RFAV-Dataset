It is considered that vaccine platforms enabling endogenous synthesis of RSV immunogens would induce favorable immune responses than non-replicating subunit vaccines in avoiding VED. Here, we investigated the immunogenicity, protection, and disease in mice after vaccination with RSV fusion protein (F) encoding plasmid DNA (F-DNA) or virus-like particles presenting RSV F vaccination CD8 T cells and RSV neutralizing Abs, whereas F-VLP elicited higher levels of IgG2a isotype and neutralizing Abs, and germinal center B cells, contributing to protection by controlling lung viral loads after RSV challenge. However, mice that were immunized with F-DNA displayed weight loss and pulmonary histopathology, and induced F specific CD8 T cell responses and recruitment of monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells into the lungs. These innate immune parameters, RSV disease, and pulmonary histopathology were lower in mice that were immunized with F-VLP after challenge. This study provides important insight into developing effective and safe RSV vaccines.

Human trials of formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) vaccines resulted in disastrous consequences of causing vaccine-enhanced disease (VED) during winter season ( 3).

DNA vaccines direct the production of mRNA and endogenously synthesize the vaccine proteins in vivo , subjecting to host post-translational modifications and making an authentic immunogen. This in vivo synthesis of RSV F proteins by DNA vaccines attributes the induction of Th1 profile immune responses of IgG2a isotype and Abs T cells ( 7). RSV F-DNA boost vaccination shown to switch preexisting Th2 anti-F responses toward Th1 type immune responses ( 7). Mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing RSV attachment glycoprotein G (r-vaccinia G) were shown to develop eosinophilia similar to FI-RSV vaccination, whereas r-vaccinia F immunization of mice did not induce pulmonary eosinophils upon RSV challenge ( 8,9). Despite the difference in pulmonary eosinophil infiltration, r-vaccinia G or F immunization of mice displayed enhanced RSV disease such as weight loss after challenge ( 10-13). Strong induction of IFN- responses representing a Th1 profile was observed in mice with r-vaccinia G or F immunization ( 12-15). Thus, both endogenous and exogenous expression of RSV immunogens may have the potential to cause VED after RSV challenge. However, it is less well known whether RSV F-DNA vaccination would induce VED upon RSV challenge. Virus-like particle vaccines presenting RSV F alone (F-VLP) were demonstrated to confer protection against RSV without displaying VED in mice ( 16,17). Since gene-based in vivo immunogen synthesizing approaches are considered as an RSV vaccine platform, it is important to better understand protection and disease after RSV F-DNA vaccination. In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity, protection, VED, and histopathology in a mouse model after vaccination with F-DNA, F-VLP, or FI-RSV followed by RSV challenge. This study suggests that F-DNA vaccine is less immunogenic and protective, causing overt weight loss and pulmonary histopathology compared to F-VLP upon RSV challenge in mice. Potential immune parameters possibly correlated with RSV disease were investigated and discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells, virus, and RSV vaccines The RSV A2 strain was originally gifted from Dr. Barney Graham. Hep-2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in DMEM media. The expression plasmid encoding a full-length RSV A2 F in previous studies ( 18,19). F-VLP vaccine was produced in insect cells by co- expressing RSV F and influenza virus matrix 1 (M1) core protein and characterized as previously described ( 20). Briefly, Sf9 insect cells were co-transfected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing M1 and RSV F protein in serum-free SF900-II medium. The culture supernatants were collected by centrifugation (6,000 rpm, 20 min) to remove insect cells. The cleared supernatants containing F-VLPs were purified by ultracentrifugation. The purified F-VLPs were resuspended in PBS. F-DNA vaccine was purified using Qiagen Plasmid Mega Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cells, formalin (1:4,000 vol/vol) for 3 days at 37\u00b0C, purified using ultracentrifugation to remove cell culture supernatants and cellular proteins, and finally confirmed by a modified immuno-plaque assay as previously described ( 20). Briefly, the infected Hep-2 cell plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 for 16 h and then viral supernatants were removed. After 2/13 https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2019.19.e18Protective Efficacy of RSV of 1% agarose and DMEM media, the infected Hep-2 cell plates were further incubated for 3 days, the infected Hep-2 cell plates were fixed with 10% formalin and then overlay agarose was removed. Viral plaques by RSV A2 were immune-stained with 131 -2a monoclonal Ab and DAB substrate (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Vaccination, sample collection, and virus challenge For F-VLP and F-DNA vaccine groups, BALB/c mice (6 to 8 wk old, n=5, duplicate) were intramuscularly primed and boosted with 20 g F-VLP or 100 g plasmid F-DNA at 0, 3 wk. Second boost vaccination was followed with a half dose of F-VLP (10 g) or F-DNA (50 g) respectively at wk 6. The FI-RSV control group was intramuscularly primed (wk 0) and boosted (wk 3) with FI-RSV (2 g) in alum (50 \u00b5g) adjuvant. Each group of immunization and challenge experiments was duplicated. Na\u00efve or vaccinated mice were challenged intranasally with RSV A2 strain (3.3\u00d7105 PFU, plaque-forming units) 20 after boost. The individual lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected day 5 post-challenge to determine inflammatory cellular responses ( 17,18). All animal experiments were approved by the Georgia State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC A18001) and performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Assays for Ab responses, RSV neutralizing activity, and lung viral titers RSV specific Abs (IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a) were determined by ELISA using RSV F protein antigen (BEI) and presented in concentrations based on standard IgG and isotypes as described ( 17). Neutralizing Ab titers in mouse sera were measured using the red fluorescent RSV A2-K-line19F (200 PFU per well) and lung an immunoplaque assay as described ( 21,22). Pulmonary histology of RSV-infected Individual lungs were immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with H&E, periodic acid-Schiff stain (PAS) or hematoxylin and congo red (H&CR) as described ( 22-24). For numerical assessment of histopathology and pneumonia in lung tissues, the bronchioles, vessels and interstitial space were initially scored on a scale of 0-3 by blinded observers with the severity scoring system as previously described ( 23,25). A score 1 was assigned when the epithelial lines, vessels, and interstitial surrounding spaces have few infiltrating cells, a score 2 when the epithelial lines and surrounding spaces contain focal aggregates of infiltrating cells or the structure is cuffed by one definite layer of infiltrating cells, and a score 3 when structure is obviously cuffed by two or more definite layers of infiltrating cells with focal aggregates. Cell preparations and flow cytometry BALFs were harvested from the lung airways by infusion with PBS via trachea using a 25-gauge catheter ( 26). Lung tissues were homogenized, passed through a cell strainer, and spun on 44/67% Percoll gradients to collect lung cells. Cellular phenotypes were determined by flow cytometric analysis using cell surface marker Abs CA, USA or BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA) as previously described ( 17,27,28). Cells from BALF and lungs were stimulated with the synthetic F 85-93 (KYKNAVTEL) peptide ( 29) for CD8 stained with monoclonal IFN- and TNF- and cell phenotypic marker Abs were acquired by the Becton-Dickinson LSR-II/Fortessa flow cytometer and data analyzed by Flowjo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). In the determination of cellular phenotypes, the fraction (%) of each cell phenotypes obtained by https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2019.19.e18Protective Efficacy of RSV F-VLP and F-DNA https://immunenetwork.orgflow cytometry was multiplied by the total cell numbers counted in the cell preparations from the lung tissues and BALF. Statistical analysis Results are expressed as mean\u00b1SEM; statistical significance was calculated by one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's Multiple Comparison test using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS F-VLP or F-DNA immunization induces IgG2a isotype dominant Ab responses compare the immunogenicity of exogenous F-VLP and endogenous F-DNA vaccine platforms, RSV F protein antigen-specific Abs were determined in immune sera from immunized mice ( Fig. 1 ). Prime dose of F-DNA vaccine induced low levels of RSV F specific IgG Abs, requiring multiple immunizations. Whereas, the F-VLP group of mice induced substantial levels of IgG and IgG2a isotype Abs specific for RSV F protein after prime immunization. Significant levels of RSV F protein specific IgG and IgG2a Abs were induced after second boost with F-DNA vaccine although they were lower than those induced by F-VLP boost ( Fig. 1A-C dominant Ab responses (Fig. 1B ) as evidenced by high IgG2a/IgG1 ratios of Ab responses ( Fig. 1D ).

RSV neutralizing activity as measured by reduction percentages of fluorescent RSV virus infection and plaque assays was observed at higher levels in both immune sera from the F-VLP and F-DNA groups activity ( Fig. 1E ). F-DNA immunization causes RSV disease of weight loss after challenge To assess the protective efficacy of F-VLP and F-DNA vaccines, immunized mice were challenged with RSV A2 at 20 wk after second boost. F-VLP immunized mice did not show body weight loss, but approximately 10% body weight loss was observed in the na\u00efve mice infected with RSV (Na\u00efve inf, Fig. 2A ). In contrast, F-DNA weight loss up to 15% ( Fig. 2A ). The highest RSV titers in lungs were detected in unvaccinated na\u00efve mice on day 5 post infection ( Fig. 2B ). Approximately 10-fold lower lung RSV titers were observed in F-DNA immune mice compared to na\u00efve infection mice, significantly clearing lung viral loads. The F-VLP group lowered lung viral titers by over 200 folds near to the detection limit ( Fig. 2B ). The alum adjuvanted FI-RSV group effectively cleared lung viral loads below the detection limit ( Fig. 2B ). F-DNA vaccination induces infiltrating histopathology upon RSV challenge The lung tissue sections were examined by staining with H&E, PAS, or H&CR at 5 days after RSV challenge ( Figs. 3 and 4). As expected, mice that were immunized with FI-RSV showed the highest degree of pulmonary histopathology. After RSV challenge, F-DNA vaccination was found to induce significant infiltrates in the interstitial spaces of the lungs, which were similar to or slightly lower than FI-RSV ( Fig. 3A and B ). Moderate levels of infiltrates were observed in the blood vessels and airways from F-DNA immune mice ( Fig. 3D ). Meanwhile unvaccinated na\u00efve mice exhibited moderately higher levels of infiltrating histopathology in the interstitial spaces after RSV infection ( Fig. 3A and B ). F-VLP immune mice did not show overt histopathology infiltrates upon RSV infection. Mucus production and eosinophilia are also considered RSV disease parameters.

The na\u00efve and F-VLP groups did not display PAS positive spots and eosinophils in the lung sections ( Fig. 4A and C ) Inflammatory innate immune cells are recruited into the lungs in F-DNA immune mice upon RSV challenge Cellular phenotypes in lung ( Fig. 5 ) and BALF ( Fig. 6 ) were analyzed by flow cytometry using cell type-specific marker Abs at 5 days after RSV challenge. Alum-adjuvanted FI-RSV immune mice showed the highest levels of eosinophils (CD11b+CD11cSiglecF+) in lung and BALF samples as cells (pDC, B220+CD11c+F4/80) BALF. monocytes (CD11b+F4/80+Ly6Chigh), eosinophils, and pDC in the compared F-VLP or na\u00efve infection mice. Particularly, eosinophil and monocyte populations were increased by approximately 3-fold in F-DNA mice than those in F-VLP mice. We also observed increased levels in monocytes and pDCs in airway BALF samples from F-DNA immunized mice, compared to those in F VLP ( Fig. 6 ). F-DNA is effective in inducing Th1 CD8 T cells whereas F-VLP in activating B cells upon RSV challenge We determined the levels of CD8 T cells producing IFN- and/or TNF- cytokines in the lungs at 5 days after RSV challenge by a flow cytometry assay of intracellular cytokine staining.

The F VLP group showed certain levels of IgA Abs in BALF but not the F-DNA group, but overall the IgA Ab levels were very low and no significant levels of IgM Ab levels were detected (data not shown). DISCUSSION Since the failure of alum-adjuvanted FI-RSV vaccine, non-replicating RSV subunit vaccine platforms would have potential safety concerns of causing VED in young na\u00efve children. Here, we compared the immunogenicity, protection, and immunopathology of a full-length F-DNA vaccine for vivo endogenous expression or an exogenous RSV F protein. Both RSV F-VLP and DNA vaccines were capable of inducing IgG2a RSV 4. F-DNA immune mice display moderate eosinophilia after challenge. (A) Mucus positive PAS staining (scale bars, 100 \u00b5m).

F-VLP was more effective in controlling RSV loads than F-DNA. Unexpectedly, the mice with F-DNA vaccination showed substantial weight loss and pulmonary histopathology compared to F-VLP immune or na\u00efve mice after RSV infection. The results in this study suggest that RSV immunity in mice induced by endogenous expression of RSV F does not necessarily avoid VED after RSV infection. The nature of endogenous synthesis of the vaccine immunogen by DNA vaccines engenders the induction of relatively weak humoral and strong cellular immune responses. RSV F specific Abs were not detected after prime with F-DNA probably due to low transgene transduction and thus multiple F-DNA immunizations required to induce substantial levels of antigen specific IgG Abs. Despite relatively low levels of IgG Abs, significant reductions of lung RSV titers were reported with soluble secreted F protein-encoding DNA vaccination being 10-fold more effective than transmembrane F protein-encoding plasmid (7). Low efficacy of lung RSV clearance in the F-DNA group might be due to the expression of membrane-anchored form. However, pulmonary inflammation was observed in animal models with F-DNA ( 7,30), FI-RSV ( 7), and soluble F protein ( 31) vaccines despite significant clearance of lung RSV loads or below the detection limit. Different platforms of RSV vaccines influence the cellular phenotypes infiltrating into the lungs upon RSV challenge. FI-RSV or r-vaccinia G-immunized mice were shown to upon RSV challenge ( 29,32). Substantial RSV histopathology was previously reported in mice with RSV F DNA vaccination despite the induction of 5.

Particularly in a recent study by Ma et al. ( 30), the groups of mice were immunized 4 times with 30 \u00b5g of F DNA vaccines containing 5 or 20 copies of built- in CpG immune stimulating motifs. Ma et al. ( 30) demonstrated that the pVAX1-F (5CpG motifs) group displayed a similar pattern of weight loss (>10%) as the PBS control after RSV challenge, whereas the pVAX1-F (20CpG motifs) group showed a moderate level of weight loss (<9%). In this study, we found that the F-DNA (no CpG motif ) group and FI-RSV control group exhibited a substantial weight loss (>10%), which is similar to the PBS and pVAX1-F (5CpG motifs) group in the Ma et al.'s study ( 30). It is speculated that the overall outcomes in body weight changes after RSV challenge are similar but subtle differences might be due to the nature of F DNA vectors, doses, and immunization regimen between the two studies. RSV F or G DNA vaccination was previously reported to infiltrate pulmonary eosinophils, NK cells, and neutrophils but histopathology was not investigated ( 33). F-DNA vaccine exhibited slightly higher levels of eosinophils than F-VLP vaccine after RSV challenge. However, the levels of eosinophils in the F-DNA group were significantly lower than those in FI-RSV immune mice after RSV challenge. F-DNA immune mice showed a Th1 pattern of immune responses (high IFN- , low IL-4, Supplementary Fig. 1 ), consistent with a pattern reported by Ma et al. ( 30). High eosinophils in the FI-RSV group were consistent with Th2 cytokine levels. Monocytes from the bone marrow traffic to peripheral tissues via the bloodstream in response to a signal of inflammation and play an important role in clearing pathogens ( 34). Additionally, extensive monocytes can contribute to immunopathology and degenerative disease ( 34). The pDCs are known to be important for 9/13 https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2019.19.e18Protective inflammatory innate cells and CD8 T cells in BALF after challenge.

Other studies reported that high levels of pDCs are involved in severe RSV disease and elevated mortality during influenza virus infection ( 37,38). Levels of pDCs infiltrating into the lungs were shown to be correlated with FI-RSV VED ( 39). NK cells enhance CD8 T cells expressing IFN- and NK cell depletion was shown to attenuate weight loss during RSV infection ( 40,41). Consistent with previous studies, this study suggests that recruiting NK cells, monocytes, pDCs, and eosinophils at high levels in F-DNA immune mice contribute to pulmonary histopathology during RSV infection. There was no significant difference in the levels of IL-4 cytokines in lung cells in response to stimulation with CD4 T and CD8 T cell epitopes between the F-DNA and F-VLP groups (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Unbalanced high levels of CD8 T cell responses could induce significant immunopathology. Vaccination of mice with r-vaccinia G and M2, or M2 82-90 peptide in adjuvants inducing strong CD8 T cell responses was shown to cause severe weight loss after RSV challenge (29,42,43). Excess induction of IFN- + T cell responses was shown to cause immune-mediated pathology in response to RSV infection ( 13,43-45). Also, high levels of TNF- + CD8 T cells were indicated to be an indicator for severity of pulmonary disease such as weight loss ( 46,47). In line with previous findings, F-DNA immune mice induced high levels of RSV F specific IFN- + and TNF-+ CD8 T cells in the lungs, compared to F-VLP, FI-RSV immune or na\u00efve mice upon RSV challenge, suggesting a potential correlation with RSV disease. Interestingly, our previous studies reported that inclusion of F-DNA in the RSV F+G VLP vaccination was effective in controlling lung viral titers and preventing pulmonary histopathology ( 18,22,24). An appropriate balance of inducing CD8 T cells together with RSV neutralizing Abs would be important for conferring desirable protection avoiding VED during RSV infection.
