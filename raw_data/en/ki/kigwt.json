Methods of Naturopathic Medicine BOTANICAL MEDICINE Plants are medicine. Some of the strongest prescribed medications were originally-and still are-formulated from botanically-based plants. Naturopathic doctors are trained in botanicals. Botanicals are used in similar context as medical doctors use drugs. However, naturopathic doctors attempt to stimulate the immune system and restore homeostasis and not suppress. Botanicals given in the wrong dose have the potential to suppress and be toxic. It is of the utmost importance importance to work with a qualified professional. HOMEOPATHY Homeopathy is a natural system of medicine which gives relief from suffering to millions of people in nearly every country in the world. It is based on the practice \"like with like.\" The practice of homeopathy treats the whole person as an individual, rather than treating the disease alone. It should be noted that it is not unlikely for clients with the same condition to be treated with different remedies. Homeopathy works as a healing process where medicines stimulate and encourage the body's natural healing forces of recovery. The principle of treating \"like with like\" is based on treating an illness with a substance that produces, in a healthy person, similar symptoms to those experienced in the sick person. Conventional medicine believes that symptoms are caused by the illness; whereas homeopathy and naturopathic medicine see the symptoms as the body's natural reaction in fighting the illness and seek to stimulate, rather than suppress them. Homeopathic medicines are completely safe with no unwanted side effects or contraindications. They are non-addictive, safe for babies, children and people of all ages. Hydrotherapy Hydrotherapy is the use of alternating hot and cold water treatments to achieve vasoconstriction and dilation of blood vessels. This process helps the body move lymph and nutrients to focus on healing specific areas of the body. Hydrotherapy can easily be taught to family members for home care. It is very inexpensive to use, but highly effective in its outcome. Nutrition The foods we consume have direct correlations to bodily function and well-being. Nutrition is comprehensively discussed during the consultation between the naturopathic doctors and the client. Often a food intake diary is utilized. This creates a comprehensive picture of potential sensitivities that may be exacerbating conditions. Sometimes the most common food sources can precipitate symptoms which, when removed from the diet, improve overall health and well-being.
