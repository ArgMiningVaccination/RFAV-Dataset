I was a lil nerves because I was still soar from surgery but she was so delicate and she did not clock watch, she was more in tune with my body and working all the kinks out . When I say it was excellent service with a smile I will for sure return again and again. - 5/16/2018First to Review I have been dealing with chronic fatigue and exhaustion. I did a search on the internet and found Dr. Shelley at the Institute. I have also had Insomnia off and on. After meeting with Dr. Shelley she recommended a homeopathic for my thyroid, sleep, and cleansing of my liver. My energy has gotten better and I can do more of my daily chores. I am looking forward to seeing more improvement. I am so happy to find natural therapies that can help me. - 3/25/2019 Laura Lopez is so incredible. I was under a lot of stress and wanted/needed a message. I was able to speak to her by phone before the appointment and explained that I had not been sleeping well for months... four to five hours of interrupted sleep a night. She listened and recommended both a sacral cranio and regular massage. I asked for 90 minutes. When I got to the Institute she welcomed me and was the sweetest and kindest person. Once she began I became so relaxed.... more than relaxed. She found areas that were sore and worked on them and helped release any tension. She has eyes in her hands and can sense soreness, areas of pain, areas that need work and areas that are out of alignment. The sacral cranio was beyond great. It felt great and I was so relaxed when I left. That night I slept for nine hours straight, the first time in months. Laura is a true intuitive healer. I went to her for a second appointment two weeks later with the same result. On top of her amazing gifts and abilities is a passion for what she does. She is so excited about her work and loves learning and sharing what she learns. I recommend her so highly.
