SUBHA GAN GULY Editor -in-Chief Knowlegde for Global Development 1 CHAPTER ONE HERBAL IMMUNE ENHANCE RS AND INDIGENOUS HE RBS, PLANTS AND FRUITS AN D ITS TRADITIONAL IMPLICAT IONS IN THERAPY INCL UDING ALTERNATIVE ME DICINE TO READERS Subha Ganguly, Editor -in-Chief (FSEDInst) AICRP on Post Harvest Technology (ICAR), Department of Fish Processing Technology, Faculty of Fishery Sciences, West Bengal University of Animal and Fishery Sciences, 5, Budherhat Road, P.O. Panchasayar, Chakgaria, Kolkata - 700 094, WB, India ABSTRACT A herbal immunomodulator is a subst ance which stimulates or suppresses the components of immune system including both innate and adaptive immune responses (Agarwal and Singh 1969). The modulation of immune system by various medicinal plant products has become a subject for scientific invest igations currently worldwide. KEY WORDS : Herbal immunomodulator, Medicinal plants INTRODUCTION Under Indian scenario, poultry industry has become a means for earning livelihood for the economically distressed farmers in India due to its promising result s in productivity and National economy. Poultry rearing is currently the fastest growing industry in our National livestock sector which is benefiting us from production and advantages in prices along with provision of proteinacous food. Mode of action i n immunostimulation of different herbal extracts Many herbal plant preparations are prescribed to strengthen host resistance (Thatte and Dahanukar 1986). Many useful plants fall under this category. They exhibit immunomodulatory activities. One such plant , Tinospora cordifolia , commonly called Guduchi has been examined for its immunomodulatory properties. Guduchi means to rejuvenate dead cells. It is widely used in veterinary folk medicine and has also been claimed to be beneficial according to Ayurveda for the cure of jaundice, skin diseases, diabetes, anemia, emaciations and various infections for its anti -spasmodic, anti - inflammatory, anti -arthritic and anti -allergic properties (Chopra et al. 1982). It has also been reported that it improves the phag ocytic and bactericidal activities in patients suffering from polymorphism in surgical jaundice (Thatte at al. 1989). Kolte et al. (2007) studied the effect of feeding T. cordifolia in broiler birds which were immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide. They h ad found a significant rise in antibody titer against ND virus with augmentation of inflammatory reaction to skin contact sensitivity test. Rege Knowlegde for Global Development 2 et al. (1989) and Bishavi et al. (2002) have proved the hepato -protective effect of T. cordifolia. Manjrekar et al. (1999) also found that aqueous extract of T. cordifolia is capable of increasing leukocyte count in mice. Also, Ocimum sanctum , commonly known as tulsi is also used in Ayurveda for various ailments including treatment of allergies. The plant has be en reported to evince significant anti -stress properties. The beneficial effects of O. sanctum could therefore be due to its direct or indirect effect on the immune system. O. sanctum has been reported to modulate humoral immune response by releasing media tors for hypersensitivity 2003). Withania somnifera also fall in this category with many other useful plants. They exhibit immunomodulatory activities. Withania somnifera (commonly called Ashwagandh a) anti -estrogenic, adaptogenic, anti -cancer and anabolic activities having beneficial effects in the treatment of arthritis, geriatric problems and stress. The root of Asparagus racemosus (commonly called Satavar) possess anti -diarrheal, anti - ulcerative, anti -spasmodic, aphrodisiac, galactogogue and other properties and has therefore gained its importance in Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani systems of medicine (Nadkarni, 1954). It has been observed that feeding W. somnifera and A. racemo sus dried root powder significantly stimulates both humoral and cell mediated immune responses in swiss albino mice by Kuttan and Kuttan (1992). W. somnifera and A. racemosus extracts increase phagocytic activities of macrophages in vitro (Rege and Dahanuk ar 1993). There have been studies on the immunomodulatory activities of W. somnifera and A. racemosus in mice with myelo -suppression induced by cyclophosphamide, azathioprim or prednisolone. Extracts of somnifera and A. racemosus have also shown immunop otentiating effects in cyclophasphamide treated mouse with ascitic sarcoma (Diwanay et al. 2004). Kalita and Dutta (1999) reported that maternal antibody was persistently found in sera samples tested against ND virus during the first week of age in broiler s. This was attributed to transfer of natural passive immunity in young chicks as demonstrated by Hellar (1975). Muruganandan et al. (2001) reported the effects of ethanolic extracts of W. somnifera and A. racemosus on humoral immune system which was asses sed by humoral immune response and cell mediated immune response in mice. CONCLUSION The use of various plant extracts and herbal fed additives in a specific dose during the scheduled vaccination regimen may be helpful in obtaining higher protective anti body against different infections including production and development of more effective cell mediate immune response for protection against various bacterial, viral and other diseases. Herbal formulation may be therefore recommended for use as positive immunomodulator in normal and immunocompromized susceptible animals and birds.

Knowlegde for Global Development 6 CHAPTER TWO COMPARTMENT OF PLANT CELL Md. Rageeb Md. Usman Department of Pharmacognosy, Smt. Chopda, Mahar ashtra, A. PLANT TISSUE Types of plant issue Meristematic tissue Apical meristems Lateral meristems tissue (phellem) Meristematic tissue Apical meristems These are situated at the growing tip of the stems & roots, i.e., at shoot apex & root apex. Apical meristems are also found at apices of the leaves. It brings about the elongation of the root & stem. It results in increase in th e height of the plant, which is called primary growth. Lateral meristems These are found beneath the bark (cork cambium) & in vascular bundles of dicot roots & stems (cambium).They occurs in thin layers. Cambium is the region which is responsible for grow th in thickness. It causes the organ (stem or root) to increase in diameter & girth. This is called secondary growth. Knowlegde for Global Development 7 Intercalary meristems They are located at the base of leaves or internodes, e.g., Stem of grasses & other monocots. It produces an incre ase of length of organ. Meristematic Tissue Nature -cells of meristems divide continuously & help in increasing the length girth of the plant. These cells show the following characteristics: 1. The cells of meristematic tissue are similar in structure & have thin cellulose cell walls. 2. The meristematic cells may be spherical, oval, polygonal or rectangular in shape. 3. The meristematic cells are compactly arranged & do not contain any intercel lular space between them. 4. Each meristematic cell contains dense or abundant cytoplasm & a single large nucleus. 5. The meristematic cells contain few vacuoles or no vacuoles at all. 6. Occurrence -Meristematic tissues are growth tissues & are found in those regions of the plant that grow. According to their position in the plant, meristems are apical, lateral & intercalary. 7. Function -the main function of meristematic tissue is to continuously form a number of new cells. Permanent tissue These tissu es derived from the meristematic tissues but their cells have lost the power of division & have attained their definite forms. Permanent tissues are classified into two-simple & complex. Simple permanent tissue These tissues are composed of cells which ar e structurally & functionally similar. Thus, these tissues are all made of one type of cells. Knowlegde for Global Development 8 They are of three types I. Parenchyma II. Collenchyma III. Sclerenchyma Complex permanent tissue The complex tissues consist of more than one type of cells. All this co -ordinate to perform a common function. Complex tissues transport water, mineral salts (nutrients) & food material to various parts of plant body. Complex tissues are of following two types: I. Xylem or wood II. Phloem or bast Xylem & phloem are bo th conducting tissues & also known as vascular tissues; together both of them constitute vascular bundles. Simple permanent tissue 1. Parenchyma Living & possess the power of their division. The cells are rounded or isodiametric, i.e., equally expanded on al l sides. The parenchymatous cells are oval, round, polygonal or elongated in shape. The cell wall is thin & encloses a dense cytoplasm which contains a small nucleus & surrounds a large central vacuole. In other words, parenchyma cells have living protopla sm. Intercellular spaces are abundant Occurrence The parenchyma is widely distributed in plant body such as stem, roots. Leaves, flowers & fruits. Thus, the parenchyma tissue is found in the soft parts of the plant such as cortex of roots, ground tissues in stems & mesophyll of leaves. It is also distributed in pith, medullary rays & packing tissue in xylem & phloem. Functions 1. Parenchyma serves as a packing tissue to fill the spaces between other tissues & maintain the shape & firmness of the plant du e to its turgid cells. 2. Due to turgidity property, parenchyma forms the main means of support to the stem of herbaceous plants. 3. The main function of parenchyma is to store & assimilate food. Parenchyma serves as food storage tissue. 4. Transport of materials occurs through cells or cell walls of parenchyma cells. 5. Parenchyma cells are metabolically active their intercellular air spaces allow gaseous exchange. Knowlegde for Global Development 9 Parenchyma 2. Collenchyma Nature -collenchyma tissue consists of living cells. It shows many of the features of parenchyma but is characterised by the deposition of extra cellulose at the corners of the cells. In collenchyma, intercellular spaces are generally absent. Collenchymas cells are elongated in shape. They often conta in a few chloroplasts. Occurrence The cells of collenchyma are located below the epidermis of dicotyledons stem & petiole. These cells also occur in midribs of dicot leaves. Collenchyma is absent in monocot stems, roots & leaves. Functions Collenchyma is a mechanical tissue; it provides mechanical support & elasticity. Thus, collenchyma provides tensile strength with flexibility to those organs in which it is found. It allows easy bending in various parts of a plant without actually breaking it. When cell s of collenchyma contain some chloroplasts, they manufacture sugar & starch. Collenchyma Knowlegde for Global Development 10 Sclerenchyma Nature -sclerenchyma cells are dead cells & they are devoid of protoplasm. The walls of cells of sclerenchyma are greatly thickened with deposition of lignin. Such cells are called lignified. Due to excessive thickening of the wall of a sclerenchyma cells, its cell cavity or lumen becomes nearly absent. The cells of sclerenchyma are closely packed without intercellular spaces. Occurrence The sclerenchyma occurs in abundance either in patches or definite layers. They are found in stems, roots, veins of leaves, hard covering of seeds & nuts. Sclereids form the gritty part of the most of the ripe fruits & contribute hardness to the seed coat & nutshells. Functions The sclerenchyma is mainly mechanical & protective in function. It gives strength, rigidity, exibility & elasticity to the plant body &, thus, enables it to withstand various strains. Sclerenchyma Complex per manent tissue Xylem Nature -xylem is a vascular & mechanical tissue. In other words, it is a conducting tissue. Xylem is composed of cells of four different types like, are dead & bounded by thick lignified walls. Of these four types of cells of xylem are most important cells are vessels. Vessels are very long tube -like structures formed by a row of cells placed end to end. Tracheids are elo ngated cells with tapering ends. They conduct water. Functions Knowlegde for Global Development 11 The main function of xylem is to carry water & minerals salts upward from the root to different parts of shoots. Since walls of tracheids, vessels & sclerenchyma of xylem are lignified, they g ive mechanical strength to the plant body. Xylem Phloem Nature -like xylem, it contains tubes but has no mechanical function. Phloem is composed of following four elements or cells like, sieve tubes, compa nion cells, living cells. Functions Phloem transport photosynthetically prepared food materials from the leaves to the storage organs & later from storage organs to the growi ng regions of the plant body. Phloem Vascular Bundles with Xylem & Phloem Protective tissue Epidermis It is usually present in the outermost layer of the plant body such as leaves, flowers, stem & roo ts. Epidermis is one cell thick & is covered with cuticle. Cuticle is a water proof layer of a waxy substance called cutin which is secreted by epidermal cells. Cuticles possess variable thickness in plants such as it is thicker in xerophytic plants. Knowlegde for Global Development 12 Cells of epidermis are elongated & flattened & do not contain any intercellular space between them. Their inner contents are similar to parenchyma cells. The main function of epidermis is to protect the plant from desiccation & infection. In fact, cuticle of e pidermis helps to reduce water loss by evaporation from the plant surface as well as helping in preventing the entry of pathogens Epidermis Cork As plants grow older, the outer protective tissue undergoes certain changes. A strip of secondary meristems, called phellogen or cork cambium replaces epidermis of stem. Cork cambium is a simple tissue having only one type of cells. The cells of cork cambium are rectangular & their protoplasts are vacuolated & contain tannins & chloroplasts. Cork cambium gives off new cells on its both sides, thus, forming cork on the outer side & the secondary cortex or Phelloderm on the inner side. The layer of cells which is cut by cork cambium on the outer side ultimately becomes several layered thick cor k or the bark of trees. Cells of cork are dead & compactly arranged without intercellular spaces. The walls of cork cells are heavily thickened by deposition of an organic substance, called suberin. Suberin makes these cells impermeable to water & gases. T he cork cells do not contain protoplasm but are filled with resin or tannins. In case of onion bulb too, in the skin of onion the cell walls become thick & water proof due to addition of suberin. Cork is protective in function. Cork cells prevent desiccati on, infection & mechanical Cork Knowlegde for Global Development 13 B. THE CELL The elementary organs from which the body of the plant is constructed are the cells. Most plants (all the more highly organized ones) consist of numerous cells. Among the lower plant s there are, however, many which arc formed of but single cells, some of which assume the most manifold forms, branch abundantly, and, indeed, without being in any manner divided by lateral walls, imitate a stem, leaf, and root. Contains of the Cell Cell-contents with the distinction already made the cell contents may be grouped into two classes: (1) Protoplasmic, or those in which the life -processes of the plant, or cell, are manifested, and (2) non -protoplasmic, or those which are the direct or indir ect products of the protoplast. The first class includes the protoplasm with its various differentiated parts, and the second, the various carbohydrates (starches and sugars), calcium, oxalate, aleurone, tannin, oil, and a number of other substances. Cell Wall It is rigid wall made up of cellulose, proteins, and carbohydrates Function: boundary around the plant cell outside of the cell membrane that provides structure and support Protoplasm Knowlegde for Global Development 14 Protoplasm occurs as a more or less semi fluid, slimy, granular, or foam -like substance, which lies close to the walls of the cell as a relatively thin layer and surrounding a large central cavity or vacuole filled with cell -sap. or it may be distributed in the form of threads or bands forming a kind of network enclosi ng smaller vacuoles. Protoplasm consists of two comparatively well differentiated portions: (1) Certain more or less distinct bodies which appear to have particular functions and to which a great deal of study has been given, as the nucleus and plastids, a nd (2) a less dense portion which may be looked upon as the ground substance of the protoplast and which is now commonly referred to as the cytoplasm. These differentiated bodies and the cytoplasm are intimately associated and interdependent. The nucleus and cytoplasm are present in all living cells and it is through their special activities that cell division takes place. When in addition plastids are present, constructive metabolism takes place, whereby complex substances are formed from simpler ones. Be sides the nucleus and plastids other protoplasmic structures are sometimes found embedded in the cytoplasm Centrospheres Small spherical bodies are associated with the nucleus and appear to be concerned in cell division. There are in fact quite a number of minute bodies in the cytoplasm which may be always present or only under certain conditions, and which are grouped under the general name of microsomes or microsomata. Chemically protoplasm is an extremely complex substance, but does not appear to have a definite molecular structure of its own, being composed in large measure of proteins, a class of organic compounds which always contain nitrogen, and frequently phosphorus and sulphur. The molecule of the proteins is large and more or less unstable, and hence subject to rapid changes and a variety of combinations, and it is to these interactions that the vital activities of the plant are attributed Nucleus. The nucleus consists of a ground substance in which is embedded a network composed of threads cont aining a granular material known as chromatin, and generally one or more spherical bodies called nucleoles, the while being enclosed by a delicate membrane. The chromatin threads are readily stained by some of the aniline dyes, and are mainly composed of n ucleins (proteins) rich in phosphorus, which by some writers are supposed to be essential constituents of the nucleus and necessary to the life of the protoplast. Chromatin is constant in the nucleus and prior to cell division the threads become organized into bodies of a definite number and shape known as chromosomes. Plastids The plastids or chromatoid hores form a group of differentiated protoplasmic bodies found in the cytoplasm (Frontispiece) and are associated with it in the building up of complex organic compounds, as starch, oil and proteins. The term chromatophore Knowlegde for Global Development 15 means colour -bearer, but applies also to those plastids which may be colourless at one stage and pigmented at another. Hence we may speak of colourless chromatophores. According to the position of the cells in which these bodies occur and the functions they perform, they vary in colour three distinct kinds being recognized. (1) In the egg -cell and in the cells of roots, rhizomes and seeds the plastids are colourless and are called leuc oplastids. (2) When they occur in cells which are more or less exposed to light and produce the green pigment called chlorophyll, they are known as chloroplastid or chloroplasts. (3) In other cases, independently of the position of the cells as to light or darkness, the plastids develop a yellowish or orange -colored principle, which may be termed chlorophyll, and are known as chromoplastids. Chromo plastids. Chloroplastid is found in all plants except Fungi and non -chlorophyllous flowering plants, and ch romoplastids in all plants except Fungi. Plastids vary in form from more or less spherical to polygonal or irregular -shaped bodies, and they increase in number by simple fission. They suffer decomposition much more readily than the nucleus, and are found i n dried material in a more or less altered condition. Leucoplastids. The chief function of the leucoplastids is that of building up reserve starches or those stored by the plant for food, and they may be best studied in the common potato tuber, rhizome o f iris, and the over ground tubers. The reserve starches are formed by the leucoplastids from sugar and other soluble carbohydrates. The chloroplastid occurs in all the green parts of plants. They vary from 3 to 11 /x in diameter and are more or less spher ical or lenticular in shape, except in the Algae, where they are large and in the shape of bands or disks, and generally spoken of as chromatophores. Chloroplastid are found in greater abundance in the cells near the upper surface of the leaf than upon the under surface, the proportion being about five to one. These grains upon close examination are found to consist of (1) a colourless stroma, or liquid, in which are embedded (2) green granules; (3) colourless granules; (4) protein masses; (5) starch grains ; and (6) a membrane which surrounds the whole. The green granules are looked upon as the CO 2 assimilation bodies, the colourless grains are supposed to assist in the storing of starch or in the production of diastase, the conditions for these processes be ing directly opposite, i.e., when CO 2 assimilation is active, starch is stored, and when this process is not going on. As at night, diastase is produced and the starch is dissolved. The protein grains may be in the nature of a reserve material of the plast id and are also probably formed as a result of CO 2 as simulation. While the protoplasm has been termed by Huxley \" The physical basis of life,\" the chloroplastid has been spoken of as the mill which supplies the world with its food, for it is by the proces s of photosynthesis that the energy of the sun is converted Knowlegde for Global Development 16 into vital energy, and starch and other products formed, which become not only the source of food for the plant itself, but also the source of the food -supply of the animals which feed upon plants . It other words, horse -power is derived from the energy of the sun which is stored by the chloroplastid in the plant. Chromoplastids. In many cases, as in roots, like those of carrot, or flowers and fruits, which are yellowish or orange colored, there i s present a corresponding yellow pigment, and to this class of pigments the name chlorophyll may be applied. Some of these pigments, as the carotin in carrot, have lien isolated in a crystalline condition Chromoplastids usually contain, as first pointed ou t by Schimper and Meyer, protein substances in the form of crystal -like bodies; starch -grains may also be present. The chromo plastids are variable in shape and in other ways are markedly different from the chloroplastid. They are more unstable than the ch loroplastid, and are formed in underground parts of the plant, as in roots, as well as in parts exposed to the light, as in the flower. Their formation frequently follows that of the chloroplastid, as in the ripening of certain yellow fruits, such as apple s, oranges, persimmons, etc. Chromo Plastids Plastid pigments They are distinguished from all other colour substances in the plant by the fact that they are insoluble in water and soluble in eth er, chloroform and similar solvents. In fact they are but little affected by the usual chemical reagents under ordinary conditions. Apart from the difference in colour, the yellow pigment (chlorophyll) is distinguished from the green (chlorophyll) by the f act that the latter is said to contain nitrogen, and also by their difference in behaviour when examined spectroscopically, chlorophyll giving several distinct bands in the yellow and orange portion of the spectrum, which arc wanting in the spectrum of the yellow principle. Non -protoplasmic cell -contents The non -protoplasmic constituents of plants may be said to differ from the protoplasmic cell -contents in two important particulars, namely, structure and function. Knowlegde for Global Development 17 For convenience in considering them here, they may be grouped as follows : (1) Those of definite form including (a) those which are colloidal or crystalloid, as starch and inulin; (b) those which are crystalline, as the sugars, alkaloids, glucosides, calcium oxalate (c) composite bodies, as aleur one grains, which are made up of a number of different substances. (2) Those of more or less indefinite form, including tannin, gums and mucilages, fixed and volatile oils, resins, gum -resins, oleo -resins, balsams, and also silica and calcium carbonate. Substances definite in form. Colloidal or crystalloid. Starch is the first visible product of photosynthesis although it is probable that simpler intermediate products are first formed. This substance is formed in the chloroplastid and is known as assimilat ion starch. Starch grains are usually found in the interior of the chloroplastid, but may attain such a size that they burst through the boundary wall of the plastid, which latter in the final stage of the growth of the starch grain forms a crescent -shaped disk attached to one end of grain, as in Pellionia. Starch is changed into soluble carbohydrates by the aid of ferments and probably other substances, and in this form is transported to those portions of the plant requiring food. The starch in the medulla ry rays and in other cells of the wood and bark of plants is distinguished by being in the form of rather small and nearly spherical grains. In rhizomes, tubers, bulbs and seeds the grains are, as a rule, quite large, and possess more or less distinct char acteristics for the plant in which they are found. Crystalline substances . The sugars constitute a group of crystalline principles of wide distribution. They occur in the cell -sap, from which by evaporation or on treatment with alcohol they may be crysta llized out. Quite a large number of distinct principles belonging to this class have been recognized, of which the following may be mentioned Dextrose (grape -sugar or dextro -glucose) is found in sweet fruits, the nectarines of the flowers, and stems and leaves of various plants. It crystallizes in needles and varies in amount from i to 2 per cent, (in peaches), to 30 per cent Sucrose (saccharine or cane -sugar) is found rather widely distributed, as in the stems of corn, sorghum and the sugar -cane ; in r oots, as the sugar -beet ; in the sap of certain trees, as sugarmaple and some of the palms Maltose It is found in the germinating grains of cereals (see malt); it forms colourless, needle - shaped crystals resembling those of dextrose, and forms compounds with calcium, strontium, barium and acetic acid. Knowlegde for Global Development 18 Cell -sap The majority of the other colour -substances found in the higher plants besides the green and yellow principles previously mentioned occur in solution in the cell -sap, and may be in the nature of secondary substances derived from the plastid pigments, or they may be produced directly by the protoplasm. Upon making sections of the tissues containing cell sap colour substances, not infrequently strikingly contrasting colours are observed in contiguou s cells; as in the petals of the poppy and petals of certain lilies, where we find some cells of a deep purple colour, others of a deep red and still others of intermediate shades. Calcium oxalate is found in many of the higher plants, and in the algs and fungi as well; while in the mosses, ferns, grasses and sedges it is seldom found. It occurs in plants in crystals of either the monoclinic or tetragonal system. The crystals dissolve in any of the mineral acids without effervescence and their identity is u sually confirmed by the use of dilute hydrochloric acid. The crystals of the monoclinic system are rather widely distributed, while those of the tetragonal system are less frequent in their occurrence, being found in species of Allium, crystals belonging t o the monoclinic system include a number of forms, as follows: (1) Rosette aggregates, or what are commonly termed rosette -shaped crystals; (2) prisms, pyramids and elongated crystals (3) crystal -fibers (4) raphides; (5) sphen oid micro - crystals. Rosette aggregates of calcium oxalate It consists of numerous small prisms and pyramids, or hemihedral crystals more or less regularly arranged around a central axis, have the appearance of a rosette or star. The development of these aggregates may is readily observed in the stem of Datura. Crystals of this class are more widely distributed than any of the others, and are found in a number of drugs. Monoclinic prisms and pyramids are also widely distributed and are frequently so in fo rm that they are of an elongated or irregular polygonal shape. The crystals of this group are sometimes mistaken for silica, owing to the fact that in some instances the lumen of the cell is completely filled by the crystal, and the inner wall having the c ontour of the crystal, it is impossible to determine whether the crystal is affected by the use of hydrochloric acid. It should be stated in this connection that silica never occurs as a cell -content in sharp, angular crystals, but either in more or less ellipsoidal or irregular hollow masses, or in somewhat solid, irregularly branching masses. Crystal Fibers . In quite a number of drugs a single monoclinic prism occurs in each of the parenchyma cells adjoining the sclerenchymatous fibers, and to this sing le longitudinal row of superimposed cells the name crystal fiber has been applied Knowlegde for Global Development 19 Raphides Raphides are groups of needle -shaped crystals which are found in various plants .These have been mistaken by several observers for calcium phosphate. Calcium phosp hate, however, occurs in plants either in solution or in combination with protein substance. The cells containing raphides are long, thin -walled and contain sooner or later a mucilage, which arises from the cell -sap and behaves with reagents much like cher ry gum. Amorphous substances Cystoliths . Occasionally cells are found among the parenchyma or in the inner row of the epidermal cells on the upper side of the leaf, the walls of which form an inward protrusion in cell and impregnated with and encrusted b y calcium Carl ovate, giving rise to more or less stalked bodies known as Cystoliths The calcium carbonate Calcium carbonate dissolves on the application of acetic acid, leaving a core which responds to the tests for cellulose. Cystoliths are not of comm on occurrence, being found with but few exceptions in the two families Acanthaceae and Moraceae, and in a few species of the Cucurbitacese. In the leaves of the cultivated ruber plant the Cystoliths have long stalks, whereas in cannabis indica, they are se ssile. Tannin and Tannoids Tannins are astringent principles which belong to the class of phenol acids and give blue or green precipitates with iron salts. The Tannoids, in addition, precipitate aluminous compounds, and when applied to animal hides conve rt them into leather. These principles are widely distributed, occurring dissolved in the cell -sap, in parenchyma cells or in distinct reservoirs or vessels, and vary in amount from T per cent, or less to as high as 70 per cent, in Chinese galls. Tannin ma y be precipitated in the plant cells by copper acetate. Mucilages and Gums By the terms mucilages and gums are meant those substances which are soluble in water, or swell very perceptibly in it, and which, upon the addition of alcohol, are precipitated in the form of a more or less amorphous or granular mass.

ABSTRACT The textile materials were considered primarily for economic and functional point of view some end users in particular demands on the safety of textiles for the health. An insect -repellent helped to pr event and control the outbreak of insect -home disease such as malaria, dengue fever. The most herbal plants contain compounds that are preventing attack from phytophagous regulators. Insect repellent textiles are also a part of protective textiles which he lp in protection from the species that are prone to cause damage in some or the other manner. These textile products find their application over a wide range. The knitted fabrics were finished with mosquito repellent test by excite chamber. The treated fabrics show 100% mosquito repellent efficiency. The finished fabrics were tested for laundering process they retained their activity until 16 washes. So these types of plant based mosquito repellents has been used for generations in practice as a personal pr otection against mosquito. KEYWORDS : Eco -friendly fabrics, herbal plants, laundering properties . INTRODUCTION Protective textiles are among one such smart application of smart technology in textiles. Protective textiles refer to those textile products w hich have a functionality of giving protection from something in some or the other sense. Mosquitoes have a complex method of detecting hosts and different types of mosquitoes react to different stimuli. At present, there are very few durable repellents th at can be applied to clothing and almost all the repellents are designed to be applied directly on the skin. This poses a great risk to the individuals using them and hence, with a view to reducing this risk and at the same time meeting the needs of indust ry. Basically mosquito repelling textiles are the ones which have a character of repelling mosquitoes. This feature was developed as a need in sense of protection from the mosquitoes in the areas which are habitats of the mosquitoes and are prone to diseas e like malaria. Global warming has resulted in the spread of mosquitoes from tropical regions to rest of the world resulting in spread of viral infection to different parts of the world. Anti - mosquito finishing on textile products can suppress mosquito -transmitted diseases such as West Nile fever; malaria. Knowlegde for Global Development 22 Herbs are available in a variety of forms, including fresh, dried, in tablets or capsules, or bottled in liquid form. Buy them individually or in mixtures formulated for specific conditions. Finishing is the general term for a multitude of processes and treatments which a fabric may undergo after it has been knitted. Finishes are also categorized by their degree of performance. Cotton is the natural vegetable fiber of great economic importance as a raw m aterial for cloth. Bamboo is grown using methods and materials that have low impact on the environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fabric selection The fabric used as the textile substrates in the present research work was 50s combed bamboo/cotton blended kni tted fabrics. Pretreatment The material is treated with soap at 50 0C for 20 minutes to remove the dirt on the untreated fabric with water. The soap solution is added into water in the proportion of 3: 1.Then the material is given hot wash and cold wash. The M: L is 1:30. Selection of the Medicinal Valuable Herbs The herbal plant were identified and collected from the natural resources in a pure form. The following plant was chosen for the study Rosemary . The procedure begins with the selection of natural herb, which was screened and identified. The extract was tested for its Mosquito Repellent which was done by Excito chamber method. Rosemary has been around for a long time, and therefore has a long list of claims regarding its medicinal uses, including use as a tonic, a digestive aid, to treat depression, headache, and muscle spam, and as an expectorant, promoter of menstrual flow, and stimulant for production of bile. Extraction of Rosemary leaves Methanol Extraction For extraction, 6g of dry powder f rom each herb ( Rosemary ) was taken and mixed into 50ml of 80% Methanol. The container was closed and kept for over night. After over night incubation, the extract was filtered through filter paper and evaporated to concentrate the extract. The extract was finished on the fabric by dip dry method and tested for its mosquito repellency activity. Knowlegde for Global Development 23 Collection of mosquitoes Anopheles mosquitoes were identified based on morphologic keys and they were collected during the evening time. All the mosquitoes were starved of blood and sugar for 4 hours. Mosq uito Repellency Behavioral Test Specially designed two excito repellency test chambers were used to evaluate the efficiency of repellency activity. The wooden outer chamber of excito -repellency testing device me asures 34 cm \u00d7 32 cm \u00d7 32 cm and faces the front panel with the single escape portal. The box is composed of a rear door cover, an inner Plexiglas glass panel with a rubber latex -sealed door, a Plexiglas holding frame, a screened inner chamber, an outer chamber, a front door, and an exit portal slot. Mosquitoes were deprived of all nutrition and water for a minimum of 4 hours before exposure. Laboratory tests were performed during daylight hours only and each test was replicated four times. Observations wer e taken at one -minute interval for 30 minutes. After each test was completed, the number of Escaped specimens and those remaining inside the chamber was recorded separately for each exposure chamber, external holding cage, and paired control chamber. Escap ed specimens and those remaining inside the chamber, for the treated samples, were held separately in small holding containers with food and water. The repellency were calculated by below formula: Fig-1 shows the Excito chamber Knowlegde for Global Development 24 Wash durability test The rosemary extract finished samples was then subjected for 16 machine washes and the washed fabric was tested for its mosquito repellency efficiency using excite chamber method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The results shows that the mosquito repellent activity was the highest with Rosemary extract finished samples. The mosquito repellent activity for the fabrics was determined by examining the mortality rates of the mosquitoes after exposure to the leaf extracts.

Box 2500, Eldoret -30100, Kenya. ABSTRACT Ethnobotanical medicine has attracted great interest due to the belief that it is safe, cheap and more dependable than aliphatic drugs, which have adverse side effects. The current study was conducted to analyze the antibacterial activity of Tetradenia riparia leaves hydroalcoholic e xtract. The plant sample was extracted using methanol and water in the ratio of 9:1. From the study the plant Tetradenia riparia was found to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli with a zone of inhibition of data collected and documented in this paper is a scientific justification that the plant Tetradenia riparia can be used to treat against various diseases caused by Escherichia coli, Serratia liquefaciens, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus vulgaris. However, further research is needed to isolate the active compounds identify their structure, their mode of acti on to the microorganisms and their effect in the in vivo environment. KEYWORDS : Tetradenia riparia, Antibacterial, Medicinal herbs, Leaves. INTRODUCTION Nature is a paradise of medicinal solutions to all ailments affecting human beings through medicinal plants. Medicinal plants are being used widely to treat against the currently widespread strains of drug resistant bacteria. Scientists all over the world are working hard to provide scientific justification on the traditional use of medicinal plants to treat against the ailments affecting human beings Pharmacological studies have reported appealing results showing the importance of using plant extract to treat diseases. The reports have shown that plants can be used as antitumor, anti -inflammatory, antib acterial activity, anti -hyperlipidemic, (Kaoli and Kauli , 2011) . The antibacterial activity of plants has been associated with the presence of certain compounds referred Knowlegde for Global Development 28 to as phytochemicals such as Nyaberi et al., 2008) . All chemicals found in plants are potential drugs. Certain tree barks produce chemicals that discourage caterpillars from feeding on them , a good example bei ng the Indian neem tree, which keeps off desert locusts. The twigs are chewed by people in Serengeti national park in east Africa to prevent tooth decay. Plants produce more than 10,000 different compounds to prevent themselves against animals who feed on them. Almost half of all prescribed drugs contain chemicals produced by plants, fungi and bacteria. Aliphatic drugs also contain synthesized compounds in the laboratory that have been modeled after plants originating compounds (Moore et al., 1995) . The u se of medicinal plants to treat diseases is as old as man. Medicinal plants have been used since ancient times to treat many illnesses (Mir et al., 2013) . Research has shown that the concentration of these compounds in plants is directly related to their capability to treat certain illness. Many of these non -nutritive secondary metabolites are found in plants which are even used for food. Over 80% of the plants in Nigeria used for treatment of malaria and other sicknesses are also used as food (Cousins and Huffman , 2002) ; there seem to be not much distinction between medicinal benefits of plants and their nutritive value. Over the past few years much research has been done and is still going on to prove scientifically the plants nutritional value and medic inal value. A good number of chemical compounds have been discovered from plants and found to have pharmacological value; this has led to the development of over 25% of all the artificial medicines used today. Many of the traditional plants species used al l over the world have been found to have great pharmacological value. Studies carried out throughout Africa confirm that indigenous plants are the main constituents of traditional medicines. The published WHO traditional strategy addressed the issues and p rovided a framework for countries to develop policies to govern medicinal plants use. The strategy put forward by WHO advocates the formulation of a policy by states as the first component of developing traditional medicine. India is one of the few countr ies which have started to develop such policies (Prajapati and Purohit , 2003) . Over 80% of the people in developing countries use medicinal plants to treat the illnesses which affect them from time to time (Ganga et al., 2012) . This can be attributed to poverty in these countries which has led to inefficient health care system in hospitals and inadequate resources to access these facilities. People in these countries look for cheap and available medicines which are known traditionally to cure the illnesse s. The use of herbal medicines in the western world is steadily growing with 40% of the population using plants to treat illnesses; while in Kenya 90% of the population has one Knowlegde for Global Development 29 time in their life used medicinal plants (Adongo et al., 2012) . The use of thes e plants in treatment of ailments is mainly based on the type of flora in that region. Our environment is very rich with a great range of medicinal plants and this mainly explains the reason why our grands lived for quite some time. They could stay in t he bush during war and even could use plants to treat ailments and wounds affecting soldiers in the battle ground. People all over the world should go back to these basics of treatment. Many communities in Africa still consider the use of medicinal plants as an important part of their culture, just to mention, the Maasai community in Kenya still value their culture very much, the Kalenjn community and their medicinal fermented milk which is prepared mainly from medicinal plants such as Senna didymobotrya stem which previous studies have shown this plant to have a great potential in treatment of diseases such as typhoid, diarrhea and food poisoning caused by Salmonella typhi, E.coli and Bacillus cereus (Ngule et al., 2013) . The reason why herbal medicine st ill remains controversial is because of some greedy practitioners who want to become wealthy by pretending to know much about the treatment of every disease that clients complain about. This has led to administration of wrong drugs which do not cure a pat ient leading to death of the individual. Proper scientific evidence needs to be provided in order to create confidence in medicinal herbs. The increase of multi -resistant strains of bacteria calls for new discoveries of new classes of antibiotics that can clearly inhibit these resistant strains. This is the reason why much research should be turned to plants which have been used since ancient times to treat many diseases (Cousins and Huffman , 2002) . The non -nutritive plant components are referred to as p hytochemicals, which can be divided in two major categories primary and secondary, with the primary constituting of carbohydrates, proteins and chlorophyll and the secondary consisting of tannins, alkaloids, saponins, steroids, flavonoids, terpenoids and al., 2013) . The secondary metabolites help the plant survive in the environment by protecting them against predators but research has shown that these metabolites can be used to treat diseases in both animals and humans (Kokwaro , 2009). The antibacterial activity of plants has been closely associated with the presence of these important compounds in the plant. Plants antibacterial activity against various bacteria such as B.cereus, Klebsiella sp ., Streptococcus pyogenes and Proteus vulgaris has been closely associated to the presence of phytochemicals in the plants (Swamy et al., 2013) . Physiological activities of phytochemicals have been found to include cancer prevention, antibacterial, antifungal, anti -oxidative, hormone action an d enzyme stimulation. Natural bioactive compounds have been investigated in plants and their pharmacological effects analyzed. Secondary metabolites functions on growth, Knowlegde for Global Development 30 photosynthesis and other important plant activities have not been discovered but thei r medicinal values have been identified in most of them (Ghasemzadeh and Ghasemzadeh , 2011) . Phytochemicals have been used to a greater extend in Asia for various purposes such as treatment of diseases (Bodeker , 2000) . The lack of scientific knowledge on the phytochemical constituents, antibacterial, antioxidants and toxicological properties limits the use of traditional herbal medicine (Nyaberi et al., 2008) . Phytochemicals can really improve the activity of the currently used drugs by acting as efflux of existing pump inhibitors. Many drug resistant microbes are emerging from time to time and causing the need to such for new antibiotics to kill and inhibit their growth. Phytochemicals have been associated with reduction of drug resistant forms of bacteria (Stauri et al., 2007) . A big percentage of plants in the savanna and semi -arid areas of east Africa where Kenya is located contains alkaloids which have been associated with increase in renal secretion when ingested, hence used as a diuretics and in the treatment of dropsy (Kokwaro , 2009) . The use of alkaloids, saponins and tannins as antibiotics has been scientifically justified (Mir et al., 2013) . Majority of the pharmacologically active chemical compounds were found mainly in ethanol extracts which is contrary to previous researches which had affirmed the traditional way of extracting these compounds using water (Iqbal , 2012) . According to Coopoosamy and Naidoo (2011) , the plant Tetradenia riparia has great effect in the treatment against skin infectio ns. The plant has also shown great potency in the treatment of chest diseases. According to Ndamane et al ., (2013) , the plant showed antibacterial activity against all the gram positive and gram negative bacteria it was tested against. In Kenya, the plant has a wide variety of uses depending on the region. The plant is used traditionally in the rift valley and western region to treat against stomach problems, wound infections, throat infections and also it is believed to treat have anti -cancer activity. The plant is grown by the local Nandi community in Kenya along farm edges and around their homes. The plant is greatly used by traditional practioners to treat various diseases; however, some of the practioners find it difficult to transfer this information t o their clients even upon request for the information about the plant. This calls for scientific documentation to enable the transfer of knowledge about the plants use. The literature available is also contradicting and therefore the current study was not only done to give a scientific justification of the plants traditional use but also to compare the data obtained in this study with that in literature and provide a scientific view on the same. Knowlegde for Global Development 31 MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Collection and Preparation The herb was randomly collected in the natural forest around University of Eastern Africa, Baraton. The plant samples were collected and identified by a taxonomist in the University of Eastern Africa, Baraton. The samples were thoroughly mixed and spread to dry at room temperature in the chemistry laboratory for about three weeks. They were then ground into fine powder and put in transparent polythene bags. Extraction procedure Using electric analytical beam balance fifty grams of the powdered leaves of the Tetradenia riparia was placed in 1000 ml conical flask, methanol and water were then added in the ratio of 9:1 respectively until the leaves were completely submerged in the solvent. The mixture was then agitated for thorough mixing. The mixture was kept for 24 hours on a shaker for effective extraction of the plant components. The extract was filtered using Butchner funnel; Whatman no.1 filter paper and a vacuum and pressure pump. The filtrate was re -filtered again using the same apparatus. The solvent wa s evaporated using rotary vacuum evaporator (R -11) with a water bath at 40oC. The extract was brought to dryness using vacuum and pressure pump at room temperature. The residue was then obtained and used for the experiment. BIOASSAY STUDY Preparation of t he Bacterial Suspension: The turbidity of each of the bacterial suspension was prepared to match to a 0.5 McFarland standard, a procedure similar to that used by Biruhalem et al., (2011) and Donay et al., (2007) . The McFarland standard was prepared by dis solving 0.5 g of BaCl 2 in 50 ml of water to obtain a 1% solution of Barium chloride (w/v). This was mixed with 99.5 ml of 1% sulphuric acid solution. Three - five identical colonies of each bacterium was taken from a blood agar plate (Himedia) culture and dropped in Mueller Hinton broth (Himedia). The broth culture was incubated at 370C for 2 - 6 hours until it achieved turbidity similar to the 0.5 McFarland standards. The culture that exceeded the 0.5 McFarland standard were each adjusted with the aid o f a UV spectrophotometer to 0.132A0 at a wavelength of 600 nm in order to obtain an approximate cell density of 1x108 CFU/ml. Preparation of the Extract Concentrations and Antibiotic: Stock solutions for the extracts were prepared by dissolving 500 mg in 1 ml of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). An antibiotic control was made by dissolving 500 mg of Penicillin in 1 ml of sterile distilled water. DMSO served as a negative control. Determination of bioactivity of the Extract: Mueller Hinton agar plates were pr epared by the manufacturers instruction. The media was sterilized in an autoclave at 1210C for 15 minutes. The plates were also sterilized at Knowlegde for Global Development 32 the same temperature. The media was then poured on to the plates and air bubbles removed from the surface of the plates using non luminous Bunsen burner flame. The bacterial suspension was smeared on the surface of the plates using a sterile swab. Five wells were then drilled in each agar plate. Three of the wells were filled with the plant extract. The other wells were filled with penicillin and DMSO control respectively. Three plates were made for each bacterial organism and extract giving a triplicate reading for each microorganism and extract. The wells were labeled on the underside of the plate and incubated a t 370C for between 24 to 48 hours and the zones of inhibition were measured in millimeters with the aid of a ruler. RESULTS AND DISCUSION Table 1: Zones of Inhibition (mean \u00b1 S.E.) of 500 mg/ml of Tetradenia ms. inhibition (\u00b1S.E.) was calculated for each of the microbial organism. The zones of inhibition of the microorganisms were also analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and it was shown that there were significant differences in the zones of inhibition among the microbial organisms (p<0.05). The biggest z one of inhibition was against B. cereus (28.00\u00b11.154) used as the positive control inhib ited the growth of all the organisms while DMSO did not have any inhibition against the organisms tested. Knowlegde for Global Development 33 Table 2: Tu rkey's Honestly Significant Difference among Microorganisms. (Using 500mg/ml of Tetradenia riparia Extract) Comparison P Value Significance E. coli vs Salmonella typhi 0.001 S E. coli vs S. liquifaciens 0.995 NS E. coli vs E. aerogenes 0.084 NS E. coli vs Bacillus cereus 0.000 S E. coli vs Proteus typhi 0.000 typhi vs 0.001 liquefaciens vs 0.036 liquefaciens vs 0.000 liquefaciens vs 0.953 aerogenes vs 0.000 aerogenes vs 0.145 NS B. cereus vs P. vulgaris 0.000 S The study shows that the plant Tetradenia riparia can inhibit the growth of five microorganisms out of the six it was tested against. The plant show clear zones of inhibition against Escherichia coli with a zone inhibitio n of 500 mg/ml of Tetradenia riparia showed that there was significant difference in the zones of inhibition among the organisms (p<0.001). Further comparison using the Tukeys pairwise comparison showed that the zones of inhibition for E. coli were signif icantly higher than those of Salmonella sp. and P. vulgaris (p<0.05). Zones of inhibition of Salmonella typhi were significantly lower than all of the other organisms (p<0.05) except for E. aerogenes . Significant difference were also observed between B. cereus and all the organisms (p<0.05). The study is in conformity with previous studies in which the plants methanol and water extracts were found to inhibit the growth of all the gram positive and gram negative bacteria (Ndamane et al., 2013) , The study is completely in agreement with the same study in which the plant inhibited B. cereus most. The current study use a system of solvent which constituted methanol and water in the ratio of 9:1 unlike in previous studies the two were used separately. The data obtained in this study in conformity with previous studies which shows the two solvents to have great antibacterial activity, however, contradicts with the results obtained by Erasto et al., Knowlegde for Global Development 34 (2005) , the plant did not show antibacterial activity against E. coli and B. cereus . The antibacterial activity of the plant can be attributed to the presence of the phytochemicals. The phytochemicals found in the plant have been investigated and found to have antibacterial activity therefore justifying traditional pla nt use to treat against various diseases caused by bacteria (Gazim et al., 2010) . The plant extract can be used to treat infections caused by Bacillus cereus viz posttraumatic wounds, self -limited gastroenteritis, burns, surgical wounds and ocular infections such as endophthalmitis, corne al abscess and panophthalmitis -Arribas & Sankararaman and Velayuthan , 2013) . The plant extract can also be used to treat immunologically compromised patients including AIDS and malignant disease victims (Cotton et al., 1987 & Tuazon et al. 1979) . The plants ability to inhibit the growth of E. coli is a scientific justification that the plant can be used to treat against enteric infections caused by the bacteria. The plants extract can al so be used to treat against gastro -intestinal diseases, ear infections, urinary tract infections and wounds infections caused by Proteus vulgaris (Goodwin et al., 1971 & Neter and Farrar , 1943) . Indigofera arrecta can be a good source of active compounds for a variety of diseases affecting human beings in the world today. The plants ability to inhibit the growth of Serratia liquefaciens shows how the plant can be important to treat against the bacteria which according to Okunda et al., (1984) cause nosoco mial urinary tract infections. The inhibition of the plant against these bacteria is, therefore, note worthy since the microorganisms have been found to have resistance against most of the currently used antibiotics. Enterobacter aerogenes is a major caus e of a wide variety of nosocomial infections viz, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, meningitis, wound infections and intravascular and prosthetic devices infections ( Santos et al., 1990, Blot et al., 2003, Donnenberg , 2005) . CONCLUSION The data provide d in this study is a scientific justification that the plant Tetradenia riparia can be used to treat against diseases such as abdominal cramps and diarrhea caused by Bacillus cereus due to its ability to cause food poisoning, treat against Escherichia coli which causes serious and even life threatening effects such as hemolytic - uremic syndrome (HUS), diarrhea and neonatal meningitis. It can also be used to treat against throat problems caused by Serratia liquefaciens , opportunist pathogen Proteus vulgaris which causes wound infections. From the study the plant Tetradenia riparia has shown to have great medicinal value and therefore justifying its traditional use to treat against various diseases. More research needs to be done to identify the mode of action of the active compounds in the plant.

Similipal Biosphere Reserve is present at the center of Mayurbhanj District; its rich biodiversity is acknowledged internationally. The district as a whole and SBR in particular, offers unique opportunities to study the indigenous knowledge and their uses prevalent among the local tribes. The native tribals depend on wild as well as cultivated plants for their various food and medicinal purposes. As a part of the socio -cultural life, all tribes prepare rice beverage using their own unique starter culture. In the preparation of starter they use some of the wild plants as antimicrobials without knowing the actual role of these plants in fermentation. They say that yeast is formed from these plants, responsible for yeast acti on during the fermentation. This chapter deals with the available plants used for starter preparation of Handia by the tribes of Mayubhanj, their ethnomedicinal uses. All these plants were evaluated for the phytochemical constituents and antibacterial acti vity against enteric pathogens. Results found that alcoholic extracts of the plants contain abundant alkaloids, flavonoids, carbohydrate, protein and amino acids, saponins, tannin and phenolic compounds. With the exception all test plant parts exhibited antibacterial activity by agar cup method. The zone of inhibition was found maximum against Staphylococcus aureus followed by Shigella sonn ei and S. flexneri. The MIC result ranged from 125 to 1000 \u00b5g/ml (w/v) with the lowest against S. aureus (125, 156, 250 \u00b5g/ml) followed by S. sonnei (156, 250, 312, 500, 625 \u00b5g/ml). MBC test validate that in between 1000 -2500 \u00b5g/ml (w/v) concentrations, mo st of test bacteria were killed due to broad spectrum activity. This chapter also provides information on different types of starter used for preparation of rice beverage through out India. KEYWORDS : Bakhar, Alcoholic beverage, Traditional knowledge, Pro cess technology, Ethnomedicine, Enteric pathogens Knowlegde for Global Development 40 INTRODUCTION A wide range of cereal based fermented foods exist throughout the Asian and African countries. Since rice is the major cereal in these areas, a global interest in rice and its fermented produ ct is increasing due to their caloric value, unique quality characteristics and high acceptability (Steinkraus, 1994). In most of the countries, rice is fermented either by using mixed culture(s) into alcoholic beverages, or by natural fermentation into le avened batter formed dough breads which are usually baked or steamed (Yokotsuka, 1991). Rice beer is an integral part of life of several aboriginal communities throughout the world. In India, from time immemorial, both fermented and distilled beverages ha ve been prepared by fermenting different varieties of rice. These beverages are primarily prepared and used by different tribal communities of the northern and eastern part of India. In Odisha, from time immemorial, both fermented and distilled beverages have been prepared by fermenting different varieties of rice. These beverages are primarily prepared and used by different tribal communities all over the state. About 62 ethnic tribal communities are reported from the state (Naik, 1998) and they mostly i nhabit forest villages. They meet most of their requirements, including food and primary healthcare, from the forest resources. Out of 62, 30 communities (48%), several aboriginals, are found in the district of Mayurbhanj, (largest district of the state; a rea - 10, 418 sq km forest cover - 4, 392 sq km. population - 25, 13, 895/2011 census). Similipal Biosphere Reserve (SBR, 5569 sq. km.) is located at the centre of the district and its rich biodiversity is acknowledged internationally. The district as a wh ole and SBR in particular, offers unique opportunities to study the indigenous knowledge and their uses prevalent among the local tribes. Santal, Kolha, Bathudi, Bhumij, Lodha, Kisan and Baiga are minor tri bal groups that inhabit the area. Santals constitute the largest tribal group of the district and are scattered throughout. The social, cultural and religious life of aboriginal people is influenced by the nature and natural resources available in and arou nd their habitat that provide food, fodder, medicine, shelter and various other material and cultural needs. The fermented food, locally known as handia , is an inseparable food item in the life of tribals of Mayurbhanj and most other districts of the stat e. The word handia finds its origin from the word Handi in Odia (local language), means large earthen pot. Handia occupies a key position in the social, cultural and economic life of Santals and accepted as a traditional drink (Sahu, 1996). Handia is gener ally prepared throughout the year, but most common during the summer months (March to June). Women and children are also fond of these beverages but consume in small quantity and preferably during festivals, ceremonies and on Sundays. Tribals get 5 -10% of their daily nutrient requirements that plays a supplementary role in the nutrition of the people (Roy, 1978). Knowlegde for Global Development 41 It is prepared from rice along with some of the locally available plant parts through some indigenous method. Otherwise known as country liquor o r poor mans whiskey, it is relished by one and all and in most occasions. T he process of starter (locally known as Bakhara/Ranu) preparation of each tribe is almost similar with slight differences. The main ingredients of starter preparation are rice alon g with some of the locally available plant parts through some indigenous method. So, a survey of the use of medicinal plants in preparation of Bakhara/Ranu by the tribes in the District Mayurbhanj was carried out. The tribals do not know the authentic role of these plants in the fermentation. According their knowledge, either yeast is formed from these plants or these plants are responsible for the yeasts action in fermentation. The present paper deals with the description and ethnomedicinal uses of plants for the starter preparation by the tribes of Odisha. For scientific validation all these plants were subjected for screened of antimicrobial activity and phytochemical screening. LITERATURE REVIEW Traditional rice -based alcoholic beverages Traditional r ice beverages have different compositions according to the formulation and processes used. The principle of their manufacture can be characterized as a biochemical modification of cereal starches brought about by microorganisms. Moulds produce the amylases that degrade the starch into dextrins and sugars and yeasts convert these sugars to alcohol (Lim, 1991; Motarjemi and Nout, 1996; Nout and Aidoo 2002). The preparation and the use of fermentation starters as a source of inoculum are important for prepar ation of rice beverage. The choice of starter tablets influences the yield and quality of the rice beer. Even in certain region the local processors claim that using a combination of two or three different starters yields better quality with a stronger swe et alcoholic taste and more attractive flavor than is obtained with a single starter. The dried starters normally include yeasts, moulds and bacteria and convert starchy materials to fermentable sugars and subsequently to alcohol and organic acids (Hesselt ine et al., Nout and Aidoo, 2002). A variety of starter cultures is available in the through out India especially in the North East region (Table -1).

Also mixed flours are preferred in certain region. These mixtures are ground and thoroughly mixed with spices and herbs that are believed to play a role in preventing the growth of undesirable microorganisms. The spices and herbs used include mi xtures of garlic, pepper, onion, rhizomes and root of oriental herbs and producers jealously guard their own secret recipes. The ratio of ground rice to mixed spices is different about 14:1 by weight. Water is added to form a dough -like mass with moisture content of 55 -60% which is inoculated with dry powdered starter from previous batches, followed by thorough mixing. The inoculated dough is shaped into small flattened or ball -shaped cakes about 4 cm in diameter and 1cm thick. The cakes are placed on a bam boo tray and are then covered with a thin layer of rice husks. According to producers this reduces overheating and facilitates aeration. The tray is covered with a cloth and incubated in a ventilated place at ambient temperature (approx. 28 -32\u00b0C) for 2 -5 days during which time the dough rises slightly and becomes covered with fungal mycelium. The cakes are air or sun -dried and then have a shelf life of several months. Throughout the world three different kinds of starters are used e.g. starters without oriental medicinal herbs; starters supplemented with oriental medicinal herbs; and starters supplemented with plant containing aromatic essential oils. In the most cases, starters supplemented with medicinal plants are predominating. It was suggested by some authors that a number of plants have a stimulatory effect on biomass and on yeast count. Few authors believe that plants are used in starter because of their antibacterial properties and their fragrant flavour. Knowlegde for Global Development 46 Preparation of Angkur by the Bodos tribe s of Assam (Das et al., 2012) Jou Bishi is the local rice beer prepared by the Bodos using the starter cakes known as angkur . For preparing angkur , different plant materials are said to be used based on their availability in different regions. The most com mon species are leaves of Xanthium strumarium , Scoparia dulcis and either roots or leaves of Clerodendrum viscosum . These plants are first washed properly and allowed to dry in the air. Rice grains are soaked for about 5 hours in normal temperature water a nd allowed to soften. This is then mixed with the plants and grinded together in a wooden mortar with a pestle and this set of apparatus is called wayal . Dough is made by adding a little water to the mixture. They are then made into round cakes with differ ent size and covered with powder of the mixture to which water is not added. This is followed by covering with gigab (paddy straw) and allowed to dry for a period of 3 -4 days. These can be stored in moisture free places for more than a year. Preparation o f Apop Pitha by the Mising tribes of Upper Assam (Gogoi et al., 2013) For preparing apop pitha a mixture of plants (table) collected, cleaned and dried by placing on a bamboo mat. Soaked rice and the leaves are grinded separately in a wooden grinder and th ey are mixed together in a vessel with a little of water. From the dough, oval shaped balls of about (6 cm x3cm) are made and dried in the sun. Apop pitha is used for preparation of Apong -rice beer. The earthen pot is use as a fermentor and before starting the fermentation process, it is fumigated by placing it on a bamboo frame constructed over the fire place until the pot turns blackish. There after the boiled rice are spread over a large banana leaf and allowed to cool. To this powdered apop pitha is add ed (1 apop pitha for 1 kg of rice) and the whole mixture is kept inside the fermentor and the mouth of the pot is covered with banana leaves or leaves of bhilongoni (Cyclosorus exlensa ). The fermentor is left for a period of at least 5 days. A little water is added to the fermented product and is filtered to get the apong (Das et al., 2012) . Similar type of starter is also prepared by the Khampti tribe of Arunachal Pradesh locally known as Khamtip for preparation of et al., 2012). and Sharma, Rice -beer cake is popularly known as bakhor, surachi or phap among the Rabhas of Goalpara district while rice -beer is known as choko or jongamod. Paste of 2 kg wet seeds of ric e (Oryza sativa L.) is prepared after mixing several plants. A considerable amount of old rice -beer cake is mixed along with these plant materials for the preparation of fresh rice -beer cakes. Some round and flat globules (each of around 50 gm) are prepare d from the grinded mixture. The globules are placed on straw. Different parts of ten plant species are used in particular amount to prepare rice -beer cake. Heteropogon contortus is kept scattered on a broad sieve made of bamboo ( Bambusa Knowlegde for Global Development 47 vulgaris ) and then sun dried. To prepare rice -beer choko or phap, tightly cooked fresh rice (using less amount of water) is used. After cooking, Rabhas scatter rice on a broad mat made of bamboo and cooled. Then a particular amount of rice beer cake (generally 2 pieces for b oiled rice prepared from 2 kg of fresh rice) is powdered and mixed with the cooked rice. A special type of cylinder made of bamboo net, known among Rabhas as janthi, is placed inside an earthen pitcher, known as jonga. Now, already prepared mixture of rice and rice -beer cake is kept inside jonga and outside janthi. At last, open mouth of jonga is tightly sealed with banana ( Musa balbisiana ) leaf warmed in fire and placed in a dark place. Rabhas place Ricinus communis L. leaf and one piece of wood charcoal o ver the lid of jonga made of banana leaf ward off the effect of evil sprit. During summer, (after 4 -5 days) and during winter (after 7 -8 days), choko or rice -beer attains the actual stage for drinking. A hole is made at the venter of dried shell of matured fruit of Lagenaria siceraria Standl. and used to collect the local alcoholic drink stored inside janthi placed inside jonga. The rice -beer prepared through the above process of fermentation is again fermented adding particular amount of water and rice - beer cake. After 3 -4 days, rice beer is collected and distilled through a local process using 3 earthen or metalic pitcher -like pots (hadi / luduki), placing one over another; 2nd and 3rd pots having a hole at the bottom. The whole equipment is made air -tight using jute ( Corchorus capsularis L.) fibre and mud at the junctions. The resulting drink is strong liquor, known as fotika and Rabhas believe that it has curative effect on psychiatric patients. Preparation of epop (starter culture) by Mishing tribe of A ssam (Kardong et al., 2012) The epop is prepared from rice, preferably glutinous, soaked in water for about 2 hrs., ground together and mixed properly with semidried powder of leaves or the whole plant/plant parts which is then kneaded to specific shape (u sually oval) followed by the transfer (inoculation) of microbial consortium with desired quality from the old stock of previous batch culture. The preparation of epop and the poro apong is somewhat similar with babud preparation reported from Phillipines a nd the Ipoh preparation by Adi tribe of Arunachal Pradesh, India (Tiwari and Mohanta, 2007). Mishing tribe generally uses at least 16 different herbs with different interpretations (Table -1). This number may vary from place to place, persons to persons wit hin the tribe itself. Preparation of Hamei as a starter by Meitei tribes, Manipur (Singh and Singh, 2006) Yu is a distilled product of the fermented local rice of Meitei communities of Manipur. For quality and more alcohol production of Yu, Hamei (a ferm ented product) is added generally, because of its action as a starter/catalyst. Moreover, the preparation of Hamei is a popular domestic business for the people of scheduled caste and tribes, as it is also used as an ingredient of cattle foods. The traditi onal practitioners believe that, the quality of Hamei fermentation will be responsible for the quality and quantity of ethyl alcohol. Knowlegde for Global Development 48 Sekmai, similar ingre dients and methods except with the slight differences in shape, size and coverings during the process of fermentation. White rice of about 3 kg was pre -soaked for about half an hour and dried for 15 min to remove excess water. The white rice is prepared tr aditionally by pounding in a wooden mortar (Shumban) with a wooden mallet (Shuk) and the powder mass thus obtained is called Yam . Finely chopped or powdered about 250 -300 gm dried bark of Yanglee (Albizia myriophylla Benth.) plant is mixed with required am ount of water and filtered. The filtrate obtained appears brownish in colour. A homogenous mixture paste is prepared by mixing Yam and Yanglee filtrate. From this paste mass, a cake like structure in the form of elliptical or rounded flattened mass is prep ared known as Hamei. Pressing a small portion of paste mass in between the palms does the preparation of Hamei cake in the form of a flattened mass. The shape, sizes and forms are changed according to the convenience of the practitioner. Preparation of Humao as a starter by Dimasa tribes, Assam (Das and Deka, 2012) Dimasa tribe of Assam prepared rice beer popularly known as Judima . The starter culture needed for Judima preparation is humao. For preparing humao, brown rice is soaked in water for 10 -12 hours at room temperature. It is then crushed with the barks of Glycyrrhiza glabra L. The mixture is then made into paste by adding water and flat cakes are prepared from this mixture and sundried (Chakrabarty et al., 2009). For preparing judima, rice is first cleaned and washed. This is then cooked and dewatered. After cooling it is mixed properly with humao in appropriate quantity. This mixture is then spread on a banana leaf for overnight and then transferred to an earthen pot and made partially air tight. Fe rmentation is allowed to take place at ambient temperature for 3 -4 days during summer and 6 -7 days during summer. The resultant juices are known as judima (Chakrabarty et al., 2009) . In similar manner the North East tribes used Acacia pennata bark, are cu t into small pieces and dried in the sun. Rice is soaked in water until it is softened. It is then grinded in a wooden or metallic mortal pestle called rimin along with the barks of Acacia pennata . A little water is added in order to make a paste. They ar e then made into cakes of appropriate sizes and allowed to dry for a period of one week. They can be stored for many months (Das et al., 2012). Preparation of Siiyeh/ Siye/Opop/Ipof /Ipoh by tribes of Arunachal Pradesh Das et al., 2012 ) Apong and Ennog / Sai Mod is are alcoholic rice beverage prepared by the tribes of Arunachal Pradesh and the Mising tribes of 2007; Das and Deka, 2012 ). Both bears very important place in the tradition of the people of their region. The starter culture used for their preparation is called Siiyeh/ Siye/Opop/Ipof /Ipoh which contains the yeast to carry out the fermentation. For preparation of ipoh rice is first dried and grinded into fine powder. This is then mixed Knowlegde for Global Development 49 with powder of see ds and barks of the locally available plants Veronia cinerea Less and Clerodendron viscosum Vent. This mixture is taken into a vessel called Dekchi and made into a paste using water of previously prepared apong . This paste is poured and spread on bamboo ma ts and made into disc shaped small cakes. They are then carefully dried over the fireplace or left in a cool place for 3 to 4 days. After drying they can be stored for up to a year (Tiwari and Mahanta, 2007). Similarly for preparation of Ennog/Sai Mod (bla ck beer) rice is first boiled and spread on a bamboo mat to cool. Simultaneously, paddy husk is filled into a large tin sheet or drum and allowed to burn slowly and evenly till they become black. The burnt husk, while still hot is mixed with the boiled ric e and allowed to cool. After cooling, the mixture is again mixed with crumbled ipoh cakes and transferred to bamboo basket for fermentation. Preparation of Khekhrii by the Mao tribes of Nagaland (Mao, 1998) Khekhrii is a unique starter culture prepared fr om fermented germinated rice in Nagaland by Mao tribes (Mao 1998). The ethnic alcoholic drink prepared using Khekhrii is called zutho or zhuchu . Water used for making khekhrii Standley) (fam ily Cucurbitaceae) shell from a spring (Mao, 1998). Mao tribes believe that if water is brought in any other jar it may spoil the starter culture. Rice is collected and cleaned and put into an earthen jar that is filled with water brought in the gourd shel l. Two pieces of charcoal and two fresh twigs of Elscholtzia blanda Benth. are also put into the jar. Khekhrii makers believe that the addition of charcoal pieces and Elscholtzia blanda are important, acting as antimicrobial regulators to keep fermenting r ice from contamination. The mouth of the jar is closed tightly with fresh leaves of Justicia adhatoda Nees. and the jar is kept in a warm place for 7 -14 days, depending on the room temperature. In general, it takes about a week in summer and two weeks in w inter. At the end of fermentation, a typical flavor comes out when the mouth of the jar is opened. After fermentation, the contents of the jar are poured into a sieve and the water is discarded, and the fermented paddy is kept inside the basket. The basket is opened after germination of the paddy has taken place. The germinated paddy is then dried in the sun and stored in a dry container for use as a starter, called khekhrii which is pounded into powder and used in the preparation of zutho or zhuchu , a trad itional alcoholic beverage of Nagaland. Preparation of Mod pitha (natural starter) by Deori tribe of Assam (Deori et al., 2007) Saol (rice grains), plant species (Table 1), Kula (a round bamboo utensil), Saloni (round bamboo utensil or sieving), Dheki (wooden grinder), Dhua sang (a rectangular frame made of bamboo), Soriya (aluminium utensil) and Kher (straw) are required for the preparation of Mod pitha (Figs. 1 -3). A handful each of cleaned leaves, fronds, barks, roots and bulb of the plant parts are put in a Saloni and kept for a day for sun drying. 3 - 5 kg of Saol is soaked in water for about 2 hrs, mixed with the dried plant materials and grounded in a Dheki. The grounded powder is taken out, sieved in a Saloni and the Knowlegde for Global Development 50 coarse part is returned to the Dheki for grinding. The process is continued until a fine powder is obtained. 2 -3 old Mod pitha are added to the mixture while grinding, which acts as an inoculant. Grounded powder is put into a Soriya , water is added to make a sticky paste and small round ca kes (2 -3 cm in diameter and ca.1 cm in thickness) are prepared. Cakes are then kept on clean, dry paddy straws spread on a Kula (a round bamboo utensil) and again covered with straws. Kula is then kept on a Dhua sang tied about 1 m above the fireplace in t he kitchen for drying. This procedure of baking continues for a couple of weeks until the Mod pitha becomes hard. Pitha is then ready for use in Sujen brewing. Unused Mod Pihta is stored in Tekele (small earthen pot), mouth of which is covered with a bunch of straws. It can be stored for 2 -3 months and can be used as and when required. Preparation of Marcha by the tribals of Darjeling and Sikkim (Tamang, 2010) Marcha are dry round to flattened, creamy, white to dusty white, solid ball which is used as an a mylolytic starter to produce ethinic alcoholic beverage in the Himalaya Regions (Darjelling hills, Sikkim) of India, Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet in China (Tamang, 2010). It has various vernacular names among the Himalayan tribes viz. Oryza sativa ) is soaked in water for 8 -10 h at ambient temperature and unheated soaked rice is crushed in a foot -driven, heavy wooden mortar and pestle. In 1 kg of ground rice, ingredients added include roots of guliyo jara or chilli, 1.2 g; and previously prepared marcha as mother culture, 10.0 g. The mixture is then made into a paste by adding water and kneaded into flat cakes of varying sizes and shapes. These ar e then placed individually on the ceiling -floor, above the kitchen, made up of bamboo strips inlaid with fresh fronds of ferns ( Glaphylopteriolopsis erubescens ), covered with dry ferns and jute bags and are left to ferment for 1 -3 days, depending upon the temperature. Completion of fermentation is indicated by a distinct alcoholic and ester aroma and puffy/swollen appearance of the marcha (Tamang, Kushi by the Deoris tribals of Assam (Das et al., 2012) The indigenous rice beer o f the Deoris is known as Sujen , prepared using starter material perok kushi . The plant materials used for and rhizome of Costus speciosus . All these are washed and cut into small pieces, dried and grinded using a specialized wooden grinder called as dheki . The Knowlegde for Global Development 51 mixture is then soake d in water in a vessel until the water becomes coloured. The whole mixture is added to grinded rice in a vessel in order to make dough. Round balls of about 4 cm diameter is made out of this and dried either in the sunlight or over the fire hearth by placi ng in a bamboo mat called as aaphey . After getting dried they are placed in a bamboo container called as kula the inside of which is laid with kher (paddy straw). Its mouth is again covered with kher and is kept over the hearth for storage. They can be kept in this manner for many months and can be used as and when required. Preparation of starter ( Ranu dabai ) by the tribals of West Bengal (Ghosh and Das, 2004) Ranu dabai is the starter used for preparation of Jhara/Harhia similar to Hnadia preparation by the tribes of West Bengal. Ranu dabai are the mixture of roots, barks, rhizomes, leaves of about 10 -12 plant species (Table -1) and binded with the rice flour. 10 Kg of rice grains are taken on a flat traditional utensil generally made of sliced bamboo (Soop) washed properly. Clean water is poured in it, stirred and decanted. The decanted wash -water is preserved in a bucket for future use. The most common plants viz. tuberous roots of Coccinia grandis (500 gm); leaves le plant of Vernonia cinerea ( 350 gm) and leaves of Plumbago zeylanica (250 gm) are taken and chopped and ground properly on Soop. All rest plant (50 -100 gm only) depending on the availability are taken and added for preparation which will improve the qual ity of the starter. In some cases 300 gm of Rauvolfia serpentina roots can replaces Coccinia grandis roots. Rice grains are then put in the pit of wooden husking machine (Dhiki) and where partially powdered a few (3 -4 large tablets for 10 kg of rice) old Ranu Dabai are added. After some time, the plant paste is also added to it and allowed to mix properly. When the rice grains are properly powdered and mixed with plant paste, it is then taken out on a sieve (Chakni) and the coarse part is returned to the wo oden husking machine. After completing sieving, woody and fibrous materials are rejected. The powdered material (Gunda) is now taken in a large vessel (Dikchi) and made into paste using the previously stored rice wash water. The paste becomes slightly gree nish- white and emits the smell of mixed herbage. Clean gunny bags are then spread on the floor under shade or inside the rooms. Different size such as small, medium and large (standard size is 4.5 -7 cm in diameter), are prepared by pressing with hand and arranged in rows on the gunny bags, where these are kept for 40 -60 minutes. Tablets loose some amount of water and become little tough. All the materials are taken in a large basket (Dhakiya) made of sliced bamboo. Clean and dry straw is spread on the botto m of the basket and some tablets are kept on it. These are then covered with straw and another layer of tablets is kept on it. The entire set is covered with polythene sheet and/or gunny bags and stored in a dark and warm place. The incubation period varie s from 2 -3 days in warm season and 4 -6 days in winter. The inside temperature rises considerably (fever) and the set starts emitting pungent Harhia -like smell. During this, a layer of cottony mycelia develops on the tablets. The fungal mycelia produce a ma t of Knowlegde for Global Development 52 black sporangia in damp weather or if stored for a slightly longer period. The tablets are taken out of the basket and are kept in single layer on large sized circular flat bamboo basket called Dagra and get dried under the sun for 7 -8 days. Now, th e Ranu Dabai is ready for storing and for use. Preparation of fermentation cake ( Ranu goti/ Ranu tablets ) by the tribals of Central India (Kumar and Rao, 2007) In the preparation of Handia and Mahua , Ranu tablets play an important role, act as yeast start er or fermentor, and help in fermentation of both beverages. Ranu tablets or Ranu goti are the mixture of roots, barks, rhizomes, leaves of about 20 -25 plant species (Table -1) and binded with the rice flour. The preparation is almost same with the preparat ion of Ranu dabai with only difference in plant species used and their ratio. For preparation of tablets, rice is soaked in water, pounded, and kept in shady place for drying. The plant species used in preparation of Ranu goti are collected mostly from forests in wild condition. The roots, leaves, bark, seeds of the plants are sun dried and pounded, powdered and dried in sun. The powder is mixed with flour thoroughly in the ratio of 1:2, and rolled in small pieces in the form of small cakes. These tablets a re kept in closed room for drying. After drying, these Ranu tablets or Ranu goti are used for preparing local beverages Handia . Preparation of Thiat by the tribes of and Begum, 2007) Leaves of Amomum aromaticum Roxb. are cleaned, sun drie d and ground into powder in a mortar made of hard wood of Schima wallichii (DC.) Korth (Thlong) by a pestle made wood of Docynia indica (Wall.) Decne ( Sura i). Then, 1 -2 kg of Oryza sativa L. soaked in water is also ground in a mortar made of hard w ood of Schima wallichii by a pestle made of hard wood of Docynia indica (Wall.) Decne ( Sura i). The process is continued until a fine powder is obtained. Thiat (natural yeast) cakes are made from the ground rice powder mixed with Amomum aromaticum Roxb (Kh aw-iang/Haw -iang) leaves powder, which are put in a cone -shaped basket (Khrie) and spring water (Um - pohliew) is added to make a sticky paste and small round cakes are prepared with standard size of 4 -5 cm in diameter and 0.8 -1cm in thickness. These cakes a re then kept in a round basket (Malieng) and covered by leaves of banana. A round basket (Malieng) is hanged on a bamboo made a rectangular frame, which is exposed to sunlight or tied about 1.20 -1.50m above the fireplace/hearth for drying until the cakes get harden and then are used for rice brewing as natural yeast. Preparation of Vekur pitha by the Ahoms tribes of Assam (Saikia et al., 2007) Vekur Pitha is the starter prepared by the Ahoms tribes of Assam for preparation of rice beer xaj-pani (Saikia et al., 2007). For preparing vekur pitha, dried in the sunlight for 1 -2 Knowlegde for Global Development 53 days . These are then grounded to powder and mixed with powdered rice in a vessel with some amount of water. To this powder of previously prepared pitha called ghai pitha is added which serves as a source of yeast. The mixture is then made into disc shaped cake s and wrapped with banana leaves ( Musa paradisiacal Linn.) and kept in air locked condition above the fire heart for 4 to 5 days. After getting dried, the cakes are known as vekur pitha which serves as the source of Saccharomyces cerevisae and can be store d for future use. MATERIALS AND METHODS Survey and documentation of preparation of Handia : A survey was conducted in 10 selected localities (Palbani, Takatpur, Roxy Road, Chhaupadia, Road and Baripada Hat) of Baripada city in the district of Mayurbhanj where preparation and large scale selling of handia is a normal practice. Information was collected on methods of preparation, raw materials used and frequency and timing of consumption through i nformal personal interview (N = 5 at each sampling point) among various tribal communities. Accuracy of the information was ensured through cross verification. Survey and documentation of plants in Bakhar preparation: Survey was conducted in different vi llages of Mayurbhanj district of Odisha and gathered information through questionnaires and personal interaction with native tribal people regarding the use of plants and plant parts in the preparation of starter culture and its detail method of preparatio n is recorded. As most of the tribals obtain the principal constituents in form of the powder plant parts from the market, so a survey was conducted by showing the plant parts along with their dried form. Accuracy of the information was ensured through cro ss verification. The plant specimens used in Bakhar preparation were collected, identified and deposited as voucher specimen in Department of Botany, North Orissa University. Medicinal uses of the same plants were obtained by interviewing (once only) tradi tional healers of 24 villages of the district (Figure -2). All of them were males with an average age of 46 years. Prior informed consent was not taken from the informants as most of them were professionals and reputed in their respective areas and prescri bed plant preparations for different ailments. Knowlegde for Global Development 54 Figure -2: MAP of Mayurbhanj district with sampling site (*) Knowlegde for Global Development 55 Collection and processing of plants: Bark, flower, leaves, roots, rhizome and young shoot of plants have separately been collected during field trips to different places of Mayurbhanj. The roots are dug out from the soil and the adhering soils were removed by shaking and washing. The leaves were plucked from the trees, washed properly and infected leaves were discarded. After collection, the healt hy leaves were dried at room temperature to maintain their green color and volatile oils, if present. The material is completely shed dried so long it does not allow for the growth of any type of fungi, molds, bacteria and other microorganisms. The dried b ark, flower, leaves, roots and rhizome are powdered separately by using mortar and pestle. Extraction of plants: Hundred grams of each powdered samples were dissolved in 200ml of ethanol separately in wide mouth bottle. The suspension was then filtered (Whatman No. 40) separately and utilized for studying antimicrobial properties and phytochemicals. Ethanol extract was dried in rotary evaporator (Sonax, India) at 40 \u00b0C and store in refrigerator for further study. Phytochemical Analysis: Qualitative phyto chemical analysis was carried out using methods described by Trease and Evans (1989). Each extract was screened for presence of alkaloids Burchard and Salkowskis reagents), fat Vibrio cholerae were used in the present study as discussed earlier by Panda et al., (2010). The antibiogram was carried out by adopting disc diffusion method using several antibioti cs. The result of the antibiogram was published in our earlier report (Panda et al., 2010). The agar cup method and MIC were used to study the antibacterial activity. Broth microdilution technique adopted using 96 , 2,3,5 -triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), was carried out to determine the MIC following the method as described by Eloff, (1998). Selected extracts were serially diluted in the 96 -well plate with an overnight culture of microorganisms (0.5 McFarland) g rown at 37\u00b0C to obtain the final concentration of extracts ranging from 78 to 2500 \u00b5g/ml. The microplate was sealed and incubated at 37\u00b0C and observed for the growth of the microorganism. 10\u00b5l of the broth from each wel l of 96 microtiter plate (MIC) and control wells were taken aseptically and plated on one day old MH agar Knowlegde for Global Development 56 plate as a point inoculum and allowed to dry for 10 min. under the laminar air hood. These plates were then sealed and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours and observed for growth of the bacteria. Absence of growth of the bacteria showed the MBC result of the respective bacteria. RESULTS Handia preparation includes two distinct phases: preparation of ranu or bakhar tablets and making of handia . Ethnomedici nal uses, Preparation of Bakhar or Ranu tablets Ranu or bakhar tablets act as starter for fermentation. Ranu tablets are mixtures of various plant parts (50%) and powdered un -boiled rice (50%). The plant species and parts thereof used for the purpose along with local names, family, parts used are listed in Table -2 along with its medicinal properties throughout India. Survey was carried out and plants are collected after documenting its ethnomedicinal uses are listed in Table -3 and Figure -3. Some species viz . Asparagus racemosus (L.) Kurz. and Benth. are commonly used by the t ribal of all localities while plants such Dioscorea sp. are rarely use. Depending on the season and availability in a particular locality, plant parts of one or more species are used. The accurate ratio of different plants used for ranu preparation could not be ascertained as the informants were reluctant to disclose the same. However, C. pareira forms the major part in most of the preparations ( 70%) followed by other plants in combination (1 -30%). R. serpentina and G. gummifera are used in very small proportion. According to one informant (Sama Singh, Male, Age -62) the ratio of the plant (root) is 6:2:1:1 ( C. pareira : H. antidy senterica ). Preferred parts and plants varied at different places. Dried root, stem and other parts used for the purpose, both as such and powdered, are abundantly and openly sold in the local markets (Figure -4. a & b). Powdered plant ingredients are mixed with equal amount of rice ( Oryza sativa L.) powder. A suitable amount of water is added to make dough. Ranu is prepared in the form of rounded tablets and spread over straw beds in layer over layer with a final thin layer of straw cover. After 3 days, the ranu tablets are picked up from straw beds and dried under sun for about 2 days and stored for use in fermentation of rice beverages (Figure - 3. e). These tablets are not only used for fermenting rice beverage but also used for treatment of various ailments.

Santal tribals also disinfect silk worm (tasar) eggs during indigenous rearing. From the study conducted in the various villages, it is evident that all tribes use some plants for starter preparation; however the type of plant varies from tribe to tribe and village to village. The tribal peoples of Sukruli and Karanjia block use the same plant viz. C. pareira, C. serratum, C. grandis , Dioscorea sp. for starter preparation. Similarly tribes of Bijatola and Rairangpur use the Figure -4: Preparat powder antidy senterica bark powder e. Drying of Bakhar in mats f. Bakhar in large quantity for sale at Baripada hata g.

However, the tribes of Samakhunta use different plants A. racemosus , macrophylla and W. fruticosa for the same purpose. This is an age old practice in these communities which is followed generation after generation. Preparation of Handia Mechanically de -husked rice is soaked and boiled in water. The cooked rice is dried on a bamboo mat under sun (Fig. 1d). A fter drying, the rice is mixed with required amount of powdered ranu tablets (approximately 10 tablet per kg rice), kept in a large earthen pot or handi (hence the name of the product) followed by addition of required amount of water.

Leaves are used for edible purpose. The mixture is kept untouched for 3 -4 days for fermentation. After proper fermentation a white supernatant was present at the upper layer containing 8 -10% alcohol called rashi , which fetches higher price. After 2 -3 days the fermented liquid is a llowed to trickle down through a bamboo sieve, collected in earthen pots and is ready for consumption (Fig. 1e & f). The taste of handia depends on the plants used for ranu /bakhar preparation. A bout 8 -10 bakhar tablets are used for 1 kg of rice, which toget her produce about 10 L of handia . The quality gets lowered on dilution. On an average, some 30% of families prepare handia for their own consumption. Per capita consumption amounts to be about 1 L/day. Consumption is much higher during summer and hence, it is essentially a summer drink (Figs. 1g & h). It keeps the stomach cool, protects from extreme heat and is also intoxicating. Handia preparation and selling is a secondary source of livelihood for tribals and some accept it as a primary occupation. It is used in all social, cultural and religious purposes and no social occasion is considered complete without it. The Santals believe i t to possess medicinal value, i.e. use it in the cure of jaundice, colic disorders and dysentery. Screening of phytochemical s and antimicrobial activity of plants parts used in starter The qualitative phytochemical analysis of ethanol extracts indicated the presence of alkaloid, flavonoid, carbohydrate, protein and amino acid, tannin and phenolic compounds and saponin in most o f the plants (Table -3). However, glycoside, steroid & sterols, gum & mucilages, oil & fats and triterpenoids were found in less number of test plants. Alkaloid, carbohydrates, and saponin are universally present in all test plant extracts. Preliminary scre ening of antimicrobial activity was evaluated by using agar cup method against eight human pathogenic bacteria are given in Table -4. The zone of inhibition was found maximum against S. aureus followed by S. sonnei and S. flexneri . Organism such as S. typhi murium and V. cholerae show moderate zone of inhibition while enteropathogenic and enterotoxigenic E. coli and P. aeruginosa show least zone of Knowlegde for Global Development 64 Table -4: Phytochemical screening of plant parts used for preparation of Bakhar Name of the phytochemicals Qua litative test Ar Cp Cs Cg Ds Es Gg Ha Ml Rs Sm Wf Alkaloid MR - + + + + + + + - + + + DD + + - + - + - + - - + + HR - + + + + + - + - + + + WR - - - + - - + - - - - + Carbohydrates MT + + + + - + + + + + + + FT + + + + + + + + + + + + BT + + - + + + + + + - + + Tannin and Phenolic compounds WFC - + + + - - + + + + - + WLA - - + - - - - + - + - - WGS - - - - - - - - - - - - Glycoside KKT + - + + - - - + + - - + LT + - - - - - - - - - - - BRT - - - - - - - - - - - - Proteins and amino acids BIT - + + + + + + + + - - + NT - + + + + + + + + + - + XT - + + + - + + + + + - + MLT - + + + - - - - - - - + Flavonoids WN - + + + - + - + - + + + WS - + + + - + - + - + + + Saponins HCT + + + - - + + + + + + + FT + + + + + + + + + + + + Steroids and sterol ST - - + + - - - - - - - + LBT - - + + - - - - - - - + Triterpenoids TCT - - + + - - - + - - - - Oil and fats WFC + - + - - - - + - - - - Knowlegde for Global Development 65 Ar- Asparagus racemosus (-) Absence; (+) Presence inhibit ion. No test organisms were inhibited by A. racemosus (root), C. pareira (leaf), Dioscorea (tuber), R. serpentina (leaf) extract. So these plant extracts are not subjected to further study on MIC and MBC. The MIC results among all test bacteria are summari zed (Table -5) and showed that extracts were able to prevent the growth of most of the test strains with selective activities. The growth inhibition of the test bacteria ranged from 125 \u00b5g/ml (w/v) to 1000 \u00b5g/ml (w/v) with the lowest MIC value against S. au reus (125, 156, 250 \u00b5g/ml) followed by S. sonnei (156, 250, 312, 500, 625 \u00b5g/ml). MBC test showed that in between 1000 -2500 \u00b5g/ml (w/v) concentrations, most of test bacteria were killed. DISCUSSION Preparation and consumption of cereal based beverages is a common practice in many Mid-Asian, Middle East and African countries (Hesseltine, 1979). These are known by different names at different places: sake in Japan, Shaosingiju and lao-chao in China, Chongju and Takju in Korea, Brem bali, Tapuy and Tape ketan in Indonesia, khao-mak (Lee, 2009).

The consu mption of rice beer prepared from rice is a common practice among many tribal communities residing among the tribals of Odisha and many of them have been preparing it since time immemorial. Among the Santal tribes of Mayurbahnj, it is prepared in almost ev ery third house. More or less all tribals are fond of drinks and consume during every ceremony, festivals, marriages, funeral feasts, and offer it to their, guests, gods and deities7.

It is taken as a light tranquillizer by Maria tribe of Baster (Sahu, 1996). It is also given to treat fever, dysentery, diarrhea and gynecological complaints (Usha, 1999). Mahua is given to treat dysentery by Baiga, Gond , and Kol tribes of Surguja district (Kumar and Rao, 2001). Ranu tablets are also us ed in treating cholera by Gond tribe of Surguja district (Kumar and Rao, 2001). The tribes of Mayurbahnj use handia in the cure of jaundice, colic disorders and dysentery (Panda et al., 2014). Plant ingredients are used in preparation of starter culture ( ranu or bakhar ) universally that are essential for fermentation of rice to prepare beverages. After surveying 12 districts of Odisha including Mayurbhanj (Dhal et al., 2010) recorded the use of bark and root of six plant species in the preparation of bakha r by the tribals. Singh, 1996 has r eported the use of several plant species viz. mature leaves of Allophylus cobbe (L.) Blume , tender leaves of Artocarpus heterophyllus (Lam.), in equal proportions together with lit tle chilli, are used in the preparation of Choarak , a local wine of Tripura state, India. Tribal inhabitants of tea gardens in Terai region of West Bengal use 12 plants, specific parts for particular purpose, for preparation of rice beer jhara or haria (Ghosh and Das, 2004). According to Ghosh and Das, 2004, Sweetness of the liquor is developed by the use of tuberous roots of Coccinia grandis L. (Voigt) , whole plant including fleshy roots cinerea L. (Lessing) and leafy twigs of Scoparia dulcis Likewise, young and soft leaves Clerodendrum bark of of Wattakaka volubilis (L.f.) Staph. Produce a bitter taste. Leafy branches of Plumbago zeylanica (L.) act as a process enhancer. Roots of Stephania japonica (Thumb.) Miers and Stephania glabra (Roxb.) Miers, are used for long storing. Roots of Mussaenda roxburghii (Hook.f.) and leaves of Artocarpus heterophyllus (Lam.), impart s weetness and yellowish tint to the liquor. The tribals of Central India use a number of roots, bark, rhizomes, leaves and seeds of some 21 plants for making ranu (Kumar and Rao, 2007). The tribals get the phytotherapeutic value of these plants through the drink. The use of specific plants and parts thereof is a tradition and passed through generations. However, due to the loss of biodiversity and fragmentation of habitat, all the plants are not available in the vicinity of a particular village. Wani et al ., 2011 screened presence of phytochemicals in A. racemosus root from Himalaya region, India. According their findings, both alcoholic and aqueous extracts confirm presence of carbohydrate, glycoside, mucilage and saponin. In a study conducted by Mandal et al., 2010 have shown antibacterial property of methanol extract of A. racemosus root against Staphylococcus aureus . However, in the Knowlegde for Global Development 70 present invest igation antibacterial activity was not recorded against any test pathogens with the ethanolic extracts of A. racemosus . Jhuma et al studied phytoconstituents from methanolic extracts of Cissampelos pareira flower and result revealed presence of al kaloid, carbohydrate, flavonoid, protein, tannin and terpenoids. In the present study similar results were obtained for presence of phytochemicals in the ethanol extracts except triterpenoids. On the other hand, leaf extract dont show antibacterial activi ty against any strain while root extract show good inhibitory property against S. aureus and S. sonnei . This may be due to presence of certain additional phytochemicals in root comare to leaf. Prasad et The same authors also evaluate the antibacterial activity of various extracts and result found that isoamyl alcohol had better antibacterial property against Bacillus subtili s, S. aureus, S. typhi and Proteus species. Similar type of results was also recorded by Vidya et al., 2010 during their study on the same plant. Khatun et al., 2012 studied the antibacterial activity of various extracts of Coccinia grandis and result foun d that methanol extracts showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. dysentrae, E. coli and S. typhi . These authors also investigated presence of phytochemicals such as flavonoids, phenols, saponin, tannin and terpenoids. Similar study conducted by triterpenoids reported by Syed et al., 2009 whereas proteins and aminoacid by Umamaheswari and Chattargee., 2009 while presence of both these phytochemicals in the ethanol extract right through the present study. Povendran et al., 2011 reported antibacterial activity of leaf extracts of C. grandis against Heliobacter pylori . Nevertheless, in the present study t he rhizome extract exhibited very good antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. flexneri and S. typhimurium . Poli et al., 1992 evaluated pharmacological properties of scaber and observed the anthocyanin, chalcones, fla vonoid, lactone and triterpenoids. In another study conducted by Kamalkannan et al., 2012 showed presence of alkaloid, carbohydrate, proteins and saponin while absence of volatile oil, gum, mucilage and steroid. The same authors studied the antibacterial p roperty and conclude that the methanol extract of Elephantus scaber has potential antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pyogene while no activity against E. coil, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and S. typhi. In contrary to this work the study conducted by Kumar et al., 2004 and Avani and Neeta, 2005 reported promising antibacterial activity against pathogens such as B. subtillis , E. coil, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. At this juncture, antibacterial activity was confirmed against S. aureus, S. typhimurium and S. flexneri whereas absence of activity against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. sonnei and V. cholerae . Tambekar and Khante[23] Development 71 evaluated antibacterial activity of Gardenia gummifera and result originated that this plant exhibit activity against Enterococc us aerogenes, Klebesiella pneumonae, S. aureus whereas no activity was evidenced against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. typhi, Proteus vulgaris and S. typhimurium. viz. alkaloid, flavonoid, glycoside, ster oid, tannin and phenolic compounds whilst absence of carbohydrate, protein and aminoacid. On the other hand, in the present study antibacterial activity was not observed by ethanol extract of G. gummifera except S. aureus (zone of inhibition 12 mm). Balla l et al., 2011 studied antibacterial activity of Holarrhena antidy senterica against Shigella and S. typhimurium . Study conducted by Preethi et al., 2010 validated antibacterial activity of H. antidy senterica against B. subtillis , coil, S. S. typhimurium. Chakraborty and Brantner, 1999 reported antibacterial activity of steroid alkaloid from stem bark of Holarrhena pubescens against B. P. Streptococcus faecalis and S. typhimurium. The present findings correlate with the study conducted by all these authors, relating to the antibacterial activity. Chakma, 2 011 studied antimicrobial activity of Madhuca longifolia fruit and conclude that the plant act as a potential agent against B. subtillis , E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Later, Gopalkrishnan and Shimpi, 2012 carried out pharmacological studied on ste m bark of Madhuca longifolia and result evaluated the presence of starch, protein, terpenoid, glycoside, saponin, tannin while absence of alkaloid, flavonoid and steroid. In the present investigation, antibacterial activity was recorded against S. aureus while E. coli and P. aeruginosa was not inhibited by M. longifolia extract. Nevertheless, the extract revealed presence of phytochemicals such as carbohydrate, protein, terpenoid, glycoside, saponin and tannin, and these finding are correlate with the study conducted by Gopalkrishnan and Shimpi, 2012. Harisaranraj et al., 2009 examine phytochemicals such as alkaloid, flavonoid, phenolic compounds and tannin in the root extracts of Rauwolfia serpentina. Deshmukh et al., 2012 studied on antimicrobial activity of indole alkaloids from R. serpentina and conclude that root extracts illustrate better antimicrobial activity in compare to leaf extracts against B. subtillis, E. coli, S. aureus and S. typhimurium . The same authors at preliminary level investigated pre sence of phytochemicals viz. alkaloid, tannin, 2012 studied antibacterial activity of R. serpentina and proved that ethanol extract showed higher zone of inhibition compare to norofloxacin against S. aureus . In the present experiment, ethanol extract of root exhibited antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. sonnei, S. flexneri and V. cholerae while leaf extract do not inhibit any test strain. Furthermore, the phytochemical study correlate with the study c arried out by Deshmukh et al., 2012. Knowlegde for Global Development 72 Hooda et al., 2011 reported presence of phytochemicals such as carbohydrate, protein, saponin, flavonoid, alkaloid and tannin in the root extracts of Smilax zeylanica . The present study finds presence of phytochemicals such as carbohydrate, saponin, flavonoid and alkaloid. Nonetheless, antibacterial activity is the primary information reported on ethanol extract of this plant. Parekh and Chanda, 2007 studied antibacterial activity of W. fructicosa flowers and result fo und that methanol extract exhibited potential activity against B. cereus, S. aureus, S. epidermidis , P. vulgaris, P. seudoalcaligens and S. typhimurium . Later, similar experiment carried out by Kumarswamy et al., 2008 showed promising antibacterial activit y against E. coli, K. pneumoniae , mirabilis, S. typhi, S. sonnei and S. aureus . Chougale et al., 2009 also studied antibacterial activity of fraction of leaf extracts of W. fructicosa with promising antibacterial a ctivity against B. subtillis, E. coli, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa . Further, Bhattarai and Bhuju, 2011 tested both leaf and flower extracts of W. fructicosa and concluded that methanol extracts have antibacterial activity against B. cereus, E. coli, P. aer uginosa, P. mirabilis, S. dysentriae, S. typhimurium and S. aureus. . Later, Gyawali et al., 20 12 establish presence of same phytoconstituents in addition with terpenoids. The detail study and uses of these plants clearly indicate that the presence of these plant materials and their bactericidal activity are mainly responsible for protecting and preserving starter cultures since traditional system of fermentation normally operates in unhygienic condition which sometimes contaminates the system and cause toxication of drinks. But due to the presence of antimicrobial chemical principles of these plant s or plant parts, they are able to continue such practice for generations without much decline in the characteristics of microorganisms involved in fermentation. CONCLUSIONS The study establishes the deep knowledge of tribal people in terms of selection o f plants for preparation of handia and the processing technique. The native skill of rice beer preparation using unique starter culture technique is well recognized. Both the Bakhar tablets and handia are used in the treatment of several ailments. Probably , this is central theme in the preparation of rice beverages by the tribals across the world. RECOMMENDATION It is possible that the traditional knowledge of beverage preparation along with various parts of different plant species used will be a useful lead for phytochemists and pharmacologists for further study. Once the efficacy of these indigenous drinks is scientifically established, the popularization of these remedies can be recommended in Knowlegde for Global Development 73 conventional healthcare systems for wider applications. Further work is required to fully characterize the predominant microorganisms and to establish their technological roles and contribution to product quality and safety.

ABSTRACT Several sources reported the advantages of synthetic fungicides in boosting food production. However, there are serious concerns and negative consequences associated with their us e on ecological and human health in recent years. Besides, pathogens' resistances to some of the most effective fungicides have been reported. These amongst others prompted search for alternatives. Plants offer an expanse of exploitable chemical space in t his regard which is unparalleled in nature and not beaten by combinatorial chemistry as yet.Extracts of higher plants have demonstrated a wide range of activity against plant pathogenic organisms. These plants extracts have been found to contain broad spec tra of phytochemicals (secondary plants' weaponry against pest and pathogen invasion. These groups of phytochemicals possess wide ranging chemical functional groups; by which they establish and bind to sites on target pathogens to ineffectuate them. Complexes of these chemical compounds occur and incrude extracts. Need therefore arises in t he present to identify, isolate and purify the active principle(s) in the extracts and to determine theone(s) effecting the reported kills and fungitoxity of the extracts. With the exception of neem assertive reports on their modes of action are unavailabl e. We have to understand the functional groups of the isolates, their position on the carbon skeleton of the principles, binding sites on target pathogenic species; and the metabolic process(es) which they affect and ineffectuate. This will aid in either synergizing or synthesizing them so as to combat the enormous and obvious challenges of fungicide resistance threating agricultural production and food security. This work reviews available literature in these regards. KEY WORDS : Plant extracts, secondary m etabolites, Plant disease, chemical characterization, MOA Knowlegde for Global Development 81 INTRODUCTION The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) of the Government of Nigeria listed the important field crops grown in Nigeria. These crops include yam, cocoyam, cassava, cowpea, groundnut, s orghum, millet, maize, rice, melon and cotton. According to Abate et al. (2011), FAOSTAT also included soybean as an emerging important field cropalso grown inNigeria. Statistics show that Nigeria is the worlds largest producer of yam accounting for 70 -76% of the world production. In 2008 for instance, Nigeria produced 35.017 million MT of yam valued at US$ 654 billion,on 3.045 million ha of farmlands (Kleih et al., 2012; Wikipedia, 2012). FAO (2006) on the other hand reported that Nigeria is the largest p roducer of cocoyam in the world, with 5.49 million tonnes of cormsproduced annually which accounts for 37 -40% of the worlds total. Similarly, statistics reveal furtherthat out of the 29.5 million MT of groundnut produced worldwideper annum, Nigeria alone contributes 1.51 -2.57million MTproduced on 2.09 million ha; similarly,0.53 million MT of soybean werereported produced from0.582 million ha of arable farmlands respectively (Abate et al. 2011, Soytech, 2011; Awurum and Uwajimgba, 2013). She is also the wo rlds largest producer of the grain legume, cowpea. Furthermore, Singh et al. (2002) noted that Nigeria produced 2.0 million MT of cowpea grains on 5 million ha per annum.Many socio -economic factors, pests and disease pressures however, threaten the susta inableproduction, storage and preservation of these staple foods as well as several leafy vegetables, fruits and spicesamongst others in the country (Awurum et al 2000; Abate et al., 2012); and these threats are projected to increase in the face of climate change challenges (Sadiku and Sadiku, 2011). Fungi represent the greatest number of pathogens responsible for these plant diseases and deteriorations (Ajibade and Amusa, 2001). Many species of fungi decimate agricultural crops or products in field, tra nsit or store. It has been reported that up to 8000 - 750,000 crop diseases are caused by fungi with between 50 - 200 species, races and/or biotypes attacking a single crop (Ragsdale, 1994; Madden et al., 2008). Infection by fungi interferes with normal ph ysiological function(s) of the host plant such as photosynthesis, biosynthesis, nutrient and water uptake among others, leading to great reductions in crop yield and product quality. Some pathogenic fungi such as Aspergillus spp. and Fusarium moniliforme produce toxins - mycotoxins - which cause cancer or may be nerve or organ poisons, making affected produce dangerous for human and livestock consumption (Ragsdale, 1994). The incidence of these plant diseases upon a susceptible host is dependent on the prese nce of specific conducive conditions of moistures in the atmosphere, in soil and/or on plant surfaces; in addition to optimum temperatures for infection and disease development (Ragsdale, 1994; Amadioha, 2012). Field phyto -fungal have been implicated in this regard. These stylet -possessing organisms puncture and burrow into tender, succulent Knowlegde for Global Development 82 plant roots sucking out vital growth factors from the i nfested crop -plants, creating portals of entry for pathogenic fungi and bacteria; reducing plant anchorage and vigour, and predisposing the affected crop to damaging infections. For example the yam nematode Scutellonema bradys and species of Melodogyne have been noted to attack yam in Southeast Nigeria, cowpea isseriously galled by members of the genera Meloidogyne spp. attack plantains and bananas in the rainforest zone of the country (Wikipedia, 2013). Emechebe and Shoyinka (1985) repo rted that pathogenic fungi are capable of causing up to 100% yield loss in crops. Worldwide, it is projected that 20 - 40% of potential yield of crops are lost annually to plant diseases (Sygenta, 2012). This may aggravate to 50%, particularly in Africa du e to climate change impacts, noted Sadiku and Sadiku (2011).It is estimated that globally these yield losses amounts tobetween 60 - 525 billion US dollars annually (Agrois, 2004; Sygenta, 2012). According to Amadioha (2012), in Nigeria alone, Nkama et al. (1994) estimated that 1.5 - 20 million tonnes of cereals, tubers and legumes amounting to 0.3 - 0.4 billion Naira are lost annually in storage due to fungal attacks. In a bid to control these devastating attacks, synthetic fungicides are employed.Without c ontroversy, fungicides contribute to yield increases in crop production. Adipala and Edema (1994) reported that the application of Mancozeb and Dithane M -45 significantly improved the yield of cowpeas in Uganda.In the USA noted Bernnett (2005), 1.5 billion pounds of onion was harvested from onion plants cared for with 0.8 million pounds of fungicides. Economic use of fungicides in agriculture translates to improved returns on farm investment. According to this source, in California apple growers invested 7 0 million dollars on various fungicides, and reaped an attractive 1.2 billion dollars while grape growers got 2.6 billion dollars as return on investment (ROI) of 128 million dollars in the same period. A total of 880 million dollar - investment in fungicide s by growers in the USA all together reaped the sum of 12.8 billion dollars ROI translating to US$1 fungicides investment to US$14.6financial returns for them. Fungicides play a very active role in production of high value crops with uniform appearances an d quality (Biobank, 2009). Highly intensive and developed crop farming as practiced in the USA and Europe, involves use of highly -bred crop varieties to maintain uniform crop height, canopy, fruit size and shape as well as overall appearance and quality of produce in mechanized farms. Without fungicides and other pesticides it will be difficult to grow such crops ofhigh horticultural characteristics in large monocultures given serious potential pathogenic challenges in the environment. In the USA, concluded Croplife (2012) many crops would not be produced commercially without fungicidal agents. However, the high intensity of chemical pesticide applications and/or their inappropriate applications in agriculture have become a serious cause of concern in recen t years reported Biopesticides (2012). Several demerits are obviouslyassociated Knowlegde for Global Development 83 with use of these synthetic fungicides in agriculture and pest controlhave been reported such as pathogen resistance, pathogen resurgence, effects on non -target species, ecolog ical and human health concerns among others. Resistance to chemical agents is a very serious matter. Recently FAO according to Par and Rajul (1994) noted 150 fungal pathogens to exhibit resistance to fungicides. Some authorities assert that evolution of races and biotypes of pathogens to previously effective chemical agents occur 5 -10 years after introduction of the agent (Oreason, 2010; Pallant, 2010).Besides, synthetic pesticides leave undesirable residues in the treated food materials and the environmen t. Some of these residues retain their toxic properties for a long time in the food chain, impairing metabolic processes when consumed by non -target species. These and many other factors gave impetus for alternatives to be sought (Awurum et al., 2005; Okwu et al., 2007; Amadioha, 2012).Some of the preferred alternatives are: Use of natural enemies of the pathogen such as Trichoderma sp., Gliocladium sp., Bacillus thurengiensis and Baculoviruses in managing challenges from the pathogen (Carsons Silent Sprin g, 1963). Use of Intercropping to forestall and manage pests and pathogens problems in smallholder farms (Awurum et al., 2001). Farming systems re -design, through adopting crop rotation practices, proper field sanitation, good crop density, improved field aeration, and furrow instead of overhead sprinkler irrigation systems etc., so as to reduce predisposing crops to fungal attacks (Abawi and Hunter, 1979; Anonymous, 2012). Use of botanical pesticides such as neem (Azatin, Bioneem, Tomco and Mangosan)and e xtracts of other higher plants to combat challenges from phyto - pathogenic organisms (Amadioha and Obi, 1998; Amadioha, 2002; 2003; 2004; Awurum et al., 2005) This review focuses on use of botanical pesticides in plant health management. Many higher plants of the rain forest are being screened for fungicidal properties (Amadioha. 2001; 2002; 2003). Several workers have conclusively asserted the fungitoxic properties of these plant -based extracts for management of phyto -fungal diseases (Olufolaji, 1999; Awur um et al., 2005; Opara and Obana, 2010). These extracts have been reported to have the merits of being readily available in faming localities of the tropics, cheap, eco - compatible, less harmful to non -target organisms and useable in Integrated Disease Mana gement (IDM) programmes for smallholder resurce -poor farmers. They are also reported to provide sustainable disease management solutions especially in organic farming where synthetic pesticides are non -tolerable. Above all, they are systemic and contain mu ltiple bioactive metabolites which make pathogens resistance to them et al., Opara and Obana, 2010; Gurjar et al., 2012). Knowlegde for Global Development 84 USE OF PLANT EXTRACTS IN PLANT DISEASE CONTROL According to Cowan (1999), initial screening of plants for antimicrobial activities; begin with their crude aqueous or alcoholic extracts.Literatureavailable to us indicated thatextracts of wild Ipomea carnea and isolates of Penicillin sp had fungitoxic Heminsthoporium oryzae , H. sativu m and Colletotrichum capsici which affect paddy rice, wheat and chilli respectively (Narian, 1970). Many plant extracts as pesticides have been reported to inhibit spore germination and mycelial growth of pathogenic fungi (Amadioha and Obi, 1998; Olufolaji , 1999).These crude extracts were evaluated in vitro for activities against germination of the spores and mycelial growth of the pathogens, and later, for in vivo inhibition of the development and spread of the organisms in actual field conditions.Gurjar et al. (2012) however argued that majority of these works on extract evaluations against pathogenic organisms were conducted in vitro . The use of plant extracts in plant protection is summarized in Table 1. They have been found effective against seed -inhabit ing pathogens, soil dwelling, nutrient and water uptake impairing organisms such as the wilt -inducing Fusariumoxysporium and rootknot nematode 1999; Amadioha, 2001; 2003). They have also proven effective for arresting the development and spread of bacteria -induced diseases of vegetables and tuber crops. Several plant extracts hav e been evaluated and found efficacious against pre- and post -emergence damping -off, post -harvest rot and transit -decay inciting pathogens of great implications in threating post -harvest storage and preservation of produce in agriculture such as of Gupta al., 2012; Islam and Faraq, 2012). For exa mple, recently phytochemicals from some tropical plants (Carica papaya and and Awurum,2012).Okigbo the isolation of Botrydiplodia theo bromae as the most virulent amongst other pathogenic rot fungi from cocoyam corms in Southeast Nigeria and showed that extracts from Allium sativum andAzadirachta indica were the most fungitoxic against them. Similarly, Amienyo and Ataga (2007)indicated also that 30% strength of extracts of Alchornea cordifolia leaves reduced development of rot in mechanically injured and artificially inoculated sweet potato by the same organism to the tune of 46%. In an evaluation in sorghum, Cymbopogoncitratus (30% strength) completely inhibited the growth of Colletotrichum graminicola and Phoma sorghomi causing seed and seedling rot in the plant (Somda and Sereme, 2007). Gupta etal. (2012) reported that extracts from Eucalyptus terticornis and A. indica improved seed germina tion and seedling vigour by decreasing the pre and post -emergence mortality and number of seedlings showing symptoms of black mould in attacked onion.Greenhouse studies conducted in Southeast Nigeria revealed that Piper guineense and Carica papaya extracts inhibited the Knowlegde for Global Development 85 development and spread of anthracnose caused by C. destructivum and the results compared well with a placebo. In field trials, Awurum and Nwaneri(2011) and Awurum and Ogbonna (2013) reported extracts from Dennettia tripetala and Spondias mom bin comparable in fungitoxic effects to benomyl in Choanephora cucurbitarium -induced wet rot of -farm research depicted that while in Cameroun, Ambang et al. (2011) found methanoic extracts of Thevetiaperuviana effective in controlling cercospora leaf spot against Fusarium wilt of the same crop; and both reports compared well with benomyl treated plants. In Kenya, experiments on -farm on Common bean ( Phaseolus neem inhibited Fusarium . in amended soils better than tobacco, Mexican marigold and periwinkle (Obongoya et al., 2010). There is something to note here however that in soil amendment trials, combinations of extracts involving 500 extracts from different families/genera showed antagonistic, synergistic and neutral effects. Glove and black pepper (1% concentration) combination for example, was found synergistic against mycelial growth and sclerotialformation o f the pathogen Sclerotium cepivorium while antagonism was observed in all extract combination involving allspice, and clove and cinnamon at 0 -3% against the organism (Montes -Belmont and Prados -Ligero, 2006).Theseevaluations in general clearly demonstrated that the plant extracts from a wide range of families are potently efficacious in cultures, glasshouse studies and in field trials in inhibiting mycelial growth of diverse organisms,arresting their spore germinationanddevelopment as well as spread of path ogenic diseases from both artificially and naturally infected plants in actual field conditions.

The use of these natural products for pathogenic disease management is particularly imp ortant and necessary in the developing economies of the world like Nigeria where synthetic fungicides are not only unavailable but farmers who produce about 98% of food in the country are poorly equipped to handle them making their use uneconomic for res ource -poor farmers. Phytochemical evaluation of extracts It has been noted that, despite the use of plant extracts in ethno -medicine, African cuisines and recently in plant protection, that their phytochemical composition and active ingredients have notb een fully documented (Okwu and Njoku, 2009). Corroborative studies estimated that only 4% -10% of the 250,000 plant species constituting the biodiversity of the worlds flora have been examined chemically for antimicrobial activity (Earnsworth, 1990; Palla nt, 2010). Ahuge potential therefore exists in this regard; especially in the tropical areas like Nigeria with vast untapped rainforest, for these fungitoxic plant species to be extensively examined chemically. Scientific analysis of plants it has been obs erved follows a logical pathway beginning with a lead from the natives. Hence, Cowan (1999) reported further, that initial aqueous and alcoholic screening of plants extracts for antimicrobial activities are followed by other organic extraction methods for determination of their phytochemical compositions. According to Wessells and Hopsons (1988), marvelous assortments of chemicals which are noxious to pathogens and even pests, have been found to be present in plants. These antimicrobial constituents Chukwuma, 20 12). The phytochemical constituents of some plant materials used in plant protection are presented in Table 2. They may be qualitatively represented or quantitatively documented (Edeoga et al., 2005; Jeruto et al., 2011). In a qualitative evaluation, Ayod ele et al. (2009) reported the absence of alkaloids and anthraquinones from the leaves, stem bark and root of Ficus exaspeata . Quantitative documentation of phytochemicals in plant materials are presented in mg/100g of dry weight of specimen, g/100g of wei ght of the specimen (Aliyu et al., Harisaranraj et al., 2009; Okwu and Iroabuchi, 2009; Senthilkumar et al., 2011) or as percentages of weight per volume (w/v) of extract (Edeoga et al., and A wurum, 2013). This review will only present results expressed as percentages. Studies show that sometimes there may be disparity in the reported yield values of these phytochemicals by different Knowlegde for Global Development 95 investigators. For instance,Enyiukwu and Awurum (2013) report ed 1.63% alkaloids present in the seeds of Piper guineense which figure differed hugely from the value 5 -8% noted in Purseglove (1976). This difference in values the authors attributed to influences from time of harvesting of the plant materials, extractin g solvent, and method of extraction. The latter two factors seem most important to the reviewers. Variation in extracting methods are usually dependent on the length of the extraction period, solvent used, solvent pH, temperature, particle size of plant m aterial and the solvent -to- sample ratio. According to Gurjar et al. (2012), the finer the particles size the higher and better the rate of extraction. Furthermore, in a study by (Elloff, 1998) it was found that 5 minutes extraction of very fine particles o f diameter 10 nm gave higher quantities of phytochemicals than values obtained after 24 h in a shaking machine with less finely ground materials. Later investigations revealed that solvent -to-sample (solvent to dry weight) ratio of 10:1 had proved ideal f or extraction of phytochemicals (Green, 2004; Gurjar et al., 2012).The observed differences in the yield of phytochemicals amongst parts (leaf, stem, bark, flower, seed) of the sameplant, the authors further added may be occasioned by factors of age of the plant, plant part, sex and cultivar used in the investigation. Enyiukwu and Awurum (2013) noted that in a study at Cornell University, that male Carica plants yielded more phytochemicals than female ones and older plant parts yielded more than the young o nes. Similarly, it was also noted in the samestudy that the potency of activity of the yielded phytochemicals were age of plant or plant part dependent. For instance, phytochemicals from young plants or plant parts were observed to be more active than thos e from older plants or plant parts.Variations in yield values of phytochemicals may also be occasioned by the climatic and edaphic variations in the geographic locations of growth of the plant (Pallant, 2010). Phytochemicals of the group alkaloids have c omplex structure. They are bitter tasting, colourless, basic, and toxic,and contain nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring.At room temperature alkaloids may be liquids or crystalline solids (Okigbo etal., 2009). They are the most physiologically active compounds of medical importance found in plants. Alkaloids and their derivatives are used as basic starting points for drugs. They possess antifungal and bactericidal properties (Okwu and Uchendu, 2009). Karlovsky can inactivate enzym es, block ionchannels, interfere withneurotransmission and cause loss of electrical coordination (ataxia) in organisms. Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds possessing 15 carbon atoms made up of two benzene rings joined by linear carbon chain. They repr esent the most common and widely distributed class of plant phenolics. Flavonoids are a class of secondary metabolites known most commonly for their antioxidant and free radicals scavenging activities. Aside of prevention oxidative cell damage, flavonoids also play roles in combating allergies and microbes (Okigbo et al., 2009). Some flavonoids of the sub -class isoflavonoids, exhibit high pesticidal activity by anaesthetic -like action related to Knowlegde for Global Development 96 electron transport blockade in the mitochondria brought about by inhibiting oxidation linked to NADH 2.

Knowlegde for Global Development 100 Tannins comprised of a large assemblage of natural products which have unpleasant taste and are employed in tanning leather (Okigbo et al., 2009). They have great natural diversity and generally are made up hydrolysable and condensed tannins (Okwu and Njoku, 2009). They have pain killing properties. Tannic acids are used for prevention of loss of plasma and limiting secondary infection in burn wounds. Tannins -rich p lants extracts are used by Asian natives for the treatment of ulcers. Tannins have uniquely high affinity for precipitating proteins and complexing with all kinds of biomolecules (Peru, 2001; Dharmananda, 2007). Phenols or carbolic acids are aromatic alcoh ols consisting of a benzene ring bonded directly to a hydroxyl group (OH) (De -Reuter, 2005). They are weakly acidic, and have long history of roles in antisepsis and disinfection (Okigbo et al ., 2009). They are used as the starting ingredients in the indus trial production of drugs, herbicides. synthetic resins and additives to inhibit microbial growth in various ranges of pesicides (Greener Industry, 2009). Phenolics slow growth, block microbial cell division and enzyme activity. According to Okwu et al. (2007) they caused swelling of fungal hyphae tips, plasma seeping and leaking around hyphae tips, cell wall distortions, abnormal branching or fusion of hyphae surface. Saponins are glycosides of both triterpenes and steroids known for the soap -like foamin g they produce in aqueous solutions. Saponins have a characteristic property of being bitter or astringent (Okigbo et al ., 2009). Their soap -like nature makes them useable as surfactants and adjuvants for vaccines to enhance macromolecule penetration (Wiki pedia, 2008). Saponins can ward off microbes and this makes them good candidates for treating yeast, viral and fungal infections. They are known to play a role in cytolysisby complexing with cell membrane bilayers (Okwu and Njoku, 2009) sometimes creating pores on them (Rongai et al., 2012). In recent years noted a study from Italy, plants of the family Brassicacaea have attracted scientific attention due to their high contents of glucosinolates. These glycosidic compounds have no biocidal activity in th eir native forms but are converted through enzymatic hydrolysis within living systems to their active forms (isothiocyanates) which have strong cytotoxic activity (Rongai et al., 2012). isothiocyanate (MITC) papaya (Morton, 987; Cornell University, 2012). BITC occurs in the range of 1.37 -1.96% in the Family Caricaceae (Tang et al., 2001). According to Reulas et al. (2003) BITC isolated from Papaya seeds is known to be a strong antifunga l compound. At 0.5mg/ml the compoundinhibited the fungus Alternaria alternata causing post -harvest rot of tomato. Later evaluations indicated that aqueous seed extract from C. papaya was superior to metalaxyl (ridomil) in inhibition effects against Phytoph tora palmivora inciting black pod disease of cocoa in vitro . Investigators believed BITC was responsible for this reported activity(Wokocha and Nwaogu, 2008; Enyiukwu and Awurum, 2013).Furthemore, for instance, Knowlegde Global Development 101 efficacy of Afromonium meleguata and Monod ora myristica seeds and Sclerotium rolfsii , the incitant of basal according to Okwu and Njoku (2009)were due to their high contents of alkaloids. Enyiukwu and Awurum (2011; 2012), also attributed the potency of Piper guineense extracts in the inhibition of spore germination, mycelial elongation, development and anthracnose ( Colletotrichum destructivum ) of cowpea in culture and glasshouse, largely to its high contents of alkaloid s and perhaps, terpenoids in the test seeds extracts. Similarly, alkaloids are also reported responsible for the fungitoxic activities of extracts of Raecimus communis and Datura several and Azadirachta indica contain bioactive terpenoids which have been implicated for activities against a broad array of plant pathogenic fungi and bacteria (Gurja et al., 2012).Amadioha and Obi (1998) in a study with spices suspected and attributed the potency o f extracts of Xylopia aethiopica againt C. lindemuthianium the incitant of antheacnose of cowpea to perhaps the presence of xylopic acids in the plant materials. Functional chemical groups In a study on cocoyam in Nigeria, it was inferred that rot causing fungi produce pectinolytic and cellulolytic enzymes which degrade cell wall polymers and as such make available carbon sources for the invading pathogens. Ocimum basilium extract which inhibited the rot -causing fungi in the study was seen as possessing ac tive principle(s) that arrested the ravages of the pathogens or their enzymes or both (Ugwuoke et al., 2008).Tests with infra -red reveal that these phytochemicals, according to several workers, contain many chemically potent functional groups. Functional groups are specific groups of atoms or bonds within molecules that are responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of the molecules. Same functional groups are known to undergo same or similar chemical reaction regardless of the size of the molec ule it is a part of. However its relative reactivity is modified by nearby functional groups. Functional carbonyls, esters, aldehydes, phenyls, hydroxyls, functional groups extracts (isolates) establis h bonds with target enzymes, hormones, organelles or processes of pathogens to their harm (Brown, 2006; Okwu and Ukanwa, 2010).Echeverrigaray et al (2010) reported that hydroxyl and carbonyl groups or substituents on carbon skeletons of various monoterpene s are responsible for their inhibitory activity against soil inhabiting nematodes. The report further suggested that in addition, the position of these functional groups also influence the observed activity. Malheiros et al . (2005) in agreement from a para llel study, reported that dramane sesquiterpenes from Drimys brasilliensis inhibited a variety of human myco -pathogens including the stubborn Epidermophyton floccosum ; and showed that their activity decreased 8 times (from 3 mg/ml to 25 mg/ml) when a bulk y substituent ( p- methoxy or p-hydroxycinnamoyl) is Knowlegde for Global Development 102 present in carbon position 1. Some of the essential functional groups of a phytochemical are listed in Table 3. Table 3: Infra -red analysis of isolates from Afromonium meleguata and Monodora myristica for functional groups. Plant Isolate Frequency Functional group Compound type Reference Afromoniun meleguata seed Okwu and Uchenna (2009), many other functional groups exist in these phytochemicals besides the ones shown above in Table 3, such as pyrones,double and triple bonds etc. These chemically reactive groups have been postulated to be isolates Knowlegde for Global Development 105 arsenals of attack against metabolic sites and enzymes of pathogens (Okwu and Ukanwa, 2010) and even host plants in the case of phytotoxic chemicals (Echeverrigaray et al., 2010). Characterizedisolates of some extracts The effec tiveness of the activity of phytochemicals against pathogenic organisms has been reportedly suggested to depend on the type and concentration of bioactive principles they contain (Owolade and Osinkalu, 1999). In India, Stripathi and Poongothai from bioassay -guided fractionation of Pisonia glandis a topical medicinal plant, isolated fraction A inhibited the fungus Monascus purpureus better than clotrimazole a standard drug against its infections in humans.Of all the plant materials liste d in Table 1 above, reportedly used in many researches on toxicity to phyto -parasites, only neem ( Azadirachta indica ) has been most extensively studied, characterized; and asserted to contain the terpenoid azadirachtin. Scott et al., (2002; 2005) also docu Piper guineense contain the piperine and tuber blight of potato. Guie et al. (2003) indicated the isolation of flavanolglycoside isorhamnetin from Alchornea cordifolia. Later investigation glycoside in Alchornea cordifolia , andfingered this antimicrobial properties (Okwu and Ukanwa, has been isolated from Drimys brasilliensis (Malheiros, 2005). The compound has been found to exhibit insect antifeedant, antimicrobial activities as well as fungicidal activities to yeast, filamentous fungi and the medically difficult to eradicate endomycotic et al , 2005). Recently a few other plant material s have been examined chemically and their active principles isolated, characterized and documented Table 3. Table 4: Some characterized plant materials with antimicrobial activities Limonene, Ita et al., 2010 Knowlegde Global Development 107 Beta-caryophyllene Limonene Affia et \" Ricinus cumminis L. Ricinine, Ricininoleic acid \" \" Plants contain a marvelous array of potent and bioactive chemical compounds which play roles in warding off microbial, pest and herbivoral attacks. A source noted that 12, 000 of such chemical compounds have been isolated from the plant kingdom. In the thoughts of Pallat (2010), these are still infinitesimal compared to the enormous chemical space provided by the 250,000 species constituting the worlds flora. Identification, isolation, characterization and purification of novel potent compounds of plant origin will pave way to sustainable food production; reduceeco -contamination while delaying or reversing pathogen resistance to plant health management chemicals. Knowlegde for Global Development 110 Mode of acti on of isolates from biopesticides Mechanism of action (MOA) of a chemical substance refers to the specific biochemical interaction through which a chemical substance exerts or produces its effects. MOA includes a crystal clear mention of specific molecular targets to which the chemical binds such as enzymes or receptors. For example, in a related field of pharmacology, it is known that salicylic acid, acts by irreversible inhibition of the enzyme cyclo -oxygenase and suppressing the production of the hormone s prostaglandins and thromboxanes leading to pain relief. The demand for bio -pesticides especially botanicals however, are seriously constrained by dearth of knowledge of their modes of action, in particular their target specificity, and slow action. Thes e have put them in a serious disadvantage vis-a-viz the synthetic chemicals noted for their fast action. Despite the glorious potentials of plant extracts for crop disease management, they are also demerited in being photo and themo unstable, and like thei r predecessors the pyrethrins have short half-life, shelf storageability and are rapidly ultra -violent radiations (Kumar, 1986; Eno, 2011; Gurjar et (sodium channel modulators), nicotine (acetylcholine agonis transport inhibitor at cytochrome A ) whose modes of action have long been determined; of all the plant materials above, only azadirachtin isolatedfrom neem has been clearly reported to act by antagonizing prothoracicotropichormone (PTTH) of target organisms (Brown, 2006).From available literature, many reports only offer postulations on the modes of action of these bioactive metabolites. For example, in a parallel study, Okwu and Ukanwa (2010) suggested that anthocyanidine glycosid cordifolia inhibited Klesbiella sp and Staphyllococcus aureaus probably by the mechanism of membrane disruption or enzymes inactivation. Binding to adhesins, proteins, substrate deprivation, and intercalation into cell walls and DNA have b een advanced as well by many workers as possible mechanisms for the observed inhibitions (Echeverrigaray et al., 2010; Gurjar et al., 2012).Allicin (Alliaceae) is thought to be readily cell -membrane permeable and undergoes thiodisulphide exchange reaction with amino acids and proteins and its fungitoxic property is assumed pivoted on this attribute (Shusarenko et al., 2008). Besides it is also thought that the mode of action of allicin may also be by mediation of lipoperoxide production in fungal plasmamemb rane leading to increased permeability (Rongai et al., 2012). With regard to saponins, remarked the fore -going source, their mechanism of antifungal action is not well understood but it is believed to complex with sterols in the cell membrane leading to po res formations and consequent loss of cell membrane integrity.Furthermore, according to Brown (2006), cinnamaldehyde (Cinnacure, Cinnamite) a botanical pesticide is believed to impair energy production of target organisms. He however reported that its exac t mode of action is not well understood though interference with glucose uptake is assumed. Concrete studies to ascertain these claims and postulations seem lacking. However, experts maintain that unless something is done drastically to improve the effecti veness of biopesticides, the growth in their popularity will remain only gradual (Biopesticides, Knowlegde for Global Development 111 2012). We, as a matter of necessity must understand how these active isolates interfere with the physiology of the target organisms before thinking of improvem ents. To this end therefore, the challenges facing us in this area of plant disease management now are to determine: What constituent(s) make up the test extracts and what functional groups does the extract possess? What are their binding sites on the targ et pathogen? What metabolic processes or pathways do they affect by so doing? How do theytherefore effect the observed inhibitions and/oreffect kills on the target pathogen? In most cases listed in Table 1, these are notthoroughly understood yet. CONCLUSI ON Reports show that majority of the evidences of plant -based chemical activity against plant pathogenic fungi and other micro -organisms of agricultural importance were provided from in vitro evaluations. Crude extract evaluations have become very rudiment ary. Numerous phyto -chemicals which have demonstrated in vitro effects should be evaluated on -farm under natural or induced infections, to further determine and establish their efficacy in controlling the incidences of pathogen -borne diseases in crops in a multi -factor environment. Information on the active ingredients of plant extracts is sparingly available while that ofthe mechanism of action of isolates is almost non-existent.These are high profile, high -tech areas of scientific endeavours, and multi - disciplinary in nature.Therefore further focused and articulated researches to improve the effectiveness, target specificity and shelf storageability of botanicals are pressingly imperative. To achieve this, we must liaise and collaborate effectively with sc ientists in biochemistry, plant physiology, biotechnology, pharmacology and natural products chemistry. It is in the light of this kind of collaboration and purpose -guided assays that the much anticipated outcome of identifying, isolating, characterizing a nd understanding isolate -pathogen interaction which will lead us to the knowledge of the mechanisms of action (MOA) of the active principles of plant -based natural products will be achieved in the near future. SUGGESTIONS AND FUTURE TRENDS 1. Investigator s should be encouraged to conduct on -farm evaluations of crude plant extracts against a wide range of pathogens of various high value field and vegetable crops. In vitro trials have become too narrow for us to base our conclusion of bioefficacy of crude e xtracts against pathogenic fungi upon. 2. Given proven phyto -fungal toxicity of the plant materials and assertions on their effectiveness especially from actual field trials in the management of plant health challenges;many concerted and directed efforts and thrusts should hence be geared Knowlegde for Global Development 112 toward chemical examinations of the plant materialsin all future investigations with a view to: Determining their phytochemical compositions, Determining their chemical functional groups and their relative positions on the carbon skeletons, Isolating their active ingredients, Elucidating and characterizing the structure of isolates so as to enhance: Studies on their modes of action on pathogens, Phytotoxicity of the principles on host plants and, Possible means of impro ving their effectiveness and synthesis 3. Departmental collaborations should be sought with highly equipped and established laboratories in the USA, UK, China and India to enable investigators overcome complex issues of chemical structure elucidation of i solates and isolate -pathogen interaction. 4. Cost -benefit evaluations should be incorporated in our trials to scientifically establish the cost effectiveness of the plant extracts vis-a-viz synthetic chemical product rather than base this on guess works. Appropriate tests on the mammalian toxicity of isolates should thoroughly and speedily conducted to overcome the challenges bans after introduction of products REFERENCES Adjaye -Gbewonyo, D., Quaye, E.

In addition to this the chapters also scientifically validated how many of these plants are active to kill bacte ria responsible to cause infectious diarrhea. Aqueous and methanol extracts of 150 plants were recorded as medicinal value, of which 136 plants were tested for antibacterial activity using agar well diffusion against eight pathogenic bacteria involved in d iarrhea and dysentery. The results indicated that out of 136 plants species, 100 species exhibited antibacterial activity against one or more test organisms. In total 288 (144 methanolic+144 aqueous) extracts, 107 methanolic and 74 aqueous extracts express ed antibacterial properties. From the screening results showed highest antibacterial activity in terms of test plant numbers. against any test organism. Moreover, Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae are the two largest families from which plants did not show result significant activity against diarrheal causing bacteria. Among the to inhibit most of the diarrheal causing bacteria . KEYWORDS : Antidiarhheal, Similipal Biosphere Reserve, Preliminary screening, Plant extracts, Ethnomedicinal uses INTRODUCTION Diarrhea, particularly infectious diarrhea is the second leading cause of mortality and morbidity throughout the world in chi ldren less than 5 yrs of age. This is especially true in developing countries like India where there is poor sanitation and overcrowding. Knowlegde for Global Development 127 Estimation of crude death rate due to diarrhea in India was 9.3 per 1000 population (WHO, 2005). If this continues, th en the predicted case of burden will rise to 126.35 cores during 2016 (WHO, 2005). Among the leading causes of infectious diarrhea, Salmonella and Shigella contributes highest number . The current the chemotherapeutical treatment of Salmonellosis and Shigel losis is complicated as a result of drug resistance. Moreover, majority of the people in these developing countries have no access for modern health care facilities. This necessitated the search for alternative therapies such as, the use of medicinal plant s. Shigellosis is an important cause of diarrheal deaths. It has been reported that not less than 140 million cases of Shigellosis occur worldwide with 6,00,000 deaths annually, 60% of such deaths are of under 5 years old children (Peirano et al., 2006; Su r et al., 2004). Among the different species of Shigella, S. dysentriae is known for its fatality, and life threatening situation. The emergence of multiple drug resistant strains of diarrheagenic pathogens has made the treatment of dysentery more difficul t hence there is increasing interest in plants as source of antimicrobial agents for the treatment of such diseases (Munshi et al., 1987; Monroe and Polk, 2000). Salmonellosis, another type of diarrheal diseases is caused by a group of bacteria called Salm onella . It is primarily transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food by infected faeces from man or animal, through fecal oral route. Active cases of Salmonella in man are source of contamination and transmission to other human beings and to lower an imals. Strains of Salmonella species with resistance to antimicrobial drugs are now widespread in both developed and developing countries. In developed countries, it is now increasingly accepted that for the most part such strains are zoonotic in origin an d acquire their resistance in the food -animal host before onward transmission to humans through the food chain. On the other hand, indiscriminate use of commercial antimicrobial drugs commonly employed in the treatment of infectious diseases lead to high r esistance among the strains. This has forced researchers to search for new antimicrobial substances from various sources like the medicinal plants. Search for new antibacterial agents should be continued by screening many plant families. Several studies ha ve identified that the compounds within herbal plants are effective antibiotics (Basile et al., 2000). Traditional healing systems around the world that utilize herbal remedies are an important source for the discovery of new antibiotics (Okpekon et al. 20 04); some traditional remedies have already been produced compounds that are effective against antibiotic -resistant strains of bacteria (Kone et al., 2004). Diarrheal disease continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, p articularly among children in developing countries, often as a result of infection by bacteria, viruses, and protozoal parasites. Given the increasing resistance in many common pathogens to currently used chemotherapeutic agents, there is renewed interest in the discovery of novel compounds that can be used to fight infectious diseases. There have been numerous studies that have served to validate the traditional use of medicinal plants used to treat or prevent diarrhea. Several methods can be used Knowlegde for Global Development 128 for sele cting plants of potential therapeutic interest (Vlietinck and Vanden -Berghe, 1991; Farnsworth, 1993). The search routes: random, ethno (including ethnobotanical, ethnomedical and ethnopharmacological) and (Fabricant and Farnsworth, 2001). The ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological approach uses information obtained from traditional medical practitioners and other people such as village elders and local women who are traditional users of medicinal plants. Ethnomedicin al reports are available on the use of plants for the treatment of diarrhea and dysentery by the tribals from district Mayurbhanj (Rout and Pandey, 2002; Pandey and Rout, 2002; 2006; Rout and Panda 2010, Panda et al., 2011a,b,c; Panda et al., 2012; Panda, 2014). There is limited information on the safety of traditional plant extracts, although some clinical trials have evaluated the safety and tolerability of herbal medicine preparations used to treat diarrhea and generally indicate that minimal side effect s are observed. Based on earlier reports and data collected from the present ethnomedicinal uses, plants were selected to find out the experimental validation of tribal knowledge for the curing of infectious diarrhea. LITERATURE REVIEW Diarrhea poses a si gnificant economic and societal burden throughout the world both in developing and developed countries. Annually, more than five million people, 80% of whom are less than one year of age, die from acute infectious diarrhea (Sood and Pacheco, 2002). Additio nal agents of infectious diarrhea for which clinical diagnostic testing is not routinely available include enterotoxigenic, enteropathogenic, enteroaggregative, and enteroinvasive strains of E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and rotaviruses (Guerrant, emergence of multiple drug resistant strains of diarrheagenic pathogens has made the treatment of dysentery more difficult. In developing countries, the majority of people living in rural areas a lmost exclusively use traditional medicines in treating all sorts of diseases, including diarrhea. A range of medicinal plants with anti -diarrheal properties have been widely used by the tribes of Mayurbhanj. The effectiveness of many of these plants has n ot been scientifically evaluated. Diarrhea: Definition and related terms Diarrhea is loosely defined as an alteration in the normal bowel movement characterized by an increase in the volume, frequency and water content of stool (Baldi et al., 2009). The p atho -physiology of diarrhea include microbial and parasitic infections (Hodges and Gill, 2010), stress (oxidative or physical) (Soderholm and Perdue, 2006), dysfunctional immunity (Schulzke et al., 2009), disrupt GIT integrity and neurohumoral mechanisms ( Vitali et al., 2006; Spiller, 2004) . Diarrhea can also be a symptom of other diseases such as cholera, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroenteritis (intestinal inflammation and ulcerative colitis) (Schiller, 1999; Baldi et al., 2009), malaria (Gale et al., 2007) and diabetes mellitus (Forgacs and Patel, 2011) etc. Knowlegde for Global Development 129 Classification Diarrheal disease can be either infectious or non -infectious in nature. In infectious diarrhea, the potential causative pathogens include bacterial agents (Mathabe et al., 2006) , rarely fungal (Robert et al., 2001), viral and parasite pathogens (Brijesh et al., 2006). Non -infectious diarrhea can be caused by adverse reactions to drugs, toxins, allergy to food, poisons and acute inflammation which promote the release of secretagog ues and some enteric nervous system (ENS) receptors (prostaglandin, serotonin, substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptides, and hormone) in the GIT (Wynn and Fougere, 2007) . Diarrhea can be classified in several ways viz. according to the duration of the symptoms (Acute, persistant, chronic); according to stool characteristics or pathological mechanisms (watery, osmotic, altered motility or inflammatory diarrhea) (Ravikumara, 2008); according to age group (infantile, weanling, childhood, adult); based on epidemiological pattern (sporadic, endemic, epidemic, pandemic); based on seasonal (summer, winter, monsoon) etc. Plant metabolites as potential therapeutic agents Since ancient time, plants have been used as medicines by peoples. Today, the majority of people in the world use traditional medicines for their primary course of treatment because (i) biomedical healthcare systems and pharmaceuticals are not available in most places, (ii) Synthetic drugs are not safe. Thus, to improve health and to instill pride in traditional knowledge systems, several governments (e.g., China, India, and South Africa) are incorporating traditional healthcare practices into their national regimes (WHO, 2003). Medicinal plants have therapeutic properties due to biosynthesis of various complex phytochemical substances grouped studies of phytochemicals in plants ha ve shown that they exhibit various medicinal uses (Van Wyk and Wink, 2004). Synergistic interaction among the multiple phytochemicals may be responsible for the overall bioactivity of a given medicinal plant. Several plant extracts, formulations, or pure natural compounds are used in controlling diverse diseases incluiding diarrhea to parasitic infection in both human and veterinary medicine. Plant -based remedies in improving diarrhea Ethnobotanical theories support the effectiveness of plants for therape utics, incliding all type of gastrointestinal diseases. All animals including humans have develop senses to select appropriate plants for ingestion, digestive enzymes to acquire nutrients from plants, and behaviors or detoxifying enzymes to neutralize harm ful plant chemicals (Johns, 1996). Due to the widespread occurrence of diarrhea as a disease together with the prevalence coinciding with human development, plants have featured widely in the management of the disease both in human and veterinary medicine s. Johns (1999) postulates that \"fundamental forms of medicine involve the gastrointestinal tract\" Knowlegde for Global Development 130 because of the immediate cognitive link between ingesting effective medicinal plants and relief of gastrointestinal ailments. This cognizant association coul d be one reason why all known pharmacopeias of the world possess remedies for gastrointestinal illness. Another reason is that gastrointestinal ailments are ubiquitous. Therefore, the need for treatments is universal. Possible mechanisms of action for anti-diarrheal plants Plants may act in various ways in alleviating diarrhea. It also providing nutrients and generally increasing gastrointestinal health. However, for treatment purpose plants are known as anti -infectious agents due to their secondary m etabolites to fight against diarrheal pathogens. Antimicrobial: Many plant metabolites are known to exhibit some level of toxicity toward microorganisms. Numerous mechanisms of actions have been hypothesized to explain their antimicrobial activity such as microbial enzymes inhibition, deprivation of essential growth substrates, cell membrane disruption (Cowan, 1999) or direct interference with metabolic pathways. Antiadhesion: Adhesion of some enteric pathogen to the mucosa epithelium of the host cells i s the first important step in intestinal infections that may lead to the development of diseases (Ofek and Sharon, 1990). Application of antiadhesives chemotherapy can be effective only against microorganisms that depend on the surface contact with host ce lls as prerequisite for survival, multiplication and virulence (Lengsfeld et al., 2007). Antitoxin: Since enteric pathogens may induce diarrhea through the production of toxin (endotoxin or cytotoxin) the neutralization with plant antidiarrheal compounds may beneficial in the management of diarrhea. Activated charcoals processed from plants are also used as toxin binders. Immunomodulatory: With immune suppression being a pre -disposing, drugs or medicinal plant preparations with immune stimulating activit ies may help in attenuating many infectious diseases. Phytochemicals responsible for anti -diarrheal properties Much plant -based anti -diarrheal research has analyzed the effects of phytochemicals on intestinal tissues (Brijesh, et al. , 2006; 2007; Gutierrez et al., 2007). Using rodent models, extracts are evaluated for antispasmodic effects, gut motility suppression, or water and 2007) with tannins and flavonoids exhibiting promising results for water and electrolyte retention (Palombo, 2006). Knowlegde for Global Development 131 Astringent and pectin -rich plants often a re used to treat diarrheal disease, as are opiates that slow smooth muscle contractions of the intestines (Lewis and Elvin -Lewis, 2003). However, these remedies that suppress intestinal function block the symptoms of diarrhea and not the causes. Bacte ria, viruses and parasites are the major causes of infectious diarrhea, with bacteria leading highest (2 -4 billion cases of infection with 3 -5 million deaths per year (Sanchez and Holmgren, 2005). Phytochemicals inhibit the growth and virulence of diarrhea - causing bacteria in numerous ways. When bacteria invade the intestines, they follow similar etiologies. The sequence, known as the five stages of pathogenicity (Mitchell, 1998), includes: 1) adherence to host tissue, 2) invasion or control of host tis sues, 3) multiplication in host tissues or with nutrients from host tissues, 4) evasion of host defenses, and 5) damage and spread. Phytochemicals can inhibit bacterial growth or virulence at any of these five stages of pathogenicity. For example, muci laginous, astringent and fibrous properties of some plants can mechanically prevent bacterial adhesion to host intestinal cells by direct competition between plant -derived lectins and bacterial membrane glycosides (Couti\u00e3o Rodriguez et al. , 2001; Rabbani et al., 2004). Agents involved in causing diarrhea Bacterial causes of diarrhea Escherichia coli E. coli is a gram -negative rod shaped bacteria that shares a symbiotic relationship with animal host as part of normal digestive intestinal flora. Under ce rtain define conditions these organisms or pathogenic strains of these organisms are known to induce diarrhea (Clarke, 2001; Le Bouguenec, 2005). There are six main types of pathogenic E. coli associated with diarrhea, namely enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) , enteroinvasive E (EHEC), coli (EAEC) and diffusively adherent E. coli (DAEC) (Clarke, 2001). The characteristics and mode of actions of each type of the pathol ogical strains in diarrhea diseases are listed in Table -1. Table -1: Charecterstice of E. coli starins causing diarrheal diseases Pathogens Epidemiology Symptoms Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) Most common cause of travelers diarrhea. Most of the children are affected in developing countries. Watery diarrhea ranging from mild, self -limiting disease to severe purging. Enteroinvasieve E. coli (EIEC) Important cause of diarrhea in the areas of poor hygiene. Bloody, mucoid diarrhea and dysentery. Knowlegde for Global Development 132 Enterohaemo rrhagic E. coli (EHEC) Most important in human infection. Out breaks and sporadic cases all over the world. Bloody diarrhea, fever, vomiting, haemorrhagic colitis, haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUB), acute renal failure, haemolytic anaemia Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) Sporadic case and mostly occurs in baby Self-limiting watery diarrhea with fever and vomiting. Staphylococcus aureus S. aureus is a gram -positive coccus present in normal intestinal and skin flora of human and homoeothermic animal. Under d efine conditions, the pathogenic strains produces heat stable staphylococcal enterotoxins (SETs) and toxic shock syndrome toxins (TSST - 1) (de Oliveira, 2010) both of which are known to induce diarrhea. Upon ingestion of the contaminated food with the SETs, results diarrhea associated with fever, nausea and vomiting (Rosengren et al, 2010; Perez -Bosque and Moreto, 2009). In contrast, TSST -1 is characterized by sudden onset of fever, vomiting, diarrhea, erythematous rash with skin peels, hypotensive shock, im pairment of renal and hepatic functions. Toxicity results by way of the production of pro -inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Toxicity is usually aggravated by further interaction between the activated immune system and inflammatory mediators (Krakauer et al., 2001). Campylobacter jejuni C. jejuni is an invasive Gram -negative, spiral -shaped rod bacterium present in the GIT of mammals, birds and primates (Lengsfeld et al., 2007). The clinical signs of campylobacter infections include pyrexia, abdominal pains, watery diarrhea and dysentery (Podewils et al, 2004). The characteristic mechanisms Campylobacter infection involves invasion and translocation of the epithelium with a concomitant induction of inflammation (Hu et al., 2008). Shigella species Four species of Shigella (S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae, S. sonnei and S. boydii ) invades the colon with resulting inflammation and diarrhea (Podewils et al., 2004). S. flexneri is responsible for dysenteric symptoms and persistent illness while S. dysenteriae type-1 produces Shiga -toxin causes bloody diarrhea (Podewils et al, 2004), S. sonnei causes bacterial gastroenteritis and bacillary dysentery and S. boydii causes fever, chills, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Vibrio cholerae cholerae is a motile, facult ative -negative rod associated with potentially fatal diarrhea (Granum, 2006) that results from the ingestion of the cholera enterotoxins (CT) (Podewils et al, 2004). Watery, colour less mucous -flecked stool and vomiting are the main clinical signs associated with cholera which in severe cases can Knowlegde for Global Development 133 result in a life -threatening fluid and electrolyte imbalance (Podewils et al, 2004). Pathophysiologically, toxicity results from the CT induction of intestinal hypersecretion through the activation o f the mucosal epithelium and 2004). Other species of Vibrio such as V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus also caused watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting. Bacillus species B. cereus is a sporulating bacterium that causes diarrhea due to food poisoning resulted by enterotoxins such as haemolysin BL (HBL), non -haemolytic enterotoxin (NHE) and cytotoxin K (CytK) (Lund et al., 2000). Other species of Bacillus s uch as B. subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. pumilus and B. megaterium can also produce enterotoxins and emetic toxins involved in food borne illness but are usually considered relatively safe (From et al, 2007). Yersinia species Yersinia species are Gram -negative facultative anaerobic nonsporing rods bacteria belonging to Enterobacteriaceae family. Two pathogenic species Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis are responsible for yersiniosis with clinical signs such as diarrhea, vomiting, fever and abdomi nal pain (Linscott, 2011). Listeria monocytogenes L. monocytogenes is the only single species which causes life -threatening invasive diseases referred to listeriosis in human and animals (Chaturongakul et al., 2008; Todd and Notermans, 2011). Upon ing estion of the bacteria through contaminated foods, causes diarrhea by colonizing the intestinal tract (Chaturongakul et al., 2008). Clostridium species Three species of Clostridium viz. C. difficile, C. botulinum, C. perfringens are responsible for diarrh eal diseases. C. difficile causes a spectrum of diseases ranging from benign diarrhea to fatal colitis and most often as a consequent of antibiotics treatment. Most antibiotics predispose C. difficile overgrowth leading to the production and accumulation o f and diarrhea are Toxins A (enterotoxin) and B (cytotoxin) in the intestine. Both toxins A and B inactivate intracellular Rhoproteins by glycosylation, leading to desorption of the cytoskeleton, production of inflammatory cytokines and damage to tight jun ctions. In contrast, C. perfringens is an important food poisoning bacterium with clinical sign as diarrhea, abdominal cramping and nausea. C. botulinum play a role in diarrheal diseases due to botulinum toxin resulting abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting , diarrhea, double vision, long term nerve damage and possible even death from paralysis (Linscott, 2011). Salmonella typhimurium Knowlegde for Global Development 134 S. typhimurium is a bacterium that may be associated with mild gastroenteritis to enteric (typhoid) fever, bacteraemia and s epticaemia commonly referred to as salmonellosis (Mastroeni and Maskell, 2006). The clinical signs of salmonellosis include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps. Enterococcus faecalis E. faecalis is a gram -positive bacterium that survives symbiotically in the intestinal tract. However, under stress conditions such as the disruption delicate host -commensal relationship due to overuse of antibiotic use, abdominal surgery or changes in host immunity, the enterococci becomes invaders of the intestinal wall (Bu tler, 2008) through the production of adhesin, aggregating and binding substances (Butler, 2008). E. faecalis is known to produce superoxide (O 2-) that can results in hydroxyl radical formation which contributes to oxidative stress in the intestine and me mbrane lipid peroxidation (Huycke and Moore, 2002; Sun et al, 2010) resulting diarrhea. Other bacterial species Bacteria such as Klebsiellae species, Aeromonas species, Enterobacter aeruginosa and Plesiomonas shigelloides were also important bacteria involved in causing diarrheal diseases. Table -2: Clinical feuture of bacterial diarrheal disese other than E. coli Pathogens Incubation period Symptoms Bacillus Staphyloccus aureus 1-8 hr Vibrio cholerae, Klebesiella hr Diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever C. difficile 24-72 hr Diarrhea, abdominal cramps Salmonella, Campylobacter, Aeromon as, Yersania species and V. parahaemolyticus 12hr -11 day Diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever Shigella sp. 1-4 days Diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever Giardia sp. 1-8 days Diarrhea, fever Rotavirus, Norvirus 24-72 hr Diarrhea, fever Viral agents Several viruses belonging to Rotavirus, Norwalk viruses, Adeno viruses, Calciviruses, Coronaviruses, Astroviruses and Enteroviruses are responsible for causing diarrhea throughout the world. Knowlegde for Global Development 135 Rotavirus Rotavirus is a major cause of severe diarrhea due to the production of enterotoxin NSP4 which inducesd Na -glucose dependent malabsorption and destruction of enterocytes (cytotoxicity). The toxin also has a direct effect on the intestinal barriers by blocking TJs formation with resultant diarrhea through a l eak flux mechanism in which water is secreted into the lumen of the intestine (Dickman et al., 2000). Norovirus Norovirus is considered as major global causes of gastroenteritis resulting diarrhea (Mattison, 2010). The disease is opportunistic with cl inical signs viz. nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pains (Koopmans, 2008). Hepatitis A virus Hepatitis A is a small, non -enveloped spherical with cubic symmetry, thermostable and acid resistant entero virus. It multiply in the intestinal epithel ium and reaches the liver. The clinical signs are dark urine, jaundice, malaise, weakness, fever, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pains, and diarrhea (Koff, 1992). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Chronic diarrhea is one of the complications associated with HIV infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) due to multiple enteric opportunistic microbes (DuPont and Marshall, 1995). While HIV is important in secondary enteric diseases as a result of immune suppression (CD4+ T -lymphocy tes destruction), the virus can result in diarrhea directly by altering the mucosa structural arrangement referred as HIVenteropathy (Epple et al., 2009). The diarrhea resulting from HIV appears to be caused by the releases of cytokines from the infected i mmune cells (Schmitz et al., 2002). Protozoa and Parasitic intestinalis G. intestinalis (syn. G. doudenalis, G. lamblia) flagellate protozoa parasite colonizes the small intestinal lumen and induces non -inflammatory and malabsorptive diarrhea (Schulzke et al., 2009). The pathophysiology of Giardiasis involves Na+ dependent D - glucose absorption impairment, active electrogenic anion secretion activation, mucosal inflammation and leak flux (Buret, 2007; Troeger et al., 2007). Clinical signs of include bloating, steatorrhea and nausea. Entamoeba histolytica Knowlegde for Global Development 136 E. histolytica is a protozoa parasite which infects the large intestine with resu ltant intestinal dysfunction characterized by invasive illness and severe dehydration commonly referred to as amoebiasis (Ralston and Petri, 2011). The pathophysiology of amoebiasis involves villus structural destruction and increase in epithelial permeabi lity (Lauwaet et al., 2004). The clinical signs are usually similar to S. dysenteriae or enteroinvasive E. coli with blood and pus contaminated stool. Other related infectious species include E. dispar and E. moshkovskii (Ralston and Petri, infects epithelia causing cryptosporidiosis which manifest clinically as profuse watery diarrhea containing mucus and some times blood or leukocytes (Kenny and Kelly, 2009; OHara and C hen, 2011). Cyclospora cayetanensis C. cayetanensis is a protozoan parasite which invades the epithelial cells of the small intestine (Chacin -Bonilla, 2010; Manfield and Gajadhar, 2004). The clinical signs of the infection include watery diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight loss, abdominal bloating and cramping, increased flatulence, nausea, fatigue, and low -grade fever (Linscott, 2011). Trichinella spiralis T. spiralis is a food -borne zoonotic parasite induced changes in intestinal function by hypersens itivity mechanism resulting in an increased intestinal chloride and fluid secretion (Cui et al., 2011). The clinical intestinal symptoms are nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea (Linscott, 2011). Fungal induced diarrhea by Candida albicans C. albicans is the only fungal originate organism is responsible for diarrhea and it exist as a member of normal flora in the GIT and mucocutaneous membrane. Due to overuse of antibiotic therapy that results in sterilization of the GIT flora, C. albicans can overgrowth to take the place of removed organisms with end result of diarrheal symptoms (Henry -Stanley et al., 2003). Other predisposing factors include altered intestinal permeability and diminished host immunity response. It has been postulated that this organism produces virulence factors which increases fungal adherence to host cells and secretion of proteolytic enzymes (Henry -Stanley et al., 2003). Clinical signs associated with enteric candidiasis are abdominal pain, cramping, rectal irritation and absence of nausea, vomiting, bloody and mucus stool, and pyrexia (Levine et al., 1995). MATERIALS AND METHODS The phytogeography of Similiapl Biosphere Reserve, Mayurbhanj, Odisha The Similipal Biosphere Reserve (Figure 1), one of the mega biodiversity zon es of the country, is situated in the central part of the Mayurbhanj district of Odisha (20o17 - Knowlegde for Global Development 137 22o34N and 85o40 - 87o10E) and covers an area of 5569 km2. The reserve has been divided into three zones i.e. Core Zone, Buffer Zone and Transition Zone. T he core zone (845Km2) is reserved for wildlife habitat development and no exploitation activities are entertained in this area. The buffer zone (around 2,129 Km2) is partially prohibited and is allowed for some activities like research, education and touri sm. On the other hand the transition zone, which lies in the peripheral region covering 2,595 Km2, is allowed for research, tribal settlement, tourism and other environment friendly activities. Health care in the tribal villages of Mayurbhanj In Similipal Biosphere Reserve there are 4 villages inside the core area, 65 villages in the buffer zone and 1200 villages in the peripheral zone. The human population in all being more than 4.5 lakhs, where tribals occupy about 52 % of its population and 53 communiti es, both aboriginal and migrated, inhabit the district glorifying the rich heritage of tribal culture. Among the tribal communities, the chief ones are tribes namely Kharias, Mankdias and Saharas are still in primitive state of living. Most of the villages are situated in the mountainous terrain of the district i.e. not well communicated with the district head quarter hospital. Till now the health care system are still sparse in the core areas. The local tribal baidays and tribal old man usually are the first to prescribe medicines for various remedies when illness strikes. Regarding the common diseases the respondents informed about the frequent occurrence of skin infection with other diseases like dysentery, diarrhea and snakebite. Knowlegde for Global Development 138 Figure -1: MAP OF Mayurbhanj District showing Similipal Biosphere Reserve Knowledge on types of diarrheal disease among the tribes of Mayurbahanj The most common type of diarrhea among the villagers was the green color and rice water diarrhea. All these diarrheal diseases mostly are induced by bacteria. The green color occurs because of un -processed green bile secretions from the upper small intestines which normally turn brown during transit. The black color results from blood that is acidified, as in the acidic environment of the upper small intestine Knowlegde for Global Development 139 (Navaneethan and Giannella, 2011). The tribals also have also knowledge on bloody diarrhea. Most cases of bacillary dysentery, caused by Shigella species, lead to blood in the stool as bacteria lyse and kill the epithelial lining of the intestines (Fernandez and Sansonetti, 2003). Watery diarrhea can be caused by too many salts or fats in the colon. Watery d iarrhea is caused by bacterial infection releasing toxin by E. coli , Mayurbhanj district, phytotherapy (treatment with medicines from plant and their derived products) forms an integral part of the local culture, and the information about plants and their uses are passed from generation to generation through oral folk -lore, primarily amongst the elderly; the natural retainers of traditional knowledge in their respective communities. The field study was carried out from September 2006 to November 2008, and the information on the use of medicinal plants for treatment of diarrhea was obtained through structured questionnaires, complemented by free interviews and in formal conversations (Huntington, 2000). The interviews were individually carried out during the first contacts with the local population, native specialists were identified, i.e. people considered by the community as having exceptional knowledge about the use of plants. Collection of medicinal plants The present work is based on the explorations made in Similipal Biosphere Reserve during 2006 -10. Field trips to Similipal Biosphere Reserve were undertaken for collection of medicinal plants. Identification of these medicinal plants was done at the Post Graduate Department of Botany, North Orissa University, Baripada. Processing Stems, leaves, bulb, barks, roots, rhizomes, seeds etc. of plants have separately been collected during field trips to different parts of Similipal Biosphere Reserve. The roots are dug out from the soil and the adhering soils were removed by shaking and washing. The leaves were plucked from the trees, washed properly and infected leaves were discarded. After collection, the healthy leaves were dried at low temperature to maintain their green color and volatile oils, if present. The materials were completely shed dried so long it does not allow for the growth of any type of fungi, molds, bacteria and other microorganisms. The dried le aves, roots and stems were powdered separately using mortar and pestle and then were passed through sieve to get the uniform powdered sample. Preparation of plant extracts Twenty grams of each powdered samples were dissolved in 100ml of sterile distilled water and 80% methanol separately in wide mouth bottles. The aqueous samples were Knowlegde for Global Development 140 prepared by adding distilled water (steam for 30 minutes) and stored overnight. Similarly, methanol samples were incubated at room temperature for 48 hrs. The suspension was then filtered (Whatman No. 40) separately and made up to 100ml with respective solvent and utilized for studying their antimicrobial properties. Test bacteria Pathogenic bacteria under study were Escherchia coli , bacterial cultures were maintained on nutrient agar (NA) slants and stored at 4 C. Activation of the bacterial was carried out by streaking culture from the slants on to a Muller Hinton agar (MHA) plate and incubating overnight at 37 C. Single colony was picked up from each plate and transferred to nutrient broth, incubated for 1 da y at 37 C prior to the test. Antibiotics The following antibiotics sensitivity test disc (Hi media Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India) at the given concentration were used to determine antibiotic sensitivity profile of reference and Vancomycin -Vn (30 g). Sensitivity test Antibiogram was done by disc diffusion method (Bauer et al., 1966) with commonly used antibiotics. Antibiotic sensitivity was tested in MHA plates. The test microbes were removed from the slant aseptically with inoculating loops and transferred to separate test tubes containing 5.0ml of steril e distilled water. Inoculums added until the turbidity equaled 0.5 McFarland (108 CFU/ml). For each of the bacteria, one milliliter of the test tube suspension was added to 15 -20ml of nutrient agar and transferred to the agar plate (90 mm diameter). After cooling the inoculated agars at room temperature for 25 min, antibiotic sensitivity test discs were placed on the surface of solid agar. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C. The plates were examined thereafter, clear zones of inhibition formed around the dis cs were measured and antibiotic sensitivity was assayed from the diameter of the clear inhibition zones (in mm) (Figure -2). Knowlegde for Global Development 141 Figure -2: Antibiogram among strains Screening of antimicrobial properties by agar cup method The agar cup method was followed to study antibacterial activity of the extracts. Overnight Muller Hinton Broth culture of the test organisms were firmly seeded over the MHA plates. Wells of 6 mm diameter was punched over the agar plates using a sterile borer. The bottoms of the wells were sealed by pouring 50 -100 \u00b5l of molten MHA into the scooped out wells. 100 \u00b5l of extracts were poured into the wells. The water was allowed to evaporate and the plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 18 -24 hours. Presence of zone of clearance around the wells, confirmed the antibacterial activity of the extracts. RESULTS The antidiarrheal screening of 134 plants collected from Similipal Biosphere Reserve, Orissa, India was carried out by agar cup method. The selection of plants was based on ethnome dicinal uses reported earlier as well as freshly recorded data (Table -3). Two different solvents viz. methanolic (80%) and aqueous used for the preparation of crude extracts (Table -2). A total of 288 plants extract (Table -4) belonging to 66 families were tested for anti -diarrheal activity. Among the selected 136 plants, 100 species showed anti-bacterial activity against at least two or more test organisms. Two families with higher number of plants didnt show any activity belonged which showed anti -diarrheal activity against pathogens. Screeni ng results showed antibacterial activity with 107 methanol and 74 aqueous extracts against one or more test strains. Some of the active species have already been reported earlier to have antibacterial activity. The effects of few (Valsaraj et al. 1997) and was confirmed in this work. Similar results were Knowlegde for Global Development 142 described by several authors by adding plants such 1998, 1999; Jeevan Ram Prashantkumar et al., 2006; Parekh and Chanda 2008). Figure 3: Agar cup method showing zone of inhib ition DISCUSSION Diarrhea is known to be caused by several factors including the non infectious type of diarrhea such as metabolic diseases, food allergy and other organic causes. On the contrary, infectious diarrhea is a type of diarrhea which is caused by an infectious agent (bacteria, fungus, parasites and viruses) due to the invasion and colonization of the host tissue. Infectious diarrhea is characterized by an alteration in a normal bowel movement, an increase in the volume of water content, or frequ ency of stools, nausea, vomiting, cramps and/or abdominal discomfort (Sood and Pacheco 2002). Studies on pathogens responsible for acute diarrhea in developing countries, revealed that the contribution of Rotavirus (15 -25%), entrerotoxigenic E. coli (10-20%), Shigella species species (1 jejuni (10-15%) and enterohemorragic Shigella, V. cholerae are the major bacterial pathogens most often responsible for causing pandemic and epidemic infectious diarrheal disease in developing countries (Black et al. 1984).

Rhamnaceae Bk Dysentery Kar Wp -whole plant Knowlegde for Global Development 154 A total of 288 plants extract s (Table -2) belonging to 66 families were tested for anti - diarrheal activity. Among the selected 136 plants, 100 species showed anti -bacterial activity against at least two or more test organisms. Some of important families with anti-diarrheal activity ag antibacterial activity with 107 methanol and 74 aqueous extracts against one or more test strains. Solvent or the extraction agent used in the preparation of phytopharmaceuticals must be suitable for dissolving the important therapeutic drug constituents. In addition, solvents used should be easy to remove, ine rt, nontoxic, and not easily flammable. The aqueous extracts have commonly been used in preliminary studies. Methanol efficiently penetrates cell membranes, permitting the extraction of high amounts of endocellular components in contrast to the solvents wi th lower polarity. Such solvents are limited for extracting mostly extracellular material. Hence, methanol chiefly dissolves polar constituents together with medium and low polarity compounds extracted by co -solubilazation. So, the aqueous and methanolic ( 80%) extracts of different plant belonging to a wide range of families are selected for screening based on random sampling and observed ethnomedicinal uses.

However, the strain S. dysentria e showed least activity in compared to above referred strains. Nigella satavia (Ranunculaceae), used to treat numerous ailments including diarrhea and its essential oil has been shown to exhibit activity against Staphylococcus aureus , Salmonella , Shigella , V. cholerae , al. 2003) . Swertia corymbose shows antibacterial activity against a wide range of microorganisms, including ( E. coli , Salmonella sp., V. cholerae and Staphylococcus aureus ) that cause diarrhea. Vijaya et al. 1997 reported 10 Indian traditional dysentery and diarrhea showed high antibacterial activity. Me thanol and water extracts of a number of medicinal plants used to treat dysentery and diarrhea in the Democratic Republic of Congo showed activity against one or more enteropathogens, including Shigella , nga-Otshudi et al. 1999). Diehl et al. 2004 evaluated 60 traditionally used plants in human or veterinary medicine to treat worm infections (worms in general, round worms, Guinea worms, or flatworms), diarrhea, dysentery and abdominal pain. Modern scient ific evaluation of medicinal plants and herbs is concerned with validating the traditional use of plants as well as identifying the active components of extracts and preparations. With respect to traditional medicines used to treat diarrheal diseases, such medicines will continue to be used as long as there are communities with limited access to modern therapies. In future, it may be possible to supplement conventional ORS treatment with plant extracts resulting in complementary treatments that may lead to a reduction in the length of disease symptoms. CONCLUSIONS This study proves that use of plants for treatment of diarrhea and dysentery among the tribes of Similipal is still a major part of life and culture. The data collected show that majority of reme dies are taken orally in fresh form. The study concludes that the tribes are depending on traditional medicinal uses and modern health system is far away from them. It is necessary to acquire and proper documentation of the knowledge of the tribes of Simil ipal, Mayurbahnj. The result obtained in the present study point out that in their crude form bout 75 % have scientifically proved as medicinal uses with respect to the antibacterial properties against diarrhea causing bacteria. RECOMMENDATION Surely, th e evidence provided by this study will encourages further investigation in the expectation that alternative treatments for diarrheal diseases will be developed. Further Knowlegde for Global Development 166 study is required to isolate compounds from plants which have not been reported as antimicrobial potential.

Knowlegde for Global Development 178 CHAPTER EIGHT MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATES IN RELIABILITY OF TYPHOID FEVER DRUG IN THE RECOVERY OF TYPHOID FEVER PATIENTS AT AKUSE (A CASE STUDY AT THE AKUSE GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL) Eric Boahen Department of Statistics, F aculty of Mathematical Sciences, University For Development Studies -Tamale. Box 24 uds Navrongo - Ghana . ABSTRACT Typhoid fever is one of the top ten outpatient diseases that is recorded by the Akuse Government Hospital. Akuse is a big town located in the eastern region of Ghana. The Government Hospital located in the area recorded a continuous substantial increase in the number of typhoid fever cases. This substantial increase was partly attributed to the fact that the probability of an individual to be he aled of the disease was relatively low. As a result of this, a five staged clinical trial was conducted by the hospital to assess the probability of being cured after receiving treatments. This five staged clinical trial was used in the research to assess the survivability growth and reliability of the typhoid fever drugs administered. The research was carried out by first, obtaining the observed survival probabilities at each stage and then the maximum likelihood estimates and least squares estimates were found. The Newton -Raphson procedure was used in the calculation of the maximum likelihood estimates. An appropriate (1 -) 100 percent lower confidence limit was then constructed for each stage of the clinical trial. In clinical trials, patients response to treatment is classified as success or failure, therefore, the overall probability of success in the clinical trial was then assessed with the aid of smoothen constants. The study identified that the drugs administered had huge effect on the survival of an individual and it was therefore recommended that the Hospital creates an awareness program for the people of Akuse to know that treating typhoid the drugs used in the clinical trial helps in curing typhoid. Also, the Akuse Government Hospital in their end eavor to the increase the curing rate of typhoid fever in the township should encourage patients to take drugs prescribed to the patients well. INTRODUCTION Introduction The purpose of the study was to find out the reliability and growth in the healing process of typhoid fever at Akuse in the Lower Manya District. This chapter consists of Knowlegde for Global Development 179 background of the study, problem statement, purpose of the study, objectives, research questions, scope of the study and Limitations. Background of the study Akuse is a town located in the Eastern Region of Ghana off the Akosombo - Tema highway. Akuse is under the Lower Manya Constituency and is situated close to the Volta River. Akuse Government Hospital is located at the entrance of the town, opposite the Ghana Commerc ial Bank. The hospital serves people from other surrounding towns such as Somanya, Atua, Kpong among other smaller towns located closes to Akuse. Typhoid Fever also known as Enteric Fever can be a life - threatening febrile disease, caused by the bacteriu m Salmonella Typhi . According to the Centre for Disease and Control (CDC) an estimated 22 million cases of typhoid fever and 200 000 related deaths occur worldwide every year. Typhoid is common in most parts of the developing world. In Ghana, a study condu cted in 2010 has shown that typhoid fever ranks among the leading causes of outpatient illness accounting for 0.92% of hospital admissions. The disease is most common in developing countries of which Ghana is no exception contributing factors being poor s anitary system and lack of antibiotics putting travelers to Asia America and Africa in high risk group. Typhoid fever belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae and has been associated with gastroenteritis and food borne diseases. The salmonella species is the etiological agents of most food borne disease and gastroenteritis. In the year 2011, three hundred and twenty two cases (322) of typhoid fever were recorded in the Akuse Government Hospital with seven hundred and seventy two (772) cases and one thousa nd (1000) cases in 2012 and 2013 respectively.Domestically acquired typhoid fever, however, is often transmitted by chronic carrier of salmonella typhi. After recovering from typoid fever, some individuals carry the bacterium asymptomatically for long peri ods; others are asymptomatic carriers without ever having the disease. The silent carriers contribute to continued episodes of infection. Most of the disease is acquired by people travelling overseas (Prescott, 1999). The disease, typhoid fever, is cause d by Salmonella typhi which is acquired by ingestion of food or water contaminated by faeces of infected humans. The pathogen colonizes the small intestines penetrating the lymph node spleen and other lymphoid tissues within 6 -14 days after exposure, to he adache and fever developments. The latter can continue for weeks and rise about 40 Celsius. In most cases, salmonella typhi is Knowlegde for Global Development 180 shed in faeces for several weeks. However, approximately 3% of those who recover continue to shed salmonella typhi for extended periods but show no symptoms of the disease. In such individuals, termed carriers, the bacterium grows in the gall bladder and finds its way to the intestines through the bile duct. Typhoid fever is usually confirmed by identifying Salmonella Typhi in a culture of the blood or other body fluid (urine and stools). For the culture, a sma ll sample of the patients blood, urine and stool is placed in a container to growth the bacteria. This takes between 48 to 72 hours, for the culture to be checked under a microscope for the presence of the bacteria. According to CDC, one can get typhoid fever if food or drink beverages that have been handled by a person who is shedding Salmonella Typhi are ingested or if sewage contaminated with Salmonella Typhi bacteria gets into the water used for drinking or washing food. Therefore, typhoid fever is m ore common in areas of the world where hand washing is less frequent and water is likely to be contaminated with sewage. World Health Organization (WHO) also mentioned the mode of transmission of the disease as through the ingestion of food or drink conta minated by the faeces or urine of infected persons. Typhoid fever in Akuse is mostly attributed to the works of witchcraft and other demonic powers. The people of Akuse believe that the disease can be transmitted onto a person by spiritual means. In a blo g posted on March 10th, 2012 by one researcher named BiorKwerBiorJr (Borglobe), he mentions that the people of South Sudan and other neighboring countries have a myth that typhoid fever is attributed to the sun. Case -fatality rates of 10% can be reduced t o less than 1% with appropriate antibiotic therapy. However, strains resistant to chloramphenicol and other recommended antibiotics (ampicillin, cotrimoxazole and even ciprofloxacin) have become prevalent in several areas of the world. It usually takes two weeks for patients treating typhoid fever to be fully cured. Typhoid fever can also be treated herbally using the roots, bark and leaves of plants. The use of mauringa is highly recognized in Akuse for the treatment of typhoid fever and other fever relat ed diseases. CDC described measures of preventing the disease in four ways; boil it, cook it, peel it or forget it. The Centre for Disease Control listed these measures of preventing or avoiding typhoid; Knowlegde for Global Development 181 If you drink water, buy it bottled or bring it to a rolling boil for 1 minute before you drink it. Bottled carbonated water is safer than uncarbonated water. Ask for drinks without ice unless the ice is made from bottled or boiled water. Avoid popsicles and flavored ices that may have been made with conta minated water. Eat foods that have been thoroughly cooked and that are still hot and steaming. Avoid raw vegetables and fruits that cannot be peeled. Vegetables like lettuce are easily contaminated and are very hard to wash well. When you eat raw fruit or vegetables that can be peeled, peel them yourself. (Wash your hands with soap first). Do not eat the peelings. The following problems are faced in the treatment process of typhoid fever; Patients do not take medications as prescribed by the doctor or heal th practitioner. Patients do not heed to the doctors advice by not returning for a checkup after two weeks when the bacteria and the symptoms are expected to have gone. Some patients feel reluctant to report signs and symptoms early but rather wait till the symptoms become severe before seeking medical attention Problem Statement Typhoid fever is one of the leading causes of death among children and adults in Ghana. Study has shown that, EasternRegion has high cases of typhoid. Our study has also shown t hat, Eastern Region is one of the regions with high typhoid cases due to the open defecation practice, dirty surroundings and unhygienic practices. Typhoid fever is one of the top 10 out -patient diseases in Ghana according to the Ghana health service. It is rated among the top killer diseases in Ghana. Typhoid fever cases in Akuse are on the rise. The typhoid fever cases at Akuse in the eastern region for the year 2011, 2012 and 2013 are three hundred and twenty two (322), seven hundred and seventy two (77 2) and one thousand (1000) respectively and the recovery rate for the patients have been low. There is a situation at Akuse where infected persons who report to the hospital, diagnosed with the disease, given medication to follow and are asked to come back for review end up, taking the medication until when the infected person feels his situation is better but not when the dosage of the medication has been fully completed. The infected persons also ignore the review instruction set by the doctor or health practitioner. Therefore, the fact that, an infected person is fully cured of the disease and Knowlegde for Global Development 182 the bacteria have been removed from the system is in doubt. These patients will still harbor the bacteria in their bodies. When these infected persons have a bowel movement, they may pass stools (faeces) that contain the Salmonella typhi bacteria. There is a low l evel of sanitation at Akuse and hygienic conditions are also poor. Infected persons, who do not wash their hands before handling food and water, contaminat e the food. When another person consumes tainted food or water, he picks up the typhoid bacteria and become infected. Some people, known as chronic carriers, still harbor typhoid bacteria (and can still contaminate food and water supplies) even after rec eiving antibiotic treatment and proving to be free of symptoms. All these conditions add up to the increasing rate of typhoid cases at Akuse. In this regard, the research was interested in studying the survivability growth and the reliability of typhoid fever drugs at Akuse in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Purpose of the study The purpose of the study is to: Assess the survivability growth rate of the healing process Assess the reliability of the drug Objectives of the study The main objectives of the st udy are to assess the reliability of the drug and growth in the healing process of typhoid fever and also to determine the overall probability of success or failure in each stage of the clinical trial. Research Questions These research questions have been outlined for the project. How reliable is the drug? Is the healing process improving? Is the overall survival probability at each stage of the clinical trial good? Scope of the study The study is confined to the Lower Manya District of the Eastern Region , Akuse to be precise. The data used for the project was collected in five stages with ten patients in each stage. The conclusion of the study was however generalized and made applicable to all typhoid cases treated with cefuroxime and ciprofloaxin through out the country. The study was not made applicable to other drugs used in the treatment of typhoid fever. Knowlegde for Global Development 183 Limitations of the Study These constraints among others were encountered during the study; Those in charge of the data were reluctant to give out the data for analysis. It was difficult for those at the records department to really understand the kind of data needed for the research. It was not easy moving from Navrongo to Akuse to collect the data as far as monetary issues are concerned. METHODOLOGY Introduction This chapter introduces the methodology adopted in the study. It discusses the study area, the design of the research, sample size selection, population of study, technique used in the data collection, sampling techniques, statistical analysis, and procedures and describes the theory of the model used, formulations and methods of analyzing the available data to satisfy the objectives of the study. Study area The study was conducted among typhoid fever patients in the Akuse Government Hospital. The hospital is one of the biggest in the ManyaKrobo District and also one of the oldest in the country. The Akuse Government hospital is located at the entrance of the Akuse town, opposite the Ghana Commercial Bank. It serves people from neighboring towns and villages. The people of Akuse are mainly farmers and petty traders. Some of the indigenes are employed with the anana farm plantation located close to the town. The Kpong Generation Station, with four power turbines, which produces power for the natio nal grid is also located at Akuse. Therefore, Akuse also inhabits the Volta River Authority (VRA) workers, who work in the generation station. Population and sample The population of the study was made up of typhoid fever patients in the ManyaKrobo distr ict. However, the accessible population of the research consisted of all typhoid fever patients who were diagnosed with the disease in the month of October. A total number of 63 cases was recorded by the hospital for that month. Sources of data collected Secondary data was our main source of collecting data for the study. The secondary data was collected from the hospital in a clinical trial conducted in five stages. The trial was to test the survivability growth of patients remission from typhoid fever. The trial had each in each stage ten patients who were receiving treatment from typhoid. Each patient had a healing period of two weeks since the typhoid fever drugs used are supposed to cure a patient with the disease within that period. Each stage of th e clinical trial has a new group of patients thereby making the trial carried out, independent. Knowlegde for Global Development 184 Statistical analysis, procedures and models used The data collected was a research conducted in 5 (five) stages such that at the ithstage nipatients enter the study each with a probability of surviving the ith stage.

After the ith stage, the probability there are xisurvivors (number of patients healed ) is * + . / ( ) ...(1) Some general parametric growth models is assumed by for measuring survivability growth from stage to stage.

The exponential model is given by ( ) ...(2) where are the parameters of the model, . Two methods commonly used to estimate and are least squares and maximum likelihood. Maximum likelihood estimators are gen erally preferred to least squares estimators because of the desirability of large sample properties of maximum likelihood estimator.

Models developed have been concerned in estimating the probability of success (failure) at eac h stage for clinical trials conducted in stages. We are to assess the overall probability of success at the end of each stage of the clinical trial conducted in stages. At the first stage of the trial, the estimate for patient response is given by (33) Where, = patients under stage , = patients are those who respond for stage , The overall assessed probability of patient response after each stage the model is Knowlegde for Global Development 189 . / (34) Where, proportion of patient respond at the is the smoothing constants of each stage Using the empirical approach or method discussed by Gross [1971b] in determining the smoothing constant, we make the following assumptions, is an unbiased estimator of , where is the theoretical assessment of the overall probabil ity of success after the trial, ( ), thus is the probability that a patient on study during the stage responds. All patients within a stage have the same independent probability of response. Furthermore, th e stages are independent. The criterion for the choice of each smoothing constant is to minimise the variance of its associated value by assumption 1 through 3. (35) ( ) (36) Hence ( ) (37) = inverse estimated variance for each stage = smoothing constant for each stage RESULTS AND DIS CUSSION Introduction This chapter presents the details of the analysis and results of the research. This consists of presentation of data collected, numerical analysis (least square estimates and maximum likelihood estimates), confidence region and interva l at each five stages of the of the clinical trial, assessment of the overall probability of success in the clinical trial and discussion of the results. Presentation of data collected Analysis on this study began with the data collected from the Akuse Go vernment Hospital. The data collected was a clinical trial which was conducted in five (5) stages. The clinical trial was conducted with the aim of improving the probability that patients suffering from typhoid fever will be cured after receiving treatment . The data, which was made up of ten patients in each stage of the clinical trial adding up to fifty (50) Knowlegde for Global Development 190 patients. Out of the fifty patients, twenty two (22) were male and twenty eight (28) were females. The five staged clinical trial, has in each stage a total of ten patients who underwent the trials. In each stage of the clinical trial some of patients were unable to be cured of the disease, others did. The patients, who after two weeks, are supposed to be cured of the disease, were grouped into healed and not healed. That is, those patients that were cured of the disease were grouped under healed and those that were not cured, placed under not healed. Stage one of the clinical trial had six patients healed and four patients not healed. Stage two and sta ge three had seven patients healed and three patients not healed each. Stage four had eight patients being healed and two patients not healed. Stage five had nine patients out of ten healed. The proportion of patients being cured at each stage of the clin ical trial is derived. This is done by dividing the total number of patients that were healed in the stage by the total number of patients in that stage of the clinical trial. This proportion of patients also depicts the survival probabilities of each stag e. The table below shows the details of the data collected. Table 1: Stage by stage clinical trial with survival probability of each stage Stages Total number of patients Number of males Number of females Number of patients healed Number of patients not healed Survival probability 1 10 4 6 6 4 0.6 2 10 3 7 7 3 0.7 3 10 5 5 7 3 0.7 4 10 6 4 8 2 0.8 10 4 6 9 1 0.9 Table 1 shows an improvement in the number of patients that are healed from stage -to- stage. Plotting the survival probabi lities of each stage aids in determining the exponential model used in the analysis of the data. The graph in Fig 2 shows the graphical display of the survival probabilities. Knowlegde for Global Development 191 Fig 2: Graph of Survival probabilities as a function of the stages (i) for ty phoid fever remission X-axis = stages , Y-axis = survival probabilities Fig 2 shows the survival probabilities having a slower growth in the early stages which sustains itself in the later stages. This determines the use of the exponential model in the analysis of the data. The exponential model is used when at the early stages of the clinical trial the survival probabilities show a slow growth and later sustains itself. Numerical analysis Two methods are commonly used in the estimation of and . These are the maximum likelihood and least squares. Maximum likelihood estimators are generally preferred to least squares estimators because of the desirability of the large sample properties of maximum likelihood estimators. On the other hand, least s quare estimators are often obtainable in closed form and are good first approximation. Least square estimates The exponential model as given in equation (1 9), computes and , the maximum likelihood estimates of and respectively, where = the growth in the healing process (survivability growth) = the drug intervention (reliability of the typhoid drugs) To this end, we obtained the i nitial estimates and by least square equations (1 7) and ( 18). The estimates and were obtained from the layout in Table 2. 00.20.40.60.811.2 0 1 2 3 4 5 6Survival Probabilities Stage Number Knowlegde for Global Development 192 Table 2: Least square computation layout Stages Number of cured patients 1 6 4/11 From T able 2 and equations (17) and (1 8), it follows that our initial estimates was 0.55480 and was 0.317805. These initial estimates are our least square estimates. Maximum likelihood estimates The initial estimates were used in the computation for the Newton -Raphson procedure. This procedure was used to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of and . By the Newton -Raphson procedure, the maximum likelihood estimates was obtained by going through series of iterations f or the Newton -Raphson procedure to converge at an estimate. To facilitate the computation of the Newt on-Raphson procedure, Table 3 is given. In this table we let , , , ) , ( ) - For the first iteration we used the initial estimates in the computation.

The iteration was stopped since the Newton -Raphson procedure converged to the maximu m likelihood estimates. Table 7 shows the results at each step of the iteration. The third iteration was chosen since further iterations gave the requisite maximum likelihood estimates and does not change the result.

It is intrusive to compare the observed and expected relief probabilities at each stage using both least squares and maximum likelihood estimate s. These comparisons appear in Table 4.10. Table 8: Expected and observed relief probabilitie s for typhoid fever patients at each stage when the clinical trial is conducted Stages Observed Probability Expected Maximum Likelihood Estimate probability Expected Least Squares likelihood Estimate probability 1 0.6 0.5851647 0.5962472 2 0.7 0.6835448 0.7061711 3 0.8158443 0.8443846 5 0.9 0.8595177 0.8867517 Table 8 indicates the growth in survivability at each stage of the clinical trial. The table also indicates that the least square estimates tend to overestimate and the maximum Knowlegde for Global Development 197 likelihood estimates tend to underestimate the observed probabilities of relief at each stage. Thus the least square estimates are somewhat optimistic whereas the maximum likelihood estimates are somewhat conservative. Confidence region and interval for the probability of relief We obtained an appropriate (1 -) 100 percent lower confidence limit ( ) for the model by means of ( 25). Thus the values of and was obtained by inverting the matrix of as by equations ( 27), (28) and ( 29), respectively. Thus, using the maximum likelihood estimates, we found , and .

SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION Summary Typhoid fever is one of the top 10 out -patient diseases in Ghana according to the Ghana health service.It is rated among the top killer diseases in Ghana. The research began with information gathered from the Akuse Government Hospital depicting a rise in the number of typhoid fever cases recorded from 2011, 2012 to 2013. The figures recorded by the hospital were 322, 772 and 1000. These indicate an increase from year to year. The increase was amounted to the fact that the residents in the Akuse Township had bad hygienic practices which has contributed to the sprea d of the disease in the vicinity. Stage 1 0.6 37.5 - 0.600 2 0.7 42.86 0.533 0.778 Knowlegde for Global Development 199 In this regard, the research was interested in assessing the survivability growth and reliability of typhoid fever drugs in Akuse. The main objectives of the research was to assess the survivability growth and reliability of typhoid fever drugs and also the overall probability of survival in each stage of the clinical trial conducted by the hospital. The methodology employed to assess the survivability growth was to find least squares and maximum likelihood estimates of th e exponential model chosen to analyze the data collected from the hospital. The exponential model was chosen after the data collected from the hospital was plotted on a graph. The graph showed a slow survivability growth in the early stages which sustained itself in the later stages of the clinical trial. The maxim um likelihood estimates and the least squares estimates was used to find expected maximum likelihood estimate probabilities and expected maximum likelihood probability estimates, respectively, which was compared with the observed probability estimates. The confidence interval and region for the probability of relief at each stage was also calculated. The overall probability of success at each stage of the clinical trial was calculated for by finding the inverse estimated variance and smoothing constants for each stage. These in turn aid in assessing the overall probability of success in each stage of the clinical trial. The Least squares estimates were found to be the initial estimates of the maximum likelihood estimates. These initial estimates was 0.55480 and was 0.317805. The initial estimates was used in the computation for the Newton -Raphson procedure for the calculation of the maximum likelihood estimates. By the Newton -Raphson procedure, the maximum likelihood estimates was obtained by going through series of iterations for the Newton -Raphson procedure to converge at an estimate. After the second iteration, the Newton -Raphson procedure converged at and . The third iteration was chosen since further ite rations gave the requisite maximum likelihood estimates and does not change the result. The observed and expected relief probabilities at each stage using both least squares and maximum likelihood estimates was compared. A 95 percent lower confidence limi t for ( ), , noting that 1.645 is the upper 95th percentage point of the standard normal distribution was constructed. Each stage with its lower limit was found to be 1=0.3340049, 2=0.5299582, 3=0.6604890, with confidence 0.95 was also calculated for. Knowlegde for Global Development 200 Finally, in finding the assessed overall probability of success, the smoothing constants were calculated for and was used in assessing the o verall probability of success. The overall remission probabilities for stage 1 through to five were 0.600, 0.653, 0.669, 0.710 and 0.778, respectively. CONCLUSION From the analysis made and estimates derived in the Newton -Raphson procedure, we conclude th at since , the drug is reliable and very useful in the healing process of typhoid fever. On whether the healing process is improving, conclusion was made on the observed survival probabilities derived from the data collected from the hospital. The observe d probabilities showed an increase in the number of survivors at each stage of the clinical trial. This depicts improvement in the healing process. This is further confirmed by the expected least squares estimates probabilities and maximum likelihood estim ates probabilities derived for each stage which show increasing probabilities from stage to stage. Noting that is a function of and , and also since is increasing that is, the drug reliability increase from stage to stage, this in turn affects the survivability growth and hence we conclude that there is improvement in the healing process. Considering the probability values derived in the assessed overall survival probabilities, we conclude that a patient that faces treatment in stage one will have a 0.6 chance of survival, whereas stages two and three have 0.653 and 0.669 chances of surviv al respectively. Stages four and five had their overall survival probabilities to be above 0.7 and hence a patient chance of being cured of typhoid fever in that stage is 0.7 which is a very high chance of success. RECOMMENDATION From the conclusions the seare the recommendations we came out with. It is obvious that typhoid fever has very high chances of being cured and hence people affected with the disease are advised to visit the hospital to seek treatment. The Akuse Government Hospital in their endeavo r to increase the curing rate of typhoid fever in the township should encourage patients to take drugs prescribed to them. The Ghana Health Service should engage in more clinical trials to improve upon the overall survival probabilities of patients Future assessments and or researchers are encouraged to collect primary data for their research.
