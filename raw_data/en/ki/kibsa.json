Fresh, clean drinking water and good quality hay and grass should make up the majority of your rabbits' diet. A rabbit's digestive system needs hay or grass to function properly so a healthy supply is extremely important. You can supplement with leafy greens and a small amount of pellets. Root vegetables such as carrots or fruit, should only be given in small portions as a treat, as rabbits don't naturally eat these type of foods. Always avoid muesli-style food, as these are unhealthy for rabbits and has a number of associated health problems. Rabbits need: - Fresh clean drinking water continuously, checked twice daily. Ensure water doesn't freeze in winter.
