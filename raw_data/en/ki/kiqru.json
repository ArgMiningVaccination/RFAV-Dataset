Research on healthcare trends show that people desire a less invasive, more natural approach to health. Patients want the time and the space to discuss their individual needs and goals during an appointment with their doctor. Collaboration between practitioner and patient is essential to this new model of healthcare, and naturopathic medicine has emerged as the healthcare system best suited to meet the demands of the modern patient. Naturopathic medicine is different than conventional medicine in that it always looks to treat the underlying cause of imbalance. For instance, within the conventional medical model, pharmaceuticals are designed to control symptoms. Antacids can be given for heartburn or laxatives can be prescribed for constipation. These medications are, without a doubt, immensely valuable. They can save lives, and they serve an important purpose in modern healthcare. However, though taking a pill can lesson a symptom, the underlying issue that caused the symptom is often left unaddressed. When symptoms are covered up with medication the condition is simply masked and the body's cry for help is ignored. Over time this can cause symptoms of imbalance in other areas of the body. Naturopathic doctors understand that symptoms can be uncomfortable, and in worse case scenarios, life threatening. Naturopathic doctors are versed in the appropriate use of conventional and alternative methods to facilitate the body's innate healing response - they are fully able to provide palliative support to ensure a safe and comfortable journey to greater health. Put simply, what sets naturopathy apart is that the practitioner is always looking to take health beyond symptom management. A well-trained and experienced naturopath will consider all factors that influence health, including mind, body, spirit, and community. When needed, she can order and interpret screening blood work and specialized tests. With her expansive knowledge of clinical nutrition, Chinese or Western botanicals, homeopathy, hydrotherapy, acupuncture, nutritional supplements, and lifestyle counseling, a naturopath will help you reach and sustain your personal health goals.
