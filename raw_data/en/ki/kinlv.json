Knowing what the weather will likely be for the next few hours and the next several days has opened up incredible opportunities for society as a whole\u2014for individual s making decisions about what th ey will do in their daily lives, for industry planning and risk management, and for governments making critical life and property protect ion decisions. What if there were similar use of forecasts fo r two weeks, three week s, or even three or six months from now? It is easy to envision the potential value of high- quality predictions two weeks to 12 months ahead for any number of industries\u2014for example, energy, water resource management, and agriculture. There are undoubtedly potential benefits to ot her sectors that we cannot even imagine today. Even if such inform ation never matches the level of confidence associated with tomorrow's weather forecast, it could still be used by individuals, businesses, and governments to plan and ma ke a large array of important decisions. In this study, our Committee puts forward a vision that subseasonal to seasonal forecasts (S2S)\u2014i.e., forecasts of environmental conditions made approximately two weeks to twelve months in advance\u2014will be as widely used a decade from now as weather fo recasts are today. The pa th to realizing this vision and its inherent value will require focused effort on S2S processes and predictions by both physical and social scientists. Today, this type of commitment largely ex ists on both the weather timescale and on the scales in which climate chan ge is expected. S2S falls in a \"gap\" between these two areas, and in general, has not received the same level of dedicated effort and support. This report presents research strategies for de aling with this \"in-be tween\" space over the next decade. Although the overall quality and use of produc ts in the S2S time frame have been growing over the past decade, increasing the predic tive skill of coupled Earth system models in S2S forecast ranges will be essential to increasin g the benefits and expanding the number of end users of these products. The benef its of S2S forecasts will be furt her enhanced if the scope of operational S2S forecasts were extended beyond th e traditional weather variables to include more Earth system variables and events. Oppor tunities for improvements and expansions to existing forecasts include, for example, enhanced predictions of the ocean state, sea ice fields, aerosols and air quality, and water management. A focus on developing better information on the likelihood of specific and disruptiv e environmental events, in addi tion to improving the skill of currently available forecasts of temperature and precipitation anomalies, has great potential to further enhance the value of S2S predictions. This report presents a resear ch agenda that provides the framework for the physical and social science communities to collaboratively advance the skil l, breadth and value of S2S predictions. Our Committee held five in-per son meetings between October 2014 and May 2015, and received broad and diverse i nput from experts in both physical and social science as well as from end users of S2S forecasts. We would like to thank all of those who provided their time and insight. The contributors are li sted in the Acknowledgments s ection above.

How much power should an el ectric utility plan to produce in order to meet demand for air conditioning during a summer week? Is a weather-sensi tive military sortie likely to be effective on a particular afternoon? Making th ese and myriad other decisions ac ross virtually all sectors of the economy has been transformed by the availability of skillful forecasts with lead times of a few hours to a few days. The value and importance of weather and other e nvironmental forecasts will increase as the nation's econom ic activities, security concer ns, and stewardship of natural resources become increasingly complex, globally interrelated, and a ffected by longer-term climate changes. While short-term forecasts already play a vi tal role in shaping societal decision-making, many critical decisions must be made several weeks to months in advance of potentially favorable or disruptive environm ental conditions. For example, it can take weeks or months to move emergency and disaster-relie f supplies, but pre-staging resour ces to areas that are likely to experience extreme weather or an infectious di sease outbreak could save lives and stretch the efficacy of limited resources. Similarly, emergenc y managers responding to unanticipated events such as nuclear power plant accidents or larg e oil spills face the task of communicating the ramifications of such events on timescales th at stretch well beyond a few days. There are many more such examples: naval and commercial ship ping planners designate shipping routes weeks in advance, seeking to stage a ssets strategically, avoid hazard s, and/or take advantage of favorable conditions; with improved knowledge of the likelihood of pr ecipitation or drought, farmers can purchase seed varieties that are most likely to increase yields and reduce costs; and depending on the year, water resource managers can face a multitude of decisions about reservoir levels in the weeks, months, and seasons ahead of eventual water consumption. A frontier in forecasting involves extending the capability to skillfully predict environmental conditions and disrup tive weather events to several weeks and months in advance, filling what has long been a gap between today' s short-term weather and ocean forecasting capabilities (within the next 14 days) and a growi ng ability to project th e longer-term climate (on scales of years to decades or more). Seasona l\u2014and more recently s ubseasonal\u2014predictions (defined in Box S.1) have improved over the last decade, but there is great opportunity to further improve the skill of S2S forecasts, as well as th e breadth of forecasted variables and routinely available forecast products. Doing so could dr amatically increase the benefits of the environmental prediction enterprise: saving li ves, protecting propert y, increasing economic vitality, protecting the environment, and informing policy choices. Despite their large potential, Earth syst em predictions on subseasonal to seasonal timescales remain challenging for researchers, mo delers, and forecasters. While it is increasingly recognized that many sources of predictability exist in the Earth system on S2S timescales, representing these sources of predictability in Earth system models is challenging. Models must adequately capture the initial states of the atmosphere, ocean, land surface and cryosphere, as well as the interactions, or coupl ing, of these different components . Furthermore, the longer lead times associated with S2S predictions make the re presentation of uncertainty and the verification process more challenging and more computa tionally intensive than numerical weather Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Subseasonal forecasts often project average conditions over a week or more, often with lead times of 2-6 weeks or more. In this report, \"subseasonal to seasonal\" or \"S 2S\" includes environmental predictions with forecast ranges from 2 weeks to 12 months (see also Box 1.1). prediction. Nonetheless, potential advances both in technology\u2014satellites, computing, etc.\u2014and in science\u2014model parameterizatio ns, data assimilation techniques, etc.\u2014make advances in S2S forecasting feasible within the next decade. Another key challenge is making S2S forecasts more applicable to users. S2S forecasts are generally less skillful than shorter-term predic tions, are issued at lower spatial and temporal resolutions, and may involve the communication of probabilistic information that is unfamiliar to many users. These barriers have the potentia l to be overcome thr ough research about and engagement with users. Given the opportunities associated with improved S2S forecasts, but also the many challenges associated with developing them, th e Office of Naval Research (ONR), the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA), and the Heising-Simons Foundation asked the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medi cine to undertake a study to develop a 10-year U.S. research agenda to increase S2S resear ch and modeling capability, advance S2S forecasting, and aid in decision making at medium and exte nded lead times (see Appendix A for the study's Statement of Task). The Academies convened the Committee on Developing a U.S. Research Agenda to Advance Subseasonal to Seasona l Forecasting to meet this request. VISION AND RESEARCH STRA TEGIES FOR THE NEXT DECADE The Committee believes that ther e is great potential to advance S2S forecasting capability and rapidly increase the benefits of S2S pred ictions to many sectors in society. However, overcoming the challenges to developing S2S forecasting will take sustained effort and investment. Encouraged by its sponsors to be bold, the Committee puts forward a vision that S2S forecasts will be as widely used a decade from now as weather forecasts are today and identifies four research strategies and 16 reco mmendations to guide progr ess towards that vision. The research strategies for improving the use of S2 S forecasts in the next decade (see Figure S.1) are: 1. Engage Users in the Process of Developing S2S Forecast Products 2. Increase S2S Forecast Skill 3. Improve Prediction of Extreme and Disruptive Events and Consequences of Unanticipated Forcing Events 4.

The Committee's recommendations collectively constitute an S2S research agenda for the nation. Given the fluid technological, pol itical, and financial environment in which the research agenda will be implemented, the Commi ttee decided it was more important to identify the most important areas where progress can be made without overly pres cribing the sequence or priority in which they should be addressed. Wh ile most recommendations support more than one research strategy, they are described in the fo llowing sections under the primary strategy with which they are associated. To help agencies and others within the weathe r/climate enterprise se lect specific parts of the research agenda to pursue , Table S.1 and Table 8.1 in the report provide additional detail about the recommendations: whether they involve ba sic or applied research; which are expected to have short-term benefits; which might require a new initiative; and which have a scope that calls for international collaboration. The chapte rs contain additional recommended activities that fall under each main recommendation, which add furt her specificity and brea dth to the research agenda. While it might not be possible to pursu e all of these actions simultaneously, the more that is done to implement these recommendations, the more advances in S2S forecasting can be made. Research Strategy 1: Engage Users in the Pro cess of Developing S2S Forecast Products Many barriers hinder the use of existing S2 S forecast information, including increasing demand for a wider variety of forecast variables and formats that are not readily available. An important first step in providing more actionabl e S2S forecast information is to develop a body of social and behavioral scien ce research that leads to more comprehensive understanding of the current use and barriers to use of S2S pred ictions (Recommendation A). This will involve research to uncover the specific aspects of produ cts\u2014forecast variables, spatial and temporal resolutions, necessary leve ls of skill, etc.\u2014that make S2S products more useful to decision- makers across multiple sectors. Beyond such assessments, engaging the S2 S research and operational prediction community in an iterative dialogue with user communities is necessary to help ensure that forecast systems, forecast products , and other model output, are designed from the outset to be useful for decision making (Recommendation B). O ngoing efforts will be needed to match what is scientifically predictable and technological feasible at S2S timescales with what users find actionable, as both scientific skill and user n eeds continually evolve. La unching such a dialogue requires bringing decision makers into the research and developm ent process sooner rather than later. Private industry and 'bounda ry organizations' within academi a and the public sector (such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency 's [NOAA] Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments program and the International Rese arch Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University, and many others) have al ready started such discussions. Leveraging the entire weather and climate enterprise\u2014not just the public sector\u2014will be necessary for further developing such an iterative approach to th e development of S2S products and services.

Improving the skill of S2S forecasts is fundamental to increasing thei r value to society. Enhancing skill begins with understanding sources of and limits to S2S pred ictability within the Earth system. Current research indicates that a large portion of S2S predictability originates from: Natural modes of variability (e.g., Southern Oscillation [ENSO], the Oscillation Box 1.3); Slowly-varying processes (e.g., involving soil mo isture, snow pack and other aspects of the land surface, ocean heat content, curre nts and eddy positions, and sea ice); and Elements of external forcing (e.g., aerosols , greenhouse gasses) that can result in a systematic and predictable e volution of the Earth system. Basic research on these phenomena and their in teractions is fundamental to identifying and understanding the processes that must be in cluded in Earth system models in order to increase S2S forecast skill (Recommendation C). In addition to extending knowledge about sour ces of S2S predictability, efforts are needed across every part of the forecast sy stem, including improved observations and data assimilation methods, advances in Earth system models, and improved me thods for uncertainty quantification, calibrati on, and verification. Observations Routine observations are essential for accurate ly initializing models, validating model output, and improving understanding of the physical system and its predictability. The ocean, land surface, and cryosphere remain significantly under-observed compared to the atmosphere, despite being major sources of S2 S predictability. Maintaining and in some cases bolstering the network of observations across all components of the Earth system is critical to advancing S2S prediction skill (Recommendation E). While it would be beneficial to expand the geographic coverage and resolution of many types of observations, cost and logistics will cont inue to demand an identification of the most critical priorities. Observing system simula tion experiments (OSSEs) and other sensitivity studies are powerful tools for exploring the impor tance of specific observations on estimation of the state of the Earth system and overall mode l performance, and could be better used to prioritize improvements to observation networks for S2S prediction systems (Recommendation F). Data Assimilation Data assimilation is the pro cess of initializing and updating Earth system models with observations, and is also important for uncertain ty quantification, calibra tion, and validation of forecasts.

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 6 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY system model presents many challenges, including ensuring that initializations are dynamically consistent and that they minimize the growth of errors. Given that coupling between the multiple, dynamic components of the Earth system (e.g., atmosphere, ocean, ice, land) is central to S2S prediction, developing and implemen ting coupled data assimilation me thods is at the forefront of S2S model development. \"Weakly-coupled\" data assimilation is one existing method that is increasingly implemented in weather predic tion, and also holds promise for improving S2S prediction systems. \"Strongly-coupled\" data assimilation allows observations within one component of the Earth system to affect state es timates in other components (with constraints). This technique is still in its infancy but has the potential to spur a more dramatic leap forward. Realizing the method's potential w ill require significant research and testing that should be explored while continuing to pursue weak ly-coupled methods (Recommendation G). Models Systematic errors are numerous within the Earth system models used for S2S forecasting\u2014many global models produce an unr ealistically strong Pacific equatorial cold tongue, a spurious double Inter Tropi cal Convergence Zone (ITCZ), wet or dry biases in rainfall in many parts of the world, among other issues. Thes e model errors can be large compared to the predictable signals targeted by S2S forecasts. Th us taking steps to reduce systematic errors within coupled Earth system mode ls is one of the most important steps in improving the skill of S2S predictions. Modest increases in model resolutions hold potential for reducing model errors and such improvements should continue to be studied. However, given the co mputational costs of increasing model resolution, many critical Ea rth system processes will need to be parameterized\u2014i.e., represented using simplified physics schemes rather th an being explicitly resolved in models\u2014for the foreseeable future . Thus improving physical parameterizations will remain fundamental to reducing model errors and increasing S2S forecast skill, even as the capability to resolve more and more processes expands (Recommendation H). Coordinated, coupled field campaigns, process-targeted sa tellite missions, and long-term collaborations between research and operati onal scientists are essential for developing the understanding required to improve models a nd model parameterizations. Calibration, Combination, Verificati on, and Optimization of S2S forecasts Some model errors will remain even with major improvements in models and increased resolution. Using multi-model ensembles (MMEs) is likely to remain critical for S2S prediction as one of the most promising ways to account fo r errors associated w ith Earth system model formulation. However, current MMEs are largel y systems of opportunity (i.e., basing the MME design on expediency). Research is required to more systema tically develop MME forecast systems. Careful optimization of the configur ations of a multi-model prediction system will include systematic exploration of the benefits and costs of addi ng unique models to an MME and evaluation of other S2S forecast system design elements (\"trade space\"), including calibration methods, model resolution, number of ensemble me mbers, averaging period, lengths of lead and retrospective forecasts, and options for coupled sub-models (Recommendation K).

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Summary 7 PREPUBLICATION COPY trade space will be a complicated and expensiv e endeavor, but determining how performance depends on system configuration is a ke y task in the S2S research agenda. Verification metrics are impor tant for tracking and comparing model improvements, and are also a critical part of building user trus t in S2S forecasts. Improving verification should be done in collaboration with user groups, along wi th research on feature-based and two-step verification methods and consideration of how the design of retrospective forecasts and reanalyses can influence the abilit y of some users to directly eval uate the consequences of acting on forecasts at various predicted probabilities (Recommendation J). Moving research to operations Finally, transitioning new ideas, tools, and other technology between the S2S research community and operational cen ters is challenging but essential to translating research discoveries into better informed decision-making. The use of MMEs in research settings, for example the North American Multimodel Ensemble program (NMME), has demonstrated the potential for improving the skill of S2S forecasts and ha s produced many lessons for developing an operational MME. Operationalizing the curr ent NMME, which reli es on non-operational institutions supported by research funding, is no t necessarily recommende d, but there would be great value in the development of an opera tional MME forecast system that includes the operational centers of the Unite d States (Recommendation L). To make the rapid improvements to ope rational S2S prediction systems that are envisioned by the Committee, it will be genera lly important to speed the flow of information between scientists with research and opera tional foci (Recommendation M). This includes promoting and expanding existing mechanisms to facilitate knowle dge transfer\u2014such as NOAA's Climate Process Teams\u2014and developing new mechanisms to enhance researcher access to operational forecast data, including ac cess to archives of ensemble forecasts, retrospective forecasts, and ini tialization data. Additi onally, allowing researchers to conduct or request specific experiments on operational syst ems would provide an additional boost to the flow of discoveries a nd technical advances. Research Strategy 3: Improve Prediction of Extreme and Disruptive Events and of the Consequences of Unanticipated Forcing Events To improve the overall skill of S2S forecasts and provide more actionable information to users, the Committee identif ies two areas that deserve special attention, and to that extent we promote them to our third and fourth Research Strategies. Research Strategy 3 involves an increased focus on discrete events, and includes two sets of recommendations. The first is to emphasize the prediction of weather, climate, and other Earth system events that disrupt society's normal functioning (e.g., major winter storms, excessive rainfall events, monsoon onset and breaks, tropical storms, heat waves). Thus, in contrast to th e forecasts of specific weather events on a scale of days, improved S2S for ecasts would identify situations with high probabilities of disruptive consequences, es pecially for subseasonal forecast ranges (approximately 2-12 weeks). A coor dinated effort to improve the forecasting of these events could allow communities more time to plan for these events and mitigate damages. Improved Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 8 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY forecasting of disruptive events may also i nvolve developing \"forecasts of opportunity\"\u2014 identifying windows in time when expected skill is higher than usual at a particular place because of the presence of certain features in the Earth system, certain phases of large-scale climate patterns (e.g., seasonal cycl e, ENSO, or MJO), or certain interactions of these modes, slowly-varying processes, and external forcing. Studying these interactions and ensuring they are represented in models will be important for S2S prediction and for identifying forecasts of opportunity (Recommendation D). The second part of this research strategy i nvolves using S2S forecast systems to predict the consequences of disruptive events caused by outside forces. Such outside forces include volcanoes, meteor impacts, and human actions (e.g., aerosols, widespread fi res, large oil spills, certain acts of war, or clim ate intervention). Even though these events themselves are not predictable, their consequences may be\u2014in pa rticular the consequences on S2S timescales. A national system for projecting the consequen ces from these unanticipated events on S2S timescales would aid emergency response and disaster planning (Rec ommendation N). With improved coordination between government agenci es and academics, it would be possible to assist in recovery efforts by quickly generati ng S2S forecasts of the consequences of such unanticipated events shortly after they take place. Research Strategy 4: Include More Components of the Earth System in S2S Forecast Models The other area that the Committee believes needs more focused attention is the utilization and further development of advanced Earth system model components beyond the troposphere, which has been the traditiona l focus of numerical weather prediction. The S2S prediction problem is inherently a problem of capturing the coupled processes ope rating at the interface between various components of the Earth system, including the troposphere, stratosphere, ocean, cryosphere, biosphere, and land surface. Progress in recent decades has extended th e coupling of more model components and more comprehensive representation of processe s within these components in operational S2S forecast systems (see also Research Strategy 2) . However, there is an increasing need to accelerate the development of model components outside the troposphere and to improve their coupling within S2S forecast systems. In partic ular, it will be important to rapidly advance towards next-generation ocean, sea ice, and land surface modeling capability within coupled Earth system models, in addition to prepari ng for cloud-resolving capability in atmospheric models. This will include moving towards eddy-reso lving resolutions in the ocean, inclusion of ocean surface wave effects, and developing better representation of sea ice, land surface, and surface hydrological processes. Ot her strong candidates for improve ments to existing practices for operational S2S forecasting systems include a dvancing prediction capabilities of aerosols and air quality, soil-state and seasonal vegetation growth, and aquatic a nd marine ecosystems. Research is also required to better understand which added components have significant interactions with the weather and climate system as a whole, pointing to the need for dynamic integration into operational forecas ting systems (Recommendation I). Improving these model components may also be important for better predicting a wider array of Earth system variables on S2S timescal es (e.g., sea ice, ocean productivity, hydrology, air quality), even if they do not feedback strongly to the coup led system.

Supporting the S2S Forecasting Enterprise The research strategies outlined in the repor t will require advances in computational infrastructure to support S2S forecasting, and th e development and maintenance of a workforce ready to realize potential advances in S2S fo recasting. These challenges are not unique to the S2S enterprise\u2014they are also important in the weather prediction and climate modeling communities, among other te chnical enterprises. Similar to weather forecasting and climat e modeling, S2S prediction systems test the limits of current cyber-infrastructure. The volume of observational data, data assimilation steps, model outputs, and reanalysis and retrospective fo recasts involved in S2S forecasting means that the S2S modeling process is extremely data intensive. Advances in S2S forecast models (such as higher resolutions, increased complexity, the ge neration and retention of long retrospective forecasts) will require dramatic increases (likely 1,000-fold) in computing capacities , together with similar expansions in stor age and data transport. Earth sy stem models are not taking full advantage of the complexity of current compu ting architectures and improving their performance will likely require new algorithms that process mo re data locally and new algorithms to exploit even more parallelism. The transition over th e next decade to new computing hardware and software that is not necessarily faster, but is more complex, will be highly disruptive. Future storage technology will also be more complex and varied than it is today, and leveraging these innovations will require fundamental software changes. Facing these challenges and uncertainties about the future, the United States would benefit from developing a national plan and investment strategy to take better advantage of current hard ware and software and to meet the challenges in the evolution of new hardware and software fo r all stages of the prediction process (Recommendation O). There are numerous barriers to training a nd retaining talented workers in the S2S enterprise. S2S is complex and involves working across computing and trad itional Earth science disciplinary boundaries to devel op and improve S2S models, and across science-user decision boundaries to better design and communicate forecas t products. From the limited workforce data available, the Committee surmises that the pipeli ne of workers for the S2S enterprise is not growing robustly in the United States and is not keeping pace with this rapidly evolving field. Given the importance of S2S predictions to the na tion, a concerted effort is needed to entrain, develop, and retain S2S professionals. This invo lves gathering quantitative information about workforce requirements and expertise base to support S2S forecasting, improving incentives and funding to support existing professionals and attract new professionals, and expanding interdisciplinary programs to train a more r obust and diverse workforce to employ in boundary organizations that fill the space between S2 S modelers and forecast user communities (Recommendation P).

It sets forth a research agenda that describes what must be done\u2014 observations, basic research, data management , and interactions with users\u2014to advance prediction capability and improve societal bene fits. Despite the specificity in recommending what should be done, the report does not address the challengi ng issues of how the agenda should actually be pursued\u2014who will do what a nd how the work will be supported financially. Given that this research agenda significantly ex pands the scope of the current S2S efforts, the Committee believes that some progress can be made with current levels of support and within current organizational structures , but achieving even a considerable fraction of the S2S vision will likely require additional resources for ba sic and applied research, observations, forecast operations, and user engagement. The scope of the research agenda will also require closer collaboration between federal agencies and interna tional partners, better flow of ideas and data between the research and operational forecasting communities, and engagement of the entire weather and climate enterprise. Again, the Committee acknowledges that addr essing the challenge of dramatically improving the skill and use of S2S forecasts will require many different actions, but the Committee reiterates that these are the actions that will need to be pursued to achieve the full potential for S2S forecasting. The more that can be pursued within this research agenda, the closer the nation can be towards realizing the full potential of S2S forecasting and the more benefits can be produced for a wide range of users and the nation as a whole.

For the past several decades , forecasts of weather, ocean and other environmental phenomena made a few days ahead have yielded i nvaluable information to improve decision making across all sectors of society (Lazo et al ., 2011). Enhancing the capability to forecast environmental conditions outside the well-developed weather timescale\u2014 e.g., extending predictions out to several weeks and months in advance\u2014could dramatically increase the societal value of environmenta l predictions, saving lives, protecting property, increasing economic vitality, protecting the enviro nment, and informing policy choices. Indeed, forecasts in the subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) time range (defined in this report 2 weeks to 12 months; see Box 1.1) have the poten tial to inform activities across a wide variety of sectors as many important decisions are made weeks to months in advance. The potential of S2S forecasting has advanced su bstantially over the last few decades, as improvements in numerical modeling, in the Ea rth observing network, and in understanding of sources of Earth system predictability in the so-called \"gap\" between short-range weather and climate timescales (see below) have enabled the development of extended-range weather and seasonal climate forecasts. As the availability and skill of seasonal climate forecasts\u2014and more recently subseasonal predictions\u2014has improved, S2S forecasts are increasingly being used in sectors like agriculture, ener gy, and water resources management. But there is enormous potential to further increase th e benefits of S2S predictions. Ma ny sectors have yet to exploit even the S2S information that is currently availa ble. The user base could expand dramatically if the skill of S2S forecasts improves, if more variab les of the Earth system are explicitly forecast (for example, a wider range of conditions of the ocean, cryosphere, and land surface), and if users' awareness of and ability to apply S2S information to important decisions and actions increases. Because so many critical planning and management decisions are made in the subseasonal to seasonal time frame, it might be argued that the benef its of the longer range predictions has the opportunity to meet or exceed the current value of 0-14 day weather predictions if the quality, scope, and utilization of the forecasts can improve from their current state. S2S predictions may become even more valuable under anthropogenic climate change, as improved S2S forecasts could allow for the development of early warning systems that are becoming even more of a societal imperative in a warming world. MOTIVATION FOR THIS STUDY This report develops a vision for realizing the potential benefits of S2S Earth system predictions within the next decad e. It identifies key strategies and proposes a research agenda with specific recommendations to guide progres s towards that vision. There were four main motivations for initiating this study: The need to develop a research agenda to close the \"gap\" between efforts to improve numerical weather prediction (N WP) and climate modeling; Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 14 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY BOX 1.1\u2014Definitions of Subseasonal and Seasonal Forecasts This Committee's charge was to develop a research agenda for improving forecasting on subseasonal and seasonal timescales, and for the pur poses of this report, the Committee defined \"Subseasonal to Seasonal\" as a forecast range from 2 weeks to 12 months. There is no consensus on the precise meaning of a given forecast time. Often the forecast \"range\" is a combination of a lead time and an averaging period, where lead time refers to the period between when a forecast is initialized and when the forecast is first valid, while the averaging pe riod is the time window the forecast is applicable. Similarly, terminologies and definitions of forecast times related to subseasonal and seasonal forecasting vary across research groups and initiatives. The Committee's S2S definition reflects common usag e in the community, but it differs slightly from the definition of \"Intraseasonal to In terannual (ISI)\" used in the 2010 NRC report Assessment of Intraseasonal to Interannual Climate Prediction and Predictability , which covers similar scientific topics. ISI predictions are defined as ranging from 2 w eeks to several years. Thus the terms intraseasonal and subseasonal are virtually inte rchangeable both literally and in practice. However, the terms \"seasonal\" and \"interannual\" do have literal differences. The term \"interannual\" implies forecasts of year- to-year variability, and thus brings to mind a forecast of an annual mean one or two years in the future or perhaps a seasonal mean a year in advance, whereas the term \"seasonal\" in a forecasting context usually refers to a forecast of a seasonal mean one or more seasons in the future, or a monthly mean a season in advance. This Committee's definition of \"Subseasonal to Seasonal\" and the accompanying acronym \"S2S\" also differs from the WCRP/WWRP's S2S Project (Box 2.3), which defines \"Subseasonal to Seasonal (S2S)\" as ranging from two weeks out to a single season (e.g., approximately 2-12 weeks). The Committee made a conscious choice to avoid introduc ing a new acronym and terminology to cover the time period from 2 weeks to 12 months, and chose to use the S2S acronym to refer more broadly to subseasonal and seasonal forecasts. This is because the acronym \"S2S\" is now used rather loosely across the community to refer to both subseasonal and seasonal timescales. The need to expand and improve S2S forecas t capabilities beyond dynamical predictions of the atmosphere (i.e., to improve or devel op S2S predictions of the oceans, land surface and cryosphere, as well pred ictions of atmospheric vari ables such as aerosols); A desire to develop a more global S2S for ecasting capacity, especially to meet needs related to national security and humanitarian response; and A changing computing environment that may open up both new opportunities and challenges for Earth system prediction. As noted above and in the 2010 NRC report, Assessment of Intrasea sonal to Interannual Climate Prediction and Predictability (hereafter NRC, 2010b; or ISI Report; see Box 1.2), subseasonal and seasonal forecasting fall in a \"g ap\" between the curren t modeling capabilities used for short and medium term prediction and th ose used in climate projections. Because of the short lead times involved with numerical weat her prediction, efforts to improve weather forecasting have been focused on enhancing the accuracy of atmospheric and surface data for specifying initial conditions and on representing the short-term evol ution of the atmosphere from this initial state. Eart h system models that were first de veloped for making long-term climate projections have focused, in cont rast, on representing Earth system processes that evolve more slowly (such as large-scale atmosphere and ocea n circulation, the cryosph ere, the state of land surface, and feedbacks between components) and how these processes are influenced by external Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 1: Introduction 15 PREPUBLICATION COPY BOX 1.2\u2014Progress Since the NRC 2010 IRI Report The 2010 NRC report on Assessment of Intraseasonal to In terannual Climate Prediction and Predictability report and this report address much of the sa me phenomena and timescales, with the intent of improving ISI/S2S forecasts. However, this report provides an important update on the science and potential of S2S forecasts, especially on the subseasonal timescale, and the two reports further differ in areas of emphasis. The 2010 report focused attention on the sources and gaps in our understanding of ISI predictability, \"building blocks\" in the development and evolution of ISI forecast systems, an assessment of the performance of (then) current ISI forecast sy stems, and recommendations for strategies and best practices for future improvements to ISI forecasts. Three case studies\u2014ENSO, MJO, and soil moisture\u2014 were presented to highlight end-to-end considerations of ISI forecast systems. For each case study, the report described the scientific basi s for the variability and predictab ility, the manner in which forecast \"building blocks\" were developed and implemented to realize the forecast potential, and the gaps in understanding and treatment of each phenomenon. Considerable attenti on was given to \"best practices\" for ISI forecasts, focusing on four important aspects, including the production, reproduction, evaluation, and dissemination of prediction information. This report addresses all of these same areas but does not address predictions beyond 12 months, and places significantly more attention on widening th e consideration of S2S -relevant phenomena and associated Earth system processes\u2014and by extension on Earth system modeling and prediction. The aim of this expansion is to consider a wider range of sources of predictability, impacted quantities, and processes, including extreme weather and other di sruptive events. The latter dovetails with another significant focus of this report, which is the need to highlight the value proposition of S2S forecasts, in part through better engagement with the potential stake holder community. Finally, in its targeted effort to develop a U.S. research agenda to advance S2S for ecasting, this report gives consideration to the infrastructure and programmatic elements requi red for advancement, including workforce, cyberinfrastructure, and interactions between the research and operational forecasting communities. climate drivers (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions, volcanic activity, other aerosols, and solar variability). Although there is a traditiona l separation between research on weather and climate timescales, the boundaries between short-term a nd climate prediction are largely artificial (Shapiro et al., 2010). Because both fast and slow er-evolving aspects of the climate system are important to conditions that develop in the 2 weeks to 12 month forecast range, S2S forecasting systems require both close attention to initia l conditions and high-fide lity repres entation of coupling and feedbacks between mo re slowly varying aspects of the Earth system. The potential to close this \"gap\" is now supported by a body of re search indicating predic tability in the Earth system at all timescales (e.g., Hoskins, 2013). In th e S2S time range, this pred ictability arises in part from coupled ocean-atmospheric phenomena such as the El Ni\u00f1o -Southern Oscillation (ENSO) the Madden Julian Oscillation posphere interactions associated with the quasi-bienn ial oscillation (QBO) (see Box 1.3). Further S2S predictability may exist in other climate oscillations and th eir teleconnections, and in the Earth system response to slowly varying conditions in the ocean, la nd, and cryosphere, among other phenomena. Efforts are already underway in the Unite d States and internationally to exploit these sources of S2S predictability, st retching the lead time of weather timescale models forward and climate models backward, in part through the de velopment of improved and more highly coupled Earth system models.

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 16 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY BOX 1.3\u2014Examples of Modes of Variability There are a number of natural modes of variabilit y that have widespread effects on the weather and climate, including the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Osc illation (ENSO), (QBO), among ot hers. ENSO and MJO are prime examples of modes of variability that provide predictability at S2S lead times. ENSO is a coupled atmosphere-ocean mode of variability that involves slow variations in the equato rial Pacific that impact sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific, and associated cha nges in surface pressure and wind in the atmosphere that extend over most of the tropical regions. MJO exhibits planetary-scale features along the equator in pressure, winds, clouds, rainfall, and many other variab les, with the strongest anomalies in precipitation propagating from the Indian to central Pacific Oceans over a period of about 30 to 50 days. The MJO has traditionally been described as primarily an atmos pheric phenomenon, but recent research highlights the importance of interactions with the upper ocean in its propagation. The continued development of coupled Earth sy stem models also presents an opportunity to expand and improve S2S forecasts of envir onmental conditions well beyond the traditional weather variables, which represents a second majo r motivation for this report. There is a strong desire to develop more reliable S2S forecasts of conditions in the o cean, cryosphere, and on the land surface, and meeting these needs is becoming more important as the financial and societal implications of managing environmental risk b ecome more evident and larger in magnitude. Reliable ocean forecasts on S2S timescales, fo r example, could improve the safety and effectiveness of commercial, military, and human itarian operations at sea, in part by improving planning and ship routing by indicating ice-free and freeze-up likelihood as well as other ice and ocean eddy hazards. The desire for this type of S2S forecast highlights the importance of high- fidelity representation of ocean, sea ice, and land surface conditions in S2S forecast systems, in many cases for reasons beyond whether they fe ed back to influence the atmosphere. A third major motivation for this report is the increasing desire for an enhanced forecasting capability globally. In particular, the Department of Defense and State Departments desire S2S forecasting capability that can best support U.S. engagement anywhere in the world. In addition, commerce, agriculture, and civilian h azard warnings that are at the national level could be expanded to cover more of the world. Developing a comprehensive and skillful global forecasting capability poses an additional challenge because in many areas, only limited in situ weather data are publically available for use in evalua ting and improving forecasts. Finally, accelerating computer and software capabilities could allow S2S prediction systems to operate with greater spatial and temp oral resolution, more comp lete representation of interacting components of the Earth system, and more ensemble members for calculating uncertainties. Together with improved understandi ng of the physical proc ess governing the Earth system's dynamics and potential advances in the ability to assimila te data into more sophisticated models, new computing capabilit ies could allow for si gnificant gains in S2S predictions over the next decade. Despite these needs and opport unities for enhanced Earth system forecasts in the S2S time range, a coordinated national research agenda aimed at stre ngthening the contributions of S2S forecasts to public and private activities ha s not yet emerged. For al l of these reasons, the Heising-Simons Foundation, the National Aer onautics and Space Agency (NASA), and the Office of Naval Research (ONR) asked the Nati onal Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to undertake a study aimed at outlining a ten-year research plan to advance the nation's capacity to provide more skillful, comprehensive, and useful S2S predictions.

In order to meet this request, the cu rrent study reviews present S2S forecasting capabilities and recommends a national research ag enda to advance Earth system predictions at lead times of 2 weeks to 12 months. The study bu ilds on previous reports that have described a grand vision to significantly advance forecas ting accuracy, lead time, and prediction of non- traditional environmental variables (NRC, 1991b, 2008) , as well as reports that have discussed opportunities and best practices for intraseasonal- to-interannual prediction (NRC, 2010b). In the years to come, the research agenda proposed he re and the efforts that follow could produce increasingly accurate numerical models of the Earth system by describing its coupled interactions and future evolution, thus enhanci ng the value of weather, climate and other Earth system forecasts to society. THE REPORT ROADMAP This report addresses the Committee's charge in seven subsequent chapters. Chapter 2 provides context for discussions in the remainder of the report by presenting an overview of the history and recent evolution of the field of S2S forecasting, descriptions of recent and ongoing research activities, and a summary of the current status and ski ll of operational subseasonal and seasonal forecasting systems. Chapter 3 covers decision-making contexts, a pplications for S2S forecasts, the potential benefits of S2S predictions, attributes of effec tive forecasts, and user sensitivity to forecasting accuracy. The chapter also contains case studie s, including western U.S. water management, public health, and national security and defense, that provide more in-depth discussions of needs for and applications of S2S predictions. Chapter 4 introduces sources of S2S predictabi lity from natural mode s of variability and teleconnections, as well as from the ocean, soil moisture, terrestrial snow, and sea ice and external forcing. The chapter incl udes recommendations to further pr edictability research in the S2S context. Chapter 5 discusses in detail recent advances and activitie s needed to accelerate the improvement of S2S prediction systems, includi ng discussions of gaps and research needs related to routine observations, data assim ilation, and models, as well as calibration, combination, validation, and assessm ent of S2S forecast skill.

As a prelude to developing a U.S. research agenda for advancing subseasonal to seasonal for ecasting, this chapter lays out the history and evolution of the S2S forecast endeavor and brie fly summarizes current operational capabilities and research activities. EVOLUTION OF THE FORECAST ENTERPRISE Short to Medium Range Forecasts (Up to 14 Days) Modern weather prediction evolved from the global weather observations obtained during World War II, the computers that followed in th e wake of the war, and a working knowledge of equations that model the typical variations in the mid-latitude atmo sphere. Earth-sensing satellites, starting with the Television Infrared Observation Satellite Program (TIROS) in the 1960s, provided striking views of Earth's changing weather patte rns and contributed to the understanding of weather systems and to the improvement of routine weather forecasts. With these improved data sources and modeli ng capabilities, purely subjective forecasts based on atmospheric synoptic maps, experience, and intuition gave way to a combination of computer-generated atmospheric and marine forecasts based on physics equations and a statistical interpretation of the forecast info rmation. This know-how developed into highly capable systems operated by the civil and defense w eather services. In the la tter part of the 20th century, consumer interests in weather and the wi de demand for specialized forecasts stimulated a vigorous private sector operating alongside the public weather services (NRC, 2003). Similar trends are also occurring for ocean forecasting and applications. Moving into the 21st century, the combina tion of greatly improved atmospheric and oceanic observations and accelerating computer power has produced increasingly accurate and reliable atmospheric forecasts. Computer-calcu lated forecasts of globa l and regional weather patterns are now as accurate at 72 hours as they were at 36 hours in the 1990s (Figure 2.1). Although this might suggest that lead times for useful forecasts could continue to increase indefinitely with further improvements in obs ervations, understanding, and computer capability, the discovery of mathematical chaos in nonlinear physical system s in the early 1960s by Edward N. Lorenz (Lorenz, 1963) challenged this assu mption. Instead, Lorenz showed that unavoidable small errors in initial conditions will amplify during the computat ion, bringing a natural limit to the lead time that the \"weather\"\u2014or any give n natural environmenta l phenomenon\u2014can be Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

With the addition of aerosol chemistry and biogeochemistry, such models are of ten referred to as Ea rth prediction systems. Advances in coupled model syst ems are central to extending lead times and furthering accuracy of short and medium-term forecas ting capabilities in the ocean and atmosphere, are the basis for advancing S2S forecasts, and are critical for developing a more expansive set of routinely forecast Earth system variables. Seasonal Forecasts (3 to 12 Months) Long-range and seasonal forecasts began in th e mid-1950s as Weather Bureau forecasters noticed some identifiable large-scale pattern s and relations between atmospheric and ocean temperature anomalies in various locations (H oskins and Karoly, 1981; Namias, 1953; Roads, 1999; Walker, 1924; Wallace and Gutzler, 1981). Th ese early seasonal forecasts were made based on statistical methods. Dynamical seasonal predictions started in the early 1980s (Reeves and Gemmill, 2004), using atmosphere-only models with prescribed surface conditions. Often, the latest observed ocean anom alies persisted during the forecas t, but other surface conditions, like sea ice, snow cover, and soil moisture, were proscribed from climatology (e.g., average historical conditions). Such systems treated the surface as a fixed boundary condition, and generally ignored the coupled dynamics with the surface that evolve over the forecast period (two-tier system). Focused on El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO; see Box 1.3) prediction, the first coupled atmosphere-ocean forecasts were generated with simple dynamical or statistical models of tropical surface te mperatures (Cane et al., 1986; Graham et al., 1987; NRC, 1986, 1991a, 1994; Shukla, 1998). In contemporary seasonal forecast systems, many aspects of the Earth system are predicted in a coupled model involving the atmosphere, ocean, land, and cryosphere. These seasonal forecasts systems seek to better exploit ENSO as a source of predictability, while also representing more recently discovered predicta bility sources originating from other natural modes of variability of the coupled ocean-a tmosphere system; stratosphere-troposphere interactions; the slow evoluti on of ocean, ice, land hydrol ogy and biosphere; and radiative forcing from GHG and aerosols and land use changes (see Chapter 4). In dynamic seasonal prediction systems, modeled Earth system compone nts (atmosphere, land, o cean, and sea ice) are increasingly coupled numerically to represent the rapidly vary ing atmosphere exchanges of energy, water, and momentum, which give the syst em much of its predic tability on timescales longer than a few days. Additional progress could be made: some components, such as the ocean, are more realistically coupled w ith the atmosphere, while aspect s of coupling to the cryosphere and land are widely recognized to be oversimplif ied in today's forecast systems (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2013). Recent research indicates that much of the seasonal predictability in some parts of the world derives from trends associated with GHG warming superimposed on natural variability, thus more realistic representation of atmospheric chemistry and biogeochemistry (GHG forcing, land use changes, aerosols, etc. ) in seasonal prediction systems is also increasingly common (Dobl as-Reyes et al., 2006). Seasonal forecasting has improved over the last decade with efforts to reduce systematic model errors and with be tter understanding and represen tation of sources of predictability within the coupled Earth system. There are two other notable strategies for advancing the skill and Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 22 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY utility of seasonal forecasts. One is the in clusion of quantitative information regarding uncertainty (i.e., probabilistic pr ediction) in forecasts and probab ilistic measures of forecast quality in the verifications (e.g., Dewitt, 2005; D oblas-Reyes et al., 2005; et al., 2004; Palmer et al., 2000; Saha et al., 2006, among many others). This change in prediction stra tegy naturally follows from the fact that Earth system variability includes a chaotic or irregular component, and, because of this, forecasts must include a quantitative assessm ent of this uncertainty. More importantly, the prediction community now understands that the potential uti lity of forecasts is based on end-user decision support (Challinor et al., 2005; Morse et al., 2005; Palmer et al., 2000; Chapter 3), which requires probabilistic forecasts that include quantitative information regarding forecast uncertainty or reliability. The use of perturbed parameter ensembles re presents a second st rategy that is now commonly used to quantify uncertainty in the in itial conditions of seasonal prediction systems, though the number of such ensembles in both the forecast and the retrospective forecast vary widely across different oper ational centers (Appendix B). Ot her techniques have been implemented to account for uncertainty in mode l formulation. Most prominent among these is the development of multi-model ensembles (MME s). By combining the predictions from more than one model, MMEs quantify some of the un certainty associated with individual model formulations, and also tend to improve the fore cast, probably because errors in one model may not appear in the others. With a few caveats, MMEs that include multiple operational and/or research models appear to achieve a better ski ll than individual models, by combining different approaches to data analysis, data assimilation, model parameterizations and resolutions (Weigel et al. 2008; Kirtman, 2014; Kirtma n et al., 2014). Other technique s, such as perturbed physics ensembles or stochastic physics (e.g., Berner et al., 2008; Berner et al ., 2011) have now also been developed and appear to be quite prom ising for representing some aspects of model uncertainty (e.g., Weisheimer et al., 2011). Chapter 5 covers these developments in more detail. Subseasonal Forecasts (2-12 Weeks) A prevailing expectation is that subseasonal prediction in the 2-12 week range between short and medium-range and seasonal prediction poses serious challenges. This expectation arose because of the perception that the subseasonal a tmospheric forecast problem does not fit neatly into the simplistic paradigms of an initial-value weather forecast problem (because the lead times are too large and initial-value information can be lost) or the so-called \"boundary-value climate prediction problem,\" terminology associated with th e early seasonal climate forecast systems that were driven by prescribed surface temperature an omalies. However, recent work indicates the potential for predictability across all times cales (Hoskins, 2013; WMO, 2015a). There is evidence to indicate that the existing coupled ocean-atmosphere-ice-land Earth system forecast models, mentioned above, integrate the informati on from the initial conditions across the coupled system, including the slowly varying component s (e.g., ocean, sea ice, and land hydrology), to produce subseasonal forecasts with realized sk ill in traditional w eather variables often comparable to that of the seasonal forecasts (Dutton et al., 2013; Dutton et al., 2015). Predictability and prediction st udies on intraseasonal tropical variability and the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO; see Box 1.3) have furt her advanced the prospects of subseasonal forecasting (e.g., Lin et al., 2008; Vitart et al., 2007b; Waliser et al., 2006).

An important goal for subseasonal (and seasonal) fo recasting is to move beyond multi-day averages of typical meteorological variables to predicti on of the likelihood of im portant and disruptive events in all components of the Earth system, su ch as heat and cold waves, unusual storminess, ice cover, sea level, Gulf of Mexico Loop current position, etc. CURRENT STATUS OF ACTIVIT IES AND RECENT PROGRESS This section provides a brief survey of curre nt capabilities and ongoing activities in both seasonal and subseasonal prediction, along with recent progress at ope rational centers. This is a prelude to establishing a U.S. research agenda that will lead to improved S2S forecasts and better-informed decisions in both the public and private sectors. Seasonal Most operational centers have produced routin e dynamical seasonal predictions for more than a decade. A majority of the centers ut ilize global atmosphere, ocean, land, and sea ice coupled models (one-tier systems) to predict climate anomalies out to lead times of 6-12 months. There are a few centers, such as the Internati onal Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI 1), that use so-called two-tier systems, in wh ich the ocean component is predicted first, and then those predicted sea surface te mperatures are used as boundary conditions for an atmospheric forecast with lead times out to 3-4 months. IRI has been issuing seasonal climate forecasts from this system since 1997 (Barnston et al., 2010). Ex amples of one-tier systems include the U.S. National Weather Service's Climate Forecast System (Saha et al., 2010; Saha et al., 2006), which produces operational predictions with lead times of up to nine months, and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' (ECMWF) seasonal climate predic tion system, which is soon to be in its fourth generation2. Other nations have similarl y developed seasonal prediction systems that include models developed specificall y for this purpose, and the WMO Lead Centre for Long-Range Forecast Multi-Model Ensemble3, coordinated by the Korea Meteorological Administration and NOAA, collects seasonal forecasts from 12 such seasonal prediction systems (Global Producing Centers) and combines them into multi-model seasonal forecasts that are used by regional and local climate cente rs around the world (see Box 2.1). Seasonal prediction has been increasingly prominent at national and international operational centers for several decades. Almost all operational centers produce seasonal predictions at least once per month. Usually, determ inistic and probabilistic forecasts of seasonal mean anomalies of surface temper ature (atmosphere and ocean) a nd precipitation are issued for above, below, and near normal values. Seasonal outlooks and ENSO index predictions are also 1 http://www.wmo.in t/pages/prog/wcp/wcasp/clips/ outlooks/climate_forecasts.ht ml, accessed January 27, 2016. 2 http://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/doc umentation-and-support/evolution-ifs/ cycles/technical-description-seasonal (accessed February 3, 2016). 3 https://www.wmolc.org/, accessed January 27, 2016.

In addition to the ensemble of model integrations into the future, seasonal forecasts require a historical series of model integrations over past decades (these are also called retrospective forecasts, reforecasts or hindcasts). To create retrospective forecasts, the model configuration is integrating over a large samp le of historical case s (forecasts with known outcomes). These are then used to calibrate future forecasts for biases and reliability as well as to evaluate model skill. An average (or another stat istic such as an anomaly) over time is also required for the forecast to be meaningful. Fo r seasonal prediction, this averaging period is usually a season (three months). A common pract ice is to produce categorical (e.g., above normal, below normal, or near normal) probabili stic forecast of seasonal mean anomalies of some basic variables such as surface air temperat ure and precipitation at monthly lead times (see Figure 3.2). In addition to seasonal forecasts from operational centers throughout the world, collaborative international efforts aimed specifica lly at improving seasonal predictions have been critical for advancing forecasting capabilities. Many of these efforts have a focus on studying predictability and improving forecast skill via multi-model approaches. In addition to the MME seasonal forecasts issued by IRI, the Asia-Pacifi c Economic Corporation Climate Center (APCC) provides routine seasonal MME forecasts to member countri es, and the aligned Climate Prediction and its Application to Society (CliPAS) developed a database of retrospective forecasts for prediction and predictability re search (Box 2.1). The North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) is a demonstration project for S2S prediction involving universities and laboratories in the United States, the National Centers for Environmenta l Prediction (NCEP), and the Canadian Meteorological Center (CMC). NMME started producing seasonal multi-model ensemble forecasts in 2011 (Kirtman et al., 2014), and these are now issued in a quasi- operational mode (Box 2.2). In Europe, the Development of a European Multi-model Ensemble system for seasonal to interannual predictions (DEMETER) produced a co mprehensive set of seasonal retrospective forecasts in order to evaluate MME skill (P almer et al., 2004). The ENSEMBLES Program4 has built on DEMETER to assess how advances in indivi dual seasonal forecast systems translate into reductions in ensemble mean error (Weisheime r et al., 2009). ENSEMB LES has attempted to objectively evaluate uncer tainty in MME and other ensemble predictions at seasonal through decadal and longer timescales, including the relati ve benefits of different model and system configurations. Several model inte rcomparison efforts, including, the WCRP Seasonal Prediction Model Intercomparison Project (SMIP-2),5 have also provided valuable insights into model predictive skill and predictability. Subseasonal Building on a number of research and experi mental efforts over the last decade, subseasonal predictions began in ea rnest with the establishment of an MJO prediction metric and 4 http://www.ecmwf.int/en/research/project s/ensembles, accessed January 27, 2016. 5 Seasonal Prediction Model Intercomparison Project-2.

Along with Climate Prediction and its Application to Society (CliPAS)7 the aim of the APCC is to produce a well-validated multi-model seas onal prediction system to support the Asia-Pacific region. APCC has been collecting dynamic ensemble seasonal prediction data from affiliated centers since 2006, and it produces one month and three-month forecasts of precipitation, temperature at 850hPa, and geopotential height at 500hPa with lead times ranging from one month to six months. These forecasts are disseminated to APEC members, and verifi cation is conducted in compliance with the WMO guideline on verification of long-range forecasts. AP CC also produces routine forecasts of several climate modes including ENSO and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) on seasonal timescales, as well as the Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation (BSISO), which is an important modulator of Asian monsoon onset and breaks on subseasonal timescales. APCC also provides multi-model output-based statistical downscaling results for Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand, South Ko rea, and Japan. As examples, the output of these forecasts has been useful for predicting the electric ity demand in Japan and the local level forecasts in South Korean and Taiwan are being applied to drought forecasting to manage water resources. As part of the research activities of the APCC, CliPAS assembled a database of retrospective forecasts (1980-2004) to gain a better understanding of the factors that limit seasonal prediction (e.g., Wang et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009a) and to foster research on improving MM E methodologies (e.g., Kug et al., 2008; Min et al., 2014). BOX 2.2\u2014The North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) The North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME8) is a demonstration project for S2S prediction involving universities and laboratories in the United States, NOAA NCEP, and the Canadian Meteorological Center (Kirtman, 2014). NMME h as multiagency support from the NOAA, the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Department of Energy (DOE). The Phase 1 experimental real-time system started issuing forecasts in August 2011 (Kirtman, 2014). The Phase 2 system (NMME-2), with a slightly different suite of systems, began operations in August 2014 and is being used in a demonstration mode as part of the NOAA NCEP Climate Prediction Center (CPC) seasonal forecast system. NMME-2 participating centers, climate projection systems, and ensemble members are show n in Appendix B. Real-time data are provided to users on an NCEP server system, while retrospective fo recast data are provided by IRI and archival data are passed to the National Center for Atmospheri c Research (NCAR) as time and funding allow for research access. The first phase of NMME focused on seasonal-to-i nterannual timescales and only monthly data were collected. Due to the growing interest in for ecast information, there is a strong emphasis in NMME- 2 to focus on the 2-4 week timescale. The requirement s for operational S2S prediction are used to define the parameters of a rigorous retrospective forecast e xperiment and evaluation re gime. An additional focus of Phase 2 will be the hydrology of various regions in the United States and elsewhere in order to address drought and extreme event prediction. 6 http://www.apcc21.org/, accessed January 27, 2016. 7 http://iprc.soest.haw aii.edu/users/jylee/clipas/, accessed January 27, 2016. 8 More information on the National Multi-Model Ensemble is available at http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/product s/NMME/NMME_description.html and https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/ nmme/ (both accessed January 27, 2016).

As of 2009, the outputs from 10 operational centers have been used in an operational manner to provide ensemble predicti ons of the phase and magnitude of the MJO.9 These systems all produce daily ensemble forecasts (sizes range from 4 to 51) with lead time of 7 to 40 days. Some centers also produce single deterministic forecasts using high-resolution versions of their models. NCEP CPC receives the daily forecasts of zonal wind and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) from these centers and calculates the predicted MJO index. The forecast products are delivered as plume phase diagrams of the predicted MJO index for each center. APEC's BSISO forecasts ar e produced similarly (see Box 2.1). Many operational numerical weather prediction centers have also recently implemented extended-range (10-30 day) prediction systems th at provide building blocks for more useful subseasonal prediction systems (Brassington et al., 2015). Such forecasts are developed in three basic ways: (1) by using forecasting systems de signed for seasonal climate predictions, but utilizing only the first 30 to 60 days of the forecast, and paying more attention to the daily or weekly variations rather than the mean monthly or seasonal variations with in the forecast; (2) by running an air-sea-ice-land coupled model with a higher resolution th an the seasonal system; and (3) by extending the lead times of an ensemble medium-range weather forecast using a Numerical Weather Predic tion (NWP) model out to lead times of 30 days or more. Methods 2 and 3 produce systems that are independent of the seasonal system. Current operational systems include a 4-times-per-day, 4 member, 45-day l ead ensemble from the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS), a 2-times-per-week, 51 member, 46-day lead ensemble from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), a once-per-week, 21 member, 32-day lead ensemble from Environment Canada, and at least eight others. S ee Appendix B, Table B.2 for more detail on forecasts and the configuration of subseasonal forecast systems. Many of the same statistical considerations and associated trade-offs cited above for seasonal forecasting (e.g., forecast lengths and av erages, ensemble sizes, multi-model ensembles [MMEs], verification periods) ar e relevant for subseasonal for ecasting, although the shorter lead times for subseasonal prediction allow for incr eased verification instances for a given size observation period. A number of operational centers now compute retrospective forecasts (also known as forecast histories or refo recasts) as part of the operationa l forecast process and provide them along with the forecast itself. Frequently co mputing retrospective forecasts has allowed for continuous improvement of some as pects of forecast systems and permits the calibration to take account of recent events in the cu rrent weather/climate regime. As for seasonal forecasts, an important co mponent of subseasonal forecasts is the retrospective forecast, which is performed over a few years to decades in order to calibrate the real-time forecasts. In contrast to operational me dium-range weather prediction, there is lack of standardization among the centers in produci ng subseasonal forecasts. For example, some centers produce the forecast onc e a month, some once a week, so me twice a week, and some every day. Some centers start all the ensemble members from the same initial time, whereas others use a time-lagged method where they star t with different initia l times and therefore different initial analyses. The retrospective forecasts are also produced very differently, e.g., some on-the-fly, and some with a fixed model version which may not represent the latest operational configuration. These di fferences can make it difficult fo r data exchange, performance 9 http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa. gov/products/precip/CWlink/MJO/CLIVAR /clivar_wh.shtml, accessed January 27, 2016.

Further detail s of current subseasonal forecast systems' resolutions, lead times, ensembles, etc., can be found in Appendix B. Common targets for subseasonal prediction beyon d intraseasonal tropi cal variability (e.g., the MJO and BSISO forecasts mentioned above) include tropical cycl ones and extratropical weather. A number of centers provide long-lead in formation for one and two week outlooks depicting the probability of United States-based hazardous weather, as well as tropical cyclone frequency, tropical-midlatitude teleconnection im pacts, etc. (e.g., the National Centers for Environmental Prediction [NCEP]/Climate Predicti on Center's [CPC's] Gl obal Tropical Hazards and Benefits Outlook and U.S. Hazards Outlook10). These products are graphically highlighted areas with expected persistent above- or below-average rain fall and regions favorable or unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis in week s 1 and 2. The outlooks are based on expert combination of various statistical and dyna mical forecasts, including the MJO forecast mentioned above. More recently, the private sector has also become active in developing commercial subseasonal forecasts; for example, the NWS and ECMWF subseasonal forecasts have been combined in a commercial MME by the World Climate Service (Dutton et al., 2013; Dutton et al., 2015). Many centers produce forecasts at various lead times of the mean values and probabilities of anomalies averaged over periods of a week or a month. Research efforts to support the further development of subseasonal forecasts are also beginning to develop. The WMO's World Climate Research Program (WCR P) and World Weather Research Program (WWRP) have jointly developed a new initiative on Subseasonal to Seasonal Prediction (the S2S Project) (Robertson et al., 2015; Vitart et al., 2012; see Box 2.3 and Chapter 6 for additional information). The thrust of the S2S Project is on improving the subseas onal prediction of extreme weather, such as droughts, heat wa ves, tropical cyclone development, monsoon precipitation, and also subseasonal prediction in polar areas. To do so, th e project is collecting forecasts and retrospective forecasts from a number of operational modeling centers into a common database and disseminating them in delaye d mode for research purposes to the science and applications communities. In addition to the seasonal forecasts discu ssed in the previous section, NMME (Box 2.2) is also focusing on a second phase of effort to issuing in demonstration mode and further developing subseasonal forecasts and retrospectiv e forecast databases (see Chapter 6 for more details). These forecasts are issued in real time in near-operational mode, and are already used by NCEP Climate Prediction Center (CPC) to inform subseasonal ha zards outlooks, as well as being available to other users and for the purposes of predictability research and model and forecast system improvement. Recent Progress in Advancing S2S Forecast Skill There has been substantial progress in im proving the skill of both subseasonal and seasonal forecasts in recent years. Generally, fo recast skill for traditional atmospheric variables is still low (see discussion below), but the skill of forecasts of indices of coupled ocean-atmosphere modes of variability is often hi gher. For seasonal prediction, the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 index, a major indicator of the ENSO, show s useful skill up to one year in some models (e.g., Jin et al., 2008; Stockdale et al., 2011).

Specific attention will be paid to the risk of extreme weather, including tropi cal cyclones, droughts, floods, heat waves, and the waxing and waning of monsoon precipitation. The central activity of the S2S Project is the establishment of a multi-model data base consisting of ensembles of subseasonal (up to 60 days) for ecasts and supplemented with an extensive set of retrospective forecasts following THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) protocols. As of January 2016, nine operational centers (i.e., BoM, CMA, ECMWF, HMCR, JMA, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, retr ospective forecast and forecast data to the S2S Project archive (see Appendix B for details on these centers), with a total of eleven centers expected to be contributing by the end of 2016. Note that while this project leverages operational systems, the forecasts are disseminated with a three-week delay, and thus at present there is a focus on leveraging operational model output for research that can improve subseque nt forecast systems, rather than on issuing MME forecasts in demonstration mode. However, there are plan s to provide the forecasts in near real-time to the WMO Lead Center for Extended Range Prediction (WMO, 2015b). A major research topic will be evaluating the predictability of subseas onal events, including identifying windows of opportunity for increased for ecast skill with a special emphasis on events that have high societal or economic impacts. Attention will also be given to the prediction of intraseasonal characteristics of the rainy season that are relevant to agriculture and food security in developing countries. The Project's research implementation plan (WMO, 2013) calls for six subprojects that focus on key S2S research and application areas, including th e MJO, Africa, extreme weather, verification, stratospheric link, and teleconnections. The project will last five years, after which the opportunity for a five-year extension will be considered. ENSO variability with fair accuracy, and both ca pture the main ENSO te leconnection pattern in the tropical and extratropical re gions (e.g., Kim et al., 2012). Prediction skill of extratropical modes and patterns such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has also recently improve d. Scaife et al. (2014a) show good prediction skill of the winter NAO from the UKMO system, with a correlation in excess 0.6 between ensemble mean and observed NAO index for December-February for fo recasts from the start of November (Figure 2.2). They also show that the model is capable of capturing at least qua litatively the observed influence of ENSO on the NAO, as well as the infl uence of Atlantic heat content, sea ice from the Kara Sea, and the QBO on NAO seasonal pred ictability. The performance of this model relative to what was possible a few years a go was likely achieved primarily through reducing biases in the model atmosphere and ocean, leadin g to an improved model climate (Scaife et al., 2011). Increases in model resolution were also likely important. Similar progress in forecasting indices ha s also been made on subseasonal timescales. About 15 years ago, dynamical models had some MJO forecast skill out to 7-10 days (Waliser, 2011), but performed worse than empirical models that use statistical methods to predict MJO 11 Details of the S2S Project, including the database, cont ributing centers / forecast syst ems, descriptions of the subprojects, project organization can be found at s2sprediction.net.

Skill to 20 days is possible, for exampl e, during specific MJO phases (Lin et al., 2010; Rodney et al., 2013). Such contingent improvements in forecast skill, along with generally low skill for traditional atmospheric forecast variable s over large areas and ti me windows, highlights the importance and promise of so-called fo recasts of opportunity (see Chapter 4). The recent extreme low sea ice extent in su mmer in the Arctic prompted the Sea Ice Outlook12 to begin gathering seasonal forecasts in 2008. The first published skill of a retrospective forecast of sea ice extent appear ed soon after, in 2013 (Wang et al. 2013; Sigmond et al, 2013; Merryfield et al, 2013). Dynamical models exhibit skill at these lead times, but their skill is still substantially below estimates of pe rfect-model forecast skill (see also Figure 4.2). Further, no study has yet published an evaluation of S2S forecast skill at the regional or local scale for sea ice variables such as concentration, thic kness, or ice-type, which are likely to be useful to forecast users. In summary, over the past two decades substantial progress has been made understanding some of the physical drivers for S2S predic tion, and operational centers have made some progress in improving S2S forecast skill. While pr ediction skill for indices of climate modes such as the MJO and ENSO has improved more dram atically, current operational skill is low for many traditional weather and climat e variables. S2S forecasts for Earth system variables outside traditional weather and climate forecasts are less well developed, but have also been advanced by the development of coupled Earth system prediction systems. The growing interest by the science comm unity and operational forecast centers to develop and implement many of the projects a nd experiments described above, in addition to recent progress in S2S predictability research an d operational predictions, illustrates the research priority and expectations associ ated with S2S timescales. However, an associated U.S. national research agenda aimed at strengthening the cont ributions of S2S forecasts to public and private activities has not yet emerged. Finding 2.1: Although there has been consider able progress in S2S forecasting over the past several decades, there are still many opportun ities for improvements in S2S forecast skill. 12 http://www.arcus.org/s ipn/sea-ice-outlook, acce ssed January 27, 2016.

So me work indicates that a signi ficant portion of annual U.S. gross domestic product (tens of billions or even trillions of dollars) ma y be sensitive to the weather (Dutton, 2002). Regardless of forecasts ' exact economic value, there is growing recognition that subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) predictions coul d play an important role in reducing society's exposure to weather, climate, and other environmental va riability, both in the United States and globally (e.g. Th iaw and Kumar, 2015;World Bank, 2013). Realizing potential benefits of S2S predictions will require ph ysical science research to advance understanding of the many complex interac tions at play within Earth system and to overcome the many technical hurdles associated w ith translating such research into improved S2S forecast systems (see Chapters 4 through 7). However, a crucial aspect of realizing the value of S2S forecasts involves generating and a pplying knowledge about the many social and behavioral dynamics, as well as the legal and equ ity issues that are asso ciated with using such forecasts to improve decision making (NRC, 199 9, 2010a, c). While addre ssing the latter set of issues in their entirety is beyond the scope of this report, the Committee believe that it is important both to highlight in more detail the value proposition of S2S forecasts and to outline critical steps that the S2S research community can take to ensure that investments made in current and future S2S forecast systems are levera ged to maximize the ability to inform choice, action, and social and economic benefit. This chapter presents the context in which S2 S forecasts are or could be used by a diverse set of decision makers, highlights some ba rriers to use, and presents findings and recommendations to help ensure that future S2S forecast systems and forecast products realize their potential to benefit society. THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF S2S FO RECASTS TO DECISION MAKERS A number of federal, state and private us ers presented information to the Committee about how they make decisions for which S2S Earth system information is or has the potential to be a factor. Building on these pr esentations, the Committee devel oped information on a large set of sectors and decisions for which S2S forecasts are or have the potential to inform decisions (Figure 3.1, and Table 3.1). Case studies late r in this chapter e xpand upon some of these examples, including applications to water mana gement, public health, emergency response and national defense. As the case studies make clear, so me of the potential value of S2S forecasts lies in their ability to inform decision processes that begin months or even years in advance of a potential event. Often, the long-term average or climatology of a particular phenomenon\u2014such as assumptions for the seasonal volume of wate r held in a reservoir\u2014are incorporated into decision making as a first step. As the decision point draws near er, adjustments are made as additional information becomes ava ilable.

For example, many water managers can see the po tential application of seasonal and subseasonal forecasts to their work, and in some cases such information has provided valuable context for planning (see case water manageme nt case study below). However, the outcomes of forecast use have not always been positive; currently availa ble products do not always fit easily into institutional decision-making frameworks, and mana gers are eager for for ecasts of variables and at resolutions that are more directly relevant to their contexts. These point s are broadly consistent with published research on applications of S2S predictions to decision making, which to date focuses on the use of seasonal predictions in the agricultural, energy, or water management sectors (e.g., Breuer et al., 2010; Hansen Pagano et al., 2002). For example, Patt et al. (20 07) document how use of a seasonal forecast in Ethiopia enabled an emergency management team to identify specific relief actions with months of lead time, alleviating food shortages in 2002. In contrast, seasonal forecasts prompted the restriction of credit for seed in Zimbabwe in 1997, which prevented planting and led to food shortages even though seasonal rainfall ended up at near-normal levels. Beyond the experience of negative consequences of seasonal forecast use, one important set of documented barriers to the use of S2S fo recast products relates to mismatches between currently available products and the stated n eeds of end users. Forecast products currently available from organizations su ch as NOAA's Climate Prediction Center (CPC) or the seasonal MME forecasts from the APCC (see Chapter 2), for example, are issued in the form of low-resolution depictions of the probabilities of depa rture from mean temperature and precipitation over a 3-month period (Figure 3.2), or as for ecasts of climate indi ces such as ENSO. These forecasts, and text discussions that accompany them, provide general guidance on future temperature and precipitation, but they do not readily translate in to operational decision support for many applications. In agriculture, S2 S information could be used to assist in determining planting dates, irrigation needs, crop types, fertilization, expe cted market conditions, pests and disease, livestock mana gement, and the need for insura nce (Breuer et al., 2010; Mase and Prokopy, 2014). However, these decisions are dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and duration of weather events within the three-month forecast window, not departures from seasonal average conditions (Vit art et al., 2012; Srinivasan et al., 2011).

For example, seasonal forecast skill is enhanced by a strong El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Os cillation (ENSO) signal, but by the time forecasters have confidence of likely impact s from the event, many decisions on crops, water storage, or other resources have al ready been made. Furthermore, different combinations of forecast lead times and aver aging period may be more or less useful in different contexts (see also Chapter 5). 4. There is often a lack of understanding in and trust of forecasts. Many users do not understand the process by which forecasters come to their conclusions, and existing forecast verification metrics are often not direc tly relevant to users' contexts (Morss et al., 2008). Consequently, users often have litt le confidence in the forecast (Mase and Prokopy, 2014). Familiarizing users with the processes by which forecasts are produced often requires direct interact ion over a sustained time pe riod. Such interactions are expensive, resulting in fewer communication pathways between the producers and users. Thus a lack of resources issue often exacer bates this issue and hampers delivery of information to end users (see also Hansen et al., 2011; Klopper et al., 2006; Lemos and Morehouse, 2005). Such examples extend beyond agriculture. For example, forecasting events such as heat waves for the public health sector, or envi ronmentally caused anomalous electromagnetic propagation and mirages for ocean communications applications, have the potential to provide much greater value to decision makers than information about departures from average temperature and precipitation ac ross a wide region (see also ca se studies below). Contextual factors, such as lack of trust or inflexible personal or institutional operations, also impede forecast use in water management and public health sectors. In water management in the United States, for example, some institutions may even have policies that designate certain sources as official information, posing a barrier to the us e of new products (Lemos, 2008; Pagano et al., 2002; J. Jones, personal communication, January 2015) . Differences in perceptions of risk and bias, fear of bearing personal re sponsibility for making decisions based on probabilistic forecasts that are still less familiar to the public are also barriers to use in some cases (e.g., Suarez and Tall, 2010). Lack of resources can also influe nce the ability to access decision support. Although some private companies and research laboratorie s produce higher temporal or spatial resolution and tailored forecasts for their clients (e.g. IRI tailored products, and s ee case study on national security and defense), these ar e not necessarily widely availa ble to the public. Beyond specific barriers to use, many decision makers (and even en tire sectors) may not be fully aware of S2S forecasting efforts and the potenti al to apply such information to decision making (Buontempo et al., 2014; public health case study below). To summarize, the current use of S2S forecasts at present is primarily limited to general guidance, although there are emerging sectors and businesses that make more in-depth use of forecasts. Reasons for the slow adoption of a nd demand for S2S forecasts into operational environments include: (1) a poor fit between aspe cts of the forecast (skill, scale, and lead time\u2014 e.g., salience and credibility [Hansen et al., 201 1; Klopper et al., 2006]); (2) contextual factors such as lack of trust, inflexib le operations, market fluctuations , and lack of resources; and (3) lack of awareness.

The relative paucity of analysis about the use (or lack of use) of S2S for ecasts\u2014particularly subseasonal forecasts\u2014across multiple sectors and regions inhibits the understa nding of the potential value of S2S predictions and the development of strategies to maximize the benefits of S2S predictions to society. Finding 3.2: Research about the demand for and u tilization of S2S predictions across multiple sectors is still limited. Studies that have been conducted often indicate significant barriers to using S2S forecasts in decision making, incl uding mismatches between available and desired forecast products, barriers associated with poli cy and practice, and lack of understanding of what could be provided. Finding 3.3: Decision makers generally express a need for a wider range of skillful model and forecast variables\u2014particularly information abo ut the likelihood of disruptive or extreme events\u2014that are valid at finer spatial and tempor al scales to inform management practices. Some of the issues highlighted above are not new or unique to S2S forecasts. The weather forecast community, for example, faces many similar challenges, and a developing body of social and behavioral scie nce research on forecast use is beginning to increase understanding about how to overcome challenges associated wi th increasing forecast use in decision making (Brunet et al., 2010; NRC, 2010c). Learning from experiences on both the shorter-term weather forecasts, as well as leveraging existing knowledge about the use of seasonal forecasts, can provide guidance to maximize the use of subseasonal and seasonal forecasts across many more sectors of society. As an example, findings about the barriers to use of seasonal forecasts above are broadly consistent with prev ious research on the use of weat her forecasts, which identified similar types of information that users generally consider to be the most relevant to decision making (Pielke and Carbone, 2002): Extreme events, including droughts, hurrica nes, floods, blizzards, tornadoes, and thunderstorms (including hail); The benefits of good weather, meaning favorab le conditions for a particular activity; Routinely disruptive weather, defined as not extreme, but significant enough to warrant behavioral adjustments; and Forecast impacts, part icularly associated with misses and false alarms (including over- warning). Finding 3.4: Building on experience related to in creasing the usability and use of weather and seasonal forecasts will be important for rapi dly broadening the role of S2S forecasts in decision making. Uncertainty and Lead Times In addition to user-relevant forecast output vari ables and scales, there are key attributes of forecasts that must exist before a prediction can make a value-added contribution to decision processes. Forecasts must be available in a timely manner, be provided in a readily Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Different users have different tolerances fo r how accurate a forecast must be before it becomes useful to them. Some users need high confidence before they can take action, while others may be more tolerant of incorrect forecasts (Lemos and Rood, 2010; Mase and Prokopy, 2014). According to a cost-loss mode l, if the probability of occu rrence of an event exceeds the ratio of the cost of mitigation action to the lo sses that would be expected to occur without mitigation then the mitigation actions are considered worthwhile. Consequently, if the costs of action are high, then the user woul d require a higher level of certa inty that the forecasted event will occur (Murphy, 1977). Such specific probability thresholds are usually unknown to forecasters, however, as th ey are situationally and geographically dependent. Decision makers always operate under unc ertainty; even a 24-hour forecast has uncertainties. Such uncertainty is now frequently and more appropriately presented in terms of probabilistic forecasts. However, as has been show n by notable errors in weather forecasts, such as predictions of winter precipitation, when decisions have significant associated costs, people are more critical of forecast errors (Joslyn and Savelli, 2010; Roulst on and Smith, 2004; Savelli and Joslyn, 2012). Furthermore, seasonal forecast in formation, when presented at finer spatial and temporal scales, increasingly has larger boun ds of uncertainty. Thus, there may be a higher likelihood of an outcome that is different than the forecast at the particular location where the decision is made. When presented on a value or cost/loss basis, this may make decision makers reluctant to invest in actions based upon generally lower-skill, hi ghly probabilistic S2S forecasts. For example, a 53% probability of greater than normal snow fall may not justify contracting for additional snow removal availabi lity. However, in order to make valid value decisions and actions, decision makers need established reliabil ity measures. If preventive action requires steep costs, and reliability measures are not well developed, policy-ma kers are less likely to adopt (especially experimental or new) forecast products and are more like ly to resort to a wait-and-see position (Lemos and Rood, 2010). When confronted by crisis, however, such as reservoirs operating above or below their capacities, the wi llingness to use S2S forecast information may increase significantly (Lemos, 2008). Thus creating more skillful forecasts does not necessarily guarantee that the forecasts will be useable or used. To be useful, a user must also have confidence in the prediction. Confidence is typically established by evaluating the succ ess of the forecast ag ainst a large number of previous occurrences. However, S2S predicti ons have a number of major challenges in establishing such confidence. For example, because forecasts are typically averaged over weekly or longer time intervals, there are fewer data points against which to verify the forecasts. Furthermore, if users are interested in a pred iction of a weather-driven event such as severe flooding, then multiple forecast variables are involved, including precipitation amount and intensity, soil moisture, snow pack, and temperatur e. Errors in any one of these variables will lead to errors in the projected outcome. The i ssue of developing confidence in forecasts is of central importance to users, but also links centr ally to S2S forecast systems, and is therefore covered in greater detail in Chapter 5(see th e section on Calibration, Combination, Verification, and Optimization) Finding 3.5: Assessing tolerance for uncertain ty and developing user-oriented verification metrics are important to building confidence in the use of forecasts among decision makers. At the S2S timescales this aspect has been generally under-developed. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 44 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY IMPROVING THE USABILITY AND USE OF S2S FORECASTS Given the current barriers to use highlighted in the section above, th is section highlights potential avenues for increasing forecast uptake into decision making. Decision makers have a range of capabilities, from those able to apply st atistical techniques to extract useful information from forecasts, to those with le ss ability to modify or interpre t probabilistic forecasts. Tailored and interpreted forecast information has the poten tial to increase the value of S2S forecasts by expanding the range of forecast variables and output s that are available to specific users. Some tailored product variables may be obtained th rough the development of statistical models or correlation fields for relating existing forecast variables and spatial scales, such as regional temperature and precipitation av erages, to other, more usef ul variables (Mase and Prokopy, 2014). For example, extension agents in the agricu ltural sector prefer derivative information over simple climate predictions (i.e., forecasting impacts instead of seasonal departures of temperature and precipitation). Here, forecasts of the probabi lity of receiving sufficient precipitation during crop maturation or sufficient soil moisture for seed germination can help the agricultural sector anticipate the amount and tim ing of irrigation needs. Creating some tailored products is possible using currently available forecast output. Developing other tailored forecast variables will require advances in the S2S forecasting system itself, particularly through an expansion of the ca pabilities of coupled Ea rth system models that enable, for example, new forecast variables such as the occurrence of unusual surf or extreme waves, mean cloud cover, and likelihood of ha rmful algal blooms. Similarly, some progress on predicting the less probable but high-impact events, so-called extreme events, can be made through tailoring existing forecasts. Such events may include a very hot week in an otherwise near-normal summer. Because these are part of a continuous distribution, there is potential to predict the probability of such events occu rring within a forecast period. However, improvements in coupled model forecast systems ar e likely also needed to meet user demands for predictions of such extreme or disruptive events, especially since the noteworthy nature of extremes is typically sector specific. For ex ample, uncharacteristica lly low winds might not represent a problem for water, tr ansportation, or agricultu re sectors, but would be significant for the wind energy and air quality sectors. Qualitative interpretation of forecasts can al so increase their uptake and value. For example, simplified forecast discussions that accompany National Hurricane Center public advisories provide the explanations behind the fo recast that increases many users' trust of such forecasts. Thus increasing the use of such simplified forecast discussions in other routinely issued forecasts could yield almost immediate be nefits. However, careful thought needs to be given to how such information is integrat ed into decision-making processes (NRC, 2009). The multitude of potential applications, driven by a multitude of different decision makers with different needs requiring different formats, increases the complexity of production and dissemination of forecast information. To some extent, private sector providers may develop products that meet this need, but on a large, advisory scale it is likely that the producers of information will need to consider multiple format s, along with broader scale efforts to develop tailored, sector-specific products. Finding 3.6: Many forecast products that have the potential to provid e greater benefit to society could be developed from existing mode ling technology. Developing other important forecast variables and uses will require advances in modeling technology. These variables are Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The Need for Social and Behavioral Sciences As highlighted in the paragraphs above, developing a system that supports use of S2S information requires more than increased unde rstanding of sources of predictability and improved prediction skill. Advances in use and value require consider ation of the decision- making context, which often requires complement ary research in the social and behavioral sciences. Specifically, social science research can help to address many of the barriers to use previously highlighted in this chapter, includi ng increasing understanding users' confidence in the accuracy of forecasts, understanding users' decision-making contexts and how to best integrate forecast information, and understanding decision making in contexts of high uncertainty and limited skill (see also NRC, 2010c). This includes research into how users react to false alarms and the costs associated w ith incorrect forecasts, and how probabilistic information can be better communicated to fit in to users' operations (R. Morss, G. Eosco, S. Jasko, J. Demuth, personal communication, Marc h 2015). Social science re search on perceptions of quality\u2014e.g., at which point users will make an investment of time and resources to integrate forecasts in their operational contexts and what types of products are needed to mesh into existing decision-making infrastructures\u2014will al so be important to understanding the potential value of S2S forecasts. As much of S2S informat ion is probabilistic, research will be needed on the interface between probabilistic forecasts an d decision maker applications to determine new ways of translating forecasts to mesh with common usage of other Earth system information. This may involve setting more nuanced decision limits, particularly around low probability predictions (e.g., 51-55%). Additional research is al so needed on the role that social networks may play in the dissemination of inform ation and practice (e.g ., Mase and Prokopy, 2014). Finding 3.7: Understanding decision contexts for a wide array of users in both sectoral applications and technical capacities is essentia l for increasing use of S2S forecasts. Such understanding cannot be advanced without so cial and behavioral science research. Integrating Users into the Process of Developing Forecast Products Perhaps even more critical than improving forecast products and access is building trust in the S2S forecast process. Scientists and opera tional forecasters who create the information are often disconnected from how that information is being applied, at le ast outside of agency operations (Lemos et al., 2012). Broader use of S2S forecasts will be encouraged by creating systems of integrated actors and organizations th at initiate, modify, import, and diffuse science and technology, identifying information pathways, relating new information to prior experience of the users, and creating toolkits to enable application of informa tion to various decision contexts (Lemos et al., 2012; Vitart et al., 2012). This requires integration of users in decisions relating to the research and development process, from defini ng relevant research questions to the process of production and dissemination of products (L emos and Morehouse, 2005). Developing a mechanism for integration may be informed by existing mechanisms used for Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 46 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY integration of NWP forecasts with a variety of user s, but will need to be adjusted for different circumstances related to the production of S2S forecasts. Model developers and operations in NWP interact with a variety of forecast centers around the country and with the media in annual meetings and routine correspondence. To th e extent practical, e xpanding this existing stakeholder network to include mechanisms fo r collaboration with S2S model developers and operations would be beneficial as compared to developing a se parate network from scratch. The discussion of opportunities and limitations involved in producing S2S forecasts highlights potential trade-offs and risk of using the products that enhances the users' confidence in adopting new products or practices (Lemos et al., 2012). Such discussions are facilitated, in many cases, by boundary organizations, such as NOAA's Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISA) Program and the IRI. Th ese organizations conduc t interdisciplinary research on decision-making proce sses with the goal of better c oupling the production and use of climate information (Goddard et al., 2014; Lemo s and Rood, 2010; Pulwarty et al., 2009). The growing experience of these orga nizations points to the consid erable effort and long-term relationships that are needed to help users unders tand what types of forecasts are available, the process of producing the forecasts, and to engage them in the design of forecast products and aligned decision-making frameworks to take advantage of currently available forecast technology. For example, IRI has found that seasona l climate forecasts of relatively low skill can still be successfully applied to water management problems in Brazil and Chile, but only through coupling climate forecasts with streamflow projec tions and working with ma nagers to explicitly link such tailored forecasts to their reservoir management decision-making process (Robertson et al., 2014). Similarly, malaria early warning systems based on S2S forecasts have been successful through extensive efforts to forge relationships between end users and physical and social scientists who manage the technical aspects of designing forecast products (see case studies below). Growing experience among interdisciplinary researchers has resulted in a similar set of conclusions relating to the benefit of 'co-produ cing' forecast products and information together with the end users of such info rmation (Meadow et al., 2015). Finding 3.8: An ongoing, iterative process between the developers, the providers, and potential users facilitated by the relevant social scien ce researchers improves the use and value of S2S predictions. Ongoing engagement between decision makers and scientists i nvolved with producing forecasts can facilitate the development of ite rative or multi-step decision-making processes, such as the \"ready, set, go\" framework. Here, warnings, preparation, and action are keyed to increasing probabilities of adverse events (e.g., Coughlan de Perez and Mason, 2014 ). Preliminary planning may be initiated when an extended S2S prediction i ndicates the possibility, perhaps at a small probability, of a significant event. This would be followed by preparatory actions (such as prepositioning emergency supp lies) if subseasonal predictions indicated increasing probabilities of the ev ent. Finally, action (such as ev acuation) would be initiated based on a deterministic or short-range ensemble prediction with a high le vel of certainty. This scenario assumes a reliable transition of the pr edicted probabilities between the seasonal climate system, the subseasonal system, and the short range deterministic or ensemble systems\u2014all with their own statistical characteris tics and skill levels. Blending the probabilities on these diverse timescales (and possibly spatial scales as reso lution improves) into a coherent chain of predictions for a user is a diffi cult post-processing challenge. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 3: Enhancing the Value and Benefits of S2S Forecasts 47 PREPUBLICATION COPY As mentioned above, the decision makers will be concerned with some measure of risk and consequence based on a combination of the e volving probability of the adverse event and the costs of mitigating compared to those of not m itigating. The more quantitative the model of risk and consequence, the more meaningful will be the estimates derived from the evolving probabilities of the adverse event. Not all organi zations will necessarily pa rticipate in all three stages. Certain organizations may enter the proces s at different points a nd levels of certainty. The set of actions taken and th e probability thresholds that act as triggers are usually dependent upon users' unique circumstances and in stitutional landscapes. Developing models for applying S2S information in these types of scenarios represents an opportunity for growth in the private sector. For example, applications requiring acquisition of resources, such as power poles in advance of an expected ice storm, may require more lead time than others for which resources are already available, such as fr ost protection for an orchard. Such decisions are not static; they are revised as new information becomes available, including reduced uncertainty as the forecast lead time shortens. Decision processes on weather timescales could be inst ructive, such as how public safety officials change th eir decisions from the timescales of outlooks several days before an event to watches and then warnings. Finding 3.9: Successfully aiding users with a multi-step decision model for mitigating the effects of adverse events is a di fficult challenge and one not yet considered carefully in the S2S prediction community. Resources Required to Encourage Use Developing interactive, transparent processes is a time-consuming and expensive process. It is constrained by limited resources of res earch, forecasting and many user communities. As forecasting capabilities improve, the demands user s place upon providers of forecast information will only increase. Forecasters and researchers need to be careful not to over-promise the capabilities of improved systems. Especially if they are unable to also address the translation process, the demand for services and interpretation of products ma y exceed the level that can be met, resulting in disenchantment and abandonment of forecasts (Meinke et al., 2006). As mentioned above, boundary organizations can play an important ro le in facilitating transparent dialogs and processes that can help overcome many barriers to forecast use. There are many existing structures that are engaged as boundary organizations at the weather and climate change scales, including the NOAA RI SA Program, IRI, National Weather Service Forecast Offices, the Department of Interior's Climate Science Centers, the Department of Defense Climate Services, the emergent US DA Climate Hubs, and other programs within academia. All of these programs and offices enga ge with decision makers and possess expertise in social science methodology coupled with a ph ysical understanding of weather or climate. They often work in interdisciplinary teams and with those intermediaries who ultimately reach the individual decision makers. Finding 3.10: Growth in the use of S2S produ cts will place more demands upon operational agencies and boundary organizations to explain reasoning employed in producing forecasts, and in developing a suite of products that me et the needs of a diverse user community.

Fe deral, state, and local water managers in California, for example, seek improved forecasts in order to stretch their ability to balance the needs of 38 million residents (representing 12% of the U.S. population), the needs of an agriculture sector that farms ove r 9 million irrigated acres and le ads the nation in production, and demands for hydroelectricity from the state's 13,765 MW of capacity. 13 The state's recent, severe drought (e.g., Griffin and Anchukaitis, 2014) has onl y heightened awarene ss of the challenges associated with meeting these needs (Figure 3.3). In California, winter precipitation makes up the majority of the annual water budget, and estimates of spring run-off from winter snowp ack are currently used to help manage and coordinate the in- and outflow from the state' s vast system of reservoirs, aqueducts, and groundwater storage facilities. A primary tool us ed for making decisions about reservoir levels, water allocations, and water transf ers is the California Department of Water Resource's forecast of total April - July river runoff. These for ecasts are issued beginning in February, and are updated monthly through May. Water-year (i.e., September - August) based indices are also issued based on historical analogs. In other we stern states, similar forecasts are issued by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service in partnership with NOAA/National Weather Service (NWS). The skill of these forecasts is curre ntly derived entirely fr om a sparse network of snowpack measurements, which means they are not readily disaggregated by month. In contrast to forecasts derived from obs ervations of the winter snowpack, water managers have not relied heavily on the curren t array of operational S2S weather and climate forecast products. When used, the forecasts tend to be assessed qualitatively and used as a 'tie- breaker' in higher-stakes, scar city situations (M. Crimmins , personal communication, March 2015). There are a number of barriers to use of cu rrently available S2S forecast products. First, users may not be aware of times when forecast products have higher skill, such as during a strong ENSO event. This potential variability of skill from month-to-month is critically important in the California context. Second, the spatial resolution of current S2S forecasts is often inadequate for quantitative use. Finally, institutional barriers can sometimes limit the use of experimental information. For example, stat e and federal water managers are sometimes restricted to using only forecasts that are opera tionally issued by federal agencies in their decision-making process (J. Jones, personal communication, January 2015). Water managers are in broad agreement th at better S2S forecasting could improve the basis for a number of their decisions. On th e subseasonal timescale, efforts to incorporate quantitative precipitation and temp erature forecasts from existing numerical weather and climate predictions may help improve th e temporal resolution of river run-off forecasts and allow for better decisions about, for example, flood control. For example, anticipating atmospheric river events with several weeks' notice would allow ma nagers to assure capacity to contain excess runoff. During dry winters, the likelihood that drought will persist into late winter and spring is information that is also consiste ntly sought, but is not yet reliably available. This might again be achieved through better anticipation of the likelihood of extreme preci pitation events associated 13 http://www.energy.ca.gov/hydroelect ric/, accessed January 27, 2016.

However a few emer ging efforts provide a glimpse into how improvements in Earth system forecasting c ould enable important advancement in the management of disease and other public health risks. Meningitis Improved subseasonal (in particular for 2-4 week s) forecasts of relative humidity have the potential to improve response to meningococcal meningitis epidemics, particularly those in the so-called meningitis belt of central Africa (Pandya et al ., 2015; Thomson et al., 2006b). Meningitis, a bacterial infection, has a history of deva stating impact in this region, with large outbreaks affecting hundreds of thou sands of people. Untreated infe ctions lead to death 50% of the time (WHO 2012). Epidemics in the Sahe l region emerge during the dry season, and correlations between low humidity and meningitis cases were firs t noted more than 30 years ago (Greenwood et al. 1984). Further research reveal ed strong relationships between meningitis and dusty, dry conditions (Sultan et al., 2005; Thomson et al., 2006b) , and abrupt cessations of epidemics with increases in humidity (Moles worth et al., 2003). However, environmental conditions are only one of many factors, including demographi c, behavioral, and ecological conditions, which can precipitate infection. Specifically, in ma ny regions, lack of disease surveillance limits the potential to develop accurate disease tr ansmission models of any kind. This can make translating co rrelations between disease and environmental conditions into actionable information very challenging (Pandya et al., 2015; M. Hayden, personal communication, March 2015). The MERIT (Meningitis Environmental Resear ch Information Tec hnologies) initiative was launched in 2007 by the World Health Organi zation (WHO) as a multi-sector partnership between climate and environmental scientists, social scientists, and the public health community to encourage collaboration and the developm ent of innovative soluti ons for controlling meningitis epidemics (Thomson et al. 2013, Garcia-P ando et al. 2014). Years of subsequent data collection, climate data and forecas t output analysis and collaborati on with public health officials in Ghana has led to the development of relati ve humidity thresholds that can readily be incorporated into existing public health fram eworks. Forecasts of re lative humidity and storminess up to two weeks in advance, coupled with the observed two-week lagged relationship between humidity and meningitis, have led to a prototype decision-support tool that issues meningitis predictions at lead times of up to one month\u2014enough time to influence positioning of vaccines (Pandya et al., 2015). Th e end of the dry season is paced by the annual northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, but rainfall ev ents can modulate the timing of seasonal change on local-to-regional scales (Fig ure 3.4). Knowledge genera ted in developing the prototype early warning system is now driving research into the dynamics of west African monsoon onset and retreat that is specific to me ningitis-prone regions (e.g., Broman et al., 2014). Rainfall events are usually associated with Afri can easterly waves, equato rial Kelvin e MJO (Mera et al., 2014) . Better representation of these phenomena in forecasts may thus increase predictability of the end of the dry season and of meningitis risk. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

This list contai ns some of the world's most devastating diseases, such as cholera, dengue fever, and West Nile virus. In many cases, non-traditional forecast output variables, such as ocean nutrient forecasts in addition to ocean temperature information for cholera (e.g., Jutla et al., 2011), da ily temperature fluctuations inst ead of average temperature for dengue virus and malaria (Lambrechts et al., 2011; Paaijmans et al., 2010), and extreme rainfall and temperature events instead of average conditions for a variety of other public health disasters (Coughlan de Perez and Mason, 201 4), are likely to be important . Close collaboration between the forecasting and applications communities is crit ical to develop research agendas that will support the identification and development of new forecast products that maximize benefits to the public health sector (Buontempo et al., 2014; Morse et al., 2005). National Security and Defense One specific area where S2S forecasting could pr ove particularly beneficial on a routine basis is global ocean and ice predictions, particul arly as the Arctic warms. In addition, disaster preparations in advance of cat astrophic tropical cyclones and other severe events where the military may be called to respond could benefit from pre-staging of relief efforts around the world. Food and water security will be important areas where S2S prediction can contribute key information to national security, and having insi ght into possible famine due to drought or flood conditions will be crucial to economic a nd stability concerns in the future. There are important decisions that the defens e sector makes regarding military operations which involve advance warning of environmenta l conditions on S2S timescales include: vessel planning; war games; tactical planning; disaster relief; search and rescue advance planning (e.g., in the Arctic). In addition, ther e are serious threats posed by extreme events to military facilities in vulnera ble locations. For example, military facilities on the remote Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia house the Air Force Sa tellite Control Network which serves as an essential GPS command a nd control hub (Vedda, 2011) . Other installations vulnerable to extreme weather and ocean events include Bahrain, Guam, Eglin Air Force Base, FL, and Norfolk, VA. The Department of Defense (DOD) currently uses standard public climate data sets, forecast model products, and specialized data sets, models, and methods developed by DOD (Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanogra phy Center [FNMOC], Naval Oceanographic Office [NAVO], Air Force Weather Agency [AFW A]). DOD has, and co ntinues to develop, advanced and tailored products to aid deci sion making. These include predictions about performance of equipment and people/organiza tions given environmen tal conditions. DOD has many downstream decision-support tools into which the predictions feed. For example: 1. Commander Third Fleet ship operation planni ng in the eastern North Pacific utilizes seasonal forecasts of NE Pacific winds a nd waves, by month based on both standard climatologies and statistical predictions derived from multiyear model reanalyses as a basis to revise/update the timing of the operations.

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 3: Enhancing the Value and Benefits of S2S Forecasts 53 PREPUBLICATION COPY 2. For tropical cyclone/hurricane predictions, 2- 4 week timescales and below are essential for avoiding adverse impacts to sea operations before, during, and af ter cyclone passage. Military exercises, supply chains, and sh ip movements are vulnerable to tropical cyclones. DOD currently issues monthly tropi cal cyclone formation probability forecasts based on dynamical-statistical ensemble foreca sts (Navy statistical module attached to the NOAA dynamical model output Climate Forecas t System version 2 (CFSV2), which are 1-2 week Climate Prediction Center (CPC)-issued forecasts of above and below average probability of cyclogenesis and rainfall). 3. Piracy activity predictions (Figure 3.5) are base d on forecasts of wave height and surface winds in the Indian Ocean, and a statistic al module relating oper ations/behavior to environmental conditions and similar models fo r disaster relief operations, etc. Versions of this methodology are also used by agencies involved in migrant and drug interdictions. 4. Forecasts of beach and amphibious landing conditions for planning are based on high- resolution air, ocean, wave, and surf model pr edictions from histor ical reanalyses and statistical/analog techniques. To summarize, for this type of decision making, the DOD has a well-developed capacity to utilize and ingest the type of tools/specialized forecasts that users often demand. But areas for improvement abound. In the short-term, improve ments in observations for setting initial conditions (especially in areas with insufficient observations like oceans and geographic regions like Africa and the Western Pacific), and in fo recast skill covering the global oceans are especially needed (see Chapter 5). On slight ly longer time horizons, improvements in S2S predictions will be vital for fu ture tactical and operational planning under climate change. For example, there is great need for better-integrate d predictions of sea ice in a changing Arctic. The Navy and Coast Guard have focused attenti on on Arctic via their 2014 Roadmap and 2013 Strategy, respectively (US Navy Task Force Climate Change, 2014; USCG, 2013). Indeed, Arctic installations are some of the most vulnerable. \"The combination of thawing permafrost, decr easing sea ice, and ri sing sea level on the Alaskan coast have led to an increase in coas tal erosion at several Air Force radar early warning and communication installations. Accordi ng to installation officials, this erosion has damaged roads, utility infrastructure, seawalls, and runways.....As a result, only small planes or helicopters ar e able to land in this locati on, as opposed to larger planes that could land on the runway when it is fully functional. Daily operations at these types of remote rada r installations are at risk due to potential loss of runways, and such insta llations located close to the coastline could be at risk of radar failure if erosion of the coastline con tinues. Air Force headqua rters officials noted that if one or more of these sites is not opera tional, there is a risk that the Department of Defense early warning system will operate w ith diminished functi onality.\" (GAO, 2014) For the Coast Guard, there is an acute need to engage in medium-range (subseasonal) response planning in the event of an accident in Arctic seas (for ex ample an oil spill or a cruise ship evacuation). Navy forces are also much more likely to be engaged in the Arctic to assist Coast Guard search and rescue and other civil support operations (US Navy Task Force Climate Change, 2014).

To help meet this challenge, there was a ma ssive mobilization of the relevant scientific community to document the ev ent observationally and unders tand its consequences (e.g., Lubchenco et al., 2012). This response include d model forecasts and predictions, with three additional near-term ocean forecast systems being added to the initial three member ensemble used for 72-hour surface slick predictions (Lub chenco et al., 2012). For S2S timescales, both National Center for Atmospheric Research (N CAR)/ Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) (Maltrud et al., 2010) and NOAA/ Geophysical Fluid Dynamics La boratory (GFDL; existing regionally eddy-perm itting (1/10\u00b0 and 1/8\u00b0 horizontal resolution respectively) global Earth system models to e xplore the long-term tran sport and dilution of hydrocarbons or the resulting oxygen drawdown from the spill. Despite the mobilization of the climate a nd ocean modeling community to address the consequences of the DWH, a frenzy of popul ar media activity during the spill created a particularly challenging environment for clearly communicating credible scientific guidance regarding what could be expected on S2S timescal es. There was at times a particular focus by the official sources on defending the government's sc ientific integrity, especially after the first official estimates placed the flow rate as at least 5,000 barrels per day based on observed surface slicks, but subsequent analysis by academics revealed the true rate to be an order of magnitude larger (McNutt et al., 2011). During the event, there was also extensive speculation by scientists from a wide range of backgrounds about the implica tions of the spill, often going directly to the media without first passing through peer review. For example, one widely covered NCAR press release on June 3, 2010 with vivid animations (Fi gure 3.6A) was based on sc ientifically correct ocean model simulations, but was widely misinter preted in the popular press as suggesting the impending arrival of harmful concentrations of oi l along the entire east coas t of the United States (McNutt et al., 2011). About the same time, NOAA scientists developed projections of the regional spreading and dilution of dissolved oil and the possibility of significant oxygen drawdown in the deeply submerged plumes of oil that took into account the estimated spill rates and the biological consumption of oil (Adcroft et al., 2010). These projec tions were based on a prototype high-resolution climat e model and extensive input from NOAA's oil-spill projection team. An animation from this study (Figure 3.6B) correctly depicted the lo calization of dissolved oil from the spill to the Northern Gulf of Mexi co, but as a new government product, it was only publicly released after being pub lished in a peer-reviewed journa l, about two weeks after the well had been capped. These two early studies illustrate some of the specific challenges of using innovative modeling tools to provide insi ghts during an emergency. The particular challenges of communicating across scientific di sciplines and using scientific expertise to inform the public awareness during a high-profile incident like DWH has led to calls for the development of a \"community of disaster science\" (McNutt, 2015) , with expertise that can be applied to responding to a wide range of high-profile events.

A portion of these resources was never used, and with more skillful S2S forecasts, could have been sent to alternate locations where they would have been of much greater value (D. Payton, personal communication, June 2015). There is a high cost to incorrect projections of the direction of an oil spill, and in an emergency there is little time to identify the s ources of incorrect current directions or other model biases. For use in official government guidan ce, therefore, it is important that models are observationally validated or have their qual ity otherwise established. For an unprecedented forcing event, observational validation may be im possible, and scientific journals' peer-review and embargo may be inconsistent with the time constraints of the situ ation. Thus alternate approaches may be required for establis hing legally required quality assurance. As result of the challenges in coordinating the broad part icipation of the scientific community to DWH, a number of the leaders in the response to DWH jo ined together to found the Scientific Partnerships Enabling Rapid Re sponse (SPERR) to promote rapid communication and coordination of efforts and sharing of expert ise during disasters. This was a one-year pilot project that ended in 2015, but such efforts provide a forum for developing the expertise and frameworks necessary to build cap acity on forecasting the consequences of unanticipated events. This is an important step towa rds developing a \"community for di saster science\" in advance of an incident (McNutt, 2015). Nuclear Events Catastrophic/unprecedented (unusual/infreque nt) events include nuclear power plant accidents that could distribute radioactive mate rial over wide areas and impact many nations (e.g., Chernobyl and Fukushima), and intentional nuclear detonations aff ecting large populations (e.g., Nagasaki and Hiroshima). A ccidental radiological release ev ents have the potential to impact the air/sea over S2S timescales. Linked m odeling systems encompassing the Earth system components can provide important benefits in fo recasting the scope of impacts (Pullen et al., 2013). Nuclear weapon scenarios in the current geopolitical cont ext include limited nuclear exchanges. The range of possible scenarios tr anscends the \"mutually assured destruction\" envisioned during the Cold War where nuclear winter was an assu red outcome (NRC, 1985). Recent simulations of a regional nuclear exchange (100 15-kt yield) with a comprehensive Earth system model including atmospheric chemistry, o cean dynamics, and interactive sea ice and land components have revealed significant impacts at S2S timescales (Mills et al., 2014). Under this scenario, black carbon injected in to the stratosphere would de liver global ozone losses of 20- 50%, reduced sunlight, and catastrophi c effects on global crop yields. In the immediate aftermath of such rare events, emergency response-focused simulations would be conducted through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center (IMAAC ) utilizing DOD Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) for national consequences. (S eparately, the Departme nt of Energy [DOE] National Atmospheric Release Advisory Ce nter [NARAC] and DOD DTRA consequence assessment assets can be mobilized for internati onal events, as in Fukushima.) However, these simulation tools were not designed to provi de forecast information on S2S timescales. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 58 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY The DHS National Exercise Division engages in major emergency exercises every year\u2014 gaming out the response to such events as pande mics and earthquakes. They utilize the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC) at Sandia National Laboratory as an extensive tool set to examin e the impacts from catastrophic events. But these tools do not encapsulate real-time prediction out to S2S timescal es. We need to be prepared as a nation to anticipate, prepare, and react to such impactful events at the appropriate timescales. A framework that could encompass multiple temporal scales of impacts, while exercising state-of-the-science models, could prep are agencies to collaborate and respond in the event of a catastrophic/unprecedented incident. Such incide nts that could produce sustained regional-to- global impacts beyond several week s duration include volcano erupti ons and forest fires/biomass burning. THE WAY FORWARD FOR RE ALIZING THE POTENTIAL OF S2S PREDICTIONS Even though user needs are not fully articulate d at this point and re side mostly in case studies and anecdotal information, it is clear that there is much potential value in developing S2S forecasts. However, decision makers need a wide r range of model and forecast variables than what is generally available at present. Producing forecast products that are valid at finer spatial and temporal scales, and generati ng event- and impact-based info rmation, are some of the most commonly expressed needs. For example, knowing the probability of receiving an abnormally high number of heat events during a summer can help local and state emergency management officials prepare resources to minimize impacts. Advances in S2S predictions, which will be described in Chapters 4 and 5, will provide opportunities to advance from basic products an d provide both finer spatial and temporal resolution and additional variables that are not pr esently available to most end users. Some of these specialized products will continue to be created off-line, through techniques such as downscaling of S2S forecasts, coupling S2S forecas ts with sector-specific dynamic or decision models, such as in the case of predictions of piracy activity (Figur e 3.5), or seasonal hydrology forecasts to inform water management. Such spec ialized products do already provide some of the needed capabilities, but access to such products is limited, as developing derived products can be costly. Decision makers may also benefit from an ability to run on-demand simulations to respond to unanticipated events. This could be us eful in responding to an event or it may be useful in generating scenarios th at can be used in a planning context. A capability of using similar models to those used to make operati onal predictions can allow decision makers the flexibility of generating a range of scenarios. For example, forecas ts of a range of ocean currents and surface winds can help decision makers antic ipate where to deploy resources for containing an oil spill, or possible outc omes of a volcanic eruption. However, advancing effective use of S2S information requires both \"knowledge of\" and \"knowledge in\" the process (c.f., Lasswell (1971) discussion of the policy process). Knowledge in the process focuses on mechanisms that pr omote the use of S2S information, including understanding product requirements as described a bove, evaluation metrics, and integration into operational systems. Knowledge of the process includes research on decision-making processes and contexts that promote or inhibit the use of information. These can roughly be thought of as a need to understand use and a need to promote use. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 3: Enhancing the Value and Benefits of S2S Forecasts 59 PREPUBLICATION COPY An essential first step is improving unders tanding of what stakeholders view as actionable information. S2S information has tr ansformative potential but the path forward towards application of such information is unclea r due to lack of study and synthesis of existing information. More generalized information on what end users want, which is important to help inform advances in S2S forecasts, requires more than ad hoc case studies of particular decision contexts, such as water managers' use of informa tion in a particular basi n. Case studies need to be broadened to include more sectors, the intera ction between sectors, a nd more regions of the country, in order to develop a more systematic as sessment of user needs across sectors. Such an assessment will be particularly important for developing forecasts of variables such as sea ice or harmful algal blooms that are not as readily available at the presen t time. Furthermore, quantification of the valu e of use of seasonal forecasts is need ed to establish a baseline against which improvements in use can be measured. The S2S community also needs to learn more about decision makers' tolerances for use of products with limited skill. Under what conditions are deci sion makers willing to accept limited skill and still use the products? Are they more willing to accept limited skill in the context of general guidance as compared to c oncrete decisions? How do they respond to failed forecasts? A more thorough examination of decisi on makers' tolerance for forecasts with lower skill will reveal some sectors or applications that can make effective use of present and near-term products, as well as identifying longer-term opportunities and targ ets for new products as skill improves. S2S information may be used to consult, c onsider, incorporate, or engage in dialogue about risks (A. Ray, personal communication, Ma rch 2015). Examining the decision-processes in each of these applications will enable de velopment of new products, and also drive improvements to the dissemination of such products by both the public and pr ivate sectors. It is likely that targeted products will need to be developed for a range of different sectors and decision-making contexts. Recommendation A: Develop a body of social science research that leads to more comprehensive and systematic understanding of the use and barriers to use of seasonal and subseasonal Earth system predictions. Specifically: Characterize current and poten tial users of S2S forecasts and their decision-making contexts, and identify key commonalities and differences in needs (e.g., variables, temporal and spatial scale, lead times, and forecast skill) across multiple sectors. Promote social and behavioral science rese arch on the use of probabilistic forecast information. Create opportunities to share knowledge and practices among researchers working to improve the use of predictions across weat her, subseasonal, and seasonal timescales. Realizing the full value of improvements in S2S predictions will also require engagement of end users throughout the proce ss of developing and disseminati ng forecast products. Just as the retail sector places consumers at the cente r of their research and development, decision makers who are the likely consumers of S2S information should be integrated into the research and development process. Integrating developers, providers, and users in th e context of strategic Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 60 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY planning for the S2S enterprise assures the gr owth of S2S applications and helps push the boundaries of the science of S2S prediction. An it erative engagement with users is required in part because the diversity of a pplications of S2S forecasts is large, and the science of S2S forecasting is rapidly advancing. Ongoing work will be necessary to continually match and integrate what is technologically feasible with what is most actionable for decision makers. In particular, it will be important to: 1) understand wh at variables and timescales provide the most value and opportunities; 2) unders tand how decision makers might operate within the context limited skill or high uncertainty predictions; and 3) determine th e formats and message content for products in partnership with those using thos e products. Such iterative engagement will also provide guidance to the operati onal community on the critical re search challenges, such as forecasting extreme events, and the way in which information can be most effectively delivered. As with weather forecasts, most decision make rs are likely to acquire information via an intermediary (Breuer et al., et al., 2002). There are opportunities to utilize existing programs, such as NOAA's Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments, which activ ely engage decision makers in co-production of knowledge related to needs for climate information and services. There are also numerous academic programs that promote inter-disciplinary research related to the use of climate and scientific information in societal applications. These present existing aven ues that should be built upon to examine decision making, generate deci sion-support tools, and provide guidance on future S2S research priorities, opera tional forecast products, and services. As demand for S2S products grows, there wi ll be new opportunities for research and applications, necessitating changes in the workfor ce. Blended research between the physical and social sciences will facilitate the transfer of knowledge between forecasts, outlooks and predictions of the physical environment, and thei r social applications. Growing the number of \"extension agents\" or other boundary roles and institutions should also be considered to improve the outcomes of S2S forecast use, and to better integrate decision makers into the process of developing S2S forecasts. Changes in the structur e of the workforce are discussed further in Chapter 7. Although it is important to bolster the capab ilities of operationa l centers to produce useful forecasts, it is also im portant not to neglect the private sector's role in delivering new products. S2S forecasts offer an obvious opportunity for private sector providers to transform forecasts of conventional variables into new, value-added products focused on user needs and preferences. There is an emerging private sector already providing detailed analyses needed for specialized applications. Thus private sector providers should be cl osely involved in any program for engaging stakeholders , and should be informed of th e results and conclusions of such efforts. The U.S. Small Business Innovati on Research (SBIR) program is one such a mechanism for the weather and c limate research agencies to engage the private sector in developing improvements for operational commercial offerings and to more effectively target specific user groups. Continued growth of both the private sector and the ar ray of products in the public sector are thus required to me et the growing demand for services. Recommendation B: Establish an ongoing and iter ative process in which stakeholders, social and behavioral scientists, and ph ysical scientists co-design S2S forecast products, verification metrics, and decision-making tools.

During the early developments of seasonal to interannual climat e prediction, weather prediction was often described as an \"initial-value\" pr oblem and seasonal orlonger-term climate prediction as a \"boundary-value\" problem (Box 4.1). However, as our aspirations and capabilities for providing skillful predictions ac ross timescales and Earth system components has increased, the value of such dist inctions has become limited. The schematics in Figure 4.1 are meant to furt her illustrate the above considerations and the complexities in estimating predictability across a range of timescales and phenomena (e.g., S2S) and implementing them in a forecasting system. The top schematic shows time series depicting variations in an arbitr ary quantity (e.g., temperature, pr ecipitation) that are typical of weather, subseasonal, and seas onal variability over a roughly six-month period, with an indication of what processes might be associat ed with the given variation and timescale (e.g., green ~ Madden-Julian Oscillation [MJO], soil mo isture). The bottom schematic is similar but for longer timescale variations. For weather fore casting, the forecast proceeds from an observed initial state (solid blue circle ) out to lead times of a few days. For subseasonal or seasonal forecasts, the same is true out to a few week s or months, respectively. Along the lines of the discussion above, the influence on weather or S2S forecasts from the sorts of (long timescale) phenomena indicated in the lower schematic c ould feasibly be provided as a fixed boundary value. However, this practical separation be tween processes and times cales is not always possible or straightforward, particul arly as the different timescales become closer. In fact, filling the forecast capability gap between the weather (initial value) and the seasonal (previously referred to as boundary value) problems with subseas onal capabilities has se rved to strongly blur the perception that they are sepa rate sorts of forecast \"problems\" and helped to instigate the desire for \"seamless\" forecasting system s (e.g., Palmer et al., 2008, see Box 5.2).

Put anothe r way, virtually every prediction problem of the natural weather/climate system is, in its purest and most comprehensive form, an \"initial-value\" problem. However, the practicalities of producing a forecast ne arly always also include the application of the \"boundary-value\" paradigm in one form or another, which arises from one of three practical reasons. In one case, an incomplete knowledge or model of the stat e or evolution of a given process necessitates that the representation of that component/process be sp ecified (or approximated) as a fixed boundary condition to the part of the system that is being m odeled and forecasted. An example of this might be how sea ice was treated in the first global weather forecast s. Although there was reason to think that sea ice could evolve and influence weather patterns over the course of the forecast, there did not exist the process knowledge, associated models, and observations to accu rately include it in a manner that would improve the forecast. Thus, it was of necessity in that case to provide a fixed specification (i.e. a \"boundary value\") for the distribution of sea ice and not expl icitly include its interaction in the forecast. The influence/interactions of vegetation in today's weather forecasts, are often treated similarly, i.e., there is reason to think they influence key wa ter and energy processes relevant to the weather and climate, but the process models and associated observations for initia lization are too incomplete to include in an operational forecast setting. The a bove considerations are important because as long as a process is relegated to a boundary condition, the estimate of the predictability of that phenomenon is incomplete or at least compromised, even though it might be key to the fidelity of a modeled or forecast phenomenon. In the second case, there may be a skillful and effi cient model of a process relevant to a forecast and even observations that could be utilized to initia lize the relevant quantities. However, because of a relatively slower evolution of that component of the system, it is both feasible and advisable to simply specify the values for that part of the system fro m observations, leaving them as constant \"boundary- values\" for the forecast period. Examples of this case might be the specification of the solar forcing, greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosols, ice sheet and gl acier coverage, etc. Note that a skillful prediction of any of these quantities is in itself an \"initial-valu e problem.\" But when it co mes to a shorter timescale forecast (e.g., weather or S2S forecasts) or an associ ated estimate of predictability, it is an excellent approximation to simply consider them as \"boundary-values.\" The third case is a hybrid of the first two. Fo r cases where the coupled interaction between two Earth system components or processes is weak, the knowledge of the coupling between the two is incomplete, or there are technical challenges yet to be overcome in fully coupling the two working component models, it is often the case that a forecast model for one of the components will be produced and the values from it supplied as \"boundary-values\" to the forecast model of the other component. The most salient example of this was the use of dynamical seasonal forecasts first developed from the growing knowledge that El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related tropical sea surface temperature (SST) variations. The SST variations had a substantive im pact on the seasonal climate anomalies in the tropics and some mid-latitude regions. In this case, our early dynamical ocean model forecasts of tropical SSTs were initialized and run to lead times of 3-12 months to produce future estimates of tropical SST anomalies. These SSTs\u2014forecast as an initial valu e problem\u2014were in turn used as the SST boundary conditions to global atmospheric forecast models run over the same lead times to produce a seasonal climate forecast. In this case, the atmospheric initial condition informa tion that strongly influences 5-day weather forecast outcomes become irrelevant afte r the first month and only the SSTs, provided as \"boundary values\", dictated the climate forecast outco me. This particular example is when/where the short-term climate prediction problem became str ongly equated to a \"boundary-value\" problem, whereas in actuality the underlying and evolving tropical SST (i .e., ENSO) portion of the forecast is an \"initial- value problem\" of an ocean model (e.g., a \"two-tier\" forecast system\u2014see Chapter 2). A related example is air quality forecasting, which often utilizes the temp erature, humidity, pressure, and flow fields from a Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Theoretica lly, this is inherent to the phenom enon itself and its limit comes from inevitable errors in initial conditions, whic h are amplified through non linear processes in a perfect model. Practically, pr edictability can only be estimated through various means using empirical or numerical models th at are not perfect (NRC, 2010b). Such models can lead to over or under estimates of predictability. For exam ple, by not adequately accounting for \"noise\" relative to the specific phenomenon (i.e., the \"s ignal\"), models will often over estimate predictability. Similarly, if the specific phenomenon is only weakly represented, models will often underestimate its predictability. A firm esti mate of the lower bound of predictability is the upper limit on the observed forecast skill of opera tional systems. Achieving the upper limit of predictability with a prediction system is hindere d by practical factors. In addition to a lack of accurate specification of the initi al conditions (typically due to inadequate observation sampling in space, time, and physical quantity), there ar e shortcomings in forecast systems (typically limited by models with too coar se spatial resolution and inco mplete or inaccurate physical process representations) and shortcomings in th e data assimilation systems (see Chapter 5). For the purposes of this report and the associated research agenda, it is critical to explore and quantify the predictability of various component s of the Earth system, especially weather and climate. The estimated upper bounds of predictab ility for the various phenomena and processes discussed in this chapter ar e key to identifying unexploited or undere xploited prediction capabilities and providing a quan tified means to measure our progr ess in practical forecast skill against our predictability (i.e., upper limit) esti mates (e.g., Figure 4.2). Together these help to prioritize areas of research and model developmen t across the range of sources of predictability to pursue. PREDICTIBILITY RESEARCH Research on predictability and its sources is a central part of carving a path to new and improved forecast capabilities (e.g., S2S). Advancements in this research critically hinge on observations, a variety of models, forecast system analogs, and ensemble retrospective forecast datasets. Such research typically begins with theoretical consid erations or empirical analysis based on observations (Figure 4.3, Facet I; e.g., a lagged correlation analysis between two or more variables) that point to a process or phe nomena that exhibits pred ictability. From this perspective, it is essential to have long-records of multi-variate observations for both the predicted and the potential pr edictor(s). Often predictabil ity of a particular observed phenomenon is investigated through process-oriented studies using a hierarchy of models (Figure 4.3, Facet II). Models used for this purpose may be reduced order or idealized. In other cases researchers may create a series of sensitivity expe riments in complete Earth system models or make intercomparisons across models. Further advancement (Figure 4.3, Facet III) is made by the development of robust models that incorporate the physical rela tionships underlying the phenomena or coupled interactions that yield the predictability, as demonstrated by simu lation or retrospective forecast experiments that are evaluated against observations. Such m odel development generally requires additional targeted process observations, research and an alysis in order to properly understand the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Such resear ch is also critical gui ding model and forecast system development and helping identify obs erving systems for sustained observations. A useful technique to estimate predictability is the analysis of variance (ANOVA). An atmospheric variable, such as air temperatur e or precipitation, may be decomposed into a predictable component (signal) and an unpredic table component (noise), Z = Zs + Zn. The predictable signal comes from sources of predicta bility such as those discussed in the next section, and the unpredictabl e noise comes from chaotic processe s with respect to S2S, such as high-frequency eddies. The total variance is then the sum of the signal variance and the noise variance i.e., Var(Z)=Var(Zs)+Var(Zn). The exte nt to which the signal variance, Var(Zs), exceeds the noise variance, Var(Zn), determines the potential predicta bility. Thus potential predictability can be defined as the ratio of si gnal variance to the total variance, Var(Zs)/Var(Z), or the ratio of signal to noise, Var(Zs)/Var(Zn). In S2S, forecasts averaged over a period of a week, a month or a season, are usually produced. Such time averaging can increase the signal-to- noise ratio, as it reduces high-fr equency noise variance while keeping most of the slow-varying signal variance, and thus improve predictability. Estimates of predictability with ANOVA can be performed using observational data (Facet I of Fi gure 4.3) or with ensemble model integrations (or retrospective forecasts) (F acet II of Figure 4.3). For exam ple, Madden (1976) estimated weather noise variance of seasonal means by extr apolating the power spectrum derived from observed daily time series in a season. In the ca se of dynamical ensemble retrospective forecast, the ensemble mean represents the \"predictable signal component\", as it is independent of the uncertainties (in initial conditi on or model parameter). On the other hand, the difference among the members of the ensemble retrospective foreca st (spread) represents the \"unpredictable noise component\". This ANOVA approach has been a pplied in many previous studies to assess predictability (e.g., Quan et al., 2004; Straus et al., 2003; Zwiers, 1996). Estimates of predictability of a given process or phenomenon when accounting for (unavoidable) uncertainties in th e initial conditions a nd model configurations can also be done from \"twin experiments\" or an ensemble of e xperiments where one of the ensemble members is considered truth (or the \"observed\" state) a nd the other member(s)\u2014which only differ by some small perturbation in the initial conditions and/ or model parameters\u2014are used to predict it. These predictability estimates can then be put into the same context as retrospective forecast experiments that instead compare the same predic tions to observations in order to quantify forecast skill. This is the type of prediction ski ll and predictability experi mentation that is shown in Figure 4.2. One of the main messages from this figure is that the prac tical forecast capabilities are still far from what might be achieved given the associated estimat es of predictability (i.e., at least 2-3 weeks of additional le ad time might be possible). An additional message is that predictability estimates are model dependent, as stated earlier. Further re search and exploration can be performed with this type of system of experimentation thr ough categorizing results by season or the conditions of other portions of the climate system (e.g., warm or cold ENSO state). In summary, predictability resear ch is critical for helping to id entify and prioritize advancements between the various phenomena and Earth syst em components that might impact/offer S2S predictability, as well as guiding model and fore cast system development and helping identify observing systems for su stained observations.

These serve to guide model and forecast system developments with practica l targets for forecast skill. Further research on predictability is needed to more complete ly identify sources and quantify levels of predictability, including interactions across scales and phenomena and how these impact predictability of extreme events. SOURCES OF PREDICTIBILITY As illustrated in Figure 4.1, pr edictability derives from a number of processes and phenomena that exhibit a wide range of timescal es. For the purpose of this discussion, these sources will be generalized into three types. 14 The first occurs in the form of recurring and/or quasi-oscillatory patterns of va riability\u2014often referred to as \"modes\" of variability\u2014 that vary with S2S timescales. When a space -time pattern of variability te nds to reoccur in the observed record, particularly when it includes positive and negative phases and/or space-time propagation of the given pattern, it is often referred to as a natural \"mode\" of variability. Attempts are made to understand the physics behind th e pattern(s) and the e volution of a typical event life cycle for such modes. Dipole (IO D). Referring to Figure 4.1, this type of S2S predictability would be exhibited as a qua si-oscillatory phenomena with a period ranging somewhere between about two weeks to a year (based on this report's definition of S2S). The second source of predictability occurs from an anomaly in the in itial state of one of the components of the Earth system whose typica l timescale of evolution (i.e., persistence time) is similar to the target forecast. For the S2S tim escale, this might be la rge-scale anomalies in upper ocean heat content, sea ice, snowpack, so il moisture, etc. Given their relatively slow variation compared to weather, su ch anomalies are said to retain \"memory\" of the initial state and impart \"inertia\" to the system's subsequent evolution. They typically have a systematic or recurring manner of evolving on timescales much longer than the forecast. For the purposes of this discussion, we refer to thes e as \"slowly varying processes.\" The third type of predictability stems from anomalous external forc ing that is extensive or strong enough to have an impact globally or regionally for weeks to months (such as cyclic or anomalous solar output, anthropogeni c factors, and events such as volcanoes). In this case, its predictability in relation to S2S is derived fr om a combination of being able to specify the anomalous external forcing and the forcing evolvi ng relatively slowly or in a well-defined way over the forecast lead times (for example the annual cycle of solar radiation). Understanding and being able to model the dynamics of each of these three types of predictability sources, as well as their interactio ns and teleconnections, is essential to generating S2S forecasts. Although much progress has b een made in recent years in furthering understanding of how some of these sources of pr edictability, such as th e MJO or soil moisture, influence environmental conditions or events that forecasters would like to be able to predict (e.g., precipitation anomalies, heat waves, or tropical cyclones), more work is needed and continued progress in this area remains fundame ntal to advancing S2S predictions (e.g., NRC, 2010b; Vitart et al., 2014). Indeed large gaps remain in our understa nding of sources of 14 Using an analog from basic physics, these three types ca n very loosely be equated to a harmonic oscillator, a strongly damped harmonic oscillator and a forced harmonic oscillator.

Each of the sub-sections below describes progress and gaps in understanding the three types of predictability important for S2S prediction\u2014natural modes of va riability, slowly varying proc esses, and external forcing. Predictability from Natural Modes of Variability Natural modes of variability display distinct and organized patterns that are typically oscillatory or cyclic in some fashion, or at least bimodal with the given \"mode\" having a tendency to occur with an anom aly pattern of one sign or its opposite (e.g., see Figure 4.4). The \"modes\" are typically identifie d in a given field (e.g., SST, 500 hPa heights, 200 hPa zonal winds) but are correlated to impacts on, or interac tions with, other features in the Earth system, such as temperature, precipitation, drought, bio- productivity, ozone, etc. These modes of natural variability are characterized by dynamical inte ractions within or across Earth system components. A canonical example of a coupled mode of variability is ENSO. When these modes have life cycle lengths similar to S2S forecasts(e .g., 2 weeks to 12 months), their characteristic evolution offer a source of S2S predictability (F igure 4.1). For such cases, it is imperative that the forecast system be able to accu rately represent the mode of vari ability and its life cycle. If the life cycle is much longer than the S2S timescale, then practically speaking for the purpose of the S2S forecast, the mode's variation would likely be considered a \"slowly varying process\". Natural modes of variability are often associated with teleconnection properties that relate variability at one locatio n to conditions in another. For ex ample, the mechanisms that produce ENSO occur and evolve in the tropical Pacific Ocean, yet influence mid-latitude variability through atmospheric dynamics. As a result, the sign, strength, and frequency of occurrence of known patterns of extratropical atmospheric circulation (such as the Pacific North America pattern, PNA) partly depend on ENSO (e.g., Zhang et al., 1997). Atmospheric patterns are in turn important drivers of winter w eather and climate over North America. Some of the more well recognized natural modes of vari ability already found to or exp ected to be important for S2S predictability are discussed in more detail below, with specific attention to areas that are ripe for or in need of further research. A large part of the signal for S2S weather a nd climate predictions have tropical origins (NRC, 2010b). Through relativel y long-lived SST anomalies (e.g., ENSO, IOD) systematic flows (e.g., wave-like moti ons, MJO, Kelvin waves), large-scale storm systems become highly organized and produce systematic variations in atmospheric heating. This excites circulation anomalies that have local impacts on rainfall and temperature in the tropics but that also \"propagate\" to the extra-tropics vi a sequences of circulati on anomalies of alternate sign, often referred to as \"waves\" (Horel and Wallace, 1981; Trenberth et al., 1998). The remote impact is referred to as a teleconnection, in this case connecting variabil ity in the tropics to middle- and high-latitude weather.

Recent work has advan ced our understanding of ENSO's impact on predictability, the impacts of a number of distinct types of EN SO events, and ENSO's decadal and longer timescale change. For example, there are lagged impacts of ENSO on predictability of the Indian Ocean in summer. In the summer af ter a positive ENSO first emerges, the tropical Pacific SST returns to normal, but the Indian Ocean SST is anomalously high, with a strong suppression of tropical cyclones and impacts on te mperature and precipitation across Southeast Asia and Japan (Chowdary et al., 2011; Kosaka et al., 2013). Despite the large body of existing work on ENSO, there are important gaps relate d to understanding both ENSO and its influence on S2S predictability (McPhaden, 2015). For example, there is neither consensus on a theory nor agreement on the predictability limit of ENSO . Recent work shows that variations in the structures and seasonal timing of ENSO strongly affect the persiste nce and predictability (Lee et al., 2014), as well as ENSO teleconnections (Capot ondi et al., 2014). In recent decades, the SST anomalies in El Ni\u00f1o events have often peaked in the central Pacific rather than the more typical location of the past in the eastern Pacific. Wh ether such ENSO diversity is a consequence of greenhouse warming, and hence the recent shift can be expected in the future, is also unclear (Cai et al., 2015; Capot ondi et al., 2014). MJO The MJO, also discussed in detail in the NRC (2010b) ISI report, is the dominant mode of intraseasonal variability in tropical convection, precipitation, and circulation. Through its local influences in the tropics and its teleconnections to higher latitude s, it represents a primary source of predictability at the subseasonal timescale (e.g., Waliser, 2011). The MJO is mainly an atmospheric phenomenon, but it also exhibits some modest interactions with the upper ocean\u2014 both in forcing and responding to coupled SST an omalies and exciting ocean currents and waves. It exhibits planetary-scale stru ctures along the equator in pres sure, winds, clouds, rainfall, and many other variables, with its st rongest anomalies in precipitation propagating from the Indian to central Pacific Oceans over a period of about 30 - 50 days. An eight phase index for MJO, referred to as the Real-time Multivariate MJO (RMM1 and RMM2) indices of Wheeler and Hendon, are usually used to describe the east-west location and amplitude of the MJO (Wheeler and Hendon, 2004). See NRC (2010b), Lau and Waliser (2011), a nd Zhang (2005) for further description. The MJO has been shown to have significan t connections to a number of important global weather and climate phenomen a, including high impact even ts (e.g., see reviews in Lau and Waliser, 2011; Zhang, 2005, 2013). This includes a strong influence on the onset and breaks of the Asian and Australian summer monsoons and on the modulation of synoptic variability\u2014 including tropical cyclones\u2014and even the triggering of ENSO variations. Improving representation of the MJO in globa l models has led to better pred iction on S2S timescales at high latitudes as well as in the tr opics (e.g., Ferranti et al. 1990; Vitart, 2014). For example, North American wintertime surface temperatures are fo und to be anomalously warm 10-20 days after MJO-related convection occurs in the Indian Ocea n (Lin and Brunet, 2009) (Figure 4.5). Such a lagged relationship implies predictability of Nort h American temperature anomalies up to about three weeks given knowledge of the initial state of the MJO.

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 4: Sources of Subseasonal to Seasonal Predictability 75 PREPUBLICATION COPY Extratropical Modes Extratropical weather is fre quently dominated by recurri ng circulation patterns, often referred to as weather regimes or extratropical m odes of variability. Becaus e of their large-scale and low-frequency nature, thes e circulation patterns can contribute to atmospheric S2S predictability. For example, it has long been reco gnized that the Pacific - North American pattern (PNA), has a significant impact on the North Am erican surface air temperature and precipitation (e.g., Wallace and Gutzler, 1981). Although the state of the PNA and its predictability on S2S timescales is influenced by ENSO (Zhang et al., 1997) and MJO (Mor i and Watanabe, 2008) variability, it is unclear how in teractions between these coupled modes and/or additional drivers may influence PNA variability and its associated w eather patterns. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is anothe r major circulation patte rn that influences weather from eastern North America to Europe, a nd it is highly correlated with the Northern Annular Mode (NAM). The NAO/NAM exhibits pr edictability on S2S timescales because its variability is linked to ot her components of the Earth system th at are more predictable, such as the stratospheric polar vortex. Observational studies also s how a robust lagged connection between the MJO and NAO (Cassou, 2008; Lin et al., 2009), and indeed a higher level of skill in predicting the NAO on a subseas onal timescale can be achieve d when a strong MJO signal occurs in the initial conditi on (Lin et al., 2010). Similarly, skillful seasonal NAO predictions have been made by improving the in itialization procedure to more r ealistically capture the initial state of the QBO and ocean and sea ice conditions (Scaife et al., 2014b). It follows that forecasts of the NAM have also been found to be skillful on seasonal timescale a nd that this skill was improved through more realistic ini tialization (Riddle et al., 2013). Understanding and correctly representing phenomena like the NAO/NAM, the PNA and the Southern Annual Mode (SAM) in the southern hemisphere are additionally important for S2S predictions because their state can influence the development of strong and persistent anomalies in midlatitude atmospheric circulations that are sometimes caused by blocking events. Blocking can be exploited as a source of predictability (Hoskins and Woollings, 2015) and has been linked to high impact weather such as severe cold spe lls in winter and droughts in summer. Variability in the NAO has been related to blocking episod es (Woollings et al., 2008), and as the NAO has proved to be more predictable than previously thought, so ha s blocking (Athanasiadis et al., 2014). Future Directions on how Modes of Va riability Influence Predictability Natural modes of variability represent key sources of S2S predictability. Although much progress has been made in understanding these modes, in particular ENSO and MJO, less is known about the how the interac tions between coupled modes and slowly varying processes influence the development of specific environm ental conditions. Con tinued research into variability in coupled modes, a nd their interactions across times cales, is necessary in order to fully exploit their predictability for S2S for ecasting. Important questions that need to be addressed include: How does the MJO influence ra infall over southeast Asia during El Ni\u00f1o vs. La Ni\u00f1a, or in different phases of the Indian Ocean Dipole? How do tropical Kelvin and other atmospheric waves influence the initiation, am plitude, or decay of the MJO?

Th ese sorts of investigations fall under Facet I in Figure 4.3. Moreover, as correlations between these modes and impactful weather/climate are discovered, it is essential that our models can re-create such variability and its impact in simulations and retrospective forecast experime nts (i.e., Facet II and III in Figure 4.3). For example, some models do quite well at repres enting intraseasonal variability in the eastern Pacific\u2014which has a strong impact on tropical cyclones in that area\u2014while others perform relatively poorly (Jiang et al., 2012a; Jiang et al., 2012b). Many such examples are evident from the literature where empirical anal ysis has indicated potential rela tionships that can be exploited for S2S predictability, yet models still struggle to represent the variability and relationships correctly. These include IOD and boreal summer monsoon interactions (Ajayamohan et al., 2009), Kelvin wave and MJO interactions (Guo et al., 2015), and many others. Of particular challenge are those modes of variability that st em from coupled processes, including ENSO, but that could also include land-atmosphe re or cryosphere-atmosphere coupling. Finally, as our models become more capable of representing these processes, it is critical to carry out the predictability experimentation described above a nd highlighted as Facet IV in Figure 4.3. Such experimentation can point to forecasting system research and development avenues that would yield the greate st benefits and help to identi fy and/or characterize forecasts of opportunity based on specific modes of variability being in a particular phase (e.g., when the MJO is in phase 4-5 there is a strong enhan cement of tropical cyclones to the west of the maritime continent and a suppression of them to the east). Finding 4.2: Natural modes of variability represen t key sources of S2S predictability, and it is essential that S2S models accurately represent th em. Further research is needed especially to understand the interaction of natural modes across timescales, associated impacts on teleconnection patterns, and the formation of extreme environmental conditions. Long and sustained observational records are essential for such research. Predictability from Slowly Varying Processes As discussed briefly above, S2S predictability can stem from persistence in the initial state of various components of the Earth system. For example, anomalous conditions in the stratosphere or ocean can persist for several mont hs owing to their vertical stability and slowly overturning circulation. In addi tion, persistence in anomalous environmental conditions often stems from storage of anomalous energy, typically in the form of heat or water in a given phase, such as in snow, sea ice, soil moisture, or ocean heat content. For example, the heat capacity of the entire atmosphere column is about the sa me as just the top 2.5 m of the ocean, and the melting of a global 25 cm shell of ice would take as much energy as warming the entire atmosphere by 10\u00b0C. When these anomalous stores of heat occur on larg e spatial scales (e.g., greater than ~1,000s of kilometers ), their evolution/dissipation t ypically occur on timescales of several days, weeks, or months and thus provide predictability to the Earth system. Smaller anomalies may also provide predic tability for important ocean and coastal properties that are of interest to predict in their ow n right. Similarly, anomalies in momentum (e.g., ocean currents or atmospheric circulation patterns), aerosols a nd chemical species, and phytoplankton can also instill slow and anomalous varia tions on the coupled Earth system, impacting the ability to make skillful S2S forecasts.

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 4: Sources of Subseasonal to Seasonal Predictability 77 PREPUBLICATION COPY Sometimes persistence is used as a threshold for predictive skill, which does not preclude considering persistence as a source of predictability. By the Committee's definition, a phenomenon can exhibit predictability even if it is can be predicted with an idealized model or theoretical means. Furthermore, the threshold fo r predictive skill must itself have a source of predictability. Even so, the probability of a phe nomena occurring due to persistence in a system with many interacting processes may not be possi ble to predict with an idealized model or theoretical means, and may require a pred ictive system, even though the mechanism for predictability at some level appears basic and might not be considered \"dynamical.\" Additional details of a number of slowly varying processes with in the coupled Earth system that provide predictability on S2S timescales are provided below. Ocean Given the ocean's relatively la rger heat capacity compared to other components of the Earth system and the persistence of its temperatur e, salinity, and currents, the ocean represents a key source of predictability on S2S timescales in a number of ways (NRC, 2010b). Here we focus on mechanisms involving the ocean surfac e conditions owing to their relevance for humans (e.g., fisheries, harmful algal blooms, c ontrols on the atmosphere and sea ice, etc.), rather than those that primarily affect the de ep ocean. These mechanisms include large- and small-scale ocean dynamics in the tropics (e .g., Alexander 1992) and the extratropics (e.g., Hartmann 2015), as well as ocean interactions with the atmosphere and sea ice through surface exchange of energy, moisture, and momentum, yi elding both one-way influences and coupled feedbacks. The persistence of surface anomalies depends primarily on the depth of the upper ocean mixed layer. Other secondary factors include the net surface energy and freshwater fluxes, upwelling rates (via Ekman pumping and entr the properties of upwelling subsurface waters. Anomalous upwelling driven by persistent wind regimes associated with atmospheric modes of variability can lead to predictable anomalous surface conditions because subsurface waters generally also have longer-li ved properties, including concentrations of nutrients that can drive biological productivity (e.g., Waliser et al., 2005). Subsurface anomalies may even lie \"dormant\" (unrelated to the mixed layer properties) until one or more storms with high winds mixes the upper ocean, transporting the anomaly vertically to the surface (Alexander et al., 1999). Small-scale (10s-100s of kilometers) surface ocean features, such as circular motions known as eddies and regions of strong gradients known as fronts, can also exhibit persistence for months to years (Chelton et al ., 2004; Chelton and Xie, 2010). Th ese small-scale variations in SST cause divergence and convergence in the su rface wind and vertical motions that link the small-scale ocean features to cloud properties an d other atmospheric features (e.g., Chelton and Xie, 2010). Ocean eddies also ha ve an association with ocean biogeochemistry through their influence on upwelling or downw elling, horizontal advection, a nd isolation of nutrients and ecosystems (Gaube et al., 2014). Because of their persistence and coupling with the atmosphere (20% of the heat flux between the atmosphere an d ocean is related to the ocean eddy field [Boas et al., 2015]), these eddies repres ent a potential source of S2S pr edictability for the ocean and even the entire Earth system if feedb acks to the atmosphere are prominent.

The latter occurs due to its high albedo relative to snow-free area s; it acts as a significant surf ace heat sink via the latent heat required to melt the snow, and in changing the interface conditions it influences the fluxes of heat and moisture between the land and atmos phere. Knowledge of anomalous snow conditions, particularly the snow water equivalent as opposed to just snow cover, can improve forecasts of air temperature and humidity, runoff, and soil mo isture during the winter and spring seasons (NRC, 2010b; Jeong et al., 2013; Pe ings et al., 2011; Thomas et al., 2015). For large-scale anomalies in snow conditions, there is also so me evidence that snow can influence remote atmospheric conditions by alteri ng large-scale atmospheric circ ulation features (e.g., Rossby waves) (also see section below on Sea Ice and Polar Land Surface). For example, correlations have been documented between autumn anomalies in Eurasian snow and the large-scale northern hemisphere atmospheric circulation a few weeks to months later through the influence of snow cover on the vertical propagation of wave energy into the stra tosphere and the NAO (Brands et al., 2012; Fletcher et al., 2007; Or solini et al., 2013; Orsolini et al., 2015). Snow cover and snow water can have a profound influence on the evoluti on of the local, regional, and even large-scale weather patterns as well as a number of Earth system components. This influence places a high priority on ensuring observations of snow are available for process understanding and forecast initialization (e.g., Orsolini et al., 2013) and that our terrestrial hydrology and atmospheric models properly represent snow and related processes (see Chapter 5). Sea Ice and Polar Land Surface Sea ice lends predictability to the Earth system because its presence strongly reduces heat and moisture fluxes from the ocean to the atmos phere, it serves as a si gnificant reservoir of freshwater within the upper o cean, and it is an excellent refl ector of solar radiation. The persistence of sea ice an omalies has several important timescales (Figure 4.7). There is an initial persistence of anomalies in the sea ice cover that varies from 2-4 months (Lemke et al., 1980), depending on the season (Blanchard-Wriggleswort h et al., 2011a; Day et al., 2014) and location (Bushuk and Giannakis, 2015). After this initial peri od of persistence, there is a reemergence that occurs in some seasons owing to sea ice intern al dynamic and coupled in teractions between sea ice and SST. Modeling studies sugge st anomalies of sea ice thickne ss are far more persistent and about as important as SST in cont rolling the persistence characteri stics of the sea ice cover (Bitz Holland et al., 2013; Lindsay et al., 2008). The lack of long- term sea ice thickness measurements forces resear chers and forecasters to turn to models to estimate these quantities. When models factor in transport, sea ice thickness anomalies can persist for almost two years and exhibit typica l length scales of about 500-1,000 km (Blanchard- Wrigglesworth and Bitz, 2014).

Finding 4.4 : It is essential to maintain and increa se observations of the slowly varying components of the Earth system relevant to S2S (e.g. snow, soil moistu re, sea ice and near- surface ocean) for the purpose of process understandi ng, model development, and to improve the initial conditions in forecast system. Furthe r studies are needed to understand the relative importance of these processes as sources of S2S predictability. Predictability from External Forcing Variability on S2S timescales may also be driven by external forcing, such as from anomalies in solar forcing, anth ropogenic emissions of pollution or aerosols, or the episodic input of aerosols from volcanoes. Advanced knowledge of change s in the radiative, thermal, biogeochemical, or hydrological forcing of some pa rt of the Earth System can lead to skillful predictions of other quantities of interest such as surface te mperature or precipitation. Two leading cycles in the Earth system, the diurnal cycle and seasonal cycle, are very predictable precisely because they are driven by highly repeating patterns in the incoming shortwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere. While thes e timescales are very rele vant to S2S variations, particularly when considering interactions across scales, it has not been a trivial matter to represent their impacts in global weather/climate forecast models. Over the last decade or so, numerical weather and climate models have started to be able to better reproduce credible seas onal variability thr ough careful representati on of the relevant processes. However, there are still significant shor tcomings in representing the effects from these very well defined external forcings that are highly relevant to S2 S prediction, such as the diurnal cycle. For example, there is potential influen ce of the diurnal cycle over the maritime continent on the MJO as it propagates eastward from the I ndian Ocean into the western Pacific Ocean. Observations exhibit a relative minimum in the MJO-driven subseasonal variability over the maritime continent, possibly because of the rela tively stronger diurnal cycle in this region relative to the open ocean to the east and west. Representing this scale interaction in models has been challenging and has represented a barrier to producing accurate fore casts of MJO amplitude and propagation in this regi on (e.g., Weaver et al., 2011) Aerosol variability in a number of forms hol ds the potential to influence variability on S2S timescales and represents an important source of S2S predictability in some cases. 15 A volcanic eruption has the potential to loft significant ash and dust into the troposphere and stratosphere, which can result in substantial anomalies in both incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation. Depending on the magnit ude of the mass injection and its altitude, the anomalous aerosol forcing can last for days to a couple of weeks in the troposphere and months to a year in the slow, st able circulation of the stratosphe re. Accurate representation of the 15 Aerosols also play a key role in cloud formation and the development of precipitation. Understanding and modeling this process accurately is critical to producing high fidelity models of the atmosphere for nearly all forecast timescales. Given its place as a key physical proce ss, rather than a source of predictability, aerosol-cloud interactions are treated in Chapter 5. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 4: Sources of Subseasonal to Seasonal Predictability 83 PREPUBLICATION COPY aerosol content, types, and inte ractions with clouds and radiat ion provides a poten tial source of predictability. Demand for realizing this forecas t potential stems from the needs to better represent and forecast its influence on weather and short-term climate as well as to better understand and predict the lifetime of the aerosol anomaly its elf and its societal impacts (e.g., how long will the ash plume last, wi ll it affect air traffic?). In some cases, ash, dust, and other aerosols can influence the Earth system even after they are removed from the atmosphere, most notably when they are deposited on ice or snowpack. In this case, they can have a substant ial influence on the subsequent evolution of the surface, producing considerably faster melting th an would otherwise be the case. This has both hydrological implications (Qian et al., 2009) via the change in the runoff and implications for the evolution of the snow pack and the manner it in fluences weather and short term climate (see section above on Slowly Varying Processes). Aeroso ls can also impart predictability on near- surface ocean biology by providing input of key nut rients, namely iron, that can facilitate the development of widespread phytoplankton blooms (Langmann et al., 2010), which have life cycles of days to weeks. Such blooms influence the vertical profile of solar absorption in the upper ocean, typically leading to greater warming of SST and a more stable surface mixed-layer than would otherwise occur (Siegel et al., 1995). The latter can have considerable implications for large-scale variations and sp atial structure of SST anomalies, which in turn can influence weather and short-term climate. While the lifetimes of other atmospheric c onstituents can be much longer, it is still critical that they be accounted for in S2S for ecast systems. Notable examples for this are the concentration of anthropogenic greenhouse gase s (GHGs, e.g., carbon dioxide, methane, etc.). The typical lifetime of anthr opogenic greenhouse gas anomalies is on the order of a decade to centuries, and fluctuations and trends in the em issions of greenhouse gases also tend to occur on timescales that are long relative to the S2S forecas t. These long timescales imply that, for a given forecast, the GHG concentration can be specified to be a cons tant. However, because multi- decade retrospective forecast datasets are a crucia l component of a S2S forecast system for bias correction (see Chapter 5), it is imperative that th e values of impactful constituents be specified to the forecast system as time-varying bounda ry condition over the time period of the retrospective forecasts. This type of slowly varyi ng forced signal can lead to systematic shifts in the probability distributions of variables (e.g., temperature and precip itation) that can be predicted given the known value of the forcing. Furthermore, such external forcing has caused the seasonal minimum of Arctic sea ice extent to decline by over 40% , radically changing the probability of where the sea ice edge lies at the end of summer in recent years compared to the beginning of the satellite record in 1979. As S2 S forecast systems encompass more Earth system components and coupled processes th at are influenced by such extern al forcing, it is important to have an accurate representation of GHG forcing a nd other slowly varying external forcing (e.g. solar constant, surface albedo). Finding 4.5: Given the requirement that S2S fo recasts have for multi-decade retrospective forecast datasets for the purposes of bias correct ion, is it imperative that the model forecast system account for all slowly varying external forcings that influence the frequency, spatial distributions, and temporal distributions of S2S forecast quantities (e.g., temperature, precipitation). Such external forcing includes the influences from natural and anthropogenic aerosol emissions, GHG concentrations, variatio ns in the solar constant, and surface albedo, where the latter may derive from snow/ice co ver or land use/land cover changes.

Similarly, an El Ni\u00f1o condi tion along with MJO phases 8 and 1 will produce subsidence and thus dry conditions over the same region. On top of mode s of variability, other processes lending predicta bility can act on the given anomaly to further exacerbate the condition. For example, wet conditions will produce positive soil moisture anomalies, which can in turn positively influence the further development of precipitation in the given region. Such timescale and process interactions, in terms of their additi ve or in some cases c ounter-acting influences, can occur in a number of places around the globe depending on the phenomena, region and season. These multi-scale interactions of an inherent, albeit intermittent, source of S2S predictability, represent \"f orecasts of opportunity\"\u2014a foundational consideration in S2S forecasting. Better understanding these interactio ns will make it possible to develop more forecasts of opportunity, e.g., forecasts that take advantage of windows of time in which higher predictability are possible. This wi ll be particularly important for the prediction of events that are of interest to decision makers. Finding 4.6 : The nature of sources of S2S predictabili ty, namely intermittent natural modes of variability, wide and often disaggregated variat ions in anomalous conditions in a number of slowly varying processes/quantities, and varied natural and anthropogenic external forcings, liken the S2S prediction challenge to the identifi cation and successful prediction of a series of \"forecasts of opportunity.\" Identifying such windows of predictability will be particularly important for forecasts of extreme and disruptive events. THE WAY FORWARD FOR RE SEARCH ON SOURCES OF PREDICTABILITY The relative value of predictability sources is dependent on location of the forecast and time of the year. While some processes have a st ronger local impact, others influence the climate through teleconnections and have a far-reaching e ffect. For example, initial anomalies in soil moisture can influence the local forecast pr ecipitation and surface air temperature through changes in surface energy budget associated with evaporation. Anomalies of tropical convection associated with ENSO and the MJO infl uence the middle latitude climate through teleconnections related to Rossby wave energy pr opagation, and thus a large impact is usually observed along the path of Rossby wave train. In the Northern Hemisphe re extratropics, the wintertime westerlies provide a more favorable background for Rossby wave propagation than in summer, thus the teleconnection contribution is stronger in winter. On the other hand, the influence of soil moisture becomes relatively more important in summer than in winter. Our understanding of the source of S2S predicta bility is still lacking. The relative value of predictability sources has not yet been establ ished. The approaches that have been used in predictability study may not be appropriate to sepa rate the contributions of different sources. For example, the specification of soil moisture in the initial condition in the retrospective forecast experiment that is designed to identify the cont ribution of soil moisture may contain information of ENSO or other sources of pr edictability. In the relaxation e xperiment that is designed to identify the origin of skill source, the analysis fields that are relaxed to in a given region may already contain variability propagating from ot her regions. The combined effect of several different sources of predictability may not be a s imple sum of individual processes. More studies are needed to understand how different sources of predictability interact. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 4: Sources of Subseasonal to Seasonal Predictability 87 PREPUBLICATION COPY Climate models that are used to do retrospe ctive forecasts are imperfect, and different models have different model er rors, leading to inaccurate, incomplete, and model-dependent estimates of signal and noise variability in ANOVA analysis, as well as false representation of the \"truth\" in the twin experiments used to estimate the upper predic tability limit. The assessment of impact of a particular proce ss on forecast skill is also model-dependent. Encouraging future studies to use a multi-model framework would help to reduce the uncertainty related to model configurations. Also, innovative methodologies to estimate predictability need to be explored in order to better und erstand the nature of S2S forecast. It is essential to maintain and increase observatio nal records for different components of the Earth system. These observations can be used to explore new sources of predictability and to better initialize S2S models. It is important fo r S2S models to capture the natural modes of variability, slow processes, and exte rnally forced trend and variability. Recommendation C : Identify and characterize sources of S2S predictability, including natural modes of variability (e.g., ENSO, MJO, QBO), slowly varyi ng processes (e.g., sea ice, soil moisture, and ocean eddies), and external forcing (e.g., aerosols), an d correctly represent these sources of predictability, including their interactions, in S2S forecast systems. Specifically: Use long-record and process-level observat ions and a hierarchy of models (theory, idealized models, high-resolution models, glob al Earth system models, etc.) to explore and characterize the physical nature of sources of predictability and their interdependencies and dependencies on th e background environment and external forcing. Conduct comparable predictability and skill estimation studies and assess the relative importance of different sources of predictabi lity and their interac tions, using long-term observations and multimodel approaches (such as the World Meteorological Organization-lead S2S Project's databa se of retrospective forecast data). Decision makers are particularly interested in guidance on the likelihood, magnitude, and impacts of disruptive events (see also Chapter 3). Prediction of these types of events will rely on identifying multi-scale interactions of inherent, al beit intermittent sources of S2S predictability. Thus prediction of such features will requi re developing \"forecas ts of opportunity\"\u2014a foundational consideration in S2S prediction. Wh ile any given extreme event (e.g., storm) is typically not predictable more than a few days in advance, understanding interactions between sources of S2S predictability offer the means to infer changes in the likelihoods of extreme events\u2014including their spatial distribution, o ccurrence frequency, magnitude, and type. More specifically, this means that an accurate S2S forecast system will provide quantitative forecast information\u2014likelihoods and uncertainties\u2014on extrem e events with lead times from weeks to months. However, it is critical that all of th e important and impactful phenomena be represented faithfully in order to yield accurate forecasts. Fo r example, based on the discussion above, if the ENSO modulation is accurately depicted by the fo recast system but there are temporal, spatial, and/or amplitude biases in the representation of the MJO, the forecast accuracy of precipitation amounts and extreme events\u2014will be heavily compromised. In summary , accurate prediction of extreme w eather/environmental events hinges critically on the accurate represen tation of all of the dominant m odes of variability and slowly Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 88 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY varying processes that operate and yield predictability on S2S timescales. Forecast models must represent these processes individually as well as collectively, with specific attention to their multi-scale interactions and influences on the development of extreme events. Thus all four facets of predictability research highlighted in Figure 4.3 need to be undertaken to improve the prediction of disruptive, high impact, or extreme events. Recommendation D: Focus predictability studie s, process exploration, model development and forecast skill advancements on high impact S2 S \"forecasts of opportunity \" that in particular target disruptive and extreme events. Specifically: Determine how predictability sources (e.g., na tural modes of variab ility, slowly varying processes, external forcing) and their multi-scale interactions can influence the occurrence, evolution, and amp litude of extreme and disruptive events using long-record and process-level observations. Ensure the relationships between disruptive and extreme weather/environmental events\u2014 or their proxies\u2014and sources of S2S predicta bility (e.g., modes of na tural variability and slowly varying processes) are repr esented in S2S forecast systems. Investigate and estimate the predictability a nd prediction skill of disruptive and extreme events through utilization and further development of forecast and retrospective forecast databases, such as those from the S2S Project and the NMME.

After those sources are identified and begin to be understood, they can be incorporated into Earth system models for subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) prediction. This chapter examines the features of such S2S prediction systems and makes recommendations about advancing each component in order to produce more skillful S2S forecasts. To be gin, the chapter provides an overview of the functioning architecture of a typical S2S system. The production of probabilistic forecasts on S2S timescales is similar in many ways to contemporary numerical weather prediction: observations of th e atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and land provide initial conditions for compu ting the evolution of these Earth system components forward in time. But there are some important differences between S2S and shorter- term weather and ocean prediction. First, chaotic aspects of the Earth system mandate averaging S2S predictions over long enough periods, or over a large enough set of rea lizations, that stable forecast statistics are produced for each place and lead time. Longer and/or larger-ensemble averages are generally needed fo r longer lead times. A second diffe rence is that a set of similar forecasts\u2014made in retrospect for 20 or more y ears with the same foreca st system\u2014is typically compared with verification observations to calibrate the forecasts, with the aim of correcting the predicted probability distribution on the basis of how the model reproduces past conditions. This is crucial and standard practice at least at seas onal timescales (where the desired signals may be small compared to the corrections ); similar methods are beginning to spread to extended range Numerical Weather Predic tion (NWP). Finally, the longer-times cale predictions typically include interactive Earth system components (e.g., interactiv e ocean and sea ice), si nce the evolutions of these components have important impacts on the at mosphere or provide valuable forecasts in their own right. For weather and climate, the di stinctions among predicti on methods at various time ranges are beginning to diminish as even sh ort- to medium-range weather forecast models move to encompass interactive ocean and sea ice components. The basic architecture of S2S prediction syst ems is depicted in Figure 5.1, which also provides an organizational structur e for the content in this chapte r. Coupled Earth system models (ESMs) lie at the core of most of these system s. The ESM itself\u2014a system of partial differential equations that describe the evolution of the comp onents of the Earth system and the interactions between them\u2014projects state variables forward in time. The separate components\u2014atmosphere, ocean, land, sea ice\u2014are discretized on a computati onal grid with specific spatial and temporal resolutions. The components are linked together at the interfaces via a coupler, which transfers information, such as heat and momentum fluxes. Meanwhile, the coupler also transfers model errors from one component to another, making th e model error growth a coupled process as well. Due to the finite resolution in space and time, many processes in the models remain unresolved and require parameterizations of their effect s on the components that are resolved. The Committee notes that for certain S2S predictions , integrating a subset of an ESM can be sufficient to achieve useful predictive skill. Fo r example, some ocean and ice forecasts can be issued on S2S timescales with prescribed at mospheric surface conditions without two-way Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Running the ESM forward from an initial condition, with no further data assimilation, produces a forecast. The numerical output from an ESM forecast usually consists of an ensemble of ten or mo re members, each containing some 100 or more physical variables on spatial gr ids at intervals of hours (o r much shorter for specific applications). The ensemble is created by runni ng multiple realizations , perturbing the initial conditions and/or the model formulation, to produ ce a distribution of results that are intended to sample uncertainties in the estimate of th e initial state, extern al forcing, and model parameterizations. In order for these outputs to be transformed into S2S forecast products, they first must be calibrated and verified by comparing forecasts to the subsequent observations. To obtain a large enough data set to be statistically meaningful a nd avoid over-fitting, comp rehensive retrospective forecasts or hindcasts16 are performed in which the forecast system is exercised over a historical period of some 10 to 30 years. In this process, the reanalysis in Fi gure 5.1 provides initial conditions, the retrospective forecasts are comput ed with the ESM, and then the forecasts are compared to a reanalysis or some other verification data set. After any part of the forecast system is ch anged, the retrospective forecasts must be recreated to be consistent with the modificat ions. Today, some forecast centers are producing them as part of the model forecast process itself . This permits the centers to take advantage of model improvements with frequent updates. Thus some retrospective forecasts are static and some are produced \"on the fly\" along with the forecasts themselves. Such on-the-fly retrospective forecasts have been employed in atmospheric models and ESMs (e.g. MacLachlan et al., 2015; Vitart, 2013) and also real-time o cean forecasting (e.g. Lermusiaux et al., 2011; Ramp et al., 2009; Robinson et al ., 2002). Either way, calibrations derived from the retrospective forecasts are applied to improve new forecasts. Fo r example, if August temperature in a specific geographic region of the historical forecasts tends to be biased, then the mean temperature of the new forecasts is adjusted accordingly. Similarly, if the probability distribution of the retrospective forecast is too narrow, then the probability can be made wider in subsequent operational forecasts. The rest of this chapter examines in more de tail the pieces of S2S prediction systems that were described in brief above. Aspects of S2 S forecast systems\u2014routine observations, data assimilation, models, and the calibration and pr oduction of forecast products\u2014are covered in separate Chapter sections. For each of these sections, the Committee has identified findings and developed a set of research recommendations. The implementation of these recommendations will be critical to advancing S2S forecast skill and to better meeting the needs of users as highlighted in Chapter 3. ROUTINE OBSERVATIONS AND THEIR USE Observations are a fundamental building bloc k of any prediction system. They provide a basis for understanding the Earth system, guide model development, enable the initialization of forecast systems, and provide the foundation fo r evaluating model fidelity and quantifying prediction skill.

However, mainta ining this network to ensure no degradation of present-day nascent S2S forecast skill represents a significant challenge in and of itself. Improved utilization of other existing observati ons, along with new observations to increase geographic coverage, spatial and temporal resolution, and the br eadth of routinely measured Earth system variables, are critical for further advancing S2S model development and operational S2S forecasts. This section describes the current state of observations to support S2S forecast systems and highlights important gaps and vulnerabilities in the coverage of observational networks. The focus is on observations for operational model initialization, calibration, evaluation, and routine monitoring, though these types of obser vations are also generally usef ul for studies on sources of predictability (covered in Chapter 4). Genera lly the most basic quantities are needed (e.g., temperature, wind speeds, etc.), with continuous temporal and broad spatial coverage, and at spatial and temporal resolutions that are rele vant for S2S processes. Because S2S forecast systems are often driven by observations of an omalies from a climatological mean, overlapping measurements between successive generations of observing systems are particularly valuable so that changing observation system biases are not aliased into estimated anomalies in the state of the real world. Observations of the atmosphere ar e important for S2S prediction as they are with NWP. However, observations of the ocean, land, and cryosphere represen t additional critical needs for building, calibrating, init ializing, and evaluating the coupled ESMs that will be used to generate S2S forecasts in the next decade. This is because while the ocean, land surface, and cryosphere contain important s ources of Earth system predictability on S2S timescales, observations within these components are neither as numerous nor as distributed as observations of the atmosphere. Recommendations and prioriti es for observations to support S2S forecast systems follow at the end of the section. Field observations for process studies designed to develop and improve model processes and parameterizat ions and reduce systematic biases are covered in more detail in the modeling section of this chapter. Observations of the Atmosphere The current observing system for the atmosphe re is among the most comprehensive of all the components of the Earth system. Yet observati ons of the atmosphere need to be maintained or advanced for continued improvement to S2 S prediction systems. The current atmospheric observing system includes in situ measurements of moisture, temperature, pressure, and wind from radiosondes, aircraft (e.g., Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay [AMDAR] and Tropospheric Airborne Meteorol ogical Data Reporting [TAMDAR]) , and sensors at the Earth surface (land, moorings, and ship). Satellites provide additional information on ocean surface winds (covered in more detail in the ocean observation section), clouds and precipitation, radiation, surface temperature, winds (from feature tracking), and ve rtical profiles of temperature and moisture. These measurements come from a range of sensors including microwave radars, radiometers and sounders, hyperspectral infrared sounders, visible and infrared imagers, scatterometers, and GPS radio occultation. The world radiosonde network is extensive (F igure 5.2) and has been a main source of three-dimensional input to atmospheric models. Th ese data have historically been supplemented by measurements from aircraft-based sensors. Ho wever, the radiosonde ne twork lacks coverage Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

High altit ude and finer-resolution vertical profiles could be used to help resolve troposphere-s tratosphere interaction, cumulus convection, and mesoscale atmospheric organizati on\u2014processes that are particularly important for S2S predictions (See Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, models section). Implementing this type of change has remained challenging because of th e extensive internationa l coordination and data management it requires. Gaps in the coverage of radiosonde observa tions, along with the re cent deterioration of the radiosonde network (NRC, 2000), have led to increasing reliance on satellite data for atmospheric monitoring and modeling. Toda y, the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) is actually the most impor tant observing system for shor ter-term weather predictions in a current version of the NASA GEOS-5 globa l NWP model, followed closely by aircraft, radiosondes, and hyperspectral infrared sounders such as the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and the At mospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) (Figure 5.3). This finding is generally representative of other NWP systems such as NCEP (Ota et al., 2013) and ECMWF (Cardinali, 2009). Given the uncertainties about the future of the radiosonde network and gaps in its coverage, continued investment into satellite-based atmospheri c observations is important for moving forward. The development of platform s and algorithms for th e retrieval of key variables\u2014including vertical prof iles of temperature, humidit y, and wind\u2014at resolutions that can capture the development and evolution of me soscale systems and more detailed information in the boundary layer are particularly important . Advancing S2S predictions will also hinge on the ability to perform data assimilation in cl oudy and precipitating regi ons (see section on data assimilation). Such capability will in turn re ly on a host of routin e, global high-resolution observations of radiation, clouds, and preci pitation. On a slightly longer time horizon, developing such observations and the ability to as similate them will also be important for fully implementing cloud-permitting forecast models (see section on models). Similarly, as models progress to better represent aero sol-cloud interactions \u2014especially for regi ons where radiative forcing from aerosols (e.g., polluted cities) is substantial\u2014it will become essential to expand routine in situ (e.g., Aerosol Robotic Networ k [AeroNet] and Micro- Pulse Lidar Network [MPLNet]) and satellite observati ons of aerosols and to have th e capability to exploit these observations via data assimilation. The United States is a leading contributor to the operational gl obal satellite data coverage used in weather and climate prediction. U.S. federal agenci es have been planning for replacements to aging polar orbiter and geostationa ry satellites, some of which are near or past their expected lifetime. Howeve r, the replacement programs have been beset with delays and cost overruns, leading to the pot ential for a gap in c overage. In particular, a gap in microwave sounder coverage from polar orbiting satellite s could lead to signifi cant degradations in atmospheric monitoring and prediction at weathe r and S2S timescales, a scenario the U.S. Government Accountability Office iden tified as high risk in a 2015 report.17 Two new satellite missions could lead to im portant improvements in global observations of three-dimensional winds and precipitation\u2014t wo of the major gaps in the atmospheric observing network discussed above.

However, issues remain regarding the assignment of vertical location for these obser vations. On the very cusp of development are small, capable sensors that can be deployed on less expensive small satellites (e.g., \"cubesats\"), which in turn can be implemented into multi-satellite constellations providing rapid revisits and a low-cost approach for some operational observation needs (Ruf et al., 2013). Finding 5.1: The current atmospheric observing sy stem is relatively robust, but components of the network are in danger of deteriorating and/or are underutilized and spa tial coverage is still poor in remote areas such as over the oceans and in polar regions. Finding 5.2: As S2S prediction systems evolve in complexity and re solution, routine broad- coverage and higher-resolution atmospheric obse rvations of thermodynamic profiles, clouds, precipitation, and aerosols will become esse ntial to better characterize convection and troposphere-stratosphere interactions, as we ll as to enable cloud- permitting models. Finding 5.3: Space-based satellite observations are likely to be the mo st efficient way to develop the new atmospheric observations that w ill be required for S2S predictions, although other cost-effective approaches to obtain the requisite accuracy and co verage are worthy of continued investigation. Ocean Observations The ocean is significantly under-observed compar ed with the atmosphere, despite being a major source of S2S predictability (Cummi ngs, 2011; Robinson, 2006). Sea-surface temperature (SST) may be the most important oceanic variab le for driving the atmo sphere in the coupled system. This is due to the strong dependence of air-sea heat flux, evaporation, and even the stability of the atmospheric boundary layer on SSTs . Accurate initial condi tions for SST as well as for ocean currents are not sufficient for predicting the time evolution of SST on S2S timescales because the effective ocean heat capa city on S2S timescales depends strongly on how deeply surface thermal anomalies are mixed by near-surface winds, ocean surface waves, and convective instabilities in the ocean mixed-layer. Thus measurements of winds, waves, air-sea fluxes, and near-surface ocean heat content anoma lies and density structure (the latter determines the depths to which near-surface thermal anomalies can be easily mixed) may be just as critical for ocean prediction as SST measurements. Meas urements of salinity are also important for SST evolution, as both salinity a nd temperature determin e the ocean's density structure. There are many places where a layer of relatively fresh water in the top few meters is observed to stabilize an ocean water column that would be uns table if only thermal properties were considered. Transport of properties by ocean currents and a ssociated eddies as well as vertical mixing driven by sheared ocean ve locities also play an im portant role in the e volution of the coupled system at S2S and longer timescales. For exam ple, re-stratification by finite-amplitude, submesoscale, mixed-layer eddies plays a strong role in the evolution of the coupled system (Fox-Kemper et al. 2011), as does the atmospheric response to oceanic variability in areas of high SST variability (Kirtman et al. 2012). When averaged over time scales of the inertial period and longer, extratropical ocean velocities ar e well approximated by a geostrophic and Ekman Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Tropical currents tend not to be as well constr ained by geostrophy, and tidal flows and rectified tidal effects can be important, especially in co astal areas. Thus direct measurements of ocean velocity (e.g., from moorings w ith current meters or drifters ) or estimates of the surface geostrophic and Ekman components estimated via remote sensing (Lagerloef et al., 1999) and tides are particularly valuable for constraining the state of the ocean in tropical and coastal areas at S2S timescales. Velocity measurements that are available in real- time can be directly assimilated into S2S forecast systems, while de layed velocity data (e.g., data that is only available after instrument recovery) plays an im portant role in evalua ting the realism of S2S forecast systems. Additional ocean -related observations that may benefit Earth system forecasts at S2S timescales include biogeochemical quantitie s such as nutrient dist ributions, oxygen levels, and initial plankton distributions. Used as tracer s, these quantities may improve the initialization of the physical aspects of the system, but as th e ocean model grows in sophistication to include biogeochemical processes, such quantities will be needed for initializatio n of these components. Many of the ocean surface processes descri bed above can be well sampled by remote sensing. Satellite measurements of SST, sea su rface height (SSH), and scatterometer-derived surface wind stress are routinely used by ocean prediction systems. However the value of remotely sensed measurements for S2S fo recasting depends critically on having enough instruments to provide continuous measurements with adequate temporal and spatial coverage. For example, the quality and reliability of fo recasts of the ocean mesoscale eddy field depend upon the availability of multiple altimeters for coverage and re silience to instrument failures (Jacobs et al., 2014; Le Traon et al., 2003). Beyond the above physical variables, remotely sensed ocean color (visible wavelength) can be used to constrain biogeochemical ocean model components, which in their simplest use are need ed to determine the vertical profile of solar heating in the near surfac e layer of the ocean (e.g., Murtugudde et al., 2002). The TOPEX/Poseidon and NASA/CNES/NOAA/EUMETSAT Jason missions 19 have provided continuous SSH measurements since 1 992. The Jason-3 mission, to be launched in January 2016, and the Copernicus European Program,20 which will deliver Earth data from a dedicated constellation of sate llites known as \"Sentinels,\" will also provide operational SSH measurements into the coming decade. Additio nal upcoming satellite missions for oceanography and hydrology include the \"Surface Water and Ocean Topography\" (SWOT) mission\u2014a collaboration between the United States and France.21 With an estimated launch date of 2020, SWOT will continue the TOPEX/Jason record of global ocean altimetry but will also complement it by providing unprecedented global high-resolution elevations for small-scale ocean eddy features and for lakes and rivers ove r land. SWOT will likely allow for an important improvement in model representations of the o cean's geostrophic eddy fields and provide an altogether new resource for estimating surface-wate r elevations, both of significant value to S2S forecast considerations and applications. However, since SWOT is a research satellite, its three- year projected mission lifetime is shorter than is desirable for operational use as a part of a well- validated S2S forecasting system. While ther e is a foundation for remotely sensed SSH measurements via Jason and the European Sentinel program, there is grea t concern regarding the continuity of surface wind observations over the ocean.

Presently, the only U.S. scatterometry asset is RapidScat , a two-year mission on the Inte rnational Space Station (ISS). While this implementation comes with some adva ntages (namely the orbit allows resolving the mean diurnal variability of ocean surface winds a nd can provide cross calibration of other agency scatterometers such as the European Organisa tion for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites [EUMETSAT] Advanced Scatterometer [A SCAT]), its inclined or bit does not provide global observations. An additional experimental resource for winds will come from NASA's upcoming Cyclone Global Navigation Satellit e System (CYGNSS) mission, composed of a constellation of eight small sate llites that use GPS reflections off the surface to estimate wind speed (direction not measured). While the coverage from this experimental mission will be limited to the tropics, it will provide an additiona l consideration for future observations of ocean surface wind speed that are likely to be co mplementary to the br oad swath sampling of scatterometers that provide vector wind observa tions. Despite their potential for improving ocean wind measurements, RapidScat and CYGNSS are experimental missions with very limited lifespans. To advance S2S prediction, it is vital to determine a longer-term, sustainable plan for providing global, continuous satellite m easurements of ocean surface winds. Satellites also estimate ocean surface salinity (i.e., from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, SMOS 22, and, until recently, Aquarius missions23). The assimilation of such data has already improved some aspects of coupled for ecasts (e.g., Hackert et al ., 2011; Hackert et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2014), but salinity is a cha llenging measurement to make from space, and further advances are needed. Salinity anomalie s of order 0.1 psu are dynamically important on S2S timescales (e.g., Guan et al., 2014), but this is near the threshold accur acy of current satellite retrieval capabilities on spa tial scales relevant to S2S (cf. Tang et al., 2014).24 However, with a combination of a robust in situ network (e.g., Argo, buoys, see be low) and satellite measurements, a highly complementary set of meas urements can be provided. In situ data can provide accurate absolute salinity values with the benefit of vertical profile information, and satellites can provide global coverage of (only th e) surface salinity with the benefit of spatial gradient information and for measurements in ma rginal seas (although at a distance at least one satellite footprint away fr om the coast; ~50-100km) wher e drifters/buoys are limited. Remote sensing has the potential to deliver routine observations of the ocean surface with coverage (space and time) that cannot be matche d by current in situ observations. However, as illustrated with salinity above, in situ data will continue to be essential for calibrating remotely sensed ocean observations, and some in situ observations are critical for providing routine measurements of variables that are not well- observed via satellite platforms. Furthermore, because radiation penetrates only a short dist ance (millimeters to 10s of meters, depending on wavelength) into the ocean, observing the three-dimensional ocean fields mentioned above (e.g., sub-surface temperature, salinity, and ocean velocities) usually calls for in situ data. 22http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/ The_Living_Planet_Programme/Earth_Explorers/SMOS/ ESA_s_water_mission_SMOS, accessed January 27, 2016. 23 The Argentine Space Agency/CONAE's satellite, hosting NAS A's Aquarius instrument, failed in June 2015, terminating the 4-year record of salinity observations. http://aquarius .nasa.gov/, accessed January 27, 2016. 24 Recent comparisons of satellite to in situ values show RMS errors on the order of 0.28 to 0.51 psu for SMOS (Reul et al., 2014) and 0.2 to 0.3 psu for Aquarius (Tang et al., 2014), each for monthly timescales and grid averages of ~100km.

However, tropical surface moorings are subject to instrument failu res due to long-term exposure to a difficult environment, and they are also commonly dama ged by fishing activities and vandalism. Regular and sustained maintenance of th ese moorings is necessary, but limited access to ship-time for missions to refresh moorings has resulted in data losses and thus time series breaks. For example, lack of maintenance during the period fr om June 2012 through September 2014 severely degraded the TAO array, causing the returned data volume to drop to roughly half its historical rate from the 2000s (Tollefson, 2014). Though the tr opical mooring array can be expensive and logistically challenging to maintain, allowing it to decay through neglec t is unacceptable for what has proven to be a vital element in deli vering skillful and societally valuable ENSO forecasts (NRC, 2010c). A global array of surface drifte rs (e.g., Niiler, 2001) provides synergistic information for satellite measurements of SST, salinity, and absolu te sea surface height (SSH), but its spatial coverage is coarser than Argo (roughly one float on a 5\u00b0x5\u00b0 gr id). For example, the Global Drifter Program (GDP25) provides satellite-tracked surface drifting observations of currents, SST, atmospheric pressure, winds, and salinity over the world's oceans. Other routine in situ measurements are collected and reported back in real-time by voluntee r observing ships and research vessels and moorings. Sensors on mari ne mammals also provide important subsurface ocean data, and such sensors are currently one of the only ways to observe the subsurface ocean in polar regions and beneath sea ice (Roquet et al., 2013, Charrassin et al., 2008). Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs , e.g., gliders or self-propelled vehi cles) can also be used to collect routine ocean measuremen ts (see Box 5.1). The range and usage of gliders is increasing, but the range of propelled AUVs is often still too limite d. They are however, relatively cost effective and can be outfitted with many sensors and sent into areas not commonly covered by other techniques, making further developm ent of this technology attractive. Coastal areas represent a significant challenge for satellite observ ations. Specifically, satellite-based observati ons of winds and SSH are not yet acc urate in coastal regions, where the winds can change rapidly over smaller spatial and temporal scales relative to coarse microwave footprint sizes (~25km). In addition, the side-lob e contamination from the land renders the near- costal observations unusable. Although the SWOT mission will improve the situation for SSH due to its higher resolution (~2km), coastal winds and surface current observations will need to rely on the high-frequency shore- based radar (such as Coastal ocean dynamics applications radar [CODAR] and WavE RAdar [WERA]). These radar observations are increas ing in availability and are a backbone component of NOAA's Integr ated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), but many more of these data sets are needed globall y in order to increase predictability near the coasts. Finally, while there is a global tide ne twork, it is important to keep maintaining it together with measurements from submarine cable instruments to ensure accurate tidal prediction. Wave predictions and th e associated air-sea interactions also require that the wave buoy network is sustained to ensure availability of wave data. In summary, while progress continues to be ma de in advancing in situ and remote sensing measurements of the ocean, includ ing expanding temporal and spat ial coverage and capabilities, the ocean continues to be under-observed relative to its importance in the coupled Earth system. Coverage and continuity of existing SST, SSH , and surface wind observations are important to maintain in order to produce S2S forecasts that are skillful.

In addition to ships and other classic in situ infrastructures (National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine, 2015a), there is a need for inexpensive but effi cient ocean sensing capabilities. Sin ce the \"weather of the sea\" (e.g., Robinson, 1983 ) has timescales relevant for S2S pred ictions, such capabilities will likely be most useful. Fortunately for S2S, in the past 10 to 20 years, the increasing deployment of autonomous ocean observing systems has started a revolution as imagined by Stommel (1989). Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) such as gliders and propelled vehicles (including surface crafts) are employed today for scientific exploration, ocean mapping, commercia l applications, naval reconnaissance, and security. This is possible due to advances in manufacturing (Y uh, 2000), reliability (Bahr et al., 2009; Fiorelli et al., 2006), robotics (Bellingham and Rajan, 2007), a nd autonomy (Curtin and Bellingham, 2009; Curtin et al., 1993; Lermusiaux et al., 2015). Equipped with physical sensors and even biogeo chemical analyzers, AUVs collect observations useful for ocean estimation and forecasting. Their u se in adaptive sampling and exploratory missions is now feasible (e.g., Fiorelli et al., 2006; Haley et al ., 2009; Leonard et al., 2010; Ramp et al., 2009; Schofield et al., 2010). Such missions can involve onboard routing (Davis et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009b) as well as coordination, cooperation, and inter- vehicle information exchanges (Bahr et al., 2009; Leonard et al., 2007; Paley et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2007). Ocean sensing vehicles are now used in groups of heterogeneous type with varied operating speeds. They provide sparse but multivariate data, and their motions can be strongly affected by ocean currents (Lermusiaux et al., 2015). Optimal path planning towards key sampling locations is thus criti cal to save time and energy (Lolla et al., 2014a; Lolla et al., 2014b; Subramani et al., 2015). Since the vehicles provide observations that are ultimately assimilated into ocean models, their optimal control is thus often linked to uncer tainty prediction and data assimilation (e.g., Lermusiaux, 2007; Schofield et al., 2010). Even though the use and deployment of varied types of AUVs for S2S forecasting is not yet common, within the next 10 years they are likely to become useful for such predictions. Long-duration deployments of gliders and other AUVs with suffici ent endurance or drifting capabilities is now an area of active research. Several major research project s (Northern Arabian Sea Circulation\u2014autonomous research [NASCar], etc.) are underway. In addition, si milar efforts are being completed in the air domain with autonomous sensing drones and other UAVs. C oordinating efforts among autonomous oceanic and atmospheric sensing research will improve the collec tion of observations for coupled S2S forecasting of the Earth system. technology and coverage could have tremendous value for characterizing important S2S ocean processes, for model improvement, and for providi ng information for forecast initial conditions. Effective integration of the increasing ocean observations and platforms with S2S ocean modeling systems is also necessary, includi ng data-model comparisons for improving ocean model formulations and advanced data -assimilation for better S2S forecasts. Finding 5.4: Continued investment into routin e space-based observations of sea-surface height, SST, surface key inpu ts to estimates of air-sea fluxes of water, heat, and momentum\u2014are critical to support S2 S prediction systems. Developing satellite- based estimates of ocean surface salinity, currents, mixed-layer, and biogeochemical properties may further advance S2S forecasts.

Expanded use of new and improved drifters, buoys, and autonomous instruments could facilitate cost-effective expansion of the observing network below the surface. Observations of the Cryosphere and Polar Regions More than anywhere else on Earth, the polar regions depend on unique observing methods to confront the challenges of taking m easurements in extreme and harsh environments. Much of the important phenomena for S2S polar pr ediction contain small spatial scales, such as the high degree of spatial variab ility associated with melt ponds, openings in sea ice, patchiness of snow cover, and eddies in the ocean. The hi gh reflectivity of ice and snow surfaces on land and ocean, lack of strong horizontal and vertical temperature gradients, and the extended polar night make atmospheric observati ons difficult from passive radiance s, e.g., visible measurements based on sunlight reflected from clouds or snow, or infrared measurements based on thermal contrasts. Further, sea ice is a barrier to most ocean-observing sate llites. As a result, routine in situ observations are critical to complement sate llite observations around th e poles, in particular for ocean observations. Traditional field-based measurements are also hindered by the presence of sea ice (e.g., Figure 5.4) and a shortage of pop ulation centers from which to operate or launch instruments. Sea ice concentration is one of the most e ssential variables for predicting weather and climate in the polar regions. Fortunately, sea ice concentration can be measured by passive microwave retrievals (the same satellites that observe terrestrial snow cover) through clouds and during both day and night. Passive microwave retrievals also can be used to distinguish first-year (ice that first grew on open water less than a ye ar ago) and multiyear ice. These observations are available since 1979 and provide th e only continuous coverage of sea ice longer than a decade. However, there is high uncertainty in sea ice concentration measurements when melt water is present at the surface and resolutions are relatively coarse (~10 km). Sea ice thickness is less well observed than s ea ice concentration, but it is at least as important for sea ice prediction (Blanchard-Wri gglesworth et al., 2011a; Day et al., 2014). Sea ice thickness is a key constraint on the timescale of variability (~ months to years) for sea ice concentration anomalies. For example, summer sea ice coverage\u2014a variable that is often a target for prediction\u2014is strongly influe nced by sea ice thickness in spri ng (Chapter 4). Scattered field- based measurements of sea ice thickness are available since the late 1950s (e.g., Lindsay and Schweiger, 2015), and in the last two decades a se ries of satellites and aircraft have provided good spatial coverage but not contin uously; in some cases instrume nts were turned off to extend the life of the mission (ICESat 26) and in others melt water on the surface obscured the measurements in late spring and summer (IceBridge27, CryoSat-228). At present, the only thickness-observing satellite is CryoSat-2, operated by the European Space Agency, which has been in orbit since 2010. Because remote sensing actually measures the fr eeboard (height of sea ice and snow above sea level), the accuracy of es timates of sea ice thickn ess depends critically on the availability and qu ality of measurements of snow depth on top of the sea ice. The lack of simultaneous measurements of snow depths and fr eeboard leads to significant uncertainty in the 26 http://icesat.gsfc.na sa.gov/, accessed January 27, 2016. 27 http://www.nasa. gov/mission_pages/icebri dge/index.html, accessed January 27, 2016. 28http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_th e_Earth/The_Living_Planet_Programme/Earth_ Explorers/CryoSat-2, accessed January 27, 2016.

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 5: S2S Forecast Systems: Capabilities, Gaps, and Potential 103 PREPUBLICATION COPY estimate of thickness, but even more problematic for S2S forecasting is the impossibility of retrieving data from the radar altimeter instrument on CryoSat-2 (and CryoSat) in the presence of surface meltwater, or roughly May-September in the Arctic. Nonetheless, CryoSat thickness measurements have been used for sea ice data as similation to initialize forecasts in spring of the ensuing summer season (see section on data assimilation). NASA's IceBridge aircraft mission offers one of the best opportunities to measure simultaneous freeboard and snow depth, though the measurements are limited to about a dozen flight tracks each year over a few weeks in spring since 2007. Even in these opportune conditions, the uncertainty in IceBridge sea ice th ickness is estimated to still be 40 cm (Kurtz et al., 2013). Less accurate snow depths have been estimated for the purpose of computing sea ice thickness from satellite based measurements of fr eeboard in a variety of ways, including from climatological measurements (Kwok et al., 2004), accumulation of snowfall from reanalysis (Kwok and Cunningham, 2008), and using an em pirical method based on ice type and climatological measurements (Laxon et al., 2013). However, the accuracy of resulting sea ice thickness was not reported in these studies. Recentl y, snow depths have also been estimated from the SMOS satellite mission to be nearly as accura te as the IceBridge measurements (Maa\u00df et al., 2013), which is very encouraging. NASA plans to launch a satellite known as the second generation Ice Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat2) in 2017 that can measure sea ice thickness year round, but accurate and simultaneous snow depth measurement are still necessary to fully utilize these observations. Further, the data need to be pro cessed within a day or so of the observation to be useful as input for prediction of the sea ice edge at shorter lead times in S2S forecasts. Finding 5.6: Reliable and accurate year-round sea ice thickness me asurements are the greatest need for sea ice prediction, and con tinued satellite missions will enable this key objective. However, accurate and simultaneous in situ measuremen ts of snow depths on sea ice are needed to translate sign als observable from sa tellite into dependabl e and timely sea ice thickness estimates. Land Surface Observations As discussed in Chapter 4, land surface charact eristics are important for Earth system prediction on S2S timescales, and may be particul arly important for predicting extreme events, such as heat waves and droughts, as well as for characterizing the water cycle. This may be especially true during boreal spring and summer, when coupled Earth system models often exhibit lower predictive skill due to weaker li nks between mid-latitude climate systems and the oceans and an increase in land-atmosphere interactions (NRC, 2010b; Roundy et al., 2014). Soil moisture, snow depth, vegetation, water table depth, and land h eat content all influence the fluxes of heat and moisture between the land su rface and atmosphere, sometimes with important feedbacks to large-scale weathe r and climate and events such as heat waves (e.g., Guo et al., 2011; Roundy et al., 2014; Roundy and Wood, 2015). As also mentioned in Chapter 4, a number of recent studies have found that more realistic initialization of preci pitation and land surface variables, such as soil moisture, snow cover, and vegetation in coupled Earth system models and multi model forecast systems improves the predic tability of atmosphere and hydrologic et al., 2011; Koster and Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 104 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY Walker, 2015; Kumar et al., 2014; et al., 2015; Roundy and Wood, 2015; Thomas et al., 2015). The regions and time periods for which such land-atmosphere coupling is important for weather and climate pr ediction are also likely to expand with global warming (Dirmeyer et al., 2013; Dirmeyer et al., 2014). The ability to measure land su rface and hydrological variable s, particularly on a global scale, is currently limited, hindering realistic mo del initialization and repr esentation of important land processes and land-atmosphere coupling. For ex ample, critical data input into land data assimilation systems comes from in situ measurem ents of precipitation (from rain gauges) and snow and snow depth (from weather stations a nd snow courses), but pr ediction skill has been shown to be limited in the many areas where such measurements are spar se (Koster et al., 2010). Networks such as CoCoRaHS29, the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail, and Snow Network, have improved the density of rain gauge data in the United States for research and monitoring purposes, and such networks might be levera ged for improving real-time modeling. However, there are still vast areas in le ss populated parts of the country a nd especially abroad where there is little to no gauge data. While in situ networks need to be maintained and in some cases expanded in the near- term to enhance S2S forecasting (see below), measurements from satellites may hold the most promise for improving the global characterizatio n of many land surface variables. A few recent and planned satellite missions have the potential to rapidly accelerate progress towards the goal of improved surface soil moisture estimates. The European Space Agency launched SMOS in 2009 to monitor surface soil moisture (~ < 10 cm) using an L-Band microwave radiometer (Kerr et al., 2010; Mecklenburg et al ., 2012). In January of 2015, NASA launched the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite 30, which is designed to monitor the freeze-thaw state as well as surface soil moisture using an L-Band microwave radiometer and radar (Entekhabi et al., 2010). Despite these recent and planned developments, a number of critical gaps remain. The current failure of SMAP's radar has (at best) delayed th e full potential of SMAP data until a stand-in radar onboard another satellite can be used in ta ndem with SMAP's radiom eter. Observations (or better estimates) of soil moisture into the root zone will be key to exploiting the longer-term predictability associated with soil moisture a nd are also for constraining hydrologic predictions. Root zone soil moisture provides the atmo sphere a source of moisture through plant transpiration, with this deeper layer typically ex hibiting longer timescales of variability than soil moisture near the surface. Remote sensing observa tions of root zone soil moisture are typically based on longer (i.e., P-band) microwave waveleng ths. Recently, airborne radar implementations have shown skill in estimating root zone soil moisture, with an indication that satellite implementations may be possible (Konings et al., 2014; Tabatabaeenejad et al., 2015). Observations of snow cover, multi-spectral albedo, and depth are also particularly important for improving S2S forecasts of the at mosphere and the hydrological cycle. Highly accurate global-scale observations of snow c over are currently now available from satellite platforms (e.g., the Moderate Resolution Imagi ng Spectroradiometer [MODIS]). Snow water equivalent (SWE) can also be estimated from sp ace-based passive microwave radiometers, such as the special sensor microwave imager (SSM/ I) and advanced microwave scanning radiometer (AMSR-E). However, these estimates contain si gnificant caveats and uncertainties (Byun and Choi, 2014; NRC, 2010b), and the ability to retrieve snow depth and/or SWE remains a significant challenge. Continued improvement to SWE remote sensing tec hnologies and retrieval 29http://www.cocorahs.org/. 30 http://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/, accessed January 27, 2016. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 5: S2S Forecast Systems: Capabilities, Gaps, and Potential 105 PREPUBLICATION COPY algorithms are needed. However, given the impor tance of snow measurements, more networks like SNOTEL (Snowpack Telemetry), which provides real-time in situ measurements of snow depth from the 600-plus stations across the wester n United States, are likely needed, particularly in areas where accumulated snow pack is a la rge portion of the annual water cycle (e.g., for California\u2014see case study in Chapter 3). In addition to improved precipitation, so il moisture, and snow measurements for initializing S2S prediction systems, a number of other land surface measurements are important for advancing S2S model calibration, model develo pment, and for initializing next-generation operational systems. For example, the NASA SW OT mission mentioned a bove will provide new constraints on surface hydrology vi a surface water elevations and stream flow estimates. Such data will be useful for hydrology model develo pment and land surface model calibration; similar data may be important in the longer term fo r initializing hydrology and river components of future S2S forecast systems. Similarly, littora l observations are useful for monitoring and modeling the effects of coupled ocean-atmosphe re processes in coasta l areas. For example, characterizations and fine-scale observations of land elevation, roughness, cover, soil content, vegetation, man-made structures, and anthropog enic heating would be useful for improving models of wetting-drying, as well as for risk models for storm surges from hurricanes and typhoons making land-fall and heat wave predicti on. These littoral processe s are directly linked to a general need to increase and automate ocean observing systems for S2S predictions, as discussed above. Satellite measurements that can generate better estimates of evapotranspiration are sorely needed to better constrain the te rrestrial water budget and its infl uence on surface fluxes of heat and moisture to the atmosphere. The NASA ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECO STRESS) mission is an experimental multi-spectral infrared spectrometer that will provide high-resolution obse rvations of surface temperature which will be used to explore their value for estimating ev apotranspiration and plant water stress and consumptive use. The implementation of ECOS TRESS on the International Space Station (ISS) provides for characterizing the mean diurnal cy cle (which the current 16-day LandSat repeat does not offer) but it does not provide global coverage. Further, the ISS arrangement only provides for a two-year hosting pr ovision, and considerations of c ontinuity need to be undertaken in conjunction with the determined n eed and value of such measurements. The global network of flux towers are also an important source of data in this regard, as flux towers provide critical m easurements of land-atmosphere fluxes of heat, moisture, and carbon dioxide (Figure 5.5). Such flux measurements are particular ly useful for developing and validating the components of dynamic models that account for processes associated with surface energy balance. In order to maximize improvement in the characterizatio n of land surfaces fluxes within S2S predictions systems, these types of observations are needed with larger spatial coverage, higher density, and in a timely enough fa shion to be useful in real-time operational data assimilation. Finding 5.7: Land observations are critical for modeling large-scale land surface-atmosphere feedbacks and for making predictions of the te rrestrial water cycle. Networks of in situ measurements of precipitation, snow depth, and root-zone soil moisture are likely to remain important, but the poor spatial coverage of such networks currently limits S2S prediction.

These types of sensitivity studies can help determine sources of predictability while also emphasizing the importance of initialization by certain variables and quantities in order to realize predictability. An alternative approach to perturbing the initial conditions ex plicitly is to perform data denial studies (Observing System Experiments, OSEs) usi ng S2S prediction models. This has become common, regular practice for operational NWP and th eir partners in order to accurately assess the utility of various observing platforms in reduc ing forecast errors in real systems with real errors. Similar efforts are also done with in academic and operational ocean forecasting. Observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) (e.g., Arnold and Dey, 1986; Dickey, 2003; Masutani et al., 2007; Ma sutani et al., 2010) provide an other means of exploring the potential impact of future obs erving systems on S2S predictions. In an OSSE, a reference run, typically at the highest resolution possible, is ge nerated from a free run of an ESM without data assimilation. This so-called \"nature run\" is cons idered to be the true state. Sampled values, considered as \"observations,\" from this nature ru n are then used to initialize a forecast system. The simulated observations from the nature run are thus analogous to the tr aditional observations used in an actual forecast and can be used by an ESM with data assimilation to assess the impact of various observations on the analysis and fore cast accuracy. Since the true state is known, analysis error can be computed explicitly. Using this me thodology, a perturbation experiment is then run in which hypothetical obser vations are evaluated in the c ontext of data assimilation and hypothetical forecasts. Such OSSE experiments have been used in the design and decision phases for the Aeolus Doppler wind Lidar instrument fo r NWP (Baker et al., 201 4; Stoffelen et al., 2006). OSSEs have also been proposed as a to ol designing optimal ai r quality observations (Timmermans et al., 2015). OSSEs are powerful tools since they a llow for the exploration of hypothetical observations. However, they need to be designed a nd executed carefully to en sure that the results are meaningful and applicable to the real Earth system. \"Perfect model\" OSSEs (such as the experiments described above) measure the imp act of hypothetical observations on a forecast system in which model and forecast errors are as sumed to be non-existent. To address the more realistic scenario in which models are assumed to have errors, two or more (significantly) different models are required to evaluate the im pact of observations within prediction systems. The first model provides the re ference/nature run and generate s the \"true states\" from which simulated observations are extracte d. The other models are then used to assimilate the simulated observations and generate forecasts that are then compared with the states generated in the first model. If the same or largely similar models are utilized, model er ror goes unaccounted for, resulting in a system that is too predictable. In order to assess and prioriti ze new observations specific to the S2S problem, either type of OSSE would need to be desi gned and carried out using Earth sy stem forecast models, with the generation of the nature run performed with a hi gh fidelity, state-of-the-art Earth system model. This can be computationally expensive, especia lly when it comes to the storage and distribution of the nature run data. Coordinati on among the parties interested in such a nature run is critical. Once available, further coordination on the simula tion of the observations that already exist in the current observing system will be required, paying special attention to the generation and calibration of realistic observation errors. On ce these pieces are avai lable, any hypothetical observation network could be explor ed for assessing its potential im portance. This is one of the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Finding 5.8: Cost-benefit analyses will be necessa ry to prioritize what new observations (of current variables at higher spatial or temporal resolution and/or of new variables) will most benefit S2S prediction systems. OSSEs, and sens itivity studies more generally, are powerful tools for exploring the benefits of specific obs ervations on state estimation and overall model performance, and could be better used to pr ioritize improvements to observing networks as well as S2S model parameterizations. The Way Forward for Observations Observations form the foundation of S2S prediction systems, allowing the characterization of physical pro cesses, model initialization, and the calibration and verification of model outputs. Relatively r obust observing networks exist for the atmosphere over land (outside the polar regions), but current observations networks for the ocean, cryosphere, and land surface will require more attenti on in order to advance S2S forecasts over the next decade. The ocean in particular does not have the necessary coverage despite its very clear importance for S2S prediction. Furthermore, even for the atmosphe re, some critical networks are in danger of deteriorating or of suffering breaks in contin uity within the next decade. These observing systems must be maintained or replaced to prevent an erosion of S2S forecasting skill. Beyond maintaining the current observing network, de velopment of new observing technologies and expansion of existing observing networks will present opportunities to drive improvements in models and model initializations, especially as more components are added to ESMs and forecast system capability expands, growing the need for routine observations of ne w variables within the Earth system (e.g., aerosols, biogeochemistry). As described above, special effort is needed to improve observations in many parts of the world where unique physical proce sses take place but few routine measurements are available. These include polar regions, where sea ice, la nd surface, and atmospheric processes can feed back to high and mid-latitude weather and ocean conditions; tropical areas characterized by convection centers that strongly influence global circulation (e.g., Africa, South America, Indian and western Pacific warm pool ); and highly dynamic coastal areas. Developing observational networks specific to capturing the fluxes of matter and energy within the Earth system also need attention, as the improper treatment of these quantiti es in models can result in substantial biases in water and energy budgets that compromise S2S forecast skill. Both remotely sensed and in situ measurements will be important to maintain and expand. Satellite-based measurements are an incr easingly important component of air, ice, land, and water observing systems and are critical for initializing Earth system models. For atmospheric variables, it will be particular ly important to maintain remotely sensed measurements of the vertical profiles of key at mospheric variables (e.g., temperature, moisture, wind) and to continue to devel op measurements likely to become more important to S2S in the next decade (e.g., precipitation, cloud liquid/ice, aerosol concentration and composition). For the ocean, remotely sensed observations of SST, SSH , and ocean surface winds are vital globally, and preferably at resolutions fi ne enough to resolve mesoscale curr ents and eddies. Coverage in some cases is currently provided by short-term re search missions, but these must be converted to Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Advances in satellite observations of salinity, mixed-layer depth, and near-surface ocean currents also have potential to benefi t S2S forecasting and should be pursued. In coastal areas, targeted and sustained in situ measurements using moorings, ships, AUVs (including gliders), and other autonomou s sensing platforms (see Box 5.1) should be better coordinated and more rapidly utilized for varied S2S research and applications. The S2S needs include critical data assimilation for land- ocean coastal predictions and also the evaluation of satellite products. Further advances in ocean observing technology and coverage could have tremendous value for characterizing important S2 S processes, for model improvement, and for providing information for forecast initial conditions. Effective inte gration of the increasing ocean observations and platforms with S2S ocean modeli ng systems is also necessary, including data- model comparisons for improving ocean model form ulations and advanced data-assimilation for better S2S forecasts. For the cryosphere, continued investment in to generating year-round, remotely sensed sea ice thickness measurements, including snow depth on top of the sea ice, are critical, though in situ measurements may continue to be needed in order to translate th ese measurements into dependable and timely routine estimates. For the land surface, new and/or planned missions for surface soil moisture, surface water, and evapotra nspiration may add considerable value to S2S forecasting, especially for model development, but again many of these are research missions with limited lifespans. Quantities for which there would be a great benefi t to develop new or better satellite measurements in clude snow water equivalent and root zone soil moisture. For many remotely sensed variables, con tinued work to develop better retrieval algorithms will be necessary to realize the full potential of the observations. Looking further ahead, the development of more capable and co st-effective satellite observing systems should continue to be investigated, including constellations that provide multi-sensor observations, small satellite deployments (for example, CubeSat 31) that reduce costs and increase sampling rates and coverage, and new, expanded, and/or more economical sensor designs that provide routine measurements for operational forecasts. Investment in in situ and high-resolution observations, especially from remote or uninha bitable regions and othe r regions with poor coverage remains important, in many cases even with current and planned advances in the remotely sensed observation network. These include measurements from radiosondes, precipitation gauges (particularly in mountainous areas where TRMM is compromised), snow courses, flux towers, and subsurface ocean meas urements of salinity, temperature, and ocean velocity at depth from drifters. More broadl y distributed coastal radar networks for surface current measurement are also a key need. Measurements from moored tropical arrays , which are critical for S2S forecasts of ENSO, also need to be maintained. The design of the tropical moored arrays predates modern S2S forecast systems or the Argo drifter network. If the agencies that have been sustaining the tropical mooring network now find it to be fiscal ly unsustainable, its optimal and sustainable design should be revisited using OSSEs with mode rn S2S forecasts systems to assess their value for ENSO and other S2S forecasts and an analysis that deliberately takes into account the relative maintenance costs, historical inst rument attrition rates, and or issu es (e.g., internat ional political considerations and cost-sharing) of the various mooring locations. Ho wever, it is the view of the Committee that until such a deliberate analysis an d redesign has been carried out, every effort 31 http://www.cubesat.org/, accessed January 27, 2016.

The Committee recognizes that setting up and maintaining in situ networks poses unique challenges, especially in remote locales not suitable for staffed observations and difficult climates. Looking ahead, developing automated and semi-automated instruments that can operate to a year or longer with minimum or no maintena nce would allow for larg e increases in spatial coverage. Technology for automated instruments (e.g., automated radiosonde launchers and ocean gliders and floats) exists but needs to mature (see Box 5.1). On the ocean side, power consumption typically limits the range or li fetime of floats and gliders, and the ongoing development of smaller and more energy efficien t sensors would be beneficial for a diverse range of autonomous observing platforms. Cost-b enefit analyses are necessary to justify the financial and logistical burden. Recommendation E: Maintain con tinuity of critical observati ons, and expand the temporal and spatial coverage of in situ and remotely sensed observations for Earth system variables that are beneficial for operational S2S pred iction and for discovering and modeling new sources of S2S predictability. Specifically: Maintain continuous satellite measurement r ecords of vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature and humidity without gaps in the data collection and with increasing vertical resolution and accuracy. Optimize and advance observations of clouds , precipitation, wind profiles, and mesoscale storm and boundary layer structure and evol ution. In particular, higher-resolution observations of these quantities are ne eded for developing and advancing cloud- permitting components of future S2S forecast systems. Maintain and advance satellite and other obs ervational capabilities (e.g., radars, drifters, and gliders) to provide continuity and bette r spatial coverage, reso lution, and quality of key surface ocean observations (SSH, SST, and winds), particularly near the coasts, where predictions of oceanic conditions are of the greatest societal importance in their own right. Maintain and expand the network of in s itu instruments providi ng routine real-time measurements of sub-surface ocean properties, such as temperature, salinity, and currents, with increasing resolutions and accuracy. Appropriate platforms for these instruments will include arrays of moored buoys (especially in the tropics), AUVs, marine mammals, and profiling floats. Develop accurate and timely year-round sea i ce thickness measurements; if from remote sensing of sea ice freeboard, simultaneous snow depth measurements are needed to translate the observation of free board into sea ice thickness. Expand in situ measurements of precipitation, snow depth, soil moisture, and land- surface fluxes, and improve and/or better expl oit remotely sensed soil moisture, snow water equivalent, and evapot ranspiration measurements. Continue to invest in observa tions (both in situ and remote ly sensed) that are important for informing fluxes between the component interfaces, including but not limited to land surface observations of temperature, mois ture, and snow depth; marine surface Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Apply autonomous and other new observing technologies to expand the spatial and temporal coverage of observation networks , and support the continued development of these observational methodologies. Although it would be beneficial to expand th e geographic coverage and resolution of many types of observations, cost and logistics de mand that priorities be determined. Beyond the general need for more routine obs ervations of the ocean, land, a nd cryosphere to support coupled S2S prediction systems, it is not always clear a priori what measurements will be most beneficial. Determining where to add measurements of existing variables or which new variables to add can be planned more effectively through the use of OSSEs, OSEs, and other types of sensitivity studies that specifically utilize S2S forecast systems in their design and execution. For the case of satellite observations, a recent NRC study also provides a value and decision framework that allows priori tization of new versus continuous measurements (National Academies of Sciences Engi neering and Medicine, 2015b). Recommendation F: Determine priorities fo r observational systems and networks by developing and implementing OSSEs, OSEs, and ot her sensitivity studies using S2S forecast systems. DATA ASSIMILATION Data assimilation (DA) is the process of quantitatively estimating dynamically evolving fields by combining information from observations with the predictive e quations of models. A key purpose of DA is to create initial conditions , which are used to pr oduce operational forecasts as well as retrospective forecasts and reanalysis (see Figure 5.1). DA is also used to control error growth within the model due to limits in predictive capability. Most assimilation schemes are derived from estimation theory (Gelb, 1974; Jazwinski, 1970), information theory (Cover and Thomas, 2012; Sobczyk, 2001), control theory (L eDimet and Talagrand, 1986; Lions, 1971), and optimization and inverse problem theory (Tarantola, 2005). In operational weather and ocean forecas ting centers today, approximations are commonly made to assimilate observations into the model state and parameter spaces. Some common assumptions include: assuming normal, Gaussian error distributions for the observations and for the model st ate (which are often not norma lly distributed); using small ensemble sizes to characterize the uncertain ties in a high dimensional space (i.e., rank deficiency); assuming uncorrelated observati on errors; and using lin earized operators for transforming the model state to observation space or using a linearized version of the S2S model itself. These assumptions can have significant im pacts on the quality of the analysis (Daley, 1991; Evensen, 2009; Kalnay, 2003), and research is needed to develop data assimilation techniques that help overcome these challenges. While traditionally grounded in linear theo ry and the Gaussian approximation (Kalman, 1960), recent research progress has focused on th e development of more efficient assimilation methods that account for nonlinear dynamics and to utilize non-Gaussian probabilistic features. Even though several of these schemes would be challenging to employ in large, realistic S2S Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 112 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY systems, some of the recent progress is promis ing for probabilistic S2S predictions and for the reduction of inherent uncertainties. Enhancing the coupling between components of ESMs is an important challenge in S2S prediction, and recent research on coupled DA is also promising. Accounting for the accurate and possibly non-Gaussi an transfer of observed information from one component of the Earth system to the other is very important for enha ncing the capabilities of strongly coupled S2S forecasting systems. In this section, the Committee provides details on the status of data assimilation efforts in major components of S2S Earth system models a nd then highlights opport unities for advancing S2S forecast systems through coupled data assi milation, hybrid assimilation methods, Bayesian data assimilation, reduced order stochastic mode ling, and the estimation of parameter values and parameterizations. Recommendations for priority rese arch in these topics conclude the section. State Estimation in Earth System Model Components State estimation of Earth system components has generally been performed using data assimilation techniques from one of two cl asses of estimation approaches: (1) maximum likelihood estimates or (2) minimum error varian ce estimates. In geophysical applications, the former can be associated with the so-called variational methods (Cour tier and Talagrand, 1987) and the to Kalman Filters/Smoothers (Kalman, 1960) and ensemble-based schemes (Evensen, 2009). As pointed out in the 2010 NRC report on improving ISI climat e prediction, improving the assimilation of atmospheric observations has yielded significant gain s in numerical weather prediction skill (Figure 5.6). Fo r operational atmospheric NWP applications, incremental variational assimilation has become the method of choice, including 3DVAR (Kleist et al., 2009; Lorenc et al., 2000) and 4DVAR (Courtier et al., 1994; Rabier et al., 2000). More recently, hybrid assimilation algorithms that combine ensemb le and variational methods have led to some further success (Bonavita et al., 2015; Clayton et al., 2013; Kuhl et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013b). Some operational centers are pursuing hybr id four-dimensional ensemble-variational (4DEnVar) techniques either as a first implementation of a 4D scheme (NCEP, Kleist and Ide, 2015), as a replacement (Environment Canada, Bu ehner et al. 2013), or potential replacement (United Kingdom Met Office [UKMO], Lorenc et al., 2015) for 4DVAR. The hybrid algorithms have poten tial computational because tangent linear and adjoint (transpose of the tangen t linear to propagate sensitivities backward in time) versions of the prediction model are not ne eded as direct components of the assimilation solver itself. Such scalability has implications for coupled data assimilation (see below) given that strong coupling can be achie ved without the need for the ad joint of the coupled models (Bishop and Martin, 2012). Ocean data assimilation has led to subs tantial improvements in ocean forecasting capabilities and scientific understanding of ocean processes (Bennett, 1996). Ocean data assimilation is frequently employed for reanalyses that optimally combine model simulations with observa tions and so allow for quantitative scientific studies of ocean phenomena from the small to the global ocean scales. Operational ocean forecasting has also been enhanced by data assim ilation from estuaries and regional seas to the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Often, land surface state estimates are genera ted offline using Land Data Assimilation Systems (LDAS) incorporate near real-time information about me teorological forcing such as wind, temperature, and precipitation from both models and observations (NRC, 2010b). The global land data assimilation system (GLDAS; Rodell et al., 2004), deve loped jointly by NASA and NOAA, makes use of both ground- and space-ba sed observational information to constrain modeled land states in addition to the meteorological forcing from a separate atmospheric data assimilation system. The GLDAS is a mixture of traditional data assimilation for parameters such as surface temperature and snow cover, wi th constraining offline land model-integration that produces estimates of other variables such as soil moisture, snow depth, soil temperature, surface water storage, etc. Thus for some land surface variables, LDAS systems are not necessarily data assimilation systems in the same sense as described for atmospheric and oceanic components, but instead constrain integr ations of offline land surface models. There is progress within LDAS algorithms and within the Land Information System (LIS; Kumar et al., 2006) to use more traditional assi milative techniques such as a simplified Extended Kalman Filter for other variables such as soil moisture (de Rosnay et al., 2013). This will become more viable as new instruments for meas uring soil moisture from the SMOS and SMAP satellite missions come online a nd are directly assim ilated into LDAS (e.g., LIS While difficulties with monitori ng SWE remain, assimilation of th e related variables of snow cover fraction from MODIS (Zha ng et al., 2014) and terrestrial water storage from GRACE (Su et al., 2010) in an ensemble Kalman filter scheme has improved the simulation of SWE indirectly. However, progress has been slow as th e application of traditional (atmospheric) data assimilation techniques for the land surface is complicated by the sp atial variability and heterogeneities of surface parameters and because of the aforementioned issues with observations (Balsamo et al., 2014). In summary, although not as advanced as da ta assimilation in operational atmospheric models, DA systems in other Earth system co mponents are beginning to embrace ensemble- based or hybrid assimilation algor ithms as a way forward. Results so far indicate that this is a promising direction because it allows for a comb ination of the advantages of the different approaches. Xu et al. (2014) show one such example for a land surface application, where a hybrid assimilation scheme is used to improve the assimilation of snow fraction information. Extending schemes such as this to generate coupled ensembles could help forecast the uncertainties and then be used to perform the data assimilation accordingly, either within a weakly or strongly coupled update step (see be low). The use of an ensemble from coupled models would also significantly simplify the design and implementation of coupled background error covariances, which are needed for coupled assimilation. In other words, the data in one field can update the state in another field directly based on these coupled error covariance estimates. As a final note, it is important to keep in mind that while advanced data techniques are generally able to extract information from obser vations, the process of data assimilation is fundamentally dependent on the observing system . A system that is under-observed will not yield accurate state estimates, further highlighting the need to maintain and enhance the observing system (Recommendation E) and to ut ilize quantitative methods (e.g., OSSEs) to do so.

Other Earth system components are also moving towards ensemble Kalman filter- based or hybrid data assimilation algorithms, allowing for the possibility of seamless assimi lation and/or synergy within a framework of coupled data assimilation. Finding 5.10: Research activities in data assimi lation schemes are occurring uniformly across fields, including for land, ocean, and ice appl ications, but also for engineering, applied mathematics, and other sciences. The potential of all of these multi-disciplinary advances cannot be underestimated, and several of these new schemes have potential for S2S applications. Coupled Data Assimilation Historically, many centers performed the as similation of each of the Earth system components\u2014atmosphere, ocean, land, sea ice\u2014 independently. But because the systems coevolve, such disconnected assimilations can co mpromise forecast skill. While this may not pose a problem for very long forecasts (annual to d ecadal), it can be a significant issue for S2S timescales, where initial conditions are still qui te important. Advances include implementing a so-called \"weakly coupled\" assimilation, in whic h the background state (Figure 5.7) is computed from a freely evolving coupled model and then s ubsequently broken into parts that are needed for each component. Next, assimilation is done component-by-component (i.e., ocean, atmosphere, sea ice, and land analyses are quasi -independent). The various analyses are then stitched back together to initialize the coupled m odel and run the forecast. This is in contrast to the aforementioned uncoupled analyses, in wh ich all steps in Figure 5.7 are integrated component-wise. NCEP's Climate Forecast System (v2) has already developed a weakly coupled system for both reanalysis (necessary for re trospective forecasts and calibration) and the generation of initial conditions for the real-tim e operational seasonal forecasts (Saha et al., 2010). Most other operational centers are moving in a similar direction, and many centers are adopting such a philosophy even for weat her prediction (Hendrik Tolman, personal communication, April 22, 2015). Weakly coupled assimilation also allows each possible Earth system component to determine its most appropriate assimilati on scheme. The ECMWF OOPS (Object Oriented Programming System 32) project and the United States JEDI (Joint Effort for Data Assimilation Integration; Tom Aulign\u00e9, Pers onal Communication, February 5, 2016) project are examples of methods to potentially achieve such coupling in a convenient, efficient manner. Specific assimilation schemes for each component can al so be employed in a strongly coupled framework, assuming connections across components are maintained within the assimilation step (this is discussed in more detail below). A challenge for coupled assimilation is th at the spatial and te mporal scales of phenomena, errors, etc., are quite different among the various Earth system components. A direct practical effect of this is di fferent assimilation update cycl es employed in today's single- component assimilation systems (e.g., the time st ep in Figure 5.7). This is in large part a consequence of when and how often observations are available. For example, because of 32http://www.data-assimilation.net/Events/Year 3/OOPS.pdf, accessed February 5, 2016.

To address this issue, ensemble sizes would need to be incr eased or efficient reduced-order uncertainty prediction schemes employed (see below). Atten tion is especially needed for variational approaches, since adjoint equations derived for th e coupled systems are not always the same as each component's adjoints stitched together, particularly when across-component fluxes (e.g., air-sea fluxes) are nonlinear. Sim ilar issues apply to hybrid data assimilation schemes, as complex multiple dynamics (even within a single co mponent of the Earth system) also need to be represented accurately in the c oupled updates. Observations colle cted by the diverse observing system, which contain multiple dynamics and tempor al and spatial scales, may also need special treatment. This might include the filtering of dynamics or scale filt ering so as to remove the risk of spurious coupling before assimilation into S2 S prediction systems. For example, in the ocean, short tidal scales are challenging to handle in gl obal models, and internal tides and waves should not be assimilated as eddies. In conclusion, to be successful, strongly c oupled data assimilation for S2S systems requires research reduced-o rder stochastic schemes for efficient forecasting of coupled statistics. Finding 5.11 While so-called weakly coupled a ssimilation has been successful for generating initial conditions for S2S prediction systems, th ere is potential for so-called strongly coupled assimilation to substantially imp rove state estimates for coupled systems. More research is needed to determine the benefits of strongly coupled systems. Bayesian Data Assimilation, Reduced-order Uncertainty Quantification and Probabilistic Forecasting As mentioned above, many data assimilation algorithms used in operational systems today are linear, based on linearizations, or ba sed on varied heuristic hypotheses and ad hoc approximations. Most of these assumptions are re lated to the probability densities of the model state and its errors, and of th e observations and their errors. For highly nonlinear dynamics or non-Gaussian relations, these assumptions may pr ove difficult to overcome. S2S dynamics are prime examples of multiscale, nonlinear dynamics, from turbulence to large-scale dynamics, across the multiple physical processes occurring in the Earth system. As a result, the field variables that describe the S2S dynamics (e.g., temperature, winds, currents, ice cover, etc.) can have complex intermittent behavior, with multiple scales and unstationary heterogeneous statistics. Furthermore, S2S prediction requires accurate forecasts of both the likelihood of specific events and of overall expected conditions over longer S2S lead times. Efficient reduced- order stochastic methods and Bayesian techniques can help address these issues of non-Gaussian relations, the former for the accurate forecast of probability densities (uncertainty quantification) and the latter for the rigorous combination of observations with these fo recasts (Bayesian DA). The importance of accounting for nonlineari ties in geophysical DA has been known for some time (e.g., Miller et al., 1994 ). Nonlinearities affect the dyna mical evolution, and as a result geophysical fields can be characterized by comp lex, far-from-Gaussian statistics (Dee and Da Silva, 2003; Lermusiaux et al., 2006; NRC, 1993) . With the introduction of the ensemble Kalman filter (Evensen, 1994; Houtekamer and Mitchell, 1998), error subspace (Lermusiaux and Robinson, 1999), square root filte et al., 2003; Whitaker and Hamill, Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 5: S2S Forecast Systems: Capabilities, Gaps, and Potential 119 PREPUBLICATION COPY 2002), and Monte Carlo methods (Doucet et al., 2001) have grown rapidly within the atmospheric and oceanic DA commun ity. In addition to utilizing th e inherent nonlinearities of the governing equations, stochastic methods allow exploration and exploitation of probabilistic structures. Nonlinearities in general lead to non-Gau ssian structures, which need to be used in the assimilation updates (Bocquet et al ., 2010). This allows the use of mutual information in the coupled DA. Nonlinear Non-Gaussian Data Assimilation One class of non-Gaussian DA methods is part icle filters (e.g., Ades and van Leeuwen, 2015; Pham, 2001; van Leeuwen, 2009), which evolve probability density functions (pdfs) using a discrete set of models states or particles. A related intere st has been the approximation of distributions by Gaussian Mixture Models (e.g., Alspach and Sorenson, 1972; advantage of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) is that they become equivalent to Gaussian schemes when a single component is found sufficient to descri be the forecast pdfs but can represent more complex multi-modal pdfs by increasing and optim izing the number of components in the mixture. Such Bayesian DA met hods could be further developed for the S2S system components and for strongly coupled DA. A critical need, then , is the efficient and accurate prediction of coupled pdfs, which is in the re alm of uncertainty quantification. Uncertainty Quantification and Probabilistic Forecasting Probabilistic forecasting and the quantification of uncertainties are critical when systems are nonlinear and have uncertain terms in their governing equations or in their in itial and boundary conditions (see also section below on Calibration, Verification, and Combination of S2S Forecasts). Ensemble predictions provide un certainty estimates, but so far using only a relatively small number of forecasts. To a ddress the resulting rank-deficiency, various localization approximations (Bengtsson et al., 2003; Lermusiaux, 2007) and useful heuristic arguments (Anderson and Anderson, 1999) have b een used. However, just as the adjoint equations allow variational DA based on linearized partial differential equations (PDEs), there are now uncertainty propagation schemes that allow Bayesian DA using pdfs predicted based on nonlinear PDEs. Stochastic model forecasts are feasible w ith numerical methods for stochastic PDEs (Kloeden and Platen, 1999; Xiu, 2010) includi ng direct methods (Doucet et al., 2001) and polynomial chaos expansion and spectral methods (Ghanem and Spanos, 1991; Le Ma\u00eetre and Knio, 2010; Najm, 2009). These approaches can be categorized as either intrusive or non- intrusive, depending if they requi re modification within the nume rical model itself or not. The non-intrusive Monte Carlo method (i.e., running an ensemble of simulations with or without random forcing) can provide the full statisti cs of the problem. However, such ensemble simulations have convergence rates usually propor tional to the square ro ot of the number of samples. The polynomial chaos expansion (Ghanem and Spanos, Li and Ghanem, 1998; Nouy, 2007; and 2002) based on the theory by Wiener (e.g. Wiener, 1958) can Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

(For useful ocean applications, see Mattern et al. [ 2012] and Thacker et al. [2015; 2012]). To account for the time-dependence of both the uncertainty and dynamics, generalized Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve expansion with time varying coe fficients and basis functions have also been used (Lermusiaux, 2001; and Lermusiaux, 2009, 2012; 2013) have been obtained. These reduced PDEs allow efficien t probabilistic forecasts. Sondergaard and Lermusiaux (2013b, a) developed a Bayesian nonlin ear filtering scheme that combines these reduced PDEs with Gaussian Mixture Models, showing advantages of respecting nonlinear ocean dynamics and preserving non-Gaussian statistics. In summary, Bayesian DA and uncertain ty quantification methods have shown significant promise to advance coupled DA and UQ, but continued research is needed to yield significant impacts within the context of realistic S2S coupled ocean, atmosphere, land, and ice applications. If new numerical modeling systems were to be developed or augmented, it would be essential to consider stoc hastic forcing, uncertainty quantification, observation models, and coupled DA schemes as part of their developmen t for physical and numerical consistency. This is due to the advent of the a bove uncertainty forecasting and Bayesian inference methods that directly utilize the original coupled governing equations and their numerical schemes. Such integrated developments would thus be directly relevant to S2S applications, as they imply the integration and coupling of the S2S modeling co mponents (atmosphere, land, sea, and ice) from the start. Finding 5.12: Research on Bayesian data assimilation and uncertainty quantification has grown substantially in atmospheric and oceanic sc iences and also across disciplines such as applied mathematics and engineering. These meth ods, which allow the optimal use of the full probabilistic information and utilize rigorous reduced-order differential equations, hold promise for integrating com ponents of S2S prediction systems and for coupled data assimilation. This includes research in hy brid methods, multiscale rigorous stochastic Importance of Reanalysis for Retrospective Forecasts, Validation, and Parameterization Retrospective data assimilation with frozen variables, so-called \"reanalysis,\" plays a crucial role in providing initial conditions for re trospective forecasts and as validation datasets from which to perform verification and ca libration (see also Combination, Calibration, Verification, and Optimization s ection below). Reanalyses also provide insights into model process shortcomings (see Models section below) . Indeed for over 40 years, reanalysis datasets have led to improved understanding of the Earth system, prediction at longer lead times, and the diagnosis of extreme events and long-term tre nds. Having physically consistent datasets across Earth system components is vital for diagnosin g, initializing, and validating S2S prediction systems, which are dependent on representing coupling in order to realize forecast skill. Despite their importance, global reanalyses are a huge undertaking, requiring a ma ssive amount of staff time, computation time, and data. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 5: S2S Forecast Systems: Capabilities, Gaps, and Potential 121 PREPUBLICATION COPY There are a variety of global reanalysis e fforts that have been carried out at many different prediction centers (e.g. www.reanal yses.org [accessed January 27, 2016]). These reanalyses have different motivations and goals (Dee et al., 2011; Ebita et al., 2011; Rienecker et al., 2011; Saha et al., 2010; Uppala et al., 2005). However, the advancement of modeling capabilities, coupled data assi milation techniques, and harvesting of additional historical observations continue to have poten tial to vastly improve reanalys is datasets, especially coupled reanalysis for S2S prediction. As an example, NCEP is planning for their next generation coupled reanalysis capability as part of the de velopment of version 3 of their Climate Forecast System. The plan includes significant developm ents to aspects of the reanalysis system, including observations, modeli ng, assimilation (including coupled DA), and the addition of new components such as aerosols and waves. There ar e similar efforts elsewher e in the international community (Dee et al., 2014). While some of th ese efforts involve performing reanalyses through the satellite era, there ar e other efforts underway to recr eate datasets for much longer time periods, such as the NOAA 20th century reanalysis (Com po et al., 2011), ERA CLIM (Stickler et al., 2014), and CLIM-2,33 which will utilize the coupled data assimilation for climate reanalysis (Laloyaux et al., 2016). While these reanalyses will provide physically consistent state estimates for the Earth system components that are pa rt of the S2S systems, there is a disconnect between the retrospective initialization from these reanalysis datasets and the initialization of real-time forecasts. The real-time initializa tions generally evolve away from the frozen reanalysis systems due to the addition of new observa tions and/or improvements in th e data assimilation itself. In other words, the real-time initialization evol ves with advancements to avoid significant deterioration that could occur if the assimilati on were to be kept frozen (i.e., instruments eventually disappear and are replac ed with new observing platforms). Finding 5.13: Reanalyses are critical for gene rating retrospective forecasts, for studying predictability, and for validating S2S forecast s. Continued investment in global reanalysis research and operational production will be important for advancing S2S predictive capabilities. Improving the tem poral continuity and the freq uency of reanalysis may be particularly beneficial. Data Assimilation to Improve Cloud Representation One difficult problem in atmospheric data assimilation involves the use of cloudy and precipitation-affected satellite ra diances (Bauer et al ., 2011; Errico et al., 2007). Currently, many centers ignore fields of view that are affected by clouds a nd precipitation (particularly for infrared radiances), only utilize the partially clear scenes, or assi milate so-called \"cloud-cleared\" radiances. Cloudy and precipitating radiances are part icularly important as they help prescribe the state in areas of the globe undergoing dist urbed conditions. Ignor ing these observations leaves gaps in the most dynamic parts of the atmos phere, areas that are like ly to have the largest error growth. Improving the use of observations in cloudy areas is a very active area of research amongst the operational NWP centers, with some progress being made over the past several years (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting [ECMWF], UKMO, NCEP; 33 http://www.ecmwf.int/en/re search/projects/era-clim2, accessed February 5, 2016 Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 122 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY Geer et al., 2014). Further advancing the use of su ch observations may be especially critical in the tropics, for example, in ini tializing the state of the MJO. Along similar lines, only a tiny fraction of available satellite observations of the atmosphere (particularly infrared and radar observations) are actually assimilated into NWP models. While the assimilation of rain rate and precipitable water from TRMM and SSM/I has been Treadon, from space-based precipitation underutili zed. Similar to cloud and precipitation-affected radiances, space-based radar is problematic for present data assimilation schemes due to nonlinearity and difficulty in forward simulation. Gaussian variable transform has the potential to improve the assimilation of precipitation data into NWP models (Lien et al, 2015), and further improvements may be possible through direct assi milation of dual-polariza tion reflectivities from the Global Precipitation Mission co re (e.g., Hou et al., 2014, see also Observations section). In sum, better atmospheric initializations in cloudy and precipitati ng areas is important for predicting the evolution of important S2S phe nomena such as the MJO (e.g., Benedetti et al., 2005; Hou et Tsuyuki, 1997; Vintzileos and Behringer, 2008), along with the potential for benefits in pr edicting soil moisture. Such improvements might also lead to better reanalyses , better cloud climatologies, and thus greater potential for exploration of sources of predictability. Finding 5.14: Observations continue to be und erutilized in atmospheric data assimilation, particularly satellite based microwave and infrared radiances over land and in cloudy/precipitating fields of vi ew. Better utilization is important for filling in some of the data gaps over dynamically active regions, and also fo r characterizing the states and properties of cloud and precipitation-related processes, wh ich will be essential to preparing for cloud- resolving capability. Fully Exploiting Data Sets to Estimate Parameters and Parameterizations In addition to being important for initializing models, data assimilation is a sophisticated means of using observational information for the estimation of uncertain model parameters (Bell et al., 2004; et al., 2013; Trudinger et al., 2008). Two particularly relevant recent studies have explored the use of data assimilation-based parameter estimation for coupled atmosphere-ocean models (Kondrashov et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2015) . Here, using inline parameter estimates significantly reduced model biases, even for variab les such as deep ocean temperature and zonal ocean currents that had no observations assimila ted to the model to constrain them directly. Parameter estimation has also been shown to be feasible for intermediate Earth system models (Annan et al., 2005). However, the challenges men tioned above for state estimation are similar or even more relevant for parameter estimation, due to intrinsic nonlinearity. More research is needed to extend the usefulness of DA for pa rameter estimation (e.g., Bocquet, 2012; Bocquet and Sakov, 2013). Data assimilation has also been used to estimate variables in the Earth system that are not well observed and/or may not have any a-priori information, such as surface carbon fluxes (Kang et al., 2012). Thus a bright research area is the use of data assimilation to rigorously discriminate among model formulations and pa rameterizations, which is critical for both scientific understand ing and applications.

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 5: S2S Forecast Systems: Capabilities, Gaps, and Potential 123 PREPUBLICATION COPY Finding 5.15: In addition to being useful for opt imal state estimation, data assimilation can be an extremely powerful tool for performing parameter estimation and optimizing model performance, which may become critical for S2S applications. It is impor tant that reanalysis datasets and diagnostics therein, such as an alysis increment and innovation statistics, continue to be publically disseminated to assist in parameteriz ation development and parameter estimation. The Way Forward for Data Assimilation Data assimilation is an essential part of S2S prediction systems and is critical for generating real-time initial conditions as well as the initial conditions for the retrospective forecasts (in the form of reanalysis). However, there are a number of issues in current DA that need to be resolved to improve S2S forecast syst ems. First, parts of the varied observing systems remain underutilized by current data assimilati on techniques. Examples include the lack of assimilation of satellite information in cloudy an d precipitation regions a nd the limited use of ocean observations collected by the increasing nu mber of autonomous ocean platforms. More research is needed to comprehensively and effectively assimilate such measurements for S2S applications. Some of the challenges originate from the multiple spatial and temporal scales occurring within and across the components of the Earth system. Ideally, the multiscale and multi-dynamic information contained in the observ ations could be fully assimilated. Multiscale hybrid methods, coupled-covariance update algor ithms, and nonlinear non-Gaussian schemes show promise for addressing these challe nges, but need research to mature. Second, given that S2S predictions will continue to rely on coupled Earth system models, coupled data assimilation will remain at th e forefront of S2S research and operational innovations. However, S2S-specifi c challenges for coupled data assimilation originate from practical, computational, methodological, and dynamical hurdl es, all of which need to be overcome. For example, most operational centers continue to face inconsistencies that result from independent or quasi-independent state es timates being pieced together in uncoupled or weakly-coupled assimilation systems. Overcoming such limitations will become ever more important as S2S prediction systems become mo re complex (i.e., adding new components such as aerosols and surface waves). Instead of being ignored, the complex but known dynamical inter-connections and the corresponding coupled c ovariances or mutual information should be exploited. If the coupling is correc t, it is likely to increase accu racy of S2S forecasts. To allow such immediate impact of observations from one component to another, and across varied dynamics, efficient strongly coupled assimilation schemes are needed. The potential of the first strongly coupled algorithms has already recently been demonstrated for simple coupled models with 4DVAR (Smith et al., 2015a) and EnKF schemes (e.g., Sluka et al., 2015). However, strongly coupled assimilation scheme s are in their infancy and have not yet been tested on more complex S2S coupled systems. Thus practical and computational res earch is needed, in part to assess the potential value added by moving to strongly coupled da ta assimilation schemes, and also to establish whether implementing strong co upling is worth the added cost and complexity to operational S2S systems. Methodological and dynami cal research is also needed, especially to employ and improve assimilation methods that exploit the coupled dynamics to perform multiscale and coupled assimilation updates.

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 124 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY Third, data assimilation, uncertainty quantif ication, and probabilistic prediction methods are critical for S2S forecasting, but are t oday often characteri zed by heuristics and approximations that are employed for computatio nal expedience more than accuracy. Needs in this area include efficient stoc hastic schemes to forecast the coupled statistics and coupled Bayesian data assimilation updates to fully uti lize the coupled statisti cs. Novel uncertainty quantification schemes and reduced-order stocha stic methods that effi ciently integrate the governing stochastic partial differential equations are being developed and may in the future represent possible further avenues for improvement of S2S forecast systems. These could replace computationally expensive direct Monte-Carlo S2S ensemble predictions (i .e., the integration of a number of model simulations with different initial conditions, boundary conditions, and stochastic forcing). Research on Bayesian da ta assimilation has also grown recently in atmospheric and oceanic sciences, as well as acro ss disciplines such as applied mathematics and engineering. These methods, which allow the op timal use of the full probabilistic information and utilize rigorous reduced-ord er differential equations, should also be considered for implementation in the components of S2S prediction systems. Finally, as the complexity of coupled Earth system models grows, an increasing number of model and coupling parameters will need to be explored and specified. At present, this is done too often through trial and error. This could eventually become unsustainable due to the ever- growing complexity and computational cost. Hence, the most sensitive and important model parameters should be identified for the next generation of coupled prediction models. Being informed by observations from all components, data assimilation can identify and optimize these parameters and also discriminate among and le arn the better parameterizations. As a whole, novel parameter estimation and model learning sc hemes are promising and critical for S2S applications. Recommendation G: Invest in research that advances the development of strongly coupled data assimilation and quantifies the impact of such advances on operational S2S forecast systems. Specifically: Continue to test and develop weakly coupled systems as operationally viable systems and as benchmarks for strongly coupled implementations. Further develop and evaluate hybrid assi milation methods, multiscale- and coupled- covariance update linear assimilation, and rigorous reduced- order stochastic modeling. Optimize the use of observations collected for the ocean, land surface, and sea ice components, in part through coupled-covarian ces and mutual information algorithms, and through autonomous adaptive sampling and observation targeting schemes. Further develop the joint estimation of c oupled states and parameters, as well as quantitative methods that discrimina te among, and learn, parameterizations. Develop methods and systems to fully utilize relevant satellite and in situ atmospheric information, especially for cl oudy and precipitati ng conditions. Foster interactions among the growing numb er of science and engineering communities involved in data assimilation, Bayesian in ference, and uncertainty quantification.

In th is section, the Committee provides evidence to support the conclusion th at reducing errors and biases in Earth system models must be a top priority for improving coupled S2S predic tion systems. We first discuss in general terms model errors and the steps that need to be taken to reduce them . For convenience, issues more specific to advancing models of the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, and sea ice are discussed in separate subsections, although of course it need s to be recognized that the full problem is inherently a coupled one. Anothe r subsection highlights the impor tance of process studies for model improvement. The Committee concludes with a subsection that co ntains recommendations for priority research to reduce model errors in order to increase the skill of S2S predictions. Model Errors One of the key challenges for S2S predicti on is the reduction of model errors. Model errors include two types of deviations from observations, both of which contribute to the deterioration of S2S forecast skill: 1. Deviations that are highly variable in tim e, which make the predicted variability unrealistic; 2. Deviations from observations that are persiste nt in time, which make the predicted mean state unrealistic\u2014these are ofte n referred to as model biases. Improving model skill through techniques su ch as statistical correction using retrospective forecasts, and combining outputs of different models to create multimodel ensemble products (see section below on Combination, Calibration, Verification, and Optimization), clearly enhance forecast skill and will remain an important part of the S2S prediction process for the foreseeable future. Howe ver, model errors can be large compared to the predictable signals of variability target ed by S2S forecasts, and can also combine non- linearly, making statistical post- processing very difficult. Furt hermore, without reduction of model errors, all other steps taken to improve S2S predicti on systems can only shorten the distance between the current skill and the model-estim ated limit of predictability (see Chapter 4), whereas reducing model errors can bring the skill of S2S forecast systems s ubstantially closer to fundamental limits of predictabi lity within the Earth system. Known errors in Earth system models ar e numerous. For example, many global models produce an unrealistically strong Pa cific equatorial cold tongue, a spurious double Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), erroneously high Indian Ocean and tropical South Atlantic SSTs, low SSTs in the tropical North Atlantic , and wet or dry biases in rain fall in many parts of the world (e.g., Hirota et al., 2011; Li and Xie, 2014; Richter et al., 2012; Roehrig et al., 2013; Toniazzo and Woolnough, 2014 ). Many climate models also have a la rge bias in MJO variance (Hung et al., 2013). Improving models' abilit y represent processes such as the MJO and ENSO\u2014critical sources of S2S predictability (see Chapter 4)\u2014includes not only improving the representation of means and variances of such phenomena, but also their evolution and associated global teleconnection patterns. For example, it is possible for a model to have little bias in the mean and Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 126 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY variance of both conditions in the tropics and middl e latitudes, yet the va riability in these two regions may not be correctly linked. Such a conn ection contributes to subseasonal forecast skill in both regions (e.g., Lin et al., 2010; Vitart and Jung, 2010). Many of the same modeling errors relevant to S2S predictions are relevant to shorter and longer range forecasts. Figure 5.9 shows an exampl e of the growth of SST errors in coupled model simulations. It is clear that many features of climate model er rors are seen in forecasts of only a few weeks or even days in length (e.g., cold equatorial Pacific, generally warm Indian Ocean, and cold Arabian Sea), and that some of the errors are qu ite substantial on S2S timescales. Efforts targeted at und erstanding and alleviating these errors are thus relevant for improving predictions on multiple timescales (NRC, 2012b). The use of observational and short- term error information has been used to iden tifying biases in climate models, for example through the Department of Energy Cloud-Associ ated Parameterizations Testbed Program.34 Similarly, many issues are common across multiple modeling systems. For example, the strength of MJO-NAO teleconnections is deficient in subseasonal and seasonal simulations of many different operational models (Scaife et al., 2014a; Vitart et al., 2014). Model errors often have no single cause but ar ise from combined deficiencies in model representations of many impor tant processes (e.g., clouds, mi crophysics, radiation, boundary- layer processes, surface fluxes, and ocean mixing). Reducing these errors will require improving the representation of processes that are, for the most part, already included in models used for S2S prediction (e.g., increasing model resolution to explicitly represent critical processes and improving parameterization schemes to better represent subgrid processes\u2014see discussions below for more details). In some cases, extra comp lexity needs to be added to better represent feedbacks between different components of th e Earth system (e.g., coupled ocean-atmosphere, ice-atmosphere and land-atmosphe re processes\u2014discussed in more detail below). As described elsewhere in this report, an improved represen tation of additional variables (e.g., algal blooms, river levels, etc.) may also be crucial because these variables ar e important to decision makers, whether or not their evolution feeds back on other components of the Earth system. Finding 5.16: Errors in current modeling systems are a major limiting fa ctor in the skill of S2S predictions. Many of the issues are comm on across different modeling systems and a broad range of timescales (days to centurie s). These errors are the result of multiple deficiencies in model representations of k ey processes that are currently parameterized. Atmospheric Models Several steps are essential to improve th e atmospheric component of S2S forecast systems. These include increasing model resolution to explicitly represent important atmospheric processes, improving parameterizations of pr ocesses that remain unresolved, improving the representation of tropical convection, and en abling global cloud-permitting models. Each is discussed in detail below. 34 http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/projects/capt, accessed January 27, 2016. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Recent work has shown that more modest increases in atmospheric model resolution may bring signifi cant benefits. Exampl es include increasing horizontal resolutions to better resolve the la nd-sea distribution in the Maritime Continent (Crueger et al., 2013), where the MJO in models exhibits more difficulty propagating eastward than over the open oceans (Inness a nd Slingo, 2006; Weaver et al., 2011) ; increasing vertical resolution in the atmosphere to better represent the st ratosphere (e.g., Roff et al., 2011; Scaife et al, 2011), which is increasingly r ecognized as a source of predicta bility on S2S timescales (see Chapter 4); increasing vertical re solution of the upper ocean to be tter resolve the diurnal cycle of the mixed layer that interacts with the atmos phere, leading to improved MJO simulations (Tseng et al., 2015); and increasing horiz ontal resolution to improve repr esentation of blocking and the Annular Modes (Jung et al., 2012; Ki nter et al., 2013; Palipane et al., 2013; Scaife et al., 2011). Further work to investigate what can be achieve d by increasing resolution in the atmosphere is important, and coordinating such work with rese arch on benefits of simultaneous increases in resolution across other components in a coupled model framework may be particularly important for S2S prediction (NOAA, 2015). However, it is already clear from existing work that increasing resolution in atmospheric models alone is not a panacea for increasing forecast skill in the current generation of models. Improvement of parameterizations will still be needed for substantial enhancement of S2S forecast sk ill (e.g., Jung et al., 2012; Vitart 2014). Finding 5.17: There is evidence that increasing the resolution of atmospheric models (while still at resolutions that need deep co nvection parameterization) may improve the representation of processes that are key sour ces of S2S predictability. However increasing resolution is far from a panacea without also improving physical parameterizations. Improving Parameterizations There are very significant uncerta inties with parameterization s of many physical processes in the atmosphere that are not currently re solved by models (e.g., boundary layer, convection, clouds and microphysics, radiation, surface fluxes , land surface and watershed scale processes, gravity wave drag). These uncertainties are in la rge part responsible for the model errors, which (as previously discussed) are a major limiting factor in the qu ality of S2S predictions. For example, leading NWP centers are taking very di fferent approaches to the parameterization of drag on unresolved mountains (Figure 5.10). Wh ile in practice ther e is considerable compensation such that parameterizations w ith weak mountain drag tend to have higher boundary layer drag (and vice versa), these diffe rent balances cannot all be correct. Such differences matter with regard to the representation of large-scale ci rculation, and this situation is illustrative of the general uncertainties in the field of parameterization. Recent experience at many operational cente rs has indicated that improvement in physical parameterization typically leads to improvements in features more obviously of relevance for S2S (Vitart, 2014). As an example, improved entrainment in the cumulus parameterization of the ECMWF model has led to better representation of the MJO (Hirons et al., 2013). Improving parameterization requires advanced understanding of the physical processes at play, which involves research on theory, targeted fi eld observations, and the use of cloud-resolving or cloud-permitting models as to ols.

SOURCE: Ayrton Zadra. and sea ice models are provided below in the subsection on Process Studies for Model Advancement. Finding 5.18: Improving physical parameterizations is essential to redu cing model errors. The primary barriers are incomplete understanding of real physical processes and the challenges associated with encapsulating new knowledge of how the real atmosphere works in multiple and interacting model parameterizations. Improving the Representation of Tropical Convection There are important challenges associated with almost all aspects of atmospheric model physics, as described above. However, one particul ar issue of great importa nce for the quality of S2S predictions (both in the tropi cs and beyond) is fidelity of the representation of tropical convection in the atmosphere (e.g., Holloway et al., 2014; Sherwood et al., 2014). Tropical convection is crucial to propagating teleconnec tions between the tropics and mid-latitudes\u2014 associated with ENSO on the seasonal timescal e and with the MJO on the subseasonal timescale (Chapter 4). One important approach to improving the re presentation of tropical convection is to continue to develop and improve upon traditional parameterizations. Progress in recent years includes increasing the sensitivity of models to environmental moisture, including convective momentum transport, incorporating at least some representation of convective organization (particularly at the mesoscale), treating convec tion as a stochastic process, and including nonlocal effects in cumulus parameteri zation. Work to improve upon traditional Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 130 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY parameterizations needs to conti nue; however, a more focused effort to develop completely new schemes may be especially valuable (Holloway et al., 2013). The time may be ripe for such efforts, as results from recent field campai gns continue to increase the understanding of convection and its interaction with other processes, and scientists are beginning to have access to high-resolution cloud-permitting simulations across large (e.g., Marsham et al., 2013) and even global domains (Satoh et al., 2012). Such high resolution numerical simulations were, for example, used as part of the recent intern ational Year of Tropical Convection (YOTC\u2014see Appendix C for more detail) program (Moncrieff et al., 2012; Waliser et al., 2012) and provide an invaluable testbed for deve loping understanding and approach es to be used in coarser resolution models, while also spearheading effort s to demonstrate a prototype of future, cloud- resolving S2S model systems (s ee also discussion below). One intermediate step to improve cumulus pa rameterization within the limit of available computing capability is \"super-parameterization\" or multi-scale modeling (Khairoutdinov and Randall, 2001; Randall et al., 2013). In this appro ach, a 2-D cloud-resolving model at each grid point of the host model replaces a traditional para meterization in order to explicitly represent deep convection. This approach demands much less computational resources than a full 3-D global cloud-permitting model, although it still su ffers (as do many traditional parameterizations) from the fact that it is local, e.g., without dir ect interaction between convection at neighboring host model grid cells. Sensitivities to other pa rameterizations (e.g., turbulence and microphysics) also remain. Nevertheless, there is evidence that the super-parameterizat ion approach, by virtue of representing tropical convection more accura tely than conventional parameterizations, produces superior simulations a nd predictions when coupled to an active ocean model (DeMott et al., 2011; Stan et al., 2010). The approach has led to important improvements, notably, in simulations of the MJO (Benedict and Randall, 2009) and diurnal cycl e in rainfall (Pritchard and Somerville, 2009). Its feasibility to incorporate into operational models is worthy of further investigation. Finding 5.19: Improving the representation of tr opical convection is a particularly important challenge for S2S. Continued efforts to devel op new convection parameterizations and to build on recent progress in multi-scale modeling an d scale-aware parameterization are needed. Enabling Global Cloud-Permitting Models In a cloud-permitting model, the grid spacing is fine enough (a few kilometers or less) that deep convection is explicitly calculated without the need of parameterization. Work to move atmospheric models towards cloud-permitting capac ity is motivated by the notion that behavior of deep convection can be adequately determ ined only when mesoscale dynamics governing convective structure and evolution are explicit ly represented. Simulations by the first global cloud-permitting model have led to improved repres entation of important S2S processes such as the MJO (Miura et al., 2007), tropical cyclon es (Fudeyasu et al., 2008), Asian summer monsoon (Oouchi et al., 2009), and the diurnal cycle of rainfall (S ato et al., 2009), among other phenomena. Although such improvements suggest th at the development and use of global cloud- permitting models in operational settings should continue to be pursued, a number of important caveats to this approach need to be noted. The first is that while parameterization of deep convection would no longer be needed, paramete rization of shallow convection, turbulence, Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 5: S2S Forecast Systems: Capabilities, Gaps, and Potential 131 PREPUBLICATION COPY radiation, cloud microphysics, and surface fluxes would all still be required. Without deep convection parameterization, defici encies in schemes for those processes would still lead to model errors (which might be different from thos e in coarser resolution m odels). Hence research to further improve parameterization schemes will remain crucial, even with global cloud-permitting capacity. Also, the huge computational demand that would be required to make global cloud-permitting models operational for S2S is a currently a crucial limitation. For example, upgrading a model from a resoluti on of 60 km to 2 km would requi re the computational power to increase by well over a factor of ~1,000 (i.e., 30x30) for the horizontal resolution alone. A further factor of around 30 would be required to allow for desired decreases in time step and finer vertical resolution. Overall, this means increasing computati on power by at least four orders of magnitude. Realistically, this will not be ach ieved in the next decade, based on the current trajectory of advancement in computing technology (see Chapter 7). Caveats aside, there are many good reasons to pursue global cloud-permitting modeling in research mode. Such research will show the way for operational developments beyond the 10- year horizon and could yield si gnificant insights and improvement s to operational models with parameterized convection within 10 years. For example, predictability studies with cloud- permitting models might give different indicati ons from coarse-resolution models of what improvements in S2S forecast skill could be possibl e. Furthermore, as mentioned above, detailed high-resolution synthetic datasets from these cloud-permitting research models (global, or at least large domain) will continue to provide criti cal insights into real atmospheric processes, as well as a testbed against which new parameteriza tions for operational systems can be developed and evaluated. Lastly, even if it is unlikely th at global cloud-permitting models would become operational in the next decade, it could be of great benefit for the S2S research community to develop cloud-permitting research models if an unexpected revolution in computing industry allowed operational cloud-permitting models to move forward. An alternative hybrid approach worthy of c onsideration is adaptive meshes, which focus high resolutions only in some areas (e.g., Chen et al., 2013 for hurricanes). Its justification comes from the fact that in many areas of the world, cloud-permitting resolution is not needed (e.g., in deserts, subtropical highs, and polar areas where deep convecti on is very unlikely to occur). Utilizing cloud-permitting meshes only when and where deep convection occurs would benefit computational efficiency, and this approach is becoming more feasible as scale-aware cumulus parameterization schemes are also being de veloped (e.g., Arakawa a nd Wu, 2013; Grell and Freitas, 2014). Finding 5.20: Continued development of global cl oud-permitting models is needed to provide insights for improving coarser-resolution operati onal models, to offer research testbeds for understanding many issues relevant to S2S pr ediction, and to advance prototypes for future cloud-permitting S2S model systems. Improved model equations as well as improved numerics with adaptive meshes and higher-order schemes could serve as an important alternative or an intermediate approach before glob al cloud-permitting models become feasible for operations. Ocean Models The ocean is often described as the flywheel of the Earth's climate (Visbeck et al., 2003), where the ocean's large heat cap acity (2.5 m of water contains as much thermal energy as the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 132 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY entire atmospheric column) acts as stabilizer. Outside of the tropi cs, the ocean has traditionally been described as reacting to high-frequency ch anges of the atmospheric forcing and that its influence back to the atmosphere is weak on short timescales (Kushnir et al., 2002). However, one needs to distinguish between applications that are sensi tive to slowly evolving boundary conditions (e.g., NAO, ENSO, etc.) and ones that are sensitive to rapidly evolving boundary conditions (diurnal cycle impact on MJOs, convec tion, severe weather, etc.). Ocean numerical models are often designed to be optimal for a sp ecific application (global, coastal, ENSO, etc.) and do not perform equally everywhere. It is therefore important to fully understand the implications of the numerical and physical choices that were made when the model was developed in order to correctly interpret the model outputs (e.g., Griffies et al., 2000). In this section, ocean models, their application to S2S forecas t systems, and their current strengths and limitations are described. Broadly sp eaking, many of the issues are similar to those outlined above in the atmospheric models s ection, including the importance of improving parameterizations of subgrid processes, while al so exploring the benefits and trade-offs of increasing ocean model resolutions. Established Ocean Models Most existing ocean models are community models and are used extensively for a wide range of global, basin-scale, and regional simulations, with ti mescales ranging from hours to millennia for both operational forecasting (see G ODAE, 2015 for a review) and research (e.g., Hecht and Hasumi, 2013). Most models solve sim ilar geophysical fluid equations and use related finite-difference or structured mesh finite-vol ume numerics. These have all evolved from the pioneering work of Bryan (1969) and others (e.g., Bryan and Cox, 1968; Semtner, 1995) Substantial improvements that are typical of more modern models include the use of higher order and monotonic tracer advection scheme s, the replacement of a rigid lid with a split time stepping scheme that directly models the ad justment of the free surface via external gravity waves, and more accurate representations of bathym etry. Significant effort has also gone into the selection of the vertical coordi nate. This can have a large imp act on the quality of a simulation, with geopotential-height-, terrain-following-, or density-coordinates, or hybrids between these options being common choices (Griffies et al., 2000). Algorithmic simplicity, interactions between the ocean flow and topography, water mass preservation, and th e representation of dense gravity currents are all factor s that have been used in choosi ng the right vertical coordinate for a particular ocean modeling application. Such mature, horizontally-structured-mesh ocean models will be the basis for global operationa l S2S forecasting systems for the foreseeable future, even as they continue to be incrementa lly improved. But it is clear that unstructured-mesh ocean models with higher order numerics have a lo t of potential for S2S forecasts as discussed below. Finding 5.21: Horizontally-structured-mesh ocean models will continue to be the basis for most operational coupled S2S forecastin g systems for the foreseeable future.

Most of the impetus for integr ating high-resolution eddying models in global numerical simulations comes from the need by navies throughout the world for advanced global ocean nowcasting/forecasting systems (in the Unite d States, the resolution will be increased in 2017 to 1/25\u00ba (~3.5 km at mid-latitudes); Chassi gnet et al., 2014; Metz ger et al., 2014). Of course, for many ocean-related a pplications on S2S timescales, su ch as oil spill modeling (e.g., Deep Water Horizon) and fisheries/algal bloom prediction, higher resolution ocean models are necessary. While there is a demonstrated need for fine resolution ocean prediction systems for predicting oceanic variables outside the naval co ntext (GODAE, 2009), the question arises as to whether explicitly resolving ocean eddies matters to coupling with the atmosphere and therefore to S2S atmospheric forecasts. In a recent compar ison of coupled simulations with high and low resolution ocean numerical models, the correla tion between SST anomalies and the surface heat flux was found to be small outside the tropics for the low resoluti on experiments, indicating that the atmospheric forcing of SST variability is pr edominant at that resolution (Kirtman et al., 2012). On the other hand, the hi gh-resolution (1/10\u00ba horizontal resolution, i.e., eddying regime) simulation showed high correlations in regions of enhanced SST variability, such as western boundary currents and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. This s uggests that the atmosphere actually responds to the oceanic va riability in areas of high SST variability and that higher model resolution is needed to improve atmo spheric as well as ocean predictions. There is also evidence that small-scale heat-content anomalies are more strongly and extensively correlated with preci pitation in coupled model simula tions with an eddy-resolving ocean, suggesting a mechanism whereby internally driven ocean variability may influence the deep atmosphere. For example, Bryan et al. (201 0) show that characteristics of frontal scale ocean-atmosphere interaction, such as the posi tive correlation between SST and surface wind stress, are realistically captured only when the ocean model co mponent explicitly resolves the ocean eddies. Griffies et al. ( 2015) further show the importance of transient mesoscale eddies on the ocean heat budget, providing an additional argume nt for either explicitly including eddies in coupled model simulations, or for employing paramete rizations that faithfully reflect the role of eddies in both lateral and vert ical heat transport. Submesos cale SST gradients may also be important loci for coupling to the atmosphere (Back and Bretherton, 2009; Li and Carbone, 2012; Smith, 2013). Oceanic eddies exhibit a wide range of spatia l scales, from large rings that detach from western boundary currents via mixed barotropic and baroclinic instab ilities (Gulf Stream, Kuroshio, Agulhas, North Brazil, Gulf of Mexico Loop Current, etc.); to ba roclinic eddies whose slumping effects need to be accounted for in orde r to correctly model the transports of water masses (e.g., Gent, 2011) and the dynamics and st ructure of major current systems like the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (e.g., Farneti et al., 2010; Hallberg and Gnanadesikan, 2006); to the sub-mesoscale eddies with horizontal scales of order of a kilometer that drive the frontal restratification of the surface mixed layer (e.g., F ox-Kemper et al., 2008). All of these oceanic eddies have effects that need to be represen ted in skillful ocean forecast systems, either by explicitly resolving them or th rough parameterization. The large meanders and rings are readily captured in ocean models with resolutions on th e order of 1/4\u00b0 or finer, while submesoscale Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 134 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY eddies are characterized by spatial scales of less th an a kilometer and need to be parameterized in essentially all large-scale ocean models (Fox- Kemper et al., 2011). Baroclinic eddies pose a particular challenge, as the dominant length-sc ale of these eddies (the first baroclinic deformation radius) varies greatly with latitude, stratification, and ocean depth. As shown in Figure 5.9, global numerical ocean models with spatia l resolutions ranging from 1\u00b0 down to just a few kilometers include both regions where th e dominant baroclinic eddy scales are well resolved and regions where the model's resolution is too coarse for the eddies to form. Due to the relative spatial scales of these eddies and the mean st ate upon which they operate, commonly used baroclinic eddy parameterizations (e.g., Gent et al., 1995) are more effective at suppressing eddy variability than they are at replicating their effects on the mean state (Hallberg, 2013). Consequently, it is usually preferable to allow a model to explicitly simulate oceanic eddies rather than parameterize them, wherever the resolution permits this. Essentially all global ocean forecast models for the next 10 years and beyond will be operating within the resolution range where baroclinic eddies can be e xplicitly represented in most of the domain, but still have to be parameterized on the shelf and at high latitude s (Figure 5.11). Additional research is thus required to determine how best to parameterize th e effects of ocean eddies where they are not resolved and how to transition between areas wh ere eddies are resolved and where they are parameterized (see the CLIVAR Exchanges (20 14) Special issue on \"High Resolution Ocean Climate Modeling\" for a discussion). Other subgrid processes also need to be taken into account for S2S prediction. Several National Scien ce Foundation (NSF)/NOAA-sponsored Climate Process Teams (CPTs) 35\u2014e.g. groups of scientists who have worked together to improve parameterizations of particular processes\u2014have developed parame terizations of internal tides and surface wave-induced mixing, but these need to be evaluated. Finding 5.22: Subgrid ocean processes, includin g eddies, internal tides, and surface wave- induced mixing, need to be more explicitly resolv ed or better parameterized in ocean models used in S2S forecast systems, and their impact on S2S forecasts need to be better evaluated. Multi-Scale Ocean Modeling For improved S2S applications, instead of a uni form increase in reso lution, one approach that may be more affordable computationally would be to increase the ocean horizontal resolution in targeted geographica l areas that have a strong dynamical impact on the system, i.e., tropics, coastal regions, etc. Th is would improve the representation of energetic motions and exchanges that occur in regions with complex geometry and/or dynamics and that have been found significant for larger-scale re gional and global ocean dynamics. Two approaches may allow for optimized refineme nts in areas with larger dynamical gradients, near steep topography, or around complex coastlin es. Nesting uses finer modeling grids in targeted regions, while unstructured grids incr ease the mesh resolution progressively where needed within the same modeling framework. Ne w techniques that use different equations depending on the space and timescales are also ve ry promising. This would allow for the explicit representation of, for example, small rivers, su rface waves, internal waves/tides, nonhydrostatic effects, ecosystem structure, localized hypoxia, or leads in sea ice.

Furthermore, si nce air-sea fluxes depend not only on the conditions in the atmosphere, but also on processes in the upper bo undary layer and mixed layer as well as the sea state (Chen et al., 2007), surface wave effects need to be taken into account for S2S prediction, as do tidal effects on mixing. While this air-wave-ocean coupling has been implemented in some operational models (e.g., ECMWF, COAMPS) it has not been in others (e.g., NCEP). Finding 5.24: Including surface wave effects in S2 S Earth system models could lead to a more accurate representation of the upper boundary layer and sea state. Higher-Order Numerics While the existing horizontally-structured- mesh ocean models described above have excellent computational efficiency per degree of freedom, most are base d on conservative but relatively low-order staggered di scretizations (e.g., Griffies et al., 2010; Griffies et al., 2000). There is a growing body of research on the use of unstructured-grid, adaptive-mesh, or higher- order methods (Beck, 2009; Deleersnijder et al., 2010; Mavriplis, 2011; Sli ngo et al., 2009) that aim to increase models' accuracy without a concomitant increase in computational cost. A specific advantage of unstructured meshes is th eir geometric flexibility, which allows for more accurate solutions, but a significant drawback is a reduced efficiency per degree of freedom. As a result, many unstructured-grid models have focused on shallow water regions with complex geometries (e.g., estuaries) and/or continuous schemes for finite-v olume or finite-elements. In addition, unstructured finite-volume schemes ar e usually limited to second-order numerics in space. For higher-order spatial discretizations with significant advection, finite-elements are possibly more versatile. Discontinuous Galerkin schemes also appear promising and are being developed for open baroclinic ocean modeling (e. g., Blaise et al., 2010; Karna et al., 2013; Karna et al., 2012; Maddison al., 2011a; Maddison et al., 2011b; Ueckermann and Lermusiaux, 2016). Similar efforts are occurring for atmospheri c modeling at varied scales and resolutions, and for different purposes (e.g., Giraldo and Restel li, 2008; Marras al., 2009; Palmer, 2012; Pielke, 2013). For example, the Naval Research Laboratory is developing a Discontinuous Galerkin dynamical core for its Navy Environmental Prediction sysTem Utilizing the NUMA corE (NEPTUNE) atmospheric model (NUMA is the Nonhydrostatic Unified Model of the Atmosphere DG core). It is currently being tested for accuracy, scalability, and computational cost (Gabersek et al., 2012). Other next-generati on atmospheric models are under development, including community earth system models with probabilistic capabilities (e.g., Hurrell et al., 2013; Palmer, 2012). Finding 5.25: Inspired from computational flui d dynamics and related fields, new numerical methods and higher-order schemes are being developed for ocean modeling. The resulting higher-order accuracy and enhanced refinement capabilities can reduce numerical errors in ocean models, which is a promising development for the longer-term prediction needs of S2S applications. In summary, priorities for ocean model im provements for S2S forecasting include both fundamental numerical capabiliti es and improved depictions of important oceanic phenomena. An example of an important new numerical capabili ty would be the ability to focus resolution in Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 5: S2S Forecast Systems: Capabilities, Gaps, and Potential 137 PREPUBLICATION COPY particular regions of phenomenologi cal (e.g., straights that constrain flows) or forecast interest (e.g., harbors) in global ocean models. Many important oceanic phenomena are simply omitted from most S2S forecasting systems, such as ti des and their interactions with storm surges. Oceanic mixing of nutrients is important for bi ological productivity on S2S timescales, but in models it is the result of both numerical artifac ts and deliberate parameterizations, motivating improvements on both sides. The dynamics of th e near surface ocean are of particular importance for the coupled ocean at S2S timescales, so the representation of ocean boundary layer turbulence and its interactions with waves and sea ice are a promising subject of study for improving S2S forecasts. But the most important li mitation on oceanic S2S forecasts arises from the global influence of the ocean at these times cales, along with the need to accurately represent many important oceanic phenomena at relatively small scales to capture this influence. This need to model the global ocean with fine scale de tail places a premium on computational capacity available for S2S forecasts and on utilizing numeri cal techniques that maximize the value of the available resources. Sea Ice Models As discussed in Chapter 4, sea ice is an impor tant source of predictability to the Earth system because sea ice anomalies can persist for up to a few years, during which time the anomalies can influence ocean and atmospheric c onditions. Further, predicting sea ice itself is valuable for its impact on transportation and coastal erosion vulnerability, among other things. Sea ice models need to capture the physical pr ocesses that give rise to the high degree of heterogeneity in sea ice thickness, melt-pond cove rage, and other characteristics that influence shortwave radiation, clouds, atmospheric stabil ity, and ocean freshwater exchange. Many NWP models do not include interactive sea ice compone nts, and the local sea ice concentration and thickness in these models is prescribed and c onstant with only the surface temperature and (sometimes) the snow depths allowed to vary (see for example, specifications of NOAA's GFS 36). To predict the evolution of the ice and snow thickness, and heat transfer within the ice and snow and with other components, the sea i ce component in coupled Earth system models must be interactive and at a minimum include sea ice thermodynamics. Adding explicit modeling of sea ice dynamics\u2014such as the sea ice moti on and deformation that redistributes the ice thickness locally and produces openings, known as leads\u2014can, along with modeling thermodynamics, allow for predictions of sea ice concentration. Sea ice components in climate models a nd Earth system models have evolved significantly over the past two decades due to recognition that sea ice strongly influences radiative and ocean feedbacks and because obser vations have offered improved constraints on sea ice processes and parameteri zations (e.g., Bitz et al., 2012; Notz, 2012). Many sea ice models account for an ice-thickness dist ribution, which treats a distributi on of sea ice thicknesses in an individual model grid cell, to improve the fidel ity of processes that st rongly depend on sea ice thickness, such as sea ice growth and compressive strength. Mode ls are also beginning to treat brine cycling (Hunke et al., 2011) to simulate biogeochemistry within the ice and model the process of melt pond formation and drainage. Ho wever, most of the sea ice components in models used for S2S applications are much simpler, with bare-minimum dynamics and thermodynamics (e.g., Merryfield et al., 2013b; Msadek et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013a). 36 http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/GFS/doc.ph p#seaice, accessed January 27, 2016. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 138 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY The small scale features at the floe scale a nd below suggest that model resolution may be important to improving predictions. The freque ncy of grid cells with very low sea ice concentration and very high net heat flux to the atmosphere has been found to increase at higher resolution (Newsom et al., 2015). New sea ice dyna mical schemes that account for anisotropy of sea ice properties (e.g., preferred orientation of fractures and faults within the horizontal plane) over 10s of kilometers, and much more while treating the sea ice as a continuum, may be a promising alternative to explicit ly resolving fine scales (e.g., Tsamados et al., 2013). However, such methods are not yet well tested, and little research has been done to investigate their potential for S2S applications. Several potentially important processes are as yet missing or untested in nearly all Earth system models including (1) blowin g snow and the redistribution of snow on sea ice, (2) floe size distribution influence on ice gr owth and deformation, (3) waves breaking floes, and (4) ice microstructure (i.e., porosity an d/or defects) influence on comp ressive strength. Inclusion of these processes into S2S systems may offer opport unities to predict new s ea ice properties with societal value. In summary, priorities for sea ice mode l improvements for S2S prediction include parameterizing the sub grid-scale di stribution of sea ice thickness and floe sizes and treating the evolution of albedo, heat, and liquid water of melt ponds. Thes e aspects of sea ice strongly influence the seasonal cycle of sea ice concentration and thickness. Modeli ng the anisotropy of deformation offers the potential of predicting the orientation of leads, which could be an advantage for planning shipping routes. The more advanced models ha ve these capabilities already, but they are not routinel y used nor have they been inve stigated for the purposes of S2S prediction. Finding 5.26: Sea ice models used for S2S often use bare-minimum thermodynamics and dynamics. However, sea ice models have been developed with sophisticated physics that account for phenomena such as the ice-thickness distributio n, melt ponds, biogeochemistry, and divergence/convergence processes. New meth ods are being developed to account for wave- floe interactions, blowing sn ow, and ice microstructure. Finding 5.27: The fidelity of sea ice simulations appears to improve with resolution. New promising sea ice dynamic parameterization schemes may preclude the need for high resolution in some situations, but little resear ch has been done to inve stigate their potential for S2S applications. Land Surface and Biogeochemical Models The land-surface model (LSM) accounts for the land-atmosphere interactive processes, such as the exchange of heat, moisture, and momentum at the surface. As described in the Observations section of this chapter and in Chapte r 4, such fluxes influence the likelihood of heat waves, droughts, storm formation, and monsoons , and may become increasingly important to climate and weather prediction as the global climate warms (e.g., Dirmeyer et al., 2013; Dirmeyer et al., 2014). Despite the ever-gro wing number of dyna mic LSMs, a recent intercomparison has highlighted that the perfor mance of dynamic LSMs is still in some cases inferior to much simpler statistical models for sensible heat flux (Best et al., 2015) Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 5: S2S Forecast Systems: Capabilities, Gaps, and Potential 139 PREPUBLICATION COPY Another important purpose of LSMs is to model surface hydrology, where groundwater and streamflow are included to connect terrest rial water (e.g., soil moisture, surface water, and snowpack) with rivers, lakes, and oceans to co mplete the water cycle. LSMs are often deeply rooted in biogeochemical processes (e.g., car bon and nitrogen cycli ng and other ecosystem processes) due to the fundamental interacti ons of vegetation and so il systems with surface hydrology. Coupling between land -surface hydrology and the ocean can be important for determining near shore currents and salinity a nd for ocean biogeochemical cycles. Indeed, coastal ocean salinity can be st rongly determined by river disc harges, particularly during flood events and seasonal flooding (Milliman and Farnsworth, 2013). The LSMs in NWP systems typically focus on dynamically representing snow cover and soil moisture, while prescribing vegetation c over to vary seasonally based on satellite observations.37 LSMs in Earth system models today usually also predict vegeta tion at some level (Bonan, 2008 and see below), which permits a greater degree of interactio n with the hydrologic cycle and biogeochemical cycling\u2014both of which have significant societal impacts on S2S timescales (Chapter 3). Representation of surface hydrol ogy is still often relatively simplistic in Earth system models used for S2S forecasting, with water runoff not collected and moved through rivers to coastal areas. Many more complex hydrologic mode ling systems exist with river routing and drainage basin models layered atop land surface m odels, but they are typically run \"off-line\" and are driven by climate and weather forecasts from coupled models. These models incorporate the influence of human water management and use on surface and groundwater storage and river streamflow. Systems are being actively de veloped and used for operational hydrologic forecasting (for example within NOAA's NWS and Of fice of Hydrologic Development, see also Yuan et al., 2015). While further re search is needed to understand the extent to which inclusion of such hydrological models within coupled S2 S forecast systems would benefit S2S forecasts across the system (for example, by explicitly informing coastal salinity and currents), such coupling would enable more dire ct, dynamical S2S predictions of stream and river flow as well as coastal flooding and hypoxia. Furthermore, the potential user base for such S2S hydrologic predictions is large (Chapter 3). Enabling and supporting the coupling of hydrologic and river routing models to climate and weather models is a strategic science go al of NOAA's Office of Hydrologic Development (NOAA, 2010). Whether they include hydrologic processes such as river routing or not, LSMs in coupled S2S forecast systems need to continue to be improved through higher fidelity and increased complexity in order to represen t important coupled processes in S2S forecast systems and also to meet increasing user needs for hydrologic, ecologi cal, littoral, and coastal ocean S2S predictions. This includes (but is not limited to) impr oving the parameterization of surface energy partitioning into sensible, latent, soil, and out going longwave radiation through improved plant and soil processes, snow/soil-ice physics, and by including biogeochemical cycles. Land- atmosphere interactions (see Figu re 5.12) also need to be carefu lly evaluated and considered, in particular feedbacks with surface and boundary-l ayer physics, convection, and water and energy budgets (Chapter 4). This needed progress in land and hydrological model development is slowed by lack of reliable obser vations and climatology estimates .

A vol canic eruption is an unanticipat ed event with consequences on regional to global scales whose evolution and outcomes on S2S tim escales are addressed as a key prediction need elsewhere in this report (Chapter 6). Coupling biogeochemical dynamics to other ESM components may also be important for S2S predictions of the atmosphere because biogeochemical dynamics can influence albedo, moisture availability, and temperature profiles on S2S timescales. For example, it is increasingly recognized that initializing and re presenting vegetation can also imp act S2S predictability of the atmosphere (e.g., Koster and Walker, 2015). Wh ether physical and biogeochemical models should be coupled or uncoupled\u2014with the biogeoc hemical model run \"off line\" and on demand due to the vast input data requirements of accurate biogeochemical modeling in a turbulent fluid\u2014depends on the timescale on which land and ocean biota feedback to the physical models. Global climate models began to include a wide array of biogeochemical cycles in the last two decades, and model terminology has evolved to reflect this new capability. Today, a global climate model that includes biogeochemical cycl es is often called an Earth system model. Carbon vegetation modeling usually involves predicting the leaf area and treating leaf processes that influence photosynthesis at a minimum, a nd may also allow vegetation growth and decay, competition, and soil carbon pools. The current ca pability in atmospheric components includes the formation of aerosols, aerosol-cloud inte ractions, and the evolution of atmospheric composition (greenhouse gases, ozone, and othe r pollutants). Biogeoche mical modeling in the ocean involves both uptake and release of gases, chemical reactions, and biology from the single celled (algae and bacteria) to multicellula r phytoplankton, zooplankton, and sometimes even seaweed and fish. ESMs have generally not yet in corporated biogeochemical cycling in sea ice. However, there is active development in a fe w models now to include sea ice algae, gas exchange, chemical cycling, and soot de position on sea ice (e .g., Holland et al., 2012; Vancoppenolle et al., 2013). Finding 5.29: Incorporating biogeochemical cycl es into S2S prediction systems has the potential to improve S2S forecasts because bi ogeochemical cycles often feedback to other components of the physical system, and becaus e they influence societally important concerns such as ocean and large-lake hypoxia, fish st ocks, marine productivity , harmful algae blooms, crop yields, disease epidemic s, and fire occurrence. Coupling Between Model Components As highlighted above, S2S prediction is i nherently a coupled problem. Information transfer between the atmosphere, ocean, ice, wa ve, and land provides fundamental sources of predictability on the S2S timescales. Meanwhile, m odel errors are also passed between different components and this error growth represents a consequential limitation to S2S prediction skill. The importance of air-sea coup ling, land-air coupling, and sea ice coupling has been fully recognized, but representations of such coupling in models still need substantial improvement. Several types of coupling ar e priorities for implementation or improvement in S2S operational systems. Ocean surface waves are needed as a buffer between atmospheric momentum and ocean currents. Precipitation arri ving at a catchment basin and delivered to the coastal ocean via an estuary th rough river routing requires hydr ological and land surface models that are coupled to atmospheric and ocean m odels. Other examples include biogeochemistry Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 142 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY models coupled with ocean, and land and atmo spheric models that include biogeochemical feedback on S2S timescales. Reliable coupler s need to be designed based on advanced knowledge of coupled processes with an aim to matching observed fluxes where measurements are available. These processes are often not resolv ed explicitly in S2S models and need to be parameterized. Because changes in parameterization in one component can lead to increased model errors in another part of the coupled system , coordination and collaboration among different communities of researchers focused on different part s of the Earth system is important in this context. Finding5.30: Because of the coupled natu re of S2S variability and prediction, parameterization for either interactive processe s within individual co mponents of the Earth system or coupled processes between them must be improved in a cohesive manner instead of in isolation. Process Studies for Model Advancement As discussed earlier, reducing model errors is among the highest prio rities for advancing S2S forecast systems. Major sources of mode l errors are parameterization schemes for unresolved, poorly understood, or computationally burdensome processes across all model components (atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, a nd land surface). Developing and refining parameterization schemes can be achieved throu gh three closely connected steps: observing physical processes in the real world, improving understanding of these physical processes, and translating that new knowledge into improved models. Field observations As model resolution continues to increase to wards cloud and eddy perm itting or resolving scales (similarly for resolving sea ice floes and fracture heterogeneity, watersheds, mesoscale and stand scales in hydrology and land ecosystem modeling), more detailed information of physical processes is needed to develop a new br eed of parameterization. It is important to recognize that field observations for process studie s are different from sustained observations for climate and applications monitoring (e.g., Observa tions section of this Chapter), though some data sets may meet both purposes. Observations for improving parameterizations are most often taken from special field experi ments that include ground-based, s eaborne, and airborne in situ, along with space-based remote measurements. In situ measurements are the most reliable sources of information for many physical processes central to model parameterization (e.g., cloud, precipitation, radiation, turbulence, aerosol, soil moisture, vegetation, surface waves, and surface fluxes of land, ocean, and ice) and the only sources of information for subsurface oceanic processes (e.g., mixing and currents). Modern observing technology affords observations of these processes with ever-increasing details and accuracy to meet the need of devel oping parameterization schemes. Moreover, in situ observations provide the most accurate descriptions of coupling or interaction among the multiple processes that must be adequately re presented in models to advance S2S prediction.

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 5: S2S Forecast Systems: Capabilities, Gaps, and Potential 143 PREPUBLICATION COPY Processes-level observations need to take the full advantage of the most advanced technology, including seaborne, airborne, a nd land-based autonomous devices. Space-based data provide global and routine co verage, augmenting the limits of temporal and spatial coverage inherent in field observation s. Products with reliable vertical profiling of the atmosphere, information of ocean and land surfaces, and higher sampling rates by multiple sensors are the best complements to in situ obse rvations for process studies. More specifically, there are key physical processes where experimental satellite obser vations are sorely needed to characterize processes critical to modeling S2S phenomena (e.g., deep convection, soil moisture, ocean mixed-layer depth). Key among these are information on vertical motion within storm systems, increased thermodynamic and wind in formation within the boundary layer, and simultaneous measurements of aerosol, cl ouds, and precipitation to better describe cloud/precipitation growth. In this regard, and wi th the expected increa ses in resolution of models in mind, it is essential that these types of space-based measurements are able to resolve mesoscale features of the atmosphere. Field experiments targeting a single process (e.g., cloud ice, ocean mixing) with single observing platform (e.g., an airplane, a ship) have effectively improved many individual parameterizations and need to continue. S2S pr ediction systems include coupled components of Earth, and their skill can be dr amatically improved only when all model components and their coupling are advanced. Indeed global models have evolved to a stage that errors are unlikely due to deficiencies in representing a single proce ss. Such coupled processes can be adequately observed through field experiments with sufficien t breadth to cover mu ltiple processes across more than one component of the Earth system. Pa st success stories of coupled experiments with lasting and broad impact all involved multip le observing platforms and international participations. Examples are the GARP (Global Atmosphere Research Program) Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE; Houze and Betts, 1981), the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experime nt (TOGA COARE; Webster and Lukas, 1992), Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (S HEBA; Uttal et al., 2002), the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA; Lebel et al ., 2010), and the VAMOS (Variability of the American Monsoon Systems) Ocean-Cloud-At mosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment (VOCALS-REX; Wood et al., 2011) (see Appendix C for more de tails on past and current major coupled field campaigns). Common to these and othe r successful process studi es is that they all address coupling or interaction between various processes within the same components of the Earth system and interactive processes between different components of the Earth system (land, ice, atmosphere, and ocean). Field experiments of that scale are expe nsive and logistically challenging but their data are si ngularly beneficial to model de velopment (e.g., Fairall et al., 2003; Park and Bretherton, 2009). Finding 5.31: Specialized and comprehensive fiel d observations are necessary to inform and improve representations of unresolved processes, including coupled pro cesses in and between various components of S2S prediction models. New observing technology, both remote sensing and in situ, and international co llaboration/coordination could e nhance the ability to meet the demand for more detailed information on in teractive and coupled processes within S2S models.

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 144 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY Transforming understanding of physical processes to model improvement Field observations provide the foundation fo r new knowledge of interactive processes key to S2S prediction. However, the trem endous knowledge gained from many field observations has helped more to diagnose sources of model errors than to actually reduce these errors. One reason for this is the distance between what model developers need and what can be observed. For example, many cumulus parameteri zation schemes depend on vertical mass fluxes in clouds, and as mentioned above, these are very difficult to observe. In this case and in many others, advancing observing technol ogy is critical to shorten the di stance between what is needed and what is currently observable. Meanwhile, fu lly tapping the rich information from existing field observations for model development requires knowledge of observing technology by modelers and knowledge of mode ling by observation experts. T hus transforming new knowledge from observations into model improvement require s collaborative and pers istent efforts by teams that include observationalists, da ta analysts, and modelers. For the longer (climate) timescales, the NSF/NOAA Climate Process Teams have been highly successful in developing improved parameterizations. Further support for this and si milar efforts, including staff and computing time, is critical for transferring knowledge gained through process studies into actual improvements in parameterizations (see also Chapters 6 and 7). Given the nature of field observations\u2014namely limited coverage in space and time\u2014it is na\u00efve to expect a single field experiment woul d lead to a breakthrough in model development and S2S prediction. Each field experiment fills a gap in our in situ observational database, but it is the totality of all field experiments together that provides the need ed information for overall improvement for S2S systems. Because it is impo ssible to have detailed process observations at all desired locations and time, an approach of integrating field observations and high-resolution modeling is essential to bri dge the gap between field data and improvement of model parameterization. As discussed earlier, gl obal and large-domain cloud-permitting and non- hydrostatic ocean models that ar e well calibrated and validated by field observations serve as vital tools for transforming knowledge gained from field observations to model improvement. Large-eddy simulation (LES) models provide add itional details, such as shallow clouds and ocean internal waves. Finding 5.32: Transforming field observations to model improvement requires persistent collaborations among experts w ith knowledge of observations, data analysis, and modeling who can effectively integrate field observat ions and modeling for model improvement. The Way Forward for Advancing S2S Models In current forecast systems, m odel errors are one of the most limiting factors in achieving the skill that might be afforded by S2S Earth system predictability. Many of the issues that lead to model errors are common across different mo deling systems and a broad range of timescales covering days to centuries, i.e., across weather forecasts, S2S forecasts, and long-term climate simulations. These model errors are likely th e result of multiple deficiencies in model representations of key processes that are currently parameterized. Investment in research aimed at understanding and reducing model errors is ab solutely essential in improving S2S predictions.

The motivations for this concept are that weather and climate prediction mode ls are built upon the same physical principles, and cross-scale interactions in the Earth system provide predictive power and predictability limits across these scales and thus need to be adequately represente d in all models (Hoskins , 2013). Indeed, although numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate pred iction sometimes have different requirements (e.g., model resolution and complexity, integration length) , they share many commonalities. They are both based on the same set of equations of motion. They both need parameterization to represent unresolved processes, and many of their biases can be traced to the same deficiencies in parameterization of phenomena such as tropical convection. They both rely on observed states of the Earth system to initialize their integrations and to verify and calibrate their predictions. A seamless framework for weather and climate models has been advocated by many (Hurrell et al., 2009; Palmer et al., 2008; Shapiro et al., 2010; WMO, 2015a). Seamless prediction systems may offer numerous advantages for S2S forecasting and for rela ted decision-making frameworks such as \"ready-set- go\" (Brunet et al., 2010; R obertson et al., 2015; Chapter 3). As discussed elsewhere in this report, an adequate S2S prediction system needs to embrace aspects that are common in conventional NWP\u2014 including high resolutions and adequate representatio n of complex, mesoscale storm systems\u2014and those that are essential to climate prediction\u2014complexity and coupling of Earth system components. For example, important sources of S2S predictability such as the MJO depend on (and feed back onto) climate modes like ENSO and also interact with higher-fre quency weather perturbations. Other cross-timescale interactions may be important fo r developing so-called \"forecasts of opportunity\" (Chapter 4), and exploiting the conditional skill in such forecasts is especially important to S2S prediction. Seamless prediction systems also require common central elements including dynamic cores and parameterization systems, expanded computational infrastructure, de dicated manpower, and coordination between research communities to test developments such as new parameterization schemes on different timescales. These are many of the same issues that are advocated elsewhere in this report as ways to advance S2S forecasting. Thus S2S forecasting serves as both a motivation and an ideal testbed for seamless prediction systems. In operational settings, seamless prediction has the potential to reduce manpower costs of maintaining several models to produce operational fo recasts with various lead times, and the practice and benefit of seamless prediction systems have been dem onstrated by several successful efforts (Brown et al., 2012; Hazeleger et al., 2010; Vitart et al., 2008). The UK Met Office uses its main atmospheric model at all timescales, the Navy is developing NEPTUNE , a possible next generation unified global-regional prediction system, and NCEP has proposed a similar path with the selection of its next operational atmospheric model. Recent advancement in modeling has helped to meet some challenges to building seamless prediction systems (Brown et al., 2012). For example, the issue of scale dependence of parameterization is being tackled using new schemes that are scale aware or independent (see above). Across multiple U.S. agencies, the Earth System Pred iction Suite (Theurich et al., 2015 ) is working to develop a common modeling infrastructure and compone nt interface standards for a suite of national weather and climate models, which, while not providi ng seamless prediction, will facilitate greater use of common components and more rapid transition of new technology. framework for reducing such erro rs and developing new parameterizations may be useful (see Box 5.2 for a description of seamless prediction). 38 Note that \"seamless forecasts\" discussed in Chapter 3 refe rs to creating products that are consistent across short range, subseasonal, seasonal, and climate timescales.

Advances in S2 S systems can benefit tremendously from the experience of weather, ocean, and climate mode l developers, and vice versa. New high-order computational schemes and implementations that minimize numerical diffusion on S2S timescales are needed for multi-resolution ocea n and atmospheric modeling. Developing these computational schemes jointly with new uncertainty quantification and data assimilation capabilities would be an efficient path forward: It would directly in tegrate three critical components of S2S forecasting systems from the start. There are several crucial steps that need to be taken in parallel to reduce model errors. First, research to systematically quantify a nd understand the improvements that can be made through modest increases in resolution (horizon tal, vertical, and mu lti-resolution, and across coupled components) is needed to help determ ine the optimal design of operational systems (e.g., trade-offs between costs and benefits of increas ed resolution, ensembles, parameterizations, and multimodels\u2014see Recommendation J described in the next section). For ocean models in particular, there may be benefit for including robust, advanced, and highly conservative multi-resolution approaches (adaptive mesh refine ment, seamless two-way nesting, multi-dynamics, adaptive super-parameterizations, etc.) for ope rational global S2S for ecasting over the next decade. Some emerging research further suggest s that there may be important gains from concurrent increases in resolution up to the po int of resolving mesoscale processes across the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land surface. However, research into how increased resolution can reduce model biases, especial ly in coupled ESM models, is just beginning and needs further support (e.g., NOAA, 2015). Ideall y, continued research on the t opic of model resolution needs to be carried out with more than one S2S forecas t system in order to be sure that the lessons learned are generic. Second and perhaps most importantly, it is clea r that uncertainties in parameterizations of unresolved processes\u2014both processe s internal to a given Earth system component and in the representation of coupled processe s between them\u2014are and will con tinue to be major sources of model errors. Thus efforts to improve parameteri zation of many processes must be one of the highest priorities for improving S2S prediction systems. The difficulties in improving parameterization arise from both incomplete process understanding and failure to properly encapsulate process knowledge into paramete rization schemes of operational S2S systems. Acceleration of both process understanding and the transfer of knowledge into model development are thus essential. New field observations are critical to improving process understanding and the development of subgrid scale parameterizations . Given the complexity of S2S models, which involve multiple, interacting components of the Ea rth system, it is critical to understand coupling processes between different components as well as interactive processes within components. Particular foci for new field campaigns and pr ocess studies should include tropical convection, ocean turbulence, sea ice, stratospheric and la nd surface processes, and coupling among different Earth system components (land, ice, ocean, and at mosphere). Observations of coupled processes between components are particul arly useful for monitoring a nd initializing S2S prediction systems. They are also essential for model valida tion and the identification of bias/error sources in coupled Earth system models. Spatial covera ge of this type of observation (e.g., tropical mooring arrays, land surface flux towers) remain s inadequate and faces deterioration.

Transforming new knowledge gained from fi eld observations and process studies to model improvement requires close collaboration among experts on observations, data analysis, and modeling. Persistent and painstaking efforts among two generations of scientists has been necessary to advance ESMs and operational foreca st systems to the point at which they are today, and it will take no less to reach our goals for S2S forecasting. Teams that allow scientists with diverse expertise to collabo rate effectively are necessary to accelerate this transformation (such as NSF/NOAA Climate Process Teams), and it is crucial to further develop an enhanced, sustainable community of scient ists spanning academic, researc h, and operational centers to develop, test, and optimize new parameterization schemes (see also Chapter 6). Finally, improving subgrid scale parameterizatio n needs to be supported by research that explores the benefits of extremely fine resolu tions (meters to a few kilometers), even though these are unlikely to be affordable or computationa lly feasible operationally in the next ten years. For atmosphere models, this would involve global or large-domain cloud-permitting grid spacing without the need of deep cumulus parameteri zation and regional larg e-eddy simulation (LES) models without the need of shallow cumulus parameterization. For ocean models, this would include explicitly representing submesocale features and possibl y non-hydrostatic processes such as wave-induced circulation and mixing. The deve lopment and exploitation of such extremely high-resolution model systems should be encourag ed, and they should be used to advance the study of S2S predictability (Chapter 4), generate high-resolution datasets fo r process studies, and provide testbeds to improve, develop, and ev aluate parameterization schemes, as well as demonstrate possible future S2S predicti on systems (see also Recommendation I). Recommendation H: Accelerate research to improve parameterization of unresolved (e.g., subgrid scale) processes, both within S2S syst em submodels and holistically across models, to better represent coupling in the Earth system. Specifically: Foster long-term collaborations among scie ntists across academia and research and operational modeling centers, and across ocean, sea ice, land and atmospheric observation and modeling communities, to identify root causes of error in parameterization schemes, to correct these er rors, and to develop, test, and optimize new (especially scale-aware or independent) pa rameterization schemes in a holistic manner. Continue to investigate the potential for reducing model errors through increases in horizontal and vertical reso lutions in the atmosphere and other model components, ideally in a coupled model framew ork (see also Recommendation L). Encourage field observations targeted at increasing knowledge of poorly understood or poorly represented processes in S2S models , including tropical convection, ocean mixing, polar, sea ice and stratospheric processes, and coupling among different Earth system components (e.g., air-sea-i ce-wave-land, troposphere- stratosphere, dynamics- biogeochemistry).

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 148 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY process understanding and to promote the development of high-resolution operational prototypes (see also Recommendation I). Representing oceans, sea ice, land surf ace and hydrology, and biogeochemical cycles (including aerosol and air quality ) in coupled Earth system mode ls is more important for S2S predictions than for traditional w eather prediction because much of the predictability of the Earth system on these timescales arises from conditions outside the troposphere or from interactions between Earth system components. However, the representation of processes outside the troposphere has generally been le ss well developed in Earth system models used for making S2S forecasts. Thus improving model representation of land surface and terrestrial hydrology, ocean, sea ice, and upper atmosphere\u2014including fluxes and feedbacks between these components and the troposphere\u2014should be central to the S2S re search agenda. For example, improving the representation of land surface processes such as soil moisture storage and snow may be important for predicting events such as heat wa ves, cold surges, storm formation, and predicting run-off may help to enable S2S forecasts of flooding and lake and coastal hypoxia. Similarly, connecting advances in cutting-edge sea ic e models (including sophisticated physics representations of ice-th ickness distribution, melt ponds, biogeochemistry, and divergence/convergence, as well as new methods to account for wave-floe interactions, blowing snow, and ice microstructure) with sea ice mode ls used in S2S forecast system could advance S2S predictions of the atmosphere through im proved representation of radiative and ocean feedbacks, as well as advancing S2S prediction of sea ice and polar ocean conditions. As demand grows for forecasts of phenomena that are predictable on S2S timescales but that do not feedback strongly to the atmosphere, improving the dynami cal representation of many of these Earth system processes in S2S prediction systems ma y also become important in its own right. As coupled systems become increasingly co mplex and the linkages between variables expand, the uncertainty in coupled model output increases, particularly for downstream products. Understanding the nonlinear ways in which these un certainties can interact should be a key area of focus. Utilizing recently developed reduced -order methods described above, which predict and quantify uncertainty across models directly using model equations th emselves, would thus be useful (Smith et al., 2014). Beyond advancing the representation of the la nd surface, hydrology, stratosphere, sea ice, ocean, and biogeochemical models and translating these advancements to the Earth system models used for S2S forecasting, efforts are n eeded to pave the way towards global cloud/eddy- resolving atmosphere-ocean-land-sea ice coup led models, which will one day become operational for S2S prediction. While this goal is unlikely to be reached in the next decade, revolutions in the computing i ndustry may shorten the distance between now and the otherwise long way to go, and the S2S research community n eeds to be proactive and poised if/when that happens. Substantial research is needed in se veral specific areas to ready global cloud/eddy- resolving models for operation. Fi rst, models' dynamic cores need to be made more efficient to take the advantage of new computer technol ogy (Chapter 7). Second, new parameterization schemes needed at cloud/eddy-resolving resoluti ons must be advanced. Third, probabilistic predictability on cloud/eddy-resolving scales woul d be different from that based on models of coarse resolutions, especially for some extreme events, which require additional studies. Finally, cloud/eddy-resolving (or permitting) models will not replace the need for multimodel ensembles (MME). Considering the huge demand on comp uting capability, cloud/eddy-resolving MME needs to be approached through internat ional collaboration and coordination.

COMBINATION, CALIBRATION, VERIFI CATION AND OPTIMIZATION OF S2S FORECAST SYSTEMS As discussed in previous sections, there will always be uncertainties in observations that are used to initialize S2S systems and in the parameters and equations used to represent processes. The net result is biases and errors in the forecast. Significant effort has gone into reducing systematic model errors and biases in Ea rth system prediction systems, and these efforts must continue in order for S2S forecasts to adva nce. However, uncertainties in initial conditions and model formulations are certain to remain fo r the foreseeable future. This necessitates the careful assessment of uncertainti es and efforts to account for them (e.g., ensemble prediction and other methods of uncertainty quantification), and st atistical post-processing to adjust forecasts so that systematic biases are reduced (calibration) . Both are essential for improving the reliability and skill of S2S forecasts, and along with efforts to improve forecast verifi cation, are critical to advance. This section highlights some recent advances and challenges in improving forecast skill through ensemble forecasting and calibration. It al so covers technical aspects of forecast verification\u2014the process of comparing forecasts with observations in order to test forecasts' reliability, measure their skill, assess their value, and develop bias corrections. Given the range of possible methods and options for improving forecast skill through such techniques, this section also discusses the optim ization of forecast systems through an exploration of costs and benefits of various forecast system configurations.

This change in prediction strategy naturally follows fr om the fact that climate variability includes a chaotic or irregular component, and because of this, forecasts must include a quantitative assessment of this uncertainty. More importa ntly, the prediction community now understands that the potential utility of forecasts is ba sed on end-user decision uptake and utilization (Challinor et al., 2005; Morse et al., 2005; Pa lmer et al., 2000), whic h requires probabilistic forecasts that include quantitative informati on regarding forecast uncer tainty or reliability. Ensembles of perturbed initial observational values are now commonly used to represent uncertainty associated with model initial condi tions; however, the number of ensembles and the method of ensemble creation vary widely acro ss operational systems (Appendix B, Tables B.1 and B.2). Little systematic work has been done to evaluate the costs and benefits of different ensemble sizes and methods in re lation to other investments. In addition to uncertainty in initialization, unc ertainty quantification is also necessary to account for uncertainty associated with model fo rmulation. A number of methods exist or are under development to try and account for this ty pe of uncertainty. Perturbed physics ensembles (currently in use at the Met Office for thei r operational system) or stochastic physics (e.g., Berner et al., 2008; Berner et al., 2011) appear to be quite promising for representing some aspects of model uncertainty (e.g., Weisheimer et al., 2011, and see section above on Data Assimilation). The multi-model ensemble (MME) approach, in which forecasts are made from an ensemble of separate models, has been the most widely tested and implemented of such methods. As also discussed in Chapter 2, a number of routine MME S2S forecasts are currently issued: The Canadian Meteorological Centre has been producing ope rational MME seasonal forecasts using two coupled models since 2011. 39 Seasonal MME forecasts are also being produced at the APCC every month based on data collected from 17 operational centers and research institutions (see Box 2.1). The North American Multi-Mode l Ensemble (NMME) is approaching quasi- operational status on the seasona l scale, and planning for subs easonal capabilities is at the beginning stages (see Box 2.2). Forecasts from these and other MMEs, which include multiple operational and/or research models, generally achiev e a better skill and reliability than individual models (Kirtman, 2014; Kirtman et al., 2014; Min et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2009c; Weisheim er et al., 2009), although in so me cases, only marginal skill improvement has been achieved when verifying the ensemble mean (e.g., Doblas-Reyes et al., 2000; Doblas-Reyes et al., 2009; Weisheimer et al., 2009). The precise reasons for these improvements in skill are not totally clear, but when separate prediction systems are combined into a single prediction system of systems, model-and data-induced errors or uncertainty tend to cance l out, which improves the overall probabilistic distribution of likely outcomes (D oblas-Reyes et al., 2005; Hagedor n et al., 2005; Palmer et al., 2004; Palmer et al., 2008). Different model configurat ions, along with different 39 http://weather.gc.ca/saisons/index_ e.html, accessed January 27, 2016. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 5: S2S Forecast Systems: Capabilities, Gaps, and Potential 151 PREPUBLICATION COPY parameterizations and physics likely both play a role in this reducti on of error: forecast models in different operational centers and institutions ha ve different configurations (e.g., resolutions, physics parameterization schemes, strategies for initialization, ensemble, coupling, and retrospective forecasts). Multi-model ensemble ( MME) forecasts likely cover a more complete probability distribution than a single model becaus e of these different configurations and also because different models tend to have their ow n strengths in capturing different sources of predictability. Thus forecast skill improvement may also come from combination of different signals. Despite their current value and future prom ise for further improving S2S forecasts, there are a number of important gaps in our understanding of MMEs and how to assemble them strategically. Currentl y, MMEs are largely systems of oppor tunity, not systems made through careful design (Sandgathe et al., 2013). Furtherm ore, there are tradeoffs between developing independent multiple models and focusing resources on one system, including focusing on other methods of capturing uncertainty associated w ith model formulation. A further challenge for MMEs is how to combine models with unequal sk ill (Sandgathe et al., 2013). Different methods have been used to combine multi-model ensemble s for deterministic and probabilistic forecasts, including simple averaged MMEs where the contri bution of each model is equally weighted and empirically weighted MMEs using multiple linear regressions. The relative skill of forecast models can also be used to weight the contribut ions of each model to th e multi-ensemble, either point-by-point or over larger regions. The choice of met hod may depend on parameters, locations, and applications. Fo r example, Kharin and Ziwers (2003) found that for 500-hPa geopotential height forecasts, the simple ensemble mean produces the most skillful forecasts in the tropics, whereas the regressi on-improved ensemble mean performs best in the extratropics, and the MME forecast that is obtained by optimally weighting the individual ensemble members does not perform as well as either the simple ensemble mean or the regression-improved ensemble mean. In the case of the APCC MME (Box 2.1), products are generated using a number of methods, including simple equal weig ht for all members, empirically weighted coefficients, and probabilistic forecast. In th is case, simple averaged MMEs generally outperform MMEs of other weightin g methods over most latitudina l zones for all variables and seasons (Min et al., 2014). Finding 5.33: Although perturbed physics and other methods continue to be studied and implemented, given current modeling capabilities , a multi-model strategy is a practical and relatively simple approach for quantifying fo recast uncertainty du e to errors in model formulation, although optimal methods for co mbining models are not always clear, and MMEs will not fully account for forecast uncertainty. Calibration of S2S Probability Forecasts Calibration is a post-process th at uses statistical methods based on discrepancies between past forecasts and observations to adjust ensemb le forecasts and improve forecast skill. Today, all operational S2S models include a number of ensemble members whose individual forecasts can be arranged to estimate probability distribu tions for the predicted va riables, point-by-point across the forecast grid. However, in their origin al form, the statistical characteristics of S2S forecasts often differ from those of the environmen tal features they attempt to predict. The aim Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 152 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY of calibration or post-processing of model output is to remove th ese systematic errors and to reshape the predicted probability distribution so that it resembles as closely as possible the distributions that will be found wh en the forecasts are verified. Calibration processes are developed by comp aring forecasts made with the current prediction model to actual observations for as many cases as possible ov er a historical period (retrospective forecasts or \"reforecasts\"), usua lly ten to thirty years for S2S forecasts. The comparison produces statistical information that is used in calibration algorithms to ensure that the long-term statistical moments (mean, variance, spread, etc.) of the forecast at any given lead time match the long-term observed statistical variabilit y. Some calibration methods are based on the Bayesian model averaging approach propos ed by Raftery et al. (2005), including those described by Dutton et al. (2013). Other methods fo cus on more direct adju stment of variances, including those of Doblas-Reyes et al. (2005) and Johnson and Bowler (2009). S2S ensembles are often under-dispersive and the calibrati on methods usually amplify the variance to correspond more closely to the observed variance. Statistical-dynamical (S -D) techniques, e.g., model output st atistics (MOS), can be very beneficial for improving model calibrations wher e the models cannot capture all the processes that are occurring. For example, the tropical cyclone forecast community has used S-D techniques for a number of years, where the dyna mics involved in hurricane track and intensity are not completely understood. Anal og techniques have shown fewer uses but may have value in helping to capture uncertainty, potentially reducing model retrosp ective forecast requirements and reducing or eliminating the need for additional models (Hamill et al., 2006). In practice, the calibration of S2S forecasts is not a well-organized process, and there is no single approach that works best for all applic ations. The forecast centers provide the forecasts and corresponding retrospective or historical forecast sets and frequently provide some calibration. Commercial providers or other users also of ten compute and apply their own calibrations in order to enhance skill or target specific applications. Looking forward, as more of the components of the Earth system are included in the models, the challenges of model calibration will intensify\u2014not least due to the need for more comprehensive and long-record observations across components of the Earth system. The atmospheric, ocean, land, and ice models evol ve towards their own model climate and do not necessarily combine and converg e on the actual Earth system climate. For example, as mentioned in earlier in this chapter (Figure 5.7) , SST errors in coupled model simulations with the UK Met Office model grow rapidly. Identif ying model error and compensating for model tendencies will continue to be a key activity in S2S model development and operation. Finding 5.34: Calibration of S2S probability forecasts is a critic al process in preparing the forecasts to serve users. Forecast centers, pr ivate sector users, and value-added providers use various calibration methods, but there has been no comprehensive effort to compare methods or to find optimum approaches for the variables of most interest . Ascertaining whether some methods offer clear advantage over others would be useful. Verification of Forecasts and Metrics of Model Skill Proper verification of forecasts is critical to all aspects of model improvement, system design, ensemble configuration, and the determ ination use and value by decision makers. A Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 5: S2S Forecast Systems: Capabilities, Gaps, and Potential 153 PREPUBLICATION COPY variety of options exist for verifying and estimati ng the skill of S2S probability forecasts. Some are related to atmospheric or oceanic phenomena and some to quantities of interest to users such as the financial consequences of hedging when adverse conditions are predicted. A standard approach is to estimate model skill through anomal y correlations or root -mean-square errors of common meteorological variables such as temperature and pr ecipitation (see Figure 2.4). Although such metrics have been used for decades, they provide only a limited view of forecast skill. They are traditionally carried out on a grid-point-by-grid-point, variable-by-variable basis, and often do not provide a comprehensive picture of model or forecast skill (Brown et al., 2004; Brown et al., 2002). Significant recent research has been devot ed to improved veri fication techniques, targeted mainly at very high resolution mesoscal e predictions and also at ensemble predictions (Gilleland et al., 2010), yet sign ificant research op portunities exist for improving verification beneficial to S2S prediction. For S2S prediction, as in mesoscale prediction where predictability limits are an issue (e.g., thundersto rms or tornadoes), the opportuni ty exists for feature-based prediction in which skill is meas ured not on a grid-point by grid- point basis, but on the basis of predicting larger features (ENS O, MJO, NAO, warm SST pools, sea ice extent, etc.) within the Earth system (Cornuelle et al., 2014). Put anot her way, while model skill in predicting surface wind at a point one to three months in advance ma y be lacking, as discussed in Chapter 2, certain structures and indices are predic table at these timescales and ha ve verifiable at tributes using newer object-oriented, feature ve rification techniques (Gilleland et al., 2010). These techniques are just recently being extended to ensemble prediction (Gallus, 2010; Johnson et al., 2013) and potentially provide a means for credible verification of feature skill for S2S predictions. Successful prediction and verifica tion of S2S \"features\" also leads to a two-step process of prediction and verification wh ere successful predicti on of a \"feature\" can be correlated to a likely environmental event for a user, e.g., strong EN SO leads to increased rainfall in California by shifting the location of the subt ropical jet and tropical flow of moisture further east (WMO, 2015a). However, location, areal extent and intens ity of the SST anomaly determine the location and intensity of rainfall. Potentially, using f eature-based verification as an example (Box 5.3), this could be refined to correlate intensity and location of ENSO anomalous SST to more refined watershed regions of rainfall. Cl early, predictability limits are a factor here; however, there is significant user value if, through proper verifi cation, accurate probabilitie s can be assigned to user-critical events or thresholds. More challenging is the verifi cation of forecasts of rare events at S2S timescales (Hitchens et al., 2013). Credible reanalysis or retrospective forecast history is limited to approximately forty years, providing a small sample for verification of long-range predictions of extreme or rare events. Techniques for verifying ensemble predictions of rare events are being explored (Gneiting and Ranja n, 2011); however, longer data r ecords are required to provide credible validation and verification. Finding 5.35: Aggregating observations into features or indices provides added S2S predictability. Feature-based or object-oriented verification, especially ensemble feature-based verification, needs to be pursued for S2S to support Earth system model development and forecast calibration and validation. Finding 5.36: Two-step verifica tion inde x, or object to a user-valued event shows promise for extrac ting useful signal at the limits of predictability.

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 154 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY BOX 5.3\u2014Feature-Based Verification Feature-based verification as proposed by Brown, et. al., 2002 has been heavily researched for mesoscale prediction over the past decade with several devel oped methodologies, including wavelet techniques, empirical orthogonal functions, and clustering (Gilleland et al 2010). A \"feature\" for mesoscale prediction can represent both temporal and spatial features that ar e recognizable and that have societally relevant consequences, such as a mesoscale cl oud cluster, an area of heavy precipitation, or duration of extreme winds, or it may be a combination of these attributes. Conceptually, we understand a \"hurricane\" as a feature, but it can be defined as an area of cloud cove r, rainfall, a radius of winds exceeding a threshold, or a moving point of maximum wind. For S2S, a \"feature\" might be an area of SST anomalies that exists in both time and space (e.g. ENSO), an area of severe dr ought defined by rainfall, temperature, area, and temporal extent, or an area of sea ice coverage. Ma ny indices discussed in the preceding chapters such as ENSO, PDO, MJO, etc., are roughly based on features. Feature-based verification has the advantage that it can \"recognize\" and verify a feature that may occur sli ghtly earlier or late, may cover a smaller or larger area, may be more or less intense, may be of shorter or longer duration, etc., than predicted. This enables more accurate quantitative evaluation of model pe rformance in \"near miss\" situations and better refinement of model skill and reliability. Feature-base d verification also has the advantage that is an aggregation of model variables in space and time and c onsequently has greater predictability that a single variable at a single grid-point (see also Chapter 2). Research to develop feature- based verification techniques wi ll be important, but it is important not to lose track of the fact that verifi cation metrics are a critical part of building trust in the use of forecasts, and the design of metrics that are effective for users can also help drive model development in directions th at lead to enhancements in sk ill that are most beneficial to decision makers (Hartmann et al., 2002; Morss et al., 2008; Pagano et al., 2002). The need to develop verification metrics that ar e more closely associated with user needs and desired forecast products, such as quantities that may be more di rectly used by the energy, transportation, hazard, water, and agriculture sectors, among others, in combination with the need to develop common S2S-specific forecast skill metrics to target core physical characteristics of the forecast that are particularly relevant to S2S processes and timescales (e.g. SST, sea ice thickness, upper level atmospheric flow, soil moisture, upper ocean heat content, etc., in addition to indices of S2S relevant modes of variability), highlights the ne ed for a community-wide effort to develop skill and verification metrics that will build user trust while also driving the development of S2S forecast systems in directions that most benefi cial to society. An unders tanding of the different ways in which users interpret forecasts and what th ey consider to be skillful is clearly necessary to inform the types of evaluation metrics that wi ll influence use of forecasts (see Chapter 3). In developing such common skill and verification metrics, attention is also needed to ensure that such metrics reflect appropriate and optimal comb inations of spatial and temporal averaging as the lead time increases from weeks to seasons . Thus developing this range of verification metrics/diagnostics targeting S2S forecast skil l improvements, dissemination, and monitoring will require input from, and dialogue among, th e operational, resear ch and stakeholder communities (see also Chapters 3 and 6). In some cases, there already exist forums where such a dialogue can begin. For subseasonal prediction, for example, the S2S Project has begun a process to develop common and community-accepted verifi cation and process-oriented skill metrics for forecast systems. Finding 5.37: Meeting the objectives to increase the skill of S2S forecasts by improving and expanding the representation of the physical sy stem and expanding their utility will require a Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 5: S2S Forecast Systems: Capabilities, Gaps, and Potential 155 PREPUBLICATION COPY community-wide process with operational, resear ch and stakeholder involvement, to develop common S2S forecast skill and verification metrics, as well as process-oriented diagnostics that target S2S processes and phenomena. Often decision makers simply want to know wh ether to have confidence in a particular forecast. Should I act on the basis of this foreca st? What are the expected consequences if I do? In these cases, effective use of the forecast in decision making requires quantitative knowledge of historical performance of th e forecast system in order to link predictions with expected outcomes, i.e., \"If I act on this forecast, then I can expect...\" In thes e cases, a quantitative business model or decision process model based on predicted probabilities will then dictate the appropriate measure of model skil l. For example, a simple business model for characterizing the effect of warm or cold seasons on electric utilities demonstrates that the critical model performance statistics for analyzing the impact of forecasts (in order to mitigate such predicted adverse events) are the climatological and predicte d frequencies of such events, along with the fraction of adverse forecasts that are correct (Dutton et al., 2015). Verification metrics are most useful when d ecision makers are involved in their design (see also Chapter 3 and Recommendation B), and for many users, th e success of the S2S forecasts is directly proportional to the favorab le results achieved by acting on the forecast at various predicted probabilities. Knowing whethe r to act on a forecast requires detailed and reliable statistics about forecast performance that must be obtained from retrospective forecasts. These retrospective forecasts, then, can be as important to effective user decisions as the forecasts themselves. In most current operational S2S systems, howe ver, there is inconsistency between real- time forecasts and retrospective forecasts in initi alization as well as ensemble size (Appendix B, Tables B.1 and B.2). Furthermore, retrospective fo recasts are usually initialized from reanalysis, which can be inconsistent with the state-of-art op erational analysis used to initialize the real-time forecasts. This is particularly true for the land surface (e.g., soil moisture and snow). Such inconsistency, particularly the inconsistency in initialization and model configuration for real- time forecasts and retrospective forecasts, can gene rate anomalies with amplitude as large as the signal we want to predict. Finally, the full probabilistic information cont ained in the ensemble forecast is essential to decision making, as emphasized by Dutton et al (2013; 2015). Anomaly correlations or root- mean-square errors use only one or two statisti cal moments and may or may not be relevant to decisions to act. The critical que stion is the extent to which predicted probabilities model the frequencies of occurrence in the verification data. Thus in S2S forecasts, it is important to conve y the associated forecast skill to users along with the forecast itself. In addition to providing data for calibration, retr ospective forecasts are used to evaluate forecast skill of the S2S system . When retrospective for ecasts are made with the same fixed version of model and same ensemble number as the forecast, forecast skill of the system can be more easily assessed with the re trospective forecast data. For those systems doing retrospective forecasts on the fly, the assessmen t of forecast skill can be more challenging. In these cases, conducting retrospective forecasts with a full set of ensemble members and evaluating the skill once a month could be benefi cial. This is true for most of the current operational subseasonal forecast systems. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 156 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY Finding 5.38 : Retrospective forecasts using the current version of the forecast system and up to date reanalyses are important for advancing calibra tion and validation efforts of ensemble prediction. The Way Forward for Model Calibration, Combin ation, Verification, and Optimization of User-Focused Skill A key conclusion of this section is that the value of S2S forecasts is proportional to the success of the users in acting on the forecasts to ta ke advantage of opportunity or to mitigate risk. Thus the two key components are the forecasts that look to the future and the retrospective forecasts, which inform users what to expect if they act on the for ecast. The success of the forecasts also depends on the calibration processe s that shape predicted probability distributions to improve the likelihood they will match the ve rification data. Underpinni ng this is a the need for a credible verification methodol ogy that reflects the aggrega ting of observations to extend predictability, the spatial and temporal variabilit y of predictability at S2S timescales, and the unique characteristics of multi-model ensembles. The opportunity exists for feat ure-based predictions with S2S lead times. The community is gaining the ability to predict certain featur es, structures, or indices (MJO, ENSO, sea ice extent, etc.) at S2S timescales and have verifi able attributes using newer object-oriented verification techniques, with exte nsions to ensemble prediction. Th ere is the poten tial to provide credible verification of feature skill for S2S predictions, and the Committee believes that this is an important direction to be pursued. Recommendation J: Pursue feature-based verific ation techniques in order to more readily capture limited predictability at S2S timescale s, as part of a larger effort to improve S2S forecast verification. Specifically: Investigate methodologies for ensemble feature verification including two-step processes linking features to critical user criterion. Pursue verification methodologies for rare and extreme events at S2S timescales, especially those related to multi-model ensemble predictions. Consider the benefits of producing more frequent reanalyses using coupled S2S forecast systems in order for the initial c onditions of retrospec tive forecasts to be more consistent with the real time fo recasts, as well as for the purposes of predictability studies. Optimization of the Configurat ions of S2S Forecast Systems As is clear from the supporting paragraphs above, S2S forecast systems, including the coupled Earth system model, the reanalysis, and retrospective forecasts, ca n be configured in a wide variety of ways. Designing and implementing a S2S forecast system to operate within finite computing resources always requires trade-offs between spatial resolution, length of forecast lead times, coupled system complexity, th e number of model forecast systems for MME Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 5: S2S Forecast Systems: Capabilities, Gaps, and Potential 157 PREPUBLICATION COPY approaches, and the number of ensemble me mbers in each forecast system. Thus, the specifications can vary widely over a c onfiguration space of these parameters. Today the S2S community has little sense of how forecast performance depends on that configuration (Cornuelle et al., 2014; Sandgathe et al., 2013). In a ddition to research on reducing model errors through parameterizat ions, increases in model resolu tion, and adding complexity in coupled submodels, it would be enormously benefi cial to ascertain whic h configurations can produce optimum forecast systems, as defined by re liable probability forecasts across a wide spectrum of climate variability and Earth syst em variables and by optimum levels of user- focused skill. Although the focus of this report to this point has been on developing dynamical predictions, such an assessment should also consid er the value of lower-order models and analog methods for reducing computational cost s while maintaining prediction skill. This determination of how performance depends on configuration is a central key task in any S2S research agenda. Exploring the configuration space (or \"trade space\") of S2S forecast systems will be a large, complicated, and expe nsive endeavor, expanding as computer and Earth system modeling capabilities expand over the next decade or more. Such an experiment would benefit tremendously from a central, coordinatin g authority, and preferably central funding as well (see discussion in Chapter 6). This work to optimize system configuration is essential to progress today, but it will also never be complete. New methods for representi ng physical processes (Recommendation H), new computer capabilities (Chapter 7), and new calib ration strategies all wi ll mandate a continued search for trajectories through the model and fo recast system configuration space that are most advantageous to improving S2S forecast skill and use. Exploring the \"trade-space\" thus represents a major and long-term research effort, undoubtedly distributed through the modeling comm unity, which will provide a foundation for the continuing development and improvement of the operational forecast systems to be considered in the next chapter. In summary, the Committee has defined users acting on forecasts as a key metric for measuring S2S success, and we recommend a continuing search for configurations of S2S forecast systems that w ill optimize the probabilistic information required by users. Recommendation K: Explore systematically the im pact of various S2S forecast system design elements on S2S forecast skill. This includes examining the value of mo del diversity, as well as the impact of various selections and combinations of model re solution, number of ensemble perturbations, length of lead, averaging period, le ngth of retrospective forecasts, and options for coupled sub-models. Specifically: Design a coordinated program to assess the co sts and benefits of including additional processes in S2S systems, and relate those to benefits from other investments, for example in higher resolution. In doing so, take advantage of the oppor tunity to leverage experience and codes from the climate modeling community. Encourage systematic studies of the costs a nd benefits of increas ing the vertical and horizontal resolution of S2S models. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

As described in Chapter 3, there is an increasing demand for easily accessible and comprehe nsible S2S forecasting information that is updated on a regular basis, which provides an increasing demand for operational S2S products. As described in Chapter 4, there is ongoing prog ress to identify and characterize sources of predictability for S2S forecasts. As described in Chapter 5, the models that have been developed as research tools to study scien tific questions regarding the pro cesses responsible for weather and ocean variability, climate change, and predicta bility are being improve d at a rapid pace (e.g., Delworth et al., 2006; Gent et al., 2011; Kiehl et al., 1998). Any strategy to improve the provision of operational S2S products needs to incorporate the effi cient migration of advances from the research community into operational forecasts (NRC, 2012b). A key part of the interface betw een research and operations wi ll need to take into account the interaction between the rese arch and operational communities . There is a natural tension between the academic research community and the operational forecasting community. Researchers within the academic community are generally rewarded for exploring new concepts, as scientific journals often fa vor publications that are viewed as making major advancements as opposed to incremental changes. Forecasters in the operational community are often under pressure to maintain a natural conservati sm. Because numerous users depend on operational forecasts and invest in using sp ecific outputs, there is pressure on the forecasters to maintain consistency in their forecast products. This tens ion can be healthy, but some of these cultural differences between the two communities can im pede dialogue and coll aboration. Facilitating work across this interface between research and operations needs to start by acknowledging these cultural differences. This chapter describes several ongoing effo rts to promote collaboration across the research and operational communities both in the United States and elsewhere. The topic of forging better links between research and operations in climate modeling was covered comprehensively in a recent NRC report (N RC, 2012b), and the Committee builds upon rather than repeats the highly relevant but more general findings of that report here. Thus in this Chapter, the Committee makes the case for severa l recommendations that are more specific to the S2S context. In particular, because of thei r importance in reducing unc ertainty and increasing the skill and reliability of S2S forecasts (Chapt er 5), the Committee's emphasis is on research to operations related to the development of Mu lti-model Ensemble forecast systems (MMEs). CURRENT ACTIVITIES AT THE INTERFACE OF S2S RESEARCH AND OPERATIONS There are a number of efforts, both nationa lly and internationally, that work at the interface of research and operations in S2S fo recasting.

This section describe s in greater detail several prominent efforts, highlighting their importance for bridging research and operations, particularly in the area of developing MME prediction systems; it is not intended as a comprehensive list. Demonstration MME S2S Forecast Systems As introduced and described in Chapter 2 th ere are a number of in ternational efforts aimed at improving MMEs and issuing MME forecasts in demonstration mode. The North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME-40) (B ox 2.2) is a demonstration project for S2S prediction involving univers ities and laboratories in the Unite d States, NCEP, and the Canadian Meteorological Center. It is supported largely through resear ch dollars from NOAA, NSF, NASA, and DOE. Participating modeling groups in clude both operational and research centers 41, with forecasts from each provided to the NOAA Climate Prediction Center for evaluation and consolidation as an experimental multi -model ensemble S2S prediction system. Phase 2 of the project focuses on bridging re search and operations, and requirements for operational S2S prediction are used to define the specifications of a rigorous retrospective forecast experiment and evaluation regime. Other more specific goals of the NMME-2 experiment include (Kirtman, 2014): i. Build on existing state-of-the-art U.S. clim ate prediction models and data assimilation systems that are already in use in NMME-1 (as well as upgraded versions of these forecast systems), introduce a new forecast sy stem, and ensure interoperability so as to easily incorporate future model developments. ii. Take into account operational forecast requir ements (forecast frequency, lead time, duration, number of ensemble members, etc.) and regional/use r-specific needs. A focus of this aspect of the experiment will be the hydrology of various regions in the United States and elsewhere in order to address drought and extreme event prediction. An additional focus of NMME-2 will be to develop and evaluate a protocol for intraseasonal or subseasonal multi-model prediction. iii. Utilize the NMME system expe rimentally in a near-operational mode to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of running such a system as part of NOAA's operations. iv. Enable rapid sharing of quality-controlle d retrospective forecast data among the NMME team members and develop proce dures for timely and open access to the data, including documentation of models and forecast procedures, by the broader climate research and applications community. The Asia-Pacific Climate Center (APCC [Box 2.1]) is a joint activity of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation involving 17 ope rational and research centers from nine APEC member countries. It collects dynamic ensemble season al prediction data from these centers, and 40 More information on the National Multi-Model Ensemble is available at http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/product s/NMME/NMME_description.html and https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/ nmme/ (both accessed January 27, 2016). 41 Details of each of the participating models can be found at http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/pr oducts/NMME/Phase1models.png (accessed February 10, 2016).

As part of the project, APCC also conducts research on multi-model ensemble methods, which in turn feed s work to issue MME forecasts using the most beneficial methodology (Min et al. 2014). Through these and other MME research and demonstration efforts (e.g., ENSEMBLES, DEMETER \u2014see Chapter 2), much has been lear ned about MME forecast systems. As also described in Chapter 5, a primary finding has been that MME forecasts in general show improved forecast skill and reliability when compar ed with the individual model forecasts. Thus first and foremost, these demonstration and alig ned research-operational efforts have shown the potential for operational MMEs. Finding 6.1: Previous MME efforts have demons trated MMEs as a viable mechanism for advancing S2S forecasts. Although it is not yet a forecas t demonstration project as both NMME and APCC are, the WWRP/WCRP joint research proj ect\u2014the S2S Project\u2014started in January 2013 with a primary goal to advance subseasonal forecasting by coordina ting prediction and pred ictability research enabled by the establishment of a multi-model data base. The data base consists of ensembles of subseasonal (up to 60 days) forecas ts and supplemented with an extensive set of reforecasts following TIGGE-the THORPEX Interactive Gra nd Global Ensemble-protocols (Box 2.3). Note that while this project leverage s operational systems, the forecasts are currently disseminated with a three-week delay, thus emphasizing the us e of operational forecast system data for use by both the research and operational communities. One advantage of the S2S Project database is the diversity of operational models. However, there is inconsistency among the models in forecast start date, frequency, lead time, and reforecast strategy, which makes it difficu lt for data exchange, performance inter- comparison, and research. This also reflects the fact that the subseasonal forecast is still in its infancy stage. There are significant opportunitie s for leveraging the S2S Proj ect, not only the database but also the associated subproj ect research and activ ities. Most of the subprojects already strongly link to entities and ac tivities outside the S2S Project (e.g., the MJO Subproject links to the WCRP-WWRP's Working Group on Numeri cal Experimentation (WGNE) MJO Task Force). During a recent workshop on Subseasonal Prediction hosted by ECMWF42, in concert with an S2S Project Steering Group meeting, fo r example, a working group discussed and recommended avenues for broader international collaboration that would more fully take advantage of the S2S Project and NMME. These in cluded: 1) the establis hment of a Task Team on S2S process-oriented diagnostics as well as forecast skill verificati on metrics\u2014keeping in mind both model development and st akeholder interests, 2) more routine interaction between the leads of the subseasonal NMME Co re Team, S2S project co-chair s, S2S Verification subproject leads, and WMO Commission for Basic Systems (CBS) leads, 3) joint workshops between NMME, S2S, CBS, etc., 4) coordinated research experimentation, with leadership in part provided by WGNE, etc. Additional recommendations and full details on the above will be given in the final report of the ECWM F workshop expected to be posted in early 2016.

Building on the existing mechanism whereby the LC has access the same S2S database, but without the three-week embargo, could enable a closer synergy between the research community and operational centers' research efforts. Finding 6.2: The S2S Project has begun a pr ocess for archiving data from operational forecast systems and coordinating research usin g these databases to accelerate improvements in subseasonal prediction, as well as play key role in guiding the development of decision support projects. Example R2O Strategies and Arrangements ESPC The National Earth System Prediction Capa bility (ESPC) Inter-A gency program was established in 2010 \"to improve coordination and collaboration across the federally sponsored environmental research and operational prediction communities for the scientific development and operational implementation of improved glob al prediction at the weather to climate interface.\" 43 ESPC advocates for a number of things at the interface of research and operations, including common coupled modeli ng architectures and standardiz ation of data, archives, and forecast skill metrics. As part of ESPC, NOAA and the U.S. Navy use a number of mechanisms to improve the flow of technology into operational weather and ocean systems. These include focused workshops, visiting scientist programs, special se ssions at professional conferences, testbeds and focused transition teams such as the Navy's de velopment- and operations-transition teams and NSF/NOAA's Climate Process Teams. European Efforts The UK Met Office operates a single science pr ogram, covering both weather and climate and both research and transition to operations . This approach, with the same management responsible for all parts, means that R2O challe nges are significantly lessened, in part as the whole program can be designed with R2O in mind. In addition, there is an active science partnerships program, which seeks to entrain de velopments and expertise from international partners and the academic community. The latter is facilitated by relationshi ps with a number of key universities (including jointly funded positions and PhD studentsh ips). There is also a crucial strategic relationship with th e Natural Environment Research Council (who fund much of the academic research in the UK), which enables co-design and co-funding of major research programs such as those developing the next generation dynamical core and working on improvement of the representation of convection in weather and climate m odels.

The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) also has a strongly focused research program, targeted at generating operational improvements. They also host a significant number of visiting scien tists, and host numerous workshops (involving international experts), seminars, and training programs. Finding 6.3: The United States can learn from in ternational efforts to connect research and operations more closely and can build upon curre nt national efforts to coordinate research and operational activities. CHALLENGES IN RESEARCH TO OPER ATIONS (R2O) AND OPERATIONS TO RESEARCH (O2R) Motivated by the growing expectation for gove rnments to provide S2S services (e.g., Dr. Jane Lubchenco's testimony before Congress during the hearings to confirm her as Undersecretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and Administrator of NOAA [Lubchenco, 2009]), there is a desire within the research community to migrate experimental prediction models into operational use, e.g., th e NOAA Climate Test Bed effort to build the NMME (described previously). There is also a desire to improve on operational models by transitioning model components and/or paramete rization schemes from experimental models developed in the broader community. In theo ry, this migration of experimental model components and parameterizations into operational use has the potential to efficiently leverage the U.S. S2S research community and to provide more skillful and comprehensive operational predictions. However, there are gaps between research goals and operational im peratives, e.g., that changing an operational model requires a more caref ul and elaborate process than for a research model. There are also mismatches between re source requirements needed to maintain an operational model and the current distribution of resources between research, development, and operations. There is also a mismatch between the exp ectations of the opera tional NWP and seasonal prediction community and the model research and development comm unity. The principal measure of success of work that is supported by a typical short-term (e.g., three-year) research grant is the number, quality, and imp act of the research publications that result from any project. Researchers receive no reward for developments that become \"operational,\" so there is little incentive to do what is viewed as very substantia l extra work to transform research results into operational methods or procedures. There is a vi ew that the scholarly publications speak for themselves, which has been described as a \"loa ding dock\" approach\u2014the research results are made available to the operational prediction co mmunity via peer review ed publications (left on the loading dock), and it is up to users to figure out how to use the results (see Chapter 7 for more discussion of workforce issues). From the operational commun ity point of view, there are a great many constraints imposed by operations that need to be taken into account by the re searchers who seek to improve operational predictions. In order to effect a transition from research to operations, they argue, the research community needs to modify its develo pments to conform to the constraints of the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 164 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY operational models and resources. However, in order for the research community to use operational models for research, operational center s need to provide infr astructure support for developments to be fully tested in the operati onal environment. The mismatch between the two communities' expectations has been called the \"v alley of death,\" that is, a communication and interaction gap (NRC, 2012b). There is a need to better align the two communities and provide adequate resources so that good ideas can be mo re rapidly and effectively transformed into operational practice. Operations-to-research is a similar issue. In order to make research relevant and focused on scientific issues exposed by operations, operati onal centers must provide access to their data and analysis, access to operational models, and a ccess to multiyear reanalysis and retrospective forecasting runs. In addition, operational and agency development laboratories must provide access to key model developers and software engin eers to facilitate use of code and data by the outside community. These activities are demandi ng for personnel, computational and storage resources, something operationa l centers have traditionally lacked (see also Chapter 7). At the core of the challenges within R2O for S2S is the question of how to expand participation in the development and improvement of the operational prediction systems in the operational centers. Currently, the major route for research results and su ccesses to move into operations is by diffusion through the professional literature and meetings and some focused symposia, like those of ECMWF, for example, Seasonal Prediction in 2012 and Subseasonal Predictability in 2015. Continuation of these efforts is important to continue the transfer of information along the R2O pipeline. However, co mmon access to operational systems and data is a requirement for improving the flow of technology and information. Finding 6.4: There is a clear need to provide the research community with greater access to operational systems or mirror systems to aid in transitioning component, and parameterizations from the research co mmunity into operational centers. WAY FORWARD FOR RESEARCH TO OPERATIONS Over the past two decades, substantial progre ss has been made understanding some of the phenomenological drivers for S2S prediction, and operational centers have made progress in improving S2S forecast skill (see Chapters 2 and 5). However, there is significant opportunity for increased operational skill from current levels in both seasonal and subseasonal forecasts (Chapter 4). Connecting the res earch and operational communities together more effectively is an important part of improving that operati onal skill, and advancing research and quasi- operational prediction systems into operational m ode. Operational centers need to carefully choose which updates to make becau se there are often trade-offs in which improving one type of forecast may come at the expense of another, and users who invest heavily in developing products based on the output from operational centers and rely on th at output being in a specific form. Ensuring that the best research results ge t into operational use and allowing researchers to contribute and learn from the experiences of th e operational centers is an ongoing challenge for the weather/climate community at large (NRC, 2012b). For S2S in particular, there are a few areas that need enhanced a ttention, including planning and wo rk to develop operationalized multi-model S2S forecast systems, providing the S2S research community greater access to the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 6: Interface Between Research and Operations 165 PREPUBLICATION COPY data and models from operational systems, and organizing the operational community to be ready to provide S2S forecasts on the conse quences of large, una nticipated events. Operationalizing MMEs As described in Chapter 5, MMEs have demonstrated a potential for improving the skill and uncertainty quantification of S2S forecasts . Although there are many design considerations that must be addressed to develop the best operational S2S forecast systems (see Recommendation K), it has been established that a multi-model ensemble outperforms a single model ensemble at extended timescales (Kirtma n, 2014; Chapter 5). The Committee believes that all evidence points to the necessity of multi-m odel ensembles for enabling more skillful S2S forecasts in the next decade. Thus a long term goal of the U.S. operational centers should be to develop an operational MME. An immediate question to ask is whethe r the existing North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME; see above) could be built up on to develop a fully operational MME. While the NMME-2 is being used in a quasi-operational mode and providing data that is incorporated into NCEP operational products, external users, and the research commun ity on a near real-time basis, its existence is almost entirely depende nt on research funding. The CFSv2 is the current NCEP operational seasonal prediction system and is supported as such. The Canadian Meteorological Center systems ar e being provided in a demonstration mode, complementary to the U.S. systems. However, all other syst ems in the NMME are supported through federal research funding activities incl uding NOAA Office of Oceanic & At mospheric Research (OAR), NASA, NSF, and DOE. There have been calls to operationalize the NMME; however, in the Committee's view these are misguided. Participants such as universities or research laboratories have little motivation or funding to sustain the provision of 99.9% reliable, on-time data delivery of forecasts with adherence to rigorous softwa re validation and verifi cation or to scheduled software update cycles. Even the more a pplied laboratories such as NASA and NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFD L) do not have the mission, funding, or infrastructure to meet the rigorous require ments imposed upon operational data providers. NMME is funded and intended to provide a\u2014high ly valuable\u2014research vehicle for advancing seasonal prediction and especially for inves tigations into optimal multi-model ensemble configurations. It will be difficult to create a multi-model ensemble in a true operational environment. The value of the multi-model ensemble appear s to be in the differing data assimilation, dynamics, and physical parameterizations of the c ontributing models, which leads to cancelation of model biases and a better as sessment of predicted probability distributions. This implies that an operational system of systems should include distinctly different systems. However, each individual system requires an expensive host of sc ientists and software engineers, especially as computer systems become more complex (Chapter 5). Seasonal forecast systems are also very computationally expensive and would signifi cantly impact a single operational center's computing resources. A critical challenge for the next decade th erefore will be the design and implementation of an operational multi-model S2S forecast system that operates within finite operational resources. Meeting this challenge will require exploring the entire trade space for S2S prediction systems including using common model componen ts (ocean, wave, land, aerosol, ice), using Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Thus, the Committee' s related recommendation above (Recommendation K) is an important step in the process of deliberately designing an operational MME system (and not basing the MME design solely on expediency). Exploring the various options in this space with the goal of optimizing skill while ultimately reducing the number and uniqueness of system members should l ead to a tremendous reduction in the cost of human resources to maintain a multi-model operational system. This exploration of strategies needs to ta ke place within the context of the current NMME, WWRP/WWCRP S2S Project, and/or AP CC S2S forecast efforts, but further demonstration of benefits in increased skill and reliability as part of this exploration will be a key component of the national research agenda for S2S prediction. However, it is critical that the broader research community be engaged in this e ffort. As described for climate models generally (NRC, 2012b), operational centers would best prom ote these advances by providing operational models, supporting data sets, and a user-friendly model te sting environment that allows external researchers to test experimental parameterizatio ns and/or model components in an operational setting. This requires a \"collaborative framew ork where datasets and metrics/targets are standardized for careful intercomparison\" (Sa ndgathe et al., 2013). The NOAA Climate Test Bed activity 44 provides the potential for such a connec tion. In addition, the Next Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS45) is an effort by the National Weat her Service to accelerate R2O for weather forecasting. The current efforts would need significant enhancement to fully address the challenges of designing an operational MME. As described above and in Chapter 5, sy stematic design of a robust multi-model S2S system will be a large, complicated, and expensive experiment, which would benefit tremendously from a central, coordinating authorit y and preferably central funding as well. The various interagency efforts within the U.S. government, for example ESPC described above would be positioned to do this coordination and determine a plan forward with the long-term goal of establishing an operati onal MME. The plan for an oper ational MME could start with models from North American operational centers, but could be expanded to include models from other countries. Recommendation L: Accelerate efforts to carefull y design and create robust operational multi- model ensemble S2S forecast systems. Specifically: Use test beds and interagency and intern ational collaborations where feasible to systematically explore the impact of various S2S forecast system design elements on S2S forecast skill, in particular the question how many and what formulations of unique models are optimum in an operational multi-model ensemble (see also Recommendation K). Assess realistically the available operational resources and centers that are able to contribute to an operational MME. 44 http://www.nws.noaa.gov/ost/CTB /, accessed January 27, 2016. 45 http://www.nws.noaa.gov/ost/ng gps/, accessed January 27, 2016. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 6: Interface Between Research and Operations 167 PREPUBLICATION COPY Provide Research Community with G reater Access to Operational Systems There are a number of ongoi ng activities working at the interface of research and operations (described above). As such, rather th an recommend a wholesale restructuring of the relationship between these communities, the Co mmittee chooses to make several targeted recommendations to help continue progress in this area. That said, the Committee emphasizes that these recommendations will take significant time and effort to accomplish and that they should be viewed as part of a longer term cha llenge to address over th e course of the next decade. As the S2S community looks to bridge S2S research into S2S operational predictions a new paradigm is needed for the U.S. research to operations (R2O) pipeline. At the center of the challenges within R2O for S2S is the participa tion by researchers with new ideas and tools in development and improvement of the prediction systems in the operational centers. Closing the gap between research and devel opment and operational prediction wi ll require the capability to establish workflow provenance and automate anal ysis where feasible and reasonable, for which research and development are needed. The major route for research resu lts and successes to move into operations are by diffusion through the pr ofessional literature and meetings and some focused symposia, like those of ECMWF, fo r example, Seasonal Prediction in 2012 and on Subseasonal Prediction in 2015. Continuation of these efforts is important to further the transfer of information along the R2O pipeline. The section on current activities above de scribes efforts by the U.S. Government, ECMWF, and the UK Met Office to improve the fl ow of research to operations. Promoting and expanding these mechanisms would help to include more scientists in plowing the new ground of S2S. Beyond current activities, the Committee recommends two additional approaches. One is the use of a data archive of operational determin istic and ensemble forecasts and retrospective forecasts and their initia lization data by the research commun ity outside the operational centers. This would facilitate further an alyses of sources of predictabi lity; identify new sources of predictability, skill diagnostics, and more. Data storage will be a challenge for these types of request, but not an insurmountable one. These ac tivities could focus on specific periods of time, for example, targeting a field campaign relevant to S2S or a special year of interest such as a given phase of the QBO, to help minimize the archiving effort require d by operational modeling centers. Or, national data depositorie s could be established for this and other \"big data\" projects. The WWRP / WCRP S2S proj ect and NMME described above have already begun working on making operational cente r data available to the res earch community, including both the reforecast and forecast data. Overall, th ere is a pragmatic and near-term opportunity for operational centers to help make such archived data more ava ilable\u2014through the S2S Project or otherwise\u2014for the research community to use. This could potentially be achieved via test centers. In addition, there is an opportunity for the research comm unity to take more advantage of the operational center data that is now becoming available from the S2S project. A second approach of substantial benefit w ould be to provide researchers with the capability to request re-runs of operational models or conduc t numerical experiments using operational models themselves. Some of the visiti ng scientists programs ha ve enabled researcher the ability to insert their dia gnostics into operational models, but the ability for researchers to request re-runs of operational models for specific time periods or even test their new parameterization will be difficult given the reso urce constraints of operational centers. The Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 168 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY ability for users to run operational models themse lves will be a more difficult challenge, one that involves making the modeling code itself accessible to the research community as well as access to sufficient computing power to run the code. So me modeling centers have already released the codes of their previous versions of operationa l models. But making codes of current operational models available and accessible is a difficult endeavor that requir es a significant effort on the part of the operational center s. To improve the flow of advances between research and operations, operational centers should work towa rds addressing these subs tantial challenges of meeting requests for re-runs and making model code s available for researchers over the course of the next couple of decades. Lastly, most decision makers are likely to acquire information via an intermediary. As described in Chapter 3, the Committee recommends an ongoing process that involves those that use forecast products to make decisions and thos e who produce forecasts to work iteratively to develop improved forecast products . The private sector will be a key part of that process. Transferring enhancements in private sector pr oducts or performance to improvements at the operational centers presents a si gnificant challenge, but part of the iterative process of product development could include feedback from privat e industry for identifying and improving system performance. Recommendation M: Provide mechanisms for research and operational communities to collaborate, and aid in transitioning componen ts and parameterizations from the research community into operational cen ters, by increasing research er access to operational or operational mirror systems. Specifically: Increase opportunities for S2S researchers to participate in operational centers. Enhance interactions with th e international comm unity (e.g., the S2S Project and APCC) and with the WMO Lead Centers. Provide better access in the near-term to archived data from operational systems, potentially via test centers. Develop, in the longer term, the ability for researchers to request re-runs or do runs themselves of operational model forecasts. Encourage effective partnerships with th e private sector through ongoing engagement (see also Recommendation B). Establish Capability to Respond to Unanticipated Events Large, unanticipated events that may infl uence the weather/climate system may be natural, accidental, or deliberately caused by humans. Natural events of this scale within the last couple centuries have included major volcanic eruptions (such as Pi notubo, El Chichon, and Agung in the 20th century or Krakatoa and Tambora in the 19th century), but could also include meteoroid or comet impacts. Prominent recent accidental events that raised this level of public concern about their wide-spread impact on times cales of weeks and longer have included the Deepwater Horizon Oil spill (NRC, 2013) and th e Fukushima Diachi nuclear accident\u2014for its potential to spread radioactiv ity (NRC, 2014; also see Chapte r 3). Deliberate events have Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 6: Interface Between Research and Operations 169 PREPUBLICATION COPY included the 1991 Kuwait oilfield fires, or more benignly the decision to substantially curtail Chinese industrial emissions to improve air quality during the 2008 Ol ympics. On geological timescales there is strong evidence of much larger volcanic eruptions and impacts by extra- planetary bodies. Similarly, future human-induced climate forcing events could greatly exceed the magnitude of historical events. Of particular note, the 2015 NRC report on \"Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth\" finds that la rge-scale albedo modification to cool the climate system is tec hnically feasible with a scope th at could be done unilaterally by a single nation or even a wealthy non -state actor, but that the cons equences of such actions would not be evenly distributed and could alter atmospheric circulat ion and precipitation patterns. These types of large unanticipated events have the potential to a ffect the weather/climate system (and potentially much of the Earth system depending on the event) over S2S timescales. The Committee recommends that the nation s hould develop and maintain a system for projecting the consequen ces of any unusual forcing events\u2014i n particular over S2S timescales\u2014 in order to aid emergency response and disaster planning. This system should be able to be mobilized within one week (giving time to ascertain the details of the forcing and select the appropriate set of predicted qua ntities), and return preliminary results for timescales from the near-term to seasonal and out to a one year forecast horizon by the end of a second week. Components of this system should have their qua lity established before any such event via documentation of hypothetical test cases in the peer-rev iewed literature. For longer timescales than one year, there is time to mobilize th e broader scientific community to expand the recommended on-demand prediction system and develop new capabilities tailored to the specifics of the major event in question. This syst em should be initialized using the same datasets and systems as the operational S2S prediction, and have configurations that include a full range of physical and chemical atmospheric, oceanic , cryosphere, and ecosystem processes, drawing upon capabilities from the nation's operational a nd research weather and climate forecasting systems. Other scientific discip lines should be engaged to prep are components for this system that may be appropriate for such events as vol canic eruptions, meteor im pacts, a limited nuclear war, oil or other chemical spills in large wa ter bodies, atmospheric or oceanic releases of radioactivity, or releases of biologically or radi atively active gases and aerosols. Although this system will draw upon the expertise of the natio n's research community, it will need to be considered an operational system, with the same robustness and reliability as is expected from other operational forecast systems. The developm ent of this new capability for projecting the consequences of unusual forcing events will leve rage off many existing research activities or efforts to develop longer-term Earth system proj ection capabilities, but it will still constitute a substantial new effort by the nation. As such, th e fiscal and computati onal resources to support this new capability should not be drawn from the limited resources currently dedicated to improving existing S2S forecasts. By their very nature, it is not possible to statistically validate predictions of the consequences of unusual events by examining sk ill in simulating large numbers of observed events, or to do bias corrections in the same way as is done for operati onal predictions. Instead, bias control could be done analogously to how it is handled for centennial scale climate projections: predictions of c onsequences should be taken from the difference between an ensemble of simulations in which a forcing ev ent occurs and an ensemble of identically initialized \"control runs\" in which the event doe s not occur. The credib ility of the prediction system can be evaluated by examining its abil ity to simulate well-observed smaller analogous events (e.g., reasonable simulations of the 1991 Mt . Pinotubo eruptions ar e a necessary condition Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 170 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY for credibly simulating the consequences of a hypothetical Yellowstone Caldera mega-eruption of the magnitude that occurred 640,000 years ago; this is analogous to the use of 20th century simulations to establish the credibility of coupled climate models for 21st century projections of climate change). In addition, since there can be significant nonlinearities in the Earth System, the prediction systems should be used for a diverse se ries of hypothetical forcing event scenarios of sufficiently large magnitude to ascertain that they will work sensibly when called upon. Quality assurance and a critical evaluation of skill are essential for any official forecast product. For routinely generated products, this is usually done via ma king a large number of retrospective forecasts of well-observed previous situations. For unprecedented forcing events, this may not be possible. Public ation of simulations of hypothetical or poorl y observed historical events in the peer-reviewed scientific liter ature may provide one adequate path towards providing quality assurance. Howeve r, it is important that prot ocols for quality assurance be agreed upon and these steps towards quality assu rance be taken for a wide range of potentially useful projection capabilities. This quality assura nce must occur before an unanticipated forcing event, so that these capabilities are available to provide timely and useful guidance to decision makers and the public once such an event occurs. Recommendation N: Develop a national capabil ity to forecast the consequences of unanticipated forcing events. Specifically: Improve the coordination of government agencies and academics to be able to quickly respond to unanticipated events to provide S2 S forecasts and associated responses using the unanticipated events as sources of predictability. Utilize emerging applications of Earth system models for long-range transport and dispersion processes (e.g., of aerosols). Increase research on the generation, valida tion, and verification of forecasts for the aftermath of unanticipated forcing events. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Specifically, the reports reco gnized: 1) the importance of aligning modeling research and development w ith trends in computing; and 2) creating professional incentive structures and workforce pi pelines to ensure investment in pivotal yet currently under-represented activities such as model development, moving research to operational systems, and meeting decision maker needs. Many of the barriers identified in these prev ious reports for weather forecasting and climate modeling are common to subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) predicti on. Thus realizing the full potential of Earth system forecasts on S2S timescales will require overcoming many similar challenges to weather and climate modeling. This chapter describes two core capacity-building elements required for the success of an advanced S2S forecasting capability, building on, and sometimes reiterating, findings and recommendations issued in the previously mentioned reports (NRC, 2010b, 2012a, b): Building S2S cyberinfrast ructure capacity, S2S workforce. BUILDING CAPACITY FOR S2S CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE This section reviews the risk s and opportunities posed to th e current S2S computational and data infrastructure by changes in technol ogy as well as the growi ng cyberinfrastructure requirements to support S2S forecasting. Althoug h the challenges posed by S2S prediction systems are similar to those faced by weathe r or climate modeling systems, the data and processing requirements for S2S prediction systems will likely test the current cyberinfrastructure capacity to at least as great an extent as those other systems, and an expansion of the cyberinfrastructure and human cap ital will be necessary to realize the potential of S2S forecasting. There are several factors driving the grow ing demand for cyberinfrastructure. Data assimilation, which integrates observational data with models, will be a major driver in growing computational and storage infrastructure needed to enable significant improvements in S2S forecasting. As detailed for climate models generally (NRC, 2012b), future S2S models will require increased computational capacity due to the scientific need for higher spatial and temporal resolutions (e.g., for resolving clouds , ocean eddies, and orographic processes\u2014see Chapter 5). Typical data volumes from the output of S2 S prediction models are discussed in Box 7.1.

Forecast lead times range from 32 to 60 days, spatial resolutions range from about 20 to 250 km, frequency ranges from monthly to daily, and ensemble sizes range from 4 to 51 members. A conservative estimate for what these variables would be expected to be in 10 years for a U.S.-based S2 S forecast system would be 90-day lead times, 20km spatial resolution, a doubling of the number of ver tical levels, 51 member ensemble size, and daily frequency for the forecasts. This would represent about a 300-fold increase in computational resources. This amounts to forecast data volumes on the order of more than 1 Terabyte per day including just the more typical and basic atmosphere, land, and near-su rface ocean quantities. Similar considerations can be made for the retrospective forecast requirements, which essentially represent a multi-decade, ensemble retrospective forecast calculated daily for calib ration and validation purposes, and can amount to hundreds of Terabytes per day. This will drive a greater than 1,000-times increase in data volume and transport from what is seen today by the S2S community. Finall y, the analysis phase is multi-purpose and computationally significant; it needs to produce the first-guess fields for the next prediction run, and prepare numerous products for forecasti ng, decision making, and research. All these developments are seen as essential for more accu rate, reliable, and useful S2S forecasts. Taking all these factors together in an example, improving model resolution from 100 km to 25 km and doubling the number of vertical levels as well as model comp lexity, while running on the order of 100 ensemble members, could easily result in a 1,000-fold increase in computational costs compared to today. Thus, the S2S modeling en terprise fundamentally relies on sustained, dramatic improvements in supercomputing capabili ties and needs to strategically position itself to fully exploit them. Finding 7.1: Needed advances in S2S foreca st models (higher resolutions, increased complexity, etc.), require dram atically increased computing capacities (perhaps 1,000x) and similar advances in related storage and data transport capacities. Computing Infrastructure The backdrop for this increase in computati onal requirements is a disruptive time in the broader landscape of computing systems and programming m odels. All indications are that increases in computing performance through the next decade will arrive not in the form of faster chips, but slightly slower chips with many more computational elements on them (ASCAC, 2015; NRC, 2012b). Exploiting thes e new many-core chips will no t only require refactoring existing parallelism to effectively take advantage of their architectures, but will also require finding additional parallelism throughout S2S app lications. As highlighted previously in NRC 2012a for climate modeling, there are three primar y ways to do this: 1) add parallelism by scaling the problem out\u2014increasing the horizontal resolution does this, but at the expense of shortening the model time-step; 2) exploit parallelis m that is already there but has not been used before, for example by introducing task paralleli sm by overlapping certain physics calculations or by finding shared-memory parallelism (e.g., Open Multi-Processing [OpenMP]), or finally, 3) develop new algorithms with more inherent parallelis m-an example of this is the effort to create Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 7: Cyberinfrastructure and Workforce Capacity Building 173 PREPUBLICATION COPY so-called parallel in time (PinT) algorithms (e .g. Cotter and Shipton, 2012). All three efforts will require much higher levels of collaboration betw een computer scientists, software engineers, applied mathematicians, and S2S scientists. Finding 7.2: The transition to new computing hardware and software through the next decade will not involve faster processing elements, but rather more of them with considerably more complex embodiments of concurrency; this transition will be highly disruptive. Storage Infrastructure As with computing infrastructure, the hier archy of storage devices, including cache, memory, disk, and tape, as well as the virtual me mory and file-system abstractions that overlay them, will also undergo a dramatic, transformativ e change in the coming years (NRC, 2012b). As with climate modeling, these change s will require an assessment of most data storage elements (both memory and disk) of S2S applications in order to fully leverage the storage and memory hierarchy of emerging computer architectures. The work of identifying the elements of the code that can or should be addressed is in itself a daunting task. Technologies like Solid State Devices (SSD), 3-D \"stacked\" memory, and non-volatile memory (NVM) have been, or will soon be introduced into planned compute and storage sy stems. These and other innovations will augment and blur the price points, sizes, and performance characteristics of the traditional storage hierarchy. Further out, hybrid devices like memr istors and other processor in memory (PIM) technologies will begin to blur even the dist inction between memory and computing itself. Adapting the modeling systems and managing and op timizing the utilization of this increasingly complex storage hierarchy will be fundamental to realizing the full potential of supercomputing investments. As with computing, a new breed of software engineers and modelers, and actual data scientists, will be needed to fully realize the potential of these new t echnologies. More training and workforce development will be required of new and existing software engineers, and universities will need to play a larger role in building the next generation of computational and data scientists (see section below on Buildi ng Capacity in the S2S Modeling and Prediction Workforce). Finding 7.3: Future storage technologies will be more complex and varied than today; leveraging these technological innovations will require numerous software changes and will likely be highly disruptive. S2S Application Challenges For climate models generally, increasing numbe rs of processing elements combined with deep and abstruse memory hierarchies will continue to push the limits of application code design and parallel programming standards and will make for a challenging environment for high- performance-computing (HPC) application progr ammers (NRC, 2012b). S2S applications today are already challenged in taking advantage of modern supercompu ting systems (with efficiencies typically below 5%) [Roe and Wilkie, 2015; W ilkie, 2015]. S2S applications possess several Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 174 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY special characteristics that make them particular ly challenging relative to current and even more so future HPC architectural trends: S2S applications require long simulations co mpared with traditional numerical weather prediction simulations. This in turn limits th e resolution, the inherent number of parallel degrees of freedom, and therefore their scal ability. Similar concerns accompany certain data assimilation algorithms, such as 4D variational methods, which have limited scalability relative to ense mble approaches (NRC, 2008). S2S applications are large and complex with many component models. Both the Community Earth System Model (CESM) a nd the Climate Forecast System (CFS) for example, have over 1.5 million lines of s ource code. Characteristics typical of many algorithms in S2S applications\u2014large numbers of variables (e.g., from increased model complexity) and/or irregular memory access pa tterns (e.g., unstructured grids and some advection schemes)\u2014do not work well on memory systems with deep cache hierarchies, wide cache lines, and decreasing amounts of memory per processing element. The introduction of vector capabil ities into many core processo rs creates challenges for the \"branchy\" physics codes46 typical of S2S applications. S2S phenomena are representative of chaoti c systems that are se nsitive to initial conditions (see Chapters 4 and 5). For this reas on, developers currently require bit-for-bit reproducibility (i.e., providing the same output when provided with the same input across different runs [Arteaga et al., 2014]) for tes ting and verification of model results. This restriction is a limiting factor in fully le veraging the optimization capabilities of compilers and elemental math libraries. In the future, this bit-for-bit requirement may become untenable when issues of fault resili ence, and architectures with extreme levels of concurrency and complexity further erode reproducibility (NRC, 2012b; Palmer, 2015). The possibility of irreproducible comput ation presents a fundamental challenge to the present methodology for the testing, verifi cation, and validation of S2S model results. If architectural or software infrastructure changes, or compiler optimization nudges the answers, even by a minute amount, there is no other way to prove whether the change has or has not pushed the system into a differe nt climate state other than computing the climatology of long control runs (usually 100-years-long to take into account slow climate processes). This requireme nt is restrictive and represents a considerable barrier to the development, testing, and optimization cy cle. However, given the computation power that will be utilized for dail y, multi-member, long-lead S2S forecasts, that in some cases may involve daily reforecasts as well, the computation of a 100-year climatological simulation does not seem formidable even in the development cycle. There is evolving research into the use of imprecise computing (in which irreproducibility is not elevated to the level of a requirement) to address so me of these issues (Palmer, 2015). One alternative being explored to reduce this cost is to run statistical tests on single ensemble members for consistency with the parent dist ribution over much shorter periods (Baker et al., 2015). On the other hand, having a mode wher e S2S models are able to give bit-by-bit reproducibility on computers that are able to support this is essential for the efficient development and debugging of such models . The S2S modeling community may very well need to adapt to a world where reruns of experiments are only the same in a 46 \"Branchy\" refers to physics codes that include a lot of if-then statements, thus involving significantly more computing time.

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 7: Cyberinfrastructure and Workforce Capacity Building 175 PREPUBLICATION COPY statistical sense. Similar to climate models, such ad aptation would entail profound changes in methodology and be an important re search challenge for this decade (NRC, 2012b). A possible resolution of this issue is a compromise in which exact reproducibility is available for model development and test ing but abandoned for large-scale operational computations that involve many ensemble me mbers and stochastic parameterization and forcing. Finding 7.4: S2S models are not taking full ad vantage of current computing architectures, and improving their performance will likely requir e new algorithms with better data locality, and significant refactoring of exis ting ones for more parallelism. Shared Software Infrastructure Components Similar to the climate modeling community (NRC, 2012a), a renewed and aggressive commitment to shared software infrastructure components across the S2S community could be an efficient way to navigate li kely transitions in computing a nd storage infrastructure, and to overcome poor efficiencies from current applic ations. The transition will likely be more disruptive than the transition from shared memory vector to distributed memory parallel that started in the late 1990s. Indeed, conventional wisdom in the HPC community (see Zwieflhofer [2008] and Takahara and Parks [2008]) is th at the next generation conversion will be significantly more complex and unpredictable than previous changes, given the absence of a clear technology path, progr amming model, performance analysis tools, etc. The S2S modeling community is seeing the na tural evolution of software component adoption (regridding from Earth System Mode ling Framework [ESMF] used by CESM, the National Centers for Atmospheric Research's [NCAR's] Parallel I/O [PIO] library used by others). The Committee believes that the commun ity is now at the poin t where developing an integrative modeling environment (across models and organizations) outweighs the costs of developing the tools to enable an integrativ e environment (e.g., Comm on Infrastructure for Modeling the Environment [CIME] at NCAR, Earth System M odeling Framework [ESMF] at NOAA and Navy) and the cost of moving to them. With the experience, successes, and lessons learned in the past decade, the forecasti ng community is positi oned to accelerate the development and adoption of an integrative modeling strategy. So far, not many software components have be en broadly adopted as a standard, because modeling centers that initially invested in one solution have had insufficient funding and incentives to switch to another. The vector to paralle l disruption led to widespread adoption of coupler technologies at the s cale of individual institutions. The forecast modeling community can conceive of a common integrative modeling environment that include s a set of component elements that could be subscribed to by a ll major U.S. forecast modeling groups, supports a hierarchy of models with component-wise interc hangeability, and also supports development of high-performance implementations that enable forecast models of unpre cedented resolution and complexity to be efficiently adapted to new ar chitectural platforms. The U.S. Global Change Research Program's Interagency Group on Integrative Modeling (IGIM47) has begun work to better coordinate the countr y's climate modeling efforts (USGCRP IGIM, 2015); such coordination would likely benefit S2S forecasting efforts as well.

ESPC and IGIM are exploring the potential for more commonality as their efforts go forwar d. Adopting joint standards between IGIM and ESPC will be especially important as the co mmunity moves towards seamless prediction as discussed in Box 5.2. Finding 7.5: An integrative modeling environm ent presents an appealing option for how to face some of the large uncertainty about the evolution of hardware and programming models over the next two decades. Data Storage, Transfer, and Workflow for S2S Prediction In addition to the supercomputer/storage infr astructure and the for ecasting models, a key element of the forecasting workflow includes data cyberinfrastructure, including the storage, transfer, analysis, and visualization workflow s associated with big data sets. The data cyberinfrastructure for the end-to-end forecasting workflows may ultimately be an even larger challenge than the compute challenges confront ing S2S prediction. The data elements include several elements assimilating the large quantities of operational data with model simulation data and facilitating the data analysis , visualization, and overall work flow for all these elements. Observational Data Remote sensing systems (satellites, radars, instrumented aircraft, and drones) along with conventional and automated in situ measurements in both the atmosphere and ocean will produce over one billion scalars per forecast cycle (see Chapter 5). Transport and preparation of these data for model assimilation is a challenge. Ne tworks need to have the necessary carrying capacity with minimal latency, and computing an d storage need to be available for data processing into model ready quantities (e.g., se a surface temperature in degrees Kelvin). Model Simulation Data Fundamentally this effort needs to be opera tionalized and extended to provide these vital functions. The data sharing and management infr astructure benefits from a \"network effect\" (where value grows exp onentially as more nodes are added; see, e.g., Church and Gandal, 1992; Katz and Shapiro, 1985). It involves developing operational infrastructure for petabyte-scale (and soon exabyte-scale; see Overpeck et al., 201 1) distributed data stores. The S2S project (described in Chapter 6) has begun efforts to ar chive and share data from multiple operational S2S forecasting systems, but this effort is st ill growing and is underu tilized by the research community (see Finding 6.2). 48 ftp://ftp.oar.noaa.gov/ESPC%5CNUOPC%20Dou ments%5CNUOPC%20%20CMA%20One%20Pager.pdf Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 7: Cyberinfrastructure and Workforce Capacity Building 177 PREPUBLICATION COPY Finding 7.6: Researchers do not currently have a good solution for processing and analyzing S2S data that is federated across many institut ions. A dedicated and enhanced data-intensive cyberinfrastructure will be required to enabl e the distributed S2S community to access the enormous data sets generated from both simulation and observations. Data Analysis Workflow S2S data-intensive applications and workflows are likely to face data analysis challenges of similar scale and scope to those faced by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP). The CMIPs have observed th at because storage systems\u2014as part of an integrated data- intensive computing environment\u2014have not kept up with advances in computing, they have become a bottleneck and as a result a ripe targ et for enhancements. These lessons from CMIP efforts are a bell-weather to what the S2S pred iction community could expect. In addition, the demand for data storage, analysis, and distributio n resources will grow as models move to finer resolutions, incorporate more complexity, and serve needs of an in creasingly diverse and sophisticated set of users. In response, data-cen tric workflows, like the applications themselves, need to become more parallel, and use storage infrastructure mo re efficiently. In addition, the community needs to consider reductions of data volumes that can be achieved through both lossless and lossy compression of datasets, as well as a shift away from the paradigm of store- now-analyze-later to mechanisms that allow model output to be analyzed on the fly and re-ran as needed. There is an increasing need to use, access, and manipulate large volumes of remotely stored data, and this places new demands on in frastructure and requires systematic planning and investment at the national level. Finding 7.7: New approaches to data-centric workfl ow software that incorporate parallelism, remote analysis, and data compression will be re quired to keep up with the demands of the S2S forecasting community. Moving Forward with Building Capa city for S2S Cyberinfrastructure As has been discussed in this section, adva nces in S2S forecast models will require dramatically increased computing capacities, bu t the transition to new computing hardware and software through the next decade will be highly disruptive with the increasing concurrency of new HPC systems. In addition, future storage tec hnologies will be more complex and varied than today. S2S models are not taking full advantag e of current computing architectures, and improving their performance to leverage th e coming technology innovations will require numerous software changes and will likely be highly disruptive. At this time, the many emerging architectures do not adhere to a common programming model. While new ways to expres s parallelism may well hold the ke y to progress, from the point of view of the software developers of large a nd complex scientific applications, the transition path is not clear (NRC, 2012b). Assessments unde rtaken by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) (e.g., DOE, 2008; Kogge et al., 2008) indicate profound uncertainty about how one might program a future system that may Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 178 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY encompass many-core chips, coprocessors a nd accelerators, and unprecedented core counts requiring the management of tens of millions of concurrent threads on such hardware. The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCA ST) has called for the nation to \"undertake a substantial and sustained pr ogram of fundamental research on hardware, architectures, algorithms and software with the potential for enabling game-changing advances in high-performance computing\" (PCAST, 2010). This challenge will grow to a billion threads by the end of this decade. The prevalent programmi ng model for parallel systems today is based on MPI (Lusk and Yelick, 2007), shared-memory direc tives (e.g., OpenMP [Chandra et al., 2001]), or a hybrid of both. The adaptation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI)/OpenMP paradigm to exascale architectures is an ar ea of active research investigation. The weather and climate forecasting community has never retreated from experimenting with leading-edge systems and programming ap proaches to achieve required levels of performance. The current high-performance comp uting (HPC) architectural landscape, however, is particularly challenging because it is not clea r what direction future hardware and software paradigms may follow. The collaborative natu re of system co-design involves end- user/developer community and private s ector involvement (e.g., the Coral system49). It is clear that more resources are needed to make the progress necessary to prepare S2S applications for next generation supercomputers. In light of these challenges, the Committee recommends a national plan and investment stra tegy be developed to take better advantage of current hardware and software and to meet the ch allenges in the evolution of new hardware and software for all components of the prediction process. Recommendation O: Develop a national plan and investment strategy for S2S prediction to take better advantage of current hardware and software and to meet the challenges in the evolution of new hardware and software for all stages of the prediction process, including data assimilation, operation of high-resolution co upled Earth system m odels, and storage and management of results. Specifically: Redesign and recode S2S models and data assimilation systems so they will be capable of exploiting current and future massively parall el computational capabilities; this will require a significant and long-te rm investment in computer scientists, software engineers, applied mathematicians, and statistics researchers in partnership with the S2S researchers.

Continue to develop dynamic model cores th at take the advantage of new computer technology. BUILDING CAPACITY IN THE S2S MODE LING AND PREDICTION WORKFORCE The current workforce of S2S model developers is insufficient to meet the growing need for S2S model development work (Jakob, 2010). Most modeling centers have only a small number of people directly involve d in model development. It is difficult to quantify the number of S2S model developers in the United States , because a systematic study on the modeling workforce has never been done. Many of the chal lenges faced in maintaining a robust S2S model development workforce are similar to those faced in climate model development. As such, much of the work in this section draws heavily on previous work on climate modeling (NRC, 2012b). Current Challenges in the S2S Model Development Workforce The development and use of comprehensive S2 S models in the United States requires a large number of talented individual s in a diverse set of discipline s. The critical point is that development of atmospheric and environmental prediction models, for S2S and other ranges, needs to become an interdisciplinary effort invol ving scientists, software engineers, and applied mathematicians (NRC, 2008). As described for clim ate models, these areas of expertise include (NRC, 2012b): scientists engaged in unde rstanding the S2S predicti on system, leading to the development of new parameterizations and ot her model improvements (distinct cadres of scientists are often needed for various model components, such as the ocean or terrestrial ecosystem models); scientists engaged in usi ng the models for well-designed numerical experiments and conducting extensive diagnostics of the mode ls to better understand their behavior, ultimately leading both to model products a nd to scientific insights that provide the impetus and context for model improvements; scientists studying the regional details provided by the ar chived results from global model simulations and related downscaling efforts, and how these vary across various models; support scientists and programmers to conduct ex tensive sets of nume rical simulations in support of various scientific programs and to ensure their scientific integrity; software engineers, applied mathematicians and scientists that straddle these areas to explore fundamental new algorithms and a pproaches that can fully utilize new generations of computing and storage architectures; software engineers to creat e efficient, paralle lizable and portable underlying codes, including the development and use of common software components; data scientists to understand and manage comp lex workflows and to facilitate easy and open access to model output th rough modern technologies; Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

From the limited data available (NRC, 2012b) , it appears that the level of human resources available for S2S modeling has not kept pace with the demands for increasing realism and comprehensiveness of the models. Data on the numbers of students involved in S2S model development do not exist, and any proxy data an d anecdotal evidence (NRC, 2012b) suggest that the pipeline for S2S model developers is not growing in a robust fashion. These considerations suggest that the deve lopment of S2S and other predictive models needs to increasingly be a community endea vor involving the operati onal centers and the academic community. And to be effective, there must be mechanisms to encourage interchange of personnel and talent, either as long-term collabo rators or as shorter-ter m visitors. For example, students might well perform their dissertation research in an operational center under the collaborative supervision of center scientists and faculty members in their academic institution. In addition to not having sufficient human resources, many of the skills needed by the S2S workforce are yet to be developed (e .g., new algorithms, tight coupling between the understanding of the science and the software requirements), which places an even greater imperative on maintaining a robust pipeline of early-career scientis ts who are involved in model development. This will become more critical with the next generation of supercomputers (see section above on Building Capacity for S2S Cyberinfrastructure), and serious efforts will be needed to bridge the gap between scientists and the software engi neering and numerical algorithms skills needed to utilize this new hardware. These gaps in the necessary workforce skills need significant attention and could be significant impediments to progress in S2S forecasting. Finding 7.8: From the limited data available, it seems that the cadre of S2S modelers being trained is not growing robustly in the United St ates and is not keeping pace with the needs of this rapidly evolving field. Current Challenges in the S2S Applications Workforce There are some programs that train students to work at the interface of climate science and society (e.g., Columbia University's Ma ster's program in Climate and Society 50), which could be a valuable resource to the S2S ente rprise. However, as demands for S2S products continue to grow, there is also li kely to be a shortage of interd isciplinary researchers needed to improve connectivity between S2S forecasts and us e. This includes interdisciplinary researchers in boundary organizations and ot her interdisciplinar y research centers, product development specialists in the private sector, and agency ope rations personnel with tr aining or expertise in S2S predictability. This also includes social a nd behavioral researchers capable of examining decision processes to identify barriers to use and improve the flow of information between physical scientists and users. The challenges of connecting information pr oduction to use are discussed in Chapter 3. Here, the focus is on the skills needed to enable those connections. The potential scale of use 50 http://climatesociety.ei.columbia.edu/, accessed January 27, 2016. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Weather and climate info rmation is not well integrated into traditional academic disciplines that produce many of the agency pe rsonnel who may use S2S information, such as staff at water management agencies or large ag ricultural businesses. In addition, relatively few academic institutions offer interdisciplinary degrees that include physical, social, and behavioral sciences focused on issues rela ted to weather or climate. Finding 7.9: Interdisciplinary academic programs and centers lack the capacity to meet growing needs for research and applications necessary to maximize the use of S2S information. Few academic programs include weat her or climate as a component of training the future workforce. Building a More Robust S2S Workforce S2S model development is a challenging j ob. It involves synthesizing deep and broad knowledge, working across the inte rface between science and computing, and working well in a team. Thus it is important to attempt to hire, trai n, and retain the most talented, available people in this field. There are often insufficient ince ntives to compel promising young people to work on S2S model development; this applies to bot h early-career computer programmers who may have other more lucrative career opportunities, and to early-career scientists who may choose to work with S2S model output to examine scientific questions or other strate gies that allow them to publish more journal articles, rather than work on model development. A suggested method for combatting this bias would be an enhanced recognition and reward system for S2S model computer code writing and for the production of modeling data sets, incl uding the recognition of such effort through stronger requirements for citation and co-authorshi p, both within modeling institutions and by academic users and collaborators ; this is a non-trivial challenge as discussed in a previous report (NRC, 2012b). S2S modeli ng groups could also compete by marketing relatively stable career tracks a nd the opportunity for stimulating cr oss-disciplinary interactions with a variety of scientists. Modeling centers outside of the United States, such as the European Centre for Medium- Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), have attempte d to attract and retain more people in S2S model development work by appointing model devel opers to 5-year terms, which is longer than typical research grant cy cles in the United States (3 years) . ECMWF offers strong incentives to bring top scientists to model development, such as access to excellent facilities, excellent tools (e.g., what some regard as the most advanced nu merical weather predicti on model in the world), and high, tax-free salaries. Further, the inclusion of highly reputed scien tists within the limited staff (150 staff members and 80 consultants) encourages a stimulating environment where delivering end-use forecasting products and doing cu tting-edge scientific re search are valued and are directly coupled. Beyond the specific model developer needs of th e S2S enterprise, ther e is an additional need for people who work at the component inte rfaces. As examined in this report, many of the challenges in the S2S realm arise from the li nkages of the model components. Therefore the overall S2S forecasting endeavor w ould benefit from paying particul ar attention to recruiting and Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 182 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY rewarding scientists who can work across specifi c disciplines of earth science to improve our ability to forecast the behavior of the Earth system as a whole. Attention to workforce development is also n eeded to help ensure that forecasts are as useful as possible to decision makers. Chapter 3 discussed that, as with weather forecasts and climate projections, most decision makers are likely to acquire S2S information via an intermediary. There are a number of existing avenue s for decision makers to interact with experts working on S2S forecasting, through so-cal led \"boundary organizations\" and other interdisciplinary entities. Boundary organizations exist within the public sector (for example NOAA's Regional Integrated Sciences and A ssessments program actively engages decision makers through tailored products, educational programs, and efforts to co-produce climate products and services), within academia (for example, Colomb ia University's International Research Institute for Climate and Society), and within the private sector. Looking forward, continued growth of both the priv ate sector and the array of produc ts and services in the public sector are required to meet th e growing demand for services on S2S timescales. In light of similar trends related to information on clim ate timescales, a recent NRC report (NRC, 2012b) recommended the formation of training program s for climate model interpreters\u2014people who are trained in both physical and social sciences related to climate, w eather and decision making, and who can facilitate two-way co-production of knowledge. There is a similar need at S2S timescales for such training programs. A possible concrete step forward would be a series of workshops to explore how to feature S2S in more undergraduate and graduate curriculums, how to identify and connect with organizations that can help this (e.g., the Natio nal Science Teachers Association), and how to interact with the private sector to help understand what skills are needed. Other entities such as the American Meteorological Society (AMS) or NSF may play a role with some of this coordination. Forecasting work at all of these timescales \u2014weather, S2S, and climate\u2014involves the prediction of outcomes which people use to make important decisions, and is therefore judged in very public ways. Predicted outcomes are validated (or not) on a continuous basis. The fact that S2S connects very strongly to managing enviro nmental risks could be drawn upon more heavily to entrain talented and mission-d riven young people into the field. In looking across the numerous challenges facing the S2S workforce, the Committee recommends that the Nation pur sue a collection of actions to examine the S2S workforce, remove barriers that exist across the entire wo rkforce pipeline, and develop mechanisms to improve and sustain the workforce. Recommendation P: Pursue a collection of ac tions to address workforce development that removes barriers that exist across the entire wo rkforce pipeline and in the diversity of scientists and engineers involved in advan cing S2S forecasting and the component and coupled systems. Specifically: Gather quantitative information about work force requirements and expertise base to support S2S modeling in order to more fu lly develop such a training program and workforce pipeline.

This chapter draw s from the text, findings, and recommendations presented in previous chapters to develop a vision to serve as an inspirational yet possible target for a desired future state of subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) prediction in the next 10 years, and a set of research strategies to guide actions that are necessary to move to wards that vision. All of the recommendations from previous chapters are organized within these st rategies and together serve as the Committee's comprehensive resear ch agenda for S2S forecasting over the next decade. Implementing the research agenda for improving S2S predictions will require collaboration between researcher s and users to develop more useful forecast products, basic research to advance understanding of the processes governing predic tability in the Earth system, exploiting these new discoveries in models, and melding existing with new modeling and computing capabilities. Thus the S2S research ag enda should simultaneously foster work in areas that are nearing maturity with more ambitious objec tives that may take a decade or more to fully realize. VISION FOR THE NEXT DECADE For the past several decades, weather forecasts on the scale of a few days have yielded invaluable information to improve decision maki ng across all sectors of society. Determining the total economic value of this forecasting informati on is an area of active research (Letson et al., 2007; Morss et al., 2008), but previo us research indicates that a si gnificant portion of annual U.S. gross domestic product (tens of billio ns or even trillions of dollars) is sensitive to fluctuations in weather (Dutton, 2002; Lazo et al., 2011; U.S. Department of Commerce, 2014). Certainly short- term forecasts play a vital role in helping society manage this economic exposure and the associated social risk. However, many critical d ecisions must be made several weeks to months in advance of potentially favorable or disruptiv e environmental conditions. As demonstrated by case studies and other information presented in Ch apter 3, S2S forecasts have great potential to inform such decisions across a wide variety of se ctors. For example, it ca n take weeks or months to move emergency and disaster-r elief supplies. Pre-staging resour ces to areas that are likely to experience extreme weather or an infectious di sease outbreak could save lives and stretch the efficacy of limited resources. Similarly, emergenc y managers responding to unanticipated events such as nuclear power plant accidents or large o il spills are faced with th e task of communicating the ramifications of such events on timescales that stretch well beyond a few days. There are many more such examples: naval and commercial shipping planners desi gnate shipping routes weeks in advance, seeking to stage assets strate gically, avoid hazards, and/or take advantage of favorable conditions; with improved knowledge of the likelihood of pr ecipitation or drought, farmers can purchase seed varieties that are most likely to increase yields and reduce costs; and Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 186 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY depending on the year, water resource managers can face a multitude of decisions about reservoir levels in the weeks, months, and seasons ahead of eventual water consumption (Table 3.1 lists additional examples). S2S forecasts are already proving to be of valu e in making such decisions in sectors such as agriculture, energy, water resources manageme nt, and public health. However, there are many sectors that have yet to exploit even the S2S information that is currently available. The Committee believes that the benefits of S2S forecasts to society will only increase as the quality of S2S forecasts improves, as more variables ar e represented in forecast products, and as social and computer science research and boundary inst itutions accelerate awar eness of, access to, and use of S2S information. This potential of S2S for ecasts to benefit society is only likely to grow due to the increased exposure to risk and increas ed severity and frequency of hazards expected with climate change and continued globalization. Working iteratively with water resources professionals, emergency managers, military planners, and a myriad of othe r potential users to co-design new S2S forecast products and related decision-making tools has th e potential to further expand us e and enable stakeholders to derive much more value from S2S forecasts. Along with an enhanced focus on developing predictions of extreme and other disruptive events, such iterative engagement with forecast users has the potential to foster a stronger culture of pl anning across S2S and longer timescales, including adaptation and resilien ce to climate change. This coul d provide social and economic benefits that amplify and transcend the dire ct benefits of S2S forecasts themselves. This evidence influenced the Committee's fi nding that more skillful and useful S2S forecasts\u2014developed through sustained engagement with users and advances in basic knowledge and technological capabilities\u2014c ould radically improve the ba sis for decision making on S2S timescales. There are also emerging science and t echnical capabilities that make rapid advances in S2S forecasts more likely than envisioned ev en 5 years ago. Advances both in technology\u2014 satellites, computing, etc.\u2014a nd in science\u2014model parameterizations, data assimilation techniques, etc.\u2014are now on the horizon that make advances in S2S forecasting more feasible. Further, the Committee's recommen dations are targeted at areas where efforts are most needed and therefore investments are most likely to lead to advances. Such advances now have the potential to increa se the flow of benefits from S2S forecasts so that, in the Committee's view, they have hi gh potential to outweigh the costs and effort associated with improving S2S forecasts. Thus the Committee developed a vision to serve as a target for S2S predictions over the next decade: S2S forecasts will be as widely used a decade from now as weather forecasts are today . This is admittedly a bold vision because overcoming the challenges to developing S2S forecasting will ta ke sustained effort and investment. However, the Committee believes that realizing this visi on is now possible within the next decade. Achieving the Committee's vision in this report is not incompatible with other visions for Earth system prediction systems (such as for th e creation of a Virtual Earth System (VES)\u2014see Box 8.1), but it has the potential to become r eality within a much shorter timeframe. The Committee's strategies and research agenda, which are presented ne xt in this chapter, provide describe priority actions for moving towards this desired future state.

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 8: Vision and Way Forward for S2S Earth System Prediction 187 PREPUBLICATION COPY Box 8.1\u2014Long-Term Visions In 2008, the NRC Committee on The Potential Impact of High-End Capability Computing on Illustrative Fields of Science a nd Engineering foresaw a Virtual Earth System (VES) that would maintain \"a continuous and dyna mically consistent portr ait of the atmosphere, oceans, and land...a digital mirror reflecting events all over the planet.\" The VES would operate in the cloud on linked petascale machines, assim ilating data from tens of satellites and myriad other observations. (NRC, 2008). The VES would ser ve as the foundation for a companion Future Earth System that would offer a probabilistic por trait of events and Earth states expected over ranges of leads much wider than those availa ble today (e.g., Dutton, 2010). Indeed in the conclusion to the 2008 report, the NRC stated: \"The new dynamic record of Earth and the predictions of the VES model would bring forth an era of enlightened management of weather and climate risk, contributing to national economic vitality and stimulati ng a strong commitment to environmental stewardship. The creation and operation of an accurate and reliable VES would be a stunning and commanding national achievement \u2014a dramatic demonstration of the benefits that can be realized for society by linking Earth and atmospheric science with the most advanced computers.\" The VES described in the 2008 NRC report th us presented a visionary consideration of the future of environmental forecasting and its impacts on decision making. However, it also identified the incredible demands and resources that would be required to develop and maintain such a system. Along with the 2010 NRC Report on Intraseasonal to Interannaual climate and weather prediction (NRC, 2010b), this report presen ts a vision and research agenda that takes society a step towards grand visions for envi ronmental prediction systems such as a VES\u2014 specifically by targeting the development of Ea rth system predictions on S2S lead times, where there is good potential for gains to be made in the coming years (NRC, 2010a, the present report). These advances include improved accuracies, exte nded lead times, and prediction of other components of the environment beyond the traditional weather variables . S2S RESEARCH STRATEGIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS Maximizing benefits of S2S forecasts while minimizing the associated costs will be important for rapidly improving S2S forecasting. Th e Committee drew on findings in Chapters 3 through 7 to develop four overarching research st rategies to help priori tize activities in S2S forecasting and to organize activities so that they most directly support the vision to substantially expand the use of S2S forecast information in the next decade: 1. Engage Users in the Process of Developing S2S Forecast Products 2. Increase S2S Forecast Skill 3. Improve Prediction of Extreme and Disruptive Events and Consequences of Unanticipated Forcing Events 4. Include More Components of the Eart h System in S2S Forecast Models Fourteen associated recommendations deri ved from Chapters 3 through 6 describe research and aligned activities in the physical and social sciences that the Committee has determined to have the greatest po tential for advancing in each of the four strategic directions. In addition, the Committee proposes a set of supporti ng recommendations, derived from findings in Chapter 7, related to cyberinfrastructure and wo rkforce.

Ten years hence, the Committee envisions an S2S prediction system that is much more interactive with decision makers from a wide array of sector s. In order to achieve th is level of interaction, the user community must be brought into the re search and development process sooner rather than later. In fact, a key finding of the Comm ittee is that the S2S research and operational prediction community would benefit from engagi ng in an iterative dialogue with the user community, beginning as soon as possible. Such a process can help further prioritize the development of specific forecast variables and metrics, and ensure that data and resource- intensive retrospective forecasts, as well as th e operational forecasts themselves, retain and exploit parameters that are most critical to user decision making. In order to maximize benefits of investme nts into improving S2S forecasts over time, there should be an ongoing effort to co-design forecast products on S2S timescales that match what is scientifically feasible with what user s can make actionable. In many cases, this might involve a relatively straightforward extension of existing applications that have skill at shorter timescales and for which sophisticated users alrea dy exist. In other cases, there may be novel, actionable prediction products that can be identif ied through more extensiv e discussions between potential users and the developers of prediction systems and forecast products. Such discussions will be required to identify what operational S2S forecasts will look like, including how the skill of such forecasts will be verified. Public and academic-sector boundary institutions, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrati on (NOAA) Regional Integr ated Sciences and Assessments Program (RISA) programs, the Inte rnational Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) at Columbia University, and several private sector companies, have already started these discussions. Leveraging the entire weather and climate enterprise will be necessary for further developing effective S2S products and services that maximize benefit to society. Recommendations Research into the use of S2S forecasts thus fa r indicates that users desire finer temporal and spatial resolutions, more actionable forecast variables (e.g., extreme, disruptive and other important events as well as mean conditions ), as well as a better understanding of how probabilistic S2S forecast information at varying leve ls of skill can be inte grated directly into decision making. However, user needs, how these match with current forecast capabilities, and barriers to use of forecasts, have not been thorou ghly investigated across sectors. An important first step in providing more actionable S2S for ecast information is to develop a body of social and behavioral science research that leads to a more comprehe nsive understanding of the current use and barriers to use of S2S predictions. This includes a better understanding of specific aspects of products\u2014forecast variab les, spatial and temporal reso lutions, necessary levels of skill, formats, etc.\u2014that would make S2S predicti ons more useful to different communities. This research is necessary in order to develop a hi gh-level view of how S2S forecast systems and outputs might be designed to meet the basic need s of the broadest number of potential users. While all weather and climate forecasts are i nherently probabilistic, this probabilistic nature gets more difficult to disregard for forecas ts at S2S and longer timescales than at shorter Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 190 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY lead times. Probabilistic predicti ons in particular represent a significant hurdle for some forecast users, as there often are substa ntial differences between the la rge-scale probabilistic forecasts that are possible at S2S timescales and the sp ecific information that decision makers might currently find actionable. Research on the use of probabilistic forecast information is thus also necessary. Recommendation A: Develop a body of social science research that leads to more comprehensive understanding of the use and ba rriers to use of seasonal and subseasonal Earth system predictions. Specifically: Characterize current and poten tial users of S2S forecasts and their decision making contexts, and identify key commonalities and differences in needs (e.g., variables, temporal and spatial scale, lead times, and forecast skill) across multiple sectors. Promote social and behavioral science rese arch on the use of probabilistic forecast information. Create opportunities to share knowledge and practices among researchers working to improve the use of predictions across weat her, subseasonal, and seasonal timescales. Beyond the research recommended above, e ngaging the S2S research and operational prediction communities in an iterative dialogue with users is necessary to help ensure that forecasts systems, forecast products, other model output, and other decision making tools maximize their benefit to society. This includ es effective probabilistic forecasts products, verification metrics, and comm unication strategies. Ongoing effo rts will be needed to match what is scientifically predictabl e and technologically f easible at S2S timescales with what users can make actionable, as scientific skill, user needs, and user perspectives continually evolve. Such iterative efforts can also help stake holders develop and imp lement decision making strategies, such as 'ready-set-go' scenarios, that utilize S2S for ecasts together with shorter and longer-lead information. These scenarios help or ganizations utilize a suite of forecasts with different lead times, promoting advance prepar ation for potential hazards even while forecast uncertainty is relatively high, and then adjusti ng actions as forecast lead times shorten and forecast uncertainty decreases. As menti oned above, private industry and 'boundary organizations' within academia and the public sector (NOAA's RISA program, the IRI at Columbia University, and many othe rs) have already started such discussions. Efforts to further engage users in the iterative pro cess of making S2S forecasts more actionable and used more in decision making should build on the experience of this boundary workforce (see also section on Supporting the S2S Forecasting Enterprise below). Recommendation B: Establish an ongoing and iter ative process in which stakeholders, social and behavioral scientists, and ph ysical scientists co-design S2S forecast products, verification metrics, and decision making tools. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 8: Vision and Way Forward for S2S Earth System Prediction 191 PREPUBLICATION COPY Specifically: Engage users with physical, social, and behavi oral scientists to de velop requirements for new products as advances are made in m odeling technology and forecast skill, including forecasts for additional environmental variables. In direct collaboration with users, devel op ready-set-go scenarios that incorporate S2S predictions and weather forecasts to enable advance preparation for potential hazards as timelines shorten and uncertainty decreases. Support boundary organizations and private se ctor enterprises that act as interfaces between forecast producers and users. Research Strategy 2: Increase S2S Forecast Skill Operational weather and ocean forecasts have steadily increased in accuracy and lead time over the past few decades. However, there is still significant room for improving the skill of many S2S forecasts. An important prerequisite for achieving the vision of widely used S2S forecasts is to significantly improve the skill of forecasts so that users' confidence in such predictions increases, and so that S2S forecasts can be applied to a range of decisions that requires higher forecast skill in order to act. Analogous to routine weather forecasting, there should be an emphasis on skillful, routine forecas ts of Earth system components 2 weeks to 12 months in advance. Prediction at these timescales will necessarily be more probabilistic and less precise as to timing and spatial location than shor ter-term weather forecasts, but there is strong evidence for predictability for many Earth system variables on S2S timescales. As discussed in Chapter 4, important sources of predictability on S2S timescales originate from: 1) modes of variability from slowly va rying processes in the ocean on the land surface (e.g., soil moisture, surface wate r, snow-pack, ocean heat content, ocean currents, eddy positions, and sea ice conditions), and 3) elements of external forcing (e.g., aerosols, greenhouse gasses). Exploiting these sources of predictability to increase forecast skill will require developing better physical understanding of sour ces of S2S predictability, as well as improving all aspects of S2S forecast systems. This includes sustaining and improving the network of observations used to study predictability and to initialize models, developing improved techniques for data assimilation and uncertainty quant ification in coupled Earth syst em models, and importantly, the reduction of Earth system model errors through a combination of increases in model resolution and the development of better model parameterizati ons to represent subgrid processes. Research to spur the development of new methods for probabilistic forecasting and probabilistic skill verification and calibrati on are also necessary. With many possible avenues available for impr oving the skill of S2S forecasts, efforts to optimize the design of S2S forecast systems are also essential. S2S forecast systems can be configured in a wide variety of ways, a nd there are numerous possible selections and combinations of the design elements (\"trade space\") in any forecast system. For example, what is the cost-benefit to the skill of S2S forecasts of adding more dynamical representation of different Earth system components and increasing the comp lexity of their coupl ing, versus increasing model resolution, extending retr ospective forecast length or averaging period, increasing Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 192 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY ensemble runs, and/or increasing the number of models in a multi model ensemble system? While all may improve forecast skill, finite computing and human resources implies trade-offs in the design and implementation of any system. T hus a key part of improving and maximizing the cost-benefit relationship for produc ing probabilistic information 2 weeks to 12 months into the future will be to undertake a systematic explorati on of the optimal use of available resources to support the development of more sk illful forecast systems. The de velopment of a cost effective and skillful operational multi-model ensemble forecast system is important, will require particular care and attention, and will involve the use of curre nt operational models along with support for the research community to actively en gage in the development and validation of new or updated members of these ensemble system s (see discussion below). Similar methods for probabilistic skill verification and calibration also need to be employed and developed for the evaluation of the forecasts of probabilities. Su ch probabilistic skill metrics would characterize, and ultimately improve, the capability of forecasti ng common but also rare S2S events (Research Strategy 3). Recommendations Making S2S predictions relies on the identification and unders tanding of sources of Earth system predictability in the S2S time range . The 2010 NRC report (NRC, 2010b) identified a number of sources of predictabi lity, including inertia in various slow-varying components of the Earth system, modes of variability in the c oupled ocean-atmospheric sy stem (e.g., ENSO, MJO), and external forcing (from either human or natural sources). Chap ter 4 further explores current understanding of these sources of S2S predictability, and emphasi zes that much remains to be learned about these sources, especially their in teractions and teleconnections. Research to advance understanding of sources and limits of predictability for specific Earth system phenomena will be critical to improving the fideli ty of S2S Earth system models, as well as to improving the ability to forecast extreme or ot her disruptive events w ith longer lead times (Research Strategy 3). Recommendation C: Identify and characterize sources of S2S predictability, including natural modes of variability (e.g., EN SO, MJO, QBO), slowly varying processes (e.g., sea ice, soil moisture, and ocean eddies), and external fo rcing (e.g., aerosol emis sions), and correctly represent these sources of predictability, includin g their interactions, in S2S forecast systems. Specifically: Use long-record and process-level observat ions and a hierarchy of models (theory, idealized models, high-resolution models, glob al earth system models, etc.) to explore and characterize the physical nature of sources of predictability and their interdependencies and dependencies on th e background environment and external forcing. Conduct comparable predictability and skill estimation studies and assess the relative importance of different sources of predictabi lity and their interac tions, using long-term observations and multi-model approaches (such as the World Meteorological Organization-lead S2S Project's databa se of retrospective forecast data). Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 8: Vision and Way Forward for S2S Earth System Prediction 193 PREPUBLICATION COPY Chapter 5 emphasizes the importance of im proving routine observations, developing more sophisticated data assimilation and un certainty quantificati on techniques, reducing individual model errors through increased re solution and better parameterizations, and developing advanced calibration techniques and m odel combinations in order to develop more skillful S2S forecast systems. Routine observations are essential for initializing models to more accurately reflect the state of the Earth system and for validating model output; they can also contribute to improved understand ing of the physical system a nd its predictability on S2S timescales (Chapter 4). Current observing networ ks for the atmosphere are more capable and robust than those for the other components of th e Earth system. However, sustaining atmospheric observations is critical for S2S as well as weat her forecasting; research to increase the use of currently available atmospheric ob servations, such as assimilation of satellite ra diances in cloudy and precipitating areas, could unlock a wealth of new information related to representing convection and precipitation in models. Relative to the atmosphere, the ocean, land surface, and cryosphere remain significantly under-observed, despite being major sources of S2S predictability. For the oceans, more routine and targeted observations are essential for S2 S applications. In part icular, sustaining and enhancing the capability to provide remotely sensed sea surface height (SSH), sea surface temperature (SST), and near-surface winds is cr itical, as is expanding the use of measurement arrays such as Argo floats and moored buoys to better measure key ocean properties below the surface (temperature, salinity a nd current velocity). In addition to improving classic observing capabilities for the ocean, smar t utilization of novel autonomous platforms could have an important impact. Reliable and accurate year-round sea ice thickness measurements are the greatest need for improving the understanding and modeling of sea ice and its influence on the coupled system. Current (CryoSat2) and planned (ICESat2) satellite missions will help to meet this key objective. Because these satellites measure fr eeboard (the height of sea ice and snow above the sea level), accurate and simultaneous measurements of snow depths are also needed to solve for sea ice thickness. The procedure for solving for sea ice thickness needs to be efficient enough to be ready in about a day, so such measurements can contribute to initializa tion of S2S forecasts. Land observations are critical for modeli ng large-scale land surface-atmosphere feedbacks and for predictions of the terrestrial water cycle. Several new satellite missions (Soil Moisture Active Passive [S MAP] and Surface Water and Ocean Topography [SWOT]) are focused on observing near-surface soil moisture a nd other aspects of surface hydrology that will be useful for improving S2S predictions. However, a number of critical gaps remain. Lack of adequate precipitation measurements currently hinder S2S prediction, and measurements of soil moisture in the root zone, as well as measuremen ts of evapotranspiration, are needed globally to better constrain hydrology and su rface fluxes. Measurements of snow depth or snow water equivalent (SWE) are also critical. SWE can be estimated from existing satellite platforms, however retrieval algorit hms must be improved in order to take full advantage of these observations. Because of gaps in the satellite observing network, in si tu measurements of variables such as precipitation, snow depth a nd land-surface atmosphere fluxes are likely to remain important and should be expanded to improve their spatial coverage. In summary, observations of the atmosphere , ocean, land surface, and cryosphere play a critical role in building, calibra ting, initializing, and evaluating th e coupled Earth system models that are used to generate S2S forecasts.

Improved observations are also critical for improving the ability to forecast important and/or extreme events (Research St rategy 3). Including observations of phenomena that remain insufficiently observed, such as the prope rties of oceans or sea ic e, can also facilitate the inclusion of more and more complex compon ents of the Earth system in S2S prediction systems (Research Strategy 4). Recommendation E: Maintain con tinuity of critical observati ons, and expand the temporal and spatial coverage of in situ and remotely sensed observations for Earth system variables that are beneficial for operational S2S pred iction and for discovering and modeling new sources of S2S predictability. Specifically: Maintain continuous satellite measurement r ecords of vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature and humidity without gaps in the data collection and with increasing vertical resolution and accuracy. Optimize and advance observations of clouds , precipitation, wind profiles, and mesoscale storm and boundary layer structure and evol ution. In particular, higher-resolution observations of these quantities are ne eded for developing and advancing cloud- permitting components of future S2S forecast systems. Maintain and advance satellite and other obs ervational capabilities (e.g., radars, drifters, and gliders) to provide continuity and bette r spatial coverage, reso lution, and quality of key surface ocean observations (SSH, SST, and winds), particularly near the coasts, where predictions of oceanic conditions are of the greatest societal importance in their own right. Maintain and expand the network of in s itu instruments providi ng routine real-time measurements of sub-surface ocean properties, such as temperature, salinity, and currents, with increasing resolutions and accuracy. Appropriate platforms for these instruments will include arrays of moored buoys (especially in the tropics), AUVs, marine mammals, and profiling floats. Develop accurate and timely year-round sea i ce thickness measurements; if from remote sensing of sea ice freeboard, simultaneous snow depth measurements are needed to translate the observation of free board into sea ice thickness. Expand in situ measurements of precipitation, snow depth, soil moisture, and land- surface fluxes, and improve and/or better expl oit remotely sensed soil moisture, snow water equivalent, and evapot ranspiration measurements. Continue to invest in observa tions (both in situ and remote ly sensed) that are important for informing fluxes between the component interfaces, including but not limited to land surface observations of temperature, mois ture, and snow depth; marine surface observations from tropical moored buoys; and ocean observations of near-surface currents, temperature, salinity, ocean heat content, mixed-layer depth, and sea ice conditions.

As the scope of S2S models evolves to incl ude and resolve more physical processes and components of the Earth system, there will be an increasing need for observations of new variables (Research Strategy 4). Fu rthermore, and as detailed above, current routine observations may not have sufficient resolution or coverage for S2S applications. Although it would be beneficial to expand the geogra phic coverage and reso lution of many types of observations, cost and logistics will continue to demand that priorities are determined, and it is not always clear a-priori what measurements will be most benefi cial to support S2S prediction systems. Thus careful study of the improvements anticipated in S2S forecasting systems will be needed to quantify the cost-benefit ratio fo r various types of additional ob servations. Such study requires integrating ocean, land, atmosphere and sea ice modeling in the planning of observing networks. Observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs ) and other sensitivity studies are powerful tools for exploring the importance of specific obse rvations on state estimation and overall model performance, and could be better used to pr ioritize improvements to observation networks (as well as model parameterizations) for S2S prediction systems. Recommendation F: Determine priorities fo r observational systems and networks by developing and implementing OSSEs, OSEs, and ot her sensitivity studies using S2S forecast systems. There are many challenges associated with integrating tens of millions of observations into the different components of an Earth syst em model, including ensuri ng that initializations are dynamically consistent and minimize the growth of errors. Given that coupling between the multiple, dynamic components of the Earth system (e.g., atmosphere, ocean, ice, land) is central to the S2S prediction problem, developing and imp lementing coupled data assimilation methods is at the forefront of S2S model development. The implementation of \"weakly coupled\" assimilation, in which an independently coupled Earth system model is integrated forwar d in time as part of the assimilation process, represents an important and ongoing step in im proving both weather and S2S forecast systems. \"Strongly coupled\" data assimilati on, in which observations with in one media are allowed to impact the state estimate in other components (with constraints), may allow for another important leap forward, especially for S2S system s in which the representation of the interaction between Earth system components is essential fo r capturing inherent predictability. However, research into the use of strongly coupled data assi milation algorithms is in its infancy, has not yet been tested on complex S2S coupled prediction m odels, and presently faces several barriers to implementation. Fundamental research is needed to explore and real ize the potential benefits to more advanced but expensive strongly coupled data assimilation, while continuing to pursue and implement weakly coupled me thods in current systems. Efforts to improve the skill of S2S predictions will also benefit from more realistic representation of the uncertainty and statisti cal properties of observations and model output. Research on Bayesian data assimilation and uncer tainty quantification has grown substantially in atmospheric and oceanic sciences and also in disciplines such as applied mathematics and engineering.

Recommendation G: Invest in research that advances the development of strongly coupled data assimilation and quantifies the impact of such advances on operational S2S forecast systems. Specifically: Continue to test and develop weakly coupled systems as operationally viable systems and as benchmarks for strongly coupled implementations. Further develop and evaluate hybrid assi milation methods, multiscale- and coupled- covariance update linear assimilation, and rigorous reduced- order stochastic modeling. Optimize the use of observations collected for the ocean, land surface, and sea ice components, in part through coupled-covarian ces and mutual information algorithms, and through autonomous adaptive sampling and observation targeting schemes. Further develop the joint estimation of c oupled states and parameters, as well as quantitative methods that discrimina te among, and learn, parameterizations. Develop methods and systems to fully utilize relevant satellite and in situ atmospheric information, especially for cl oudy and precipitati ng conditions. Foster interactions among the growing numb er of science and engineering communities involved in data assimilation, Bayesian in ference, and uncertainty quantification. Systematic errors are numerous within the Earth system models used for S2S forecasting. For example, many global models produce an unr ealistically strong Paci fic equatorial cold tongue, a spurious double Inter Tropical Converg ence Zone (ITCZ), erroneously high Indian Ocean and tropical South Atlantic SSTs, low SSTs in the tropical North Atlantic, wet or dry biases in rainfall in many parts of the world, and a bias in MJO variance. These model errors can be large compared to the predictable signals targeted by S2S forecasts. Reducing such model errors represents one of the most important ways to improve the skill of S2S predictions (Chapter 5, models subs ection). There is evidence that increasing the resolution of modeling systems (while still at resolutions that need deep convection parameterization) can reduce model errors. Howeve r, resolution is far from a panacea. Improving physical parameterizations of unresolved processes remains essential to reducing errors, even as the capability to resolve more and more processes expands. One important barrier to improving parameterizations is incomplete understanding of actual physical processes and the challenges associated with encapsulating new knowledge of these processes in (multiple, interacting) parameterizations. Coordinated, co upled field campaigns, as well as process-targeted satellite missions and other observations, are essential for developing the unders tanding required to improve parameterizations. To maximize impact, fi eld campaigns should, as far as possible, be co-designed by academics and operational centers and take full advantage of opportunities for national and international coordination. Continuing to develop high-resolution resear ch models will also be important for developing better parameterizations that reduce model errors. We note that model resolution Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 8: Vision and Way Forward for S2S Earth System Prediction 197 PREPUBLICATION COPY encompasses time and space resolution, but also a balance between the order of the numerical computation and the refinement of the discre tization. Further development of high resolution models will also be extremely beneficial for ex amining predictability on S2S timescales, and will help pave the way for future operational us e of global cloud and eddy-permitting models or cloud and eddy-permitting meshes in critical areas. This approach is becoming more feasible as scale-aware cumulus parameterization schemes ar e being developed. Finally, in parallel to spatiotemporal model resolution and parameteriza tions, incorporating new stochastic statistical methods is also important to advance S2S forecas ting. In particular, as described in Chapter 5, there are now several promising stochastic me thods and reduced-order partial differential equations that could provide improved probabilis tic forecasts for the same cost as running the present number of ensemble members. Furthermore, including efficient st ochastic components in S2S modeling systems has the potential to increase the skill of S2S probabilistic forecasts and benefit decision making. For example, stochastic computing and stochastic parameterizations of unresolved processes (Palmer, 2014) can be used to better represent rare but significant S2S events. To summarize, investment in research aimed at physical understanding and reducing model errors is seen by this Committee as a top priority in improving the skill of S2S predictions. In addition to contributing to Research Strate gy 2, reducing model errors also contributes to Strategies 3 and 4. Recommendation H: Accelerate research to improve parameterization of unresolved (e.g., subgrid scale) processes, both within S2S syst em submodels and holistically across models, to better represent coupling in the Earth system. Specifically: Foster long-term collaborations among scie ntists across academia and research and operational modeling centers, and across ocean, sea ice, land and atmospheric observation and modeling communities, to identify root causes of error in parameterization schemes, to correct these er rors, and to develop, test, and optimize new (especially scale-aware or independent) pa rameterization schemes in a holistic manner. Continue to investigate the potential for reducing model errors through increases in horizontal and vertical reso lutions in the atmosphere and other model components, ideally in a coupled model framew ork (see also Recommendation L). Encourage field campaigns targeted at incr easing knowledge of processes that are poorly understood or poorly represented in S2S m odels, including tropi cal convection, ocean mixing, polar, sea ice and stratospheric pro cesses, and coupling among different Earth system components (e.g., troposphere-str atosphere; dynamics- biogeochemistry). Develop high-resolution (e.g., that permit atmospheric deep convection and non-hydrosta tic ocean processes) to advance process understanding and promote the development of high-resolution operational prototypes (see also Recommendation I). Verification metrics are impor tant for tracking and comparing model improvements, and are also a critical part of enabling use and building trust in S2S forecasts.

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 198 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY different ways users interpret forecasts and what they consider to be skillful is necessary to inform the development of better verifi cation metrics (Recommendation B). Improving verification should also involve continued research on feature-ba sed and two-step verification methods, along with consideration of how the design of retrospec tive forecasts and reanalyses can influence the ability of some users to directly evaluate the consequences of acting on forecasts at various predicted probabilities. Recommendation J: Pursue feature-based verific ation techniques in order to more readily capture limited predictability at S2S timescale s, as part of a larger effort to improve S2S forecast verification. Specifically: Investigate methodologies for ensemble featur e verification including two-step processes linking features to cri tical user criterion. Pursue verification methodologies for rare and extreme events at S2S timescales, especially those related to multi-model ensemble predictions. Consider the benefits of producing more fre quent reanalyses using coupled S2S forecast systems in order for the initial conditions of retrospective fore casts to be more consistent with the real time forecasts, as well as for the purposes of predictability studies. Multi-model ensembles (MMEs) are one of the mo st promising ways to account for errors associated with Earth system model formulation, a nd the use of MMEs is likely to remain critical for S2S prediction. However, current MMEs are la rgely systems of opportun ity, and research is required to develop more intentional MME forecas t systems. S2S forecast systems, including the coupled Earth system model, the reanalysis, and retrospective forecasts, ca n be configured in a wide variety of ways. Careful optimizing of the configurations of a multi-model prediction system will include systematic exploration of th e benefits and costs of adding unique models to an MME. Today, little information is available about optimum configurations for individual or multi-model S2S ensemble forecast systems. It is lik ely that much can be gained in both skill and resource utilization by ascertaining which config urations produce optimum forecast systems, as defined by reliable probability forecasts and optimum levels of user-focused skill. Forecast centers, private sector users, and va lue-added providers use various calibration methods, but there has not been a comprehensive e ffort to compare methods or to find optimum approaches for the variables of most interest. Studies of the optimum configurations of S2S probability models (mentioned below) should include an attempt to evalua te calibration methods and ascertain whether some methods offer clear a dvantage over others, re cognizing that some of these methods will likely be application-specific. Exploring the \"trade space,\" i.e., the confi guration of S2S forecast systems, will be a large, complicated, and expensive endeavor, e xpanding as computer and Earth system modeling capabilities expand over the next decade or mo re, but determining how performance depends on configuration is a key task in any S2S research agenda. As suc h, this exploration would benefit tremendously from a central, coordinating author ity and central funding, as well. Exploring the \"trade space\" will be important for increasing for ecast skill, advancing the prediction of events Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Recommendation K: Explore systematically the im pact of various S2S forecast system design elements on S2S forecast skill. This includes examining the value of mo del diversity, as well as the impact of various selections and combinations of model re solution, number of ensemble perturbations, length of lead, averaging period, le ngth of retrospective forecasts, and options for coupled sub-models. Specifically: Design a coordinated program to assess the co sts and benefits of including additional processes in S2S systems, and relate those to benefits from other investments, for example in higher resolution. In doing so, take advantage of the oppor tunity to leverage experience and codes from the climate modeling community. Encourage systematic studies of the costs a nd benefits of increas ing the vertical and horizontal resolution of S2S models. Evaluate calibration methods and ascertain wh ether some methods offer clear advantage for certain applications over ot hers, as part of studies of the optimum configurations of S2S models. Explore systematically how many unique models in a multi-model ensemble are required to predict useful S2S parameters, and wh ether those models require unique data assimilation, physical parameterizations, or atmosphere, ocean, land, and ice components (see also Recommendation L). Transitioning new ideas, tools, and ot her technology between the S2S research community and operational cen ters is challenging but essential to translating research discoveries into informed decision making. In the S2S context, one key element of this transfer will be to bring the best research to bear on developing an operational MME S2S forecast system. The use of multi-model ensembles (MMEs) in non-operationa l, research settings has demonstrated the potential for advancing S2S forecasts, for ex ample the North American Multimodel Ensemble program (NMME) (see Chapter 6). An operational NMME relying on resear ch institutions for funding and operations is not a viable long-term option, but there would be great value in the development of an operational MME forecast system that includes the operational centers of the United States. Developing an operational MME forecasting sy stem will require careful optimizing of the configurations of a multi-model prediction system (Recommendation K). Test beds, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admini stration (NOAA) Climate Test Bed activity, provide the potential for such coordinating activities; however, the Test Bed would need significant enhancement if it were to be relied on as the primary mechanism for the development of a MME forecasting system. Where feasible, inte ragency and international collaborations could accelerate efforts to create an operational MME. Realistic assessment of available operational resources and centers that are ab le to contribute operationally rigorous prediction systems would be a useful starting point for de termining the best path forward. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 200 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY Recommendation L: Accelerate efforts to carefull y design and create robust operational multi- model ensemble S2S forecast systems. Specifically: Use test beds and interagency and intern ational collaborations where feasible to systematically explore the impact of various S2S forecast system design elements on S2S forecast skill, in particular the questi on how many unique models in a multi-model ensemble are required to predict operati onally useful S2S parameters (see also Recommendation K). Assess realistically the available operational resources and centers that are able to contribute operationally ri gorous prediction systems. To make the kind of rapid improvements to operational S2S predic tion systems that are envisioned by the Committee, it will be more generally important to speed the flow of information between scientists with research and operational foci. There are a number of mechanisms to improve the flow of technology into operational weather and ocean systems, including focused workshops, visi ting scientist program s, special sessions at professional conferences, testbeds and focused transition teams such as the Navy's development-and- operations transition teams a nd NSF/NOAA's Climate Process Teams. These mechanisms should be promoted and expanded to include mo re scientist involvement for plowing the new ground of S2S. New mechanisms should also be developed es pecially to enhance researcher access to operational forecast data, including access to ar chives of ensemble forecasts themselves, retrospective forecasts, and initia lization data. There are data st orage challenges with such an endeavor, but it would facilitate further analyses of sources of S2S predictability and efforts to diagnose skill, among other bene fits. The WWRP/WCRP S2S Project described in Chapters 4 and 6 is already making some operational center data available to the research community to study subseasonal processes, but S2S Project data is just begi nning to be explored by the research community. In the longer term, allowing researchers to conduct or request specific experiments on operational systems would provide an additional boost to the flow of discoveries and technical advances between research and operational communities. A llowing researchers to run operational models will be a difficult challenge , one that involves making the modeling code itself accessible to the research community as well as ensuring access to sufficient computing power to run the code. All of these actions will require a significant effort on the part of the operational centers. To improve the flow of advances between research and operations, operational centers should work towards addres sing these challenges ove r the next couple of decades. Recommendation M: Provide mechanisms for research and operational communities to collaborate, and aid in transitioning componen ts and parameterizations from the research community into operational cen ters, by increasing research er access to operational or operational mirror systems. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 8: Vision and Way Forward for S2S Earth System Prediction 201 PREPUBLICATION COPY Specifically: Increase opportunities for S2S researchers to participate in operational centers. Enhance interactions with th e international comm unity (e.g., the S2S Project and APCC) and with the WMO Lead Centers. Provide better access in the near-term to archived data from operational systems, potentially via test centers. Develop, in the longer term, the ability for researchers to request re-runs or do runs themselves of operational model forecasts. Encourage effective partnerships with th e private sector through ongoing engagement (see also Recommendation B). Research Strategy 3: Improve Prediction of Extreme and Disruptive Events and Consequences of Unanticipated Forcing Events Within the efforts to improve the overall skill of S2S forecasts and to provide more actionable information to users, there are two areas that the Committee believes deserve special attention (Research Strategies 3 and 4). Research Strategy 3 involves an increased focus on discrete events, and the Committee made two recommendations to address this focus. The first is to emphasize the prediction of weather, climate and other Earth system events that disrupt society's normal functioning. Weather extremes and other relatively infrequent events can greatly disrupt society's normal functioning and are therefore of signifi cant concern to many users: drought and flood, strong storms with excessive precipita tion, heat waves, and major wind events are all examples. A coordinated effort to improve the forecasting of these events could provide the huge benefits achieve d by allowing communities more time to plan for, and mitigate the damages from these events. Thus it is importa nt to explore the possibilities of using model output to suggest the likelihood of such disruptive events. For some of these events, a quantitative estimate of probability would provide the opportunity to consider whether specific mitigation actions are cost effective. But whethe r action is justified would depend on the skill of the forecasts for extreme events as determined by a history of such forecasts. Improved forecasting of extreme or disruptive events may entail an emphasis on forecasts of opportunity\u2014windows in time when expected skill for predicting specific events is high because of the presence of certain features in the Earth system \u2014rather than simply predicting average conditions for given time periods, as is done today. Skillful extended-range prediction of such events may only be possible for certain phase s of large-scale climate patterns, such as the seasonal cycle, ENSO, or MJO, or NAO, or may be contingent on interactions between these modes and other slowly varying pr ocesses. Moreover, skillful pr ediction of the probabilities of some types of disruptive events will be possibl e at these timescales, whereas others may not. Examples of events for which there is good ev idence for predictive skill melt- driven gnificant shifts in hurricane tracks or land-falling events in various ocean basins (Vecchi et al., 2011). More research is needed to investigate the potential sk ill for forecasts of different types of disruptive events, with a focus on discovering the potenti al for so-called forecasts of opportunity. In addition to the improved prediction of events within the Earth system, there are events driven by outside forces that have major\u2014a nd potentially predictable\u2014consequences on the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 202 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY Earth system. Such outside for ces include volcanoes, meteor im pacts, and human actions (e.g., aerosol emissions, widespread fires, large oil spills, certain acts of war, or climate intervention). Over the past 25 years, there have been a number of these unusual natural or human-caused events that have had, or were in itially feared to have, the possibi lity of large-scale consequences to the Earth system (Chapters 3 and 6) and acco mpanying adverse impacts to a wide range of human activities. Some consequences of high-impact events ar e predictable on timescales of weeks to a year. These events are unusual because they are of a nature or magnitude not represented within the recent past (for instance sinc e the start of observational sate llite climate records in about 1979), and hence do not have well-observed analogs that can be used to validate prediction systems. Moreover, depending on the nature of the event, the operational forecast systems may not be suited for predicting the event's conseque nces. While some of these events, such as the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, had clear consequences for the global system for a year and beyond (0.3 \u00b0C global-mean cooling averaged over the 3 years following the Pinatubo eruption), many other events had much smaller impacts than originally projected. However, these were notable in raising significant publ ic concern that might have re quired action by decision makers. Recommendations The improved prediction of extreme or di sruptive events on S2S timescales is an extension of improvements in S2S forecasti ng skill (Research Strategy 2). But given the importance of having actionable information about these events for users and decision makers (Research Strategy 1), the Committee believes it is important to highli ght the prediction of events as a separate strategy. Improving the pr ediction of such events will involve improved understanding of sources of pred ictability of extreme and disr uptive events in the S2S time range. It will also involve en suring that all relevant source s of predictability and their interactions are represented in Ea rth system models (Chapter 4). Recommendation D: Focus predictability studies, proce ss exploration, model development and forecast skill advancements on high impact S2 S \"forecasts of opportunity \" that in particular target disruptive and extreme events (e.g. tropic al cyclones, mesoscale convection, topographic forcing, coastal surge). Specifically: Determine how predictability sources (e.g. na tural modes of variab ility, slowly varying processes, external forcing) and their multi-scale interactions can influence the occurrence, evolution and amp litude of extreme and disruptiv e events using long-record and process-level observations. Ensure the relationships between disruptive and extreme weather/environmental events\u2014 or their proxies\u2014and sources of S2S predicta bility (e.g. modes of na tural variability and slowly varying processes) are repr esented in S2S forecast systems. Investigate and estimate the predictability a nd prediction skill of disruptive and extreme events through utilization and further devel opment of forecast and retrospective forecast databases, such as those from the S2S Project and the NMME. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 8: Vision and Way Forward for S2S Earth System Prediction 203 PREPUBLICATION COPY The second part of this research strategy i nvolves using S2S forecast systems to predict the consequences of disruptive events caused by an unusual Earth system event, like a volcanic eruption or a major oil spill. Such an outside event generates an immediate demand for scientific guidance for the public and policy-makers about pot ential consequences. A flexible system for estimating Earth system consequences of such unusual forcing events wo uld address a national need that has become evident several times over the past few decades. The nation should develop a capability for es timating the range of possible impacts and consequences of unexpected but critical events such as volcanic erupti ons, nuclear detonations, widespread fires, or large spills of toxic materials (C hapters 3 and 6). Such a capability would need to be mobilized within one week and re turn preliminary results for S2S timescales and beyond as appropriate. Performing regular full-scale exercises in co llaboration with the response community in the spirit of war games would help improve this capability and maintain it for any new event. This could serve as a focal point and help to improve the connections of advances in the academic sector in modeling unexpected even ts with operational model development. Recommendation N: Develop a national capabil ity to forecast the consequences of unanticipated forcing events. Specifically: Improve the coordination of government agencies and academics to be able to quickly respond to unanticipated events to provide S2 S forecasts and associated responses using the unanticipated events as sources of predictability. Utilize emerging applications of Earth system models for long-range transport and dispersion processes (e.g., of aerosols). Increase research on the generation, valida tion, and verification of forecasts for the aftermath of unanticipated forcing events. Research Strategy 4: Include More Components of the Earth System in S2S Forecast Models The other area that the Committee feels needs more focused attention is accelerating the development of Earth system model component s outside the troposphere \u2014Research Strategy 4. As mentioned above, representing oceans, sea ice, land surface and hydrology, and biogeochemical cycles (including aerosol and air quality) in coupl ed Earth system models is more important for S2S predictions than for trad itional weather prediction , because much of the predictability of the Earth system on these timescales arises from conditions outside the troposphere or from interactions between Eart h system components. Operational S2S forecast systems increasingly utilize coupled Earth system models that include major Earth system components (e.g., ocean, atmosphere, ice, land) (Brassington et al., 2015; Brunet et al., 2010). However, the representation of processes outsi de the troposphere has generally been less well developed. Improving model representation of land surface and terrestr ial hydrology, ocean, sea ice, and upper atmosphere\u2014including fluxes and feedbacks between these components\u2014will be Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 204 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY important for increasing the skill of S2S forecas ts. This includes advancing the observations, modeling, data assimilation, and integrated pred iction capabilities in those components. Those components that have significant interactions wi th the weather and climate system as a whole will need to be dynamically integrated into the op erational forecasting systems. Other fields that do not contribute substantially to the evolution of the rest of th e system could be predicted by post-processing operations or by independent activi ties after the primary forecasts have been carried out. However, as demand grows for forecas ts of phenomena that are predictable on S2S timescales but that do not feedback strongl y to the atmosphere, improving the dynamical representation of many of these Earth system processes in S2S prediction systems may also become important in its own right. Representing interactions between the va rious Earth system components has become increasingly important for climate projections . Comprehensive Earth system models (ESMs), which include composition, aerosols, vegetation, s now and glaciers, etc., are increasingly being used to provide projections on decadal to centennial timescales (e.g., Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 [CMIP5]; IPCC, 2013; Taylor et al., 2012). The extension of operational S2S forecasts towards dynamic predic tions of more of the Earth system will be carried out most effectively by le veraging these existing efforts. Recommendations Improving the representation of more component s and variables of the Earth system in S2S forecasts, including the ocean, sea ice, biogeochemistry, and land surface, will produce information applicable to a new and wider range of decisions. Iterative interaction with forecast users (Research Strategy 1) can he lp determine what processes a nd variables are most important to include in coupled S2S systems as these sy stems evolve. Expanding the comprehensiveness of such component models and advancing their coup ling in Earth system models will also help improve the overall skill of fo recasts (Research Strategy 2). Priorities for improving ocean models incl ude both fundamental numerical capabilities and improved depictions of important oceanic phenomena that are currently omitted from most S2S forecasting systems, for example tides and thei r interactions with storm surges, and oceanic mixing of nutrients. The dynamics of the near su rface ocean are of partic ular importance for the coupled ocean at S2S timescales, so the representation of ocean boundary layer turbulence and its interactions with waves and sea ice are a promising subject of study for improving S2S forecasts. But the most important limitation on oceanic S2S forecasts arises from the global influence of the ocean at these timescales, al ong with the need to accu rately represent many important oceanic phenomena at relatively small s cales to capture this influence. Implementing a regionally eddy-resolving ocean component along with additional research on parameterizing the effects of unresolved baroclinic and sub-mesoscal e oceanic eddies would thus help improve S2S coupled prediction models. Sea ice models used for S2S often cont ain only rudimentary thermodynamics and dynamics. Connecting advances in cutting-edge s ea ice models (including more sophisticated physics representations of i ce-thickness distri bution, melt ponds, biogeochemistry, and divergence/convergence, as well as new methods to account for wave-floe interactions, blowing snow, and ice microstructure) with sea ice mode ls used in S2S forecast system could advance Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Chapter 8: Vision and Way Forward for S2S Earth System Prediction 205 PREPUBLICATION COPY S2S predictions of the atmosphere through im proved representation of radiative and ocean feedbacks, as well as advancing S2S predic tion of sea ice and polar ocean conditions. Similarly, land-surface models used for S2S pr ediction need to improve treatment of the hydrological cycle and aspects of the land surf ace that are coupled to hydrology, such as vegetation. Effort is needed to incorporate surface and underground wa ter storage and river routing in models, including th e role of human water management and use. These important aspects of the land system have been implemen ted in \"off-line\" hydrologic forecast systems, but they are usually over-simplified or neglected altogether in fully coupled S2S forecast systems. Improving the representation of land surface proce sses such as soil moisture storage and snow may in such fully coupled systems will be importa nt for predicting events such as heat waves, cold surges, storm formation, and predicting run-o ff may also help to enable S2S forecasts of flooding and lake and coastal hypoxia. Additional strong candidates for improvement s to existing practice for operational S2S forecasting systems include advancing the observations, modeling, data assimilation, and integrated prediction capabilities of aerosols and air quality, and aquatic and marine ecosystems. Beyond advancing the representation of the la nd surface, hydrology, stratosphere, sea ice, ocean, and biogeochemical models and translatin g these advancements to the coupled Earth system models used for S2S forecasting, effort s are needed to pave the way towards global cloud/eddy-resolving atmosphere-ocean-land-sea ice coupled models, which will one day become operational for S2S prediction. While this goal is unlikely to be reached in the next decade, revolutions in the computing industry may shorten the distance between now and the otherwise long way to go, and the S2S research community needs to be proactive and poised if/when that happens. Recommendation I: Pursue next-generation ocean, sea ice, wave, bioge ochemistry, and land surface/hydrologic, as well as atmospheric mo del capability in fully coupled Earth system models used in S2S forecast systems. Specifically: Build a robust research program to explore po tential benefits to S2S predictive skill and to forecast users from adding more advanced Earth system components in forecast systems. Initiate new efficient partnerships between academics and operational centers to create the next generation model components that can be easily integrated into coupled S2S Earth system models. Support and expand model coupling frameworks to link ocean/atmosphere/land/wave/ice models inter-operably for rapidly and easil y exchanging flux and variable information. Develop a strategy to transition high reso lution (cloud/eddy-resolving) atmosphere- ocean-land-sea ice coupled models to ope rations, including strategies for new parameterization schemes, data assimilation procedures, and multi-model ensembles (MME).

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 206 Next Generation Earth System Prediction PREPUBLICATION COPY It is essential to highlight two specific cros s-cutting challenges that must be met in order to support the four research st rategies for reaching the Committee's vision for S2S prediction. These are ensuring that the co mputational infrastructure is sufficient to support the S2S forecasting enterprise; and developing and maintaini ng the workforce that will be needed realize potential advances in S2S forecasting. These challenges are not necessarily unique to the S2S enterprise\u2014they are also faced by the numeri cal weather prediction and climate modeling communities, and indeed, across many other technical enterprises. Recommendations The volume of observational data, data assim ilation steps, model outputs, and reanalysis and retrospective forecasts involved in S2S for ecasting means that the S2S modeling process is extremely data intensive. S2S prediction systems test the limits of current cyber-infrastructure, as do weather forecasting and climate modeling. A dvances in S2S forecast models (higher resolutions, increased complexity, the generation and retention of long retrospective forecasts, etc.), will require dramatically increased computing capacities (p erhaps 1,000 times), and similar expansion of related storage and data transport capacities. That said, today's Earth system models are not taking full advantage of current computing architectures and improving their perfor mance will likely require new algorithms that do more to work on data locally before transporting it to those analyzing it, as well as significant refactoring of existing algorithms to exploit mo re parallelism. To compound these challenges, the transition to new computing hardware and so ftware through the next decade will be highly disruptive. This transition will not involve faster processing elements, but rather more processors with considerably more complex embodiments of concurrency. In addition, future storage technology will be more complex and varied than it is today, and leveraging these innovations will require fundamental software changes. An integrative modeling environment presents an appealing future option for facing some of the large uncertainty about th e evolution of hardware and pr ogramming models over the next two decades. New approaches to data-centric work flow software that incorporates parallelism, remote analysis, and data compression will be re quired to keep up with the demands of the S2S forecasting community. Recommendation O: Develop a national plan and investment strategy for S2S prediction to take better advantage of current hardware and software and to meet the challenges in the evolution of new hardware and software for all stages of the prediction process, including data assimilation, operation of high-resolution co upled Earth system m odels, and storage and management of results. Specifically: Redesign and recode S2S models and data assi milation systems so they will be capable of exploiting current and future massively parall el computational capabilities; this will require a significant and long-te rm investment in computer scientists, software engineers, applied mathematicians, and statistics researchers in partnership with the S2S researchers.

As highlighted in Chapters 3 and 6, the Committee believes there are significant challenges in maintaining a pipeli ne of talented workers in the S2S enterprise. S2S is complex and involves working across computing-Earth sc ience boundaries to develop and improve S2S models and working across science-user decisi on boundaries to better design and communicate forecast products and decision tools. From the limited data available, it appears that the pipeline of S2S modelers being trained is not growing robustly in the United States, and is not keeping pace with this rapidly evolving field (Chapter 7). Given the importance of S2S pr edictions to the nation, a concerted effort is needed to entrain, develop, and re tain a robust S2S workforce. Similar to weather forecasting, S2S forecasts ar e used or have the pot ential to be used by many people to make important decisions. Becaus e S2S connects in a very public way to risk management, there will be many opportunities within the S2S enterprise to help society better manage risks. These factors can be exploited to entrain more talented and mission-driven people into the field. One possible concrete step forward would be a series of workshops to explore how to feature S2S in more undergraduate and graduate curriculums, how to identify and connect with organizations that can help with this (e.g., th e National Science Teacher s Association), and how to interact with the private sector to help unde rstand what skills are n eeded. Other entities such as American Meteorological Society (AMS) or the National Science Foundation (NSF) could also play an important role in coordinati ng the entrainment of talented young people. Recommendation P: Pursue a collection of ac tions to address workforce development that removes barriers that exist across the entire wo rkforce pipeline and in the diversity of scientists and engineers involved in advan cing S2S forecasting and the component and coupled systems. Specifically: Gather quantitative information about work force requirements and expertise base to support S2S modeling in order to more fu lly develop such a training program and workforce pipeline.

Expand interdisciplinary programs to train a more robust workforce to be employed in boundary organizations that work in between S2S model developers and those who use forecasts. Integrate basic meteorology and climatology into academic disciplines, such as business and engineering, to improve the capacity with in operational agencies and businesses to create new opportunities fo r use of S2S information. Provide more graduate and postgraduate tr aining opportunities, e nhanced professional recognition and career advancement, and adequate incentives to encour age top students in relevant scientific and computer prog ramming disciplines to choose S2S model development and research as a career. CONCLUSION This report envisions a substa ntial improvement in S2S pred iction capability and expects valuable benefits to flow from these improve ments to a wide range of public and private activities. It sets forth a res earch agenda that describes what must be done\u2014with observations, data management, computer modeling, and inte ractions with users\u2014 to advance prediction capability and improve societal benefits. Despite the specificity of the report in r ecommending what should be done, it does not address the challenging issues of how the agen da should actually be pursued\u2014who will do what and how the work will be supported financially. Gi ven that this research agenda significantly expands the scope of the current S2S efforts, the Committee believes that some progress can be made with current levels of support and within current organi zational structures, but fully achieving the S2S vision will likely require addi tional resources for basic and applied research, observations, and forecast operations. The scope of th e research agenda will also require closer collaboration between federal agencies and interna tional partners, better flow of ideas and data between the research and operational forecasting communities, and engagement of the entire weather and climate enterprise. The four research strategies provide broad guidance for how to focus effort, and the recommendations under each strategy in and of themselves represent the Committee's view of the most important actions to advance S2S for ecasting, presented without any prioritization or sequencing. The technological, politi cal, and financial environment in which the research agenda will be implemented is constantly changing and w ill continue to be fluid, and multiple pathways to success exist. As such, the Committee believes it was more important to provide a list of the most important areas where progress can be made towards improving S2S forecasts without overly prescribing the sequence or priority in which they should be addressed. All of these actions can improve S2S forecasting and the more that is done to implement these recommendations, the more advances can be made. To help agencies and other actors within th e weather/climate enterp rise select specific parts of the research agenda to pursue, Table 8.1 provides additional details about both the main recommendations and more specific or related ac tivities the Committee envi sions to be part of Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

While recognizing that it might not be possible to pu rsue all of these actions simultaneously, the Committee hopes that these strategies, recomm endations, and designati ons can help guide progress across the span of recommended S2S research and forecasting activities. The vision for the future of S2S forecasting can be achieved with a national will to pursue this research agenda and to convert the result s into daily operations. The more that can be pursued within this research agenda, the clos er the nation can be to wards realizing the full potential of S2S forecasting and th e more benefits that can be pr oduced for a wide range of users and the nation as a whole. TABLE 8.1 The Committee's 16 main recommendations\u2014l ettered in the orde r they appear in the report\u2014are shown in bold typeface along with information to help guide their implementation. The Committee sometimes recommends more specific or re lated activities that they envision to be part of implementing each main recommendation. These are listed in plain text under each main recommendation. The second column indicates the research strategy that each recommendation and associated activity primar ily supports (colors are the same as in Figure 8.1). Additional research strate gies (1-4) supported by each recommendation are indicated by numbers. The final columns contain the Comm ittee's opinion on whether each recommendation will involve mainly basic or applied research/ope rational activities, or both; whether a short-term return-on-investment is likely ( 5 years); and whether a new initiative or program, or a significant expansion of a program, may be necessary to implement each recommendation. The last column indicates recomme ndations for which the Committee believes that international collaboration and coordination is particularly important. Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts PREPUBLICATION COPY 263 Appendix B: Details of Seasonal and Subseasonal Forecast Systems EXAMPLES OF MODELS USED BY OP ERATIONAL CENTERS FOR SUBSEASONAL AND SEASONAL FORECASTING At the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the Climate Forecasting System version 2 (CFSv2) is currently used for both the subseasonal and seasonal predictions. CFSv2 is a fully coupled model representing th e interaction between the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, land, and sea ice (Saha et al., 2014). It became operational at NCEP in March 2011. The atmospheric model has a horizontal resolution of T126 (about 100 km) and 64 vertical levels. The ocean component is the Modular Ocean Model developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) with 0.5 to 0.25 degr ee resolution and 40 vertical levels, with interactive sea ice model. For the subseasonal forecast (defined by NCEP as days 0-45), 16 members are run every day (4 members run four times a day at 00Z, 06Z, 12Z and 18Z). The retrospective forecasts are done from 1999 to 2010, four members a day. For the seasonal forecast (defined by NCEP as months 0-9), four runs per day are perf ormed. The retrospective forecasts are constructed with four members run every fifth day for the past 29 years (1982- 2010). The European Centre for Medium-Range W eather Forecasting (ECMWF) utilizes two different systems for the subseasonal and s easonal predictions. The operational seasonal forecasting system, known as System 4, was impl emented in 2011. The atmospheric model is the ECMWF Integrated Forecast Syst em (IFS) model frozen version 36r4. It has a horizontal resolution of TL255 (~60km) and 91 vertical leve ls. The ocean component is from the Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean (NEMO), with the ORCA1 configuration, which has a 1x1 degree resolution in mid-latitudes and enhanced meridional resolution near the equator. The retrospective forecast is done from 1981 to 2010 for 15 members for 7 months initialized with ECMWF Interim Reanalysis (ERA Interim) on the 1st day of each month. The seasonal forecasts consist of a 51-member ensemble. The ensemble is constructed by combining the 5-member ensemble ocean analysis with SST perturbations and the activation of stochastic physics. The forecasts have an initial date of the 1st of each month, and run for 7 months. For the subseasonal prediction, ECMWF's monthly forecasting system is used. The atmospheric model is the same version as ECMWF's deterministic forecast. The atmospheric model is run at TL639 resolution from day 0 to day 10 and at T319 from day 10 to 32 with 62 vertical levels. The ocean component is also NEMO with the ORCA1 conf iguration. 51 members run to 46 days twice a week (Monday and Thursday at 00Z). The ocean and atmosphere models are fully coupled, and the retrospective forecasts are constructed with 11 members run at the same day and month as the Thursday real time forecast over the past 20 years. Additional details about these and other operational seasonal forecast systems are shown in Table B.1, and Table B.2 provides sim ilar information for subseasonal systems.

It took place in the summer of 1974 over the tropical Atlantic Ocea n from Africa to Sout h America. Twenty countries participated in GATE with 40 research ships, 12 res earch aircraft, and numerous buoys. These data are still being used today in research. Over a thousa nd papers have been published based on the GATE data. A major breakthrough of GATE is the recognition of organized mesoscale convective systems as the main sources of precipitation and convective energy in the tropics. Among others, the GATE soundings have been used as a golden standard in the development of cumulus parameterizati on in weather and climate models. TOGA COARE (Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment) \u2014 TOGA COARE was the second major international field campaign in the tropics. Its goal was to describe and understa nd the principal processe s responsible for the coupling and multi-scale variability of the ocean and atmosphere in the western Pacific and their interaction with other regions. The field experiment took pl ace over the western Pacific during November 1992 through February 1993. Eighteen c ountries participated in TOGA CAORE with 12 ships 7 airplanes, and more than 40 moor ings. Close to a thousa nd papers have been published that are rela ted to TOGA COARE. Among many of its outcomes, the one that contribute most significantly to model impr ovement is the COARE flux algorithm that is recognized as the best flux scheme that can be used in models and observational diagnostics. VOCAL-REx (The VAMOS52 Ocean-Cloud-Atmosphere-Land Study Regional Experiment) \u2014 VOCAL-REx is another example of multi-nation collaboration to address interactive processes of different components of the Earth system . It objectives are to understand links between aerosols, clouds and precipitati on and their impacts on marine stratocumulus radiative properties, and physical and chemical couplings between the upper ocean and the lower atmosphere, including the role of mesoscale ocean eddies. It took place during October and November 2008 on and off shore of Chile. Eight count ries participated in the field experiment with 5 research aircraft, 2 ships and 2 surface sites in northern Chile. A major breakthrough of VOCAL-REx is the understanding of the strong role aerosol-cloud-prec ipitation coupling plays in marine low clouds, which had previously be en thought as controlled mainly by dynamics. Data collected by VOCAL-REx have played cruc ial roles in developing and refining new parameterization schemes that are used in regional and global models. SHEBA (The Surface Heat Budg et of the Arctic Ocean)- SHEBA is an international research program designed to document, unders tand, and predict the phys ical processes that 51 Global Atmosphere Research Program 52 Variability of the American Monsoon Systems Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 268 Appendix C PREPUBLICATION COPY determine the surface energy budget and the sea-ice ma ss balance in the Arctic. Its overall goal is to acquire the measurements need ed to improve the parameteriza tions of key processes and to integrate new and improved parameterizations into general circulati on and climate models. Scientists from 7 countries participated in SH EBA. The SHEBA field experiment was a yearlong (2 October 1997-12 October 1998) measurement on a dr ifting station in the p ack ice of the Arctic Ocean. The drift station made meas urement of the vertical column of the ocean, sea ice, and the atmosphere. It was augmented by a buoy array, research aircraft, he licopter surveys, and submarine transects on a larger sc ale. SHEBA data provide up to date the first and only annual cycle of the surface energy budget for multi-year Artic ice. They helped improve understanding of many processes critical to the surface ener gy balance and variability, including supercooled liquid water and advective events from lower latitudes. Knowle dge gained from SHEBA data have led to new and improved parameteri zation of melt ponds, cloud microphysics, and turbulence. AMMA (The African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis) \u2014 AMMA is an international project with an objective of improving our knowle dge and understanding of the West African monsoon, as well as the envir onmental and socio-economic impacts of its variability. It is the biggest pr ogram of research on environment and climate issues in Africa. AMMA involved a comprehensive field experiment including ocean, land and atmospheric measurements in many West African nations and their adjacent seas, on hourly, daily and up to seasonal timescales over a number of years. Th e field campaign consisted of a long-term monitoring program (2001-2009) based on the existi ng infrastructure, an Enhanced Observing Period (2005-2007) with specific land-based and sea-based inst ruments, and four Special Observing Periods in 2006 with intensive measur ements from the surface (continent-based and ocean-based) and from the air (research aircra ft and balloons) that monitored the pre-monsoon dry season, as well as the onset, peak, and decay of the monsoon. Data collected by the AMMA field campaign have greatly advanced our know ledge on coupling between the atmosphere, land and ocean, and between dynamics, physics, chem istry, biology, and hydrology. These data have also been used in validation and development of global and regional climate and weather models and specific process models (Lebel et al., 2010). AMY (Asian Monsoon Year)- AMY was a cross-cutting co ordinated observation and modeling initiative partic ipated by more than twenty countries. The objectives of AMY are to enhance understanding of ocean-land-atmosphere -biosphere interactions, multiple timescale (from diurnal to intra-seasonal) interaction, and the aerosol-water cycle interaction in the Asian monsoon system, in order to improve their physical representations in coupled climate models, and to develop data assimilation for the ocean -atmosphere-land system in the Asian monsoon region. Its majority of field observations t ook place during 2008-2010, with 23 field campaigns throughout the Asian monsoon region in four ta rgeted periods: the pre-monsoon period in March-May, the monsoon onset phase in May- June; the monsoon mature phase in July-August; and the winter monsoon from December to February. Among many results, AMY data have revealed how the diurnal cycle, intraseasonal os cillation, and monsoon flow interact to general extreme rainfall that led to flood events with tremendous socioeconomic impacts. DYNAMO (Dynamics of the Ma dden-Julian Oscillation) \u2014 DYNAMO was the most recent international field campaign aiming at th e tropical atmosphere-ocean system. Its overall goal was to improve understanding the processes key to MJO initiation. Based on its three main hypotheses on the roles of conv ection-environment interactio n, evolution of cloud population, and air-sea interaction, DYNAMO's intensive sounding and radar arra ys over the central Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts Appendix C 269 PREPUBLICATION COPY equatorial Indian Ocean colle cted data from October 2011 to February 2012 and its broad sounding network continued data co llection until March 2012. Sixteen countries participated in DYNAMO with four research vesse ls, 2 airplanes, 5 special ground stations, and several sites of enhanced radiosondes. While DYNAMO data are still being analyzed, initial results have revealed new findings in regime change of aer osol and evolution of cloud microphysics through the MJO life cycle, interaction between the MJO and ITCZ, and ocean memory of MJO forcing through mixing related to prolonge d vertical current shear, am ong others. DYNAMO data have been used in testing parameterization of cl oud microphysics and convective cold pools and in helping validate numerical models of the atmosp here and ocean of different configurations and complexities. CURRENT AND FUTURE PROCESS STUDIES YOPP (The Year of Polar Prediction) \u2014 YOPP (mid-2017 to mid-2019) is an international program that coordinates a peri od of intensive observing, modeling, verification, user-engagement and education activities for th e purpose of enabling a significant improvement in environmental prediction capabilities for th e polar regions and beyond on a wide range of timescales. The observational component of YOPP is built upon several elements. A major one is MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate), which will deploy a polar research vessel starting in newl y formed Arctic sea ice around September 2018, and drifting with the ice over th e course of a year, to study a full annual cycle of coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean-biogeochemical system processes. Other observational activities will include intensive observing periods (IOPs) during which aircraft flights and other research vessels will be deployed. In addition, land-based stations as part of the Sustaining Arctic Observing Network (SAON) provide numerous obser vations of Arctic system through staffed observatories and autonomous in struments. Many model experiments on a hierarchy of scales will be conducted, aimed at understanding and improving model predictability. Many countries will participate in the YOPP field observations. SOCRATES (Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiat ion, Aerosol Transport Experimental Study)- SOCRATES is another on-going international field experiment, which will take place in 2016 -2019 in a region where numerical models perform particularly poorly. Its primary objective is to collect a data set suitable to study interactions betw een microphysics dynamics and radiation in mixed-phase and supercooled cl ouds. It includes four themes: Synoptically varying vertical structure of boundary layers and clouds, Seasonal and synoptic variability in cloud condensation and ice nucleus concentration and the role of local biogenic sources, Supercooled liquid and mixed phase clouds, and Satellite re trievals related to clouds, precipitation, and aerosols. Five countries participate will in it s field observations aboard ships (July -September 2017 and January -March 2018), airplanes and pilotless aircraft (January - March 2018), ground stations (several IOPs during 2016 -2019), and moorings (January 2016 - December 2019). SOCRATES observations will be used to advance our understanding of the variability of Southern Ocean cloud systems on a broad scale and their underpinning processes, such as aerosol physicoche mical properties, aerosol cloudprecipitation interactions, and to reduce model biases in this region. YMC (Years of the Maritime Continent) \u2014 YMC is a two-year (planned for mid-2017 -mid-2019) international project with its goal of \"obs erving the weather-clim ate system of the Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.Next Generation Earth System Prediction: Strategies for Subseasonal to Seasonal Forecasts 270 Appendix C PREPUBLICATION COPY Earth's largest archipel ago to improve understanding and pred iction of its local variability and global impact\". There are five YMC Prediction Improvement. YMC will engage in five main activities: Data Sharing, Field Campaigns, Modeling, Prediction and Applications, and Outreach and Capacity Building. Scientists from 13 countries are participating in th e planning of YMC. The platform for the YMC field experiment will include numerous research ve ssels, airplanes, suites of ground facilities, mobile radars, and oceanic autonomous devices and moorings. These special instruments will be augmented by the regional observing networks of radars, radiosond es, surface meteorological and climatological observations, and marine stations. Cloud-permitting da ta assimilation products will be made to synthesize data to be collected by the field e xperiment and the observing networks. YMC data will be used to test and evaluate parameterization schemes in climate models, which have suffered from several severe biases in the Maritime Continent region. Process Study for the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ)- The MIZ refers to the region near the sea ice edge where sea ice con centrations are low and floes are small enough to permit the influx of ocean waves. The MIZ is widest in late su mmer, and the summertime width in the Arctic has broadened significantly in recent decades (S trong and Rigor, 2013). The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is already c onducting a five-year study of the Arctic MIZ that began in 2012, with project web site 53 and science and experimental plan (Lee et al., 2012). Th e project has an extensive observational component that extensively utilizes autonomous sampling with sea gliders and acoustically tracked floats, both of which can measure under sea ice. An array of buoys measures wave heights and ice mass balance. A goal of the project is to improve estimates of wave-floe interactions and develop methods of modeling the sea ice floe size distributions. Three models are taking part in the project. All three are Arctic regional models, and only one has an atmosphere component (the other two ar e ocean-sea ice only). One of the ocean-sea ice only modeling groups is undertaking the developmen t of floe size distri bution capability (Zhang et al., 2015). The other two ar e specializing in fine resolu tion (up to 1/12 degree). 53 http://www.apl.washington.e du/project/project.php?id=miz, accessed January 27, 2016.
