What Is Witch Hazel? Witch hazel has existed in its commercial form for about 150 years but has been in use for much longer. It looks unassuming in its clear plastic bottle like it could be just plain water. Actually, though, it's an extract produced from the leaves and bark of witch-hazel plants, Hamamelis virginiana\u2014one of three species of deciduous flowering shrubs found in North America, both in the wild and as ornamental garden shrubs. The plant features shiny, green oval leaves ranging in length from just under two inches to just over six and arranged alternately along the branches. Yellow or orange flowers appear on the plant in the fall or winter, depending on the species. It occurs naturally throughout the eastern half of the United States and Canada. What's In A Name? Though witch hazel's healing powers are pretty magical, the word \"witch\" in its name actually has nothing to do with witches. Rather, it comes from the Old English word wiche, which meant \"pliant\" or \"bendable.\" The term had been used in the names of several plant species in Europe for hundreds of years before it was applied to the genus Hamamelis in North America. Other popular names for witch hazel include \"snapping hazel\" and \"winterbloom.\" Medicinal Properties of Witch Hazel Its medicinal properties were well known to Native Americans, who used it for a variety of purposes, including to treat swelling, inflammation, tumors, and other skin ailments. Puritan colonists got wind of the plant's potential almost as soon as they arrived in North America, and began making their own extracts. By the mid-19th Century, companies had begun to produce extracts of the plant for commercial sale.
