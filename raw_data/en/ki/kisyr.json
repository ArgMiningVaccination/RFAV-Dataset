Student Disability Services promotes diversity by striving to provide equal access to qualified students with disabilities. Recognizing that the chiropractic profession will benefit from the skills and talents of persons with differing abilities, and in compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The goal of services for students with disabilities is to provide you with an equal opportunity to participate in the educational experience and to demonstrate what you know. All documentation and information is confidential, except for college officials who have a compelling educational need to know. Requesting an Accommodation Once a student provides the Student Disability Services Coordinator with the necessary paperwork, the student and the student Disability Coordinator will review the documentation, in addition to an interactive discussion about the student's request. The Disability Services Coordinator works with students to design a program of academic and/or testing accommodations. Reasonable academic adjustments and/or accommodations are designed to provide equal opportunity to students with disabilities.
