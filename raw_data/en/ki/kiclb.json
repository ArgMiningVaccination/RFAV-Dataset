In the past, Perry Memorial Hospital has employed many different methods to assess the health needs of the area it serves and has adjusted its services to meet those identified needs. Recent changes to federal laws governing not-for-profit hospitals now require 501(c)3 hospitals to conduct a local community health needs assessment, following specific guidelines, every three years and to report the completion of the assessment as part of their corporate tax filings with the Internal Revenue Service. Since Perry Memorial is a municipal hospital, it is not required; however, the hospital board of directors determined that Perry would participate to provide consistency in its planning process with other hospitals in the state of Illinois. Assessing community health needs through a review of available health data and discussions with area health care partners, community leaders and representatives of the many groups served by the hospital gave Perry Memorial Hospital and its health care partners the opportunity to identify and address the area's most pressing health care needs. Scope of Assessment Perry Memorial Hospital elected to conduct a community health needs assessment in 2012. The community health needs assessment was developed and conducted by a consultant provided through the Illinois Critical Access Hospital Network (ICAHN). ICAHN is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation, established in 2003 for the purposes of sharing resources, education, promoting operational efficiencies and improving health care services for member critical access hospitals and their rural communi-ties. ICAHN, with 51 member hospitals, is an independent network governed by a nine-member board of directors with standing and project development committees facilitating the overall activities of the network. ICAHN continually strives to strengthen the capacity and viability of its members and rural health providers. Perry Memorial Hospital is a member of the Illinois Critical Access Hospital Network. The community health needs assessment will serve as a guide for planning and implementation of health care initiatives that will allow the hospital and its partners throughout the service area to best serve the emerging health needs of the Princeton area.Perry Memorial Hospital provides compassionate, quality health services to the people andcommunities it serves.Community Health Needs AssessmentPerry Memorial Hospital | 4Methodology and Gaps Discussion The community health needs assessment was conducted through a consulting arrangement with the Illinois Critical Access Hospital Network. Terry Madsen, an ICAHN consultant, attorney and former educator and community development specialist, met with hospital executive staff to define the community, scope of the project and special needs and concerns. An internal working group, possible local sources for secondary data and key external contacts were identified and a timeline was established. Possible avenues for gathering primary data were reviewed and it was determined to proceed with three focus groups - comprised of area heath care professionals/partners, community officials and community leaders and groups. Potential information gaps exist in the service area because of the absence of population concentrations in Princeton and the Perry Memorial Hospital primary service area that could represent target groups of concern in other locations except the population of persons of Hispanic origin. This assessment has explored the insular needs of the identified group by specifically seeking input from persons with knowledge of the specific health concerns of the group. Input was also sought from members of the community charged professionally with advancing the health and education of the community and all its members, including school officials dealing daily with youth and families. As with many rural areas, secondary data is often a year or more out-of-date which highlights the importance of historic trends in that data in the service area. Secondary data from state and federal sources, which are cited in text, was reviewed by the consultant and compared to the primary data gathered. Identified needs were prioritized through that process and presented to hospital administration for review. Community Health Needs AssessmentPerry Memorial Hospital | 5COMMUNITY Geographic Assessment Area Defined The Perry Memorial Hospital community was identified through a facilitated meeting with senior staff as a geographic area determined to be the current primary hospital catchment area, which includes all or portions of the zip code service areas surrounding Princeton, Wyanet, Tiskilwa, Walnut, Henry, Sheffield, Ohio, Buda, Putnam, Mineral, Neponset, Bradford and Kewanee. This geographic area definition of community is well-suited to Perry Memorial Hospital, a designated critical access hospital providing primary care through inpatient/outpatient care, ancillary services, clinics and specialty clinics to residents of a rural area. The Perry Memorial Hospital service community is located primarily in Bureau County. Major medical centers in Peoria and Rockford receive patients from the service area. Perry Memorial Hospital is a designated critical access hospital providing basic, primary care through inpatient care, ancillary services, clinics and specialty clinics to residents of a rural area.Illustration 1. Perry Memorial Hospital Service Area (ESRI - 2012) Community Health Needs AssessmentPerry Memorial Hospital | 6Demographic Profile The race and ethnicity makeup of the service area indicates that more than five percent of the population is of Hispanic origin. Other race and ethnicity numbers are typical of rural Illinois. There are no large changes in the profile projected over the next five years. The broad demographic profile of the Perry Memorial Hospital service area was determined from data reported by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI). The following chart and data profile trends in the demographic environment surrounding the Perry Memorial Hospital service area. The overall population of the service area is trending toward little change with expected related trends in most demographic categories. The median age is projected to continue to increase over the next five years to 43.7 years of age.Table 1. Population by Race - Perry Memorial Hospital Service Area Table 2.

This pattern is typical of rural Illinois. Economic Profile Median household income for 2011 was $40,923 in the Perry Memorial Hospital service area, compared to $54,442 for all U.S. households. The median household income in Illinois was $50,761 for 2011. Median household income is projected to be $48,057 in five years. Median household income is the amount where one-half of the households in an identified area have a higher income and one-half of the households have a lower income. (ESRI, 2012) Median home value in the area is $95,406, compared to a median home value of $157,913 for the U.S. In five years, median value is projected to increase to $108,181. (ESRI, 2012)Table 3. Population Age Trends - $40,923 Household Income $53,355 $59,388 Per Capita Income $22,412 $24,990Table 4. Household Income Profile - Perry Memorial Hospital Service Area (ESRI - 2012) Community Health Needs AssessmentPerry Memorial Hospital | 8According to the Illinois Department of Employment Security, Local Employment Dynamics data, 367 new jobs were created in Bureau County during the first quarter of 2011. The average over Q1-2011 and the prior three quarters was 620. That is the most recent data reported for the county. The average net job flow (jobs created - jobs lost) for the same period was a loss of 19 jobs. (IDES, May 2012) Bureau County's annual average unemployment rate for 2011 was 10.4%, compared to 9.8% for Illinois and 8.9% for the U.S. In April 2012, the monthly rate was 8.6%, compared to 8.6% for Illinois and 7.7% for the U.S. (IDES, May, 2012) Princeton Sheffield of Revenue, 2012) Sales tax revenues in the PMH service area are recovering from a general economic downturn that occurred in fiscal year 2010. In 2011, the educational attainment of the population aged 25 years or older in the area was distributed as follows: 12.4 percent had not earned a high school diploma (14.8% in the U.S.) 40.2 percent were high school graduates only (29.6% in the U.S.) 8.7 percent had completed an Associate's degree (7.7% in the U.S.) 11.6 percent had a Bachelor's degree (17.7 % in the U.S.) 5.9 percent earned a Master's/Professional/Doctorate degree (10.4% in U.S.) The percent of post high school attainment in the service area is higher than for the United States overall for associate's degrees and lower than for the United States overall in the categories of bachelor's degrees and graduate or professional degrees. Low-income students are pupils age 3 to 17, inclusive, from families receiving public aid, living in institutions for neglected or delinquent children, being supported in foster homes with public funds or eligible to receive free or reduced-price lunches. The percentage of low-income students is the count of low-income students, divided by the total fall enrollment, multiplied by 100. (American Communities Survey - 2009 estimates, 2011)Table 5. Collected Sales Tax Trends - Perry Memorial Hospital Service Area (ESRI - 2012) Table 6. Educational Attainment for Persons over Age 25 - PMH Service AreaCommunity Health Needs AssessmentPerry Memorial Hospital | 9The majority of the PMH service area is included in nine public school districts reflecting the following levels of low income students: Percent Low-Income Students District 2000 2011 Bureau V alley CUSD 340 25.4 41.4 Malden CCSD 84 14.0 34.9 Ohio CCSD 17 6.6 36.0 Ohio CHSD 5 7.0 38.2 Princeton ESD 115 19.8 39.4 Princeton HSD 500 11.4 27.8 Kewanee CUSD 5 27.8 38.6 (ESRI - 2012) The population of low income students in the state of Illinois went from 36.7% in 2000 to 48.1% low income students in 2011. The Perry Memorial Hospital service area is experiencing recovering employment numbers and sales tax revenue overall and numbers of children eligible for free or reduced lunch, which are increasing but remain generally similar when compared to many rural districts, and which are below the statewide trend. The service area is in a similar economic position to many rural communities in Illinois today. Analysis of the 2010 U.S. Census data discloses an area roughly contiguous with the zip code for Kewanee that has a concentration of population below poverty level and a population of adults without high school diplomas which exceeds 20% in both categories. There is also an area immediately south of Kewanee extending into northern Stark County that has a population below the poverty level exceeding 20%. Finally, there are census blocks on the eastern edge of the service area in Bureau and Putnam counties (extending from between and including Malden and Arlington to just north of the Village of Putnam) that exceeds the 20% level for adults without high school diplomas. A high percentage of persons below the poverty level and/or adults without high school diplomas are potential indicators of concentrations of underinsured and uninsured populations. In this case, the population concentrations of possible concern are in locations where service areas of other hospitals overlap that of PMH and suggest that cooperative planning with those hospitals may be appropriate to address the potential needs while sharing the impact of serving them.Community Health Needs AssessmentPerry Memorial Hospital | 10The service area enjoys diverse employment opportunities overall. The third largest employment group is health care and social assistance. Perry Memorial Hospital and its supporting services and partners are included in this group. PMH plays an important role in the economic vitality of the area as well as its health. The service area's social and economic picture is influenced by the fact that 86% of the land area in Bureau County consists of farms, according to 2007 data from the USDA. Thirty-four percent of local farm operators work off-farm. (Atlas of Rural and Small Town America, 2011) The Perry Memorial Hospital catchment area is marked by small communities relying primarily on small businesses and industries, agriculture and service providers for its local employment. The demographic/economic profile of the Perry Memorial Hospital service area is typical of many rural midwest communities. In the near term, the profile is expected to remain substantially similar in most categories reviewed for this assessment. This knowledge provides context for planning for the specific health needs identified in the following sections of this assessment.

Employment by Industry - Perry Memorial Hospital Service Area (ESRI - 2012) Community Health Needs AssessmentPerry Memorial Hospital | 11INPUT Health Profiles from Existing Studies and other Secondary Data The County Health Rankings rank the health of nearly every county in the nation and show that much of what affects health occurs outside of the doctor's office. The County Health Rankings confirm the critical role that factors such as education, jobs, income and environment play in how healthy people are and how long they live. Published by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Rankings help counties understand what influences how healthy residents are and how long they will live. The Rankings look at a variety of measures that affect health such as the rate of people dying before age 75, high school graduation rates, access to healthier foods, air pollution levels, income and rates of smoking, obesity and teen births. The Rankings, based on the latest data publicly available for each county, are unique in their ability to measure the overall health of each county in all 50 states on the multiple factors that influence health. (County Health Rankings and Roadmaps, 2012) Bureau County is ranked 25th out of the 102 Illinois counties in the Rankings released in April 2012. The following observations from the Rankings are of interest to the health needs assessments of the PMH service area. The County Health rankings also show a motor vehicle crash death rate of 24 (per 100,000 population) in Bureau County, compared to a rate of 11 statewide. The Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System provides health data trends through the Illinois Department of Public Health in cooperation with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Office of Surveillance, Epidemiology and Laboratory Services.

Those secondary sources included: Kaiser State Health Facts - The Kaiser Family Foundation Illinois County Health Rankings - Robert Woods Foundation State Cancer Profiles - The National Cancer Institute Community Health Status Indicators - U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Illinois Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (IBRFSS), which pro-vides health data trends through the Illinois Department of Public Health in cooperation with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Office of Surveillance, Epidemiology and Laboratory Services, and the Bureau County IPLAN. (Illinois Project for Local Assessment of Needs - Illinois Department of Public Health) County Health Rankings The following table reflects longitudinal information from the IBRFSS that indicate areas of likely health care needs. Since 2003, reports of diagnosis of high blood pressure have risen slowly to exceed the state level, and reports of diagnosis of arthritis and persons at-risk for acute or binge drinking and using tobacco have varied while generally exceeding the state level. The State Cancer Profiles compiled by the National Cancer Institute list Bureau, Henry and Marshall counties at Priority Level 6 for all cancers, which means that the cancer rate overall is similar to the U.S. rate and is stable over the recent past.

Nephritis and related kidney conditions also account for a significant number of deaths in the county. The state cancer profiles compiled by the National Cancer Institute list Bureau County at Priority Level 6 for all cancers, which means that the cancer rate overall is similar to the U.S. rate and is stable over the recent past. A recent study of 13 counties in northwestern Illinois by the University of Illinois College of Medicine determined that the prevalence of Multiple Sclerosis in Bureau County of 68.7 cases per 100,000 population was lower than the national rate of 100 per 100,000 population. However, the rate for the PMH service area community of Tiskilwa (213.4 cases per 100,000 population) was well above the national rate and among the 10 highest rates in individual zip codes in the study. ( Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Prevalence in Thirteen Northwest Illinois Counties. University of Illinois, College of Medicine, Joel B. Cowen, Principal Investigator (2009)) Bureau County is a designated health professional shortage area for mental health, low income dental services and low income primary medical care, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration. The Bureau-Putnam Health Department overlaps most of the PMH service area. Table 10. Incidence by Disease Type - Bureau CountyCommunity Health Needs AssessmentPerry Memorial Hospital | 14IPLAN The Bureau & Putnam County Health Department (BPHD) works actively with hospitals and other health care providers in Bureau and Putnam counties, including Perry Memorial Hospital and many of its partners. The service area of the BPHD overlaps a large portion of the area served by Perry Memorial Hospital, but they are not contiguous. The BPHD conducts a community health planning process under the Illinois Project for Local Assessment of Needs (IPLAN) every five years. Every health department in Illinois develops a local IPLAN. The 2012-2016 Bureau & Putnam County IPLAN was released in July 2012. Through a process involving surveying and meeting with community stakeholders informed by secondary data from various sources, four health problems were prioritized for the two counties and plans were developed to address them. The identified problems are: Substance abuse Nutrition, physical activity and obesity Access to care Mental health In detailed discussion of these problems, the IPLAN highlighted reducing substance abuse among youth and binge drinking among adults (pp. 10-17), reducing obesity, increasing intake of nutritional foods and increasing physical activity levels of all ages (pp. 18-24), increasing capacity and knowlege about the health care system (p. 28) and increasing the number of good mental health days and decreasing depression (p. 34). Synthesized Secondary Data The population and economic demographics for Perry Memorial Hospital's service area are similar to other rural areas of Illinois in most categories. Bureau County reports a higher percent of population diagnosed with arthritis, high blood pressure and reporting obesity than state averages. Diseases of the heart and cancer are the two leading causes of death by a wide margin. Although cancer, in all forms is a leading cause of death, the cancer rate has been reported to be stable over recent years. Death from motor vehicle crashes is reported as being over two times the statewide rate. Summary The secondary data and previous planning conclusions draw attention to several common issues of rural demographics and economies of the day and draw emphasis to issues related to mental health, education and risky behavior with regard to alcohol, obesity, smoking and related issues.Community Health Needs AssessmentPerry Memorial Hospital | 15Primary Source Information Focus Group #1 - Community Leaders and Groups A focus group comprised of community leaders and group representatives met on March 5, 2012. The group included representatives of local Rotary and Lions clubs, a Chamber of Commerce executive and an administrator of a nursing home. The focus group session opened with the identification of several positive events that took place within the Perry Memorial Hospital service area during the past five years. The following developments were cited: Urgent care Renovations at PMH Expansion of transportation services (up to 65 miles) Ambulance/EMT services at Princeton Fire Department Hospital recruiting experienced staff Obstetrics has improved Dr. Sompalli (orthopedic surgeon) Quality assurance program Transition follow-up The group then discussed a wide variety of health needs and health-related concerns in several general categories, including: Coordinated women's health - medical Wound care onearest services are in Sterling or Peoria Oncology treatment Psychiatric omental illness, including depression omedication compliance oclosest care is Ottawa, Morris, Peoria - no psychiatrist here oNorth Central Behavioral Health Systems (NCBHS) - counseling Pediatric psychiatric Speech therapy Hepatitis - B and C Upper respiratory and pneumonia Suicide Cancer oall kinds of cancer oseems like there is a lot of urinary tract and colon cancer Education about cancer and testing Homelessness Alcohol Substance abuse omethamphetamines oheroin osyntheticsCommunity Health Needs AssessmentPerry Memorial Hospital | 16 oprescriptions abuse resale theft Hearing testing Nutrition oeducation oparents' groups and schools try to provide healthy lunch Focus Group #2 - Official and Community Leaders A focus group comprised of community leaders and elected officials met on March 7, 2012.

The group first discussed positive developments in the Perry Memorial Hospital service area in the recent past. They identified the following changes: Initiation of palliative care bridging Expansion of rural transport Administration at hospital Improved interoperability PMH growth in collaboration Emergency response collaboration The group then discussed a wide variety of health needs and concerns in several general categories, including: Educating low income parents on how to find services Services for low income, underinsured and uninsured Education about farm exposure to carcinogens, etc. More information about MS Sheffield nuclear site remains a concern Mental health odepression osuicide oyouth osubstances heroin synthetics marijuana methamphetamines prescriptions abuse access by children and others Bullying Allocate overflow in emergency room to accommodate ambulance and true emergencyCommunity Health Needs AssessmentPerry Memorial Hospital | 19 Weekend care - Prompt Care Maintain and plan to maintain levels of emergency care in face of new regulations Obesity oheart disease odiabetes Alzheimer's Scabies, MRSA Cancer oyounger (farm exposure) obreast obladder oovarian oleukemia (rare forms due to farm exposure) oesophageal Norovirus in nursing homes and schoolsCommunity Health Needs AssessmentPerry Memorial Hospital | 20PRIORITIZATION Reconciliation of Primary Source Information with Secondary Data The facilitated primary information gathering process resulted in the discovery of issues subsequently prioritized during discussion by participants and repetition among groups to a list of concerns largely common to the overarching categories of delivery of mental health services, prevention of substance abuse, issues falling under wellness education, access to services for all residents and planning for securing and maintaining local availability of medical specialists. The areas chosen were consistent with the needs identified from the secondary information collected and observed. One focus group mentioned a high level of perceived cases of multiple sclerosis in the service area. As noted, previously in this report, a recent study of 13 counties in northwestern Illinois by the University of Illinois College of Medicine determined that the prevalence of Multiple Sclerosis in Bureau County of 68.7 cases per 100,000 population was lower than the national rate of 100 per 100,000 population. However, the rate for the PMH service area community of Tiskilwa (213.4 cases per 100,000 population) was well above the national rate and among the 10 highest rates in individual zip codes in the study. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Prevalence in Thirteen Northwest Illinois Counties. University of Illinois, College of Medicine, Joel B. Cowen, Principal Investigator (2009) Countywide secondary data for Bureau County for 2007 from the National Cancer Institute suggests cancer levels are stable in the service area, although mortality tables indicate it is the second most common cause of death, and the primary information gathering process resulted in discussion of concerns over several forms of cancer. The 2012-2016 Bureau & Putnam County IPLAN prioritized four community health problems: Substance abuse Nutrition, physical activity and obesity Access to care Mental healthCommunity Health Needs AssessmentPerry Memorial Hospital | 21Summary of Findings and Recommendations The items set forth below are those which found consistent identification and, ultimately, prioritization in the primary information gathering process and which are supported by the secondary information related to demographics and health status. Mental Health Services Gaps in access to mental health services at virtually all levels were identified in all the focus groups and supported by secondary data. Many of the identified issues involve health delivery and community partners outside the control of PMH but providing opportunities for external partnerships and cooperative planning for resolution. Related issues concerning substance abuse were also identified in each group and supported by the secondary data. These issues also provide the opportunity for external collaboration. Wellness education and basic wellness services for all ages This was identified as a need for better availability of information on wellness education, basic wellness care opportunities for the community in general and also improved information to the community that explains services and options for the underinsured and uninsured. Primary and secondary inquiries emphasized the need to address the issues of obesity, smoking and healthy living. Planning for continued local availability of physicians and medical specialists While there was general satisfaction expressed with currently availability of local and regional physicians and specialists, there was discussion of the need for succession planning for the primary care medical community and identification of specific specialists that are not available locally; although those specialties are available in Peoria and/or Rockford.Community Health Needs AssessmentPerry Memorial Hospital | 22RESOURCE INVENTORY Perry Memorial Hospital Perry Memorial Hospital is a critical access hospital delivering a wide range of services to its communities.
