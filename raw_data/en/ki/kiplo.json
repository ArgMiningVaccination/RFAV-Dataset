Chiropractic is a type of health care that works with the nervous system as well as the musculoskeletal system. Doctors of chiropractic are trained to diagnose and treat injuries and disorders that involve the nervous system, muscles and bones. Chiropractors in Oconto WI work directly with the spine to remove any interference that may be preventing the body to heal itself and to restore natural processes within the body. Most people think that a chiropractor pops, cracks or snaps back pain away, but there is so much more to the profession. In 1895 the first chiropractic adjustment was delivered to a man that had lost the ability to hear in one of his ears. Following an adjustment to his spine the man explained that his hearing had been restored. While this is not the most common result of chiropractic care it is an example of one of the many conditions chiropractic care has helped over the last century. new patient special Are you new to our office?
