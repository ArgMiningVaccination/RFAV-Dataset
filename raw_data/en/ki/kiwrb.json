There are many ways in which your body naturally clears metabolic waste and toxins. The liver is commonly known as the body's master detoxifier - and many of our \"Detox\" herbs do support healthy liver function, protecting the liver from damage and even promoting its regeneration where damage may have occurred. But the body also processes and eliminates toxins via the digestive system more widely, the kidneys, the lungs, the lymphatic system and the skin. It is important to provide holistic support to all of these key systems when supporting better detoxification in the body - so that we do not end up over-burdening any of them in the process. Our [360\u00b0 Detox Mix](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/360-detox-mix)for example is a powder that gently stimulates and supports the digestive system, the liver and the lymphatic and urinary systems. It enhances the function of all of these interconnected systems and effectively promotes the elimination of toxins and metabolic waste. It is perfect for a two-week cleanse and easy to incorporate into your daily routine. We also carry the same formula in plant-based capsules in our [Detox Supplements,](https://www.zenmaitri.com/collections/detox/products/detox-supplements)as another handy way to integrate the potency of the blend into your day-to-day without any concerns about taste. Our deep and mildly bitter [Detox Tea](https://www.zenmaitri.com/collections/detox/products/detox-tea)contains a similar blend that can be enjoyed as an infusion (another benefit in itself, as increasing fluid intake is also key to supporting better natural detoxification), to enhance liver function, support the lymphatic system, promote healthy digestion and replenish the system with vitamins and minerals. Unfortunately, over the past couple of centuries and especially since the second half of the XXth century, changes in Western societies have significantly increased our exposure to toxins - from synthetic pesticides, fertilisers and pesticides in our food to endocrine disruptors in the household and skincare products we use, to microplastics in our bloodstream as a result of growing plastic pollution... Our high-stress lifestyles also lead to an increase in the production of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which set off a \"fight and flight\" response. Excess hormones in the body need to be metabolised by the liver, which also has a central role in processing and eliminating toxins and metabolic waste from the body more generally. When we are busy our diets may also not provide the levels of vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids and antioxidants that we would need to keep our body's systems thriving. In this context, from time to time (and particularly around the end of the winter and beginning of spring), we can all benefit from a little support in stimulating the body's natural channels of elimination. For best results, any herbal \"detox\" support should of course also be done alongside adopting a healthy diet including a colourful range of leafy greens, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, drinking plenty of fluids, doing some physical exercise, having restful sleep and easing stress levels, for example with support from meditation and breathwork exercises. Alongside these changes, herbs can be very supportive allies.

Our [360\u00b0 Detox Mix](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/360-detox-mix)for example supports liver function and protects the liver from damage from toxins; it improves digestion, regulates the gut flora and soothes the stomach and digestive tract; it stimulates kidney function, helping to relieve fluid retention and enhance the excretion of toxins in the urine; it supports the lymphatic system's cleansing and immune work, and it also nourishes the body with a range of vitamins and minerals.

Our [Urinary Support Tea](https://www.zenmaitri.com/collections/detox/products/urinary-support-tea)is designed to help the body deal with infections, inflammation and irritation in the urinary tract or bladder, also known as cystitis. This blend contains a range of gentle but powerful herbs that act to soothe irritation and inflammation, tackle infections, support your body's natural immune response, and increase urine flow to promote toxin elimination. It contains the following herbs: - Bearberry: A urinary antiseptic, bearberry supports the body in healing and soothing infections, irritation and inflammation in the urinary tract and bladder. Its antimicrobial, cleansing and astringent (skin toning) properties make it particularly useful in aiding the healing urinary tract infections and soothing the urinary tract. - Corn silk: Corn silk, the smooth, creamy-yellow strands inside the husks of corn (ideally harvested before pollination) is rich in nutrients and is a wonderfully soothing remedy for the urinary system. It is powerfully anti-inflammatory and soothes acute and chronic inflammatory conditions of the bladder and kidneys. It also reduces fluid retention and aids the elimination of toxins via the kidneys. - Buchu: Another diuretic and urinary antiseptic, buchu is excellent for soothing urinary tract infections. It improves circulation to the urinary system and has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It eases acute and chronic inflammation in the urinary system. High in B vitamins, it reduces water retention and eases the flow of urine. - Horsetail: High in silica, selenium and zinc, horsetail is a potent 'remineraliser'. It preserves the elasticity of connective tissues and supports the elimination of metabolic waste from the body, especially through urine. It gently tones the tissues of the urinary system, and can help with urinary incontinence and bedwetting in children. It is used to soothe inflammation in the bladder, urethra and prostate. As a diuretic (which means that it increases urine output and enhances elimination of waste products via the urine), horsetail can also support the body in preventing the formation and recurrence of kidney stones. - Echinacea: Echinacea is a well-researched immune-boosting and cleansing herb. It is recommended to help with overgrowth of unfriendly microorganisms \u2014 whether in the bladder in cystitis, or in the gut. It supports the action of the immune system and is helpful to treat any gynaecological infections, pelvic inflammatory diseases, urinary infections and post-partum infections. - Marshmallow leaf: Marshmallow leaf is rich in a moistening substance called mucilage, which makes it incredibly soothing and very effective to cool irritation and inflammation. It is ideal to nourish and protect mucous membranes along the urinary system. It is a very soothing diuretic, so it helps ease infections, irritation or inflammation in the bladder and urinary tract. Our body has natural ways of processing and eliminating toxins and metabolic waste - to help it to \"detox\", there are herbs that you can take to help these natural systems to function in a healthy way. For best results, any herbal \"detox\" support should of course also be done alongside adopting a healthy diet including a colourful range of leafy greens, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, drinking plenty of fluids, doing some physical exercise, having restful sleep and easing stress levels, for example with support from meditation and breathwork exercises.

The skin is one of the body's pathways of elimination - and it may become overburdened if the body's other systems of elimination are not performing optimally, including the liver, the kidneys and the bowels. To support skin health, it is therefore important to support these other systems, for instance through herbal support (see for example our [360\u00b0 Detox Mix,](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/360-detox-mix)our [Detox Supplements](https://www.zenmaitri.com/collections/detox/products/detox-supplements)or our [Detox Tea](https://www.zenmaitri.com/collections/detox/products/detox-tea)). It is also key to eat a well-balanced, healthy diet with plenty of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals from fresh (and if possible organic) vegetables and fruits, as well as essential fatty acids from nuts and seeds (particularly omega-3 from flax seeds, chia seeds or oily fish for example). We would also recommend carefully choosing any products you apply on your skin, and going for options that are entirely natural, such as those in our Skincare Collection.

There are many herbs that can support your body's natural detoxification work - including all of the ones in our [360\u00b0 Detox Powder Mix:](https://www.zenmaitri.com/products/360-detox-mix) - Milk thistle. Milk thistle seeds have highly supportive, protective and even regenerative effects on the liver. Extensive scientific evidence has accumulated over recent decades demonstrating these properties. Milk thistle supports liver function, prevents damage from toxins and even helps restore liver tissue, including in serious scenarios (always under medical supervision in such cases, of course). It increases the resilience of liver cells by preventing toxins from entering the liver, and by stimulating the repair of cells damaged by infection, alcohol, chemical exposure and drugs, such as chemotherapy. - Burdock. Burdock is cleansing, detoxifying, antiseptic and digestive - a perfect addition to a detox mix. It has a mild laxative effect, and with its natural antimicrobial actions, it helps to clear toxins from the gut and regulate the gut flora. It promotes the detoxifying work of the liver and helps balance blood sugar levels. Its moistening fibres absorb toxins from the gut and support their elimination from the bowel. Burdock also acts as a mild diuretic, aiding the elimination of toxins via the urine. - Liquorice. Liquorice gently supports digestion and soothes the stomach and digestive tract, lowering any acidity and relieving heartburn and indigestion. It is a mild laxative. It also increases bile flow from the liver, lowers cholesterol levels and protects the liver from damage from toxins and infection. It is also a strengthening tonic - by supporting the adrenal glands, it improves resistance to physical and mental stress and helps address nervous exhaustion and fatigue. - Nettle leaf. Nettle leaves are highly nutritious - they are rich in vitamins A and C and minerals, particularly iron, calcium, silica and potassium. Nettle protects the gut lining from irritation and infection, stimulates liver and kidney function, relieves fluid retention and enhances the excretion of toxins in the urine. It has a well-rounded action to support natural detoxification processes, including benefits to digestion, liver function and kidney function. It also reduces blood sugar levels and is anti-inflammatory. It assists with clearing the skin in eczema, psoriasis, acne, urticaria and other chronic skin problems. - Cleavers. A gently detoxifying and vivifying spring tonic, cleavers provides excellent support to the lymphatic system, aiding the body in its cleansing and immune work and purifying the blood. As a diuretic, it also enhances the elimination of fluid toxins via the kidneys. It clears heat and resolves inflammation. It also gently supports digestion and liver function, although the main focus of its action is on the lymphatic system. - Marshmallow root. Marshmallow root is a powerfully soothing medicine, cooling any irritation and inflammation. It is a mild expectorant and immune enhancer, helping to clear catarrh and modulating inflammation. It is excellent for treating inflammatory gut problems, for soothing heartburn, constipation from dryness and the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. It is also a soothing diuretic. - Barberry. A very cleansing herb, barberry has been traditionally used for infections, liver and stomach ailments, and as a general tonic during convalescence. It helps maintain normal gut flora, supports digestion and decreases inflammation. It stimulates bile flow from the liver and helps support "}
