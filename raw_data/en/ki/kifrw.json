A: We formulate our lip balm with real vanilla bean and those black spots are from the vanilla! Q: Why is my lip balm grainy? A: Our lip balm can feel grainy if it has melted a bit and re-hardened, and it may feel grainy from the vanilla bean. Nothing is wrong with it or its effectiveness. It is a natural product that doesn't have binders or fillers in it, so the texture is different than a normal lip balm. Q: How can I prevent my lip balm from melting? A: If you want to take your lip balm on the go, we suggest storing it in a cooler to keep it from melting. If you have it at home, keep it in a cool area, not tucked in a pocket or some place warm.
