Traditional Chinese medicine has been practised in China for more than 2,000 years. It offers an alternative approach to the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses. According to TCM philosophy, disease is due to internal and external imbalances and diagnosis is made through observation of the tongue, pulse readings, listening, questioning and palpation. Where can I study it? The five-year full-time undergraduate degree has been running at Middlesex University for six years, with the first cohort of students graduating in the summer. Who studies Chinese medicine? Students enrolled on the programme come from a variety of backgrounds. Some enter direct from school following A-levels, while others have qualifications in different areas of complementary and alternative medicine. The youngest student enrolled is 18, the oldest is 62. One visually impaired student successfully completed the course. Is there a practical aspect to the course? There is. The highlight for most students is the compulsory five-month hospital internship in Beijing in their final year. Students get the chance to see how Chinese medicine is delivered in the Far East, as taught in Chinese medical schools. Upon return, students undertake a final clinical placement. What will I study? It's a rigorous programme. Areas studied can be divided into three broad categories, as highlighted in the House of Lords select committee report on complementary and alternative medicine. These are Chinese medicine (Chinese herbal medicine with acupuncture and moxibustion), allopathic sciences and medicine and evidence-based practice with research. Underpinning the course are modules in the history and philosophy of Chinese medicine. As science is taught across the whole programme, some prior knowledge or experience in biology/human biology will normally be expected. The human sciences taught during the first year will bring all students to the same level to progress through the following years. During the second, third and fourth years, students will have the chance to develop their clinical skills at the Asante Academy of Chinese Medicine associated with the university. To prepare students for their studies in Beijing, Mandarin lessons are taught. What type of job will I get when I graduate? Students will graduate with a BSc (Hons) in traditional Chinese medicine, and their studies will be recognised by the state administration of traditional Chinese medicine in China. Graduates have found employment in clinical practice within Chinese herbal medicine clinics, others have set up their own business, or have gone on to postgraduate medical courses. A couple have returned to Beijing to undertake further study. \u00b7 Paul Lowe is curriculum leader of complementary medicine at Middlesex University. Contact him on 0208 "}
