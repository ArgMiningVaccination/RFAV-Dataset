Again, neglecting the kinetic and potential energy and the shaft work: and using the assumptions of constant density, volume and heat capacity, we find or but is a constant, so and we also have the relationship for heat transfer from the jacket to the tank substituting the expression for Q into the tank and jacket energy balances yields the two modeling equations for this system "}
