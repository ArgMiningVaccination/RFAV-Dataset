SINO -EUPerMed hasbeen granted forfunding Framework Programme forResearch Innovation 'Horizon 2020' under grant agreement no 874556 Stakeholders' Workshop | 17 February 2022 |Alliance between personalized medicine and acupunctureDefinitions Personalised medicine : Comprehensive approach tothe prevention, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of disease based on individual genetic, epigenetic characteristics, lifestyles and environmental conditions . Acupuncture Global approach tothe person inthe prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, analysing thephysiological characteristics, thelifestyles mind inrelationship with theworld around him/her .Diagnosis Personalized medicine studies the set of genes (genomics), transcripts (transcriptomics ),proteins (proteomics) and metabolites . Acupuncture studies the person using the personal physiological and pathological anamnesis, also investigating the psychic part, the lifestyles and theway ofreacting toexternal stimuli .The objective examination with the observation ofthe body, tongue and evaluation ofthe wrists defines the syndrome, the severity ofthe disease and the itspossible evolution ofthe same allowing also atreatment, the number ofpatients treated unnecessarily toimprove the'constitutional terrain' .Possible collaborations The association between acupuncture and precision medicine could clarify the relationship between thesymptom onset, biological mechanisms that determine itand thefunction oftheacupuncture point . For example, inprecision oncology, patients with the same type ofcancer , the same mutation, and who are similar toeach other , may have different results interms of effectiveness ofanticancer treatment, side effects oftherapy, quality oflife. Acupuncture could preventively detect the possible onset ofside effects and reduce them, also through the choice ofspecific points related tothe \"omics\" profile ofthe person and his/her gender .Thank you for your attention SINO -EUPerMed has been granted forfunding through thecurrent EU Framework Programme forResearch and Innovation 'Horizon 2020' under grant agreement no874556 Stakeholders' Workshop | 17 February 2022 | "}
