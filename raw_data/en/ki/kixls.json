Faustman, MD, PhD 1, Limei Wang 2, CD4+ regulatory T-cells protect autoimmunity, cancer and infections, but mecha- nisms governing Treg activity are ill-dened. We hypothesized that tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) may control Treg functions, consid- ering that TNFR2 is expressed Effects of TNFR2 monoclonal antibodies (moAbs) on Treg proliferation, signaling, phenotype, and function were studied by multiple in vitro assays using isolated fresh human CD4+ and CD25hi coexpressing T cells from >100 donors. Antibody performance was compared to standard Treg expansion methods and categorized as agonist, antagonist or neutral in activity. RESULTS: Two antibodies exclusively acted as either a TNFR2 agonist or antagonist. In vitro the newly identied of target CD8+ the agonist-treated Tregs suppressed CD8+ proliferation, whereas the antagonist had negligible effects. The two ligands also triggered different downstream intracellular Treg TNFR2 ligands can act as antagonists or agonists by exerting opposing actions in human cells regarding Treg proliferation, signaling, and target cell activity. TNFR2 has the potential for bidirectional control over Treg homeostatic functions in humans, opening new clinical opportunities for Treg expansion or suppression. L2 Contribution of Sequential and Conformational IgE-Binding Epitopes to the Protein unfolding reduces signicantly the allergenic activity of the most potent peanut allergen Ara h 2. This allergen also contains major sequential IgE-binding epitopes, especially in a flexible region comprising the post-translationally modied peptide DPYSPOH S, with a hydroxyproline (HYP). We investigated the relative contributions of sequential and conformational epitopes to the allergenic activity of Ara h 2. METHODS: Peptides overlapping the HYP-domain were synthesized with or without the prolines hydroxylated. A variant lacking the HYP-domain was generated by deletion mutagenesis. IgE reactivity of 19 peanut-allergic patients toward synthetic peptides and recombinant Ara h 2 variants was determined by IgE-binding inhibition assays and by cells sensitized with patients' IgE antibodies. The peptide encompassing the longest HYP-domain exhibited an inhibitory capacity similar to that of the full-length unfolded Ara h 2, but only when prolines were hydroxylated. Deletion of the HYP-domain did not prevent the variant to refold correctly and to display Ara h 2 conformational epitopes. The IgE-binding capacity of Ara h 2 was then recapitulated with an equimolar mixture of the deletion variant and the synthetic HYP-peptide. Surprisingly, the HYP-peptide was also able to trigger the degranulation of RBL cells as efciently as the unfolded Ara h 2, which retained an allergenic activity with most of the tested sera. CONCLUSIONS: Proline hydroxylation is critical for Ara h 2 allerge- nicity and peptides overlapping the HYP-domain, as short as 15 and 27 amino acid residues, retain an anaphylactic potential. L3 Immunocap Cellulose Displays Cross-Reactive Carbohydrate Epitopes and Can Cause False-Positive Test Results in Patients with Anti-CCD IgE Antibodies Wolfgang Hemmer, PhD 1, Stefan Wohrl, MD, MSc, FAAAAI 1, Felix Wantke, MD, FAAAAI 1, Friedrich Altmann, PhD 2;1Floridsdorf Allergy Center, Vienna, Austria, 2Department of Chemistry, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria. RATIONALE: Cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCDs) in plant and insect venom extracts are a common cause of false-positive results during in vitro allergy diagnosis. We noticed, when using the Phadia ImmunoCAP system, that some CCD-positive sera deliver multiple posi- tive results even when tested with CCD-free recombinant allergens. METHODS: ImmunoCAP IgE binding to selected recombinant allergens and to blank ImmunoCAPs (BIC) with no allergens coupled to the cellulose sponge was compared in CCD-positive sera before and after inhibition with with IgE-binding to MUXF-CCD (r 50.66) and was completely abolished by serum pre-incubation with a CCD inhibitor (n 511). Binding scores with a second lot of BIC were lower but correlated strongly with the rst lot (r 50.99). IgE-binding of seven highly and rPru p3 positive to all four components (up to 1.6 kU/l). Binding correlated strongly with antibody binding to MUXF-CCD and BIC (r 50.92) and could be completely blocked by the CCD inhibitor. Mass spectroscopic analysis conrmed the presence of MMXF glycans in unprocessed and processed cellulose. CONCLUSIONS: Cellulose used as an allergen carrier in the ImmunoCAP system contains varying traces of CCDs itself, which can cause multiple false-positive results even to non-glycosylated recombi- nant components in patients with elevated levels ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL FEBRUARY 2014AB398 Abstracts153 RNA-Binding Hur Is Required to Control Cytokine Expression in CD4+ T Cells Dr. Ulus Atasoy, MD, FAAAAI 1, Dr. Patsharaporn Techasintana 2, Dr. Joseph Magee 2, Dr. Matt Gubin 3, Mr. Joe Rowles 2;1Surgery, University of MO-Columbia, Columbia, MO, 2University of Missouri, 3Washington University. RATIONALE: During T cell activation, up to 50% of changes occur at the posttranscriptional level, which is mediated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). HuR is a stabilizing RBP which regulates mRNA target expression via AU-rich elements present in mRNA 3'UTRs. It is permissive for Th2 and Th17 differentiation. METHODS: Previously, we showed HuR regulates GATA-3, IL-4, IL-13 and other Th2 restricted transcripts, as well as IL-17. We hypothesized that HuR is required for Th2 differentiation and Th2 associated disease such as asthma. To avoid defects in T cell development, we utilized a HuR KO mouse model in which HuR is ablated in mature CD4+ T cells, using distal Lck-Cre-ROSA-HuRfl/fl. RESULTS: Activated or Th2 polarized HuR KO CD+4 T cells showed striking increases in IL-2 secretion and an inability to shu t off IL-2 expression. Thesealso micehad profound reductions in Th2 and Th17 cytok ine expression. We used the ova challenge model of airway inflammation to furt her investigate HuR KO under antigenic conditions. HuR KO mice h ad profound reductions in BAL IL-4 and IL-13, and in pulmonary cellular i nltration with suppression of neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinoph ils. The levels of cellular inltration in HuR KO mice resembled un-immunized controls. CONCLUSIONS: HuR appears to be required for Th2 and Th17 but not Th1 differentiation and cytokine production. Furthermore, HuR functions as an off switch for IL-2 expression during T cell activation. These results may have implications for understanding mechanisms of tolerance under antigen challenge as well as in allergen driven airway lung inflammation.

RATIONALE: There is considerable interest in the use of next generation sequencing to identify molecular defects in patients with primary immunodeciency. METHODS: To identify the cause of Combined Immunodeciency in 2 patients from 2 different consanguineous Qatari families who had a similar clinical and immunologic phenotype, we used whole-exome sequencing. The patients presented at an early age with fungal, viral and bacterial infections. The patients had hypogammaglobulinemia, normal numbers of B and T cells (most of which were CD45RA positive) and low numbers of NK cells. T cell proliferative responses to mitogens were normal, but were absent to antigens and anti-CD3. We looked for homozygous variants that were present in the patients but absent in controls and public databases. Additional studies included IKK b, IKB a, and phospho-IKB aimmuno- blotting, retroviral mediated reconstitution of IKK b, and cell growth in an immortalized patient B cell line. RESULTS: We found the same homozygous nonsense mutation in IKBKB (R286X) in both patients. IKK bacts as part of the IKK complex in NF- kB activation and phosphorylates the NF- kB inhibitor, IKB a. The mutation co-segregated with disease in both families. Western blotting showed absence of detectable IKK b, and retroviral mediated reconstitution with wild type IKK bcorrected cell growth and restored IKB aphosphorylation and IKB adegradation in an EBV cell line. CONCLUSION: These dataindicatethatmutated IKBKB isthe likely cause of immunodeciency in these two patients. To our knowledge, this is the rst report of combined immunodeciency caused by a mutation in IKBKB .L6 Sputum Cytokines and Adult Brasov, Romania, 2Theramed Medical Center, Romania, 3Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research, Switzerland,4Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research, Davos, Switzerland. RATIONALE: Asthma clusters can be separated according to their endotype by combining visible properties and sputum cytokines. METHODS: The Local Ethics Committee approved the study. Induced sputum sampled outside an exacerbation was processed by dialysis (D-Tube Dialyzers Midi, Novagen) NMWL). cytokines were the 27 Plex Human Cytokine Group I Bioplex (Biorad). Hierarchical cluster analysis with a wide array of variables was used. Difference between clusters was assesed by One-way Anova. RESULTS: 60 adult asthmatics, mean age 44 614 years old, 52% females were included. Three clusters were separated, signicantly different for all sputum cytokines (except RANTES and FGF-b), asthma severity (GINA), onset of asthma, ACT score, lung function (LF), AHR, exacerbation frequency, near-fatal asthma (NFA), corticosteroid-resis- tance, blood eosinophils. Cluster 1 (n 527, 67% males) had the lowest frequency of asthma exacerbations, the best LF, predominant macrophages and lymphocytes in induced and the highest sputum IL-1RA, VEGF and IL-7. Cluster 2 (n 514, 64.3% females) had the longest asthma duration, the highest AHR and frequency of asthma exacerbations, corticosteroid-resistance and NFA, the worst LF and ACT score, the highest sputum and blood eosinophilia and the highest sputum cytokines. Cluster 3 (n 519, 63.2% females), had the shortest asthma duration, the highest FeNO and total serum IgE, the highest incidence of LF decline and atopy, sputum neutrophilia and the lowest all sputum cytokines. CONCLUSION: Deep phenotyping incorporating phenotypic traits, longitudinal data and biomarkers of inflammation straties asthma into subclasses according to their biological basis. L7 Omalizumab Therapy Is Associated with Reduced Circulating Basophil Populations in Asthmatic Children Dr. David A. Hill, MD, PhD 1, Dr. Mark Siracusa, PhD 2, Kathryn Ruymann1, Dr. Elia Tait Wojno, PhD 2, Dr. David Artis, PhD 2, Dr. Jonathan M. Spergel, MD, PhD, FAAAAI 1;1The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, 2University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. RATIONALE: Basophils have been implicated in promoting the early development of TH2 cell responses in some murine models of TH2 cytokine-associated inflammation. However, the specic role of basophils in allergic asthma remains an active area of research. Recent studies in animal models and human subjects suggest that IgE may regulate the homeostasis of human basophil populations. Here, we examine basophil populations in children with severe asthma before and during therapy with the IgE directed monoclonal antibody omalizumab. METHODS: Subjects were selected based on age between 5 and 18 years, body weight and IgE level compatible with the omalizumab dosing table, and severe asthma. Asthma symptoms assessments were administered during therapy. Peripheral blood samples were obtained before and during therapy and basophil frequencies and numbers were monitored using flow cytometric techniques. RESULTS: Omalizumab therapy wasassociatedwith a signicantreduction in circulating basophil frequencies and numbers (p <0.05, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test), a nding that correlated with improved clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The observation that circulating basophils are reduced following omalizumab therapy supports a mechanistic link between IgE levels and circulating basophil populations and may provide new insights into one mechanism by which this drug improves asthma symptoms.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 133, NUMBER 2Abstracts Gastrointestinal Lactobacillus Johnsonii Dr. Kaitlyn S.

RATIONALE: We recently demonstrated that facul- tative cecal micro- biome of mice whose airways are protected against allergen and viral challenge, and that oral supplementation with this species alone can afford airway protection. Current studies are aimed at deciphering the basis for gastrointestinal L. johnsonii protection of the airways. METHODS: L. johnsonii was isolated from airway protected mice, and its genome was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The gut micro- biome composition of mice supplemented with L. johnsonii was compared to unsupplemented animals, and used in conjunction with a meta genome predic- tive tool, PICRUSt, to compare the functional of th ese communities. RESULTS: L. johnsonii preferentially localizes in the terminal ileum and cecum. While rRNA is 99% homologous to L. johnsonii NCC 533, of are identical, sug- gesting that 15% of its genome is distinct from this species. Genes relevant to colonization, survival, and inter-species competition in the gut are pre- sent. Oral supplementation of mice with L. johnsonii is associated with sig- nicant enrichment myriad of immunomodulatory functions. CONCLUSION: L. johnsonii is a crucial species of the gut microbial community that reshapes community composition and function in a manner that affords airway protection in mice. L9 IL-13/CD14 Polymorphisms and Prenatal Risk Factors That Shape Gut Microbiota Influence the Development of Atopic Dermatitis in Infancy in a Synergistic Manner: A Birth Cohort Study (COCOA) Prof. So Yeon Lee, MD, PhD 1, Prof. Hae-Ran Lee 2, Kang Mo Ahn 3, Prof. Kyung Won Kim, MD, PhD 4, Prof. Youn Ho Shin, MD, PhD 5, Gyeong-shin Lee 6, Seo Ah Hong 7, Dr. Young-Ho Ho Jung, MD 8, Dr. Eun Lee, MD 9, Song-Yi Yang 10 , Dr. MD 11 Kim, MD, PhD13,14, Dr. Hyo-Bin Kim, MD, PhD 14,15, Prof. Soo-Jong Hong, MD, PhD16 ;1Department of Pediatrics, Hallym University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea, 2Hallym University, South Korea, 3Department of Pe- diatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, South Korea, 4Department of Pediatrics, Severance Children's Hospital, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, Seoul, South Korea, 5Department of Pediatrics, CHA Medical Center, CHA University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea, 6Childhood Asthma Atopy Center, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medi- cine, South Korea, 7Research Center for Standardization of Allergic Dis- eases, Asan Institute for Life Sciences, University of ulsan College of Medicine, South Korea, 8Childhood Asthma Atopy Center, Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea, 9Childhood Asthma Atopy Center, Asan Medical Cen- ter, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, South Korea, 10 Childhood Asthma Atopy Center, Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center, Uni- versity of Ulsan College of Medicine, South Korea, 11 Department of pediat- rics, Korea Cancer Center Hospital, South Korea, 12 Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, South Korea, 13 Department of Pediatrics, Hae-undae Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine, Busan, South Korea, 14 Research Center for Standardization of Allergic Diseases, Seoul, South Korea, South Korea, 15 Department of Pediatrics, Inje University Sanggye Paik Hospital, Seoul, South Korea, 16 Department of Pedi- atrics, Asan Medical Center, Childhood Asthma Atopy Center, S outh Korea. RATIONALE: Although cesarean delivery and prenatal exposure to antibiotics are likely to affect the gut microbiome in infancy, their effect on the development of atopic dermatitis (AD) in infancy is unclear. The influence of individual genotypes on these relationships is also unclear. To evaluate with a prospective birth cohort study whether cesarean section, prenatal exposure to antibiotics, and susceptible genotypes act synergis- tically to promote the development of AD in infancy. METHODS: The study population comprised 412 infants from the Cohort for Childhood of Asthma and Allergic Diseases (COCOA). Their cord blood DNA was subjected to IL13 (rs20541) and CD14 (rs2569190) genotype analysis. Fecal samples were obtained from 11 of the 412 infants in this study at the age of 6 months and 16s rRNA bacterial gene sequencing was performed. RESULTS: The combination of cesarean delivery and prenatal exposure to antibiotics associated signicantly and positively with AD (aOR, 5.70; 95% CI, 1.19-27.3). The association between cesarean delivery and AD was signicantly modied by parental history of allergic diseases or risk- associated IL-13 (rs20541) and CD14 (rs2569190) genotypes. Infants who were exposed prenatally to antibiotics and were born by cesarean delivery had lower total microbiota diversity in stool samples at 6 months of age than the control group. As the number of these risk factors increased, the AD risk rose (trend p <0.05). CONCLUSION: Cesarean delivery and prenatal antibiotic exposure may affect thegut microbiota, whichmay inturninfluencethe risk of AD in infant s. These relationships may be shaped by the genetic susceptibility alleles. L10 The Role of Chitin and TNF-Alpha in Airway Inflammation Induced By House Dust Mite in Murine Model Prof. Sang Min Lee, MD 1, Mr. Joon Pyo Choi, PhD 2, Young Min Kim 2, Seung Jin Choi2, Hyun Taek Park 2, Prof. Sang Pyo Lee, MD, PhD 3, Prof. Sang Heon Cho, MD, PhD4,5, Prof. Yoon-Keun Kim, MD, PhD 2; 1Department of InternalMedicine,Gachon University Gil Medical Center, In- cheon, South Korea, 2Division of Molecularand Life Sciences, Department of Life Science, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, South Korea, 3Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University Gil Medical center, Incheon, South Korea, 4Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul NationalUniversity College of Medicine,Seoul, South Korea, 5Institute of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Seoul National University Medical Research Center, Seoul, South Korea. BACKGROUND: Chitin is a potent adjuvant in immune responses of Th2, Th1 and Th17. In our previous study, tumor necrosis factor - alpha (TNF- a) is a key mediator in the development of Th2 cell response to inhaled allergen s. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the role of chitin in the induction of Th1, Th2, and Th17 response, sensitizing and challenging mice intranasally with OVA and chitin in this study. We also evaluated the role of TNF- aand the size of chitin in the development of Th2 immune response induced by chitin, using TNF- a-decient mice and chitinase-treated chitin, respectively. METHODS: A mouse model was generated via simultaneous intranasal administration of 75 mg of ovalbumin (OVA) and 100 mg of house dust mite (HDM)-derived chitin in the presence or absence of chitinase. The effect of TNF-aon adaptive immune response was also evaluated using TNF- a- decient mice. RESULTS: HDM-derived chitin induced airway inflammation and increased the expression of all cytokines of Th1, Th2, and Th17 as well as the serum level of OVA-specic IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a. In the absence of TNF-aor in the presence of chitinase, the expression of Th2 cytokines and the serum level of OVA-specic IgE were alleviated, while the expression of Th1 and Th17 cytokines and the serum level of OVA-specic and IgG2a were preserved or more enhanced. CONCLUSION: HDM-derived chitin is size-dependent multifaceted immune adjuvant inducing Th1, Th2, and Th17 immune response, and TNF-aproduced by airway exposure to HDM-derived chitin is a key mediator in the development of Th2 cell response to inhaled allergens.

RATIONALE: Recent studies revealed that platelets are activated during asthma exacerbation and that depletion of platelets in a mouse model of asthma improves airway inflammation. However, the precise mechanisms of how platelets\u2014despite being devoid of a nucleus\u2014regulate allergic inflammation are not fully understood. IL-33, an IL-1 family cytokine, has attracted attention as a critical cytokine in the development of allergic diseases because of its potent ability to induce type 2 immunity and its strong genetic association with asthma. Objective: To determine whether platelets express IL-33 protein. METHODS: IL-33 protein in human platelets and a megakaryocyte cell line, MEG-01, and in bone marrow-derived mouse megakaryocytes was detected by Western blot analysis immunostaining. inhalation (100 mg/day K. et al. PNAS 2010) was compared between platelet-intact and platelet-depleted (by injection of anti-CD41 mAb)groups. RESULTS: expressed full-length IL-33 protein, which is biologically active. Cytosol, but not nuclear, fractions of MEG- 01 and mouse megakaryocytes also expressed full-length IL-33 protein. Depletion of platelets resulted in a signicant decrease in eosinophilic, but not neutrophilic, inflammation in papain-treated mouse airways. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel ndings suggest that platelets constitutively express active IL-33 protein and that activation of platelets plays a pivotal role in IL-33-dependent type II airway inflammation. Further understand- ing of the precise molecular mechanisms may lead to platelets' becoming an attractive new target in asthma treatment. L12 Targeted Resequencing Identified Damaging Rare Variants in IFNGR1 Associated with Atopic Dermatitis Complicated By Eczema Herpeticum Dr. Li Gao, MD, PhD 1, Dr. Ryan Heiser, PhD 2, Nicholas M. Rafaels 1, Lili Huang, MPH1, Joseph Potee 1, Dr. Rasika A. Mathias, ScD 1, Lisa A. Beck, MD, FAAAAI 3, Dr. Kathleen C. Barnes, PhD, FAAAAI 1, Donald Y. M. Leung, MD, PhD, FAAAAI 2;1Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, 2National Jewish Health, Denver, CO, 3Department of Dermatology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY. RATIONALE: Genetic variations in IFNGR1 gene have been reported that abrogate IFN- gsignaling leading to enhanced susceptibility to myco- bacterial infection. However, the causality of IFNGR1 variants in atopic dermatitis with eczema herpeticum (ADEH+) has not been established. Utilizing targeted resequencing, we assess the influence of rare functional variations in IFNGR1 to ADEH+ susceptibility. METHODS: We performed targeted resequencing in 122 European American (EA) ADEH+ cases and 107 ADEH- controls followed by validation genotyping for 3 rare missense variants in the entire cohort including a total of 411 EA patients (133 ADEH+, 157 ADEH- and 121 non-atopic controls (NA)). Association tests between rare variants and risk of ADEH+ was performed using SKAT-O. The IFN- ginduced CD80 expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was examined in a selected group of patients. RESULTS: We identied 18 common and 118 rare variants in IFNGR1 . Among the rare variants, 6 were missense with 3 as possibly damaging (Val14Met, Val61Ile and Tyr397Cys) including one novel variant (Tyr397Cys). The 3 damaging rare variants conferred greater risk for ADEH+ (P <0.031) when we compared 133 ADEH+ patients including 5 heterozygous carriers to 278 non-ADEH+ subjects (157 ADEH-, 121 NA). Enhanced signal was observed (P <7.48E-14) when we compared ndings to an unphenotyped control population (4300 EAs) from the Exome Sequencing Project. In functional studies conducted thus far, we observed that an 8-year-old boy carrying the Val14Met variant had a blunt- ed response to IFN- ginduced CD80 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel ndings provide evidence that functional polymorphisms in IFNGR1 contribute to ADEH+ susceptibility. Additional functional studies are underway. L13 Grass Pollen Allergoids Coupled to Mannan Are Novel Vaccines with Enhanced Capacity to be Captured By Dendritic Cells Promoting Th1 Immune Responses and High Levels of IL-10 Dr. Oscar Palomares, PhD 1, Dr. Soa Sirvent, PhD 1, Dr. Irene Soria, PhD2, Dr. Barbara Cases, PhD 3, Dr. Carmen D /C19ez, PhD4, Dr. Pedro Reche, PhD 4, PhD4, Dr. Eduardo Mart/C19nez-Naves, PhD4, Dr. Dr. Jose Luis Subiza, MD, PhD3;1Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Chemistry, Madrid, Spain, 2Hospital Cl /C19nico San Car- los, Madrid, Spain,3Inmunotek, Madrid, Spain,4Department of Immu- nology, School of Medicine, Complutense Madrid, Spain. RATIONALE: The immunogenicity and efcacy of allergen vaccines depend on the capacity of dendritic cells (DCs) to capture them and to induce proper immune responses. Herein, we compared the ability of native grass pollen extracts (N), glutaraldehyde-polymerized allergoids (P) and glutaraldehyde-polymerized allergoids coupled to mannan (PM) to be internalized by DCs and to regulate immune responses. METHODS: N, P and PM Phleum pratense pollen extracts were pro- duced. Human monocytes from buffy coats were differentiated to DCs with IL-4/GM-CSF. Allergen uptake was assessed by Co-culture experiments, real-time quantitative PCR, ELISA ELISPOT performed. Antibody levels in serum from BALB/c mice immunized with extracts, proliferation of splenocytes and cytokine production were determined. RESULTS: PM was captured by human DCs more efciently than N or P through mechanisms partially depending on receptor-mediated internali- zation. DCs stimulated with N, P and PM expressed high levels of HLA- DR, CD86 and CD83. PM-activated DCs produced higher N- or P-activated DCs. Allogeneic and allergen-specic co- cultures showed that PM-activated DCs generated T cells producing higher levels of IFN-gamma and IL-10 and lower levels of IL-5 or IL-4 than N- or P-activated DCs. Splenocytes from mice immunized with PM showed a Th1 cytokine-signature and high levels of IL-10 with higher proliferation than those from mice immunized with N or P. CONCLUSIONS: Grass pollen hypoallergenic allergoids conjugated to mannan may represent safer and more effective novel vaccines due to their enhanced immunogenicity and capacity to promote Th1 mediated T cell responses to allergens.

RATIONALE: Asthma, an airway inflammatory disease characterized by intermittent airway obstruction, affects more than 300 million people worldwide. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP2/9) mRNA and protein levels correlate with asthma pathogenesis; however, the role of MMP2/9 in asthma is not well understood, particularly because previous studies have not evaluated protease activity. We report the application of activatable cell-penetrating peptides (ACPPs), injectable probes that highlight in vivo activity, to assess protease activity in murine [OVA] + alum in saline [PBS]) and then challenged (OVA in PBS). Age-matched control mice were sensitized but not challenged. The day after the nal OVA challenge, ACPPs (cleavable and uncleavable, n 53-6 mice each) were administered intravenously 6 hr before mice were sacriced. Lungs were imaged for Cy5 fluorescence (Maestro, CRi). Lung (10 mm, Cy5 fluorescence on RESULTS: MMP2/9 activity was >2-fold higher in lungs from asthma mice than controls (p 51.8310 24). The same pattern was observed for ra- tiometric ACPPs. MMP2/9 activity localized around inflamed airways with 1.6-fold higher ACPP uptake surrounding airways compared to the normal lung parenchyma (p 50.03). MMP2/9 activity detected by ACPPs co-localized with with in situ DQ CONCLUSIONS: MMP-activated ACPPs allow for real-time detection of protease activity in a murine asthma model, improving our understand- ing of protease activation in asthma progression and elucidating novel therapy targets. L15 Asthma and Airway Hyperresponsiveness in Children with Eosinophilic Esophagitis: EGF and FGF-2 As a Link Dr. Nadia L. Krupp, MD 1, Prof. Sarita Sehra, PhD 2, Dr. Sandeep K. Gupta, MD 1, Prof. Mark H. Kaplan, PhD 1, Dr. Robert S. Tepper, MD 3; 1Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, 2Indiana University School of Medicine, 3Riley Hospital for Children, Indianapo- lis, IN. RATIONALE: Asthma is prevalent in children with eosinophilic esoph- agitis (EoE), previously estimated at 24-42% versus 9% for the general population. However, studies of pulmonary function and airway hyper- responsiveness (AHR) in children with EoE are lacking. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted of children aged 6-18 years with EoE and healthy controls. Methacholine challenge (AHR dened as provocative concentration of methacholine <8mg/ml), and exhaled nitric oxide were performed. Peripheral blood was analyzed for total IgE, eosinophil count, eotaxin, and serum cytokines. RESULTS: Baseline spirometry was and not signicantly different for EoE subjects (n 533) and healthy controls (n 537). AHR was present in 33% of children with EoE and 10.8% of healthy controls (p 50.04). 20% of EoE subjects with asthma (n 515) had AHR, versus 44% of EoE subjects without asthma (n 518). Overall, 69.7% of EoE subjects had either asthma or AHR. AHR correlated strongly with serum IgE (p <0.0001) and exhaled nitric oxide (p 50.0002). Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and broblastic growth factor 2 (FGF-2) were elevated in subjects with EoE and asthma , compared to healthy controls and those with EoE but no asthma (p <0.05). Subjects with EoE and asthma who were on asthma controller medications had similar levels of EGF and FGF-2 as healthy controls. Th 2cytokines and eotaxin did not differ signicantly among any groups. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma and AHR may be more prevalent than previously estimated in children with EoE. Serum elevations of EGF and FGF-2 were seen in EoE subjects with asthma, but not in subjects on asthma controller medications.L16 Efficacy and Safety of Lebrikizumab in Severe Uncontrolled Asthma: Results from the Lute and Verse Phase II Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials Nicola A.

RATIONALE: A subset of severe asthma patients are inadequately controlled despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a second controller. Lebrikizumab is a humanized antibody to IL-13, a key effector cytokine in asthma pathogenesis. In a previous Phase 2 trial, lebrikizumab treatment increased forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1), particularly in patients with higher blood periostin levels. METHODS: LUTE and VERSE were replicate, multicenter, double- blind studies that randomized (1:1:1:1) patients with uncontrolled asthma despite treatment with ICS and a second controller to receive lebrikizumab 37.5mg, 125mg, 250mg, or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the rate of exacerbations. Secondary endpoints included change in FEV 1. The trials, initially Phase 3, were converted to Phase 2b upon identication of a process- related impurity requiring changes to the lebrikizumab manufacturing process. RESULTS: 463 patients were pooled for analysis. The median number of doses received was 6 (range 1-12). Compared with placebo (n 5116), the exacerbation rate 125mg, and groups, respectively. At Week 12, in FEV 1were greater for lebrikizumab versus pla- cebo, particularly in periostin-high patients. No important safety signals were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Lebrikizumab treatment reduced the exacerbation rate and increased FEV 1in patients with uncontrolled asthma on ICS and a sec- ond controller, particularly those who were periostin-high, conrming the ndings from the previous Phase 2 ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL FEBRUARY 2014AB402 Abstracts157 L17 Dose-Finding Efficacy and of House Dust Mite Sublingual Immunotherapy Tablet, MK-8237, Using an Environmental Exposure Chamber Dr. Hendrik Nolte, MD, PhD 1, Dr. Jennifer Maloney, MD 1, Dr. Harold S. Nelson, MD, FAAAAI 2, Dr. David I. Bernstein, MD, FAAAAI 3, Dr. Ziliang Li, PhD 1, Rene Zieglmayer 4, Dr. Petra U. Zieglmayer, MD 4, Dr. Friedrich Horak, MD 4;1Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ,2National Jewish Health, Denver, CO, 3Bernstein Allergy Group, Cincinnati, OH, 4Vienna Challenge Chamber, Vienna, Austria. RATIONALE: Sublingual immunotherapy with house dust mite (HDM) might be benecial in patients with allergic rhinitis with/without conjunctivitis (AR/C), although reported effect size is small to moderate and varies greatly among studies. MK-8237 (Merck/ALK-Abell /C19o) is a sublingual HDM immunotherapy investigation. METHODS: In double-blind, trial adults 5124) received daily MK- 8237 12 DU, 6 DU, or placebo for 24 weeks, and underwent exposure challenges (Vienna Challenge Chamber) at weeks 8, 16, and 24. The primary objective was to evaluate the dose-related efcacy of MK-8237 versus placebo on total nasal symptom score (TNSS) during chamber challenge at week 24. TNSS was the sum of 4 nasal symptom scores (maximum 512). RESULTS: MK-8237 12 DU and 6 DU provided a 48.4% and 26.2% improvement, respectively, in TNSS at week 24 versus placebo (mean difference: 23.62, P< .001 and 21.98, P5.003). TNSS improvements were observed at weeks 8 (mean 20.3%; P5.007) and 16 (mean difference: 22.08, 30.1%; P< .001) for the 12 DU dose and week 16 (mean difference: 21.23, 17.8%; P5.032) for the 6 DU dose. Total symptom scores (nasal+ocular symptoms) were signi- cantly improved by both doses versus placebo at week 24. Both doses of MK-8237 were well tolerated, with no systemic allergic reactions or reac- tions requiring epinephrine. CONCLUSIONS: MK-8237 appears promising, with potential for high and clinically meaningful ( >20% reduction in symptoms) effect to be further evaluated in eld trials. A dose-dependent effect was observed, with the 12 DU dose exhibiting the best benet/risk ratio.

RATIONALE: OIT results sustained unresponsiveness (SU) in a subset of egg-allergic children; however, long-term treatment effects off- therapy are not established. METHODS: Egg-allergic children (5-18 y/o) received egg OIT (n 540), maximum 4 years, or placebo (n 515), maximum 1 year. Through year 4, subjects were assessed as SU (passed OFC after 4-6 weeks off OIT) or desensitized (D) (passed OFC on therapy only). SU subjects were instructed to add unbaked egg ad libitum; other subjects added egg independent of physician instruction. Long-term, follow-up questionnaires (LFQ) were administered at a median of 61.6 months from enrollment to assess unbaked (lightly cooked) vs. baked (heat-denatured) egg consump- tion in current diet and symptoms. RESULTS: Of 40 egg OIT-treated subjects, 22/40(55%) were SU by year 4 (versus 27.5% at year 2). Of 8,925 egg OIT doses in years 2-4, 95% were symptom-free. 45/55 (81.8%) subjects completed the LFQ. More egg OIT subjects [23/34(67.6%)] consumed unbaked and baked egg vs. placebo subjects [2/11(18.2%)] (p 50.006). 20/20 (100%) OIT-SU subjects were consuming all forms of egg in their diet. 7/8 (87.5%) OIT-D subjects were consuming some egg; 3 unbaked and 4 only baked egg. 1/6 (16.7%) OIT- not-desensitized subjects were consuming only baked egg. 4/11 (36.4%) placebos were consuming some egg; 2 unbaked and 2 only baked egg. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest sustainability of long-term egg consumption among subjects demonstrating SU after completion of egg OIT. Future work is needed to identify individuals who will benet from egg OIT. L19 A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Omalizumab Combined with Oral Immunotherapy (OIT) in the Treatment of Cow's Milk Allergy (CMA): Safety of Dosing Dr. Jennifer S.

RATIONALE: Determine whether the addition of omalizumab reduces dosing-related side-effects in subjects with CMA undergoing milk METHODS: Fifty-seven milk-allergic subjects PST were randomized 1:1 to receive blinded omalizumab or placebo for 16 months. Open-label milk OIT dosing was initiated after Month 4 of omalizumab/ placebo with an escalation to maintenance over 22-40 weeks; goal - 3.84 g milk protein/day. RESULTS: At enrollment, there were no statistically signicant differ- ences between the omalizumab/placebo treatment arms for (39.4 vs. 42.0 kUA/L), milk PST wheal (10.0 vs. 8.0 mm) or OFC dose at rst symptom (20 vs. 20 mg). Three subjects withdrew prior to OIT dosing. Signicant differences between the omalizumab (n 526) and placebo (n 528) groups were seen for dose-related symptoms per subject during dose escalation and maintenance therapy through 16 months (median: 5.0 vs. 47.5; p 50.0001), dosing reactions requiring treatment (median: 1.0 vs. 12.0; p 50.0003), and need for epinephrine (1 time in 1 omalizumab subject vs. 17 times in 9 placebo subjects). Signicantly fewer doses were required to achieve maintenance dosing in the omalizumab group (median: 198.0 vs. 224.5; p 50.01) resulting in a shorter escalation phase with omalizumab (25.9 vs. 30.8 weeks; p 50.01). CONCLUSIONS: This is the rst randomized, double-blinded, placebo- controlled OIT trial demonstrating that omalizumab signicantly reduces the dosing symptoms and treatment requirements, including epinephrine, of OIT-related side-effects and reduces the time to achieve maintenance dosing. Future DBPCFCs will determine whether omalizumab improves the induction rate of desensitization and tolerance.

METHODS: European trial randomized adults with moderate-to- severe atopic dermatitis poorly controlled by topical agents to 12 weekly subcutaneous doses of placebo (n 554) or dupilumab 300 mg (n 555); topical agents were not permitted. Primary efcacy endpoint was percent change in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score from baseline to week 12. Secondary endpoints included changes from baseline in EASI, body surface area, SCORAD, pruritus numerical rating scale, and 5-D Pruritus patients achieving EASI reduction >_50% (EASI-50), Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) 0 or 1, and safety were assessed. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between groups (EASI mean6SD: 23.12 612.35 on dupilumab and 24.10 612.70 on placebo). Percent change from baseline in EASI showed improvements that signicantly favored dupilumab relative Other of disease activ- ity ( P< 0.0001). Eleven SAEs were reported in the placebo group compared to 1 in the dupilumab group. Skin infections were also reported less often in dupilumab group (2[4%] vs 14[26%]). Treatment-emergent adverse pla- cebo. Frequent TEAEs reported more often with dupilumab were injection site reactions and nasopharyngitis. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, 12 weeks of dupilumab monotherapy was associated with rapid, marked improvements in measures of disease activity and pruritus, fewer SAEs, less infections compared to placebo, and was generally well-tolerated.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL FEBRUARY 2014AB404 Abstracts "}
