ZINC iii UPDATE STATEMENT A Toxicological Profile for Zinc, Draft for Public Comment was released in September 2003. This edition supersedes any previously released draft or final profile. Toxicological profiles are revised and republished as necessary. For information regarding the update status of previously released profiles, contact ATSDR at: Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Division of Toxicology/Toxicology Information Branch 1600 Clifton Road NE Mailstop F-32 Atlanta, Georgia 30333 ZINC vi *Legislative Background The toxicological profiles are developed in response to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 (Public law 99-499) which amen ded the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA or Superfund). This public law directed ATSDR to prepare toxicological profiles for hazardous substances most commonly found at facilities on the CERCLA National Priorities List and that pose the most significant potential threat to human health, as determined by ATSDR and the EPA. The availability of the revised priority list of 275 hazardous substances was announced in the Federal Register on November 17, 1997 (62 FR 61332). For prior versions of the list of substances, see Federal Register notices dated April 29, 1996 (61 FR 18744); April 17, 1987 (52 FR 12866); October 20, 1988 (53 FR 41280); October 26, 1989 (54 FR 43619); October 17, 1990 (55 FR 42067); October 17, 1991 (56 FR 52166 ); October 28, 1992 (57 FR 48801); and February 28, 1994 (59 FR 9486). Section 104(i)(3) of CERCLA, as amended, directs the Administrator of ATSDR to prepare a toxicological profile for each substance on the list. ZINC vii QUICK REFERENCE FOR HE ALTH CARE PROVIDERS Toxicological Profiles are a unique compilation of toxicological information on a given hazardous substance. Each profile reflects a comprehensive and extensive evaluation, summary, and interpretation of available toxicologic and epidemiologic information on a substance. Health care providers treating patients potentially exposed to hazardous substances wi ll find the following information helpful for fast answers to often-asked questions. Primary Chapters/Sections of Interest Chapter 1: Public Health Statement: The Public Health Statement can be a useful tool for educating patients about possible exposure to a hazardous subs tance. It explains a substance's relevant toxicologic properties in a nontechnical, question-and-answer format, and it includes a review of the general health effects observed following exposure. Chapter 2: Relevance to Public Health: The Relevance to Public Health Section evaluates, interprets, and assesses the significance of toxicity data to human health. Chapter 3: Health Effects : Specific health effects of a given hazardous compound are reported by type of health effect (death, systemic, immunologic, re productive), by route of exposure, and by length of exposure (acute, intermediate, and chronic). In addition, both human and animal studies are reported in this section. NOTE : Not all health effects reported in this sec tion are necessarily observed in the clinical setting. Please refer to the Public Health Statement to identify general health effects observed following exposure.

PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT This public health statement tells you about zinc and the effects of exposure to it. Zinc is an essential element needed by your body and is co mmonly found in nutritional supplements. However, taking too much zinc in to the body can affect your health. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identif ies the most serious hazardous waste sites in the nation. These sites are then placed on the National Priorities List (NPL ) and are targeted for long-term federal clean-up activities. Zinc has been found in at least 985 of the 1,662 current or former NPL sites. Although the total number of NPL sites evaluated for zinc is not known, the possibility exists that the number of sites at which zinc is found may increase in the future as more sites are evaluated. This information is important because these sites may be sources of exposure and exposure to zinc may harm you. When a substance is released either from a larg e area, such as an industrial plant, or from a container, such as a drum or bot tle, it enters the environment. Such a release does not always lead to exposure. You can be exposed to a s ubstance only when you come in contact with it. You may be exposed by breathing, eating, or drinking the substance, or by skin contact. If you are exposed to zinc, many factors will de termine whether you will be harmed. These factors include the dose (how much), the duration (how long) , and how you come in contact with it. You must also consider any other chemi cals you are exposed to and your age, sex, diet, family traits, lifestyle, and state of health. 1.1 WHAT IS ZINC? Zinc is one of the most common elements in the Ea rth's crust. Zinc is found in the air, soil, and water and is present in all foods. In its pure elemental (or metallic) form, zinc is a bluish-white, shiny metal. Powdered zinc is explosive and ma y burst into flames if stored in damp places. Metallic zinc has many uses in industry. A common use for zinc is to coat steel and iron as well 2 ZINC 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT as other metals to prevent rust and corrosion; this pro cess is called galvaniza tion. Metallic zinc is also mixed with other metals to form alloys such as brass an d bronze. A zinc and copper alloy is used to make pennies in the United States. Metallic zinc is also used to make dry cell batteries. Zinc can also combine with other elements, such as chlorine, oxygen, and sulfur, to form zinc compounds. Zinc compounds that may be found at hazardous waste sites ar e zinc chloride, zinc oxide, zinc sulfate, and zinc sulf ide. Most zinc ore found naturall y in the environment is in the form of zinc sulfide. Zinc compounds are widely used in industry. Zinc sulfide and zinc oxide are used to make white paints, ceramics, and other products. Zinc oxide is also used in producing rubber. Zinc compounds, such as zinc acetate, zinc chlori de, and zinc sulfate, are used in preserving wood and in manufacturing and dyeing fabrics. Zinc chlori de is also the major ingredient in smoke from smoke bombs. Zi nc compounds are used by the drug industry as ingredients in some common products, such as vitamin supplements, sun blocks, diaper rash ointments, deodorants, athlete's foot prepar ations, acne and poison ivy preparations, and antidandruff shampoos. Information can be found on the chemical and physical properties of zinc in Chapter 4 and on its occurrence and fate in the environment in Chapter 6. 1.2 WHAT HAPPENS TO ZINC WH EN IT ENTERS THE ENVIRONMENT? Zinc enters the air, water, and soil as a result of both natural processes and human activities. Most zinc enters the environment as the resu lt of mining, purifying of zinc, lead, and cadmium ores, steel production, coal burning, and burning of wastes. These activities can increase zinc levels in the atmosphere. Waste streams from zinc and other metal manufacturing and zinc chemical industries, domestic waste water, and run-off from soil contai ning zinc can discharge zinc into waterways. The level of zinc in soil increases mainly fr om disposal of zinc wastes from metal manufacturing industries and coal ash from el ectric utilities. Sludge and fertilizer also contribute to increased levels of zi nc in the soil. In air, zinc is present mostly as fine dust particles. This dust eventually settles over land and water. Rain and sn ow aid in removing zinc from air. Most of the zinc in lakes or rive rs settles on the bottom. However, a small amount may remain either dissolved in water or as fine suspended particles. The level of dissolved zinc 3 ZINC 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT in water may increase as the acidity of water increas es. Fish can collect zinc in their bodies from the water they swim in and from the food they eat. Most of the zinc in soil is bound to the soil and does not dissolve in water. However, depend ing on the type of soil, some zinc may reach groundwater, and contamination of groundwater has occurred from hazardous waste sites. Zinc may be taken up by animals eating soil or drinking water containing zinc. Zinc is also a trace mineral nutrient and as such, small amounts of zi nc are needed in all animals. For more information about what happens to zinc in the environment, see Chapter 6. 1.3 HOW MIGHT I BE EXPOSED TO ZINC? Zinc is an essential element needed by your body in small amounts. We are exposed to zinc compounds in food. The average da ily zinc intake through the diet in this country ranges from 5.2 to 16.2 milligrams (milligram=0.001 gram). Food may contain levels of zinc ranging from approximately 2 parts of zinc per million (2 ppm) parts of foods (e.g., leafy vegetables) to 29 ppm (meats, fish, poultry). Zinc is also present in most dri nking water. Drinking water or other beverages may contain high levels of zinc if they are stored in metal containers or flow through pipes that have been coated with zinc to resist rust. If you take more than the recommended daily amount of supplements contai ning zinc, you may have hi gher levels of zinc exposure. In general, levels of zinc in air are relatively lo w and fairly constant. Average levels of zinc in the air throughout the United Stat es are less than 1 microgram of zinc per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m 3) of air, but range from 0.1 to 1.7 \u00b5g/m3 in areas near cities. Air near industrial areas may have higher levels of zinc. The average zinc concentration for a 1-year period was 5 \u00b5g/m3 in one area near an i ndustrial source. In addition to background exposure that all of us experience, about 150,000 people also have a source of occupational exposure to zinc that mi ght elevate their total exposure significantly above the average background exposure. Jobs wher e people are exposed to zinc include zinc mining, smelting, and welding; manufacture of bra ss, bronze, or other zinc-containing alloys; manufacture of galvanized meta ls; and manufacture of machine pa rts, rubber, paint, linoleum, 4 ZINC 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT oilcloths, batteries, some kinds of glass and ceramics, and dyes. People at construction jobs, automobile mechanics, and painters are also exposed to zinc. For more information on exposure to zinc, see Chapter 6. 1.4 HOW CAN ZINC ENTE R AND LEAVE MY BODY? Zinc can enter the body through the digestive trac t when you eat food or drink water containing it. Zinc can also enter through your lungs if you inhale zinc dust or fumes from zinc-smelting or zinc-welding operations on your job. The amount of zinc that passes directly through the skin is relatively small. The most lik ely route of exposure near NPL waste sites is through drinking water containing a high amount of zinc. Zinc is stored throughout the body. Zinc increases in blood and bone most rapidly after exposure. Zi nc may stay in the bone for many days after exposure. Normally, zinc leaves the body in ur ine and feces. More information on how zinc enters and leaves your body can be found in Chapter 3. 1.5 HOW CAN ZINC AFFECT MY HEALTH? Scientists use many tests to protect the public from harmful effects of toxic chemicals and to find ways for treating persons who have been harmed. One way to learn whether a chemical will harm people is to determine how the body absorbs, uses, and releases the chemical. For some chemicals, animal testing may be necessary. Animal testing may also help identify heal th effects such as cancer or bi rth defects. Without laboratory animals, scientists would lose a basic method for getting information needed to make wise decisions that protect public hea lth. Scientists have the responsi bility to treat research animals with care and compassion. Scient ists must comply with strict animal care guidelines because laws today protect the welfare of research animals. Inhaling large amounts of zinc (as zinc dust or fumes from smelting or welding) can cause a specific short-term disease called metal fume feve r, which is generally reversible once exposure 5 ZINC 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT to zinc ceases. However, very little is known a bout the long-term effects of breathing zinc dust or fumes. Taking too much zinc into the body through food, wa ter, or dietary supplements can also affect health. The levels of zinc that produce adve rse health effects are much higher than the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for zi nc of 11 mg/day for men and 8 mg/day for women. If large doses of zinc (10-15 times highe r than the RDA) are taken by mouth even for a short time, stomach cramps, nausea, and vomiting ma y occur. Ingesting high levels of zinc for several months may cause anemia, damage the pa ncreas, and decrease levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Eating food containing very large amounts of zinc (1,000 times higher than the RDA) for several months caused many health effects in rats, mice, and ferrets, including anem ia and injury to the pancreas and kidney. Rats that ate very large am ounts of zinc became infertile. Rats that ate very large amounts of zinc after becoming pregna nt had smaller babies. Putting low levels of certain zinc compounds, such as zinc acetate and zinc chloride, on the skin of rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice caused skin irritation. Skin irri tation from exposure to these chemicals would probably occur in humans. EPA has determined that because of lack of information, zinc is not classifiable as to it s human carcinogenicity. Consuming too little zinc is at least as important a health problem as consuming too much zinc. Without enough zinc in the diet, people may experi ence loss of appetite, decreased sense of taste and smell, decreased immune function, slow wound hea ling, and skin sores. Too little zinc in the diet may also cause poorly developed sex orga ns and retarded growth in young men. If a pregnant woman does not get enough zinc, her babies may have birth defects. More information on the health effects linked with exposure to higher-than-normal levels of zinc is presented in Chapter 3. 6 ZINC 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT 1.6 HOW CAN ZINC AFFECT CHILDREN? This section discusses po tential health effects in humans fr om exposures during the period from conception to maturity at 18 years of age. Zinc is essential for proper growth and develo pment of young children. Mothers who did not eat enough zinc during pregnancy had a higher frequency of birth defect s and gave birth to smaller children (lower birth weight) th an mothers whose zinc levels were sufficient. Very young children who did not receive enough zinc in the diet were smaller, both in length and in body weight, than children who ate enough zinc. Some foods, such as soy-based formulas, contain high levels of phytate, which can result in a decreas ed absorption of zinc in the diet. Too much of these foods may result in effects similar to those that occur when children receive too little zinc in the diet. Little is known about whether children who eat t oo much zinc will react differently from adults who have ingested large amounts of zinc. A ch ild who accidentally drank a large amount of a caustic zinc solution was found to have damage to his mouth and stomach, and later to his pancreas, but similar effects have been seen in adults who accidentally dr ank the same solution. 1.7 HOW CAN FAMILI ES REDUCE THE RISK OF EXPOSURE TO ZINC If your doctor finds that you have been exposed to substantial amounts of zinc, ask whether your children might also have been exposed. Your doctor might need to ask your state health department to investigate. Children living near waste sites containing zinc ar e likely to be exposed to higher environmental levels of zinc through breathing, drinking contamin ated drinking water, touching soil, and eating contaminated soil. It is unlikely that a child wo uld ingest enough zinc from eating soil to cause harmful effects. However, parents should superv ise to see that children avoid eating soil and wash their hands frequently, especially before eating. Parents should consult their family 7 ZINC 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT physicians about whether (and how) hand-to-mout h behaviors in their children might be discouraged. A more complete discussion can be found in Section 3.11 of the profile. Children and adults require a certa in amount of zinc in the diet in order to remain healthy. However, overuse of some medicines or vitamin supplements containing zinc might be harmful; these medicines should always be used appropria tely. If you are accidentally exposed to large amounts of zinc, consult a physician immediately. 1.8 IS THERE A MEDICAL TEST TO DETERMINE WHETHER I HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO ZINC? Medical tests can determine whet her your body fluids contain high le vels of zinc. Samples of blood or feces can be collected in a doctor's office and sent to a laboratory that can measure zinc levels. It is easier for most laboratories to meas ure zinc in blood than in feces. The presence of high levels of zinc in the feces can mean recent high zinc exposure. High levels of zinc in the blood can mean high zinc consumption and/or high exposure. High zinc levels in blood or feces reflect the level of exposure to zi nc. Measuring zinc le vels in urine and saliva also may provide information about zinc exposure. Tests to m easure zinc in hair may provide information on long-term zinc exposure; however, no useful correl ation has been found between hair zinc levels and zinc exposure and these tests are not routinel y used. Since zinc levels can be affected by dietary deficiency and cell stress, these results may not be directly related to current zinc exposure. More information on tests to measure zinc in the body can be found in Chapter 7. 1.9 WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS HAS TH E FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MADE TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH? The federal government develops regulations a nd recommendations to pr otect public health. Regulations can be enforced by law. The EPA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the Food and Dr ug Administration (FDA) are some federal agencies that develop regulati ons for toxic substances. Recommendations provide valuable guidelines to protect public health, but cannot be enforced by law. The Agency for Toxic 8 ZINC 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) are two fe deral organizations that deve lop recommendations for toxic substances. Regulations and recommendations can be expressed as \"not-to-exceed\" levels, that is, levels of a toxic substance in air, water, soil, or food that do not exceed a critical valu e that is usually based on levels that affect animals; they are then adju sted to levels that will help protect humans. Sometimes these not-to-exceed levels differ amo ng federal organizations because they used different exposure times (an 8-hour workday or a 24-hour day), different animal studies, or other factors. Recommendations and regulations are also updated periodically as more information becomes available. For the most current information, check with the federal agency or organization that provides it. Some regulati ons and recommendations for zinc include the following: The federal government has set standards and guidelin es to protect individu als from the potential health effects of excessive zinc. EPA has stated that drinking wa ter should contain no more than 5 mg of zinc per liter of water (5 mg/L or 5 ppm) because of taste. Furthermore, any release of more than 1,000 pounds (or in some cases 5,000 pounds) of zinc or its compounds into the environment (i.e., water, soil, or air) must be reported to EPA. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) estimat es an RDA for zinc of 11 mg/day (men). Eleven mg/day is the same as 0.16 mg per kilogr am (kg) of body weight per day for an average adult male (70 kg). An RDA of 8 mg/day, or 0.1 3 mg per kg of body weight for an average adult female (60 kg), was established for women becau se they usually weigh less than men. Lower zinc intake was recommended fo r infants (2-3 mg/day) and child ren (5-9 mg/day) because of their lower average body weights. The RDA provid es a level of adequate nutritional status for most of the population. Extra dietary levels of zinc are recommended for women during pregnancy and lactation. An RDA of 11-12 mg/d ay was set for pregnant women. Women who nurse their babies need 12-13 mg/day. 9 ZINC 1. PUBLIC HEALTH STATEMENT To protect workers, OSHA has set an average legal limit of 1 mg/m3 for zinc chloride fumes and 5 mg/m3 for zinc oxide (dusts and fumes) in wo rkplace air during an 8-hour workday, 40-hour work week. This regulation means that the workroom air should contain no more than an average of 1 mg/m3 of zinc chloride over an 8-hour wo rking shift of a 40-hour work week. NIOSH similarly recommends that the level of zi nc oxide in workplace air should not exceed an average of 1 mg/m3 over a 10-hour period of a 40-hour wo rk week.

RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH 2.1 BACKGROUND AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES TO ZINC IN THE UNITED STATES Zinc is ubiquitous in the environment, constitu ting 20-200 ppm (by weight) of the Earth's crust . It is not found as elemental zinc in nature , instead being found mainly as zinc oxi de or sphalerite (ZnS). Zinc is released into the environment as the result of mining, smelting of zinc, lead, and cadmium ores, steel production, coal burning, and burning of wastes. Am bient background air concentrations of zinc are generally <1 \u00b5g/m3. Zinc is found in soils and surficial materials of the contiguous United States at concentrations between <5 and 2,900 mg/kg, with a mean of 60 mg/kg. The zinc background concentrations in surface waters are usually <0.05 mg/L , but can range from 0.002 to 50 mg/L . Zinc metal is used most commonly as a protective coati ng of other metals, such as iron and steel. Zinc is also a component of various alloys including those used for die casting as well as brass and bronze. Many zinc alloys may be found in electrical component s of household goods. Alloys containing zinc and copper are used to make U.S. one-cent coins. Zinc metal dust is widely used in paint coatings, as a catalyst, and as a reducing and precipitating ag ent in organic and analytical chemistry . Exposure of the general population to zinc is primarily by ingestion. The average daily intake of zinc from food in humans is 5.2-16.2 mg zinc/day; assuming a 70-kg average body weight, this corresponds to 0.07-0.23 mg zinc/kg/day. Zinc is widespread in commonly consumed foods, but tends to be higher in those of animal origin, particularly some sea foods. Meat products contain relatively high concentrations of zinc, whereas fruits and vegetables have relatively low concentrations. Other possible pathways for zinc exposure are water and air. Individuals involve d in galvanizing, smelting, welding, or brass foundry operations are exposed to meta llic zinc and zinc compounds. 2.2 SUMMARY OF HEALTH EFFECTS Zinc is an essential nutrient for humans and animals th at is necessary for the function of a large number of has been associated with dermatitis, anorexia, growth retardation, poor wound healing, hypogonadism with impaired reproductive capacity, ZINC 12 2. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH impaired immune function, and depressed mental function; an increased incidence of congenital malformations in infants has also been associ ated with zinc deficiency in the mothers . Zinc deficiency may also have an impact on the carcinogenesis of othe r chemicals, although the direction of the influence seems to vary with the carcinogenic agent . The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for zinc is 11 mg/day in men and 8 mg/day in women ; these correspond to approximately 0.16 mg/kg/day for men and 0.13 mg/kg/day for women. Higher RDAs are recommended for women during pregnancy and lactation (12 mg/day). The effects of inhalation exposure to zinc and zinc compounds vary somewhat with the chemical form of the zinc compound, but the majority of the effects seen will occur within the respiratory tract. Following inhalation of zinc oxide, and to a lesser extent zinc metal and many other zinc compounds, the most commonly reported effect is the development of \"metal fume fever.\" Metal fume fever is characterized by chest pain, cough, dyspnea, reduced lung volum es, nausea, chills, malaise, and leukocytosis. Symptoms generally appear a few hours after exposure, and are reversible 1-4 days following cessation of exposure. Exposure levels associated with the development of metal fume fever have not been identified, though are generally in the range of 77-600 mg zinc/m3. Acute experimental exposures of humans to lower concentrations of zinc oxide (14 mg/m3 for 8 hours or 45 mg zinc/m3 for 20 minutes) and occupational exposures to low concen trations of zinc (8-12 mg zinc/m3 for 1-3 hours and 0.034 mg zinc/m3 for 6-8 hours) did not produce symptoms of metal fume fever . In contrast, inhalation of high levels of zinc chlo ride, which is corrosive, generally results in more pronounced damage to the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract without the effects normally seen in metal fume fever. Symptoms of high-concentr ation zinc chloride exposure include dyspnea, cough, pleuritic chest pain, bilateral diffuse infiltrations , pneumothorax, and acute pneumonitis, resulting from respiratory tract irritation . In many cases, exposure levels for these effects have not been reported, as the exposures were to zinc chloride-containing smoke and were not quantified and the contribution of other components of the smoke cannot be entirely eliminated . However, one study of zinc chloride exposure estimated an exposure level of 1,955 mg zinc/m 3. Similar irritant effects of zinc chloride have been seen in animal studies of lower exposure levels (13-121 mg/m3) and longer duration (5-100 daily exposures). The effects observed after zinc chloride inhalation are likely due to the caustic nature of zinc chloride, rather than a direct action of the zinc ion. Nausea has been reported by humans exposed to high concentrations of zinc oxide fumes (300- 600 mg/m 3) and zinc chloride (~120 mg/m3) smoke , as well as following oral exposure to zinc chloride ZINC 13 2. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH and zinc sulfate . Other gastrointestinal symptoms repor ted in cases of excess zinc exposure include vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea, in several c ases with blood. In general, oral exposure levels associated with gastrointestinal effects of zinc have not been reliably reported, but the limited available data suggest that oral concentrations of 910 mg zinc/L or single-dose exposures of ~140-560 mg zinc (acute oral doses of 2-8 mg/kg/day) are sufficient to cause these effects. The noted effects are consistent with gastrointestinal irritation. It is unclear in th e majority of human studies whether the gastrointestinal effects seen following zinc inhalation were due to system ic zinc or were the result of direct contact with the gastrointestinal tract following mucociliary cl earance of inhaled zinc particles and subsequent swallowing. Following longer-term exposure to lower doses (~0.5-2 mg zinc/kg/day) of zinc compounds, the observed symptoms generally result from a decreased absorption of copper from the diet, leading to early symptoms of copper deficiency. The most noticeable manifestation of the decreased copper levels is anemia, manifesting as decreased erythrocyte number or decreased hematocrit . High-dose zinc administration has also resulted in reductions in leukocyte number and function . Some studies have also found decreases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) leve ls in humans exposed to increased levels of zinc ; however, not all studies have confirmed this observation . Long-term consumption of excess zinc may also result in decreased iron stores , although the mechanism behind this effect is not presently clear. In most cases, dermal exposure to zinc or zinc co mpounds does not result in any noticeable toxic effects. Zinc oxide is used routinely in topical applications including sunscreens and creams designed to assist in wound healing. However, dermal exposure to zinc chlo ride, and to a lesser extent other zinc salts, can result in severe skin irritancy, characterized by parakeratosis, hyperkeratosis, inflammatory changes in the epidermis superficial dermis, and acanthosis of the follicular epithelia . Available studies have not presented evidence of re productive or developmental effects in humans or animals following inhalation of zinc compounds. E ffects on reproductive or developmental end points have been noted in oral-exposure animal studies, but generally only at very high doses (>200 mg/kg/day) . Available studies of zinc-induced carcinogenic effects in humans and animals following both oral or inhalation exposure have not ade quately demonstrated an increase in cancer incidence following long- term exposure to zinc compounds. The EPA currently classifies zinc and compounds as carcinogenicity group D (not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity). ZINC 14 2. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The primary effects of zinc are the development of me tal fume fever and effects of zinc on copper status; a more detailed discussion of these end points follows. The reader is referred to Section 3.2, Discussion of Health Effects by Route of Exposure, for additional information on other health effects. Metal Fume Fever. Metal fume fever, a well-documented acu te disease induced by inhalation of metal oxides, especially zinc, impairs pulmonary function but does not usually progress to chronic lung disease. Symptoms generally appear within a few hours after acute exposure, usually with dryness of the throat and coughing . The most prominent respiratory effects of metal fume fever are substernal chest pain, cough, and dyspnea. The impairment of pulmonary function is characterized by reduced lung volumes and a decreased diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide. Leukocytosis persisting for approximately 12 hours after the fever dissipates is also a common manifestation of metal fume fever . In general, the symptoms of metal fume fever resolve within 1-4 da ys after cessation of exposure and do not lead to long-term respiratory effects. Inhalation of \"ultrafin e\" zinc oxide particles may also result in metal fume fever, as well as histologic damage and inflammation of the lung periphery . Exposure levels leading to the development of meta l fume fever have been characterized. Minimal changes in forced expiratory flow were observed 1 hour after a 15-30-minute exposure to 77 mg zinc/m 3 as zinc oxide , while at higher levels (300-600 mg/m3, from 10 minutes to 3 hours), shortness of breath, nasal passage irritation, cough, substernal chest pain, persistent rales of the lu ng base, and a decreased vital capacity have been reported . Exposure to lower levels of zinc oxide, either for acute (14 mg zinc/m3 for 8 hours or 45 mg zinc/m3 for 20 minutes) or chronic (8-12 mg zinc/m3 for 1-3 hours and 0.034 mg zinc/m3 for 6-8 hours) duration did not result in the symptoms of metal fume fever . However, analysis by bronchoalveolar lavage of volunteers exposed to zi nc oxide for up to 2 hours (mean concentration 16.4 mg zinc/m3) revealed an increase in levels of the cytoki nes TNF, IL-6 and IL-8, and increases in the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes in the BAL fluid . Thus, it appears that while the precursor events for the development of metal fu me fever begin to occur even at very low zinc concentrations, the condition itself does not appear to fully manifest until exposure levels reach much higher (>75 mg/m3) levels. Similar effects, including decreas ed ventilation, an inflammatory response, and changes in cytokine levels, have also been seen in animal studies of zinc oxide inhalation . The exact mechanism behind the development of metal fume fever is not known, but it is believed to involve an immune response to the inhaled zinc oxide . It has been suggested that the zinc oxide causes inflammation of the respiratory tract and the releas e of histamine or histamine-like substances. In response, an allergen-antibody complex is formed that may elicit an allergic reaction upon subsequent ZINC 15 2. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH exposure to the allergen. In response to the allergen -antibody complex, an anti-antibody is formed. The anti-antibody dominates with continued exposure to th e zinc oxide, thereby producing a tolerance. When the exposure is interrupted and re-exposure occurs, the allergen-antibody complex dominates, producing an allergic reaction and symptoms of metal fume fever . Effects on Copper Status. When ingested zinc levels are very high, zinc is believed to inhibit copper absorption through interaction with metallothionein at the brush border of the intestinal lumen . Both copper and zinc appear to bind to the same metallothi onein protein; however, copper has a higher affinity for metallothionein than zinc and disp laces zinc from metallothionein protein . Copper complexed with metallothionein is retained in the mucosal cell, relatively unavailable for transfer to plasma, and is excreted in the feces when the mucosal cells are sloughed off. Thus, an excess of zinc can result in a decreased availability of dietary copper, and the deve lopment of copper deficiency. This fact has been used therapeutically in the treatment of Wilson's Dis ease. Zinc supplementation is used to substantially decrease the absorption of copper from th e diet, which can aggravate the disease . Copper is incorporated into metalloenzymes i nvolved in hemoglobin formation, carbohydrate metabolism, catecholamine biosynthesis, and cross-linki ng of collagen, elastin, and hair monoamine oxidase, and dopamine -monooxygenase, function mainly to reduce molecular oxygen. Excess zinc may alter the levels or activity of these enzymes before the more severe symptoms of copper deficiency, which include anemia and leucopenia , begin to manifest. Numerous studies in humans receiving 40-50 mg supplemental zinc/day (0.68-0.83 mg cell 5'-nucleotidase, and plasma 5'-nucleotidase activities . While the results from study to study are not always consistent, the available studies of volunteers identify 40-50 mg supplemental zinc/day as the level at which subtle changes in copper- containing enzymes begin to be seen. This effect level is supported by other studies that collectively identify a no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 30 mg supplemental zinc/day for changes in copper-containing enzyme levels in adult men. Long-term administration (1-8 years) of high zinc levels (2-11.6 mg/kg/day) has caused anemia in humans . However, adequate studies of the chronic effects of lower levels of zinc on copper status in humans are not available. Decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit and the development of anemia have also been observed in animals or ally exposed to high zinc doses . ZINC 16 2. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH 2.3 MINIMAL RISK LEVELS (MRLs) Estimates of exposure levels posing minimal risk to humans (MRLs) have been made for zinc. An MRL is defined as an estimate of daily human exposure to a substance that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of adverse effects (noncarcinogenic) over a specified duration of exposure. MRLs are derived when reliable and sufficient data exist to identify the target organ(s) of effect or the most sensitive health effect(s) for a specific duration within a given route of exposure. MRLs are based on noncancerous health effects only and do not consider carcinogenic effects. MRLs can be derived for acute, intermediate, and chronic duration exposures for inhalation a nd oral routes. Appropriate methodology does not exist to deve lop MRLs for dermal exposure. Although methods have been established to derive these levels (Barnes and Dourson 1988; EPA 1990), uncertainties are associated with these techniques. Furthermore, ATSDR acknowledges additional uncertainties inherent in the application of the pro cedures to derive less than lifetime MRLs. As an example, acute inhalation MRLs may not be protective for health effects that are delayed in development or are acquired following repeated acute insults, such as hypersensitiv ity reactions, asthma, or chronic bronchitis. As these kinds of health effects data become available and methods to assess levels of significant human exposure improve , these MRLs will be revised. Inhalation MRLs No inhalation MRLs have been derived for zinc. A number of acute-duration studies of exposed workers have identified metal fume fever as an end point of con cern, with effects generally noted at airborne zinc oxide levels of 77-600 mg zinc/m 3 (Blanc et al. 1991; Hammond 1944; Sturgis et al. 1927). However, these occupational studies were not able to adequately control or correct for possible exposure to other compounds, and were therefore not suitable for use in MRL derivation. Animal studies (Amdur et al. 1982; Drinker and Drinker 1928) corroborate the effects observed in humans; however, the studies are generally limited in the methods utilized, and other possi ble targets of toxicity were not examined. Only one chronic-duration inhalation study in humans was located (Ameille et al. 1992). In this study, exposure levels were not reported; thus, the study c ould not be used as the basis for the derivation of a chronic-duration MRL. Thus, no chronic-dur ation inhalation MRL could be derived. ZINC 17 2. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Oral MRLs An oral acute MRL was not derived for zinc. A number of case reports involving high-dose acute exposure were located (Brandao-Neto et al. 199 0a; and Gentzkow 1937; Lewis and Kokan 1998; Murphy 1970); nausea, vomiting, and other signs of gastrointestinal distress were the primary effects noted. However, a great deal of uncertainty exists for these studies, including a lack of accurate assessment of exposure levels and a minimal evaluatio n of end points. Animal studies of acute-duration oral exposure to zinc are generally limited to studi es of mortality (Domingo et al. 1988a; Straube et al. 1980), with the exception of a study in rats that only evaluated effects on the central nervous system (Kozik et al. 1980). As no studies sufficient for derivation of an acute oral MRL were available, no value was derived. An MRL of 0.3 mg zinc/kg/day has been derive d for intermediate-duration oral exposure (15- 364 days) to zinc. Prolonged oral exposure to zinc has been shown to decrease the absorption of copper from the diet, resulting in the development of copper deficiency. At low doses (~0.7-0.9 mg zinc/kg/day) and intermediate exposure durati ons (6-13 weeks), the effect is minor and manifests as subclinical changes in copper-sensitive enzymes, such superoxide dismutase (D avis et al. 2000; Fischer et al. 1984; Milne et al. 2001; Yadrick et al. 1989). At higher exposure levels (~2 mg zinc/kg/day) for chronic duration, more severe symptoms of copper deficiency, including anem ia, have been reported (Broun et al. 1990; Gyorffy and Chan 1992; Hale et al. 1988; Hoffman et al. 1988 ; Patterson et al. 1985; Porter et al. 1977; Prasad Summerfield et al. 1992). Available intermediate-duration studies have examined the effect of zinc supplementation on sensitive biological indices in humans. A series of two st udies (Bonham et al. 2003a, 2003b) and immunological as well as several copper-sensitive enzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase) in healthy men exposed to 0.43 mg supplemental zinc/kg/day, and reported no significant changes resulting from zinc exposure. Studies by three other groups have evaluated exposures in the 0.6-0.8 mg zinc/kg/day range and identified slight but measurable effects. A study in postmenopausal women receiving a total of 53 mg zi nc/day (44 mg supplemental zinc/day, or 0.68 mg supplemental zinc/kg/day) (Davis et al. 2000; Miln e et al. 2001) (~25%) (~30%) and pl asma 5'-nucleotidase (~36%) activity. Another study (Fischer et al. 1984) exposed groups of male volunteers to 0.71 mg supplemental zinc/kg/day for ZINC 18 2. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH 6 weeks; erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (ESOD) activity decreased after 4 weeks in the supplement group and was significantly lower than controls by 6 weeks. In women exposed to 0.83 mg supplemental zinc/kg/day for 10 weeks, ESOD activity declined ov er the supplementation period and was significantly (p<0.05) lower (47% decrease) than pretreatment values at 10 weeks (Yadrick et al. 1989). While the decrease in ESOD activity repo rted in the available human studies is noteworthy, it is important to note that other enzymes, including catalase and ot her forms of superoxide dismutase, also serve to detoxify superoxide within the body. The overall effect of reducing the levels of an isoform of superoxide dismutase on the body's ability to detoxify superoxide radical is therefore uncertain. The subjects in the zinc supplementation studies did not report increased frequencies of clinical signs or symptoms. The other changes in copper status acros s the studies evaluating zinc supplementation in the 50 mg/day range, such as changes in alkaline phosphatase, mononuclear white cell 5'-nucleotidase, and plasma 5'-nucleotidase activities (Davis et al. 2000; Milne et al. 2001), are generally slight and of questionable clinical and biological significance. The subclinical changes in copper status observed in the intermediate-duration studies of zinc supplementation (Davis et al. 2000; Fischer et al. 1984; Milne et al. 2001; Yadrick et al. 1989) are considered nonadverse effects. Yadrick et al. (1989) also reported decreased serum ferritin in zinc-supplemented (0.86 mg supplemental zinc/kg/day) premenopausal women. A statistically significant decrease in serum ferritin levels from 36.6 to 28.2 \u00b5 g/L (23% decrease), was observed. According to the most recent NHANES data (cited in IOM 2000), the median range for serum ferritin levels in menstruating women is 36-40 \u00b5g/L, while a value of <12 \u00b5g/L represents depleted iron stores. Thus, th e subjects in the Yadrick study dropped below the median range for women of their age group, but were still considerably above the level that would represent a depletion of iron stores. This is supported by a lack of reported changes in hemoglobin or hematocrit levels in the study population (Yadrick et al. 1989). In a 90-day study of postmenopausal women exposed to 0.68 mg supplemental zinc/kg/day while living in a metabolic ward (Milne et al. 2001), no changes were reported in serum iron, hematocr it, or percentage of transferrin saturation were observed. However, the study did not evaluate ferritin levels, which are the most sensitive indicator of body iron stores. Other studies that evaluated similar zinc dose levels (Black et al. 1988; Fischer et al. 1984) have not evaluated ferritin leve ls or other indices of iron status. ATSDR considers the subclinical change in iron stores as indicated by a decrease in serum ferritin levels to be nonadverse. As it identified the highest NOAEL for effects of zi nc exposure, the Yadrick et al. (1989) study was selected as the principal study for MRL derivation. The study identified subclinical changes in copper ZINC 19 2. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH status (decreased ESOD levels) and iron status (decre ased ferritin levels) in women exposed to 0.83 mg supplemental zinc/kg/day. This exposure level w as designated a NOAEL and selected as the point of departure for the derivation of the MRL. The uncer tainty factor for MRL derivation was 3, representing uncertainties involving intrahuman variability; a larger factor for sensitive populations was not believed necessary, as women already represent a sensitive populati on with regards to changes in iron status. The resulting intermediate-duration MRL is 0.3 mg/kg/day. It should be noted that the MRL is calculated based on the assumption of healthy dietary levels of zinc (and copper), and represents the level of exposure above and beyond the normal diet that is believed to be without an appreciable risk of toxic response. The MR L is based on soluble zinc salts; it is less likely that nonsoluble zinc compounds would have these effects at similar exposure levels. The intermediate-duration oral MRL of 0.3 mg zinc/kg/day has been accepted as the chronic oral MRL. The chronic oral MRL is expected to be without a dverse effects when consumed on a daily basis over a long period of time; neither induc ing nutritional deficiency in h ealthy, nonpregnant, adult humans ingesting the average American diet nor resulting in adverse effects from excess consumption. The MRL was not based on a chronic-duration oral study due to a lack of adequate long-term studies in humans and animals. Several studies have reported copper defi ciency-induced anemia resulting from longer-term exposure to zinc, either via supplements or other sources (Broun et al. 1990; Gyorffy and Chan 1992; Hale et al. 1988; Hoffman et al. 1988; Patterson et al. 1985; Porter et al. 1977; Summerfield et al. 1992); effects generally occurred at estimated exposure levels of approximately 2-10 mg zinc/kg/day. However, the available studies are limited by small numbers of subjects evaluated (often a singl e individual), limited evaluation of end points, and limited reporting of study results, making them unsuita ble for use in the derivation of a chronic-duration MRL. ZINC 21 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.1 INTRODUCTION The primary purpose of this chapter is to provide public health officials, physicians, toxicologists, and other interested individuals and grou ps with an overall perspective on the toxicology of zinc. It contains descriptions and evaluations of toxicological studies and epidemiological investigations and provides conclusions, where possible, on the relevance of toxi city and toxicokinetic da ta to public health. A glossary and list of acronyms, abbreviations, and symbols can be found at the end of this profile. Zinc is an essential nutrient in humans and animals th at is necessary for the function of a large number of metalloenzymes. These and ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase. As such, zinc is required for normal nucleic acid, protein, and membrane metabolism, as well as cell growth and divi sion. Zinc also plays an essential role in the maintenance of nucleic acid structure of genes (z inc finger phenomenon). Zinc deficiency has been associated with dermatitis, anorexia, growth reta rdation, poor wound hea ling, hypogonadism with impaired reproductive capacity, impaired immune function, and depressed mental function; increased incidence of congenital malformations in infants has also been associated with zinc deficiency in the mothers (Cotran et al. 1989; Elinder 1986; Sandstead 1981) . Zinc deficiency may also have an impact on carcinogenesis, though the direction of the influen ce seems to vary with the agent (Fong et al. 1978; Mathur 1979; Wallenius et al. 1979). Therefore, certa in levels of zinc intake are recommended. The RDA for zinc is 11 mg/day in men and 8 mg/day in women (IOM 2002). Higher RDAs are recommended for women during pregnancy and lactation (12 mg/day for pregnant women and nursing women). While a detailed discussion of zinc deficiency is beyond the scope of this toxicological profile, the subject has been thoroughly reviewed by other agencies (IOM 2002; WHO 1996). Just as zinc deficiency has been associated with adverse effects in humans and animals, overexposures to zinc also have been associated with toxic effects. This chapter contains a description of the toxic effects that have been associated with exposures to high le vels of zinc and selected zinc compounds by the inhalation, oral, and dermal routes. Specifically, zinc chloride, zinc oxide, zinc sulfate, and zinc sulfide will be discussed. Other zinc compounds are discussed in this chapter whenever data regarding these ZINC 22 3. HEALTH EFFECTS compounds add relevant information to the discussion on zinc. Any general comments regarding the lack of data on zinc refer to both zinc and its compounds. Because there are differences in toxicity between the various zinc compounds following inhalation exposure, these compounds will be discussed under separ ate subheadings in Section 3.2.1 (Inhalation Exposure). After oral or dermal exposure, the toxicities are comparable for all zinc compounds. Therefore, in Section 3.2.2 (Oral Exposure) and S ection 3.2.3 (Dermal Exposure), the discussion will not be subdivided, but the specific zinc compounds will be identified in each case. 3.2 DISCUSSION OF HEALTH EFFECTS BY ROUTE OF EXPOSURE To help public health professiona ls and others address the needs of persons living or working near hazardous waste sites, the information in this section is organized first by route of exposure (inhalation, oral, and dermal) and then by health effect (deat h, systemic, immunological, neurological, reproductive, developmental, genotoxic, and carcinog enic effects). These data are discussed in terms of three exposure periods: acute (14 days or less), intermediate ( 15-364 days), and chronic (365 days or more). Levels of significant exposure for each route and duration are presented in tables and illustrated in figures. The points in the figures showing no-obser ved-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) or lowest\u00ad observed-adverse-effect levels (LOAELs) reflect the act ual doses (levels of exposure) used in the studies. LOAELs have been classified into \"less serious\" or \" serious\" effects. \"Serious\" effects are those that evoke failure in a biological system and can lead to morbidity or mortality (e.g., acute respiratory distress or death). \"Less serious\" effects are those that are not expected to cause significant dysfunction or death, or those whose significance to the organism is not entirely clear. ATSDR acknowledges that a considerable amount of judgment may be required in establishing whether an end point should be classified as a NOAEL, \"less serious\" LOAEL, or \"serious \" LOAEL, and that in some cases, there will be insufficient data to decide whether the effect is indicative of significant dysfunction. However, the Agency has established guidelines and policies that are used to classify these end points. ATSDR believes that there is sufficient merit in this appro ach to warrant an attempt at distinguishing between \"less serious\" and \"serious\" effects. The distinction be tween \"less serious\" effects and \"serious\" effects is considered to be important because it helps the users of the profiles to identify levels of exposure at which major health effects start to appear. LOAELs or NO AELs should also help in determining whether or not the effects vary with dose and/or duration, and pl ace into perspective the po ssible significance of these effects to human health. ZINC 23 3. HEALTH EFFECTS The significance of the exposure levels shown in the Levels of Significant Exposure (LSE) tables and figures may differ depending on the user's perspective. Public health officials and others concerned with appropriate actions to take at hazardous waste sites may want information on levels of exposure associated with more subtle effects in humans or animals (LOAELs) or exposure levels below which no adverse effects (NOAELs) have been observed. Es timates of levels posing minimal risk to humans (Minimal Risk Levels or MRLs) may be of inte rest to health professionals and citizens alike. A User's Guide has been provided at the end of this profile (see Appendix B). This guide should aid in the interpretation of the tables and figures for Levels of Significant Exposure and the MRLs. 3.2.1 Inhalation Exposure 3.2.1.1 Death In humans, death has resulted from acute exposure to zinc compounds. When a high concentration (estimated at 33,000 mg zinc/m 3) of zinc chloride smoke resulted fro m the explosion of many generators in a tunnel following a bombing raid in World War II, 10 of the 70 exposed people in the tunnel died within 4 days (Evans 1945). The smoke generated contained mainly highly caustic zinc chloride, but exposure to other constituents, namely zinc oxide, hexachloroethane, calcium silicate, and an igniter, was also possible. Therefore, the deaths resulting from th e explosion cannot be conclusively attributed to only exposure to zinc chloride. This is the only human study reporting an estimated exposure level that caused death. Another study reported the death of a fireman e xposed to the contents of a smoke bomb in a closed environment (Milliken et al. 1963). The man died 18 days after exposure because of respiratory difficulty. Again, exposure to zinc chloride was simultaneous with exposure to other substances in the smoke. Two soldiers exposed w ithout gas masks to zinc chloride smoke during military training developed severe adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and died 25-32 days after the incident (Hjortso et al. 1988). Diffuse microvascular obliteration, widespread occlusion of the pulmonary arteries, and extensive interstitial and intra-alveol ar fibrosis were observed at autops y. Zinc levels in major organs and tissues obtained during autopsy were within the nor mal range, and no zinc par ticles were observed by scanning electron microscopy. According to the authors, the fumes from the smoke bombs consisted mainly of zinc chloride. However, no exposure leve ls were estimated, and other substances were also present in the smoke. Because of the caustic nature of zinc chloride, it is likely that these effects were the result of severe irritation from the compound, rather than direct actions of the zinc ion. ZINC 24 3. HEALTH EFFECTS A case study presented by Murray (1926) reported on an infant death due to bronchopneumonia resulting from inhalation, and possibly ingestion, of an unsp ecified amount of zinc stearate powder spilled from a container. However, it is unclear whether the death was due to the zinc content or whether aspiration bronchopneumonia would result from inhalation of similar powders that do not contain zinc. In mice, the reported LCT 50 (product of lethal concentration and ti me to kill 50% of animals) of zinc chloride is 11,800 mg/minute/m3 (Schenker et al. 1981). However, Sc henker et al. (1981) did not provide information on how this value was determined. Following exposure to zinc chloride smoke for 3- 20 weeks, mortality was 50% in mice exposed to 121.7 mg zinc/m3 (compared to 20% in controls) and 22% in guinea pigs exposed to 119.3 mg zinc/m3 (compared to 8% in controls) (Marrs et al. 1988). The smoke was similar to that described by Evans (1945) and also contained zinc oxide, hexachloroethane, and other compounds. 3.2.1.2 Systemic Effects The highest NOAEL values and all LOAEL values from each reliable study for systemic effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 3-1 and plotted in Figure 3-1. No studies were located regarding musculoskeletal, endocrine, dermal, or body weight effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to zinc or zi nc compounds. The systemic effects observed after inhalation exposure are discussed below. In most cases, the effects of zinc are discussed without separating effects caused by the individual zinc co mpounds. However, the respiratory effects of the individual zinc compounds are discussed separately because the nature of the respiratory toxicity differs depending on the particular com pound to which one is exposed. Respiratory Effects. Zinc Oxide. Metal fume fever, a well-documented acut e disease induced by intense inhalation of metal oxides, especially zinc, impairs pulmonary function but does not progress to chronic lung disease (Brown 1988; Drinker and Drinker 1928; Malo et al. 1990). Symptoms generally appear within a few hours after acute exposure, usually with dryness of the throat and coughing (Drinker et al. 1927b).

HEALTH EFFECTS prominent respiratory effects of metal fume fever ar e substernal chest pain, cough, and dyspnea (Rohrs 1957). The impairment of pulmonary function is ch aracterized by reduced lung volumes and a decreased diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (Malo et al. 1990; Vogelmeier et al. 1987). The respiratory effects have been shown to be accompanied by an increase in bronchiolar leukocytes (Vogelmeier et al. 1987). The respiratory symptoms generally disappear in th e exposed individual within 1-4 days (Brown 1988; Drinker et al. 1927b; Sturgis et al. 1927). Inhalation of zinc oxide is most likely to occur in occupational situations where zinc smelting or welding take place. Ultrafine zinc oxide particles (0.2-1.0 \u00b5m) originate from heating zinc beyond its boiling point in an oxidizing atmosphere. Upon inhalation, these small particles (<1 \u00b5m) reach the alveoli and cause in flammation and tissue damage in the lung periphery (Brown 1988; Drinker et al. 1927b; Vogelmeier et al. 1987). A number of studies have measured e xposure levels associated with metal fume fever. Workers involved in pouring molten zinc reported shortness of br eath and chest pains 2-12 hours following exposure to 320-580 mg zinc/m3 as zinc oxide for 1-3 hours (Hammond 1944); the number of workers was not reported. Two volunteers had nasal passage irritation, c ough, substernal chest pain, persistent rales of the lung base, and a decreased vital capacity for appr oximately 3-49 hours following acute inhalation (10- 12 minutes) of 600 mg zinc/m3 as zinc oxide (Sturgis et al. 1927). This study is limited due to an inadequate number of subjects, a lack of controls, and a lack of analysis of the final aerosol product. A subject experimentally exposed to zinc oxide fumes reported mild pain when breathing deeply the next day after a 5-hour exposure to 430 mg zinc/m3 (Drinker et al. 1927a). Minimal changes in forced expiratory flow were observed 1 hour after a 15-30-minute exposure to 77 mg zinc/m3 as zinc oxide (Blanc et al. 1991). Acute experimental exposures to lower c oncentrations of zinc oxide (14 mg/m3 for 8 hours or 45 mg zinc/m3 for 20 minutes) and occupational exposures to similar concentrations (8-12 mg zinc/m3 for 1- 3 hours and 0.034 mg zinc/m3 for 6-8 hours) did not produce symptoms of metal fume fever (Drinker et al. 1927b; Hammond 1944; Marquart et al. 1989). In a single-blind experiment, exposure of subjects to 3.9 mg zinc/m3 as zinc oxide resulted in sore throat and chest tightness but no impairment of pulmonary function (Gordon et al. 1992). It is speculated that subjects in other studies may have been less susceptible because of the development of tolerance to zinc (Gordon et al. 1992). Kuschner et al. (1995) exposed a group of 14 volunteers to a single exposure of varying levels of zinc oxide fume (mean concentration 16.4\u00b112.5 mg/m 3) for 15-120 minutes (mean duration 45\u00b128 minutes) and evaluated the response by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Significa nt increases were reported in the number of poly\u00ad morphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes in the BAL fluid, but not in the number of macrophages or in ZINC 30 3. HEALTH EFFECTS lymphocyte subpopulations; aside from a decrease in FEV 1, no changes were reported in pulmonary function tests. In a follow-up study by the same group (Kuschner et al. 1997), single-exposed volunteers showed an increase in levels of the cytokines TNF, IL-6, and IL-8 as a result of zinc oxide inhalation. Recurrent episodes of cough and dyspnea were reporte d in a former mild smoker 3 years after beginning work in a metal foundry where exposure to zinc oxi de presumably occurred (Ameille et al. 1992). This case was distinguishable from metal fume fever because of the lack of tolerance to zinc (as shown by the late emergence of symptoms). Several animal studies have been conducted to quantify specific effects after acute zinc oxide inhalation. As in human exposure, the respiratory system is the primary site of injury following inhalation exposure. Acute administration of 88-482 mg zinc/m3 as zinc oxide to rats and rabbits resulted in the following pulmonary changes: grayish areas with pulmonary congestion, various degrees of peribronchial leukocytic infiltration, and bronchial exudate com posed almost entirely of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Drinker and Drinker 1928). Cats similarly exposed exhibited more severe effects including bronchopneumonia, leukocyte infiltration into alveoli, and grayish areas with congestion. During the exposure period, the cats demonstrated labored breathing and evidence of upper respiratory tract obstruction. A minimum effect level could not be determined for any species because the concentration varied widely (88-482 mg zinc/m 3) during exposure. Guinea pigs administered 0.73 mg zinc/m3 as zinc oxide for 1 hour had a progressive decrease in lung compliance but no change in air flow resistance. These observations reflect a response in the lung periphery where submicrometer aerosols are likely to de posit (Amdur et al. 1982). The authors postulated that reduced compliance may be associated with human metal fume fever. In contrast to the results of Amdur et al. (1982) , no effects on ventilation, lung mechanics (respiratory frequency, tidal volume, pulmonary resistance, a nd pulmonary compliance), diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide, or most lung volume para meters were observed by Lam et al. (1982) following the exposure of guinea pigs to 6.3 mg zinc/m3 as zinc oxide for 3 hours. However, functional residual capacity was significantly decreased. The discrep ancy between the results of Amdur et al. (1982) and Lam et al. (1982) may be attributable to the use of anesthetized animals by Lam et al. (1982). In a later study, exposures of guinea pigs to 3.7 or 4.3 mg zinc/m 3 as zinc oxide for 3 hours/day, for 6 days, resulted in transient functional, morphological, and biochemical changes (Lam et al. 1985). Functional changes included increased flow resistance, decreased lung co mpliance, and decreased diffusing capacity, all of which returned to normal within 24-72 hours followi ng exposure. The morphological changes (increased ZINC 31 3. HEALTH EFFECTS lung weight, inflammation involving the proximal por tion of alveolar ducts and adjacent alveoli, interstitial thickening, and increased pulmonary m acrophages and neutrophils in adjacent air spaces) were, however, still present at 72 hours. In guinea pigs with evidence of an inflammatory reaction involving the peripheral airways, DNA synthesis increased in bronchiolar cells. Similarly, exposure of guinea pigs to 5.6 mg zinc/m3 as zinc oxide for 3 hours/day, for 5 days, resulted in gradual decreases in total lung capacity, vital capacity, and decreased carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (Lam et al. 1988); however, no effects were observed in guinea pigs exposed to 2.2 mg zinc/m 3. The reason that effects have been seen in the guinea pig at exposure levels lo wer than humans may have to do with the structural features of the guinea pig lung. The bronchi and peripheral airways of guinea pigs have a thicker smooth muscle layer and only a small surface area covered by alveolar sacs compared to the bronchi and peripheral airways of other laboratory animals and humans. This ma kes the guinea pig more susceptible than other laboratory animals to functional impairment of the peripheral airways and should be noted in toxicity comparisons (Lam et al. 1982). The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of rats or guinea pigs exposed to 1.8 mg zinc/m 3 as zinc oxide for 3 hours contained increased levels of lactate dehydr ogenase and total protein, suggesting effects on cell viability or membrane permeability (Gordon et al. 1992). Rabbits were not affected following a similar exposure to 4.6 mg zinc/m3 for 2 hours. Guinea pigs had foci of inflammation after exposure to 4.7 mg zinc/m3 for 3 days, and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid c ontained increased levels of protein, angiotensin converting enzyme, and neutrophils (Conner et al. 1988). No significant changes in respiratory effects were observed in this study following exposure to 1.8 mg zinc/m3 for 3 days. Zinc Chloride . Zinc chloride, a corrosive inorganic salt, is more damaging than zinc oxide to the mucous membranes of the nasopharynx and respiratory tract upon contact. Zinc chloride is a primary ingredient in smoke bombs used by the military for screening purposes, crowd dispersal, and occasionally in military and civilian fire-fighting exercises. Reports of serious respiratory injury have been reported to result from accidental inhalation of smoke from these bombs. These reports are of limited use in assessing the toxicity of zinc chloride because exposure to othe r compounds, usually hexachloroethane, zinc oxide, and calcium silicides, also o ccur. Furthermore, the specific concen trations inhaled are usually unknown. Despite these limitations, several case studies have described similar respiratory effects in humans following acute inhalation exposures. These effects incl ude dyspnea, cough, pleuritic chest pain, bilateral diffuse infiltrations, pneumothorax, and acute pneumon itis from respiratory tract irritation (Johnson and Stonehill 1961; Matarese and Matthews 1966; Schenker et al. 1981; Zerahn et al. 1999). In the study by Johnson and Stonehill (1961), cough, dyspnea, burning throat, diffuse infiltrates throughout the lung, ZINC 32 3. HEALTH EFFECTS chemical pneumonitis, and decreased vital capacity were observed at an estimated zinc chloride exposure level of 4,075 mg/m3 (1,955 mg zinc/m3). In other studies, more severe effects have occurred, including ulcerative and edematous changes in mucous membra nes, fibrosis, ndrome (Evans 1945; Hjortso et al. 1988; Homma et Milliken et al. 1963). Focal alveolitis, consolidation, emphysema, infiltrati on with macrophages, and fibrosis were observed in guinea pigs that died following exposure to 119 mg zinc/m3 as zinc chloride smoke for 1 hour/day, 5 days/week, for 3-20 weeks (Marrs et al. 1988); no changes were seen in guinea pigs that survived 13 months after the 20-week exposure. Thirteen mont hs after a 20-week exposure, rats similarly exposed to 12.8 mg zinc/m3 showed an increase in peribronchial inflammatory cell (lymphocytes and macrophage) infiltration. Mice exposed to 121.7 mg zinc/m3 as zinc chloride smoke, but not to lower doses, for 1 hour/day, 5 days/week, showed increased macrophag es and lymphocytes in the lungs (Marrs et al. 1988). The smoke also contained zinc oxide , hexachloroethane, and other compounds. Zinc Ammonium Sulfate . Zinc ammonium sulfate is a co mpound emitted during combustion of fossil fuels and is, therefore, found in the ambient air. Humans acutely exposed to a concentration of 0.0036 mg zinc/m3 as zinc ammonium sulfate for 2 hours (Linn et al. 1981) exhibited minimal or no short-term respiratory effects (including minimal substernal irr itation, throat irritation, and coughing in asthmatic subjects). However, most human exposures to an am bient air pollutant such as zinc ammonium sulfate are chronic, and this study provides little information about the health effects associated with typical exposures. No studies were located regarding respiratory eff ects in animals after inhalation exposure to zinc ammonium sulfate. Zinc Stearate . Inhalation of zinc stearate powder resulted in aspiration bronchopneumonia in an infant (Murray 1926). However, it is unclear whether the bronchopneumonia resulted from the inhalation of zinc stearate powder specifically or from a nons pecific effect of the inhalation of powders. No studies were located regarding respiratory effects in animals after inhalation exposure to zinc stearate. Cardiovascular Effects. No atypical heart sounds or blood pressure abnormalities were observed in 24 employees occupationally exposed to concentrations as high as 130 mg zinc/m 3 of metallic zinc dust, ZINC 33 3. HEALTH EFFECTS zinc oxide dust, zinc sulfide dust, or lithophone dust (a combination of barium sulphate and 30% zinc sulphide) for 2-35.5 years (Batchelor et al. 1926). However, this study is limited because only selected employees were examined. Only limited information was located regarding car diovascular effects in animals following inhalation exposure to zinc. Routine gross and microscopic exam ination of the hearts of rats and mice revealed no adverse effects 13 months after exposure to 121.7 mg zinc/m3 as zinc chloride smoke (also containing other compounds) for 1 hour/day, 5 days/week, for 20 weeks (Marrs et al. 1988). Similarly, no changes were observed in the hearts of guinea pigs exposed to 119.3 mg zinc/m3 as zinc chloride smoke for 1 hour/day, 5 days/week, for 20 weeks, and then observe d for an additional 17 months (Marrs et al. 1988). Gastrointestinal Effects. Nausea was reported by humans exposed to high concentrations of zinc oxide fumes (Hammond 1944; Rohrs 1957; Sturgis et al. 1927) and (Evans 1945; Johnson and Stonehill 1961; Schenker et al. 1981). The zinc chloride smoke also contained zinc oxide, hexachloroethane, and other compounds. In general, exposure levels associated with nausea have not been reported. However, exposures to 320 mg zinc/m 3 as zinc oxide for 1-3 hours (Hammond 1944) or 600 mg zinc/m3 as zinc oxide for 10-12 minutes (Sturgis et al. 1927) were reported to have resulted in nausea; it should be noted, however, that the zinc used in these studies contained slight impurities (i.e., lead, magnesium). Autopsies of victims who died foll owing exposure to very high concentrations of zinc chloride smoke revealed irritation of the stomach a nd intestines (Evans 1945). The smoke also contained zinc oxide, hexachloroethane, and other compounds. Workers in the galvanizing industry were found by McCord et al. (1926) to have a higher than expected incidence of gastrointestinal problems; however, these individuals may have been exposed to other ch emicals (arsenic, hydrogen sulfide). Of 15 workers examined with 7-20 years of experience, 12 had fre quent episodes of epigastric or abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, ulcers, constipation, tarry stools, a nd/or gas. It is unclear whether these effects were due to systemic zinc or were the result of direct contact with the gastrointestinal tract following mucociliary clearance of inhaled zinc particles and s ubsequent swallowing. In contrast, 24 workers with 2-35.5 years of exposure to 130 mg zinc/m 3 as metallic zinc dust, zinc sulfide dust, zinc oxide, or lithophone dust reported no nausea or vomiting and only occasional mild abdominal discomfort that could not be attributed with certainty to zinc exposure (Batchelor et al. 1926). A study examining the acidity of the stomach contents after stimulation in controls and workers employed in the production of brass alloys showed that stomach acidity was similar in the two gr oups prior to stimulation but remained elevated for longer periods after stimulation in the exposed workers (Hamdi 1969). This was proposed to account for ZINC 34 3. HEALTH EFFECTS the gastric complaints of workers exposed to zinc fumes. Despite these findings, x-rays showed no lesions in the stomachs or duodenums of exposed workers. The only information available regarding gastrointes tinal effects in animals was found in a study by Marrs et al. (1988) in which rats and mice were exposed to 121.7 mg zinc/m3 as zinc chloride smoke (which also contains zinc oxide, hexachlorophene , and other compounds) for 1 hour/day, 5 days/week, for 20 weeks, and then observed for an additional 13 months . In the same study, guinea pigs were exposed to 119.3 mg zinc/m3 as zinc chloride smoke for 1 hour/day, 5 da ys/week, for 3 weeks. All animals were sacrificed at the end of 18 months. Routine gross and microscopic evaluation of the stomach and intestines at 18 months revealed no persistent adverse effects. Hematological Effects. Leukocytosis persisting for approxima tely 12 hours after fever dissipates is one of the hallmarks of metal fume fever (Mueller a nd Seger 1985). Such effects have been observed in a number of case reports of occupationa l and experimental exposure of humans to zinc oxide fumes (Brown 1988; Drinker et al. 1927a; Malo et al. 1990; Rohrs 1957; Sturgis et Increased leukocyte counts were observed following experime ntal exposures to 430 mg zinc/m3 as zinc oxide for 3 hours (Drinker et al. 1927a) or 600 mg zinc/m3 as zinc oxide for 10-12 minutes (Sturgis et al. 1927). These studies are limited in that they used an inadequate number of subjects, lacked controls, and used impure zinc oxide. Decreased numbers of red blood cells and hemoglobin were found in several workers with 7-20 years of experience in the galvanizing industry (McCord et al . 1926). However, there were excess tobacco use and alcohol consumption by workers and possible concurrent exposure to other chemicals (chloride, sulfide), which confound the study results. No an emia was detected among 12 workers exposed for 4- 21 years to zinc oxide fumes in the production of brass alloys (Hamdi 1969). These workers may have also been exposed to magnesium, copper, and aluminum. No studies were located regarding hematological eff ects in animals after inhalation exposure to zinc. Hepatic Effects. Routine blood chemistries and ex aminations revealed no liver disease among 12 workers with 4-21 years of exposure to zinc oxide fumes in the production of brass alloys (Hamdi 1969). No adverse effects were observed during gross and micr oscopic examination of livers of rats and guinea pigs exposed to 121.7 mg zinc/m3 or 119.3 mg zinc/m3, respectively, as zinc chloride smoke for ZINC 35 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 1 hour/day, 5 days/week, for 20 weeks, and sacrificed at the end of 18 months (Marrs et al. 1988). Significant increases in the incidence of fatty liver we re observed in mice exposed to 12.8 or 121.7 mg zinc/m3 as zinc chloride smoke using the same expos ure paradigm; however, the incidence did not increase with dose (Marrs et al. 1988). The smoke contained other compounds in addition to zinc chloride. Renal Effects. Urinalyses and histories of urinary func tion revealed no adverse effects in 24 workers exposed for 2-35.5 years to 130 mg zinc/m 3 as metallic zinc dust, zinc sulfide dust, zinc oxide, or lithophone dust (Batchelor et al. 1926). No adverse effects were observed following gross a nd microscopic examination of kidneys from rats, mice, and guinea pigs exposed for 1 hour/day, 5 days /week, for 20 weeks, to concentrations as high as 121.7 or 119.3 mg zinc/m3 as zinc chloride smoke (which also contained other compounds) and then sacrificed 13 months later (Marrs et al. 1988). Ocular Effects. Reddened conjunctiva and corneal burns occurred in individuals exposed to high concentrations of zinc chloride smoke (estimated at 33,000 mg zinc/m3) when several smoke generators exploded in a tunnel during World War II (Evans 1945). The ocular effects may have been due to direct contact with the smoke. Homeostatic Effects. A fever appearing 3-10 hours after exposure to zinc oxide fumes and lasting approximately 24-48 hours is characteristic of meta l fume fever caused by zinc (Mueller and Seger 1985). Elevated body temperature has been observed in a number of experimental and occupational zinc oxide exposures (Brown 1988; Drinker et al. 1927a; Hammond 1944; Vogelmeier et al. 1987). Using a number of exposure concentrations for various durations, Drinker et al. (1927b) found that the increase in body temperature was dependent on the exposure duration and concentration. Based on their da ta, they calculated that the threshold for pyrogenic effects was 45 mg zinc/m 3 for 20 minutes. This study is limited in that impurities were present in the zinc used and no statistical analysis was performed. Exposu re to zinc chloride smoke (which also contains other compounds) has also been associated with fever (Hjortso et al. 1988; Matarese and Matthews 1966). No studies were located regarding other systemic effe cts in animals following inhalation exposure to zinc. ZINC 36 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.2.1.3 Immunological and Lymphoreticular Effects One report described hives and angioedema in a man exposed to zinc fumes at a zinc smelting plant (Farrell 1987). The author suggested that the patie nt had an immediate or delayed immunoglobulin E (IgE) response (or both) after a low dose of zinc fu mes. Metal fume fever also resulted when the exposure increased. The signs and symptoms of toxicity were repeated in a cha llenge test conducted at the patient's home. In a group of 14 welders acutely exposed to 77-153 mg zinc/m3 as zinc oxide, significant correlations between the concentration of airborne zinc and the proportion of activated T cells, T helper cells, T inducer cells, T suppressor cells, and activated killer T cells were observed 20 hours after exposure (Blanc et al. 1991). In addition, significant incr eases in levels of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, macrophages, and all types of lymphocytes were observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 20 hours after exposure. Increased levels of lymphocytes, with a predominance of CD8 cells, in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were re ported in a case study of a smelter exposed to unspecified levels of zinc fumes (Ameille et al. 1992). The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of rats or guinea pigs exposed to 2.2 mg zinc/m 3 for 3 hours contained increased levels of -glucuronidase, suggesting a change in m acrophage function (Gordon et al. 1992). Rabbits were not affected following a similar exposure to 4.6 mg zinc/m3 for 2 hours. Rats, mice, and guinea pigs were exposed to concentrations as high as 119.3 or 121.7 mg zinc/m3 as zinc chloride smoke for 1 hour/day, 5 days/week, for 20 weeks (Marrs et al. 1988). Routine gross and histopathologic examination of the lymph nodes, thymus, and spleen at the end of 18 months revealed no adverse effects. The smoke also contained zinc oxide , hexachlorophene, and other compounds. 3.2.1.4 Neurological Effects Humans have reported nonspecific neurological effect s such as headaches and malaise in association with other symptoms following inhalation of zinc oxide an d in metal fume fever (Rohrs 1957; Sturgis et al. 1927). Staggering gait, hallucinati ons, and hilarity were observed in an individual who intentionally inhaled aerosols of metallic paint containing copper and zinc (Wilde 1975) . However, it is most likely that these effects were due to exposure to hydrocarbon propellant rather than zinc. Amr et al. (1997) reported an increase in neuropsychiatric symptoms, including fear of poisoning, headache, nervousness, insomnia, and changes in EEG, in workers who were occupationally-exposed to zinc phosphide for a ZINC 37 3. HEALTH EFFECTS period of many years; however, exposure levels were not reported, and no tests of statistical significance were performed. No studies were located regarding neurological eff ects in animals after inhalation exposure to zinc. 3.2.1.5 Reproductive Effects No studies were located regarding reproductive eff ects in humans after inhalation exposure to zinc. Following an initial exposure of ra ts, mice, and guinea pigs to c oncentrations as high as 119.3 or 121.7 mg zinc/m3 as zinc chloride smoke (which also contained other compounds) for 1 hour/day, 5 days/week, for 20 weeks; histological evaluation re vealed no adverse effects on the mammary glands, ovaries, fallopian tubes, or uteri were observed at 18 months (Marrs et al. 1988). 3.2.1.6 Developmental Effects No studies were located regarding developmental effects in humans or animals after inhalation exposure to zinc. 3.2.1.7 Cancer In two epidemiological studies, workers did not have an increased incidence of cancers associated with occupational exposure (primarily inhalation exposure) to zinc (Logue et al. 1982; Neuberger and Hollowell 1982). Workers in nine electrolytic zinc and copper refining plants were studied by Logue et al. (1982). The workers at two of these plants were exposed to zinc or zinc and copper; the other workers were exposed to copper. An association between cancer mo rtality and zinc exposure was not found. Excess lung cancer mortality associated with residence in an old lead/zinc mining and smelting area of the midwestern United States was studied by Neuberger and Hollowell (1982). The age- and sex-adjusted mortality rates were compared to state and national rates. The analysis determined that lung cancer mortality was elevated in the region but was not foun d to be associated with exposure to environmental ZINC 38 3. HEALTH EFFECTS levels of lead or zinc. Many confounding factors were not considered in the analysis, such as smoking, occupation, and duration of residence in the area in question. Female Porton strain mice (98-100/group) exposed to 121.7 mg zinc/m3 of a zinc oxide/hexachloroethane smoke mixture (which produces zinc chloride), 1 hour/day, 5 days/week, for 20 weeks had a statistically significant increase in the incidence of alveologenic carc inoma (30 versus 8% in control) thirteen months after the end of exposure (Marrs et al. 1988). No increased tumor incidences were seen in mice exposed to 1, 1.3, or 12.8 mg zinc/m3. Guinea pigs and rats were also t ested with similar dose levels, and no significant carcinogenic response was observed. A number of factors limit the usefulness of this study, including the presence of several compounds in the smoke that may have carcinogenic potential, the use of only female animals, and the shor t duration of the exposure (20 weeks). 3.2.2 Oral Exposure Zinc has been orally administered in a variety of forms, such as zinc chloride, zinc sulfate, zinc oxide, powdered zinc, and others. Some of these compounds, su ch as zinc sulfate, have been administered in both hydrated and anhydrous forms. Study authors often do not state definitely which form was used in a particular study. Knowledge of the form used and its molecular weight is necessary to calculate the amount of elemental zinc administered under a given set of circumstances, and is similarly important in that different chemical forms of zinc may be absorbed to differing degrees depending on their in vivo solubility, resulting in differing levels of toxicity. If adequate information was not reported by the study authors, it was assumed that an anhydrous, soluble compound was used. 3.2.2.1 Death In a case report presented by Murray (1926), an infant died from bronchopneumonia resulting from inhalation and ingestion of an unspecified amount of zinc stearate powder spilled from a container. However, the cause of death (bronchopneumonia) suggests that it resulted from the inhalation exposure, rather than the oral exposure, and it is unclear wh ether the lung damage resulted from the inhalation of zinc stearate powder specifically or from a ge neral effect of the inhalation of powders. The LD 50 values of several zinc compounds (ranging fro m 186 to 623 mg zinc/kg/day) have been determined in rats and mice (Domingo et al. 1988a). In general, mice appear to be more sensitive than ZINC 39 3. HEALTH EFFECTS rats to the lethal effects of zinc. In rats, zinc acetate was the most lethal compound tested; zinc nitrate, zinc chloride, and zinc sulfate (in order of decreasing t oxicity) were less lethal. In mice, the most lethal compound was zinc acetate followed by zinc nitrate, zinc sulfate, and zinc chloride. Ingestion of 390 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide in the diet for 3-13 days w as lethal to 3 of 3 ferrets (Straube et al. 1980). An equivalent dose in humans would be approximately 27 g zinc/day (which would probably be intolerable to humans because of gastric discomfort). Death was reported in mice that consumed 1,110 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate in their diet for 13 weeks (Maita et al. 1981). Mortality was also observed in 20% of rats ingesting 191 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc ace tate in drinking water for 3 months (Llobet et al. 1988a). The LD 50 values and all LOAEL values from each reliab le study for death in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 3-2 and plotted in Figure 3-2. 3.2.2.2 Systemic Effects The highest NOAEL values and all LOAEL values from each reliable study for systemic effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 3-2 and plotted in Figure 3-2. Ingestion of zinc or zinc-containing compounds has resulted in a variety of systemic effects in the gastrointestinal and hematological systems and a lterations in the blood lipid profile in humans and animals. In addition, lesions have been observed in the liver, pancreas, and kidneys of animals. No studies were located regarding respiratory, ocular, or metabolic effects in humans or animals after oral exposure to zinc. Observed systemic effects after oral exposure are disc ussed below. The effects discussed in case reports are not included in Table 3-2 or Figure 3-2 because of the small sample size and lack of control data. Cardiovascular Effects. A number of studies in humans and animals have examined the effects of zinc on serum cholesterol and triglycerides. Howe ver, no studies regarding the direct relationship between excessive zinc intake and cardiac mortality were located. No effects on electrocardiographic results were found in a group of elderly subjects (>65 years of age) taking zinc supplements of up to 2 mg zinc/kg/day (Hale et al. 1988) or 0.71 mg zinc/kg/day (Czerwinski et al. 1974). There was also no effect on the frequency of cardiovascular disease (heart attack, h eart failure, hypertension, or angina) in elderly subjects (>67 years of age) taking up to 2 mg zinc/kg/day for a mean of 8 years (Hale et Exposure to Zinc - Oral aKey to Figure Species (Strain) Exposure/ Duration/ Frequency (Route) ACUTE EXPOSURE Death 1 Rat (Sprague- Dawley) once (G) System NOAEL (mg/kg/day) Less Serious (mg/kg/day) Serious (mg/kg/day) 237 M (LD50) Reference Chemical Form Domingo et al. 1988a Zinc acetate 2 Rat (Sprague- Dawley) once (G) 623 M (LD50) Domingo et al. 1988a Zinc sulfate 3 Rat (Sprague- Dawley) once (G) 528 M (LD50) Domingo et al.

HEALTH EFFECTS In one study, patients having inoperable severe o cclusive vascular disease were administered 3.8 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate for at least 1 year (Henzel et al. 1971). Eighteen of the 24 patients experienced improvement in lower extremity blood flow and unchanged or decreased ar terial pressure. Zinc's role in these improvements was not completely understood by th e study authors. They hypothesized that when optimal zinc levels are provided to the ischemic limb, the activity of certain zinc enzymes promotes the reversal of tissue-dependent hypoxia and/or lactic acide mia in the muscles. It is also not known if this high dose of zinc was associated with any toxic effects. No studies were located regarding cardiovascular ef fects in animals after oral exposure to zinc. Gastrointestinal Effects. Several studies have suggested that zinc ingestion may cause symptoms of gastrointestinal distress or alterations in gastroin testinal tissues. For example, one individual who ingested about 3 ounces of a zinc chloride solution described acute symptoms that occurred almost immediately following contact with the compound, including burning and pain in the mouth and throat and vomiting (Chobanian 1981). Late r, the patient exhibited pharyng itis, esophagitis, hypocalcemia, and elevated levels of amylase; the latter two alterations are suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The patient received intravenous hydration and calcium supplementation and recovere d within 5 days. The material ingested was described as a \"zinc chlo ride solution,\" and its concentration was not reported. Therefore, a dose level could not be established in this case. Several cases of gastrointestinal disturbances have been reported after ingestion of zinc sulfate (Anonymous 1983; Brown et al. 1964; Moore 1978; Sa mman and Roberts 1987). Vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea, in several cases with blood, have been observed after ingestion of zinc sulfate. In one report, an English school girl ingested 440 mg zi nc sulfate/day (2.6 mg zinc/kg/day) in capsules as a medically prescribed treatment for acne (Moore 1978). After taking each capsule, she experienced epigastric discomfort. A week later, she was admitte d to the hospital after a fainting spell. She was diagnosed as anemic and subsequently passed melanic stools, indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding. Gastrointestinal upset (abdominal cramps, vomiting, na usea) occurred in 26 of 47 healthy volunteers following ingestion of zinc sulfate tablets (150 mg as zinc ion in three divided doses per day, 2 mg zinc/kg/day) for 6 weeks (Samman and Roberts 1987). A 17-year-old boy who ingested approximately 6.8 mg zinc/kg as zinc gluconate showed severe na usea and vomiting, but displayed no other symptoms, and recovered within 7 hours of ingestion (Lewis and Kokan 1998). Ingestion of zinc oxide has also been associated with gastrointestinal distress (Anonymous 1983; Callender and Gentzkow 1937). In one case, 80% of the personnel of two army companies became ill with gastrointestinal distress and diarrhea after ZINC 58 3. HEALTH EFFECTS consuming limeade prepared in galvanized trash cans (Callender and Gentzkow 1937). The average dose was estimated to be 6.7-7.1 mg/kg. A second exam ple was presented in a case involving school children in New Mexico who experienced nausea and vomiting af ter accidental excessive zinc intake (Anonymous 1983). These children had consumed punch containing high levels of zinc dissolved from galvanized hinges attached to tanks in which the punch was stor ed. A 16-year-old boy who ingested 12 g elemental zinc over a 2-day period (86 mg zinc/kg/day) experi enced light-headedness, lethargy, staggering gait, and difficulty writing legibly, but no apparent gastrointestinal disturbances (Murphy 1970). Gastrointestinal effects have also been observed in animals. Intestinal hemorrhages were observed in ferrets that ingested 390 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxi de for 2 weeks (Straube et al. 1980). These ferrets exhibited a 75% reduction in food intake. No in testinal hemorrhaging was observed in ferrets fed 195 mg/kg/day for up to 21 days. Oral zinc sulfate exposures of intermediate duration in other experimental animals have also resulted in gastroint estinal effects. Mice fed a diet providing 1,110 mg zinc/kg/day for 13 weeks developed ulcers in the fo restomach, but gastrointestinal effects were not observed in rats fed 565 mg zinc/kg/day for 13 weeks (Maita et al. 1981). Hematological Effects. In a case report, acute exposure to 2.6 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate for 1 week resulted in anemia (Moore 1978). The authors of the report noted that the anemia may have been secondary to the gastrointestinal hemorrhages. Treatment-related changes in hematol ogical parameters have been observed in humans and animals after intermediate or chronic exposure to zinc or zi nc-containing compounds. Long-term administration (1- 8 years) of zinc supplements has caused anemia in humans (Broun et al. 1990; Gyorffy and Chan 1992; Hale et al. 1988; Hoffman et al. 1988; Patterson et al. 1985; Porter et al. 1977; Prasad et al. 2002; Stroud 1991; Summerfield et al. 1992). Exposure of one patient to 2 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate for 10 months resulted in anemia (Hoffman et al. 1988). A significant reduction in erythrocyte superoxide dism utase to pretreatment levels, occurre d in female subjects who received supplements (as capsules) of 50 mg zinc/day as zinc gluconate for 10 w eeks (Yadrick et al. 1989); this study was selected as the basis for the intermediate-duration oral MRL. A 15% decrease in erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity was reported in male volunteers receiving 50 mg zinc/day as zinc gluconate for 6 weeks (Fischer et al. 1984). A more recent study by Davis et al. (2000; Milne et al. 2001) reported increases in bone- specific phosphatase levels (~25%) and ex tracellular (~15%), decreases were seen in mononuclear white cell 5'-nucleotidase (~30%) and plasma ZINC 59 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 5'-nucleotidase activity (~36%) following exposure of postmenopausal women to a combined (dietary+supplemental) 53 mg zinc/day as zinc glycine chelate. Healthy men given 200 mg zinc/day as elemental zinc for 6 weeks showed a reduction in lymphocyte stimulation response to phytohemag\u00ad glutinin as well as chemotaxis and phagocytosis of bacteria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Chandra et al. 1984); however, no changes in lymphocyte cell numbe r or in the proportion of lymphocyte populations were noted. Exposure of male volunteers to 0.48 mg zinc/kg/day, as zinc glycine chelate, had no effect on markers of coagulation (Bonham et al. 2003b) relativ e to unexposed subjects. While the changes in hematological end points following long-term zinc exposure in humans are noteworthy, they were subclinical in nature, and therefore, are generally considered to be non-adverse. In animals, following oral administration of zi nc compounds, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte, and/or leukocyte levels were observed in rats (Maita et al. 1981; Smith and Larson 1946), mice (Maita et al. 1981; Walters and Roe 1965), rabb its (Bentley and Grubb 1991), dogs (Drinker et al. 1927d; Meurs et al. 1991; Robinson et al. 1991), ferre ts (Straube et al. 1980), and preruminant calves (Jenkins and Hidiroglou 1991). In rats, the low est LOAEL for hematological effects was 4 mg/kg/day (8 mg/kg every other day) for an increased frequency of basophilic-stippled erythrocytes in rats exposed every other day for 14 days (Piao et al. 2003). The second lowest LOAEL is 12 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc chloride in a 4-week drinking water study with 2-mont h-old rats (Zaporowska and Wasilewski 1992) that reported decreased hemoglobin (85% of control values) and erythrocytes (90% of control values). The highest NOAEL in rats is 191 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc acetate in a 3-month drinking water study (age of rats not specified) (Llobet et al. 1988a). The reason that the lowest LOAEL is less than the highest NOAEL in rats is unclear, but it may be because of the use of different zinc compounds or different rat strains or age. For mice, NOAEL and LOAEL values of 104 and 1,110 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate, respectively, were identified by Maita et al. (1981) in a 13-week feeding study. A serious LOAEL of 68 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oleate was identified for severe anemia in a 9-month feeding study in mice (Walters and Roe 1965). It is not known if the diffe rence in the LOAELs identified in the Maita et al. (1981) and Walters and Roe (1965) studies is due to th e use of different zinc compounds, different basic diet formulations, different mouse strains, or different exposure durations. Slight decreases in hemoglobin levels were observed in rabbits fed 174 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc carbonate (Bentley and Grubb 1991). Zinc oxide consumption caused anemia in dogs (76.5 mg zinc/kg/day) (Drinker et al. 1927d), ferrets (195 mg zinc/kg/day) (Straube et al. 1980), a nd preruminant calves (64 mg zinc/kg/day) (Jenkins and Hidiroglou 1991). Hematological alterations we re not observed in cats exposed to up to 83.2 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide (Drinker et al. 1927d) or in adult mink exposed to zinc at up to 297.4 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide (Aulerich et al. 1991; Bl eavins et al. 1983) or to rats exposed to 53 mg ZINC 60 3. HEALTH EFFECTS zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate (Maita et al. 1981). Ho wever, decreases in hematocrit and lymphocytes were observed in the offspring of mink females that i ngested a time-weighted-average dose of 20.8 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate for 10 weeks prior to conception and throughout gestation and lactation (Bleavins et al. 1983) indicating that very young mink may be more sensitive to the hematologic effects of zinc than adults. An increased number of weanling rats had low levels of ceruloplasmin, a copper serum protein, after administration of zinc sulfate for 6 weeks (L'Abbe and Fischer 1984a). Musculoskeletal Effects. No studies were located regardi ng musculoskeletal effects in humans after oral exposure to zinc. Rib biopsies revealed no treatment-related effects in dogs given 4 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide in the diet for 9 months (Anderson and Danylchuk 1979). No lesions of the bones were observed in rats exposed to 565 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate during 13 weeks of exposure in the food (Maita et al. 1981). Hepatic Effects. Ingestion of 3.5 mg/kg/day zinc sulfate for 18 weeks by 13 patients being treated for chronic venous leg ulcers was reported to have no e ffect on the results of liver function tests (Hallbook and Lanner 1972). However, the type of liver func tion tests was not specified and results were not presented to support this conclusion. Several reports described changes in the serum lipid profile of humans exposed to zinc sulfate or gluconate for 3-12 months; however, the results are mi xed. Ingestion of 2.3-4.3 mg zinc/kg/day for 5- 6 weeks (Chandra 1984; Hooper et al. 1980) or 0.71 mg zinc/kg/day for 12 weeks (Black et al. 1988) reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) chol esterol. In the study by Chandra (1984), a slight increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was observed in subjects who served as their own controls; measurements were taken prior to zi nc supplementation and af ter a 10-week postexposure period. Serum cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL cholesterol levels were not affected by zinc supplementation in the study by Black et al. (1988). However, in another study, zinc supplements depressed HDL cholesterol levels and raised LDL chol esterol levels in elderly subjects (>60 years of age), especially in those who exercised. This study was not well controlled, and the wide variation in doses of the supplemented group prevented the determination of a LOAEL (Goodwin et al. 1985). Young women with a total daily intake of 1.6 mg zinc/kg/day in a 2-month study had a transient decrease in HDL cholesterol (Freeland-Graves et al. 1980). In a double-blind crossover study of young men and women receiving 2.0 (men) or 2.4 (women) mg zinc/kg/day for 6 weeks, total HDL cholesterol was not affected, and LDL cholesterol was significantly decreased in the women (Samman and Roberts 1988). No effect ZINC 61 3. HEALTH EFFECTS on HDL cholesterol was seen in elderly men and women (60-89 years old) with a total daily intake (dietary zinc plus a zinc acetate supplement) of 1. 5 mg/kg/day for 3 months (Bogden et al. 1988), but the subjects also received copper supplem ents (about 0.03 mg/kg). Bonham et al. (2003b) reported that supplementation of male subjects with 0.43 mg zinc/kg/day (30 mg/day, assuming a reference body weight of 70 kg), as zinc glycine chelate, had no e ffect on LDL, HDL, or triglyceride levels. Another study (Hale et al. 1988) reported no differences in triglycerides and cholesterol levels in subjects (68 years old) given zinc supplements of up to 2 mg/kg/day for an average of 8 years. No histopathology or rats receiving 191 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc acetate (Llobet et al. 1988a). Similarly, no histopathology was observed in rats administered 98.3 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide, but an insufficient number of animals were tested (Drinker et al. 1927c). Sheep fed time-weighted-ave rage doses of 19 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide for 49-72 days developed hepatic effects, including necrotic hepatocytes and large quantities of hemosiderin in Kupffer cells (Allen et al. 1983). Because sheep are ruminants, it is not known if they are a good model for predicting human toxicity. No histologi cal damage was observed in adult or young mink fed 327 or 324 mg zinc/kg/day, respectively, as zinc sulfate for 144 days (Aulerich et al. 1991). Decreased hexobarbital sleeping times were reported by Kadiiska et al. (1985) in rats receiving 40 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate. This physiological response suggested an induction of microsomal enzymes. Increases in serum cholesterol levels were observed in two studies where rats were fed either 2.8 or 10 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc acetate for 2-7 months (Katya-K atya et al. 1984; Klevay and Hyg 1973). Other studies have shown no effect on total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or serum triglyceride levels in rats ingesting 3 or 25 mg zinc/kg/day of unspecified zi nc compounds (Fischer et al. 1980; Woo et al. 1983). Renal Effects. Thirteen patients treated with zinc sulfate at 3.5 mg zinc/kg/day for 18 weeks for chronic venous leg ulcers had normal urinalyses (H allbook and Lanner 1972). However, neither the specific parameters measured for the urinalysis nor th e results were presented to support this conclusion. Furthermore, urinalysis may not be a sensitive indicator of renal function. A number of intermediate-duration st udies have demonstrated renal effects in animals exposed to zinc oxide, zinc sulfate, and zinc acetate. Zinc sulfate caused an increase in the absolute and relative kidney weights and regressive kidney lesions (not specified) in female mice that consumed 1,110 mg zinc/kg/day ZINC 62 3. HEALTH EFFECTS in the diet for 13 weeks, but no effects occurred in rats that consumed 565 mg zinc/kg/day or in mice that consumed 104 mg zinc/kg/day under similar conditions (Maita et al. 1981). Severe diffuse nephrosis was observed in ferrets exposed to 195 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide in the diet (Straube et al. 1980). In rats exposed to 191 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc acetate for 3 mo nths, epithelial cell damage in the glomerulus and proximal convoluted tubules and increased plasma creatin ine and urea levels were observed (Llobet et al. 1988a). The NOAEL for the effects on creatinine and urea was 95 mg zinc/kg/day. It is unclear whether the microscopic changes were observed at lower doses. No histopathological changes in the kidneys were observed in three rats that drank water containing 98.3 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide for 35-36 weeks (Drinker et al. 1927c); however, interpretation of the r esults of this study is severely limited by the small number of rats used. Renal tubular dilation, w ith proteinaceous casts and hemosiderin deposits, was observed in the kidneys of sheep that ingested 18 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide for 49-72 days (Allen et al. 1983). It is not known if sheep are a good model for human toxicity because they are ruminants. No renal effects were observed in either adult mink c onsuming 326.7 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate or in young mink consuming 323.6 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulf ate for 144 days (Aulerich et al. 1991). Minks exposed to 195 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide for 7 -97 days in the food developed a diffuse nephrosis, though it did not increase with increasing dose (Straube et al. 1980). Dermal Effects. No studies were located regarding dermal/ocular effects in humans after oral exposure to zinc. No dermal effects were seen in adult female minks given a time-weighted dose of 20.8 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate for 10 weeks prior to mating and then throughout gestation and lactation (Bleavins et al. 1983). However, the offspring of these animals showed graying of the fur around the eyes, ears, jaws, and genitals with a concomitant lo ss of hair and dermatosis in these areas during the weaning period. These conditions were reversible upon removal of treatment. Endocrine Effects. Only one human exposure study has evaluated endocrine effects of oral zinc exposure. Davis et al. (2000; Milne et al. 2001) re ported a slight (<10%) decrease in serum T4 levels in postmenopausal women exposed to 0.68 mg zinc/kg/da y as zinc gluconate; the difference did not attain statistical significance, and no changes in free T3 or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were reported. Piao et al. (2003) exposed groups of Wistar rats to 0, 4, or 8 mg zinc/kg as zinc acetate every other day for a 14-day period. Levels of T3 were decreased in both groups of exposed rats, relative to controls, but ZINC 63 3. HEALTH EFFECTS levels of T4 and TSH were not signi ficantly altered. Zinc exposure resulted in increased levels of serum cortisol, which was significant from controls at the 8 mg zinc/kg exposure level. Body Weight Effects. No effects on body weight have been reported in humans following oral exposure to zinc. However, a 46% decrease in body we ight gain was seen in preruminant calves that consumed 91 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide for 5 weeks; there was no effect at 64 mg zinc/kg/day (Jenkins and Hidiroglou 1991). The relevance of this effect to humans is unclear. Body weights of rabbits (Bentley and Grubb 1991), rats (Llobet et al. 1988a), and minks (Aulerich et al. 1991) were unaffected by dosing with 174, 191, and 326.7 mg zinc/kg/day, respectively, for 3-12 months. Decreased postpartum body weights in F0 animals were observed in rats e xposed to 7 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc chloride for 20 weeks (Khan et al. 2001b). 3.2.2.3 Immunological and Lymphoreticular Effects The highest NOAEL values and all LOAEL values fro m each reliable study for immunological and lymphoreticular effects in each species and duration cat egory are recorded in Table 3-2 and plotted in Figure 3-2. Zinc plays a role in the normal development and ma intenance of the immune system, such as in the lymphocyte response to mitogens and as a cofactor for the thymic hormone thymulin (Delafuente 1991; Fraker et al. 1986). Oral exposure to zinc at levels much higher than the RDA has impaired immune and inflammatory responses. This was observed in in vivo investigations of the immune competence of blood components taken from 11 healthy adult men after ing estion of 4.3 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate for 6 weeks. The mitogenic response elicited from peripheral blood lymphocytes and the chemotactic and phagocytic responses of polymorphonuc lear leukocytes were impaired after zinc ingestion. No effects were seen on total numbers of lymphocytes or relative numbers of T cells, T cell subsets, or B cells (Chandra 1984). The relationship between these ob servations and decreased levels of immune competence that might lead to increased susceptib ility to disease is unknown. Zinc supplements administered to elderly populations at doses up to 1. 5 mg zinc/kg/day (Bogden et al. 1988) or 2.5 mg zinc/kg/day (Duchateau et al. 1981) resulted in either no effect or a beneficial effect on immune cell titers or delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity responses to sp ecific antigens. A later study (Bonham et al. 2003) reported no effects of supplementation of male volunt eers with 30 mg zinc/day (0.43 mg zinc/kg/day assuming a reference male body weight of 70 kg) as zinc glycine chelate for 14 weeks on levels of peripheral blood leucocytes or on the frequency of lymphocyte subsets. ZINC 64 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Decreased lymphocyte activity (incorporation of 3H-thymidine in response to concanavalin A) was reported in mink kits from dams that had ingested a time-weighted-average dose of 20.8 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate for 10 weeks prior to conception and throughout gestation and lactation (Bleavins et al. 1983). The dose to the kits is unknown. In c ontrast, no effect was observed on antibody titre (immunoglobulin G [IgG] and immunoglobulin M [IgM]) or the mitogenic response of splenic B cells isolated from mice fed 76.9 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate for 4 weeks and challenged with B cell antigens either in vivo or in vitro (Schiffer et al. 1991). The in vitro mitogenic response of T cells isolated from these mice was increased . There was no effect of the zinc supplement in the plaque forming cell assay or on cytotoxic T killer cell activity in mice expo sed to 6.5 mg zinc/kg/day in the diet for 8 weeks (Fernandes et al. 1979). In mice exposed in utero to 136 mg zinc/kg/day, with exposure continuing postnatally, there were increases in direct plaque-fo rming activity of spleen cells and in lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogen stimulation (Lastra et al. 1997). 3.2.2.4 Neurological Effects Zinc appears to be necessary for normal brain function (Sandstead et al. 1983), but excess zinc is toxic. A 16-year-old boy who ingested 86 mg zinc/kg/day of metallic zinc ove r a 2-day period in an attempt to promote wound healing, developed signs and symptoms of lethargy, light-headedness, staggering, and difficulty in writing clearly (Murphy 1970). Lethar gy was also observed in a 2-year-old child who ingested a zinc chloride solution ( 1,000 mg zinc/kg) (Potter 1981). It is not known whether these observations represent direct effects on the nervous system. Very limited data were located rega rding neurological effects in animal s. Minor neuron degeneration and proliferation of oligodendroglia occu rred in rats dosed with 487 mg zi nc/kg/day as zinc oxide for 10 days (Kozik et al. 1980). Rats receiving 472 mg zinc/kg/day for 10 days had increased levels of secretory material in the neurosecretory nuclei of the hypothal amus (Kozik et al. 1981). Mice exposed postnatally to 0.5 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc acetate for 28 days show ed no changes in memory formation, but showed a gradual decrease in learning extinction throughout the study (de Oliveira et al. 2001). ZINC 65 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.2.2.5 Reproductive Effects The highest NOAEL values and all LOAEL values from each reliable study for reproductive effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 3-2 and plo tted in Figure 3-2. Pregnant women receiving capsules containing 0.3 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate during the last two trimesters did not exhibit any reproductive effects (no changes in maternal body weight gain, blood pressure, postpartum hemorrhage, or infection) (Ma homed et al. 1989). No other studies were located regarding reproductive effects in human s after oral exposure to zinc. No measurable effect on gestational length or litter size was observed when female mink ingested a time- weighted average dose of 20.8 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate (Bleavins et al. 1983). No histological alterations in the testes or ovaries were noted in mice fed zinc sulfate (1,110 mg zinc/kg/day) for 13 weeks (Maita et al. 1981). Male a nd female rats exposed by gavage to up to 14 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc chloride resulted in a nonsignificant decrease in fer tility index in all groups that was not related to administered dose; in the two highest groups (7 an d 14 mg zinc/kg/day), decreases in live pups per litter and pup weight at day 21 were also reported (Khan et al. 2001b). Similarly, exposure to up to 8 mg zinc/kg/day every other day for 14 days showed no eff ects on the levels of abnormal sperm in Wistar rats (Piao et al. 2003). Male and female rats receiving 50 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc carbonate in the diet were reported to reproduce normally for several generations in a poorly documented study by Sutton and Nelson (1937). Rats fed 250 mg zi nc/kg/day for 14-17 weeks mated successfully but had a higher than normal percentage of stillb orn pups. A subsequent mating of the parental generation fed 250 mg zinc/kg/day for 5 months was unsuccessful. No re production occurred in rats fed 500 mg zinc/kg/day for 5 months (Sutton and Nelson 1937). The frequency of sperm with an altered chromatin structure was increased in rats fed 25 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc chloride for 8 weeks (Evenson et al. 1993). Pre-implantation loss increased in rats fed diets contai ning 200 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate on gestational days 0-18 (Pal and Pal 1987). When the rats received 200 mg zinc/kg/day 21 days prior to mating, no effects on implantation or other adverse reproductiv e effects were observed (Pal and Pal 1987). Similarly, exposure of up to 372 mg zinc/kg/day in mice prior to and throughout pregnancy did not result in changes in reproductive index (Lastra et al. 1997). ZINC 66 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.2.2.6 Developmental Effects The highest NOAEL values and all LOAEL values from each reliable study for developmental effects in each species and duration category are recorded in Table 3-2 and plo tted in Figure 3-2. Zinc is necessary for normal fetal growth and de velopment. Fetal damage may result from zinc deficiency. Only one report in the literature sugg ested adverse developmental effects in humans due to exposure to excessive levels of zinc (Kumar 1976). F our women were given zinc supplements of 0.6 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate during the third trimeste r of pregnancy. Three of the women had premature deliveries, and one delivered a stillborn infant. Ho wever, the significance of these results cannot be determined because very few details were given rega rding the study protocol, reproductive histories, and the nutritional status of the women. Other human studies have found no deve lopmental effects in the newborns of mothers consuming 0.3 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate (Mahomed et al. 1989) or zinc citrate (Simmer et al. 1991) or 0.06 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc aspartate (Kynast and Saling 1986) during the last two trimesters. There has been a suggestion that increased serum zinc levels in pregnant women may be associated with an increase in neural tube defects (McMichael et al. 1994), bu t others have failed to confirm this association (Hambidge et al. 1993). The developmental toxicity of zinc in experime ntal animals has been evaluated in a number of investigations. Exposure to high levels of zinc in the diet prior to and/or during gestation has been associated with increased fetal resorp tions, reduced fetal weights, altere d tissue concentrations of fetal iron and copper, and reduced growth in the offspring. Administration of zinc in rats at 200 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide in the diet for 21 days prior to mating and then throughout gestation resulted in resorpti on of all fetuses (Schlicker and Cox 1968). Fetal resorptions ranged from 4 to 29% when 200 mg zinc/kg/day was administered only during gestation (controls had no resorptions). When the dose was reduced to 100 mg zinc/kg/day starting 21 days prior to mating, there were no fetal resorptions, malformati ons, or growth reduction. In contrast, Kinnamon (1963) reported no resorptions, no difference in the number of offspring per litter, and no change in average wet weight of the fetuses from female rats fe d 250 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc carbonate in the diet for 53 days before mating and during gestation. Th e reason for the differences in the results of these studies is unknown. No effect on fetal viability, size, or malformations was seen in fetuses from female rats fed 25 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc carbonate duri ng gestational days 1-18 (Uriu-Hare et al. 1989). ZINC 67 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Administration of 200 mg zinc/kg/day to dams thr oughout gestation resulted in decreased growth and tissue levels of copper and iron in fetal rats (Cox et al. 1969; Schlicker and Cox 1968). In rats, at both 100 and 200 mg/kg/day during gestational days 1-18, ma ternal zinc levels increased. However, zinc tissue levels in the 22-day-old fetuses were not elevated at 100 mg/kg/day to dams, suggesting that the placenta was able to act as a barrier to zinc at the lower dietary level. In contrast, Ketcheson et al. (1969) showed that newborn and 14-day-old rats from mothers that had consumed 100 mg/kg/day throughout gestation had elevated levels of total zinc and decrease d levels of iron. It is unclear whether the longer exposure to zinc during gestation or the suckling of newborn rats prior to sacrifice may have accounted for these differences. Animal studies suggest that exposure to very high leve ls of dietary zinc is associated with reduced fetal weight, alopecia, decreased hematocrit, and copper deficiency in offspring. For example, second generation mice exposed to zinc carbonate during gesta tion and lactation (260 mg/kg/day in the maternal diet), and then continued on that diet for 8 weeks, had reduced body weight, alopecia, and signs of copper deficiency (e.g., lowered hematocrit and occasional achrom otrichia [loss of hair color]) (Mulhern et al. 1986). Similarly, mink kits from dams that ing ested a time-weighted-average dose of 20.8 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate also had alopecia and achromotrichia (Bleavins et al. 1983). It is likely that the alopecia resulted from zinc-induced copper deficiency, which is known to cause alopecia in monkeys (Obeck 1978). However, no adverse effects were observed in parental mice or mink. No effects on reproduction were reported in rats exposed to 50 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc carbonate; however, increased stillbirths were observed in rats exposed to 250 mg zinc/kg/day (Sutton and Nelson 1937). 3.2.2.7 Cancer Leitzmann et al. (2003) reported on the occurrence of prostate cancer within a cohort of 46,974 men within the United States evaluated between 1986 a nd 2000. Within the cohort, 2,901 cases of prostate cancer were identified, 434 of which were classified as advanced cancer. Zinc supplementation did not appear to have an effect on the frequency of develo ping prostate cancer. However, men within the cohort who had taken supplements of 100 mg zinc/day had a greater pr obability of developing advanced cancer, if a tumor occurred. Other studies evaluating the possible carcinogenic effect s of zinc in humans are extremely limited. One study reported an association between an excess rate of gastric cancer in the people of North Wales (Great Britain) and the high zinc-to-copper ratio ( 30:1) in the soil of household gardens (Stocks and Davies ZINC 68 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 1964). However, the inference that th is excess in gastric cancer is causa lly associated with soil levels of zinc and copper is not consistent w ith another study. In a survey of cancer registry data (1954-1978) in Shipham, Somerset (Great Brita in), an area that also has a high soil zinc-to-copper ratio ( 17:1), the gastric cancer incidence rate was significantly lower th an the regional rate (Philipp et al. 1982). It is probable that other factors, not considered by Stocks and Davies (1964), are associated with or coincidental to the high soil zinc-to-copper ratio confounded the results. The carcinogenicity of zinc in experimental animals following oral exposure was evaluated by Walters and Roe (1965). The incidence of tumors was not increased in mice exposed to 951 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate in drinking water for 1 year compared to controls. However, impor tant details regarding the study protocol were lacking including the age and sex of the mice, the number of mice at the beginning of the study, the purity of the test material, and a co mplete list of the organs and tissues examined at necropsy. The control mice developed intercurrent disease (ectromelia), which resulted in a number of deaths; supplementary control mice were added to the study, but they were not concurrent controls. The number of animals in treated and control groups surv iving at 1 year (study termination) was small (22- 28 mice/group). The exposure period (1 year) was less than the standard bioassay period (18-24 months). There were no data in the study (e.g., survival or bo dy weight data) to indicate that a maximum tolerated dose was achieved. These limitations reduce the sensiti vity of the study by Walters and Roe (1965) to detect a carcinogenic response. Halme (1961) exposed tumor-resistant and tumor-susceptible strains of mice to zinc in drinking water. In a 5-generation study, groups of tumor-resistant mice (strain not specified) received 0, 10, 20, 50, 100, or 200 mg zinc/L as zinc chloride in the drinking water. The spontaneous tumor frequency for this strain of mice was 0.0004%. The tumor frequencies were reported as: F0=0.8%; F1=3.5%; F1 and F2=7.6%; and F3 and F4=25.7%. The majority of the tumors were seen in the 10- and 20-mg zinc dose groups. No individual or group tumor incidence data were reporte d, and a discussion of statistical analysis was not included. In the tumor-susceptible mice, strains C3H and A/Sn received 10-29 mg zinc/L in their drinking water for 2 years; 33/76 tumors were observed in the C3H strain (31 in females) and 24/74 tumors were observed in the A/Sn strain (20 in females). Most of the tumors were reported to be adenocarcinomas, but the tissues in which they occurred were not reported. The numbers of specific tumor types were not reported. The overall tumor fre quencies (43.4% for C3H and 32.4% for A/Sn) were higher than the spontaneous frequency (15% for each st rain), but statistical analyses were not reported. ZINC 69 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.2.3 Dermal Exposure 3.2.3.1 Death No studies were located regarding death in human s or animals after dermal exposure to zinc. 3.2.3.2 Systemic Effects The dermal toxicity of zinc compounds, particularly effects on the skin, can vary widely with the chemical form of zinc. For example, zinc chloride is caustic and can cause se vere irritation at levels <0.5 mg/cm2 (Lansdown 1991), while zinc sulfate is irritating but not as caustic as zinc chloride, and zinc oxide does not appear to be a dermal irritant. Zinc oxide is commonly used in topical applications (including sunblock products) without adverse effects. Zinc has been reported to promote the healing of burns and wounds when topically applied as zinc oxide or calamine lotion (Gordon et al. 1981). The mechanism by which this occurs was not discussed by the authors. Zinc oxide contained in an occlusive zinc tape dressing reduced the inflammatory reactions in the granulation tissue of wounded rats (Wetter et al. 1986). The authors speculated that zinc acted either by a continuous release of zinc ions or by m odifying components involved in the tape's adhesive properties. No studies were located regarding respiratory, cardi ovascular, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, hepatic, renal, or other systemic effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to zinc. The systemic effects observed after dermal exposure are discussed belo w.

HEALTH EFFECTS71 ZINC 72 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Dermal Effects. No signs of dermal irritation were observed in humans after a 25% zinc oxide patch (2.9 mg/cm2) was placed on the skin for 48 hours (Agren 1990). However, 14 out of 17 men who were employed in the bagging or packing of zinc oxide a nd whose skin was frequently covered with zinc oxide dust reported having experienced zinc oxide pox at least once (Turner 1921). The pox appeared as itchy papular-pustular eruptions in the pubic region, scrot um, inner surface of the thigh, and occasionally on the axilla and inner surface of the arms. The study author suggested that these lesions were due to clogging of glands by dust, perspiration, and bacteria when skin surfaces coated with these substances were rubbed together. In contrast, a case study of 24 workers expo sed to dusts of either zinc oxide, zinc sulfide, or metallic zinc revealed only 1 worker with papular pustular lesions on the axilla and inner thighs (Batchelor et al. 1926). The difference in the results was attributed to differences in the personal hygiene of the workers in the two studies. The dermal irritancy of several zinc compounds was compared in mice, rabbits, and guinea pigs (Lansdown 1991). Of the six zinc compounds tested, zinc chloride had the greatest irritancy potential (severe irritation at 0.48 mg/cm 2), followed by zinc acetate (moderate irritation at 7.2 mg/cm2) and zinc sulfate (slight irritation at 0.48 mg/cm2); no signs of irritation were ob served following exposure to zinc oxide. Although zinc chloride is clearly the most irri tating, the relative irritancy of zinc sulfate and zinc acetate was not determined because only one dose was tested and a different dose was used for each compound. The severe skin irritancy observed following application of zinc chloride was characterized by parakeratosis, hyperkeratosis, inflammatory chan ges in the epidermis and superficial and acanthosis of the follicular epithelia (Lansdown 1991). Ocular Effects. In a case report, accidental splashing of a soldering paste containing 30% zinc chloride into the eye of a plumber produced an immediate reduction in visual acuity, hyperemia, hemorrhaging, conjunctival swelling, corneal opacity , bullous keratopathy, and spotting of the lens (Houle and Grant 1973). Most symptoms disappeared after 6 weeks, but residual lens opacities persisted for over a year after the exposure. Reddened conjun ctivae and lacrimation were observed in 34 persons who were exposed to extremely high concentrations of zinc chloride smoke when several smoke generators exploded in a tunnel during World War II (Evans 1945). Two of the exposed persons had corneal burns and four had small vesicular burns on the forehead or wrist. Zinc chloride was the major component of the smoke. However, other component s such as zinc oxide, hexachloroethane, calcium silicide, the igniter, or the heat of the explosion ma y have contributed to the injuries that were observed. ZINC 73 3. HEALTH EFFECTS No studies were located regarding the following hea lth effects in humans or animals after dermal exposure to zinc: 3.2.3.3 Immunological and Lymphoreticular Effects Effects 3.2.3.6 Developmental Effects 3.2.3.7 Cancer 3.3 GENOTOXICITY Genotoxicity studies conducted in a variety of test systems have failed to provide evidence for mutagenicity of zinc. However, there are indications of weak clastogenic effects following zinc exposure. Chromosome aberrations were observed in the lym phocytes of 24 workers in a zinc smelting plant (Bauchinger et al. 1976). However, the workers had increased blood levels of lead and cadmium, and the clastogenic effect was attributed to cadmium exposure. Results of in vivo studies are shown in Table 3-4. A dominant lethal study in mice failed to show a mutagenic potential for zinc. However, chromosoma l aberrations have been observed in bone marrow cells following in vivo exposure to zinc (Vilkina et al. 1978). Th is effect was observed in rats exposed to 14.8 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc chlorate in drinking water (Kowalska-Wochna et al. 1988), mice given intraperitoneal injections of 3.6 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc chloride (Gupta et al. 1991), and mice exposed to zinc oxide by inhalation (Voroshilin et al. 1978) . Chromosomal aberrations caused by zinc were observed in the bone marrow cells of mice maintained on a low-calcium diet (Deknudt and Gerber 1979). Calcium may be displaced by zinc in calcium-deplete d conditions, leading to chromosome breaks and/or interfering in the repair process (Deknudt and Gerber 1979). In vivo exposure to zinc may also result in single-strand breaks, as measured by the Comet assay in mice (Banu et al. 2001). An increased incidence of sister chromatid exchange was observed in bone marrow cells of rats exposed to 17.5 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc chlorate in drinking water (Kowalska-Wochna et al. 1988).

HEALTH EFFECTS Results of in vitro studies are shown in Table 3-5. Exposure to zinc as zinc sulfate or zinc chloride does not increase mutation frequencies in bacterial or mammalian cell culture test systems (Amacher and Paillet 1980; 1989; Venitt and Levy 1974; Wong 1988). Similarly, there w as no convincing evidence of a clastogenic effect in human lymphocytes exposed to 0.0003-0.00003 M zinc chloride (Deknudt and Deminatti 1978). 3.4 TOXICOKINETICS There is limited information on the toxicokinetic properties of zinc following inhalation or dermal exposure. Increased zinc levels in the blood and urine of humans and in the tissue of animals after inhalation and dermal exposure to zinc, respectively, i ndicate that zinc is absorbed by these routes. The toxicokinetic properties of ingested zinc have been extensively studied. The absorption of zinc from the gastrointestinal tract is homeostatically regulat ed; under normal physiological conditions, 20-30% of ingested zinc is absorbed. Zinc uptake from the in testinal lumen involves passive diffusion and a carrier- mediated process. A number of factors influence the absorption of zinc; these incl ude the solubility of the zinc compound as well as inhibitors, such as calcium, phosphorus, and dietary fiber and phytates (components of dietary fiber that may coprecipitate w ith zinc in the intestines), and enhancers, such as amino acids, picolinic acid, and prostaglandin E 2. Once absorbed, zinc is widely distributed throughout the body. Zinc content is highest in muscle, bone, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, brain, skin, lung, heart, and pancreas. In plasma, two-thirds of the zinc is bound to albumin which represents the metabolically active pool of zinc. This pool of plasma zinc is frequently referred to as loosely bound zinc because albumin has the ability to give up bound zinc to ti ssues. Zinc is excreted in both urine and feces. 3.4.1 Absorption 3.4.1.1 Inhalation Exposure Quantitative studies regarding absorption of zinc and zinc compounds after inhalation exposure in humans are limited. The absorption of inhaled zinc depends on the particle size and solubility, both of which may greatly influence the deposition and clearance of zinc aerosols, particularly insoluble zinc oxide (a review of the role of particle size in the deposition of particles is found in Witschi and Last 2001). Elevated levels of zinc have been found in the blood and urine of workers exposed to zinc oxide fumes (Hamdi 1969). ZINC 76 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Table 3-5.

HEALTH EFFECTS The rates or percentages of absorption of inhaled zinc in animals are not available; however, studies provide data on zinc retention in the lungs. Zinc re tention values were 19.8, 11.5, and 4.7% in the lungs of guinea pigs, rats, and rabbits, respectively, af ter inhalation exposure (nose-only) to 3.5-9.1 mg zinc/m3 as zinc oxide aerosol for 2-3 hours (Gordon et al. 1992). The aerosol had a mass median diameter of 0.17 \u00b5m. The retention of zinc in lungs was dose related in male Wistar rats administered a single intratracheal instillation of 0.07-3.7 mg zinc/m3 as zinc oxide (Hirano et al. 1989). A half-life of 14 hours was calculated. The absorption of zinc oxide fumes lead to increased levels of zinc measured in the liver, kidney, and pancreas of cats exposed to zinc oxide fumes for durations ranging from 15 minutes to 3.25 hours (Drinker and Drinker 1928). The usefulness of the study is limited because reporting was inadequate and particle size of the zinc oxide aerosol was not dete rmined. Some inhaled particles of zinc oxide are subject to ciliary clearance and swallowing. Thus, a portion of the inhaled zinc may ultimately be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. 3.4.1.2 Oral Exposure Several studies have measured oral absorption rates of zinc in humans. Absorption ranged from 8 to 81% following short-term exposures to zinc supplements in the diet; differences in absorption are probably due to the type of diet (amount of zinc ingested, amount and kind of food eaten) (Aamodt et al. 1983; Hunt et al. 1991; Istfan et al. 1983; 1992). For example, dietary protein facilitates zinc absorption; fractional zinc absorption ranged from 8% for low-protei n rolls to 26% for high-protein rolls 3 days after individuals ingested 0.05 mg zinc/kg (Hunt et al. 1991). Absorption of labeled zinc was 40.0-48.4% in male Wistar rats fed a diet containing 0.81 mg zinc/kg as zinc chloride or zinc carbonate (Galvez-Morros et al . 1992). Fractional absorption in immature organisms generally exceeds that in adults. In growing ra ts, on the basis of indirect calculation from isotope experiments, Weigand and Kirchgessner (1992) suggest ed surprisingly high absorption values of as much as 94.7%. It is likely that all these results were influenced by isotope exchange and do not provide estimates of net absorption. The body's natural homeostatic mechanisms control zinc absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (Davies 1980). Persons with adequate nutritional levels of zinc abso rb approximately 20-30% of all ZINC 78 3. HEALTH EFFECTS ingested zinc. Those who are zinc-deficient absorb greater proportions of administered zinc (Johnson et al. 1988; Spencer et al. 1985). Absorption of zinc occurs from all segments of the intestine, although the largest proportion of zinc absorption occurs from the duodenum (Methfessel a nd Spencer 1973). The zinc absorption process includes both passive diffusion and a carrier-mediate d process (Tacnet et al. 1990). The intestinal absorption of zinc appears to be a saturable carrier-mediated process at low zinc dose levels involving a cysteine-rich intestinal protein (CRIP) (Davies 1980; Gunshin et al. 1991; Hempe and Cousins 1992; Sturniolo et al. 1991). This protein binds zinc en tering the intestinal cells from the lumen (Hempe and Cousins 1991). CRIP has a limited binding capacity for zinc and becomes saturated when zinc concentration in the intestine is high. Metallothione in, a metal-binding protein, may contribute to zinc homeostasis at higher zinc absorption. Like sever al other metals, zinc can induce metallothionein production in intestinal mucosal cells (Richards and C ousins 1975). Zinc binds to metallothionein, which remains in the mucosal cells lining the gastrointestin al tract, and the bound metal is excreted from the body upon sloughing off of these cells. Although the affinity of zinc for metallothionein is relatively low, the protein may serve to prevent absorption of ex cess zinc in the body (Foulkes and McMullen 1987). Absorption of zinc in rats is increased when metalloth ionein levels are lower (Fla nagan et al. 1983). It is hypothesized that zinc entering luminal cells is asso ciated with CRIP, and a small amount is bound to metallothionein; however, as the luminal zinc concentration increases, the proportion of cytosolic zinc associated with CRIP is decreased with a concomitant increase in zinc binding to metallothionein (Hempe and Cousins 1992). Further details on the influence of CRIP and metallothionein on zinc absorption are provided in Section 3.5, Mechanisms of Action. Phytate and high phosphorus intakes in animals decrease zinc absorption. In humans, dairy products that contain both calcium and phosphorus decrease zinc absorptio n and plasma zinc concentration (Pecoud et al. 1975). Zinc binds to phosphate which results in coprecipitation of zinc with calcium phosphate in the intestines (Nelson et al. 1985). Dietary phytate also reduces zinc absorption. The addition of 400 \u00b5mol phytate to the diet decreased zinc absorption from 43.3\u00b117.9% in females fed bread containing 0.02 mg zinc/kg (zinc-65 isotope) to 14.3\u00b13.2% (Sandstrom and Sandberg supplemented with radiolabeled zinc and phytate excreted significantly more zinc in the feces than rats given diets supplemented with radiolabeled zinc but without phytate (Davies and Nightingale 1975). The study authors suggested that the decrease in absorption was due to the forma tion of zinc-phytate complexes in the intestines. Phytate also reduced reabsorption of zinc secreted into the gastrointestinal tract of humans (Sandstrom and Sandberg 1992). ZINC 79 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Endogenous substances, such as amino acids, can influe nce the absorption of zinc. Complexing of zinc with amino acids generally enhances its absorption in all segments of the intestine (Wapnir and Stiel 1986). Although neither zinc nor the amino acid proline are readily absorbed in the colon, complexing of zinc with proline during an in vivo intestinal perfusion in rats resu lted in increased zinc absorption. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a metabolic disorder th at results in the malabsorption of zinc. However, when patients afflicted with this disorder were tr eated with human milk, zinc absorption was enhanced (Lombeck et al. 1975). It was reported by Evans ( 1980) that patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica have an impaired tryptophan metabolic pathway. Picolinic acid, a chief metabolite of tryptophan, is also a constituent of human milk. Picolinic acid is secreted by the pancreas into the intestinal lumen. A study by Boosalis et al. (1983) demonstrated that patients with pancreatic insufficien cy had difficulty absorbing zinc administered as zinc sulfate. However, when these pancreatic-insufficient patients were given zinc as zinc picolinate, the extent of zinc absorption was similar to that of healthy controls. Zinc absorption may depend on the bioavailability of picolinic acid. Su ch a mandatory role of picolinic acid in absorption has not been confirmed (Bonewitz et al. 1982). The addition of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) to the mucosal media of everted jejunal sacs from rats significantly increased zinc transport (Song and Adham 1979). In contrast, similar addition of prostaglandin F 2 (PGF 2) significantly decreased zinc transport. Addition of PGF 2 to the serosal side of the jejunal sacs increased the transport of zinc to the mucosal side; PGE 2 decreased the serosal to mucosal transport of zinc. The mechanism by which pros taglandins regulate zinc transport has not been established (Song et al. 1992). The limitation of the in vitro study is the absence of vascular perfusion and consequent trapping of metals in the submucosal tissue. Hence, studies of absorption of heavy metals, including zinc, in everted sacs have limited physiological relevance (Foulkes 1984) but may provide information useful for the design of future in vivo experiments. The presence of other trace metals (e.g., mercury, cadmium, copper) may also diminish zinc transport. Section 3.9 provides detailed information on th e interaction of zinc with other metals. 3.4.1.3 Dermal Exposure Dermal absorption of zinc occurs, but its mechanism is not clearly defined. Studies are very limited regarding the absorption of zinc through the skin. Historically, zinc oxide has been used clinically to ZINC 80 3. HEALTH EFFECTS promote the healing of burns and wounds (Gordon et al. 1981). Absorption has been observed in burn patients treated with gauze dressings containing zinc oxide (Hallmans 1977). The pH of the skin, the amount of zinc applied, and the vehicle administered with zinc all affect the absorption of zinc (Agren 1990, 1991). Zinc chloride was also absorbed through the intact sk in of the rat (Keen and Hurl ey 1977). Absorption of zinc sulfate was greater than zinc oxide followi ng 4-48-hour dermal applica tion to open rats (Agren et al. 1991). About 12% of zinc oxide (0.25 mg zinc/cm2) from the dressing reached the wound while 65% of zinc sulfate (0.066 mg zinc/cm2) reached the wound. The data suggest that zinc oxide applied to wounds resulted in sust ained delivery of zinc ions causing constant wound- tissue zinc levels. In contrast, zinc sulfate, bei ng more water soluble than zinc oxide, is rapidly transferred into the blood and, therefore, caused decr eased wound-tissue zinc levels (Agren et al. 1991). 3.4.2 Distribution Zinc is one of the most abundant trace metals in hum ans. It is found normally in all tissues and tissue fluids and is a cofactor in over 300 enzyme system s. Together, muscle and bone contain approximately 90% of the total amount of zinc in the body ( 60 and 30%, respectively) (Wastney et al. 1986). Organs containing sizable concentrations of zinc are the liver , gastrointestinal tract, kidney, skin, lung, brain, heart, and pancreas (Bentley and Grubb 1991; Drinker and Drinker 1928; He et al. 1991; Llobet et al. 1988a). High concentrations of zinc were also detected in the prostate (Forssen 1972), retina, and sperm (Bentley and Grubb 1991). Zinc levels may vary cons iderably from one individual to another (Forssen 1972). To some degree, the distribution of zinc in some tissu es appears to be regulated by age (Schroeder et al. 1967). Zinc concentrations increase in the liver, pancreas, and prostate and decrease in the uterus and aorta with age. Levels in the kidneys and heart peak at approximately 40-50 years of age and then decline. Zinc is present in blood plasma, erythrocytes, leukocyt es, and platelets, but is chiefly localized within erythrocytes (of which 87% is in carbonic anhydrase, the major binding site) (Ohno et al. 1985). Zinc deficiency has been demonstrated to decrease th e ability of erythrocytes to resist hemolysis in vitro . This finding suggests that zinc stabilizes the erythrocyte membrane. In plasma, two-thirds of the zinc is bound to albumin; the remainder is bound primarily to 2-macroglobulin (Bentley and Grubb 1991; Giroux et al. ZINC 81 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 1976; Wastney et al. 1986). It appears that the limited number of binding sites for zinc in plasma albumin and macroglobulin regulates the amount of zinc retained by the body (Andermann and Dietz 1982). Albumin-bound zinc has been correlated with plasma zinc levels, whereas 2-macroglobulin shows no correlation with plasma zinc levels. Hormones, such as the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), appear to regulate the concentration of zinc in the liver. ACTH, secreted by the corticoids. Glucocorticoids, or hormones with glucocorticoid activity, have been shown in vitro to stimulate the net zinc uptake in cultured liver cells and at the same time activate the gene that regulates metallothionein synthesis (Failla and Cousins 1978). However, there are no in vivo data to support these in vitro findings. Metallothionein in the cells of the intestinal mucosa binds zinc, thus regulating its release into the blood. The transfer of zinc across perfused placentas is slow; only 3% of maternal zinc reached the fetal compartment in 2 hours (Beer et al. 1992). The in vitro transfer of zinc between mother and fetus is bidirectional, with binding in the placenta (Beer et al. 1992). It is proposed that zinc uptake in the placenta involves a potassium/zinc transport system (Aslam and McArdle 1992). Newborns may also be exposed to zinc from their mothers by milk transfer of zinc during lactation (Rossowska and Nakamoto 1992). 3.4.2.1 Inhalation Exposure No studies were located regarding distribution in humans after inhalation exposure to zinc. However, occupational studies provided indirect evidence that zi nc may distribute to tissues to produce systemic effects (Brown 1988; Drinker et al. 1927a; Malo al. 1926; Rohrs 1957; Sturgis et al. 1927). Zinc levels in the lungs of cats peaked immediately after acute exposure to 12-61 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxide for approximately 3 hours and remained high fo r 2 days postexposure, then dropped significantly thereafter (Drinker and Drinker 1928). Levels in pancreas, liver, and kidneys increased slowly. ZINC 82 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.4.2.2 Oral Exposure A single oral dose of 0.7 mg zinc/kg as zinc sulfate given to 11 individuals resulted in peak zinc levels in the plasma at 2-3 hours (Statter et al. 1988; Sturniolo et al. 1991). Similarly, Neve et al. (1991) reported peak serum zinc concentration at 2.3 hour s with 0.7 mg zinc/kg as zinc sulfate. Following feeding of 191 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc acetate to rats for 3 months, increased zinc levels were significant in the heart, spleen, kidneys, liver, bone, and blood (Llobet et al. 1988a). The greatest increases were in bone (258% of the co ntrol value) and blood (520% of th e control value). Elevated zinc levels were found in the kidneys and liver of mice fed 76.9 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate (Schiffer et al. 1991) or 38 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc nitrate (Cooke et al. 1990) for approximately 1 month. The kidneys and pancreas had higher zinc levels than the liver and carcass of rats fed diets containing 1.1 mg/kg/day for an unspecified duration (Weigand and Kirc hgessner 1992). Newborn, young, and adult mice receiving a single oral dose of 4.6 mg zinc/kg as zinc chloride generally had the highest levels of zinc in the liver, kidneys, lungs, bone, muscle, and carcass 1 day after dosing (He et al. 1991). However, the amount of zinc in the lungs, muscle, and femur decreased with age. 3.4.2.3 Dermal Exposure No studies were located regarding distribution in humans after dermal exposure to zinc. Animal data on the distribution of zinc following dermal exposure are limited. Elevated serum zinc levels occurred with the application of zinc oxide or zinc sulfate to skin wounds of Sprague-Dawley rats for 4- 48 hours (Agren et al. 1991). Serum zinc level peaked at 4 hours in rats treated with zinc sulfate, while levels were slightly elevated for 48 hours in rats administered zinc oxide. The differences may be attributed to the absorbability of the zinc compounds. 3.4.3 Metabolism Plasma provides a metabolically active transport comp artment for zinc (Cousins 1985). Zinc is most often complexed to organic ligands (existing in loosely or firmly bound fractions) rather than free in solution as metallic ion (Gordon et al. 1981). Zinc is found in diffusible or nondiffusible forms in the blood (NAS/NRC 1979). In the diffusible form, approximately two-thirds of plasma zinc is freely ZINC 83 3. HEALTH EFFECTS exchangeable and loosely bound to albumin (Cousins 1985); the zinc-albumin complex has an association constant of about 106 (NAS/NRC 1979). The diffusible form of zinc also includes zinc bound to amino acids (primarily histidine and cysteine). The zinc-a lbumin complex is in equilibrium with the zinc-amino acid complex (Henkin 1974). The zinc-amino acid co mplex can be transported passively across tissue membranes to bind to proteins. An important binding protein in the kidney and liver is metallothionein, although other tissue-binding proteins may be present. In the nondiffusible form, a small amount of circulating zinc is tightly bound to 2-macroglobulin in the plasma (Cousins 1985). Zinc is inco rporated into and dissociated from 2-macroglobulin only in the liver (Henkin 1974). This zinc-protein complex has an association constant of >1,010 (Henkin 1974; NAS/NRC 1979). The zinc bound to 2-macroglobulin is not freely exchangeable with other zinc ligands (i.e., zinc-albumin and zinc-amino acid complexes) in serum. 3.4.4 Elimination and Excretion 3.4.4.1 Inhalation Exposure Information was limited regarding zinc excretion following inhalation exposure in humans. Workers exposed to zinc oxide fumes had elevated levels of zi nc in the urine (Hamdi 1969) indicating that this is a route of excretion. No studies were located regarding excretion in animals after inhalation exposure to zinc. 3.4.4.2 Oral Exposure The principal route of excretion of ingested zinc in humans is through the intestine (Davies and Nightingale 1975; Reinhold et al. 1991; Wastney et al. 1986). Zinc loss in the body is by secretion via the gut, and the remainder occurs in the urine (Wastney et al. 1986). Fecal excretion of zinc increases as intake increases (Spencer et al. 1985). Excretion of zi nc in the urine also reflects zinc intake (Wastney et al. 1986). Minor routes of elimination are saliva secre tion, hair loss, and sweat (Greger and Sickles et al. 1975a; Prasad et al. 1963a; Rivlin 1983). There was a linear increase in fecal excretion of zi nc in proportion to dietary intake in rats fed supplementations of 32 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc oxi de for 7-42 days (Ansari et al. 1975) or 50- ZINC 84 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 339 mg/kg/day for 21 days (Ansari et al. 1976). No differences in fecal excretion, total excretion, or retention of zinc were found among ra ts given diets containing different forms of zinc (Seal and Heaton 1983). Rats receiving 2.65 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc chloride, zinc sulfate, zinc phosphate, or zinc citrate, over a 4-day period excreted 87-98% of intake. A study by Alexander et al. (1981) demonstrated that zinc is excreted in the bile of rats. Analysis of the bile indicated that the zinc is primarily complexed with reduced glutathione. Treatment of these rats with diethylmaleate, which conjugates with reduced glutat hione and restricts its availability, depressed the biliary excretion of zinc. This depression confirms a relationship between zinc and glutathione and suggests that zinc is transferred from liver to bile by a glutathione-dependent process. Other factors may affect zinc excretion. For exampl e, low dietary intake of zinc or malnutrition can increase the urinary excretion of zinc. This release of zinc is a result of tissue breakdown and catabolism during starvation; and elevated urinary excretion of zi nc may persist after intake levels return to normal (Spencer et al. 1976). Administration of histid ine or high-protein diet may increase urinary zinc excretion; however, a corresponding increase in zinc absorption may maintain zinc balance in the body (Henkin et al. 1975b; Hunt et al. 1991). 3.4.4.3 Dermal Exposure No studies were located regarding excretion in hum ans or animals after dermal exposure to zinc. 3.4.5 Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models use mathematical descriptions of the uptake and disposition of chemical substances to quantitatively describe the relationships among critical biological processes (Krishnan et al. 1994). PBPK models are also called biologically based tissue dosimetry models. PBPK models are increasingly used in risk a ssessments, primarily to predict the concentration of potentially toxic moieties of a chemical that will be delivered to any given target tissue following various combinations of route, dose level, and test species (Clewell and Andersen 1985). Physiologically based pharmacodynamic (PBPD) models use mathematical descriptions of the dose-response function to quantitatively describe the relationship between target tissue dose and toxic end points. ZINC 85 3. HEALTH EFFECTS PBPK/PD models refine our unde rstanding of complex quantitativ e dose behaviors by helping to delineate and characterize the relationships between: (1) the external/exposure concentration and target tissue dose of the toxic moiety, and (2) the targ et tissue dose and observed responses (Andersen and Krishnan 1994; Andersen et al. 1987). These models are biologically and mechanistically based and can be used to extrapolate the pharmacokinetic behavior of chemical substances from high to low dose, from route to route, between species, and between subpopul ations within a species. The biological basis of PBPK models results in more meaningful extrapolati ons than those generated with the more conventional use of uncertainty factors. The PBPK model for a chemical substance is deve loped in four interconnected steps: (1) model representation, (2) model parametrization, (3) model simulation, and (4) model validation (Krishnan and Andersen 1994). In the early 1990s, validated PBPK models were deve loped for a number of toxicologically important chemical substances, bot h volatile and nonvolatile (Krishnan and Andersen 1994; Leung 1993). PBPK models for a particular subs tance require estimates of the chemical substance- specific physicochemical parameters, and species-specif ic physiological and biological parameters. The numerical estimates of these model parameters are incorporated within a set of differential and algebraic equations that describe the pharmacokinetic processes. Solving these differential and algebraic equations provides the predictions of tissue dose. Computer s then provide process simulations based on these solutions. The structure and mathematical expressions used in PBPK models significantly simplify the true complexities of biological systems. If the uptake and disposition of the chemical substance(s) are adequately described, however, this simplification is desirable because data are often unavailable for many biological processes. A simplified scheme reduces the magnitude of cumulative uncertainty. The adequacy of the model is, therefore, of great impor tance, and model validation is essential to the use of PBPK models in risk assessment. PBPK models improve the pharmacoki netic extrapolations used in ri sk assessments that identify the maximal (i.e., the safe) levels for human exposure to chemical substances (Andersen and Krishnan 1994). PBPK models provide a scientifically sound means to predict the target tissu e dose of chemicals in humans who are exposed to environmental levels (for example, levels that might occur at hazardous waste sites) based on the results of studies where doses were higher or were administered in different species.

The chemical substance is shown to be absorbed via the skin, by inhalation, or by ingestion, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in the urine or by exhalation. ZINC 87 3. HEALTH EFFECTS If PBPK models for zinc exist, the overall results a nd individual models are discussed in this section in terms of their use in risk assessment, tissue dosimet ry, and dose, route, and species extrapolations. Validated PBPK models for zinc in anim als or humans are not presently available. 3.5 MECHANISMS OF ACTION 3.5.1 Pharmacokinetic Mechanisms The absorption of zinc from the intestine is homeosta tically controlled. A study by Hempe and Cousins (1992) found that CRIP, a diffusible intracellular zinc carrier, binds zinc in the mucosa during absorption; this process appears to be saturable (Gunshin et al. 1991; Hempe and Cousins 1992; Sturniolo et al. 1991). Zinc transport in the intestinal lumen is also influenced by metallothionein which can inhibit zinc absorption by competing with CRIP for zinc (Hem pe and Cousins 1992). CRIP binds about 40% of radiolabeled zinc entering the intestinal cells from th e lumen in ligated loops of the small intestine of anesthetized rats when the zi nc concentration is low (5 \u00b5M), but only 14% of the radiolabel when the concentration is high (300 \u00b5M) (Hempe and Cousins 1991). These findings suggest that CRIP has a limited binding capacity for zinc and becomes saturated when zinc concentration in the intestine is high (Hempe and Cousins 1992). High luminal zinc concentrations may damage the br ush border membrane, allowing zinc to enter the cell and bind nonspecifically to cell proteins and other ligands (Cousins 1985; Hempe and Cousins 1992). Within the intestinal lumen, a number of factors appear to influence the availability of zinc for absorption. Methionine, histidine, cysteine, reduced glutathione, citrate, and prostaglandin E 2 increase the intestinal uptake of zinc (Song et al. 1992), whereas inorganic inhibitors of zinc absorption include cadmium, copper, calcium, and ferrous iron (Hamilton et al. 19 78; Harford and Sarkar 1991; Ogiso et al. 1979; et al. 1993). The mech anism of inhibition has not been clearly elucidated, but it is believed to involve competition for zinc bindi ng sites in the intestinal mucosal cells; an effect on charge distribution on the mucosal membrane has al so been suggested (Foulkes 1985). The organic inhibitors, including phytate and some components of di etary fiber, are believed to complex with zinc and decrease its availability. In the mucosal cell, zi nc is associated with metalloproteins, including metallothionein. The release of zinc from the intracel lular protein ligands and its transfer to the blood may involve diffusion of complexes with glut athione and similar compounds (Foulkes 1993). ZINC 88 3. HEALTH EFFECTS In the plasma, albumin is the primary carrier for zinc, with smaller amounts of zinc bound to 2-macroglobulin and amino acids (Giroux et al. 19 76). The albumin-bound zinc represents the metabolically active pool of zinc. Zinc is loosel y bound in plasma, and albumin-bound zinc can readily be given up to tissues; however, the mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Zinc is initially concentrated in the liver after ingestion, and is subsequently distri buted throughout the body. The liver, pancreas, bone, kidney, and muscle are the major tissue storage sites. When plasma zinc levels are high, liver metallothionein synthesis is stimulated, which facilita tes the retention of zinc by hepatocytes (Richards and Cousins 1975). A storage form of zinc has not been identified in soft tissues, with the possible exception of zinc metallothionein. Zinc in bone is relatively unavailable for use by other tissues. 3.5.2 Mechanisms of Toxicity Metal fume fever is the primary effect observed in wo rkers exposed to zinc oxide fumes or dust (Blanc et al. 1991; Brown 1988; Drinker et al. 1927b; Vogelmeier et al. 1987). Metal fume fever usually occurs 3- 10 hours after exposure, and the symptoms persist for 24-48 hours. The exact pathogenesis of metal fume fever is not known. It is believed to be an immune response to the inhaled zinc oxide (Mueller and Seger 1985). It has been suggested that the zinc oxi de causes inflammation of the respiratory tract and the release of histamine or histamine-like substances. In response, an allergen-antibody complex is formed that may elicit an allergic reaction upon subse quent exposure to the allergen. In response to the allergen-antibody complex, an anti-antibody is fo rmed. The anti-antibody dominates with continued exposure to the zinc oxide, thereby producing a tole rance. When the exposure is interrupted and re-exposure occurs, the allergen-antibody comple x dominates, producing an allergic reaction and symptoms of metal fume fever (McCord 1960). Oral exposure to high levels of zinc has caused anemia, decreased levels of HDL cholesterol, and pancreatic damage in humans (Black et al. 1988; Chandra 1984; Chobanian 1981; Hooper et al. animals (Allen et al. 1983; Aughey et al. 1977; Drinker et al. 1981; Straube et al. 1980). The mechanisms involved in the pancreatic damage have not been elucidated. Th e anemia and possibly the decreased HDL cholesterol levels are thought to be caused by a zinc-induced c opper deficiency, although the levels at which this occur have not been well-characterized. Although it is generally accepted that the anemia is the result of copper deficiency, the relationship between zinc and copper levels and HDL cholesterol levels has been extensively debated (Fischer et al. 1980; Katya-Katya et al. 1984; Klevay and Hyg 1973; Murthy Petering 1976). ZINC 89 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.6 TOXICITIES MEDIATED THROUGH THE NEUROENDOCRINE AXIS Recently, attention has focused on th e potential hazardous effects of certain chemicals on the endocrine system because of the ability of these chemicals to mimic or block endogenous hormones. Chemicals with this type of activity are most commonly referred to as endocrine disruptors. However, appropriate terminology to describe such effects re mains controversial. The terminology endocrine disruptors, initially used by Colborn and Clement (1992), was al so used in 1996 when Congress mandated the EPA to develop a screening program for \"...certain substances [which] may have an effect produced by a naturally occurring estrogen, or other such endocrine effect[s]...\". To meet th is mandate, EPA convened a panel called the Endocrine Disruptors Screening a nd Testing Advisory Committee (EDSTAC), and in 1998, the EDSTAC completed its deliberations and made recommendations to EPA concerning endocrine disruptors. In 1999, the National Academy of Sciences released a report that referred to these same types of chemicals as hormonally active agents. The terminology endocrine modulators has also been used to convey the fact that effects caused by such chemic als may not necessarily be adverse. Many scientists agree that chemicals with the ability to disrupt or modulate the endocrine system are a potential threat to the health of humans, aquatic animals, and wildlif e. However, others think that endocrine-active chemicals do not pose a significant health risk, particular ly in view of the fact that hormone mimics exist in the natural environment. Examples of natura l hormone mimics are the isoflavinoid phytoestrogens (Adlercreutz 1995; Livingston 1978; Mayr et al. 1992). These chemicals are derived from plants and are similar in structure and action to endogenous estrogen. Although the public health significance and descriptive terminology of substances capable of affecting the endocrine system remains controversial, scientists agree that these chemicals may affect the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones in the body respons ible for maintaining homeostasis, reproduction, development, and/or behavior (EPA 1997). Stated differently, such compounds may cause toxicities that are mediated through the neuroendocrine axis. As a result, these chemicals may play a role in altering, for example, metabolic, sexual, immune, and neurobehav ioral function. Such chemicals are also thought to be involved in inducing breast, testicular, and pr ostate cancers, as well as endometriosis (Berger 1994; Giwercman et al. 1993; Hoel et al. 1992). No in vitro studies were located regarding endocrine disruption of zinc. Pancreas. Increased levels of serum amylase were observed in a man after accidental ingestion of about 3 ounces of a zinc chloride solution (Chobanian 1981) . A 16-year-old boy who ingested an average of ZINC 90 3. HEALTH EFFECTS approximately 86 mg zinc/kg/day as metallic zinc for 2 days (114 mg/kg on the 1st day and 57 mg/kg on the 2nd day) had increased serum amylase and lipase (Murphy 1970). In humans receiving a single low dose of zinc sulfate (0.5 mg zinc/kg/day), no changes in blood glucose or insulin levels were observed, and there were no differences in re sponse to a glucose load (Brandao- Neto et al. 1990b). Pancreatic abnormalities (islet cellular alterations, aci nar cell necrosis, metaplasia, fibrosis, pancreatitis) resulting from zinc ingestion have been observed in rats (Maita et al. 1981), mice (Aughey et al. 1977; Maita et al. 1981), cats (Drinker et al. 1927d), ferrets (Straube et al. 1980), sheep (Allen et al. 1983), and birds (Kazacos and Van Vleet 1989; Lu et al. 1990). In dogs (Drinker et al. 1927d) and minks (Aulerich et al. 1991), histological changes in the pancreas have not been observed at doses comparable to or higher than the dose levels that caused abnormalities in rats , mice, cats, ferrets, and sheep. Degeneration of the acinar cells of the pancreas was observed in sheep by Allen et al. (1983) and in rats and mice by Maita et al. (1981). Since the pancreatic acinar cells secrete dig estive juices into the small intestine, the increase in serum amylase and lipase observed in the human case reports (Chobanian 1981; Murphy 1970) would correspond to damage in this region of the pancreas. In 2-month-old C3H mice exposed to 70 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate, hypertrophy and vacuolation of the -cells of the pancreatic islets were observed beginning after 3 mont hs of exposure and become more severe by 12 months (Aughey et al. 1977). The pa ncreatic islets secrete the hormones glucagon and insulin. No change in plasma levels of insulin and glucose was observed in this study after 6 months of exposure. No effect on islet cells was reported in rats exposed up to 565 mg/kg/day or mice exposed to 1,110 mg/kg/day as zinc sulfate in a 13-week study by Maita et al. (1981), and Allen et al. (1983) reported that islet cells in sheep were generally unaffected, although occasional vacuolization occurred. Degeneration of acinar cells, but no effects on the is let cells, were found in ducklings (Kazacos and Van Vleet 1989); however, the relevance of this to hum ans is unclear. The data are too limited and contradictory to determine whether pancreatic islet cells are a primary target cell of zinc toxicity. Adrenal Gland. Decreased levels of serum cortisol (a hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex) were observed in humans after a single dose of 0.5 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate (Brandao-Neto et al. 1990b). No effects on the adrenal gland itself have been reported in humans. ZINC 91 3. HEALTH EFFECTS In mice receiving 70 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc sulfate in the drinking water, hypertrophy and increased lipid content of the zona fasciculata cells of the adrena l cortex were observed as early as 3 months after the start of zinc supplementation (Aughey et al. 1977). Pituitary. No effects on pituitary function have been reported in humans following oral exposure to zinc. However, mice receiving 70 mg zinc/kg/day as zinc su lfate in the drinking water for 5-14 months had hypertrophy and increased granularity suggesting increased activity of the pituitary (Aughey et al. 1977). It is unclear whether the increased activity was a di rect effect of the zinc or a reaction to decreased secretion from the adrenal cortex. 3.7 CHILDREN'S SUSCEPTIBILITY This section discusses potential health effects from exposures during the period from conception to maturity at 18 years of age in humans, when all bi ological systems will have fully developed. Potential effects on offspring resulting from exposures of parental germ cells are considered, as well as any indirect effects on the fetus and neonate resulting from mate rnal exposure during gestation and lactation. Relevant animal and in vitro models are also discussed. Children are not small adults. They differ from a dults in their exposures and may differ in their susceptibility to hazardous chemicals. Children's uni que physiology and behavior can influence the extent of their exposure. Exposures of children ar e discussed in Section 6.6, Exposures of Children. Children sometimes differ from adults in their susceptib ility to hazardous chemicals, but whether there is a difference depends on the chemical (Guzelian et al. 1992; NRC 1993). Children may be more or less susceptible than adults to health effects, and the relationship may change with developmental age (Guzelian et al. 1992; NRC 1993). Vulnerability ofte n depends on developmental stage. There are critical periods of structural and functional devel opment during both prenatal and postnatal life and a particular structure or function will be most sensitiv e to disruption during its critical period(s). Damage may not be evident until a later stage of developmen t. There are often differences in pharmacokinetics and metabolism between child ren and adults. For example, absorption may be different in neonates because of the immaturity of their g astrointestinal tract and their larg er skin surface area in proportion to body weight (Morselli et al. 1980; NRC 1993); the gastroin testinal absorption of lead is greatest in infants and young children (Ziegler et al. 1978). Distribution of xenobiotics may be different; for example, infants have a larger proportion of their bodies as ex tracellular water and their brains and livers are ZINC 92 3. HEALTH EFFECTS proportionately larger (Altman and Dittmer 1974; Fomon 1966; Widdowson and Dickerson 1964). The infant also has an immature blood-brain barrier (Adinolfi 1985; Johanson 1980) and probably an immature testis barrier (Setchell and Waites 1975). Many xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes have distinctive developmental patterns. At various stages of growth and development, levels of particular enzymes ma y be higher or lower than those of adults, and sometimes unique enzymes may exist at particular de velopmental stages (Komori et al. 1990; Leeder and Kearns 1997; NRC 1993; Vieira et al. 1996). Whether differences in xenobiotic metabolism make the child more or less susceptible also depends on whethe r the relevant enzymes are involved in activation of the parent compound to its toxic form or in detoxifica tion. There may also be differences in excretion, particularly in newborns who all ha ve a low glomerular filtration rate and have not developed efficient tubular secretion and resorption capacities (Altman a nd Dittmer 1974; NRC 1993; West et al. 1948). Children and adults may differ in their capacity to repa ir damage from chemical insults. Children also have a longer remaining lifetime in which to express da mage from chemicals; this potential is particularly relevant to cancer. Certain characteristics of the developing human may increase exposure or susceptibility, whereas others may decrease susceptibility to the same chemical. For example, although infants breathe more air per kilogram of body weight than adults breathe, this di fference might be somewhat counterbalanced by their alveoli being less developed, which results in a di sproportionately smaller surface area for alveolar absorption (NRC 1993). While a detailed discussion of zinc deficiency is beyond the scope of this document, there is considerably more information on the effects of zinc deficiency on the developing fetus in pregnant women than exists for the effects of excess zinc during pregnancy. Maternal zinc deficiency can result in intrauterine growth retardation, teratogenesis, or embryonic or fetal death (for review, see King 2000). Zinc supplementation during pregnancy is usually sufficient to prevent these outcomes. Similarly, zinc deficiency during early life can result in adverse effects, including skin rash , diarrhea, anorexia, and growth failure, with more severe instances resulting in detrimental effects on the immune and nervous systems (Krebs 1999). Infants, more than adults, appear to be particularly sensitive to zinc deficiency, possibly the result of their higher zinc requirements on a per body weight basis. A case study presented by Murray (1926) reported on an infant death due to bronchopneumonia resulting from inhalation, and possibly ingestion, of an unsp ecified amount of zinc stearate powder spilled from a container. However, it is unclear whether the death was due to the zinc content or whether aspiration ZINC 93 3. HEALTH EFFECTS bronchopneumonia would result from inhalation of similar powders that do not contain zinc. Other data on the effects of zinc inhalation in young children are not available. The human data on the effects of excess zinc in childre n consist mainly of reports of acute ingestion. The primary symptoms in these subjects mimic those of adult exposure, consisting mainly of gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, epigastric disco mfort), with occasional neurologic symptoms (Anonymous 1983; Lewis and Kokan 1998; Moore 1 978; Murphy 1970). Data are not presently sufficient to determine whether children are more sensitive to these effects than adults. The most sensitive animal model to zinc toxicity in young animals appears to be the mink. Young minks appear to be more sensitive to both the hematologic (decreased hematocrit and lymphocyte number) and dermal effects (graying of the fur and dermatosis) of oral zinc than adults (Bleavins et al. 1983). Other studies have examined the effects of zinc exposure in young animals (Drinker et al. 1927d; L'Abbe and Fischer 1984a; Maita et al. 1981), but have not pr ovided data on adult animals similarly exposed for comparison. Additional data will be required to ad equately assess the susceptibility of children to zinc exposure, relative to adults. 3.8 BIOMARKERS OF EXPOSURE AND EFFECT Biomarkers are broadly defined as indicators signaling ev ents in biologic systems or samples. They have been classified as markers of exposure, markers of effect, and markers of susceptibility (NAS/NRC 1989a). Due to a nascent understanding of the use and interpre tation of biomarkers, implementation of biomarkers as tools of exposure in the general population is very limited. A biomarker of exposure is a xenobiotic substance or its metabolite(s) or the product of an interaction between a xenobiotic agent and some target molecule(s) or cell(s) that is measured within a compartment of an organism (NAS/NRC 1989). The preferred biomarkers of exposure are generally the substance itself or substance-specific metabolites in readily obtainable body fluid(s) or excreta. However, several factors can confound the use and interpretation of biomarkers of exposure. The body burden of a substance may be the result of exposures from more than one source. The substance being me asured may be a metabolite of another xenobiotic substance (e.g., high urinary levels of phenol can result from exposure to several different aromatic compounds). Depending on the properties of the subs tance (e.g., biologic half-life) and environmental conditions (e.g., duration and route of exposure), the s ubstance and all of its metabolites may have left the ZINC 94 3. HEALTH EFFECTS body by the time samples can be taken. It may be difficult to identify individuals exposed to hazardous substances that are commonly found in body tissues a nd fluids (e.g., essential mineral nutrients such as copper, zinc, and selenium). Biomarkers of e xposure to zinc are discussed in Section 3.8.1. Biomarkers of effect are defined as any measurable bi ochemical, physiologic, or other alteration within an organism that, depending on magnitude, can be recognized as an established or potential health impairment or disease (NAS/NRC 1989). This definiti on encompasses biochemical or cellular signals of tissue dysfunction (e.g., increased liver enzyme activity or pathologic changes in female genital epithelial cells), as well as physiologic signs of dysfunction such as increased blood pressure or decreased lung capacity. Note that these markers are not often substance specific. They also may not be directly adverse, but can indicate potential health impairment (e.g., DNA adducts). Biomarkers of effects caused by zinc are discussed in Section 3.8.2. A biomarker of susceptibility is an indicator of an inhe rent or acquired limitation of an organism's ability to respond to the challenge of exposure to a specific xenobiotic substance. It can be an intrinsic genetic or other characteristic or a preexisting disease that results in an increase in absorbed dose, a decrease in the biologically effective dose, or a target tissue res ponse. If biomarkers of susceptibility exist, they are discussed in Section 3.10 \"Populations that are Unusually Susceptible.\" 3.8.1 Biomarkers Used to Identify or Quantify Exposure to Zinc There is no simple measure of zinc body burde n. Under normal physiological conditions, the plasma/serum zinc level is 1 \u00b5g/mL (NAS/NRC 1979) and the urinary level is 0.5 mg/g creatinine (Elinder 1986). Several studies have reported increased levels of zinc in the serum and urine of humans and animals after inhalation, oral, or dermal exposure to zinc (Agren et al. 1991; Bentley Statter et al. 1988; Sturniolo et al. 1991). However, relations hips between serum and/or urine levels and zinc exposure levels have not been established. Hair and nail samples provide a lasting record of lo ng-term metal intake possibly over weeks or months (Hayashi et al. 1993; Wilhelm et al. 1991). Mean zinc concentrations of 129-179 \u00b5g/g have been estimated for nails (Hayashi et al. 1993; Wilhelm et al. 1991) and 102-258 \u00b5g/g for hair (Folin et al. 1991; McBean et al. 1971; Provost et al. 1993; Wilhelm et al. 1991). Most investigators have found a poor correlation between hair and plas ma zinc levels since the zinc in hair does not exchange with the ZINC 95 3. HEALTH EFFECTS body zinc pool (McBean et al. 1971; Rivlin 1983). Fu rthermore, measurements of zinc in hair can be affected by extraneous contamination of hair, contam ination by sweat, location of hair sample (distance from scalp), hair coloring, and rate of hair growth (McBean et al. 1971; Rivlin 1983). Although the nail is considered more resistant to washing procedures than hair, external contamination and uncertainties regarding the length and period of exposure reflected by the observed zinc concentration limit this measurement as a biomarker of exposure for zinc (Wilhelm et al. 1991). 3.8.2 Biomarkers Used to Characterize Effects Caused by Zinc The respiratory tract is the most sensitive target or gan for zinc following inhala tion exposure. Inhalation of zinc oxide results in a syndrome referred to as metal fume fever. Symptoms include fevers, chills, cough, listlessness, and metallic taste. Although oxid es of several heavy metals (antimony, aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, manganese, mercury, nickel, selenium, silver, and tin) of fluorocarbon polymers (polytetrafluoroethylene [Teflon] and fluorinated polyethylene propylene) also produce metal fume fever (Ellenhorn and Barceloux 1988), this group of symptoms may be used as a nonspecific biomar ker to identify inhalation exposure to zinc oxide. The target organs associated with oral zinc exposur e include the gastrointestinal tract, blood, immune system, and pancreas. The toxic effects observed af ter oral exposure to zinc include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit leve ls, immune suppression, increased serum amylase and lipase, and decreased HDL cholesterol levels (a more detailed discussion of effects associated with exposure to zinc is presented in Section 3.2). Ho wever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may be observed following exposure to any gastrointestinal irrita nt. Increases in serum amylase and lipase are also markers for pancreatic damage; therefore, any conditio n resulting in pancreatitis (i.e., biliary tract disease [gallstones], alcoholism, trauma, inflammation, bl ood-borne bacterial infections, viral infections, ischemia, and drugs such as azathioprine, thiazides, sulfonamides, and oral contraceptives) would result in similar increases in these enzymes (Cotran et al. 19 89). A hypochromic microcytic anemia that is not responsive to iron supplements may indicate exposure to zinc; however, such anemia may also reflect copper, pyridoxine, or cobalt deficiency, lead intoxication, poor diet, or chronic blood loss (Suber 1989). Thus, none of the above-mentioned effects observed afte r exposure to zinc is specific to zinc exposure. However, the combination of these toxic effects ma y be indicative of zinc overexposure. Additional information on the health effects of zinc may be found in Section 3.2.2. Additional information on ZINC 96 3. HEALTH EFFECTS biomarkers for renal, hepatob iliary, immune, and nervous system effects may be found in the CDC/ATSDR (1990) and OTA (1990) reports listed in Chapter 9. Increased erythrocyte metallothionein may be an index of zinc exposure in humans (Grider et al. 1990). Daily supplementation of 50 mg zinc/day to subject s for at least 7 days cau sed a 7-fold increase in metallothionein concentration in erythrocytes. At least 3-4 days are required before an increase in metallothionein is observed. This biomarker of e xposure is only useful for recent zinc exposure because the metallothionein levels decreased approximate ly a week after discontinuation of a 63-week supplementation of zinc (Grider et al. 1990). Fourteen days after discontinuation of zinc supplements, metallothionein levels were reduced by 61%. 3.9 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER CHEMICALS Zinc is an essential element obtained from the diet. Ma ny different metals and nutrients interact with the absorption, distribution, and excretion of zinc. However, information was not found concerning interactions that increase the toxicity of zinc or ot her substances in the presence of zinc (i.e., that cause the same amount of zinc to result in a greater toxic response). Zinc administration may increase the toxicity of lead; however, the data are conflicting (Cerklewski and Forbes 1976; Hsu et al. 1975). The toxicity of zinc is believed to be due to it s interaction with copper, as explained below. Metallothionein, a sulfhydryl-rich pr otein inducible by certain divalent cations and a variety of other agonists, is involved in the interaction between zinc and other metals such as copper (Wapnir and Balkman 1991). Inhibition of intestinal copper absorption by zinc may demonstrate competition between the two metals at the brush border of the lumen (W apnir and Balkman 1991). Dietary intake of copper (1, 6, and 36 mg/kg) or zinc (5, 30, and 180 mg/kg) do not significantly alter the absorption of the other (Oestreicher and Cousins 1985), but when zinc leve ls are much higher than copper levels, copper absorption is depressed (Fischer et al. 1981). This fact has been used therapeutically in the treatment of Wilson's Disease, in which zinc supplementation is u sed to prevent the over-absorption of copper caused by the disease (for a brief review, see Brewer 2000). High levels of dietary zinc are known to induce de novo synthesis of metallothionein in the intestinal muco sal cell. Both copper and zinc appear to bind to the same metallothionein protein; however, copper has a higher affinity for metallothionein than zinc and displaces the zinc that is attached to the metallothionein (Ogiso et al. 1979). Copper complexed with metallothionein is retained in the mucosal cell, relatively unavailable for transfer to plasma, and is excreted in the feces when the mu cosal cells are sloughed off (Fischer et al. 1981; L'Abbe and Fischer ZINC 97 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 1984b). A number of factors influence the effect of dietary zinc on copper metabolism, including the amount of copper and zinc in the diet, the zinc-to-copper ratio, age of the individual, and the duration of exposure to high zinc levels (Johnson and Flagg 1986). In a study of zinc-supplemented women, Yadrick et al. (1989) reported decreased levels of serum ferritin, a sensitive indicator of iron status. Supplementation of the subjects with iron resulted in a reversal of the diminished iron status, although whether this was due to an interaction with zinc or simply due to additional iron being provided is not clear. Othe r studies of zinc-exposed subjects have not reported significant changes in copper status (Black et al. 1988; Fischer et al. 1984; Milne et al. 2001); however, these studies have either evaluated male subjects, w ho are not as sensitive to changes in iron status, or have not evaluated serum ferritin. Physiological interactions of zinc and cadmium have been discussed in a number of reviews (EPA 1980c; NAS 1980; Underwood 1977). Exposure to cadmium may cause changes in the distribution of zinc, with accumulation of zinc in the liver and kidney. This accumulation in the liver and kidney may result in a deficiency in other organs, particularly if the dietary intake of zinc is marginal. In vitro data demonstrate that zinc and cadmium enter renal proximal cells by a saturable, carrier-mediated process and a nonsaturable pathway (Gachot and Poujeol 1992). At low cadmium doses, cadmium and zinc compete for a common transport carrier system in renal proximal cells. It is hypothesized that, at high doses, the subcellular microtubule system is disrupted by cadmi um, which may interfere with changes in carrier configuration that are necessary for transport of the metals (modification of the cytoskeleton), and thereby lead to noncompetitive inhibition between cadmium a nd zinc (Gachot and Poujeol 1992). Combined treatment with cadmium and zinc in primary cultures of kidney cells resulted in enhanced toxicity of cadmium (Yoshida et al. 1993); however, pretreatment with a nontoxic concentration of zinc caused increased induction of metallothionein synthesis and pa rtial protection against cadmium (Yoshida et al. 1993). Cadmium is 10 times more efficient than zinc in metallothionein induction in vitro (Harford and Sarkar 1991). Induction by either cadmium or zinc alone is saturable; however, simultaneous administration of cadmium and zinc results in induction of metallothi onein in an additive manner. The additive effect on metallothionein induction may involve binding of the metals either to two or more metallothionein promoter binding proteins or separate sites on the sa me promoter binding protein (Harford and Sarkar 1991). ZINC 98 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Zinc acetate pretreatment in the mouse TRL-1215 ce ll line reduced single-strand DNA damage associated with cadmium exposure (Coogan et al. 1992). Diminished cadmium-induced DNA damage was not due to decreased cadmium burden in the zinc-pretreated ce lls. Instead, cadmium levels were actually greater than those in nonpretreated cells (Coogan et al. 1992) . Metallothionein levels were elevated in these cells, suggesting that zinc pretreatment affects cadmi um genotoxicity by inducing metallothionein which may sequester cadmium from genetic material. In contrast, simultaneous exposure to cadmium and zinc decreased cadmium accumulation in the cells, pe rhaps because of direct competition for a common transport mechanism (Coogan et al. 1992). Zinc acetate reduced or prevented cadmium carcinogenesis in the prostate, in the testes, or at the injection site in rats (Gunn et al. 1963a, 1964; Waalkes et al. 1989). The effect of zinc on the cadmium-induced carcinogenesis appeared to be dependent on dose, route, and target site. Sustained levels of zinc inhibited cadmium-induced injection sarcomas but had no effect on the incidence of testicular Leydig cell tumors (Waalkes et al. 1989). Excessive dietary zinc has been shown to induce a reversible copper deficiency and anemia in experimental animals (Magee and Balkman 1991). Similar effects have been seen in humans receiving long-term treatment with zinc (Porter et al. 1977; Prasad et al. 1978). However, no significant decreases in plasma copper levels were observed in humans receiving zi nc for 6 weeks or 6 months (Henkin et al. 1976; Samman and Roberts 1987) or in mice administered zinc for 1-12 weeks (Sutomo et al. 1992). A reduction in erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (an i ndex of metabolically available copper), without a decrease in plasma copper levels, was exhibited foll owing exposure to high amounts of ingested zinc (Fischer et al. 1984). These findings suggest that superoxide dismutase may be a sensitive indicator of zinc-copper interaction. However, as not all studies of zinc supplementation have noted changes in superoxide dismutase levels, the association is still not completely clear. Cobalt has been demonstrated to induce seminiferous tubule damage and degeneration (vacuole formation, sloughing of cells, giant cell formation) in the testes of mice following exposure for 13 weeks (Anderson et al. 1993). Coadministration of cobalt and zinc chloride in the drinking water resulted in complete or partial protection in 90% of the animals. The sites of competitive interaction between zinc and cobalt were not established in the study; however, the authors postulated that the mechanism(s) may be similar to those involved in prevention of cadmium toxicity by zinc. ZINC 99 3. HEALTH EFFECTS The effect of tin on heme biosynthesis appears to be dependent on the concentrati on of zinc (Chmielnicka et al. 1992). Oral administration of tin can affect the heme synthesis by inhibiting -aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity in blood. Zinc is requi red for ALAD activity and provides a protective role in heme synthesis by increasing the activity of ALAD. It is postulated that when the tin and zinc are coadministered, these metals are probably attachi ng to similar binding sites in the ALAD enzyme (Chmielnicka et al. 1992). Calcium decreases the bioavailability of zinc; the converse is also true (Heth and Hoekstra 1965; Spencer et al. 1992). Oral zinc administration is associated w ith decreased calcium levels in the serum and in the bone of rats (Yamaguchi et al. 1983). Zinc inhibited calcium uptake in rat brush border membrane vesicles, possibly by competing directly at high-affinity calcium binding sites (Roth-Bassell and Clydesdale 1991). The interaction of calcium and zinc is apparently dose related; intestinal absorption of calcium at a low calcium intake (230 mg/day) was inhibited at a high zinc intake of 140 mg/day but not at a lower zinc intake of 100 mg/day (Spencer et al. 1992). Pretreatment with zinc has been shown to redu ce hepatotoxicity 1991; Hu et al. 1992; Szymanska et al. 1991; Yang et al. 1991). The protective effect of zinc against carbon tetrachloride t oxicity is dose dependent at high dose levels of zinc, probably because of sequestering of toxic metabolites of carbon tetrachloride by metallothionein (Cagen and Klaassen 1979). Similarly, the protective action of zinc against bromobenzene and acetaminophen appears to be associated with elevated metallothionein levels (Szymanska et al. 1991). Inhibition of lipid peroxidation may be the basis for the protective effe ct of zinc against hepatic damage induced by D-galactosamine in rats (Hu et al. 1992). Zinc may be elevating NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) content in the cell, resulting in regeneration of glutathione, which increases the antioxidative ability of hepatic cells. Salicylate-induc ed hepatic alterations (increased lipid droplets and iron, reduced glycogen) (Gunther et al. 1991) and gentamicin-induced proximal tubular necrosis (Yang et al. 1991) were diminished in rats pretreated with injecti ons of zinc chloride and zinc sulfate, respectively. This finding corresponded to a dramatic increase in me tallothionein content with combined treatment of salicylate and zinc compared to a less significant increase with salicylate alone. Animal studies suggest that the administration of zinc may also inhibit tumor growth. Forty weeks after exposure, the incidence of injection site sarcomas was 40-60% in rats receiving simultaneous intramuscular administration of nickel subsulfide and zinc oxide compared to an incidence of 100% ZINC 100 3. HEALTH EFFECTS following administration of nickel subsulfide alone (K asprzak et al. 1988). Supplementing drinking water with zinc sulfate reduced the inci dence of 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanth racene-induced tumors in the cheek pouches of mice (Poswillo and Cohen 1971). Zinc decreased DNA synthesis in hepatomas induced by 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (Duncan and Dr eosti 1975). The investigators speculated that the changes were due to inhibited cell division cycle at the level of DNA replication. 3.10 POPULATIONS THAT ARE UNUSUALLY SUSCEPTIBLE A susceptible population will exhibit a different or e nhanced response to zinc than will most persons exposed to the same level of zinc in the environment. Reasons may include genetic makeup, age, health and nutritional status, and exposure to other toxic s ubstances (e.g., cigarette smoke). These parameters result in reduced detoxification or excretion of zinc, or compromised function of organs affected by zinc. Populations who are at greater risk due to their unusually high exposure to zinc are discussed in Section 6.7, Populations with Potentially High Exposures. No specific data regarding human subpopulations that are unusually susceptible to the toxic effects of zinc were located. Healthy elde rly people have been shown to have greater daily zinc intake than housebound elderly people (Bunker et al. 1987; Prasad 1988). Data from animal studies indicate that certain human subpopulations may be more susceptible to excess zinc because of zinc's depleting effect on copper (Underwood 1977). People who are malnouris hed or have a marginal copper status may be more susceptible to the effects of excessive zinc than people who are adequately nourished (Underwood 1977). Hepatic zinc levels are elevated in patients with hemochromatosis, a genetic disease associated with increased iron absorption from the intestine (Adams et al. 1991). The chronic iron loading that occurs could result in hepatic metallothionein induction leading to the accumulation of zinc because metallothionein has a greater affinity for zinc than iron. These individuals may, therefore, have a greater likelihood of developing toxicity with zinc exposure levels that do not normally result in any symptoms in the general population. However, available studies, including this one, have not correlated increased hepatic zinc with any adverse effects. ZINC 101 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.11 METHODS FOR REDUCING TOXIC EFFECTS This section will describe clinical practice and research concerning methods for reducing toxic effects of exposure to zinc. However, because some of the treatments discussed may be experimental and unproven, this section should not be used as a guide for treatment of exposures to zinc. When specific exposures have occurred, poison control centers a nd medical toxicologists should be consulted for medical advice. The following text provides specific information about treatment following exposures to zinc: Ellenhorn MJ, Barceloux DG. 1988. Medical toxicology: Diagnosis and human poisoning. New York, NY: Elsevier, 879-880, 1064-1065. 3.11.1 Reducing Peak Absorption Following Exposure General recommendations for the mana gement and treatment of patients following acute exposure to zinc include removal of the victim from the contaminated area and removal and isolation of contaminated clothing, jewelry, and shoes (Br onstein and Currance 1988; Stutz and Janusz 1988). Excess contaminant is gently brushed away and excess liquids blotted with absorbent material. Measures that are appropriate to the route of exposure are taken to remove zinc from the body. Exposed eyes are flushed immediately with water, followed as soon as possible with irrigation of each eye with normal saline. Exposed skin is washed immediately with soapy water. Administ ration of ipecac to induce emesis, gastric lavage, ingestion of activated charcoal, and cathartics have been recommended to decrease the gastrointestinal absorption of zinc (Burkhart et al. 1990; Ellenhor n and Barceloux 1988). Because zinc causes nausea and vomiting following exposure by the oral route, use of emetic agents may be unnecessary. Ipecac administration may be contraindicated following inge stion of caustic zinc compounds such as zinc chloride. The large amounts of phosphorus and calcium in milk and cheese, and phytate in brown bread, may reduce absorption of zinc from th e gastrointestinal tract (Pecoud et al. 1975). Therefore, if vomiting and diarrhea are not prohibitive, ingestion of dairy products or brown bread may also reduce gastrointestinal absorption of zinc. In a study of intestinal absorption of zinc in iron-deficient mice, the uptake of zinc from the gut was inhibited by adding iron to the duodenal loop system. The proposed mechanism was that iron and zinc shared a common gut mucosal binding site (Hamilton et al. 1978). However, it is unknown whether ingestion of iron suppl ements would be effective in reducing absorption of zinc overdoses. ZINC 102 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.11.2 Reducing Body Burden Zinc is an essential trace element that is normally fo und in tissues and fluids throughout the body and is under homeostatic control (NAS/NRC 1989b). Increased le vels have been observed in the heart, spleen, kidneys, liver, bone, and blood of animals following s ubchronic oral exposure to zinc (Llobet et al. 1988a) indicating that some zinc accumulation occurs during excess intakes. The greatest increases were observed in bone and blood. Administration of the chelating agent, calcium disodium ethylene diaminetetraacetate (CaNa 2EDTA), is the treatment of choice for reducing the body burden of zinc in humans following exposure to high levels (Ellenhorn and Barceloux 1988). Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), and dimercaprol (BAL) are the most common antidotes used in the treatment of human zinc intoxications (Llobet et al. 1989; Murphy 1970; Spencer and Rosoff 1966). Markedly elevated serum zinc levels in a young child who ingested a zinc chloride solution were normalized by intravenously administering a single small dose of CaNa 2EDTA (11.5 mg/kg) (Potter 1981). Use of chelation therapy (administration of BAL) was reported in a case study of a 16-year-old boy who ingested 12 g of metallic zinc (Murphy 1970). The boy exhibited lethargy and el evated blood zinc levels that were both reversed following intramuscular administration of BAL. Chel ation therapy has been demonstrated to increase the urinary excretion of zinc 22-fold (Spencer and nebulized N-acetylcysteine (another metal chelating agent) have also been ob served to increase urinary zinc excretion and decrease plasma levels following inhalation of zinc chloride smoke (Hjortso et al. 1988). The efficacy of 16 different chelating agents as possi ble antidotes for acute oral zinc exposure has been determined in mice (Llobet et al. 1988b). The most efficient chelators tetraacetic acid (CDTA), and EDTA. Increased urinary levels of zinc and decreased bone and liver zinc levels were observed following administration of the ch elators. The maximum efficiency of the chelators was observed when they were administered from 10 minutes to 12 hours after zinc exposure (Domingo et al. 1988a, 1988b). 3.11.3 Interfering with the Mechanism of Action for Toxic Effects Anemia has been observed in humans and animals after or al exposure to zinc. It has been postulated that excess zinc intake may result in copper deficiency (m echanisms of action are discussed in Section 3.5). The anemia observed following zinc intake is belie ved to be caused by the copper deficiency. ZINC 103 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Administration of copper in patients with zinc-rela ted anemia has been shown to be effective in increasing the hemoglobin levels (Porte r et al. 1977; Smith and Larson 1946). The exact mechanism of metal fume fever (a syndrom e consisting of a leukocytosis with chills, fever, cough, myalgias, headache, weakness, and dyspn ea) is unknown (Ellenhorn and Barceloux 1988), but respiratory tract inflammation and the development of an immune complex reaction have been proposed (McCord 1960). Treatment is supportive (e.g., bed r est, analgesics, and antipyretics) (Mueller and Seger 1985). In severe cases, inhalation of zinc chloride has resulted in advanced pulmonary fibrosis and fatal respiratory distress syndrome (Evans 1945; Hjortso et al. 1988; Milliken et al. 1963). L-3,4-Dehydro\u00ad proline was given to two soldiers after inhaling a high concentration of zinc chloride smoke (also contained other chemicals) in an attempt to inhibit collagen deposition in the lungs (Hjortso et al. 1988). This therapy did not prevent respiratory failure. 3.12 ADEQUACY OF THE DATABASE Section 104(i)(5) of CERCLA, as amended, directs the Administrator of ATSDR (in consultation with the Administrator of EPA and agencies and programs of the Public Health Service) to assess whether adequate information on the health effects of zinc is available. Where adequate information is not available, ATSDR, in conjunction w ith the National Toxicology Program (NTP), is required to assure the initiation of a program of research designed to determin e the health effects (and techniques for developing methods to determine such health effects) of zinc. The following categories of possible data needs have been identified by a joint team of scientists from ATSDR, NTP, and EPA. They are defined as substance-specific informational needs that if met would reduce the uncertainties of human health assessment. This definition should not be interpreted to mean that all data needs discussed in this section must be filled. In the future, the identified data needs will be evaluated and prioritized, and a substance- specific research agenda will be proposed. ZINC 104 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 3.12.1 Existing Information on Health Effects of Zinc The existing data on health effects of inhalation, oral , and dermal exposure of humans and animals to zinc are summarized in Figure 3-4. The purpose of this figure is to illustrate the existing information concerning the health effects of zinc. Each dot in the figure indicates that one or more studies provide information associated with that particular effect. The dot does not necessarily imply anything about the quality of the study or studies, nor should missing in formation in this figure be interpreted as a \"data need\". A data need, as defined in ATSDR's Decisi on Guide for Identifying Substance-Specific Data Needs Related to Toxicological Profiles (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 1989), is substance-specific information necessary to cond uct comprehensive public health assessments. Generally, ATSDR defines a data gap more broadly as any substance-specific information missing from the scientific literature. Figure 3-4 indicates whether a particular health effect end point has been studied for a specific route and duration of exposure. There is little information concerning death in humans after inhalation, oral, or dermal exposure to zinc. However, several case studies report death after exposure to extremely high levels of zinc chloride and other components of zi nc chloride smoke (Evans 1945; Hjortso et al. 1988; Milliken et al. 1963). Systemic effects of acute inhalation exposure to ge nerally unspecified levels of various zinc compounds in humans have been reported in several clinical cas e studies (Blanc et al. 1991; Brown 1988; Hjortso et al. 1988; Matarese and Matthews 1966; Vogelmeier et al. 1987). Case studies and experimental studies of systemic effects in humans following acute, intermediate, and chronic oral exposures are available (Anonymous 1983; Black et al. 1988; Brandao-Neto et 1980; et al. 1990; Moore Patterson et Porter et al. 1977; Potte r 1981; Prasad et al. 1978). Experimental studies in humans following acute, intermediate, and chronic de rmal exposures were located for hematological, dermal, and ocular effects al. 1984; Turner 1921; Yadrick et al. 1989). Information concerning respiratory effects of acute i nhalation exposure to zinc in animals is available (Amdur et al. 1982; Drinker and Drinker 1928; Lam et al. 1982, 1988). One study (Marrs et al. 1988) was located regarding other systemic effects in an imals following inhalation exposure to zinc for an intermediate-exposure duration.

HEALTH EFFECTS Figure 3-4. Existing Information on Health Effects of Zinc ZINC 106 3. HEALTH EFFECTS in animals is available for acute, intermediate, and chronic exposure durations (Allen et al. 1983; Anderson and Danylchuk 1979; Aughey et al. 1977; Bentley and Grubb 1991; Domingo et al. 1988a; Drinker et al. 1981; Straube et al. 1980; Walters and Roe 1965). One acute dermal study evaluated dermal irritancy in animals (Lansdown 1991). Immunological effects were reported in humans following inhalation exposure to zinc oxide (Blanc et al. 1991; Farrell 1987). Another study reported potentia l adverse immunological effects following oral exposure of humans (Chandra 1984). Clinical sympto ms suggestive of neurological effects have been reported by humans following inhalation exposure (Rohrs 1957; Sturgis et al. 1927; Wilde 1975) or oral exposure (Anonymous 1983; Murphy 1970; Potter 1981) to zinc. There were studies that examined reproductive and developmental effects in women orally exposed to zinc during their pregnancies (Kynast and Saling 1986; Mahomed et al. 1989; Simmer et al. 1991). One study examined immunological and reproductive effects in animals following inhalation exposure to zinc chloride (Marrs et al. 1988). Immunological and neurological end points were evaluated in animals following oral exposure to zinc (Bleavins et al. 1983; Kozik et al. 1980, 1981; Schiffer et al. 1991). Information regarding developmental and reproductive effects in animals after oral exposure to zinc is available (Cox et al. 1969; Ketcheson et al. 1969; Ki nnamon Pal and Pal 1987; Schlicker and Cox 1968; Sutton and Nelson 1937). Studies regarding genotoxicity in animals after inhalation and oral exposures to zinc are limited (Gupta et al. 1991; Kowalska-Wochna et al. 1988; Voroshilin et al. 1978). Epidemiological studies regarding carcinogenicity after i nhalation and oral exposure to zinc are available (Logue et al. 1982; Neuberger and Hollowell 1982; Philipp et al. 1982; Stocks and Davies 1964); however, they were not well controlled and the data are of little significance. Studies are available regarding carcinogenicity in animals after inhalation and oral exposure to zinc (Marrs et al. 1988; Walters and Roe 1965). However, the studies have several deficiencies that limit their usefulness. 3.12.2 Identification of Data Needs Acute-Duration Exposure. Symptoms of metal fume fever (headache, fever, leukocytosis, myalgias) have been observed in humans acutely ex posed to airborne zinc oxide (Blanc et al. 1991; Brown 1988; Drinker et al. 1927b; Sturgis et al. 1927). Acute oral exposure to zinc has resulted in ZINC 107 3. HEALTH EFFECTS gastrointestinal disturbances (abdominal pain, na usea, vomiting, esophageal erosion), evidence of pancreatic damage (increased serum amylase and lipase levels), and decreased levels of serum cortisol in humans (Anonymous 1983; Brandao-Neto et al. Chobanian 1981; Murphy 1970; Potter 1981). Acute dermal exposure to zinc oxide has not been sh own to be irritating to human skin (Agren 1990). Toxic effects similar to those observed for metal fume fever have been observed in guinea pigs (Amdur et al. 1982; Lam et al. 1985). In addition to LD 50 data, only one reliable study assessed the acute oral toxicity of zinc compounds in animals. Pancreatic, gastrointestinal, and liver damage were observed in sheep (Allen et al. 1983). It is doubtful that sheep (ruminant animals) are an appropriate model for toxicity of orally administered zinc in humans. The dermal toxicity of several zinc compounds has been tested in rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice (Lansdown 1991) . Zinc acetate, zinc chloride, and zinc sulfate have irritating properties. Skin irritation was not obser ved in rabbits, guinea pigs, or mice after zinc oxide paste application (Lansdown 1991). The animal data (Amdur et al. 1982; Drinker a nd Drinker 1928; Lam et al. 1982, 1988) corroborate occupational exposure studies that indicate metal fume fe ver is an end point of concern. However, other possible targets of toxicity have not been examined. Thus, an acute inhalation MRL cannot be derived. A large amount of the human oral exposure data is in the form of case reports, and a great deal of uncertainty exists regarding the dose levels. The uncertainty about whether sheep are a good model for humans precludes using these data to derive an oral MRL for acute-duration ex posure. Additional studies involving acute exposure to zinc compounds by all routes of exposure would be helpful to identify target organ and dose-response relationships. There are groups who may be exposed to zinc at hazardous waste sites for brief periods; therefore, this information is important. Intermediate-Duration Exposure. Metal fume fever was observed in an individual exposed to zinc fumes and zinc powder for approximately 1 month (Mal o et al. 1990). Anemia and decreased levels of HDL cholesterol have been observed in humans taki ng high doses of zinc supplements (Chandra 1984; Hoffman al. 1988; Hooper et al. 1980). Intermedia te-duration dermal exposure to zinc oxide dust has resulted in pustular lesions, but these lesions were a ttributed to clogging of the sebaceous glands resulting from poor hygiene (Turner 1921). Rats, mice, and guin ea pigs exposed to smoke containing zinc chloride and other compounds had evidence of lung irritation (Marrs et al. 1988). No intermediate-duration animal dermal studies were located. In animals that ingested zinc for an intermediate duration, anemia and kidney and pancreas damage were observed (Ben tley and Grubb 1991; Drinke r et al. al. 1988a; Maita et al. 1981; Straube et al. 1980). ZINC 108 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Only one case report regarding human intermediate-dur ation inhalation exposure was located, and this study did not report the exposure level (Malo et al . 1990). Thus, an intermediate-duration inhalation MRL could not be derived. There are less serious LOAELs (decreased serum HDL cholesterol) identified in the Hooper et al. (1980) and Chandra (1984) human oral exposure studies; however, evidence regarding this effect is inconsistent (Bogden et al . 1988; Hale et al. 1988; Samman and Roberts 1988). An intermediate-duration oral MRL was derived fo r zinc based on effects (decreased hematocrit, serum ferritin, and erythrocyte superoxide women given 50 mg Zn/day as zinc gluconate supplements for 10 weeks (Yadrick et al. 1989); as these effects were subclinical, they were considered to be non-adverse, and were identif ied as a NOAEL. Several other studies of zinc supplementation in humans support this NOAEL (Bonham et al. 2003a, 2003b; Davis et al. 2000; Fischer et al. 1984; Milne et al. 2001). The toxic effects of intermediate-duration exposure to zinc compounds are relatively well characterized for the oral route. There are insufficient toxicokinetic data to determine if the toxic effects observed following oral exposure woul d occur following inhalation or dermal exposure. Inhalation and dermal studies would be useful to determine possible target organs and dose-response relationships. There are populations surrounding hazar dous waste sites that might be exposed to zinc compounds for similar durations. Chronic-Duration Exposure and Cancer. No exposure-related effects on lung function were observed in a group of welders chronically exposed to zinc (Marquart et al. 1989). Anemia has been observed in humans following ingestion of high doses of zinc supplements (Broun et al. 1990; Hale et al. 1988; Porter et al. 1977; Prasad et al. 1978). Chronic-duration dermal exposure to zinc oxide dust has resulted in pustular lesions, but these were attribut ed to clogging of the sebaceous glands resulting from poor hygiene (Batchelor et al. 1926). No chronic-dur ation inhalation or dermal studies in animals were located. Pancreatic damage was observed in mice after chronic exposure to zinc sulfate in drinking water (Aughey et al. 1977). A chronic-duration inhalation MRL c ould not be derived for zinc becau se neither of the inhalation studies reported the levels of airborne zinc. Due to a l ack of adequate chronic-duration oral studies, the intermediate-duration oral MRL was adopted as the chronic-duration oral MRL, hrocyte dismutase) women given zinc gluconate supplements for 10 weeks (Yadrick et al. 1989). Additional studies involving chronic exposure to zinc compounds by all routes of exposure would be he lpful to identify dose-response relationships. ZINC 109 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Although there are several human and animal carcino genicity studies, the limitations of these studies preclude their use in assessing the carcinogenicity of zinc (Logue et al. 1982; Neuberger and Hollowell 1982; Walters and Roe 1965). Carcinogenicity studies by all routes of exposure would be useful. Genotoxicity. Several in vitro microbial gene mutation assays were negative (Marzin and et al. 1989; Venitt and Levy 1974; Wong 1988), but evidence from gene mutation assays in mammalian cells is mixed (Amach er and Paillet 1980; Thompson et al. 1989). An increase in the occurrence of chromosomal aberrations was observed in vitro in human lymphocytes (Deknudt and Deminatti 1978) and in vivo in rats and mice (Deknudt and Gerber 1979; Gupta et al. 1991; Kowalska-Wochna et al. 1988; Voroshilin et al. 1978). Increased sister chromatid exchange was observed in vivo in rat bone marrow (Kowalska-Wochna et al . 1988). However, while there are sufficient in vivo data establishing the clastogenicity of zinc, data re garding the mutagenicity of zinc are conflicting. Studies designed to assay different types of genotoxicity (i.e., mutagenicity in mammalian cells, effect of excess zinc on DNA replication) would be useful fo r determining the genotoxic potential of zinc. Reproductive Toxicity. No complications occurred in the pregnancies of women exposed to daily doses of zinc sulfide during the last two trimesters (Mahomed et al. 1989). No studies were located regarding the reproductive toxicity of zinc in humans after inhalation or dermal exposure. Increased pre- implantation loss and reproductive dysfunction in rats we re observed in oral exposure studies (Pal and Pal 1987; Sutton and Nelson 1937). No histological changes in reproductive organs were observed in rats, mice, or guinea pigs following inhalation exposure to zinc chloride smoke, but reproductive function was not assessed (Marrs et al. 1988). No dermal reproductive toxicity studies in animals were located. Inhalation and dermal studies assessing reproductive func tion would be useful to determine whether zinc has the potential to cause reproductive effects by these routes. An oral reproductive toxicity study in a different animal strain as well as a multigeneration study, including reproductive organ pathology, would be useful for determining whether oral zinc exposure is likely to cause reproductive toxicity in humans. Developmental Toxicity. No studies were located regarding the potential of zinc to cause developmental effects in humans afte r inhalation or dermal exposure. In a very brief report of a human study in which pregnant women received high-doses of zinc supplements during the last trimester of pregnancy, an increased incidence of stillbirths and one premature delivery were observed (Kumar 1976). This study, however, has many limitations. Increased fetal resorptions were observed in rats after oral exposure to zinc (Schlicker and Cox 1968). No studies were located regarding de velopmental toxicity in animals after inhalation or dermal exposure to zinc . Additional inhalation, oral, and dermal exposure ZINC 110 3. HEALTH EFFECTS studies in animals would be useful to predict whet her developmental effects should be a concern for humans exposed to zinc. Immunotoxicity. Metal fume fever is believed to be an immune response to zinc oxide. A correlation between the concentration of airborne zinc and the number of all types of T cells (helper, inducer, suppressor, and killer) in the bronchoa lveolar lavage fluid of humans, possibly related to the onset of metal fume fever, was observed in an acute-durati on inhalation study (Blanc et al. 1991). Impaired immune response in humans has been reported in an intermediate-duration oral study (Chandra 1984). No immune effects were observed in mice after oral exposure to zinc (Schiffer et al. 1991). There is some limited information to suggest that the immune sy stem is a target of zinc toxicity. A battery of immune function tests after inhalation, oral, and dermal exposure to zi nc compounds would be useful in determining if zinc is immunotoxic. Neurotoxicity. Staggering gait and hallucinations were reported in an individual who intentionally inhaled metallic paint aerosols (Wilde 1975). Because there was simultaneous exposure to copper and hydrocarbons, this study cannot be used to assess the neurotoxic potential of zinc. Nonspecific signs and symptoms of neurotoxicity (light-headedness, dizziness, headache, and lethargy) have been reported by humans following acute oral exposure to zinc (Murphy 1970; Potter 1981). Very limited data suggest that high oral doses of zinc can cause minor neuron de generation and alteration of secretion of the hypothalamus in rats (Kozik et al. 1980, 1981). No studies were located regarding neurotoxic effects in animals after inhalation or dermal exposure to zinc. Additional studies by all routes of exposure would be useful to determine if exposure to zinc compounds would result in neurotoxicity. Epidemiological and Human Dosimetry Studies. Acute high-level exposure to zinc by inhalation resulted in respiratory irritation and metal fume fever (Blanc et al. 1991; Hjortso et al. 1988; Johnson and 1981; Schenker et al. 1981; Sturgis et al. 1927). Welders are a subpopulation of workers who have a high potential fo r exposure to zinc oxide. Most of the available studies did not report exposure levels or used a sm all number of subjects. Studies that correlate occupational exposure to zinc with health effects would be useful. A number of human oral exposure studies have shown that excess levels of zinc can resu lt in anemia, pancreatic damage, decreased serum HDL cholesterol levels, and immunotoxicity (Black et al. 1988; Chandra 1984; Hooper et al. 1980). There are insufficient data for establishing dose-res ponse relationships. Studies designed to establish dose-response relationships would be useful for establishing cause/effect relationships and future monitoring of individuals living near hazardous waste sites. ZINC 111 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Biomarkers of Exposure and Effect. Exposure . Increased serum and urine levels of zinc were observed in humans and animals after inhalation, oral, or dermal exposure to zinc (Bentley and Grubb 1991; Brandao-Neto et al. 1990b; Hallmans 1977; Keen and Hurley 1977). However, the relationships between zinc exposure levels and the levels of zinc in biological fluids have not b een established. Hair and nail samples may be a potential biomarker for long-term zinc exposure (McBean et al. 1971; Rivlin 1983; Wilhelm et al. 1991); however, no correlation has been demonstrated between these parameters and zinc exposure levels. Development of a biomarker with more exposure and dose data would aid in future medical surveillance that could lead to better detection of zinc exposure. Effect . Several potential biomarkers for the effects of zinc have been identified. These include increased levels of serum amylases and lipase, indicative of pa ncreatic damage; non-iron anemia; and decreased HDL cholesterol levels (Suber 1989). Howeve r, these biomarkers of effect are not specific for zinc. These biomarkers cannot be used for dosimet ry. A potential biomarker of exposure for recent exposures to zinc is increased erythrocyte metallothi onein concentrations (Grider et al. 1990). Further investigation of serum biomarkers of effect, particularly for chronic exposure, in zinc-exposed populations would be useful to determine whether exposed populations may be experiencing adverse health effects as the result of zinc exposures. Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion. Absorption of zinc in humans after oral exposure to high levels has been well described (Aamodt et al. 1983; Hunt et al. 1991; Reinhold Sandberg 1992; Spencer et al. 1985). However, quantitative evidence of zinc absorption in humans after inhalation or dermal exposure is very limited. It is known that workers exposed to zinc oxide fumes who experience toxic effects have elevated levels of zinc in plasm a and urine (Hamdi 1969). However, it remains to be established whether the elevated levels are the result of the pulmonary absorption or of the swallowing of particles leading to gastrointestinal absorption. Toxic effects have also been observed in humans after dermal exposure (DuBray 1937), indicating dermal absorption. Information regarding the absorption of zinc in anim als following inhalation exposure was limited to lung retention data (Gordon et al. 1992; Hirano et al. 1989). However, there was information to assess the extent of absorption following oral exposure (Dav ies 1980; Galvez-Morros et al. 1992; Johnson et al. ZINC 112 3. HEALTH EFFECTS 1988; Weigand and Kirchgessner 1992). Evidence is limit ed regarding dermal absorption in animals, but it indicates that zinc sulfate and zinc oxide can penetrate the skin (Agren 1990; Agren et al. 1991; Gordon et al. 1981; Hallmans 1977). Mechanistic data on the oral absorption is reported by Hempe and Cousins (1992); however, there is a lack of information re garding the mechanism of action of inhalation and dermal exposures. Information on physiological levels and zinc distribut ion following subtoxic shor t-term exposures to zinc in humans and animals is abundant (NAS/NRC 1979; Wastney et al. 1986). Blood levels of zinc have been determined in humans following oral exposure to zinc sulfate (Neve et al. 1991; Statter et al. 1988; Sturniolo et al. 1991). Increased zinc tissue content has been seen after short-term oral exposure in humans (Cooke et al. 1990; He et al. 1991; Llobet et al. 1988a; Schiffer et al. 1991; Weigand and Kirchgessner 1992). Studies on tissue distribution in humans following high exposure to zinc for inhalation, oral, and dermal would be useful. Ther e were no studies regarding blood or tissue distribution after acute, high-level exposures to zinc in animals following inhalation or dermal exposure. Additional mechanistic data on the transfer of zinc from respir atory and dermal absorption sites to the blood would be useful. The principal excretion route of ingested zinc is through the intestines (Davies and Nightingale 1975; Reinhold et al. 1991; Wastney et al. 1986). There is a lack of information regarding the excretion of zinc in both animals and humans following inhalation and dermal exposure. Therefore, additional studies designed to assess the t oxicokinetic properties of zinc following inhalation and dermal exposures would be useful. Comparative Toxicokinetics. Data suggest that humans and an imals have similar target organs of zinc toxicity (Allen et al. 1983; Aughey et al. 1977; Black et al. 1991; al. 1984; 1973; 1982, Maita et al. 1981; Moore 1978; Murphy Larson 1946; Straube et al. 1980; Sturgis et al. 1927). Toxicokinetic studies have been performed in both humans and an imals following oral exposure; however, data are limited for inhalation and dermal exposures. The animal model used most often to evaluate the toxicokinetics of zinc are rats (Agren et al. 1991; Alexander et al. 1981; Galvez-Morros et 1988a; Weigand a nd Kirchgessner 1992) and may be a good model for assessing the kinetics of zinc in humans. ZINC 113 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Methods for Reducing Toxic Effects. No established methods or treatments for reducing the absorption of zinc were located. Studies that examined the effectiveness of emetics and cathartics in the prevention of zinc absorption would be useful. Once absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, zinc bound to plasma albumin is distributed to the rest of the body. Zinc has a high affinity for proteins, and a number of chelating agents are effective in incr easing al. 1988a, 1988b; Llobet et al. 1989). Studies designed to examine the effectiveness of chelating agents following chronic zinc exposure would be useful in determining treatments to reduce the zinc body burden. Very little information is known about the absorption and distribution of zinc following inhala tion or dermal exposure. Studies to determine the mechanisms of absorption and distribution would be useful for developing treatments or methods for reducing the toxic effects of zinc af ter inhalation or dermal exposure. Although the exact mechanisms of many of the toxic actions of zinc are not known, the pathogenesis of metal fume fever following inhalation exposure (M cCord 1960; Mueller and Seger 1985) and anemia following oral exposure (Prasad et al. 1978) are known. Studies to more clearly elucidate the mechanisms involved in metal fume fever and anemia and to determine the mechanisms involved in pancreatic damage and decreased HDL cholesterol levels would be useful. Therapy for metal fume fever is mainly supportive (Mueller and Seger 1985). Administration of copper has been shown to be effective in alleviating zinc-induced anemia (Porter et al. 1977). Research into methods useful for mitigating metal fume fever and other adverse effe cts of zinc would be helpful. Children's Susceptibility. Data needs relating to both prenatal and childhood exposures, and developmental effects expressed either prenatally or during childhood, are discussed in detail in the Developmental Toxicity subsection above. While a considerable amount of data are available on the effects of zinc deficiency on the growth and development of children, less is known about the effect s of excess zinc on children. Accidental acute oral exposures result in mainly gastrointestinal symp toms, including nausea, vomiting, and epigastric discomfort (Anonymous 1983; Lewis and Kokan 1998; Moore 1978; Murphy 1970). Data are not presently available to determine whether children are more susceptible to these effects than adults. Similarly, additional animal studies examining th e effects of similar exposure on young and mature animals would be useful to further clarify possible mechanisms of childhood susceptibility, if it exists. ZINC 114 3. HEALTH EFFECTS Child health data needs relating to exposure are discussed in Section 6.8.1, Identification of Data Needs: Exposures of Children. 3.12.3 Ongoing Studies A selection of ongoing studies, located in the Fede ral Research in Progress database (FEDRIP 2003), is presented in Table 3-6.

CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL INFORMATION 4.1 CHEMICAL IDENTITY Information concerning the chemical identity of elemen tal zinc and zinc compounds is listed in Table 4-1. Zinc is a naturally occurring element found in the earth =s surface rocks. Because of its reactivity, zinc metal is not found as the free element in nature. Ther e are approximately 55 mineralized forms of zinc. The most important zinc minerals in the wo rld are sphalerite (ZnS), smithsonite (ZnCO 3), appears in Group IIB of the periodic table and has two common oxidation states, Zn(0) and Zn(+2). Zinc forms a variety of different compounds, such as zinc chloride, zinc oxide, and zinc sulfate (Goodwin 1998; Ohnesorge and Wilhelm 1991; WHO 2001). 4.2 PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES Information regarding the physical and chemical pr operties of elemental zinc and zinc compounds is located in Table 4-2. Zinc is a lustrous, blue-white metal that burns in air with a bluish-green flame. It is stable in dry air, but upon exposure to moist air, it becomes covered with a film of zinc oxide or basic carbonate (e.g., 2ZnCO 3\u00b73Zn(OH) 2) isolating the underlying metal and retarding further corrosion. Bonding in zinc compounds tends to be covalent, as in the sulfide a nd oxide (Goodwin 1998). In solution, four to six ligands can be coordinated with the zinc ion. Zinc has a strong tendency to react with acidic, alkaline, and inorganic compounds. Since zinc is amphoteric (i.e ., capable of reacting chemically either as an acid or a base), it also forms zincates (e.g., [Zn(OH) 3H2O]- and [Zn(OH) 4]2-) (Goodwin 1998; Ohnesorge and Wilhelm 1991; WHO 2001). In humans and animals, zinc is an essential nutrient that plays a role in membrane stability, in over 300 enzymes, and in the metabolism of proteins and nucleic acids (WHO 2001). ZINC 120 4.

PRODUCTION, IMPORT/E XPORT, USE, AND DISPOSAL 5.1 PRODUCTION No information is available in the TRI database on facilities that manufacture or process zinc because this chemical is not required to be reported under S ection 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986) (EPA 1997). Zinc is widely distributed in nature, constituting 20-200 ppm (by weight) of the Earth's crust (Goodwin 1998), but it is not found as elemental zinc in nature (Lloyd and Showak 1984). The procedure used to mine zinc varies with the composition of the ore. The mineral sphalerite (ZnS) provides ca. 90% of the zinc produced today (Goodwin 1998). Zinc ore is mined using both underground mining and open pit mining (Stokinger 1981). The mined zinc ores are too low in zinc content for direct reduction to refined metal; thus, they are first concentrated. Production of concentrates requires crushing and grinding followed by gravity or magnetic methods of separation or flotation. These processes may be combined, depending on the complexity of the ore. A caustic -leach process is used to decrease the extent of metal loss during the concentration process. In this process, the metal is leached by caustic soda, the resulting electrolyte is purified with zinc dust and lime, and th e zinc is electrodeposited. The crude zinc may be dissolved in sulfuric acid and purified by electrode position. Two processes are used to produce metallic zinc from the ore concentrates that are not subjected to caustic soda leaching. In one process, the ore concentrate containing zinc sulfide is roasted in the presence of air to produce zinc oxide, which is combined with coke or coal and retorted to approxim ately 1,100 \u00b0C to produce metallic zinc. In the other process, the roasted zinc oxide is leached with sulf uric acid, and the solution is electrolyzed to produce zinc of >99.9% purity. The electrolytic processing of zinc is replacing smelting as the most commonly used process (Lloyd and Show ak 1984; Stokinger 1981). Continued low zinc prices in 2001 have resulted in operation reductions and facility closures across the United States. By the end of 2001, 12 mines in 5 st ates were in operation in the United States. Alaska was the leading zinc-mining state, followed by (in descending order) Tennessee, Missouri, New York, and Montana. Alaska also had the largest production of recoverable zinc in the United States in 2001, followed by Missouri, Montana, and New York. In 2001, three companies operated three primary zinc refineries (Zinc Corporation of America, Monaco, Pe nnsylvania; Big River Zinc Corporation, Sauget, ZINC 130 5. PRODUCTION, IMPORT/EXPORT, USE, AND DISPOSAL Illinois; and Pasminco Ltd., Clarksville, Tennessee) (USGS 2001). Tables 5-1 and 5-2 summarize the facilities that manufacture or process zinc and zinc compounds, respectively, in the United States. The information in this table was obtained from the T oxics Release Inventory (TRI), and it summarizes the reported release data for 2002 (TRI 02 2004). However, this list does not include all facilities that manufacture or process zinc and zinc compounds. Ta bles 5-1 and 5-2 also list the maximum amounts of zinc and zinc compounds, respectively, that are present at these sites and the end uses of zinc. In 2001, approximately 799,000 metric tons of zinc was pr oduced in the United States from domestic ores. The estimated world production from mines in 2001 was 8,85 0,000 metric tons. The world production of zinc has increased from 1997 to 2001 (USGS 2001). Zinc is available in many commercial forms, including ingots, lumps, sheets, wire, shot, strips, sticks, granules, granulated zinc (obtained when molten meta l is poured into cold water), and powder (O'Neil et al. 2001). 5.2 IMPORT/EXPORT In 2002, approximately 874,000 metric tons of zinc were imported to the United States as refined slab zinc, 122,000 metric tons were imported as ores and concentrates, and 7,240 metric tons were imported as rolled zinc. In 2002, the United States imported more refined slab and rolled zinc than in 2001, going against the trend observed in the previous 4 years. More ores and concentrate were imported in 2002 than in the previous 4 years (USGS 2003). In 2002, an estimated 822,000 metric tons of ores and concentrates, 1,160 metric tons of slab zinc, and 7,200 metric tons of rolled zinc were exported from the United States. In contrast, exports of ores and concentrates reached approximately 23,000 metric to ns in 1985 and 461,000 in 1997 (DOI 1988, 1991; USGS 2002). In 2001, the United States exported the largest amounts of zinc ores and concentrates to Japan (210,000 metric tons), Canada (171,000 metr ic tons) and Spain (122, 000 metric tons) (USGS 2002). 5.3 USE Zinc metal is used most commonly as a protective coating of other metals, such as iron and steel. Methods, in general, include hot-dip galvanizing, continuous-line galvanizing, electro-galvanizing, zinc ZINC 131 5. PRODUCTION, IMPORT/EXPORT, USE, AND DISPOSAL Table 5-1.

Some examples of galvanized materials include nails, water towers, and electrical transmission towers. Because zinc metal lacks strength, it is frequently alloyed with other metals (e.g., aluminum , copper, titanium, and magnesium) to impart a range of properties. When zinc metal is the primary com ponent of the alloy, it is called a 'zinc-base' alloy, which is primarily used for casting and wrought applicati ons. Other important applications of zinc alloys are in dye-casting, construction, and in other alloys (e.g., brass and bronze) which may be found in electrical components of many household goods. Also, alloys containing zinc and copper are used to make U.S. one-cent coins. Zinc metal dust is wide ly used in paint coatings, as a catalyst, and as a reducing and precipitating agent in organic and anal ytical chemistry (Goodwin 1998). As shown in Table 5-3, in 2002, the reported consumption of zinc by industry was 265,000 metric tons (53.4% of total consumption) for galvanizing; 103,000 metric tons (20.8% of total consumption) for zinc-based alloys; and 86,800 metric tons (17.5% of total consumption) for bass and bronze (USGS 2002). Zinc compounds have dental, medical, and household a pplications. In pharmaceuticals, zinc salts are used as solubilizing agents in many drugs, includi ng insulin (Lloyd 1984; Lloyd and Showak 1984; Windholz 1983). Zinc compounds are utilized therapeutically in human medicine in the treatment of zinc deficiency (Keen and Hurley 1977). Zinc oxide acc ounts for the largest use of zinc compounds, and is used primarily by the rubber industry as a vulcanization activator and accelerator and to slow rubber aging by neutralizing sulfur and organic acids formed by oxidation. It also acts in rubber as a reinforcing agent, a heat conductor, a white pigment, and an abso rber of UV light. In paints, zinc oxide serves as a mildewstat, acid buffer, and a pigment. It is used in animal feed as a zinc supplement and as a fertilizer- additive for zinc-deficient soils. Zinc oxide is used in cosmetics and drugs primarily for its fungicide properties, and in dentistry in dental cements. It is also used in ceramics, in glass manufacture, as a catalyst in organic synthesis, and in coated photocopy paper (Goodwin 1998). The largest uses of zinc chloride in the United States are in wood preservation, solder fluxes, and batteries. Solutions of zinc chloride are widely used in mercerizing cotton and as a mordant in dying. In medicine, zinc chloride is used as an antiseptic, disinfectant, deodorant, and in de ntal cements. Other uses are in organic synthesis, as a dehydrant, in rubber vulcanization, and in oil re fining (Goodwin 1998). Zinc chloride is a primary ingredient in smoke bombs used for crowd disper sal, in fire-fighting exercises (by both military and civilian communities), and by the military for screeni ng purposes (WHO 2001). Zinc sulfate is used in fertilizers, sprays, and animal feed as a trace elemen t and disease-control agent. It is used in the manufacture of rayon (as crenulating agent), as a starti ng material for many zinc chemicals, in textile dying and printing, in flotation reagents, for electrogalvanizing, in paper bleaching, and in glue (Goodwin 1998). Zinc sulfide is used as a phosphor (watches, TV screens), a white pigment, and in dental materials ZINC 136 5. PRODUCTION, IMPORT/EXPORT, USE, AND DISPOSAL Table 5-3.

Uses for zinc acetate are as a wood preservative, a mordant for antiseptics, a catalyst, and a waterproofing agent. Zinc cyanide has two uses: electroplating and gold extraction. The primary uses of zinc phosph ate are in preparation of metal coatings and as a dental cement (Goodwin 1998). Zinc chromate is u sed in pigments. Zinc hydroxide uses are as an intermediate, as an absorbent in surgical dressings, and in rubber compounding (Lewis 1997). 5.4 DISPOSAL Zinc processing plants have attempted to limit releases to the environment by using techniques such as water reuse, control of particulate emissions, and filtration thickener overflow . In addition, liquid effluents are limed and allowed to settle so that zinc can precipitate out as the hydroxide (Lloyd and Showak 1984). Waste products containing zinc are also being used as a source of zinc for electrogalvanizing (Jolly 1988). Disposal procedur es for spills include ferric hydroxide precipitation and cement-based fixation processes; the latter method is very effective in rendering zinc contaminants insoluble (Dawson and Mercer 1986). Unsalvageable zinc waste may be buried in an approved landfill while salvageable zinc is typically recycled. In 2 003, an estimated 370,000 tons of zinc were recovered from waste and scrap in the United States; about 30% was recovered in the form of slab zinc and the remainder was recovered in alloys, oxide, and chemical s. Of the total amount of scrap recycled, in 2002, 319,000 tons was derived from new scrap and 47,3 00 tons were derived from old scrap. About 25,000 tons of scrap in the United States were exported mainly to China, India, and Taiwan. Most of this scrap (95%) came from Canada (USGS 2003). In 1989, EPA applied its revised in terpretation of the Bevill Amendment (exclusion) to solid waste from the extraction, beneficiation, and processing of or es and minerals. The slag from the primary zinc processing is the only zinc-related waste rema ining in the Bevill exclusion (DOI 1991). ZINC 139 6. POTENTIAL FO R HUMAN EXPOSURE 6.1 OVERVIEW Zinc has been identified in at least 985 of the 1,662 hazardous waste sites that have been proposed for inclusion on the EPA National Priorities List (NPL) (HazDat 2005). However, the number of sites evaluated for zinc is not known. The frequency of these sites can be seen in Figure 6-1. Of these sites, 969 are located within the United States, and 2, 12, and 2 sites are located in the Commonwealth of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, respectively. Zinc is an element commonly found in the Earth's crust. It is released to the environment from both natural and anthropogenic sources; however, releases from anthropogenic sources are greater than those from natural sources. The primary anthropogenic sources of zinc in the environment (air, water, soil) are related to mining and metallurgic operations involving zinc and use of commercial products containing zinc. Worldwide, releases to soil are probably the great est source of zinc in the environment. The most important sources of anthropogenic zinc in soil come from discharges of smelter slags and wastes, mine tailings, coal and bottom fly ash, and the use of commercial products such as fertilizers and wood preservatives that contain zinc. Zinc does not vol atilize from soil. Although zinc usually remains adsorbed to soil, leaching has been reported at waste disposal sites. Zinc does not volatilize from water but is deposited primarily in sediments through adsorption and precipitation. Severe zinc contamination tends to be confined to areas near emission sources. Large amounts of contaminated soil would need to be ingested in order to reach the registered dietary inde x value of 3.3-3.8 mg of zinc a day. It is therefore unlikely that the zinc found in the contaminated soil would pose a health risk if ingested. Zinc is capable of forming complexes with a vari ety of organic and inorganic groups (ligands). Biological activity can affect the mobility of zinc in the aquatic environment, although the biota contains relatively little zinc compared to the sediments. Zinc bioconcentrates moderately in aquatic organisms; bioconcentration is higher in crustaceans and bivalve sp ecies than in fish. Zinc does not concentrate in plants, and it does not biomagnify through terrestrial food chains. In some fish, it has been observed that the level of zinc found in their bodies did not directly relate to the exposure concentrations. A recent study shows that bioaccu mulation of zinc in fish is inversely related to 140 ZINC 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Figure 6-1.

POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE the aqueous exposure (McGeer et al. 2003). This evidence suggests that fish placed in environments with lower zinc concentrations can sequester zinc in their bodies. There are few data regarding the speciation of zinc re leased to the atmosphere. Zinc is removed from the air by dry and wet deposition, but zinc particles with small diameters and low densities suspended in the atmosphere travel long distances from emission sources. Zinc has been detected in air, surface water, gr oundwater, and soil; the freque ncy of detection and the concentrations are greatest near source areas (e.g., haza rdous waste sites and industrial areas such as lead smelters). In a survey by the National Air Surveillan ce Network, the mean concentration of zinc in the air in the United States in 1977-1979 was 0.02-0.16 \u00b5g/m 3 for urban air compared to 0.01-0.05 \u00b5g/m3 for rural air. The concentrations of zinc in the air of remote areas range from <0.003 to 0.027 \u00b5g/m3. The mean concentrations of zinc in ambient water and drinking water range from 0.02 to 0.05 mg/L and from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/L, respectively. The concentration of zinc in drinking water can often be higher than the concentration in the raw water from which the dri nking water was obtained because zinc may leach from transmission and distribution pipes. The concentr ation of zinc in standing water from galvanized household water pipes was 1.3 mg/L (Sharrett et al. 1982a). The concentration of zinc in cultivated soils in the United States ranged from <5 to 400 mg/kg, with a mean of 36 mg/kg, compared to a range of <10- 2,000 mg/kg, with a mean of 51 mg/kg, in uncultivate d soils; this probably results from the differences in soils used for farming rather than the use of zinc in agriculture. Concentrations of zinc can be high in soils from contaminated sites, such as waste dumps. The concentrations of zinc in various foods and human tissues have also been determined. Certain population groups may be exposed to higher concentrati ons of zinc than the general population. People who work in coal mines, people who work with th e refining and smelting of nonferrous metals, and people who live near waste sites and metal smelting operations may be exposed to high levels of zinc. A study of the tissue of deceased copper smelter workers in Sweden showed that they had, on average, 58.9 and 31.5 mg/kg wet weight of zinc in the liver and kidney, respectively, as compared to the controls, who had 47.2 and 23.3 mg/kg wet weight of zinc in the liver and kidney, respectively. The controls, however, had a higher concentration of zinc in th e hair (233 mg/kg as opposed to the smelter workers who had 212 mg/kg) (Gerhardsson et al. 2002). People who consume large amounts of foods high in zinc content, such as oysters and mussels, may also be ex posed to elevated levels of zinc. The zinc body burdens of the copper smelter workers were not signifi cantly different than that of the controls. Higher exposure may or may not be manifested as increa sed body burden in the exposed individuals. ZINC 142 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE According to NHANES 1999-2000 dietary data, a larg e portion of obese people over the age of 50 are not getting the recommended amount of zinc (Bermudez et al. 2003). The RDA for zinc is 11 mg/day for men and 8 mg/day for women (see Section 3.1). Much of the human zinc intake comes from eating meat and meat products. A typical Italian diet contains abou t10.6 mg of dietary zinc per day, where 4.3 mg of zinc comes from meat and meat products (Lombardi-Bo ccia et al. 2003). Nonvegetarians absorb a higher percentage of zinc (3.7 mg/day) than vegetarians (2.4 mg/day) (Hunt 2003; Hunt et al. 1998). Infants also need zinc, and the RDA for zinc in pregnant and nursing mothers is 12 mg/day. A recent study of breast milk in lactating mothers showed an average zinc c oncentration of about 5.65 mg/L. This average did not vary much depending on the age of the mother (Honda et al. 2003). 6.2 RELEASES TO THE ENVIRONMENT The TRI data should be used with caution because onl y certain types of facilities are required to report (EPA 1997). This is not an exhaus tive list. Manufacturing and processing facilities are required to report information to the Toxics Release Inventory only if they employ 10 or more full-time employees; if their facility is classified under Standard Industrial Classi fication (SIC) codes 20-39; and if their facility produces, imports, or processes 25,000 pounds of any TRI chemical or otherwise uses >10,000 pounds of a TRI chemical in a calendar year (EPA 1997). Zinc is commonly found in the earth's crust, and natural releases to the environment can be significant. In addition, zinc is one of the most widely used metals in the world. The major industrial sources of zinc include electroplating, smelting and ore processing, and drainage from both active and inactive mining operations (Mirenda 1986). Furtherm ore, zinc is an important component of brass, bronze, die casting metal, other alloys, rubber, and paints. The environmental releases of zinc from sources of human origin far exceed the releases from natural sources (Fishbein 1981). 6.2.1 Air Estimated releases of 0.91 million pounds (~413 metric tons) of zinc to the atmosphere from 389 domestic manufacturing and processing facilities in 2002, accounted for about 1.9% of the estimated total environmental releases from fa cilities required to report to the TRI (TRI02 2004). These releases are summarized in Table 6-1. ZINC 143 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Table 6-1.

RF = reporting facilities; UI = underground injection ZINC 145 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Natural emissions of zinc and its compounds to air are mainly due to windborne soil particles, volcanic emissions, and forest fires. The global flux of zinc due to erosion is estimated to be 915,000 tonnes/year; of this total, 681,000 tonnes comes from high-temperature thermal vents in mid-ocean ridges (WHO 2001). Volcanic release of zinc has been estimated to be around 35,800 tonnes/year (Lantzy 1979). The eruption of Mt. Pinatubo alone released an estimated 800,000 tonnes of zinc into the atmosphere in 1991 (Garrett 2000). Other natural sources of zinc in air are biogenic emissions and sea salt sprays with annual amounts estimated to be 8,100 and 440 metr ic tons, respectively (Nriagu 1989). Anthropogenic releases of zinc and its compounds to the atmosphere are from dust and fumes from mining, zinc production facilities, processing of zinc -bearing raw materials (e.g., lead smelters), brass works, coal and fuel combustion, refuse incinerati on, and iron and steel production (EPA 1980d; Ragaini et al. 1977). In urban East St. Louis, Illinois, indust rial complexes, such as sm elters, accounted for about 86% of fine and course particulate matter emitted into air. In southeastern Chicago, Illinois, incinerator emissions accounted for 86% of fine particulate in the atmosphere while urban dust account for 93% of the course particulate emissions (Sweet et al. 1993). Es timated atmospheric zinc loss is 100 g/ton of zinc mined, and most of the loss comes from handling ra w and concentrated ore and wind erosion of tailing piles (Lloyd and Showak 1984). Average zinc emissions to the atmosphere from stationary sources in the United States were 151,000 tons/year (137,000 metric tons/year) for 1969-1971 (Fishbein 1981). Based on emission studies in Western Europe, the United Stat es, Canada, and the former Soviet Union, total worldwide zinc emissions to air were calculated to range from 70,250 to 193,500 metric tons in 1983. Emissions from the nonferrous metal industry account for the largest fraction of zinc emitted (50-70%) (Nriagu and Pacyna 1988). However, emissions have decreased considerably since the 1970s and 1980s as a result of improvements in contemporary zinc pr oduction facilities. Zinc emissions decreased 73% for air and 83% for water during the years 1985-1995 (WHO 2001). According to the TRI, estimated totals of 910,964 pounds (413 metric tons) of zinc (dust and fume) and 6,415,067 pounds (2,909 metric tons) of zinc compounds, amounting to about 1.9 and 0.92%, respectively, of the total environmental on-site rele ases, were discharged into the atmosphere in the United States in 2001 from mining, manufacturing, processing, and electrical power generation industries listed in Tables 6-1 and 6- 2 (TRI02 2004). Data for stack/point source emissions indicate releases of 495,206 pounds (224 metric tons) of zinc (dust and fu me) and 4,617,457 pounds (2,094 metric tons) of zinc compounds, while data for fugitive source emissi on indicate a release of 375,586 pounds (170 metric tons) of zinc (dust and fume) and 1,542,235 pounds ( 700 metric tons) of zinc compounds.

This is not an exhaustive list. Zinc has been identified in air at 37 sites collected from the 985 NPL hazardous waste sites where it was detected in some environmental media (HazDat 2005). 6.2.2 Water Estimated releases of 0.059 million pounds of zinc to surface water from 389 domestic manufacturing and processing facilities in 2002, accounted for about 0.1% of the estimated total environmental releases (TRI02 2004). This value includes the amount that was released to publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) (TRI02 2004). These releases are summarized in Table 6-1. Zinc and its compounds are found in the earth's crust a nd are present in most rocks, certain minerals, and some carbonate sediments. As a result of weathering of these materials, soluble compounds of zinc are formed and may be released to water (NAS 1977). The largest input of zinc to water results from erosion of soil particles containing natural traces of zinc (45,400 metric tons/yea r) (EPA 1980d). Erosion resulting from human activities accounts for 70% of this soil loss; geologic or natural erosion constitutes the other 30% (EPA 1980d). However, this source of low levels of zinc is widely dispersed and is, therefore, unlikely to elevate aquatic concentrations significantly. Zinc flux to the oceans from high temperature hydrothermal fluids in mid-ocean ridges has been estimated to be approximately 681,000 metric tons/year (WHO 2001). Urban runoff, mine drainage, and municipal and indust rial effluents are smaller but more concentrated sources of zinc in water. Davis et al. (2001) estimated the zinc loadings in urban storm water runoff. In this study, buildings and automobiles were found to contribute 95% of loadings (0.646 kg/ha/year) to storm water runoff in urban environments. Data fro m this study are summarized in Table 6-3. The Nationwide Urban Runoff Program (NURP), initiated to evaluate the significance of priority pollutants in urban storm water runoff, reports a frequency of detection for zinc of 95%, with a concentration range of 0.01-2.4 mg/L (Cole et al. 1984). Industries that discharge large quantities of zinc directly to water include iron and steel, zinc smelting, plastics, a nd electroplating (EPA 1980d). The arithmetic mean concentration of zinc in influents of 239 waste wate r treatment plants in the United States was 0.7 mg/L, with minimum and maximum concentrations of 0.0001 and 28.7 mg/L, respectively (Minear et al. 1981). Accidental zinc discharges to water are most often asso ciated with smelting and refining operations. Zinc ZINC 149 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Table 6-3.

POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE is present with cadmium and lead in these pro cesses (NAS 1977). Urban runoff and drainage from inactive mines account for approximately 5,250 and 4,060 metric tons/year, respectively, of the total releases of zinc to water (EPA 1980d). Drainage from active mining areas is considerably less than from inactive areas because of the disposal methods currently employed. Hazardous waste sites, in which zinc has been improperly disposed of, are additional sources of the element. Metals, such as zinc, also enter estuaries from many natural and manufactured sources. Three important sources of zinc input into surface water are meta l manufacturing (33,000-178, 000 metric tons/year), domestic waste water (21,000-58,000 metric tons/year), and atmospheric fallout (2,600-31,000 metric tons/year). On an annual worldwide basis, an estimated 77,000-375,000 metric tons of zinc are discharged into water from anthropogenic sources (Nri agu and Pacyna 1988). P ublicly owned treatment works are the largest total point source for zinc discharges. Publicly owned treatment works receive zinc contributions from the water supply and distribution system corrosion, combined sewer area runoff, industrial wastes, and human excrement (EPA 1980d). Crawford et al. (1995) reported the direct inputs of zinc contamination to the Newark Bay Estuary as follows (kg/day): municipal treatment systems, 272.0; industry, 14.34; combined sewer overflows, 141 .5; storm water runoff, 164.6; and tributary flow, 307. Indirect inputs were 934.7 kg/day. The flux of zinc into the Hudson River Estuary from sewage has decreased from 924 kg/day in 1974 to 285 kg/day in 1997 as a result of improvements in controlling discharges from municipal and industrial waste wate r treatment plants since the Clean Water Act was enacted in 1972 (Sanudo-Wilhelmy and Gill 1999). According to the TRI, estimated totals of 58,525 pounds (26.5 metric tons) of zinc (dust and fume) and 3,109,033 pounds (1,410 metric tons) of zinc compounds, amounting to about 0.1 and 0.44%, respectively, of the total environmental on-site rele ases, were discharged into surface water in the United States in 2002 from mining, manufacturing, processing, and electrical power generation industries listed in Tables 6-1 and 6-2. Estimated totals of 0 poun ds (0 metric tons) of zinc (dust and fume) and 13,946,427 pounds (6,325 metric tons) of zinc co mpounds, amounting to about 0.0 and 2% of the total environmental on-site releases, respectively, were injected underground in the United States in 2001 from mining, manufacturing, processing, and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)/Solvent Recovery industries listed in Tables 6-1 and 6-2 (TRI 02 2004). The TRI data should be used with caution since only certain facilities are required to re port. This is not an exhaustive list. The concentration of zinc in drinking water may increase as a result of the distribution system and household plumbing (EPA 1987c). Common piping mate rials used in distribution systems often contain ZINC 151 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE zinc, as well as other metals and alloys. Trace metals may enter the water through corrosion products or simply by the dissolution of small amounts of metals with which the water comes in contact. Reactions with materials of the distribution system, particularly in soft low-pH waters, very often have produced concentrations of zinc in tap water much greater than those in the raw or treated waters at the plant of origin (NAS 1977). The total quantity of annual releases of zinc from these sources has not been estimated. Environmental toxicity of zinc in water is dependent upon the concen tration of other minerals and the pH of the solution, which affect the ligands that associate with zinc (Heijerick et al. 2002a; Paquin et al. 2002; Santore 2002). Zinc has been identified in surface water and groundw ater at 393 and 685 sites, respectively, collected from the 985 NPL hazardous waste sites where it was detected in some environmental media (HazDat 2005). 6.2.3 Soil Estimated releases of 37 million p ounds (16,856 metric tons) of zinc to soils from 389 domestic manufacturing and processing facilities in 2002, acco unted for about 79% of the estimated total environmental releases from facilities required to report to the TRI (TRI02 2004). No material was released via underground injection (TRI02 2004). These releases are summarized in Table 6-1. Limited information is available on total releases of zi nc to soil. Zinc is of ten present in soils and grasses as a result of atmospheric deposition. Furthermore, approximately 22,000 tons (20,000 metric tons) of zinc is used in fertilizers each year in the United States (NAS 1977). The extent to which zinc may run off into soil, rivers, and streams has not been eval uated. Hazardous waste sites are additional sources of zinc in soil. Municipal sludges applied to cropland soils can also be an important source of trace metals, including zinc (Chang et al. 1987). On a worldwide basis, an estimated 1,193,000-3,294,000 me tric tons of zinc per year are released to soil from anthropogenic sources (Nriagu and Pacyna 1988). The four most important sources of zinc in soil were estimated to be smelter slugs and wastes, mine tailings, coal and bottom fly ash, and the discharge of commercial products such as fertilizers. Tire debris contains significant quantities of zinc, whic h may contaminate soils near roads. For example, snow collected on soil near an expressway in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec (Canada) contained higher levels zinc ZINC 152 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE near the expressway. At 15 m from expressway, a snow pack concentration of 0.143 mg/L was measured, while at 150 m from the expressway, the concentration of zinc in snow was 0.029 mg/L (Loranger et al. 1996). Laboratory experiments indicated that a signi ficant fraction of zinc may be released from tire rubber debris. Soil pH limits the mobilization of zinc in soil. Thus, zinc from tire debris will be less available and become immobile with soil interactions (Smolders and Degryse 2002). Metallic zinc may yield soluble zinc compounds und er acidic conditions where the zinc hydroxide- carbonate layer is attacked from pollutants such as sulfur dioxide. Metallic zinc is washed off slowly and forms a diffuse source of zinc release to soils. Other releases of zinc include the use of sacrificial anodes in soil to protect steel structures from corrosion (WHO 2001). According to the TRI, estimated totals of 37,167,881 pounds (16,856 metric tons) of zinc (dust and fume) and 589,805,136 pounds (267,485 metric tons) of zinc compounds, amounting to about 79 and 85%, respectively, of the total environmental on-site releas es, were released to land in the United States in 2001 from mining, manufacturing, processing, and electrical power generation industries (Tables 6-1 and 6-2) (TRI02 2004). Another 12,924,002 pounds (5,861 metric tons) of zinc (dust and fume) and 211,434,474 pounds (95,889 me tric tons) of zinc compounds were transferred to off-site treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. The TRI data shoul d be used with caution since only certain types of facilities are required to report. This is not an exhaustive list. Zinc has been identified in soil and sediment at 522 and 370 sites, respectively, collected from the 985 NPL hazardous waste sites where it was detect ed in some environmental media (HazDat 2005). 6.3 ENVIRONMENTAL FATE Zinc occurs in the environment mainly in the +2 ox idation state (Lindsay 1979). Sorption is the dominant reaction, resulting in the enrichment of zinc in suspended and bed sediments (EPA 1979d). Zinc in aerobic waters is partitioned into thro ugh sorption onto hydrous iron and manganese oxides, clay minerals, and organic material. The efficiency of these materials in removing zinc from solution varies according to their concentrations, pH, redox potential (Eh), salinity, nature and concentrations of complexing ligands, cation exchange capacity, and the con centration of zinc. Precipitation of soluble zinc compounds appears to be significant only under reducing conditions in highly polluted water. Generally, at lower pH values, zinc remains as the free ion. The free ion (Zn +2) tends to be adsorbed and transported by suspended solids in unpolluted wate rs. In polluted waters in which th e concentration of zinc is high, ZINC 153 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE removal of zinc by precipitation of the hydroxide is possible, particularly when the pH is >8 (EPA 1979d). In anaerobic environments and in the presence of sulfide ions, precipitation of zinc sulfide limits the mobility of zinc. The relative mobility of zinc in soil is determined by the same factors that affect its transport in aquatic systems (i.e., solubility of the compound, pH, and salinity) (Clement 1985). Zinc is an essential nutrient that is present in a ll organisms. Although biota appears to be a minor reservoir of zinc relative to soils and sediments, mi crobial decomposition of biota in water can produce ligands, such as humic acids, that can affect the mobility of zinc in the aquatic environment through zinc precipitation and adsorption (EPA 1979d). Zinc concentrations in the air are relatively low, except near industrial sources such as smelters. No estimate for the atmospheric lifetime of zinc is available at this time, but the fact that zinc is transported long distances in air indicates that its lifetime in air is at least on the order of days. 6.3.1 Transport and Partitioning Air. In the atmosphere, zinc exists primarily in an ox idized form bound to aerosols, with the size of zinc particulates determined by the source of zinc emis sion (Nriagu and Davidson 1980; Sweet et al. 1993). A major proportion of zinc released from industrial processes is adsorbed on particulates that are small enough to be in the respirable range (Dorn et al. 1976). Wind-blown dust transports zinc bound to soil particulates into the atmosphere (EPA 1980d). The pa rticulates may also contain other materials (Pacyna et al. 1989; Saltzman et al. 1985). Zinc-bearing particles in the atmosphere are trans ported to soil and water by wet deposition (rain and snow) and dry deposition (gravitational settling and deposition on wate r and soil surfaces). Zinc particles with low dry deposition velocities (i.e., particles with small diameters and low densities) can be transported from their emission source to distant regions (Pacyna et al. 1989). The atmospheric wet deposition of zinc (and other trace metals) was examined at two Maryland Chesapeake Bay sites from June 1990 to July 1991 as part of the Chesapeake Bay Atmospheric Deposition Study (Scudlark et al. 1994). The average annual wet deposition at these two sites was 1,335 \u00b5g/m2/year with 99% attributed to anthropogenic sources. As part of the Atmosphe ric Exchange over Lakes and Oceans Study (AEOLOS), dry deposition fluxes of zinc were measured over the southern basin of Lake Michigan near the urban area of Chicago and the nonurban area of South Haven, Michigan (Paode et al. 1998). In 1993, the average measured zinc fluxes were 200 \u00b5g/m 2/day in Chicago; 10 \u00b5g/m2/day over southern Lake ZINC 154 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Michigan; and 4 \u00b5g/m2/day in South Haven, Michigan. Between 1993 and 1995, Shahin et al. (2000) estimated the dry deposition flux of zinc in Chicago to be 4.4x104 \u00b5g/m2/year. Atmospheric deposition rates of zinc for Lakes Superior, Erie, and On tario were reported to be 3,310, 2,180, and 5,650 \u00b5g/m2/year, respectively (Nriagu et al. 1996). Detec tion of zinc in rain waters confirms the importance of wet precipitation in the removal of zi nc particles from the atmosphere (Aten et al. 1983; Colin et al. 1990; Dasch and Wolff 1989; Golomb et al. 1997; Heaton et al. 1990). Golomb et al. (1997) measured the atmospheric deposition of zinc at Nahant, Massachusetts (near urban area of Boston) and at Truro, Massachusetts (on Cape Cod) for the years 1992-1993. Results indicated that wet deposition was a significant fraction of the total atmospheric depositi on of zinc for Nahant (28%) and Truro (40%). Water. In water, zinc occurs in the environment primar ily in the +2 oxidation state. It dissolves in acids to form hydrated Zn+2 cations and in strong bases to form zin cate which are and (Zn[OH] 4[H2O]2)2- (O'Neil et al. 2001). In most waters, zinc exists primarily as the hydrated form of the divalent cation. However, the metal often forms complexes with a variety of organic and inorganic ligands (EPA 1979d, 1984b, 1987c). Zinc can occur in both suspended and dissolved form s in surface water. Dissolv ed zinc may occur as the free (hydrated) zinc ion or as dissolved complexes and compounds with varying degrees of stability. Suspended (i.e., undissolved) zinc may be dissolved with changes in water conditions (e.g., pH, redox potential, solution speciation) or may sorb on to suspended matter. Gundersen and Steinnes (2003) reported that <10% of zinc was sorbed on particles or colloids in river water from two rivers with average pHs of 3.1 and 5.1 (rivers with mining activity near Roes, Norway), whereas 21% of zinc occurred in sorbed form in six pH neutral rivers. In the aquatic environment, zinc partitions to sedim ents or suspended solids in surface waters through sorption onto hydrous iron and manganese oxides, clay minerals, and organic material. Reservoirs located downstream from lead-zinc mining and milling ar eas were found to contain higher concentrations of zinc than reservoirs in other areas, and the zi nc was more highly concentrated in reservoir bottom sediments than in the surrounding soils (Pita and Hyne 1975). In addition, the zinc content in sediment closely correlated with the depth, organic content, an d clay content of the sediments. Phosphates and iron hydroxides affect the transfer of metals (including zi nc) from river water to the sediments, according to a study by Houba et al. (1983). In this study, zi nc was bound predominantly to carbonate and amorphous matter (iron, aluminum, and manganese hydroxides). In addition, mobile components of naturally occurring organic matter contributed to the increase in the metal hydroxide-bound fraction. ZINC 155 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE The transport of zinc in the aquatic environment is controlled by anion species. In natural waters, complexing agents, such as humic acid, can bind zinc. The stability of zinc complexes depends on the pH of the water and the nature of the complex. The dissociation of the complex may determine the amount of free zinc ions in solution. Zinc-humic acid complexes may be 50% dissociated at pH 5.5 and the dissociation rate may be higher as the pH decreases (Guy and Chakrabarti 1976). Therefore, as the pH of the water decreases, the concentration of zinc ions in the water phase increases at the same rate as that of the release of zinc from the sediment. The magnesium found in the silicate minerals of igneous rocks is often replaced with the divalent zinc ion; consequent ly, weathering of this zinc-containing bedrock gives rise to Zn +2 in solution. The hydrated cation is the dominant form when the pH is 9 (EPA 1979d). The tendency of zinc to be sorbed is affected not only by the nature and concentration of the sorbent but also by pH and salinity (EPA 1979d). Zinc tends to so rb more readily at a high pH (pH >7) than at a low pH (EPA 1979d). Desorption of zinc from sediments occurs as salinity increases (Helz et al. 1975), apparently because of displacement of the adsorbed zinc ions by alkali and alkaline earth cations, which are abundant in brackish and saline waters (EPA 1979d). In column leaching tests with sediment collected from the banks of the Rhone River, the presence of dissolved organic matter and pH was found to be the factors controlling the adsorption and mobility of zinc (Bourg and Darmendrail 1992). A small fraction of zinc will exist in the aquatic phase as soluble inorganic zinc compounds (e.g., zinc chloride, zinc sulfate). Soluble inorganic zinc compounds hydrolyze in solution, forming zinc hydroxide precipitates. Hydrolysis may lower pH, but the buffe ring action present in most natural water prevents a significant alteration in pH. The precipitation of zinc hydroxide and zinc carbonate was studied by Patterson et al. (1977), who found that zinc hydroxi de precipitates faster than zinc carbonate. Zinc carbonate is soluble in pure water at 25 \u00b0C at concentrations of 107 mg zinc/L. The hydroxide is soluble only at concentrations of 0.2 mg zinc/L. As a result, some of the inorganic forms of zinc that are expected to be present in water are basic carbonate (Zn 2[OH] 2CO 3), 4) (Florence 1980; NAS 1977). When the pH is 8, most of these compounds will precipitate; however, as the pH decreases, more and more of these compounds will dissolve and remain in the water phase (EPA 1979d). The effect of pH on the mobilization of zinc in a few highly acidic clean lakes has been studied (Sprenger et al. 1987; White and Driscoll 1987). In these lakes, in which the pH was 3.6, concentrations of zinc were elevated in the water column , and the concentration of zinc in the upper layer of sediment was ZINC 156 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE substantially lower than values reported for other lakes at higher pH values. The relatively higher concentration of zinc in the water column compared to the sediment may be the result of lower adsorption of zinc on oxide surfaces due to low pH, solubilization of inorganic zinc from the sediment layer, and the dissociation of bound organic complexes of zinc present in the sediment and their subsequent release into the water phase. The precipitation of zinc sulfide affects the mobility of zinc in reducing environments, especially when hydrogen sulfide is formed. The precipitation of the hydroxide, carbonate, or basic sulfate may become more significant at high concentrations of zinc. Hesterberg et al. (1997) reports that zinc (hydr)oxides and not sulfides are the dominant species in aquife rs solids under reducing conditions. The hydroxides and hydrous oxides of iron and manganese are often co mponents of the clay fraction of sediments and often exist as coatings on the surfaces of other mine rals (NAS 1977). Zinc may coprecipitate with hydrous oxides when reduced iron or manganese oxides are oxidized. As the new solids are formed, they can trap various ions in their crystal lattices (EPA 1979d). Soil. The redox status of the soil may shift zinc partitioning. Reductive dissolution of iron and manganese (hydr)oxides under suboxic conditions release zi nc into the aqueous phase; the persistence of suboxic conditions may then lead to a repartitioning of zinc into sulfide and carbonate solids. Bostick et al. (2001) describe zinc speciation in contaminated wetland soil that undergoes seasonal flooding. In dry oxidized soils, the authors found that zinc was asso ciated with (hydr)oxide phases, while in flooded systems, zinc was associated with sulfides and carbonates. Reversib le change occurred with flooding from dry soil. However, a small fraction of zinc became recalcitrant with (hydr)oxides fraction. Zinc sorbs strongly onto soil particulates. Little water-soluble and exchangeable heavy metals were found in soil irrigated with raw waste water (Schalscha et al. 1982). Although considerable amounts of metals were added to the soil in soluble and exchang eable forms during waste-water irrigation, they were converted into the less chemically active forms (i.e ., organically bonded and inorganic precipitates). Further examination showed that zinc accumulati on in soil resulting from waste disposal occurred primarily as inorganic precipitates. The mobility of zinc in soil depends on the solubilit y of the speciated forms of the element and on soil properties such as cation exchange capacity, pH, red ox potential, and chemical species present in soil; under anaerobic conditions, zinc sulfide is the controlling species (EPA 1980d; Kalbasi et al. 1978). Since zinc sulfide is insoluble, the mobility of zinc in anaerobic soil is low. In a study of the effect of pH ZINC 157 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE on zinc solubility, Saeed and Fox (1977) showed that, when the pH is <7, an inverse relationship exists between the pH and the amount of zinc in solution. As negative charges on soil surfaces increase with increasing pH, additional sites for zinc adsorption ar e activated and the amount of zinc in solution decreases. The active zinc species in the adsorbed state is the singly charged zinc hydroxide species (i.e., Zn[OH]+) (Sanders and Kherbawy 1987). Other investigator s have also shown that the mobility of zinc in soil increases at lower soil pH under oxidizing conditions and at a lower cation exchange capacity of soil (Bergkvist et al. 1989; Hermann a nd Neumann-Mahlkau 1985; Tyler and McBride 1982). On the other hand, the amount of zinc in solution generally increases wh en the pH is >7 in soils high in organic matter. This is a result of the release of organically complexe d zinc, reduced zinc adsorption at higher pH, or an increase in the concentration of chelating agents in soil (Saeed and Fox 1977). For calcareous soils, the relationship between zinc solubility a nd pH is nonlinear. At a high pH, zinc in solution is precipitated as Zn(OH) 2, zinc carbonate (ZnCO 3), or calcium zincate (Saeed and Fox 1977). Clay and metal oxides are capable of sorbing zinc and tend to retard its mobility in soil. Warwick et al. (1998) studied the mobility of zinc ions in sand. Zinc was more mobile at pH 4 than at pH 6.5 as a consequence of sorption. Goethite (i.e., iron oxyhydroxide) caused a greater decrease in mobility, and increased retardation was also observed with humic acid. Distribution constants (K d=concentration of sorbed zinc/concentration of zinc in solution) for zinc in soil range widely from 0.1 to 8,000 L/kg (or mL/g) (Baes and Sharp 1983; et al. 1997; Gerritse et al. 1982; Janssen et al. 1997). K d values of 100\u00b1770 mL/g for sandy loam soil and 0.2\u00b14 mL/g for sandy soils were reported by Gerritse et al. (1982). K d values ranging from 0.1 to 8,000 mL/g were reported by Baes and Sharp (1983). K d values for zinc of 140 and 41 L/kg were determined for the O-horizon (organic layer) and E-hori zon (silty sand), respectively, of a podzol forest soil (Bunzl and Schimmack 1989). Field-based K p ranged from 6 to 6,762 L/kg for 20 Dutch agricultural soils (Janssen et al. 1997). K d values for nine soils treated with sewage sludge supernatant ranged from 0.034 to 1.359 L/g at pH 4.5 while at pH 6.5, K d values ranged from 0.425 to 2.896 L/g (Gao et al. 1997). Zinc in a soluble form (e.g., zinc sulfate) is moderately mobile in most soils. However, relatively little land-disposed zinc at waste sites is in the soluble form. Thus, mobility is limited by a slow rate of dissolution. Consequently, movement towards groundwater is expected to be slow unless zinc is applied to soil in soluble form (such as in agricultural app lications) or accompanied by corrosive substances (such as in mine tailings) (EPA 1980d). Yet, soil conditions not suitable for zinc sorption may lead to leaching. Low pH (pH <7) and high ionic strength of the leach ing solution favor desorption (EPA 1987c; Saeed and Fox 1977). ZINC 158 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Consequently, zinc primarily remains in recalcitrant, immobile forms in contaminated soils (Chlopecka et al. 1996; Kabala and Singh and Rao 1997a). Ma and Rao (1997) studied the chemical fractionation of zinc in nine soils from various U.S. locations contaminated by agriculture and industrial activities. Zinc was found to be concentrated in the residual (or recalcitrant) fraction (range, 55.8-97.6%), which reflected greater tendency of zinc to become unavailable once in soils. However, some zinc was found in exchang eable and carbonate fractions at levels ranging from 0.73 to 25%, which suggests that some zinc may be available to plants. In soil from East St. Louis, Illinois, an area heavily contaminated with metals, se quential extraction analysis of soil revealed that the largest fraction of zinc was partitioned in the iron-manganese oxide fraction (47.2%) followed by carbonate (37.9%) and organic (14.1%) and exchangeable (0.8%) fractions (Kam iniski and Landsberger 2000b). Kabala and Singh (2001) reported that wate r-soluble zinc was present in only very small amounts (<1%) in most contaminated soils. Howeve r, concentrations of exchangeable zinc were significantly higher in surface horizons (4-19% of total zinc) than in subsurface layers. In subsurface horizons of the studied soils, zinc was concentrated in the residual (or recalcitrant) fraction. The percentage of residual zinc ranged from 45% in silt y soils to 94% in clay-loam soil. The nonresidual fractions prevailed only in the surface horizons in both contaminated and uncontaminated soil (65-91% of total zinc) (Kabala and Singh 2001). Soils from Southwestern Poland subjected to severe metal contamination contained zinc at concentrations ranging from 20 to 10,000 mg/kg (Chlopecka et al. 1996). Acidic soils (pH<5.6) contained a greater fraction of exchangeable zinc, while for other soils (pH>5.6), zinc was found primarily in the oxide and residual (or recalcitrant) fractions with moderate amounts in the organic, carbonate, and exchangeable forms. Zinc is an essential nutrient and occurs in the tissues of organisms, even at normal ambient water and soil concentrations. Zinc can accumulate in freshwate r animals at 51-1,130 times the concentration present in the water (EPA 1987c). Microcosm studies indicate, in general, that zinc does not biomagnify through food chains (Biddinger and Gloss 1984; EPA 1979d; Hegstrom and West 1989). Furthermore, although zinc actively bioaccumulates in aquatic systems, biota appears to represent a relatively minor sink compared to sediments. Steady-state zinc bioconcentration factors (BCFs) for 12 aquatic species range from 4 to 24,000 (EPA 1987c). Crustaceans and fish can accumulate zinc from both water and food. A BCF of 1,000 was reported for both aquatic plants and fish, and a value of 10,000 was reported for aquatic invertebrates (Fishbein 1981). The order of en richment of zinc in different aquatic organisms was as follows (zinc concentrations in \u00b5g/g dry weight appear in parentheses): fish (25), shrimp (50), mussel (60), periphyton (260), zooplankton (330), and oyster (3,300) (Ramelow et al. 1989). The high ZINC 159 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE enrichment in oysters may be due to their ingestion of particulate matter containing higher concentrations of zinc than ambient water. Other investigators have also indicated that organisms associated with sediments have higher zinc concentrations than or ganisms living in the aqueous layer (Biddinger and Gloss 1984). With respect to bioconcentration from soil by terrestrial plants, invertebrates, and mammals, BCFs of 0.4, 8, and 0.6, respectively, have been reported. The concentration of zinc in plants depends on the plant species, soil pH, and the composition of the soil (Dudka and Chlopecka 1990; Rudd et al. 1988). Plant species do not concentrate zinc above the levels present in soil (Levine et al. 1989). 6.3.2 Transformation and Degradation As an element, zinc does not degrade in the environm ent. Degradation of an element is a nuclear process by definition, and stable elements, such as zinc, typically undergo such processes only at insignificant rates in the environment. Zinc can change from one form to another, sometimes reversibly, in numerous chemical reactions that can proceed under a wide range of common envi ronmental conditions. 6.3.2.1 Air The chemical interaction of zinc compounds in the atmosphere may change the anionic speciation of the compound. Atmospheric interactions are greatest for particles with small aerodynamic diameters (Fishbein 1981). Zinc is found in the atmosphere at the highest concentrations in the smallest particles (Fishbein 1981). Atmospheric emissions of zinc, consisting primarily of zinc sorbed to submicron particulate matter in the form of zinc oxide (ZnO), are expected to dissipate quickly as a result of deposition to soil and surface waters (EPA 1980d). In the atmosphere, zinc-bearing particles may underg o chemical transformation before deposition. The association of zinc particles in aerosols in Arizona was studied, and five zinc-bearing particles were identified with an automated scanning electron micro scope (Anderson et al. 1988). These particles, in decreasing order of concentration in the aerosol , were zinc sulfide (ZnS), chloride (ZnCl 2), and metallic zinc (Zn). The presence of zinc sulfide in an area adjacent to mining and smelting activities was not unanticipated, but no conclusion regarding the speciation of zinc in the atmosphere could be drawn from this investigation. However, the relative concentration of zinc ions in rainwater from a rural area was approximately 10 times higher than in ZINC 160 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE airborne particulates (Aten et al. 1983). This finding suggests that zinc sulfide in the atmosphere is oxidized to a more water-soluble form, zinc sulfate. 6.3.2.2 Water Zinc is in the +2 form in aqueous solution and e xhibits amphoteric properties; zinc metal and compounds dissolve in acids to form hydrated Zn+2 cations and in strong bases to form zincate anions, are hydroxo and [Zn(OH) 4(H2O)2]2- (EPA 1979d; O'Neil et al. 2001). However, at the pH of most natural waters, the formation of anionic zinc species is not likely. A small part of the available zinc may partition into the aquatic phase through the formation of soluble zinc chloride and sulfate compounds. These compounds hydrolyze in solution to form the hydroxide or hydrated zinc oxide precipitate with a resultant d ecrease in pH. The decrease in pH can increase the solubility of zinc hydroxide and increase the zinc con centration in water. However, the buffering action of most natural waters prevents any significant change of pH due to the hydrolysis reactions. As a result, in the water phase, the solubility of its carbonate and hydr oxide is likely to control the availability of zinc. It was reported by Patterson et al. (1977) that Zn(OH) 2 precipitates faster than ZnCO 3. Zinc is not directly affected by changes in Eh; however, the va lences and reactivity of ligands reacting with zinc are affected by Eh. Zinc is an active reduci ng agent for many metal permanganate (MnO 4-2) ions (Stokinger 1981). As a reactions, the manganese oxides and ferric salts may precipitate and, in the pr ocess, may entrap soluble zinc in the precipitate, thereby reducing the zinc con centration in the water phase. Because alkyl zinc compounds are unstable in water and oxygen, biomethylation of zinc compounds in aquatic ecosystems probably does not occur (EPA 1979d). Insoluble zinc compounds (e.g., zinc oxide) are solubilized indirectly under anaerobic conditions with reduction of iron sulfides, which reduces the solution pH (Couillard et al. 1994; Francis and D odge 1988). No evidence was found that photolysis in the aquatic environment significantly affects the fate of zinc compounds. 6.3.2.3 Sediment and Soil Zinc undergoes reactions in sediment and soil involvi ng precipitation/dissolution, complexation/dissocia\u00ad tion, and adsorption/desorption. These reactions are controlled by the pH, redox potential (Eh), the ZINC 161 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE concentration of zinc ions and other ions in the soil pore water, the number and type of adsorption sites associated with the solid phase, and the organic ligands present that are capable of forming complexes with zinc. In acidic sediments and soils, more zinc is available in ionic forms, and cation exchange processes influence its fate. Depending on the nature and concentrations of ot her mobile metals in sediments and soils, competition for the binding sites probably occurs. In the absence of suitable binding sites, zinc may be mobilized (ICF 1986). In alka line soils, the chemistry of zinc is dominated by interactions with organic ligands. The ecological t oxicity of sediment is complex and appears to be correlated to the ratio of zinc to acid volatile sulfide (B erry et al. 1996; Di Toro et al. 1992; Sibley et al. 1996). Biological degradation of zinc complexes in soil is necessary for the normal operation of ecosystems to facilitate the recycling of zinc from litter, feces, and de ad organisms. In some environments, bacteria and fungi are able to oxidize zinc sulfide producing zinc sulfate, which will solubilize in the soil solution (WHO 2001). 6.3.2.4 Other Media During composting of organic wastes, zinc remains in mobile and bioavailable forms. Zinc carbonates are formed, although not at the expense of zinc sulfide levels, which remain unaltered during the composing process (Ciba et al. 1997). No further data were located in the literature for the transformation and degradation of zinc in other media. 6.4 LEVELS MONITORED OR ESTIMATED IN THE ENVIRONMENT Reliable evaluation of the potential for human exposure to zinc depends in part on the reliability of supporting analytical data from environmental samples a nd biological specimens. Concentrations of zinc in unpolluted atmospheres and in pristine surface waters are often so low as to be near the limits of current analytical methods. In reviewing data on zinc levels monitored or estimated in the environment, it should also be noted that the amount of chemical identified analytically is not necessarily equivalent to the amount that is bioavailable. The analytical methods available for monitoring zinc in a variety of environmental media are detailed in Chapter 7. ZINC 162 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 6.4.1 Air Zinc concentrations in air are relatively low and fair ly constant except near sources such as smelters. Average atmospheric concentrations of zinc resulti ng from releases from automobiles, fuel combustion, incineration, soil erosion, and industrial, commerc ial, and construction activ ity throughout the United States generally are <1 \u00b5g/m3 (EPA 1980d; Lloyd and Showak 1984). In 1990, the median concentration of zinc in air samples collected across Minnesota was 0.012 \u00b5g/m3 (maximum, 0.187 \u00b5g/m3) (Pratt et al. 2000). At six measurement sites in Columbus, Ohio, the mean atmospheric particulate concentration of zinc for samples collected in 1989 was 0.01\u00b10.01 \u00b5g/m3 (Spicer et al. 1996). Data on zinc concentrations in New York City during 1972-1975 show that the average atmospheric zinc concentration ranged from 0.293 to 0.380 \u00b5g/m3 annually (Lioy et al. 1978). An average ambient zinc concentration of 0.127 \u00b5g/m3 (concentration range, 0.027-0.500 \u00b5g/m3) was determined from analyses of particulate samples collected at nine air monitoring sites in the San Francisco Bay area (John et al. 1973). The concentrations of zinc in atmospheric samples collected from seven cities in the United States during 1968-1971 ranged from 0.17 to 0.67 \u00b5g/m3, whereas the concentrations at two rural sites ranged from 0.02 to 0.16 \u00b5g/m3 (Saltzman et al. 1985). The concentrations of zinc during 1977-1979 from the National Air Surveillance Networks were reported by Evans et al. (1984). The arithmetic mean zinc concentrations in urban areas in the United States ranged from 0.02 to 0.16 \u00b5g/m3, whereas the concentrations in nonurban areas ranged from 0.01 to 0.05 \u00b5g/m3. The geometric mean concentrations of zinc from three urban areas in New Jersey monitored in 1981-1982 ranged from 0.07 to 0.59 \u00b5g/m3, whereas the concentrations at a rural site ranged from 0.02 to 0.06 \u00b5g/m3 (Daisey 1987). Davidson et al. (1988) measured the atmospheric zinc concentrations at Great Smoky Mountains and Ol ympic National Parks where crustal weathering, sea spray, and long-range transport of zinc were likely to influence concentrations. The average atmospheric concentrations of zinc were 0.0033 and 0.0089 \u00b5g/m3 for Great Smoky Mountains in 1979 and Olympic National Parks in 1980, respectively. The reported c oncentration range of zinc in air at remote sites (arctic) was <0.003-0.027 \u00b5g/m3 (Barrie and Hoff 1985; al. 1974). In aerosol samples of the lower troposphere collected over the Southern Bight of the North Sea between September 1988 and October 1989, the average zinc concentration was 0.067 \u00b5g/m3 (standard deviation, 0.054 \u00b5g/m3; range, 0.003-0.22 \u00b5g/m3; n=108 samples) (Injuk et al. 1992). The concentration of atmospheric zinc is usually lower in winter than in summer (Barrie and Hoff 1985; Daisey 1987). Indoor air from other regions of the world has been reported to contain zinc in particulate matter at low levels. In 1991, household dust sampled from Bahr ain in Persian Gulf region contained zinc at a concentration of 64.4 \u00b5g/g (Akhter and Madany 1993). As part of the Southeastern Brazil Indoor Air ZINC 163 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Quality Study (SEBIAQS) in the summer of 1993, in door and outdoor air samples were collected at 12 sites in the cities of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Indoor air particulate samples had higher levels of zinc than outdoor samples. The concentration of zinc in indoor air particulates from S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil were 0.046-0.30 and 0.036-0.38 \u00b5g/m3, respectively, while outdoor samples ranged from not detected to 0.23 and from 0.05 to 0.29 \u00b5g/m3, respectively (Miguel et al. 1995). Although data are sparse, higher-than-background concentr ations have been reported near iron- and steel- producing factories and zinc, lead, and copper smelters. During zinc smelting operations, concentrated zinc ore goes through a roasting procedure to convert zinc sulfide to zinc oxide. This process accounts for a large portion of the total atmospheric zinc em ission during primary production (EPA 1980d). About 1.5 miles from a smelter in Kellogg, Idaho, Raga ini et al. (1977) detected high annual mean concentrations of zinc in ambient air of 5 \u00b5g/m3. The 24-hour values for zinc ranged from 0.27 to 15.7 \u00b5g/m3; the average lead and cadmium concentrations at this smelter site were 11 and 0.8 \u00b5g/m3, respectively, indicating severe environmental pollution. Higher concentrations of zinc in the vicinity of a copper smelter than in reference areas were also reported by Patterson et al. (1977). 6.4.2 Water In general, zinc is more concentrated in the sediments of streams and rivers than in the water column. It is reported by NAS (1977) that zinc is probably de tectable in 75% of all water samples from various locations. The zinc background con centrations in surface waters are usually <50 \u00b5g/L (EPA 1980d), but concentrations in surface waters and groundwater can range from 0.002 to 50 mg/L (NAS 1977). Table 6-4 summarizes the typical concentrations of di ssolved zinc in rivers of the United States (Shiller and Boyle 1985). The concentration of dissolved zi nc in water from three Adirondack lakes was highest for low pH waters (Heit et al. 1989). Lake water fro m Darts Lake (pH 5.1-5.4) contained 7.9 ng zinc/mL while Moss Lake, a lake with variable acidity (pH 5.8-6.7), contained zinc at 2.9 ng/mL and Rondoxe Lake, a neutral lake (pH 6.5-6.8) , contained 2.5 ng zinc/mL. In many locations (e.g., New England, the southeast , the Missouri River basin, the Rio Grande River basin, and the Upper Colorado River basin), higher-t han-background concentrations of zinc are common and appear to be correlated with mining activities in th ese areas and/or geological areas rich in zinc (EPA 1980d). However, in all river basins, there are some locations with zinc concentrations of 0.1-1.0 mg/L (EPA 1980d).

ZINC 166 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Willow Creek confluence, zinc concentrations were >20 \u00b5g/L and elevated concentrations occurred for the next 100 km (Taylor et al. 2001). The concen trations of zinc in water samples from Whitewood Creek, South Dakota, were measured by Hale (1977). The samples were collected upstream from the discharge of a local mining company. In 42 analyses, zinc concentrations ranged from <0.004 to 0.048 mg/L with a mean concentration of 0.018 mg/L. May et al. (2001) reported that water samples analyzed in 1996 from this contaminated watershed c ontained zinc at concentrations of 2.4-21 and 3.8- 30 \u00b5g/L for filtered and unfiltered samples, respectively. The average levels of dissolved zinc in water from Lakes Superior, Erie, and Ontario were 277, 87, and 160 ng/L, respectively, for samples collected between 1991 (Lake Superior) and 1993 (Lakes Ontario and Erie) (Nriagu et al. 1996). Coale and Flegal (1989) re ported that concentration of dissolved zinc in water from Lakes Erie and Ontario ranged from 3x10 -6 to 1.1x10-4 mg/L. In summer, there is a marked depletion of zinc in the epilimnion (i.e., area of wa rmest water) of Great Lakes off-shore waters, which may be attributed to biological processes (Nriagu et al. 1996). Groundwater from a shallow alluvial aquifer beneath a major urban center (Denver, Co lorado) contained dissolved zinc at a median concentration of 3 \u00b5g/L (range, 2-28 \u00b5g/L) (Bruce and McMahon 1996). Scudlark et al. (1994) reported that the average conc entration of zinc in water from the Chesapeake Bay was 1.21\u00b10.95 \u00b5g/L (n=5) for samples collected from 1990 to 1991. The median concentration of zinc in the Hudson River estuary decreased from 200 nM (1.6 ng/L) in 1974 to approximately 25 nM (13 ng/L) in 1997 (Sa\u00f1udo-Wilhelmy and Gill 1999). The declining le vels of zinc and other metals is a result of the decreased metal flux to the estuary from sewage effluents. Zinc concentrations in remote regions of the Atlantic Ocean ranged from 0.023 to 0.097 \u00b5g/L in the Northeast region and averaged 0.004 \u00b5g/L in the Northwest region (Helmers and Schrens 1995). Yeat s (1988) reported that the concentrations of dissolved zinc in ocean water from the Sargasso Sea and Northeast Pacific were 0.3-3.0 nM in 1984 and 3.6-9.2 nM (240-600 ng/L) in 1981, respectively. Seawater from lagoons of the Gulf of Mexico contained average dissolved zinc con centrations of 2.37, 5.12, and 9.76 \u00b5g/L for locations at Alvarado, San Andres, and Sedue (in Mexico), r espectively (Vazquez et al. 1995). The concentration of zinc in surficial seawater from the Indian River lagoon (Florida) ranged from 0.01 to 6.6 \u00b5g/L (average, 0.8\u00b11.4 \u00b5g/L) in 1992 (Trocine and Trefry 1996). Zinc concentration in precipitation from remote re gions of the Atlantic Ocean ranged from 0.359 to 3.93 \u00b5g/L (Helmers and Schrens 1995). Heaton et al . (1990) reported that precipitation collected from three locations Rhode Island between 1985 and 1988 contained zinc at median concentration of 4.5 ppb ZINC 167 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE (n=269). Levels of zinc were higher in samples coll ected in warm periods (5.8 ppb) versus cold periods (3.7 ppb). Nearly all zinc was dissolved in these sam ples. Trace amounts of zinc were measured in cloud water (n=3; range, <10-43 \u00b5g/L) collected from Wh iteface Mountain (Adirondacks Region, New York) in the summer of 1987 (Khwaja et al. 1995). Municipal waste incineration was the primary source of zinc in these wet deposition samples. Snow near an expres sway in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, contained zinc at average concentrations of 0.143, 0.33, 0.034, and 0.029 mg/L at 15, 20, 125, and 150 meters from the roadway, respectively (Loranger et al. 1996). Higher zinc concentrations near expressway were the result of road dust from tire abrasion. Available data suggest that zinc concentrations in dri nking water are far less than levels required to meet a daily intake level of 11 mg/day (assuming an a dult water consumption of 2 L/day) (IOM 2002). Concentrations of zinc in drinking water can be high er than levels in surface waters. Concentrations of 0.002-1.2 mg/L were detected in 77% of 1,577 surface water samples while levels of 0.003-2.0 mg/L were found in 380 drinking water samples (NAS 1977). Higher concentrations in drinking waters are a result of water treatment and of contamination fro m plumbing of the water distribution system. Zinc was found in drinking water at levels as great as several mg/L as a result of galvanized pipes and tanks in alkaline-water distribution systems. Dri nking water samples from galvanized pipe plumbing systems in Seattle, Washington, contained zinc con centrations of 0.128-1.279 mg/L; these levels were >10 times higher than those in homes with copper pipe plumbing systems (Sharrett et al. 1982a). Forty- three tap-water samples collected from homes in Dallas, Texas and analyzed for trace metals reported maximum, minimum, median, and average zinc con centrations of 0.049, 0.005, 0.011, and 0.0124 mg zinc/L, respectively (NAS 1977). High zinc concentra tions in these water samples were believed to be due to the household plumbing. In a study investig ating associations between inorganic constituents of drinking water and cardiovascular diseases, Greathou se and Osborne (1980) collected and analyzed tap water samples in 35 geographic areas in the United States; 100-110 tap-water samples were collected from each area. The maximum, minimum, and mean concentrations were 1.44 7, 0.025, and 0.144 mg zinc/L, respectively. Seventy-five percent of the zinc values were below 0.236 mg/L. Other investigators have attributed the higher concentrations of zinc in household tap waters, compared to finished drinking water, to distribution and transmission lines (Maessen et al. 1985; Ohanian 1986; Schock and Neff 1988). The median concentration of zinc in leachate from municipal landfills in the United States ranged from 0.68 to 1.7 mg/L with a high concentration of 250 mg/L (Roy 1994). ZINC 168 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 6.4.3 Sediment and Soil Zinc is found in soils and surficial materials of th e conterminous United States at concentrations between <5 and 2,900 mg/kg, with a mean of 60 mg/kg (Schacklette and Boerngen 1984) . Zinc concentrations measured across the United Stated ranged from <5 to 400 mg/kg and from <10 to 2,000 mg/kg, with corresponding means of 36 and 51 mg/kg in cultivated and uncultivated subsurface soils, respectively (Connor and Shacklette 1975); however, these differences in zinc concentration may be attributed to differences in the soils prior to use (and not to cultivation). The sampling survey was designed to determine zinc concentrations of surficial materials unaltered from their natural condition. Chen et al. (1999) determined the baseline concentration of zinc in 448 representative Florida surface soils as part of the Florida Cooperative Soil Survey Program. Ba seline soil samples represent natural elemental concentrations without human influence. The mean concentration of zinc was 8.35\u00b113.8 mg/kg (range, 0.9-169 mg/kg) in archived soil samples from this study. Soils near highways and smelters contained high zinc concentrations as a result of deposition of zinc released in tire abrasion and stack emissions (EPA 1980d; Norrstr\u00f6m and Jacks 1999). Urban alluvial soils from New Orleans, Louisiana had higher levels of zinc as a result of highway traffic (130 \u00b5g/g) than freshly deposited lower Mississippi River delta spillway alluvium (11.1 \u00b5g/g) (Mielke et al. 1999, 2000). A study was designed by Hutchinson and Wai (1979) to investigate the distribution of cadmium, lead, and zinc in the soil and vegetation at two reclaimed waste dumps from phosphate ore mines in southeastern Idaho. Zinc concentrations in the soil of the waste dumps averaged from 443\u00b1210 to 1,112\u00b1124 mg/kg. These values were high compared to those found in the control plot (54\u00b116 mg/kg). Zinc concentrations in vegetation from the reclai med waste dumps were also high compared to the control plot. Moderate-to\u00ad high levels of zinc contamination were found in leafy vegetables (lettuce) and their supporting soil in a zone with a 0-5-km radius around a copper smelter (Beavington 1975). The mean concentrations of zinc in 17 soil samples and 12 lettuce sa mples collected in this zone were 229\u00b117 and 316\u00b164 mg/kg dry weight, respectively. Significant relationships were found between the distance from the smelter and the levels of easily extractable zinc in the soil, and between the distance from the smelter and the content of zinc in herbage. The concentration of zinc in soil at the Palmerton zinc smelter site in eastern Pennsylvania was determined 6 years after zinc sme lting was terminated in 1980 (Storm et al. 1994). Levels in soils were highest (4,160 mg/kg) at s ites close to the former smelter and decreased with distance. Zinc concentrations in urban top soils from the western half of East St. Louis, Illinois (a city with historical industrial activities such as smelting of nonferrous metals) range d from 79 to 10,360 \u00b5g/g ZINC 169 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE with an average concentration of 1,034 \u00b5g/g (Kaminsk i and Landsberger 2000). Concentrations of zinc in soil irrigated with waste water or river water were measured by Schalscha et al. (1982). The total concentration of zinc in waste water-treated soils was 228 mg/kg. The total concentration of zinc in soils irrigated with river water ra nged from 103 to 136 mg/kg. Soils around galvanized water and electrical transmissi on towers have been reported to have elevated levels of zinc (Jones and Burgess 1984). Near Pe terborough, Ontario, Canada, soil nearest to a galvanized water tower contained zinc at a concen tration of 11,480\u00b12,966 \u00b5g/g dry weight, while the concentration of zinc in soil 50 meters from the tower was 54\u00b116 \u00b5g/g dry weight. Municipal sludge and municipal incineration ash cont ain considerably higher levels of zinc than uncontaminated soils (Mumma et al. 1984, 1990, 1991). Therefore, application of sludge and municipal ash to soil will elevate the levels of zinc in these soils. The mean concentrations (mg/kg) of zinc according to four land use types were as follows: agricultural, 25; suburban residential, 75; mixed industrial/residential, 157; and industrial inner urban area, 360 (Haines 1984). Zinc in water is transported to the sediment in the adsorbed or precipitated phase; the concentration of zinc in sediments of most waters is higher than the zinc concentration in aqueous phase. From 1992 to 1996, streambed sediments samples were collected from 541 locations at more than 50 river basins across the conterminous United States (illustrated in Ta ble 6-5) as part of the National Water-Quality Assessment Program (Rice 1999; USGS 2002). The median zinc concentration in these sediments was 110 \u00b5g/g dry weight (range, <4.0-9,000 \u00b5g/g dry wei ght). Samples collected from urban settings were enriched in zinc relative to agricu ltural or forest settings. The highest median concentration was observed in the Upper Colorado River Basin while the lowest was observed in Central Nebraska Basins (USGS 2002). Bed sediments from the South Platte River basin sampled from 1992 to 1993 contained zinc at concentrations ranging from 82 to 3,700 \u00b5g/g dry we ight (average, 454 \u00b5g/g dr y weight) (Heiny and Tat 1997). The highest concentrations were observed n ear the urban region around Denver, Colorado and in the Rocky Mountains. In 1979-1980, as part of the Apalachicola River Quality Assessment, fine grained sediment (<20 \u00b5m particle size) of the Apalachicola River was reported to contain zinc at a median concentration of 70 \u00b5g/g dry weight (n=15; range, 20-150 \u00b5g/g dry weight) (Elder and Mattraw 1984). Surficial lake sediments from four locations in Ro ck Mountain National Park contained zinc at mean concentrations ranging from 72\u00b14 to 125\u00b13 \u00b5g/g dry we ight (Heit et al. 1984). The geometric mean and range of zinc levels in lake sediment from 189 s ites in 52 Quebec and Ontario, Canada lakes were 125.2 and 3.0-559.9 \u00b5g/g dry weight, respectively (Row an and Kalff 1993).

POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE in sediments of the upper Columbia River, Britis h Columbia, ranged from 45 to 51 mg/kg, while zinc concentrations in sediments from Lake Rooseve lt, Washington were 60-26,840 mg/kg (Johnson et al. 1990). The higher zinc concentrations in lake sedimen ts were due to discharges from a lead-zinc smelter and a refinery. Contaminated sediments in the W est Branch of the Grand Calumet River (Indiana/ Illinois), a river system heavily impacted by various industrial activities for many years, were found to contain zinc at concentrations ranging from 325 to 9,281 ppm (mean, 1,270\u00b11,097 ppm) (Cahill and Unger 1993). Sediment samples collected from stre ams in the Black Hills, South Dakota, an area impacted by gold mining operations, contained zinc at levels ranging from 3.8 to 250 \u00b5g/g dry weight (May et al. 2001). Marine sediments also contain elevated concentrations of zinc with respect to concentrations of zinc in seawater. The concentration of zinc in Hamilton Ha rbor sediments ranged from 1,050 to 2,900 mg/kg, compared to zinc concentrations of 6-48 \u00b5g/L in the aqueous phase (Mayer and Manning 1990). Surficial sediments from the Newark Bay Estuary, Hackensack River, Newark Bay, Arthur Kill, and Kill van Kull contained zinc at mean concentrations of 739.5\u00b1243.9, 426\u00b1600.5, 489.8\u00b1238.1, 769.1\u00b1715.2, and 331.3\u00b1213.7 ppm, respectively (Crawford et al. 1995). Sediment samples collected from the Hudson River Estuary in 1991 contained zinc at levels of 27-215 and 400-2,500 mg/kg in bottom and suspended sediment, respectively (Gibbs 1994). Marine sedimen t samples from the border region of Baja California (Mexico) and California (United States) contained zinc at concentration levels ranging from 39 to 188 \u00b5g/g dry weight (mean, 68.3 \u00b5g/g dry weight) in the fine fraction (<63 \u00b5m) of sediment. A relative enrichment of >350% was observed with respect to nonpolluted sediments of the region (Villascusa- Celaya et al. 2000). Marine sediment in coastal areas of Mexico (Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico) was found to contain zinc at mean concentrations ranging from 4.0 to 227.0 \u00b5g/g dry weight (Villanueva and Botello 1998). Soto-Jimenez and P\u00e1ez-Osuna (2001) re ported mean concentrations of zinc ranging from 84.3\u00b138.7 to 359\u00b176.5 mg/kg dry weight for marine sediments collected in November 1994 from Mazatl\u00e1n Harbor, Mexico (southeastern Gulf of California). This harbor receives land runoff and untreated or partially treated industrial, shipping, and domestic effluents from local point sources. During the period of 1984-1985, marine sediment samples were collected from the San Andres lagoon of the Gulf of Mexico, which is located near two industrial ports and industrial effluent is discharged into the lagoon year round. Sediments from this region were found to contain zinc at a concentration of 10.1 mg/kg dry weight (Vasquez et al. 1994). ZINC 173 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 6.4.4 Other Environmental Media As part of the National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program, the concentration of zinc in various species of fish was measured (USGS 2000a, 2000b, 2001). The concen tration of zinc in fish fillet sampled from the Lower Tennessee River Basin ranged from 3.0 to 46.0 \u00b5g/g dry weight for 79 of 102 positive detections from 1980 to 1998 (USGS 2001). Fish fillets collected from the Clark Fork-Pend Oreille and Spokane River Basins (W ashington, Idaho, and Montana) contained zinc at concentrations ranging from 11 to 36 \u00b5g/g dry weight (n=15; median 16 \u00b5g/g dry weight) in 1998 (USGS 2000b). In the National Contaminant Biomonitoring Program, the geom etric mean concentration of zinc in various whole fish was 21.7 mg/kg wet weight (Schmitt and Br umbaugh 1990). Of all fish tested (e.g., bloater, sucker, white perch, bass, catfish, etc.), common carp showed the highest level of zinc. No significant trend in the level of zinc in whole fish was ob served during 1978-1984. Blevens and Pancorbo (1986) determined the zinc concentrations in muscle tissue of fish from aquatic systems in east Tennessee, from 1980 to 1984. Mean levels of zinc in fish from Nolichucky and Little Chucky Creeks ranged from 12 to 19 ppm wet weight. Fish from Wata uga and Boone Lakes had a range of mean zinc concentrations of 8.3-12 ppm wet weight; in the Holston River Basin, th e range of mean concentrations of zinc was 4.6- 28 ppm wet weight. The mean concentrati on of zinc in muscle tissue of tuna ( Thunnus thynnus ) collected from the northwest Atlantic Ocean was 17 \u00b5g/g dr y weight (range, 12-25 \u00b5g/g dry weight) in 1990 (Hellou et al. 1992). Zinc will not concentrate in fish tissues with exposure to elevated concentrations. The concentration of zinc in yellow perch ( Perca flavescens) from six acidic lakes in northwestern New Jersey ranged from 26.1 to 66.2 mg/kg dry weight (Sprenger et al. 1988). Although the concentrations of mercury and lead in fish from acidic lakes were higher compared to fish collected from nonacidic lakes, the concentrations of zinc showed no significant difference. Similarly, high concentrations of zinc were not found in white suckers ( Catostomus commersoni) and in New York (Heit and Klusek 1985). Fish from the Milltown Reservoir Superfund Site in Montana (characterized by elevated concentrations of metals in wetland soils, surface water, and groundwater) contained zinc in whole body tissues at a concentration of 26.3 mg/kg wet weight (Pascoe collected from storm wa ter ponds and natural lakes and ponds in Orlando, Florida between 1991 and 1992 (Campbe ll 1994). The mean concentrations of zinc in whole fish collected from storm water ponds were 42. 2, 29.99, and 36.1 mg/kg wet weight for redear sunfish, largemouth bass, and bluegill sunfish, respectively. At natural lakes and ponds (controls sites), ZINC 174 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE the mean concentrations of zinc were 24.83, 21.18 , and 30.72 other sessile estuarine organisms are ofte n used as a measure of contamination of estuarine water because they usually contain hi gher levels of metals than fish. The arithmetic mean concentration of zinc in oysters (Crassostrea virginica ) from the Mississippi Sound collected in 1988 was 640 mg/kg wet weight (Lytle and Lytle 1990). Oysters collected from the San Andres lagoon (Gulf of Mexico) from 1984 to 1985 contained zinc at a concentration of 3,180 mg/kg dry weight (Vazquez et al. 1994). The mean concentration of zinc in oysters (C. virginica ) collected from the U.S. coastline of the Gulf of Mexico during 1986-1988 was 2,150 mg /kg dry weight (Presley et al. 1990). In a nationwide mussel watch program, the mean concentrations of zinc in molluscs ( Mytilus edulis ) around the coast of the United States during 1976-1988 ranged from 67 to 3,700 mg/kg dry weight (Lauenstein et al. 1990). Although the concentration on a nationwide basis varied depending on sampling sites, the level of zinc showed little evidence of statistically signifi cant change during 1976-19 88. Clams endevors (Corbicula manilmsis ) collected as part of the Apalachicola River Quality Assessment between 1979 and 1980 contained zinc at a median concentration of 20 \u00b5g/g dry weight (range, 2.1-26 \u00b5g/g dry weight) (Elder and Mattraw 1984). Blue crabs ( Callinectes sapidus ) from the Quinnipac and Connecticut Rivers (Connecticut), which are mostly harvested for pers onal consumption, contained zinc in muscle and heltopancreas tissues at concentrations of 31-33 a nd 27-28 mg/kg wet weight, respectively (Jop et al. 1997). Vegetation may accumulate higher levels zinc if grow n on contaminated soils. Jones et al. (1988) found that corn plants and young corn plants ( Zea mays) grown beneath and close to a galvanized electrical transmission tower had elevated concentrations of zinc due to corrosion of the zinc protective layer on the steel. Corn seedlings grown in a highly contaminated soil (1,425 \u00b5g zinc/g soil) a meter from the tower had zinc concentration in shoots and roots of 484\u00b1103 and 1,330\u00b1250 \u00b5g/g dry weight, respectively. In contrast, seedlings grown in soil 50 meters from tower (67.3 \u00b5g zinc/g soil) had zinc concentrations in shoots and roots of 25.3\u00b14.2 and 21.0\u00b12.6 \u00b5g/g dry weight, respectively. Bache et al. (1991) found concentrations of zinc were highest in grass samples (Phleum to the a municipal waste incinerator (135.7 \u00b5g/g dry weight) compared to grass samples collected upwind or a distance from the incinerator (17.82-73.78 \u00b5g/g dry weight). Grasses collected from the Milltown Reservoir Superfund Site in Montana contained zinc at concentrations of 153.7 and 882.1 mg/kg for above- and below-ground samples, respectively (Pascoe et al. 1996). In cont rast, control samples from a reference area contained ZINC 175 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE zinc at concentrations of 71.8 and 36.2 mg/kg for above- and below-ground samples, respectively. Other studies have not shown significant correlations betw een zinc concentrations in soils and vegetation (Fytianos et al. 2001; Schuhmacher et al. 1998). Sewage sludge and compost, which may be used in ag riculture as a soil amendment, have high levels of zinc. The average concentrations of zinc in m unicipal solid waste compost and sewage from the United States were found to be 609 and 1,202 mg/kg dry we ight, respectively (He et al. 1995). The median concentration of zinc found in residential compos t from Toronto, Canada was 190 mg/kg dry weight (range, 100-410 mg/kg dry weight) (E vans and Tan 1998). Biowaste, composed of organic waste products from indoors and outdoors, contained zinc at concentrations of 120\u00b125, 129\u00b113, and 338\u00b158 mg/kg dry matter in the >5 mm, 1-5 mm, and <0.05 mm fractions, respectively (Veeken and Hamelers 2002). Other environmental concentrations of significance include coal and paint. Coal from the United States was found to contain zinc at a mean concentration of 53\u00b1440 ppm (n=7,908; maximum=19,000 ppm) (Finkelman 1999). Zinc of 31,101 \u00b5g/g (n=31; range, 52- 98,056 \u00b5g/g) in paint from historic old homes of New Orleans, Louisiana (Mielke et al. 2001). 6.5 GENERAL POPULATION AND OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE General Population. Zinc is essential element needed by the body in small amounts and ranks as one of the most abundant trace metals in humans. Sources of exposure to zinc include ingestion of food, drinking water, food, polluted air, tobacco products , and occupational exposure, with ingestion of food being the primary route of exposure. NAS established the RDA for zinc at 11 mg/day for men and 8 mg/day for women (IOM 2002). The average daily intake (AVDI) of zinc in humans is on the order of 5.2-16.2 mg zinc/day (Pennington et al. 1986). The dietary intake of an average t eenage male has been estimated to be 0.27 mg zinc/(kg/day). Dietary supplements may provide up to an additional 1 mg zinc/(kg/day) (EPA 1980d). In an extensive survey of foods in the total diets of individuals in the United States, conducted by FDA during 1982-1984, the following values for daily zinc intakes (mg/day) were estimated in eight age and sex men, 12.64 (Penningt on et al. 1986). FDA included drinking water in ZINC 176 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE the total diet. In 1986, the average daily intakes of 40 African-Americans (age 21-65 years old living in Washington D.C. area) were 7.7\u00b10.4 mg for men and 9.1\u00b10.7 mg for women (Ellis et al. 1997). These results are comparable with data from the USDA's Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) and the National Health and Nutrition Ex amination Survey (NHANES) III, which reported average daily intakes as follows: NHANES III, 40-49 year old value, male (12.3 mg/day), female (8.5 mg/day); CSFII, >20-year-old value, male (12.9 mg/day), female, (8.3 mg/day). The estimated average daily intakes of zinc were reported to be 14, 11, 14, and 13.2 mg/day in France, Spain, Sweden, and Belgium, respectively (Biego et al. 1998). Using a market basket method, the average daily intakes of zinc for residents of Japan were estimated as 8,700 and 8,500 \u00b5g/day for the years 1991 and 1992, respectively (Tsuda et al. 1995). After a review of the literature, the National Research Council concluded that zinc concentrations in drinking water are generally well below 5 mg/L (NAS 1977). Assuming a daily intake of 2 L of water and an average body weight of 70 kg, a daily intake of <0.14 mg zinc/kg/day from drinking water can be estimated. Based on a body weight of 70 kg, the m ean daily intakes of zinc in drinking water for residents of homes with galvanized and copper pipe plumbing systems in Seattle, Washington, were estimated to be 0.017-0.028 and 0.002-0.006 mg /kg/day, respectively (Sharrett et al. 1982b). Food is the major source of zinc for the general population (EPA 1987c). Zinc is widespread in commonly consumed foods but tends to be higher in those of animal origin, particularly some seafoods (e.g., one serving of oysters will more than meet the daily dietary requirements of zinc) (NAS/NRC 1979). Meat products contain relatively high concentr ations of zinc, whereas fruits and vegetables have relatively low concentrations. Meats, fish, and poultry contained an average of 24.5 mg zinc/kg, whereas grains (or cereal products) and potatoes contained 8 a nd 6 mg/kg, respectively (Mahaffey et al. 1975). Zinc was present in all of the examined food classes. A diet of dairy products, meat, fish, poultry, grains, and cereals provides approximately 77% of the daily zi nc intake. Data reported by the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agricult ure indicate that zinc was detected in 99.4-100% of the samples of healthy livestock and poultry ra ndomly selected from among the specimens presented for slaughter in 1985-1986. Zinc concentrations in muscle tissue ranged from 0.20 ppm in young turkeys (n=61) to 1.92 ppm in heifers/steers (n=287) (Colem an et al. 1992). In a review of zinc levels in vegetables and other foods and beverages of plant origin, Weigert (1991) reported the following average concentrations (mg/kg): wheat, 41; rye, 13; rice, 8- 20; 1.66; mushrooms, 9.7; cocoa, 35; tea, 35; and coffee, 6.7. Zinc is found in onions, peas, and potatoes from Denmark at mean concentrations of 3.4, 3.3-5.5, a nd 7.9 mg/kg fresh weight, respectively (Bibak et al. ZINC 177 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 1998a, 1998b; 1999). Zinc has also been detected in wines from Seville, Spain, at concentrations of 0.3- 5.40 \u00b5g/mL, while concentrations of zinc in sherry wines ranged from 0.12 to 5.08 mg/L (L\u00f3pez-Artiguez et al. 1990, 1996). As part of the U.S. FDA's Total Diet Study (TDS), market basket food items from locations in United States were sampled from 1991 through 1999 (FDA 2000). Results from this survey showed the highest amounts of zinc in cereals ranging from a mean of 147 mg/kg for fruit-sweetened cereals to 8.2 mg/kg for corn flakes. Beef and othe r meat products also included a large amount of zinc, with the highest meat product mean being 81 mg/kg fo r baked beef chuck roast. In France, the estimated dietary intake of zinc from different foods were de termined as follows (\u00b5g/day): vegetables, total, 14,429 (Biego et al. 1998). The largest percentage of zinc is from meat-poultry-eggs (58%) followed by cereals (18%) and milk-dairy products (8%). Federal regulations permit the use of zinc acetate, zinc oxide, and zinc sulfide as components of adhesives, coatings, or rubber packaging material s intended for food contact (FDA 1987b, 1987c, 1987d). Federal regulations also permit the use of zinc chlo ride, zinc oxide, zinc stearate, and zinc sulfate as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) food additiv es when they are used \"in accordance with good practices\" (FDA 1987e, 1987f, 1987g, 1987h, 19 87i, 1987j). In addition, the use of zinc oxide as a color additive in drugs and cosmetics is also permitted with certain restrictions (FDA 1987a). Negligible quantities of zinc are inhaled in ambient air. Exposure to airborne zinc is largely occupational through the inhalation of industrial dusts or fumes. Individuals occupationally exposed to metallic zinc and zinc compounds are those involve d in galvanizing, smelting, welding, or brass foundry operations. In such operations, zinc as ore or metal and its alloys are often exposed in an oxidizing atmosphere to temperatures near the metal's boiling point of 907 \u00b0C. This heating results in the formation of fresh zinc oxide particles (0.2-1.0 \u00b5m), which ma y subsequently be inhaled. Inha lation of zinc oxide particles and fumes by workers can result in metal fume fever (Mar tin et al. 1999). Inhalation was reported to be the most probable route of exposure to zinc for 26 lead smelter workers found to have significantly (p<0.01) elevated blood plasma levels of zinc. Mean plasma zinc concentrations were 12.9 mmol/L (range, 9.8- 16.7) for the workers versus 10.9 mmol/L (range, 8.1-14.6) for a nonlead-exposed control group (Vasikaran et al. 1992). Twenty workers in a zinc foundry in Baiyin, China were investigated for exposure to zinc oxide fumes (Martin et al. 1999). Eighteen of the workers had worked at the foundry since its opening 6 years earlier. Thirteen of the subj ects reported at least one of the symptoms associated with metal fume fever during their tenure at the foundry. Workers were examined before the start of the ZINC 178 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE shift, in the middle of the shift, and after the shift. Despite zinc exposures as high as 36.3 mg/m3 over <4 hours and a mean air sample concentration of 3.16 mg/m3, no cases of metal fume fever were observed for these workers. Concentrations of zinc in serum and urine for these workers and 3.6705 the period of an 8-hour shift. Zinc is found in human tissues and body fluids. As part of the 1982 National Human Adipose Tissue Survey (NHATS) conducted in the United States, the c oncentration of zinc in adipose tissue ranged from 1.1 to 6.0 \u00b5g/g (EPA 1986). The mean concentration of zinc was 6.95\u00b11.08 \u00b5g/mL in whole blood samples from residents of Baajoz, Spain (a region with low environmental pollution) with zinc levels increasing with age (Moreno et al. 1999). Individua ls <30, 30-45, and >45 y ears old had whole blood zinc concentrations of 4.85, 6.85, and 7.32 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. Blood and serum collected from 372 adolescents (15 years old) from the Swedish cities of Uppsala and Trollh\u00e4ttan contained zinc at median concentrations of 6.1 and 0.99 mg/L, respectively (B\u00e1r\u00e1ny et al . 2002). The mean concentration of zinc in the fingernails and toenails of populations from the United States, Canada, and Japan were 105, 109, and 94 mg/kg, respectively (Takagi et al. 1988). Hayashi et al. (1993) reported that human fingernail samples from Japanese individuals had higher mean levels of zinc in the spring (145-149 \u00b5g/g) compared to winter (122-136 \u00b5g/g). The geometric mean concen trations of zinc in toenails (129 mg/kg) and scalp hair (108 mg/kg) of pre-school children in Germany were about the same (Wilhelm et al. 1991). The total concentrations of zinc in 29 body tissues of 55 human cadavers were measured (Saltzman et al. 1990). The lowest concentration (mean of 1.5\u00b12.2 mg/kg we t weight) of zinc in both males and females was found in adipose tissues, while the highest concentrations were detected in the skull of males (mean of 54.3 mg/kg wet weight) and in the skeletal muscle of females (mean of 59.0 mg/kg wet weight). The mean concentrations of zinc in the feces of low-in come urban Hispanics and rural Blacks in the United States were 75 and 94 mg/kg wet weight, respectiv ely (Prevost et al. 1985). Body tissue and fluid samples were collected from two nonoccupationally exposed individuals living in the Los Angeles, California area (Krishnan and Que Hee 1992). Ea r wax, blood plasma, sweat, and skin from these individuals contained zinc at le vels of 88-103, 0.79-1.7, 0.50-1.58, and 15.6-1,000 \u00b5g/g dry weight, respectively. Concentrations of zinc in human milk are affected by the stages lactation. Arnaud and Favier (1995) found that the level of zinc in human milk will ri se to a peak 2-days postpartum (183\u00b170 \u00b5mol/L or 12.0\u00b14 mg/L) and then 6-days postpartum, 77\u00b122 \u00b5mol/L or 5.0\u00b11.4 mg/L). At 6-months, th e concentration of zinc in human m ilk is only 12% of its initial levels (D\u00f3rea 2002). Wasowicz et al. (2001) observed an inve rse relationship between zinc levels in blood ZINC 179 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE plasma and human milk for lactating women from Poland. Mean levels of zinc in blood plasma increased from 0.51\u00b10.13 mg/L (0-4 days postpartum) to 0.76\u00b10.20 mg/L (10-30 days postpartum), while mean levels of zinc in human milk decreased from 8.2\u00b1 2.8 mg/L (0-4 days postpartum) to 1.4\u00b10.7 mg/L (10-30 days postpartum). Zinc levels in maternal blood are normally higher than levels in cord blood. Maternal and cord blood of 56 mothers living in Singapore were analyzed for zi nc (Ong et al. 1993). For these mothers, the mean concentrations of zinc were 4.97\u00b11.15 and 1.58\u00b10.45 mg/L in maternal and cord blood, respectively. During the period of 1993-1997, Raghunath et al. (20 00) determined the concentration of zinc in maternal and cord blood for 148 mothers (20-25 years old) living Mumbai City, India. The mean concentrations of zinc were 6.335 and 2.527 mg/L in maternal and cord blood, respectively. Occupational. As part of the National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES) conducted from 1980 to 1983, NIOSH statistically estimated that 269 workers (including 22 women) in 22 plants were potentially exposed to elemental zinc in the workplace; also, 133,608 workers (including 17,586 women) in 6,157 plants were potentially exposed to other forms of zinc (of undefined composition) in the workplace (NIOSH 1984b). All of the workers exposed to elemen tal zinc were employed in the fabricated metal products industry as millwrights or assemblers. The la rgest numbers of workers exposed to other forms of zinc worked in the primary metal industries, w ith fabricated metal products, with transportation equipment, with stone, clay, and glass products, and in special trade contractors industries. Occupational groups with the largest numbers of exposed work ers were miscellaneous machine operators (not elsewhere classified or not specified), molding and casting machine operators, janitors and cleaners, and machinists. Exposure estimates we re derived from observations of the actual use of the compound and the use of trade name products known to contain the compound. 6.6 EXPOSURES OF CHILDREN This section focuses on exposures from conception to matu rity at 18 years in humans. Differences from adults in susceptibility to hazardous substances are di scussed in Section 3.7, Children's Susceptibility. Children are not small adults. A child's exposure may differ from an adult's exposure in many ways. Children drink more fluids, eat more food, breathe more air per kilogram of body weight, and have a larger skin surface in proportion to their body volume. A child's diet often differs from that of adults. The developing human's source of nutrition changes with age: from placental nourishment to breast milk ZINC 180 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE or formula to the diet of older children who eat more of certain types of foods than adults. A child's behavior and lifestyle also influence exposure. Child ren crawl on the floor, put things in their mouths, sometimes eat inappropriate things (such as dirt or paint chips), and spend more time outdoors. Children also are closer to the ground, and they do not u se the judgment of adults to avoid hazards (NRC 1993). As for adults, sources of exposure for children to zinc include ingestion of f ood, drinking water, and polluted air, with ingestion of food being the primary r oute of exposure. In an extensive survey of foods in the total diets of children in the United States, conducted by FDA during 1982-1984, the following values for daily zinc intakes boys, 15.61 (Pennington et al. 1986). The FDA also included drinking water in the total diet. Hair sa mples collected from children (10-12 years old) living rural and industrial areas of southern Poland and anal yzed for zinc (Zachwieja et al. 1995). Hair samples of children from Krak\u00f3w-Shakina (urban areas), Tarn\u00f3w-Czechowice-Dziedzice (industrial areas), and rural areas contained zinc at concentrations of 171.5, 185.0, and 244.6 ppm, respectively (Zachwieja et al. 1995). Whole blood samples from children (3-6 years old) living in Mumbai and Hyderabad, industrialized urban areas of India, contained zinc at mean concentrations of 398.9 and 483.4 \u00b5g/dL, respectively (Tripathi et al. 2001). At waste sites, zinc that is found in excess of natura l background levels is most likely to be in soil, and presents a special hazard for young children. Hand-to -mouth activity and eating contaminated dirt will result in oral exposure to zinc. The hazard in this case depends on the form of zinc that is present at the waste site. Zinc in soil at waste sites is in both solu ble and insoluble forms; zinc in insoluble forms would be expected to be less availabl e than more soluble forms. Zinc exposure to children from parents' work clot hes, skin, hair, tools, or other objects from the workplace is possible if the parent uses zinc or its compounds at work. Househol d products or products used in crafts, hobbies, or cottage industries which contain galvanized materials (e.g., nails) or zinc- containing paint will have significant amounts of zinc. Hand-to-mouth activity, chewing, and eating these materials may result in higher exposure to zinc. However, no cases of home exposure to zinc were located in the literature. ZINC 181 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE 6.7 POPULATIONS WITH POTENTIALLY HIGH EXPOSURES Certain populations receive greater-than-average expos ures to zinc from environmental sources. For example, higher levels of zinc have been reported in soil and water near waste sites, metal smelters, and areas exposed to untreated waste water (Hutchinson a nd Wai 1979; Ragaini et al. 1977; Schalscha et al. 1982). Other populations at risk of high exposure are those that have galvanized plumbing in their residences, and those that intentionally consume la rge doses of zinc as a dietary supplement. Patients who receive chronic treatment with drugs containing zi nc salts (such as injectable insulin) are exposed to higher zinc levels than the general popul ation. Allergic reactions to the zinc in insulin have been reported (Bruni et al. 1986). People in certain occupations (e.g., nonferrous metal smelting) are likely to be exposed to higher concentrations of zinc than th e general population (see Section 6.5). However, the higher exposure may not be indicative of a long-term increase in body burden. Fo r example, the median zinc concentration in the lung tissues of 21 Swedis h workers previously employed in the refining and smelting of nonferrous metals was about the same as in a control group (11.0 versus 10.7 mg/kg wet weight) (Hewitt 1988). On the other hand, the median concentration of zinc in lung tissues of eight deceased coal miners from England was 72 mg/kg wet weight compared to a median value of 54 mg/kg wet weight for a control group (Hewitt 1988); however, the study author did not provide any evidence that the difference in zinc concentrations in the lungs of unexposed controls is statistically significant. Individuals who smoke or who use zinc supplementati on will have greater exposure to zinc. Zinc was measured in samples of cigarette tobacco from the United States at concentrations ranging from 30 to 69 \u00b5g/g (Jenkins 1986). Levels of zinc in smoke from these cigarettes ranged from 0.34 to 1.21 \u00b5g/cigarette. Individuals, who use high-dose zinc supplementation as a potential treatment for age-related macular degeneration, will have higher exposures to zinc. Hiller et al. (1995) reported that zinc supplements will have an effect on the c oncentration of serum zinc in the body. 6.8 ADEQUACY OF THE DATABASE Section 104(i)(5) of CERCLA, as amended, directs the Administrator of ATSDR (in consultation with the Administrator of EPA and agencies and programs of the Public Health Service) to assess whether adequate information on the health effects of zinc is available. Where adequate information is not available, ATSDR, in conjunction w ith NTP, is required to assure the initiation of a program of research designed to determine the health effects (and techniques for developing methods to determine such health effects) of zinc. ZINC 182 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE The following categories of possible data needs have been identified by a joint team of scientists from ATSDR, NTP, and EPA. They are defined as substance-specific informational needs that if met would reduce the uncertainties of human health assessment. This definition should not be interpreted to mean that all data needs discussed in this section must be filled. In the future, the identified data needs will be evaluated and prioritized, and a substance-sp ecific research agenda will be proposed. 6.8.1 Identification of Data Needs Physical and Chemical Properties. Data are available that adequately characterize the physical and chemical properties of the various forms of zinc to permit estimation of their environmental fate (ACGIH 1991; Baes and Sharp Production, Import/Export, Use, Release, and Disposal. According to the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. Section 11023, industries are required to submit substance release and off-site transfer info rmation to the EPA. The TRI, which contains this information for 2002, became available in May of 2004. This database is updated yearly and should provide a list of industrial production facilities and emissions. Information about current and future production of zinc and zinc compounds is available. Zinc is also one of the most widely used metals in the world (Mire nda 1986). In 2001, approxima tely 799,000 metric tons of zinc were produced in the United States from do mestic ores. The estimated world production from mines in 2001 was 8,850,000 metric tons (USGS 2001). Information on the use of zinc and its compounds in the home, environment, and workplace is available. Zinc is most commonly used as a protective coating for other metals. It is also used in alloys such as bronze and brass, for electrical apparatus, and in organic chemical extractions. Zinc salts have numerous applications, including wood preservation. Zinc chloride is a primary ingredient in smoke bombs. In pharmaceuticals, zinc salts are used as solubilizing agents in drugs, including insulin (Lloyd 1984; Lloyd and Showak 1984; Windholz 1983). Zinc oxide is found in ointments used to treat burns and infectious and skin diseases (EPA 1987d). Zinc is also utilized therapeutically in hu man medicine in the treatment of zinc deficiency (Elinder 1986). Information on typical releases of zi nc and its compounds in th e home, environment, and workplace, and which environmental media are likely to be contaminated with significant quantities of zinc are available. Zinc is ubiquitous in the environment. Both natural releases and releases of human ZINC 183 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE origin to the environment can be significant (EPA 2004). Soils and sediments are likely to contain significant quantities of zinc and its compounds (Connor and Shacklette 1975; Rice 1999; Shacklette and Boerngen 1984; USGS 2002). Current disposal methods are efficient (Dawson and Mercer 1986; Lloyd and Showak 1984). No data were located regarding the am ount of zinc being disposed. Rules and regulations regarding the disposal of zinc are available (Daw son and Mercer 1986; DOI 1991). According to the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. Section 11023, industries are required to submit chemical release and off-site transfer information to EPA. The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) contains this information for 2001. Environmental releases of zinc and zinc compounds from manufacturing and processing facilities required to report their releases are listed in Tables 6-1 and 6-2. This database is updated yearly and should provide a list of industrial production facilities and emissions. Environmental Fate. Zinc partitions to the air, wate r, and soil (EPA 1979d; Guy and Chakrabarti 1976; Houba et al. 1983; Pita and Hyne 1975). Zinc occurs in the environment mainly in the +2 oxidation state (Lindsey 1979). Adsorption is the dominant fate of zinc, resulting in enrichment of zinc in suspended and bed sediments (EPA 1979d). The mobilit y of zinc in soil has been characterized (Baes and Sharp 1983; Bergkvist et Kalbasi et al. 1978; Saeed and Fox 1977; Tyler and McBride 1982). No estimate for the atmospheric lifetime of zinc is available. Development of pertinent data on the atmospheric processes important for zinc speciation in the atmosphere would be helpful. Development of this information would permit construction of a comprehensive model for the transport and interaction of zinc not only in air but in other media as well. Transformation in air and water can occur as a result of changes in chemical speciation (Anderson et al. 1988; EPA 1979d, 1980d; Stokinger 19 81). Data that describe the transformation processes for zinc in soil or the fate of zinc in soil are needed. A m odel of zinc flux from all environmental compartments would be useful for providing information on the overall environmental fate of zinc. The primary anthropogenic sources of zinc in the envir onment (i.e., air, water, soil) are related to mining and metallurgic operations involving zinc and use of commercial products containing zinc (EPA 1980d; NAS 1977; Nriagu and Pacyna 1988; Ragaini et al. 1977; TRI02 2004). Zinc has been detected in air, surface water, groundwater, and soil, with the frequency of detection and the concentrations greatest near source areas (e.g., hazardous waste sites and industrial areas such as lead smelters) (EPA 1980d; HazDat Mumma et al. 1984, 1990, 1991; NAS 1977). ZINC 184 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Bioavailability from Environmental Media. Zinc can be absorbed following inhalation (Drinker and Drinker 1928; Hamdi 1969), ingestion (Aamodt et al. 1983; Davies al. 1988; Methfessel and Spencer 1973; NAS/NRC Spencer et al. 1990; Gordon et al. 1981; Hallmans 1977; Keen and Hurley 1977). No estimates of the bioavailability of zinc after inhalation of zinc particles in air, ingestion fro m water and soil, or skin contact with bath water or soil were located. The bioavailability of zinc is hi gher in media with a low pH, as a result of increased zinc solubility and ionization. If zinc is partly present in an irreversibly ad sorbed state in soil, this part is not available for skin absorption. It would be usef ul to develop quantitative data on the bioavailability of zinc from various environmental media. Food Chain Bioaccumulation. Zinc bioconcentrates moderately in aquatic organisms, and this bioconcentration is higher in crustaceans and bivalve species than in fish (EPA 1987c; Ramelow et al. 1989). Zinc may concentrate in plants grown on contaminated soils. However, it does not biomagnify through the terrestrial food chain (Biddinger a nd Gloss 1984; EPA 1979d; Hegstrom and West 1989; Levine et al. 1989). Exposure Levels in Environmental Media. Reliable monitoring data for the levels of zinc in contaminated media at hazardous waste sites are needed so that the information obtained on levels of zinc in the environment can be used in combination w ith the known body burden of zinc to assess the potential risk of adverse health effects in populations living in the vicinity of hazardous waste sites. Zinc has been detected in air (Barrie and Hoff 1985; Duce et al. 1975; EPA et 1984; John et al. 1973; Lioy et al. 1978; Lloyd and S howak 1984; Patterson et al. 1977; Pratt et al. et al. al. 1985; Spicer et al. 1996; Zoller et al. 1974), water (Bruce and McMahon 1996; Coale and Flegal 1989; Boyle 1985; al. 2001; Windom 1991), 1975; Manning 1990; Mielke et al. 1999, 2000; Mumma et al. 1984, 1991; Norrstr\u00f6m and Jacks 1999; Schalscha et al. 1982; Storm et al. 1994), and food (Coleman et al. 1992; FDA 2001; Gartrell et al. 1986a; Mahaffey et al. 1975; Weigert 1991). However, since most of the data are not current, i.e., within the last 3 years, additional data would be useful to provide a more complete character ization of human exposure and the trend in zinc concentrations in various environmental media. Estimates have been made for human intake of zinc from ZINC 185 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE food and drinking water (EPA 1980d; Gartrell et al. 1986a; IOM Sharrett et are needed on estim ated daily intakes from inhalation resulting from occupational exposures. Reliable monitoring data for the levels of zinc in co ntaminated media at hazardous waste sites are needed so that the information obtained on levels of zinc in the environment can be used in combination with the known body burden of zinc to assess the potential risk of adverse health effects in populations living in the vicinity of hazardous waste sites. Exposure Levels in Humans. Zinc has been detected in finger nails, toenails, hair, all tissues, organs, skull and skeletal muscle, blood, feces, urine, sweat, and saliva (Greger and Sickles 1979; Hambidge et al. et al. 1990; Schroeder et al. 1967; Takagi et al. 1988; Wastney et al. 1986; Wilhelm et al. 1991). Most of the data on occupa tional exposure levels of zinc are outdated (NIOSH 1976, 1984b). Additional information on potentially exposed workers a nd exposure levels would provide a more accurate characterization of occupational ex posures in the United States. Current biological monitoring data on zinc are needed for populations surrounding hazardous waste sites. This information is necessary for assessing th e need to conduct health studies on these populations. This information is necessary for assessing the need to conduct health studies on these populations. Exposures of Children. Limited data are available rega rding the exposure and body burdens of children to zinc. Children, like adults, are primarily e xposed to zinc through the diet. Zinc was identified in the postpartum human milk of women at concentra tions of 5 to 12 mg/L (Arnaud and Favier 1995). In an extensive survey of foods in the total diets of individuals in the United States, conducted by FDA during 1982-1984, the following values for daily zinc intakes (mg/day) were estimated for children: 6- 14-16-year-old boys, 15.61 (Pennington et al. 1986). Since zinc is found in soil and children ingest soil either intentionally through pica or unintentionally thro ugh hand-to-mouth activity, pica is a unique exposure pathway for children. While zinc is found in home products such as paint, ointments, galvanized metals, coins, and dietary supplements, this exposure rout e should be low and will not disproportionally affect children. Continued monitoring data are necessar y to understand potentiall y dangerous routes of childhood exposure. ZINC 186 6. POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN EXPOSURE Child health data needs relating to susceptibility are discussed in Secti on 3.12.2, Identification of Data Needs: Children's Susceptibility. Exposure Registries. No exposure registries for zinc were loca ted. This substance is not currently one of the compounds for which a sub-registry has been established in the National Exposure Registry. The substance will be considered in the future when chemical selection is made for sub-registries to be established. The information that is amassed in the National Exposure Registry facilitates the epidemiological research needed to assess adverse health outcomes that ma y be related to exposure to this substance. 6.8.2 Ongoing Studies The Federal Research in Progress (FEDRIP 2004) da tabase provides additional information obtainable from a few ongoing studies that may fill in some of the data needs identified in Section 6.8.1.

ANALYTICAL METHODS The purpose of this chapter is to describe the analytical methods that are available for detecting, measuring, and/or monitoring zinc, its metabolites, and other biomarkers of exposure and effect to zinc. The intent is not to provide an exhaustive list of anal ytical methods. Rather, the intention is to identify well-established methods that are used as the standard methods of analysis. Many of the analytical methods used for environmental samples are the meth ods approved by federal agencies and organizations such as EPA and the National Institute for Occupati onal Safety and Health (N IOSH). Other methods presented in this chapter are those that are approve d by groups such as the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) and the American Publ ic Health Association (APHA). Additionally, analytical methods are included that modify previously used methods to obtain lower detection limits and/or to improve accuracy and precision. Zinc is ubiquitous in both the environment and the la boratory. Since many biological and environmental samples contain low levels of zinc, it is easy to contaminate samples. Thus, it is imperative that special precautions be taken to avoid sample contamination in order to obtain accurate results and ensure the integrity of samples. Precautions must be taken to avoid contamination during sample collection and analysis from sources such as sampling and filtratio n equipment, inadequate reagent purity, and atmospheric deposition. For ultratrace analysis, the use of a clean-room laboratory with a laminar flow work station is highly recommended to avoid contamination of samples and standards with airborne particulates. In blood analysis, collection tubes are potential sources of zinc contamination (Delves 1981). An example of failure to institute proper meas ures to control sample contamination, which led to inaccuracies in reported data, was described by Windom et al. (1991). Methods that can be used to avoid reporting erroneous results include interlaboratory da ta comparison (Galloway et al. 1983) or use of standard reference materials, such as certified SRM 1549 (nonfat powdered milk) available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Perry 1990). Zinc concentrations are typically quantified using instrumental methods such as atomic absorption, emission, or mass spectroscopies; x-ray fluorescence; electro-analytical techniques (e.g., stripping voltammetry); and neutron activation analysis. ZINC 192 7. ANALYTICAL METHODS 7.1 BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS Table 7-1 lists the applicable analytical methods used for determining zinc in biological fluids and tissues. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) is used for zinc determinations in blood and tissue samples (NIOSH Method 8005) and in urine (NIOSH Method 8310). Detection limits in blood and tissue are 1 \u00b5g/100 g and 0.2 \u00b5g/g, respec tively, with recoveries of 100% (NIOSH 1994). Sample preparation involves acid digestion with concen trated acids. Detection of zinc in urine samples requires extraction of the metals with a polydithiocarba mate resin prior to digestion and analysis (NIOSH 1984). Detection limits in urine are 0.1 \u00b5g/sample. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP\u00adMS) has been used to determine the concentration of zinc in milk samples and brain tissue (Panayi et al. 2002; Patterson et al. 1992). Detection limits ar e 0.06 \u00b5g/sample for milk and 10.7 ng/g (for a 150 mg sample) for brain tissue samples. Recoveries range d from 99-111% for brain tissue samples (Panayi et al. 2002). Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) is a common a nd simple laboratory technique capable of routine zinc analysis of biological samples including bone, live r, hair, blood, and urine. Graphite furnace AAS (GF-AAS) is more sensitive than flame AAS and has b een used to determine very low levels of zinc (detection limit, 0.052 \u00b5mol/L) in human milk (Arnaud et al. 1991) . GF-AAS has been used to determine zinc in human semen. Recovery (96-104%) was good, and preparation by microwave wet acid dissolution was more accurate than the standard water dilution method (Alvarado et al. 1991). Zinc concentrations in liver have been accurately quantified by flame AAS. Homogenization of tissue samples coupled with flame AAS resulted in 100% recove ries, accuracies of 0-3%, and a detection limit of 0.04 mg/L (Luterotti et al. 1992). AAS has also been used to determine zinc in bloodstains on filter paper. This method is accurate, reproducible, and acceptable for routine clinical testing using both dry ashing and direct extraction sample preparation (Fan et al. 1991). The use of stable isotopes or tracers to study zinc ab sorption in humans with subsequent analysis by mass spectrometry has been reported in the literature. Analys is of fecal samples obtained 3 and 6 days after the administration of zinc-65 isotope in food showed that between 45 and 75% of zinc isotope was absorbed (Johnson 1982). The results indicated satisfactory det ection of the zinc-67 isotope in human feces, while the zinc-70 isotope was not as detectable. Bette r precision and recovery were obtained for the zinc-67 isotope (2.4% CV isotope (38% ZINC 193 7. ANALYTICAL METHODS Table 7-1.

Sample detec tion limits were not reported. Tota l reported sample preparation time was <2 hours, and it took only 5-10 minutes to analyze each sample on the mass spectrometer. Multi-elemental analysis has been used to detect zi nc and other trace metals in biological fluids and tissues. For determination of metallic constituents in biological samples, such as liver, samples were digested with mixtures of different acids, volatile elements were distilled by selective distillation, and a cleanup step was performed using ion exchange ch romatography prior to assay by neutron activation analysis (NAA) (Lievens et al. 1977). Recovery (98%) and precision (<10% CV) were excellent. Although the limit of detection for zinc was not reported, based on the reported results, this method can detect levels ranging from the low- to the sub-ppm range (Lievens et al. 1977). The NAA technique has also been used to detect zinc in urine and blood samples. Jurgensen and Behne (1977) used the technique to measure human serum levels of trace elements incl uding zinc. Recovery and precision for this method are very good. Sensitivity was not reported. A practical method, based on NAA, was developed fo r accurate measurement of the stable isotopes zinc-68 and zinc-70 in human plas ma and red blood cells (Janghorbani et al. 1981). This method can provide an alternative to the use of radiolabeled zinc . It is more complex and time consuming than those used to measure radiolabeled zinc levels. As with any isotopic method, isotope exchange may invalidate calculation of net absorption, but this potential problem was not investigated. Precision was very good (<10%). Sensitivity and accuracy were not reported. Radionuclide studies offer an additional method to investigate the factors that affect trace element absorption. Radioactivity emitted by the radionuclide was measured in blood 14 days after the oral ingestion of zinc-65 and compared with the amount of radioactivity emission determined by whole-body counting (Watson et al. 1987). The results indicated that, where whole-body counting facilities were not available, measurement of radioactivity emitted in bl ood was a reasonable alternative for the prediction of zinc absorption. Recovery for this method was ad equate (88%); precision was acceptable (<17% CV). The limit of detection for zinc was not reported. Other analytical methods include flow injection analysis (FIA). FIA has been used to determine very low levels of zinc in muscle tissue. This method pr ovides very high sensitivity, low detection limits (3 ng/mL), good precision, and high selectivity at trace levels (Fernandez et al. 1992b). ZINC 197 7. ANALYTICAL METHODS Animal and human tissues samples are usually analyzed without drying and concentrations are reported as wet weight. For some samples, freeze-drying has been used. Care should be taken during the acid dissolution of blood and urine samples as frothing of natural surfactants during digestion can lead to losses. This problem can be prevented by allowing th e sample to stand overnight after the addition of acid (WHO 2001). 7.2 ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES Table 7-2 lists the methods used for analyzing zinc in environmental samples. ICP-AES is used to determine concentrations of zi nc in air (NIOSH method 7300), water (EPA methods Detection limits in air, water, and solid wastes are 0.6, 2, and, 2 \u00b5g/L, respectively (AOAC 1998; EPA 1994; NIOSH 1994). Preparation for water samples typically involves acid digestion with concentrated acids. The concentration of zinc in soil was de termined by ICP-AES coupled with an ammonium bicarbonate-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (NH4HCO3-DTPA) extraction procedure. This method can be used to screen soils for zinc (Boon and Soltanp our 1991). ICP-MS has been used to determine the concentration of zinc in water (EPA methods 200.8, 1638; APHA method 3125 B), (APHA 1998; EPA 1994, 1996). Detection limits have been reported to be as low as 0.017 \u00b5g/L using 66Zn isotope. Recoveries range from 99 to 117% (APHA 1998). Flame AAS has been used to determine zinc concentrations in natural waters (Fishman 1966). AAS is a rapid method of measuring zinc, with a detection limit of 0.005 ppm. Brooks et al. (1967) demonstrated a simple extraction system consisting of two reagents , ammonium pyrollidine dithiocarbamate (APDC) and methyl isobutylketone (MIBK), with subsequent an alysis by flame AAS to measure particulate and \"soluble\" zinc in seawater. Sensitivity was in the sub-ppm range, and precision was good (3% CV). Flame AAS, coupled with microwave digestion and GF-AAS, has been used to determine the concentration of zinc in food and shellfish samples. Limits of detection ranged from 0.12 to 0.24 ppm, with recoveries ranging from 80 to 113%. Precision and recovery using microwave digestion were comparable to traditional wet ashing and superior to dry ashing in shellfish samples (AOAC 1984; McCarthy and Ellis 1991; Morales-Rubio et al. 1992). GF-AAS was also used to determine low levels of zinc in beer. Recovery (94-106%) and precision (4.2 % CV) were excellent. Sensitivity was not reported (Wagner et al. 1991). Flame AAS has been used to me asure heavy metals, including zinc, in various oil ZINC 198 7. ANALYTICAL METHODS Table 7-2.

ANALYTICAL METHODS samples collected at different stages of oil refining (Elson et al. 1981). These samples were prepared using three techniques (digestion, extraction, and dilution) prior to AAS analysis; recovery from crude oil was higher with wet digestion. Sensitivity for zinc was in the low-ppm range. Cathodic stripping voltammetry, also known as adsorpti on voltammetry, has been used to detect various metal ions in a 10-10-10-11 M range in seawater (van den Berg 1986). APDC was used as a chelating agent for zinc. Because of the great sensitivity and specificity of AP DC for zinc, it can be detected directly in the unaltered sample. Similarly, di fferential pulse cathodic stripping voltammetry (DPCSV) and differential voltammetry (DPA SV) after complexation with APDC have been used for determining zinc speciation at nanomolar concentrations in ocean waters (Donat and Bruland 1990). Anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) has been used to detect zinc and other metal ions simultaneously at trace levels in atmospheric aerosols. This method is primarily used for small samples with very low concentrations of zinc. The limit of detection was 13.7 ng/L (Casassas et al. 1991). An ion chromatographic method has been proposed for simultaneous determination of several elements including zinc in soil (Basta and Tabatabai 1990). In this method, after preliminary sample treatment, the metals are separated by ion chromatography, and the separated elements are quantified by ultraviolet- visible detection of zinc-PAR (4-[2-pyridylazo] resorcinol) colored complexes. The limit of detection for zinc by this method was 5 ppb in soil extract. Precision was 2.5% CV. Other analytical methods include energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence (EDXRF). This technique has been used to detect zinc in dried food samples with better precision (e.g., detection limit, 0.8 ppm) than AAS methods (Nielson et al. 1991). 7.3 ADEQUACY OF THE DATABASE Section 104(i)(5) of CERCLA, as amended, directs the Administrator of ATSDR (in consultation with the Administrator of EPA and agencies and programs of the Public Health Service) to assess whether adequate information on the health effects of zinc is available. Where adequate information is not available, ATSDR, in conjunction w ith NTP, is required to assure the initiation of a program of research designed to determine the health effects (and techniques for developing methods to determine such health effects) of zinc. ZINC 202 7. ANALYTICAL METHODS The following categories of possible data needs have been identified by a joint team of scientists from ATSDR, NTP, and EPA. They are defined as substance-specific informational needs that if met would reduce the uncertainties of human health assessment. This definition should not be interpreted to mean that all data needs discussed in this section must be filled. In the future, the identified data needs will be evaluated and prioritized, and a substance-sp ecific research agenda will be proposed. 7.3.1 Identification of Data Needs Methods for Determining Biomarkers of Exposure and Effect. Exposure. ICP-AES, ICP-MS, and AAS are the most commonly used analytical methods to determine zinc levels in plasma, bone, fingernails, hair, and other biological tissues and body fluids (Alvarado et al. 1991; AOAC 1990; Arnaud et al. 1991; Langmyhr et al. Panayi et et al. 1982; Sohler et al. 1976; Szpunar et al. 1978; Takagi et al. 1988; Wilhelm et al. 1991). These methods generally are sensitive enough to measure background levels in the populati on and levels at which biological effects occur. However, improved sensitivit y and recovery data are needed in order to better evaluate the relationship between body and environmen tal exposure levels of zinc. Other methods that are specific for measuring zinc in biological fluids and tissues include NAA, FIA, and isotope tracers techniques (Fernandez et al. 1992b; Janghorbani et Johnson 1982; Lievens NIOSH 1984a; Watson et al. 1987). Sensitivit y and/or recovery data for these methods are needed to more fully evaluate the reliability of these methods as predictors of environmental exposure. Effect. Although several biomarkers for the effects of zinc have been identified (increased levels of serum amylases and lipase, noniron responsive anemia , and decreased HDL cholesterol levels), these biomarkers of effect are not specific for zinc (Cotra n et al. 1989; Suber 1989). Standard laboratory tests are available that can measure these biomarkers (Henry 1984). These methods are sensitive, accurate, and reliable enough to measure background levels in the population and levels at which biological effects occur. The development of methods for determining biomarkers of effect specific for zinc would be beneficial in assessing whether an individual has been exposed to elevated levels of zinc. Methods for Determining Parent Compounds and Degradation Products in Environmental Media. Methods of adequate sensitivity and specificity are available for determining levels of zinc in ZINC 203 7. ANALYTICAL METHODS environmental media (AOAC 1984; APHA and Ellis et al. 1992; Nielson et al. 1991; NIOSH van den Berg 1986; Wagner et al. 1991; Zoller et al. 1974). Most of these methods are precise and sensitive enough to measure background levels in the environment a nd levels at which health effects occur. Some methods can distinguish between soluble zinc, insoluble zinc, and chelated zinc in water (Donat and Bruland 1990). 7.3.2 Ongoing Studies The information in Table 7-3 was found as a result of a search of the Federal Research in Progress database (FEDRIP 2004) ZINC 204 7.

REGULATIONS AND ADVISORIES Zinc (fume and dust) and its compounds are on the list of chemicals appear ing in \"Toxic Chemicals Subject to Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986\" (EPA 2003j). The national and state regulations and guidelines pert aining to zinc and compounds in air, water, food, and other media are summarized in Table 8-1. No international regulations or guidelines applicable to zinc or its compounds were found. ATSDR has derived an intermediate-duration oral MR L of 0.3 mg Zn/kg/day for zinc based on decreased erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, a sensitive indicator of body copper status, and changes in serum ferritin in women given supplements containing zinc gluconate for 10 w eeks (Yadrick et al. 1989). It should be noted that the MRL is calculated based on th e assumption of healthy dietary levels of zinc (and copper), and represents the level of exposure above and beyond the norma l diet that is believed to be without an appreciable risk of toxic response. The MR L is based on soluble zinc salts; it is less likely that nonsoluble zinc compounds would have these effects at similar exposure levels. The intermediate oral MRL has been adopted as the chronic oral MRL. EPA has derived an oral reference dose (RfD) of 0.3 mg/kg/day for zinc (IRIS 2005). EPA has not derived an inhalation reference concentration (RfC) for zinc. ZINC 206 8. REGULATIONS AND ADVISORIES Table 8-1.

Acute Exposure\u2014 Exposure to a chemical for a duration of 14 days or less, as specified in the Toxicological Profiles. Adsorption\u2014The adhesion in an extremely thin layer of molecu les (as of gases, solutes, or liquids) to the surfaces of solid bodies or liquids with which they are in contact. Adsorption Coefficient (K oc)\u2014The ratio of the amount of a chemical adsorbed per unit weight of organic carbon in the soil or sediment to the concentr ation of the chemical in solution at equilibrium. Adsorption Ratio (Kd)\u2014 The amount of a chemical adsorbed by sediment or soil (i.e., the solid phase) divided by the amount of chemical in the solution phase, which is in equilibrium with the solid phase, at a fixed solid/solution ratio. It is generally expressed in micrograms of chemical sorbed per gram of soil or sediment. Anthropogenic \u2014Caused by human activities. Benchmark Dose (BMD)\u2014 Usually defined as the lower confidence limit on the dose that produces a specified magnitude of changes in a specified adverse response. For example, a BMD 10 would be the dose at the 95% lower confidence limit on a 10% res ponse, and the benchmark response (BMR) would be 10%. The BMD is determined by modeling the dose response curve in the regi on of the dose response relationship where biologically observable data are feasible. Benchmark Dose Model\u2014A statistical dose-response model applied to either experimental toxicological or epidemiological data to calculate a BMD. Bioconcentration Factor (BCF)\u2014The quotient of the concentration of a chemical in aquatic organisms at a specific time or during a discrete time period of exposure divided by the concentration in the surrounding water at the same time or during the same period. Biomarkers\u2014 Broadly defined as indicators signaling events in biologic systems or samples. They have been classified as markers of exposure, marker s of effect, and markers of susceptibility. Cancer Effect Level (CEL)\u2014 The lowest dose of chemical in a study, or group of studies, that produces significant increases in the incidence of cancer (or tumors) between the exposed population and its appropriate control. Carcinogen\u2014 A chemical capable of inducing cancer. Case-Control Study\u2014 A type of epidemiological study that examines the relationship between a particular outcome (disease or condition) and a va riety of potential causative agents (such as toxic chemicals). In a case-controlled study, a group of pe ople with a specified and well-defined outcome is identified and compared to a similar group of people without outcome. ZINC 302 10. GLOSSARY Case Report\u2014 Describes a single individual with a particular disease or exposure. These may suggest some potential topics for scientific research, but are not actual research studies. Case Series\u2014 Describes the experience of a small number of individuals with the same disease or exposure. These may suggest potential topics for scien tific research, but are not actual research studies. Ceiling Value\u2014 A concentration of a substance that shoul d not be exceeded, even instantaneously. Chronic Exposure\u2014 Exposure to a chemical for 365 days or more, as specified in the Toxicological Profiles.

GLOSSARY Uncertainty Factor (UF)\u2014 A factor used in operationally deriving the Minimal Risk Level (MRL) or Reference Dose (RfD) or Reference Concentration (R fC) from experimental data. UFs are intended to account for (1) the variation in sensitivity among the members of the human population, (2) the uncertainty in extrapolating animal data to the case of human, (3) the uncertainty in extrapolating from data obtained in a study that is of less than lifetime exposure, and (4) the uncertainty in using lowest\u00ad observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) data rather than no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) data. A default for each individual UF is 10; if complete certainty in data exists, a value of 1 can be used; however, a reduced UF of 3 may be used on a case-by-case basis, 3 being the approximate logarithmic average of 10 and 1. Xenobiotic\u2014 Any chemical that is foreign to the biological system. ZINC A-1 APPENDIX A. ATSDR MINIMAL RISK LEVELS AND WORKSHEETS The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compen sation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) [42 U.S.C. as amended by the ts and Reauthorization Act (SARA) [Pub. L. 99- 499], requires that the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) develop jointly with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in order of priority, a list of hazardous substances most commonly found at facilities on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL); prepare toxicological profiles for each substance included on the priority list of hazardous substances; and assure the initiation of a research program to fill identified da ta needs associated with the substances. The toxicological profiles include an examination, su mmary, and interpretation of available toxicological information and epidemiologic evaluations of a hazardous substance. During the development of toxicological profiles, Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs) ar e derived when reliable and sufficient data exist to identify the target organ(s) of effect or the most sen sitive health effect(s) for a specific duration for a given route of exposure. An MRL is an estimate of the daily human exposure to a hazardous substance that is likely to be without appreciable risk of a dverse noncancer health effects over a specified duration of exposure. MRLs are based on noncancer health effects only and are not based on a consideration of cancer effects. These substance-specific estimates, which are intended to serve as screening levels, are used by ATSDR health assessors to identify contamin ants and potential health effects that may be of concern at hazardous waste sites. It is important to note that MRLs are not intended to define clean-up or action levels. MRLs are derived for hazardous substances using the no- observed-adverse-effect level/uncertainty factor approach. They are below levels that might cause a dverse health effects in the people most sensitive to such chemical-induced effects. MRLs are derived fo r acute (1-14 days), intermediate (15-364 days), and chronic (365 days and longer) durations and for the oral and inhalation routes of exposure. Currently, MRLs for the dermal route of exposure are not derived because ATSDR has not yet identified a method suitable for this route of exposure. MRLs are gene rally based on the most sensitive chemical-induced end point considered to be of relevance to humans. Serious health effects (such as irreparable damage to the liver or kidneys, or birth defects) are not used as a basis for establishing MRLs. Exposure to a level above the MRL does not mean that ad verse health effects will occur. ZINC A-2 APPENDIX A MRLs are intended only to serve as a screening tool to help public health professionals decide where to look more closely. They may also be viewed as a mechanism to identify those hazardous waste sites that are not expected to cause adverse health effects. Most MRLs contain a degree of uncertainty because of the lack of precise toxicological information on th e people who might be most sensitive (e.g., infants, elderly, nutritionally or immunologically compromised) to the effects of hazardous substances. ATSDR uses a conservative (i.e., protective) approach to addre ss this uncertainty consistent with the public health principle of prevention. Although human data are pr eferred, MRLs often must be based on animal studies because relevant human studies are lacking. In th e absence of evidence to the contrary, ATSDR assumes that humans are more sensitive to the effects of hazard ous substance than animals and that certain persons may be particularly sensitive. Thus, the resulting MRL may be as much as 100-fold below levels that have been shown to be nontoxic in laboratory animals. Proposed MRLs undergo a rigorous review process: Health Effects/MRL Workgroup reviews within the Division of Toxicology, expert panel peer reviews, and agency-wide MRL Workgroup reviews, with participation from other federal agencies and comment s from the public. They are subject to change as new information becomes available concomitant with updating the toxicological profiles. Thus, MRLs in the most recent toxicological profiles supersede prev iously published levels. For additional information regarding MRLs, please contact the Division of Toxicology, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1600 Clifton Road NE, Mailstop F-32, Atlanta, Georgia 30333. ZINC A-3 APPENDIX A MINIMAL RISK LEVEL (MRL) WORKSHEET Chemical name: Zinc and compounds CAS number: Date: May 6, 2005 Profile status: Final Draft Post-Public Route: [ ] Inhalation [X] Oral Duration: [ ] Acute [X] Intermediate [ ] Chronic Key to figure: 25 Species: Human MRL: 0.3 [X] mg/kg/day [ [ Yadrick MK, Kenney MA, Winte rfelt EA. 1989. Iron, copper, and zinc status: Response to supplementation with zinc or zinc and iron in adult females. Am J Clin Nutr 49:145-150. Experimental design : Eighteen healthy women, ages 25-40 years, were given zinc gluconate supplements twice daily (50 mg supplemental zinc/day, or 0.83 mg supplemental zinc/kg/day assuming a 60-kg mean body weight for healthy women) for a 10-week period (Yadrick et al. 1989). Blood was drawn from each subject prior to treatment for use as a referent. Erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (ESOD) activity declined over the 10-week supplementation period and, at 10 weeks, was significantly (p<0.05) lower (47% decrease) than pretreatment va lues; a decrease at 6 weeks of exposure (15%) was not statistically significant. ESOD levels are consid ered to be a sensitive indicator of systemic copper status. Ceruloplasmin levels were not altered. Serum zinc was significantly increased at both 6 and 10 weeks. There was also a significant decline in serum ferritin (23%) and hematocrit (4%) values at 10 weeks. In women similarly-exposed but also receiving 0.42 mg supplemental iron/day, serum ferritin was increased at both 6 and 10 weeks of exposure, while serum ESOD levels were significantly decreased at 6 weeks (24%) and 10 weeks (47%). Effects noted in study and corresponding doses : Statistically significant decreases in erythrocyte SOD and serum ferritin levels at 0.83 mg supplemental zinc /kg/day. Since these effects were subclinical, they were designated as non-adverse, as described below. Dose end point used for MRL derivation : Yadrick et al. (1989) reported a significant decrease in ESOD, which is considered to be a sensitive indicator of body copper status, in women exposed to 50 mg supplemental zinc/day. Because the observed effect is considered to be a precursor event to the more severe symptoms seen with zinc-induced copper deficiency, rather than a toxic effect of itself, the 50 mg supplemental zinc/day value is considered to be NOAEL. At the same exposure level, serum ferritin levels decreased from 36.6 to 28.2 \u00b5g/L (23% decrease) , which was statistically significant. According to the most recent NHANES data (cited in IOM 2000), the median range for serum ferritin levels in menstruating women is 36-40 \u00b5g/L, while a value of <12 \u00b5g/L represents depleted iron stores. Thus, the subjects dropped below the median range for women of their age group, but were still considerably above the level that would represent a depletion of iron stor es; in the absence of other effects indicating changes in iron status, this subclinical effect was also d esignated as a NOAEL. Assuming a reference female body weight of 60 kg, this represents 0.83 mg zinc/kg/day. [X] NOAEL [ ] LOAEL ZINC A-4 APPENDIX A Uncertainty factors used in MRL derivation : [ ] 1 [ ] 3 [ ] 10 (for use of a LOAEL) [ ] 1 [ ] 3 [ ] 10 (for extrapolation from animals to humans) [ ] 1 [X] 3 [ ] 10 (for human variability) The intermediate oral MRL for zinc is derived as follows : MRL = UF MRL = MRL = 0.3 mg zinc/kg/day Was a conversion factor used from ppm in food or water to a mg/body weight dose? No. Was a conversion used from intermittent to continuous exposure? If so, explain : No. If an inhalation study in animals, list conversion f actors used in determining human equivalent dose : Not applicable. Other additional studies or pertinent info rmation that lend support to this MRL : It should be noted that the MRL is calculated based on the assumption of healthy dietary levels of zinc (and copper), and represents the level of exposure above and beyond the normal diet that is believed to be without an appreciable risk of toxic response. Fischer et al. (1984) gave groups of 13 healthy adult male volunteers (ages not specified) 0 (cornstarch) or 25 mg supplemental zinc (as zinc gluconate) twi ce daily for 6 weeks (0 or 0.71 mg supplemental zinc/kg/day). Nonfasting blood samples were taken at th e beginning and at biweekly intervals and tested for measures of copper status. ESOD activity decreased after 4 weeks in the supplement group and was significantly lower than controls by 6 weeks. An inverse correlation between plasma zinc levels and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity was also obser ved at 6 weeks. Plasma copper levels and levels of ferroxidase activity did not change during the course of the study. Groups (n=10-13) of postmenopausal women (mean age 64.9\u00b16.7 years) with an average body weight of 65.1\u00b19.5 kg were evaluated for the effects of excess zi nc exposure (Davis et al. 2000; Milne et al., 2001). After an initial equilibration period dur ing which they received 2 mg Cu and 9 mg zinc/day (the RDA for women of that age is 8 mg zinc/day) for 10 days, subjects received either low (1 mg) or high (3 mg) copper diets, and either low (3 mg) or high (56 mg) zinc for 90 days; it is noteworthy that the \"low copper\" subjects were still receiving copper levels greater than the current RDA for copper. After a 10-day equilibration period, the study was repeated with the same copper level in the diet, such that each subject received both low and high zinc throughout the course of the study. Blood was drawn during each equilibration period, and twice monthly during the ex posure periods. Levels during the equilibration periods were used as the referent for the exposure periods. Zinc supplementation resulted in significant increases in plasma and platelet zinc levels. In high-zinc subjects, increases were seen and extracellular cell 5' -nucleotidase (~30%) and plasma 5'-nucleotidase activity were also seen in erythrocyte copper/zinc SOD and plasma free thyroxine. Other evaluated end points were not signifi cantly modified by zinc supplementation. Copper status indicators were decreased by suppleme ntation with zinc, including copper balance (total intake-total eliminated in urine and feces), serum-immunoreactive ceruloplasmin, platelet glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase activity. No effect was seen on concentration of zinc in red blood cells or on indicators of iron status. Groups of 9, 13, or 9 healthy white men were administ ered 0, 50, or 75 mg/day supplemental zinc as zinc gluconate (total zinc intakes were 0.16, 0.85, and 1. 10 mg supplemental zinc/kg/day, respectively, based on mean group body weights) for 12 weeks (Black et al. 1988). The subjects were given instructions to avoid foods high in calcium, fiber, and phytic acid, dietary constituents that are known to decrease zinc absorption. Subjects were also told to restrict thei r intake of zinc-rich foods in order to minimize the variation in daily dietary zinc. There was a genera l decline in the mean serum HDL-cholesterol for the 75-mg supplement group between weeks 6 and 12. HD L values for this group were significantly lower than those for the placebo group at weeks 6 and 12 (p<0 .05). There was also a decline in the HDL values for the 50-mg group between weeks 8 through 12; howe ver, this decline was not significantly different from that for the controls until the 12th week of tr eatment. Serum zinc, copper, total cholesterol, LDL- cholesterol, and triglycerides did not appear to be affected by treatment. Freeland-Graves et al. (1982) exposed groups of eight healthy women to 0, 15, 50, or 100 mg supplemental zinc as zinc acetate (approximately 0, 0.25, 0.83, or 1.7 mg supplemental zinc/kg/day, assuming a reference female body weight of 60 kg) daily for 60 days. In the highest exposure group only, plasma HDL-cholesterol was significantly reduced at 4 weeks of exposure, but not at any other timepoint examined. A correlation between dietary zinc and whol e-blood copper was observed in treated subjects. In the 50 and 100 mg groups, some bloating, nausea, and abdominal cramps were reported unless the supplement was taken with a large glass of water at mealtime. Prasad et al. (1978) fed a patient with sickle ce ll anemia supplements of 150-200 mg supplemental zinc/day for 2 years. The supplement resulted in copper deficiency; serum copper and plasma ceruloplasmin levels were decreased. When copper was administered, the plasma ceruloplasmin levels became normal. In a follow-up study, of 13 patient s on zinc therapy (similar treatment levels assumed), 7 patients had ceruloplasmin levels at the lowe r limit of normal after 24 weeks of dosing.

USER'S GUIDE Chapter 1 Public Health Statement This chapter of the profile is a health effects su mmary written in non-technical language. Its intended audience is the general public, especially people living in the vicinity of a hazardous waste site or chemical release. If the Public Health Statement were removed from the rest of the document, it would still communicate to the lay public essential information about the chemical. The major headings in the Public Health Statement are useful to find specific topics of concern. The topics are written in a question and answer format. The answer to each questi on includes a sentence that will direct the reader to chapters in the profile th at will provide more information on the given topic. Chapter 2 Relevance to Public Health This chapter provides a health effects summary based on evaluations of existing toxicologic, epidemiologic, and toxicokinetic in formation. This summary is designed to present interpretive, weight\u00ad of-evidence discussions for human health end po ints by addressing the following questions: 1. What effects are known to occur in humans? 2. What effects observed in animals are likely to be of concern to humans? 3. What exposure conditions are likely to be of concern to humans, especially around hazardous waste sites? The chapter covers end points in the same order that they appear within the Discussion of Health Effects by Route of Exposure section, by route (inhalation, oral, and dermal) and within route by effect. Human data are presented first, then animal data. Both ar e organized by duration (acute, intermediate, chronic). In vitro data and data from parenteral routes (intramusc ular, intravenous, subcutaneous, etc.) are also considered in this chapter. The carcinogenic potential of the profiled substance is qualitatively evaluated, when appropriate, using existing toxicokinetic, genotoxic, and carcinogenic data. ATSDR does not currently assess cancer potency or perform cancer risk assessments. Minima l Risk Levels (MRLs) for noncancer end points (if derived) and the end points from which they were derived are indicated and discussed. Limitations to existing scientific literature that preven t a satisfactory evaluation of the relevance to public health are identified in the Chapter 3 Data Needs section. Interpretation of Minimal Risk Levels Where sufficient toxicologic information is availabl e, ATSDR has derived MRLs for inhalation and oral routes of entry at each duration of exposure (acute, intermediate, and chronic). These MRLs are not ZINC B-2 APPENDIX B meant to support regulatory action, but to acquaint he alth professionals with e xposure levels at which adverse health effects are not expected to occur in humans. MRLs should help physicians and pu blic health officials determine the safety of a community living near a chemical emission, given the concentration of a contam inant in air or the estimated daily dose in water. MRLs are based largely on toxicological studies in animals and on reports of human occupational exposure. MRL users should be familiar with the toxicologic info rmation on which the number is based. Chapter 2, \"Relevance to Public Health,\" contains basic informa tion known about the substance. Other sections such as Chapter 3 Section 3.9, \"Interactions with Other Substances,\" and Section 3.10, \"Populations that are Unusually Susceptible\" provide important supplemental information. MRL users should also understand the MRL derivation methodology. MRLs are derived using a modified version of the risk assessment methodology that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides (Barnes and Dourson 1988) to determine reference doses (RfDs) for lifetime exposure. To derive an MRL, ATSDR generally selects the most sensitive end point which, in its best judgement, represents the most sensitive human health effect for a given exposure route and duration. ATSDR cannot make this judgement or derive an MRL unless information (quantitative or qualitative) is available for all potential systemic, neurological, and developm ental effects. If this information and reliable quantitative data on the chosen end point are availabl e, ATSDR derives an MRL using the most sensitive species (when information from multiple species is availa ble) with the highest no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) that does not exceed any adverse eff ect levels. When a NOAEL is not available, a lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) can be u sed to derive an MRL, and an uncertainty factor (UF) of 10 must be employed. Additional uncertainty factors of 10 must be used both for human variability to protect sensitive subpopulations (peopl e who are most susceptible to the health effects caused by the substance) and for interspecies vari ability (extrapolation from animals to humans). In deriving an MRL, these individual uncertainty factors are multiplied together. The product is then divided into the inhalation concentration or oral dosage selected from the study. Uncertainty factors used in developing a substance-specific MRL are provided in the footnotes of the levels of significant exposure (LSE) tables. Chapter 3 Health Effects Tables and Figures for Levels of Significant Exposure (LSE) Tables and figures are used to summarize health effe cts and illustrate graphica lly levels of exposure associated with those effects. These levels cover health effects observed at increasing dose concentrations and durations, diffe rences in response by species, MRLs to humans for noncancer end points, and EPA's estimated range associated with an upper- bound individual lifetime cancer risk of 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 10,000,000. Use the LSE tables and figures for a quick review of the health effects and to locate data for a specific exposure scenario. The LSE tables and figures should always be used in conjunction with the text. All entries in these tables and figures represent studies that provide reliable, quantitative estimates of NOAELs, LOAELs , or Cancer Effect Levels (CELs). The legends presented below demonstrate the application of these tables and figures. Representative examples of LSE Table 3-1 and Figure 3-1 are shown. The numbers in the left column of the legends correspond to the numbers in the example table and figure. ZINC B-3 APPENDIX B LEGEND See Sample LSE Table 3-1 (page B-6) (1) Route of Exposure. One of the first considerations when reviewing the toxicity of a substance using these tables and figures should be the relevant and appropriate route of exposure. Typically when sufficient data exist, three LSE tables a nd two LSE figures are presented in the document. The three LSE tables present data on the three princi pal routes of exposure, i.e., inhalation, oral, and dermal (LSE Tables 3-1, 3-2, and 3-3, respec tively). LSE figures are limited to the inhalation (LSE Figure 3-1) and oral (LSE Figure 3-2) routes. Not all substances will have data on each route of exposure and will not, therefore, have all five of the tables and figures. (2) Exposure Period . Three exposure periods\u2014acute (less than 15 days), intermediate (15- 364 days), and chronic (365 days or more)\u2014are prese nted within each relevant route of exposure. In this example, an inhalation study of interm ediate exposure duration is reported. For quick reference to health effects occurring from a know n length of exposure, locate the applicable exposure period within the LSE table and figure. (3) Health Effect . The major categories of health effects included in LSE tables and figures are death, systemic, immunological, neurological , developmental, reproductive, and cancer. NOAELs and LOAELs can be reported in the tables and figures for all effects but cancer. Systemic effects are further defined in the \"S ystem\" column of the LSE table (see key number 18). (4) Key to Figure . Each key number in the LSE table links study information to one or more data points using the same key number in the correspondi ng LSE figure. In this example, the study represented by key number 18 has been used to derive a NOAEL and a Less Serious LOAEL (also see the two \"18r\" data points in sample Figure 3-1). (5) Species. The test species, whether animal or human, are identified in this column. Chapter 2, \"Relevance to Public Health,\" covers the rele vance of animal data to human toxicity and Section 3.4, \"Toxicokinetics,\" contains any available information on comparative toxicokinetics. Although NOAELs and LOAELs are species specific, the levels are extrapolated to equivalent human doses to derive an MRL. (6) Exposure Frequency/Duration . The duration of the study an d the weekly and daily exposure regimens are provided in this column. This permits comparison of NOAELs and LOAELs from different studies. In this case (key number 18), ra ts were exposed to \"Chemical x\" via inhalation for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week, for 13 weeks. For a more complete review of the dosing regimen, refer to the appropriate sections of the text or the original reference paper (i.e., Nitschke et al. 1981). (7) System . This column further defines the systemic effects. These systems include respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematological, musculoskeletal, hepatic, renal, and dermal/ocular. \"Other\" refers to any systemic effect (e.g., a decrease in body weight) not covered in these systems. In the example of key number 18, one systemic effect (respiratory) was investigated. (8) NOAEL . A NOAEL is the highest exposure level at which no harmful effects were seen in the organ system studied. Key number 18 reports a NOAEL of 3 ppm for the respiratory system, ZINC B-4 APPENDIX B which was used to derive an intermediate exposure, inhalation MRL of 0.005 ppm (see footnote \"b\"). (9) LOAEL . A LOAEL is the lowest dose used in the study that caused a harmful health effect. LOAELs have been classified into \"Less Serious\" and \"Serious\" effects. These distinctions help readers identify the levels of exposure at which adverse health effects first appear and the gradation of effects with increasing dose. A brie f description of the specific end point used to quantify the adverse effect accompanies the LOAEL. The respiratory effect reported in key number 18 (hyperplasia) is a Less Serious LOAEL of 10 ppm. MRLs are not derived from Serious LOAELs. (10) Reference . The complete reference citation is given in Chapter 9 of the profile. (11) CEL. A CEL is the lowest exposure level associ ated with the onset of carcinogenesis in experimental or epidemiologic studies. CELs are always considered serious effects. The LSE tables and figures do not contain NOAELs for cancer, but the text may report doses not causing measurable cancer increases. (12) Footnotes . Explanations of abbreviations or refere nce notes for data in the LSE tables are found in the footnotes. Footnote \"b\" indicates that the NOAEL of 3 ppm in key number 18 was used to derive an MRL of 0.005 ppm. LEGEND See Sample Figure 3-1 (page B-7) LSE figures graphically illustrate the data presented in the corresponding LSE tables. Figures help the reader quickly compare health effects according to exposure concentrations for particular exposure periods. (13) Exposure Period . The same exposure periods appear as in the LSE table. In this example, health effects observed within the acute and interm ediate exposure periods are illustrated. (14) Health Effect . These are the categories of health effects for which reliable quantitative data exists. The same health eff ects appear in the LSE table. (15) Levels of Exposure . Concentrations or doses for each health effect in the LSE tables are graphically displayed in the LSE figures. Exposur e concentration or dose is measured on the log scale \"y\" axis. Inhalation exposure is reported in mg/m 3 or ppm and oral exposure is reported in mg/kg/day. (16) NOAEL . In this example, the open circle designated 18r identifies a NOAEL critical end point in the rat upon which an intermediate inhalati on exposure MRL is based. The key number 18 corresponds to the entry in the LSE table. The dashed descending arrow indicates the extrapolation from the exposure level of 3 ppm (see entry 18 in the table) to the MRL of 0.005 ppm (see footnote \"b\" in the LSE table). (17) CEL. Key number 38m is one of three studies for which CELs were derived. The diamond symbol refers to a CEL for the test species-mouse. The number 38 corresponds to the entry in the LSE table. ZINC B-5 APPENDIX B (18) Estimated Upper-Bound Human Cancer Risk Levels . This is the range associated with the upper- bound for lifetime cancer risk of 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 10,000,000. These risk levels are derived from the EPA's Human Health Assessment Group's upper-bound estimates of the slope of the cancer dose response curve at low dose levels (q 1*). (19) Key to LSE Figure . The Key explains the abbreviations and symbols used in the figure. 1 SAMPLE Table 3-1.
