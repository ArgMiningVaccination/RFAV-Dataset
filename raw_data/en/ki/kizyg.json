Born to grandparents of north Indian heritage, who survived the traumas of Indo-Paki partition in 1947 and settled in Thailand, which I now call my homeland. Thus my life experiences are shaped by impacts of intergenerational trauma, race-ethnicity, gender and sexual marginalization, racism, which brings me to a deeper understanding of trauma, anxiety, grief, loss of identity and impact of life transitions. I look forward to learning more about you and hearing what brings you into therapy. Practice Information: My work at Vancouver Film School involves collaborating with youth, young adults, individuals and groups, as they bring in the struggles, worries, and confusions that impact their lives and how they show up in this world and their relationships. Together, we explore past narratives and notice dominant discourses to understand cultural and societal impacts on their beliefs, stories, and relationships. I use my openness, humility, care and genuine curiosity to provide a safe and confidential space for clients, to support their quest of discovering \"their truth\" and live life according to stories that work better for them. I believe the path to growth and healing comes from a place of awareness, compassion and acceptance. The journey to dive deep can be uncomfortable and overwhelming, and my goal is to be alongside my clients in their process of rewriting and reframing the preferred stories of their lives as experts. My areas of focus are: Stress and anxiety Depression and Dysregulation Self-esteem, shame and guilt issues LGBTQ2SIA+ populations Substance Misuse and Addictions Life Transitions and its challenges Relationship issues Trauma and PTSD OCD/negative, ruminating thoughts ADHD/ Inattention and Hyper-focus Identity issues Body image issues and disordered eating concerns Grief and loss Attachment and Separation anxiety My approach: I use a person-centered approach, weaving existentialism and mindfulness with narrative therapy. In my work, I trust my inner wisdom and intuition, as well as lean into the wisdom and teachings of master philosophers and spiritual teachers that have tread this earth and shared with us, a wealth of knowledge and guidance. My practice is very much trauma informed, and also practice a lot through lens of attachment and internal family systems. Hi, my name is Sunny. I am a registered clinical counsellor and a volunteer counsellor at "}
