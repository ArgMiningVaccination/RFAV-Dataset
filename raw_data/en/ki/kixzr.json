We now have vaccines to prevent more than 20 life-threatening diseases, helping people of all ages live longer, healthier lives. Immunization is the foundation of the primary health care system and an indisputable human right. It's also one of the best health investments money can buy. Yet despite tremendous progress, far too many people around the world - including nearly 20 million infants each year - have insufficient access to vaccines. In some countries, progress has stalled or even reversed, and there is a real risk that complacency will undermine past achievements. To address these challenges over the next decade, a new global vision and strategy, co-created by countries and development partners has been endorsed by the World Health Assembly. The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded the world of the power of vaccines to fight disease, save lives, and create a healthier, safer, and more prosperous future. Now we must rapidly and equitably deliver COVID-19 vaccines to the world. Moving forward, strong immunization systems will be needed to ensure that people everywhere are protected against COVID-19 and other diseases.

IA2030 envisions a world where everyone, everywhere, at every age, fully benefits from vaccines to improve health "}
