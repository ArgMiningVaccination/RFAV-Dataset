Whereas, homeopathic medications can strengthen your immune system, have a long-term benefit, and prevent a recurrence. Homeopathy and The Immune System Our body manifests symptoms of illnesses, but it is not the origin of the illness. The origin of illness lies in an imbalance of the vital force (force that embodies all of its functional activities). By matching the symptoms of illness with an appropriate homeopathic remedy, the humoral immunity (antibody-mediated immunity) of your body can be restored. Natural homeopathic medicines can stimulate your body's immune system to defend and heal itself.> According to a research study published in The Indian Journal of Research in Homeopathy (IJRH), homeopathic treatment is effective on patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Type 1 diabetes, or psoriasis. People with auto-immune diseases suffer because their body's immune system is over-active and it attacks their cell-mediated immunity. Homeopathic medicines do not simply stimulate the body's immune system to treat patients; they can also calm it, when it is necessary for their healing.
