Vaccination against COVID-19 plays a key role to control the current pandemic situation. The risk of allergic reactions to new COVID-19 vaccines is low. However, there is a debate on the safety in allergic patients following post marketing findings by different agencies. Our aim is to understand from current experiences whether children with cow's milk or food allergy are at higher risk than a general population for allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines. Current data indicate that patients with a history of allergy to cow's milk or other foods, even if severe, should receive COVID-19 vaccine in a setting with availability of treatments for anaphylactic reactions and under medical supervision. Recipients should be discharged after a protracted observation period of 30 min if no reaction developed.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-07-30", "cleaned_text": "COVID-19 Vaccines in Children with Cow's Milk and Food Allergies [https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13082637](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13082637) [New low risk of complications and mortality [ [5](#B5-nutrients-13-02637)]. However, several centers in Europe and United States have identified severe manifestations that can be associated with this infection, such as the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) [ [6](#B6-nutrients-13-02637), [7](#B7-nutrients-13-02637)]. Although the absolute risk of severe disease in children is low, children with comorbidities (as obesity, chronic cardiac or respiratory disease) have an increased relative risk [ [8](#B8-nutrients-13-02637)]. Moreover, infants might be seriously ill. A large European multicenter study evidenced that 48% of pediatric patients infected with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care unit were under 2 years of age [ [9](#B9-nutrients-13-02637)]. Currently, no drug effectively acts against SARS-CoV-2 [ [10](#B10-nutrients-13-02637)]. In the global attempt to control the pandemic, COVID-19 vaccines play a critical role. Widespread vaccination against COVID-19 and its emerging variants with highly effective vaccines is an essential intervention to control the current pandemic situation. COVID-19 vaccines are not yet approved for use in young children, and their registration will be crucial to prevent the spread of the disease and to improve management of children with chronic diseases such as allergic diseases [ [11](#B11-nutrients-13-02637)]. Cow's milk allergy is the most common food allergy in children. There have been some reports that cow's milk allergy or food allergy may hamper COVID-19 vaccination as it happens for other vaccines for infectious diseases. This may be a problem especially in children since cow's milk and egg tolerance often develops before adulthood [ [12](#B12-nutrients-13-02637)]. Our aim is to understand from current experiences whether the administration of COVID-19 vaccine in children with cow's milk or food allergy can be risky and whether it may be necessary to take precautions. 2. COVID-19 Vaccines and Allergic Reactions [13](#B13-nutrients-13-02637), [14](#B14-nutrients-13-02637), [15](#B15-nutrients-13-02637), [16](#B16-nutrients-13-02637)], with no fatalities reported. Data used in the majority of the studies have been collected by passive surveillance systems to evaluate the risk of anaphylaxis after vaccination. Moreover, the exact rate of anaphylaxis for each vaccine is difficult to assess because vaccines are often simultaneously given. Data are constantly checked and updated [ [17](#B17-nutrients-13-02637)]. Su et al. [ [18](#B18-nutrients-13-02637)] recently analyzed Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database for anaphylaxis after vaccination in the US for a period of 27 years, up to 2016. In children and young adults (<19 age), MMR, Varicella and DTaP/Tdap vaccines were found to elicit most of the vaccine-induced anaphylactic reactions, while the influenza vaccine was the most frequently trigger in adults. The estimated rate of anaphylaxis during the 27 years period was found to be 0.2 per million doses of PCV23 and 0.6 per million doses of MMR. In a three year period (2009-2011), McNeil et al. [ [19](#B19-nutrients-13-02637)], using Vaccine Safety Datalink, found that the rate of anaphylaxis was 1.31 per million vaccine doses administered. Adjuvants, stabilizers, animal proteins, active components, preservatives, antibiotics, and other compounds added during manufacturing can trigger allergic reactions to vaccines ( [Table 1](#nutrients-13-02637-t001)) [ [20](#B20-nutrients-13-02637), [21](#B21-nutrients-13-02637)]. [22](#B22-nutrients-13-02637)]. Currently, Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162B2 for people over 12 years old, and Moderna mRNA-1273 for people over 16 years old. Two adenovirus-vector COVID-19 vaccines include Oxford-AstraZeneca, available for use in Europe and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen that is available in the United States under Emergency Use Authorization. In phase 3 clinical trial, the new mRNA vaccines were generally well-tolerated [ [23](#B23-nutrients-13-02637)]. Mild or moderate systemic adverse events generally occurred the day after the dose and lasted 1-2 days after vaccination [ [24](#B24-nutrients-13-02637)]. In Pfizer-BioNTech trial, an anaphylactic reaction occurred [ [18](#B18-nutrients-13-02637)]. However, large clinical trials, both for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, excluded patients with \"severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component\" of their vaccine [ [23](#B23-nutrients-13-02637), [25](#B25-nutrients-13-02637)]. The Pfizer/BioNTech trial for children aged 12-15 years has not registered of adverse events, including anaphylaxis, after vaccination passively receives information from vaccine recipients and/or healthcare providers. Similar spontaneous monitoring systems are also used by other countries. It is important to remember that data on adverse events of vaccination generated by voluntary reports must be accurately and prudently evaluated. They do not prove a cause-and-effect relationship for any adverse event, because of the intrinsic shortcomings of the system. In fact, the associations that they find, can turn out to be coincidental. Moreover, a diagnosis of clinical hypersensitivity reaction that relies only on self-reported symptoms is inaccurate. For example, symptoms like hot flashes, hypotension, passing out, and other symptoms that accompany anaphylaxis can be the result of a panic attack. \"In vitro\" and \"in vivo\" allergy tests are necessary to rule in or rule out that the occurrence of these symptoms was due to an episode of anaphylaxis. [26](#B26-nutrients-13-02637)]. It reported 21 adverse events that met Brighton Collaboration criteria [ [31](#B31-nutrients-13-02637)] for anaphylaxis after administration of 1,893,360 first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (11.1 cases per million doses). Symptoms occurred in 71% of cases within 15 min of vaccination and in 18 (86%) within 30 min [ [26](#B26-nutrients-13-02637)]. No fatal events were reported. Among these 21 patients with anaphylaxis, 17 (81%) were managed in an emergency department and 4 were hospitalized (19%). A positive history of allergic reactions to drugs, insect stings or foods was found in 17 (81%) of 21 patients (19 females); a previous episode of anaphylaxis was reported in 7 patients (33%). Patients with previous allergic reaction had a history of food allergy in 3 cases (2 to eggs, 1 to cow's milk, 1 to tropical fruit), those with previous anaphylaxis in 1 case (walnuts). As of 5 February 2021, an assessment of nationwide VAERS data reported 114 cases of anaphylaxis after administration of 19,582,865 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech with an anaphylaxis rate of 5.8 cases/million doses [ [32](#B32-nutrients-13-02637)]. So, it seems that reported rate for anaphylaxis to Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine decreased with increased proportion of vaccinations. [25](#B25-nutrients-13-02637)] was 10 (all women) after administration of 4,041,396 doses of vaccine (2.5 cases per million doses) between 21 December 2020, and 10 January 2021. Among these 10 patients, 9 had previous allergic reactions. Only one out five patients with a history of anaphylaxis had anaphylaxis triggered by foods, but which foods were unspecified. As of 5 February 2021, the analysis of VAERS data showed 39 anaphylactic reactions to Moderna vaccine after administration of 17,133,644 doses with a rate of 2.3 cases/million doses [ [32](#B32-nutrients-13-02637)]. [33](#B33-nutrients-13-02637)]. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine elicited 68 (85%) anaphylactic reactions (mostly in women following the first dose of vaccine), Moderna vaccine 2 (2.5%) reactions and Vaxzevria vaccine (Oxford-AstraZeneca) 10 (12.5%) reactions. The rate of anaphylaxis was 9.7 per million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 4.7 per million of Moderna vaccine and 6.1 per million of Vaxzevria vaccine. In 23 (29%) cases of anaphylaxis, patients had a prior history of non-specific allergic reaction to foods, inhalants, or insect stings; in 28 (35%) a prior drug allergy and in 5% a previous anaphylaxis [ [26](#B26-nutrients-13-02637)]. A history of allergy to foods, insect stings or inhalants was registered for Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in 29% (20/68) of cases, 50% (1/2), and 20% (2/10) respectively. [34](#B34-nutrients-13-02637)] registered 508 cases of anaphylactic reaction with one death, 87 anaphylactic shocks, 17 anaphylactoid reactions and 3 anaphylactoid shocks out of 23.3 million first dose as of 5 May 2021. |mRNA-COVID 19 Vaccine||Reference||Period Detected||Case of Team; FDA [| 19 F 1 tropical fruit, 1 eggs and milk, 1 eggs, 1 walnuts (with anaphylaxis) [32](#B32-nutrients-13-02637)] [33](#B33-nutrients-13-02637)] 62 F unspecified food [35](#B35-nutrients-13-02637)] 6 F [ [26](#B26-nutrients-13-02637)] unspecified food [32](#B32-nutrients-13-02637)] [33](#B33-nutrients-13-02637)] 2 F unspecified food [35](#B35-nutrients-13-02637)] 9 F [35](#B35-nutrients-13-02637)] prospectively investigated for acute allergic reaction a cohort of 64,900 health care employees at Mass General Brigham (MGB) who received their first dose of a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was given in 40% of cases and Moderna vaccine in 60% of instances. Anaphylaxis was confirmed in 16 (0.025%) recipients, 9 cases after Moderna vaccine and 7 cases after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The incidence of anaphylaxis was estimated to be 27 cases per 100,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 23.1 cases per 100,000 doses of Moderna vaccine. All subjects were females, with the exception of one patient. In 10 (63%) subjects a prior allergy history was reported, and in 5 (31%) a prior anaphylaxis. A patient who reacted to Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was allergic to tree nuts and shellfish. Three patients who reacted to Moderna vaccine were allergic to tree nuts, two to peanuts and one to shellfish. None of the patients required endotracheal intubation. Several explanations can be offered for higher proportion of anaphylactic reactions reported by Blumenthal et al. [ [35](#B35-nutrients-13-02637)] compared to data from pharmacovigilance systems. Only a low proportion of adverse events following vaccinations following vaccinations are self-reported to health care professionals or to the surveillance system. Therefore, they may be underestimated. When people without medical education, voluntary submit adverse events to the surveillance system, scientific terms like \"anaphylaxis\" are not always used. [36](#B36-nutrients-13-02637)]. In patients that have been previously sensitized to a vaccine component like PEG, release of mast cell mediators can be triggered by IgE antibodies to PEG. Mast cells can be also degranulated by preexisting anti-PEG IgG antibodies or by anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a generated during complement activation by anti-PEG IgM (or IgG) antibodies. Alternatively, anaphylaxis can be the result of a pseudoallergic response that does not need a prior exposure. In these reactions, PEGylated lipid nanoparticles encapsulating mRNA can activate mast cells or basophils directly or by complement activation with production of anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a [ [36](#B36-nutrients-13-02637)]. It would be interesting to speculate on mechanisms associated with the development of immediate reactions to mRNACOVID-19 vaccines in patients with food allergy. It may be hypothesized that subjects with food allergy might be predisposed to develop pseudoallergic reactions. Studies of candidate genes associated with food allergy may be useful to comment further. 3. Vaccination in Patients with Food Allergy [37](#B37-nutrients-13-02637)]. Referring to the vaccines against SARS-Cov-2 that are currently approved all over the it is important to underline that food allergens are not present in the excipient list [ [38](#B38-nutrients-13-02637), [39](#B39-nutrients-13-02637), [40](#B40-nutrients-13-02637)]. In patients with food allergy, allergic reactions elicited by COVID-19 vaccines are not due to exposure to foods to which they are sensitized. [41](#B41-nutrients-13-02637), [42](#B42-nutrients-13-02637)]. The most common allergic food in children is cow's milk. As a matter of fact, the incidence of cow's milk allergy (CMA) is estimated to be around 2-3%, decreasing to less than 0.5% in adults [ [43](#B43-nutrients-13-02637)]. A spontaneous tolerance toward cow's milk is acquired by most allergic infants before the 3 years of age [ [44](#B44-nutrients-13-02637)]. It has been suggested that the process of resolution of CMA can be favored by the introduction of baked milk into the diet of the child [ [45](#B45-nutrients-13-02637)]. Regarding mechanisms of food allergy, IgE-mediated reactions are due to the degranulation mast cells and basophils triggered by crosslinking of IgE antibodies bound to the membrane receptors with food allergens. They are characterized by quick onset manifestations (urticaria, angioedema, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, laryngeal edema, wheezing, anaphylaxis) that develop often within 15 min up to 2 h following food intake. Delayed reactions can be mixed IgE/non IgE-mediated or non IgE-mediated. proctocolitis, enteritis, food protein enterocolitis, gastro-esophageal reflux, are believed to be due to stimulation of T cells leading to inflammation of the intestinal mucosa and increased intestinal permeability [ [46](#B46-nutrients-13-02637)]. Food allergens are usually proteins. In cow's (-lactoglobulin -lactalbumin) and the s2-, -, and -casein) are involved [ [47](#B47-nutrients-13-02637)]. With pharmaceutical manufacturing of both drugs and vaccines, several food-derived substances may be blended with the active ingredient to improve stability, give protection and support, modify availability, and ameliorate acceptability. Small amounts of food allergens in medications can rarely elicit severe allergic reactions in patients allergic to the relevant food. [ [48](#B48-nutrients-13-02637)]. Children with egg allergy are at risk of developing reactions to vaccine for measles-mumps-rubella-varicella, rabies, influenza, yellow fever that contain egg proteins. Children with milk allergy can develop anaphylaxis to cow's milk proteins that contaminate lactose in 40 is in cetuximab, antivenoms, heart valves, recombinant human coagulation factor VII, heparin, colloids can elicit allergic reactions in patients with alpha-gal allergy. Patients with gelatin allergy can present allergic reactions after intake of pork and bovine gelatin added as a stabilizer in vaccines, erythropoietin product, gelatin based hemostatic with history of allergy to different foods including cow's milk, nuts, egg, shellfish, and tropical fruits. Rojas-P\u00e9rez-Ezquerra P et al. [ [49](#B49-nutrients-13-02637)] prospectively investigated 131 patients with previous severe allergic reactions to determine whether mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could be safely given. Patients had an history of anaphylaxis (121/131,92.4%) to severe asthma, 7 patients (5.3%) chronic urticaria, and 1 patient (0.8%) mast cell activation syndrome. Skin prick tests with the mRNA vaccine and trometamol always resulted negative. Skin prick tests with PEG-3350 were positive in 2 women (1.6%). A woman had a history of anaphylaxis to drug and of idiopathic anaphylaxis. The second woman experienced anaphylaxis during vaginal delivery with epidural anesthesia. They did not receive the vaccine. Among patients who received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, a woman with severe asthma developed rhinitis and skin rash. All other vaccinations were uneventfully. A limitation of the study was the low number of adults with food allergy that were enrolled. It is also of note that anaphylactic reactions have been described in subjects without any history of allergic disease as reported in the available studies, 19-57% cases of anaphylaxis after administration of Pfizer-BioNTech [ [26](#B26-nutrients-13-02637), [35](#B35-nutrients-13-02637)] and 10-22% after Moderna COVID 19 vaccine [ [25](#B25-nutrients-13-02637), [35](#B35-nutrients-13-02637)]. Correspondingly, due to insufficient data, at the beginning of the vaccination campaign, the UK regulator stated that prior anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food was a contraindication [ [27](#B27-nutrients-13-02637)], but three weeks later, this recommendation was retired thanks to more reassuring data [ [28](#B28-nutrients-13-02637)]. Neither US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) nor US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proposed the same contraindication, though they recommended to perform a prolonged observation following vaccination and to ensure the presence of trained staff and suitable facilities in all vaccination centers [ [29](#B29-nutrients-13-02637)]. To date, allergy to food, insect venoms, drugs or inhalant allergens does not represent a contraindication for COVID-19 vaccines [ [40](#B40-nutrients-13-02637)]. Patients suffering from allergic rhinitis or controlled asthma do not show any higher risk [ [40](#B40-nutrients-13-02637)]. [26](#B26-nutrients-13-02637)]. Panic or anxiety reactions can mimic anaphylaxis, with symptoms such as flushing, tachycardia, shortness of breath or hypotension [ [50](#B50-nutrients-13-02637)]. Therefore, an accurate screening for contraindications before administering COVID-19 vaccines is mandatory. The allergist should assess patients with unclear history of food allergy to ascertain by definitive means whether they are truly allergic [ [51](#B51-nutrients-13-02637)]. It is worth of mention that severe allergic reactions are not always predictable, and they can occur in patients without previous episodes of anaphylaxis, history of allergic symptoms or hypersensitivity reactions to cow's milk or other allergens. All individuals, especially with allergy to cow's milk or other foods, should receive vaccines in a health-care infrastructure with available treatment for immediate allergic reactions and trained medical staff [ [40](#B40-nutrients-13-02637)]. Personnel should be able to early recognize signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and to promptly administer adrenaline intramuscular in the thigh that is the first therapeutic option. Another adrenaline dose should be administered after 5 min if required together with oxygen and intravenous fluid resuscitation. Emergency medical services and intensive care unit should be quickly available [ [40](#B40-nutrients-13-02637)]. Second-line treatments include antihistamines for angioedema, asthma, and oculorhinitis. In vaccines, mRNA is wrapped in lipid nanoparticles that are attached to polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules to augment stability and lifetime. PEG is widely used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals and anti-PEG IgM and IgG antibodies were measured in 72% of people [ [52](#B52-nutrients-13-02637)]. Anti-PEG IgE antibodies have been found in subjects allergic to drugs or mRNA vaccine containing PEG [ [33](#B33-nutrients-13-02637), [53](#B53-nutrients-13-02637)]. Even if, it is unclear whether anti-PEG IgE antibodies can trigger the allergic reaction to mRNA vaccines [ [54](#B54-nutrients-13-02637), [55](#B55-nutrients-13-02637)], so far, all treatments might prudently be PEG free. Understanding the rate of anti-PEG antibodies after first dose of vaccine can be helpful. The release of tryptase mainly from mast cell, occurs both in IgE-mediated and non IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. Increased serum tryptase levels, >1.2x baseline + 2 ng/L, help the diagnosis of anaphylactic reaction [ [56](#B56-nutrients-13-02637)]. However, anaphylaxis can appear when levels remain normal [ [38](#B38-nutrients-13-02637)]. Serum tryptase concentration should be measured 0.5-2 h up to 4 h after onset of the reaction, and at baseline, >24 h following resolution. In patients with history of severe allergic reactions, it is advised by national agency [ [29](#B29-nutrients-13-02637)]. and scientific societies [ [40](#B40-nutrients-13-02637)]. that the usual observation period of 15 min after vaccination should be lengthened to 30 min [ [55](#B55-nutrients-13-02637)]. Unless it is required by patient's history and needing, there is no clear evidence that it would be necessary to extend this period because of potential onset of delayed systemic symptoms, including wheezing or antibody-mediated responses such as type II and type III reactions due to IgM and IgG. Subjects with systemic allergic reaction to a vaccine should be referred to an allergist to investigate potential trigger. Local symptoms appeared in up to 80% of individuals after vaccination in the clinical trials. Recipients are not precluded from getting the second dose of COVID 19 vaccine even if large local reactions with pain, itching or swelling at the site of injection had appeared at the first dose. With reference to Moderna vaccine, delayed local hypersensitivity reactions [ [56](#B56-nutrients-13-02637)] occurring after day 8 from vaccination, have been reported. Nevertheless, the completion of the whole cycle of vaccination must be encouraged. 4. Unmet Needs [57](#B57-nutrients-13-02637)]. Larger clinical trials are warranted to establish whether mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are safe to people with mastocytosis and cow's milk allergy. In patients who experienced systemic allergic reactions with the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination, the second dose of the vaccine should not be given [ [40](#B40-nutrients-13-02637), [55](#B55-nutrients-13-02637)]. A path for allergy work-up of COVID-19 vaccination in allergic patients has been proposed [ [40](#B40-nutrients-13-02637)]. It needs to be clarified the accuracy of allergy tests with vaccine and its components to exactly understand the triggers of allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines in patients with food allergy. Along this line, it should be ascertained by definitive means that traces of food proteins have not contaminated vaccines during production process [ [37](#B37-nutrients-13-02637)]. It should be also investigated whether they may safely get the second shot with a vaccine with different excipients and active ingredient. Finally, the potential role of desensitization protocols can be assessed. 5. Conclusions [29](#B29-nutrients-13-02637), [40](#B40-nutrients-13-02637), [55](#B55-nutrients-13-02637)] that recipient can be discharged after an observation period of 30 min if no reaction developed ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-13-02637-f001)). Up to now, data are referred to adults and adolescents, but clinical trials are being carried out to evaluate the safety and efficacy in younger children.
