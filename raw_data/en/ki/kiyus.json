The present text reviews the ethnobotanical and pharmacological aspects of medicinal plants and purified molecules from natural sources with efficacy against lupus conditions. Among these molecules are artemisinin and its derivatives, antroquinonol, baicalin, curcumin, emodin, mangiferin, salvianolic acid A, triptolide, the total glycosides of paeony (TGP), and other supplements such as fatty acids and vitamins. In addition, medicinal plants, herbal remedies, mushrooms, and fungi that have been investigated for their effects on different lupus conditions through clinical trials, in vivo, in vitro, or in silico studies are reviewed. A special emphasis was placed on clinical trials, active phytochemicals, and their mechanisms of action. This review can be helpful for researchers in designing new goal-oriented studies. It can also help practitioners gain insight into recent updates on supplements that might help patients suffering from lupus conditions.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-07-19", "cleaned_text": "A Review of the Potential Benefits of Herbal Medicines, Small Molecules of Natural Sources, and Supplements for Health Promotion in Lupus Conditions [https://doi.org/10.3390/life13071589](https://doi.org/10.3390/life13071589) [Inflammation In SLE, autoantibodies and antibody-immune complexes are produced that eventually cause damage to body tissues and induce inflammation [ [3](#B3-life-13-01589), [4](#B4-life-13-01589)]. SLE patients experience relapsing and remission courses [ [5](#B5-life-13-01589)]. In SLE, various organs can be involved, including the skin, kidneys, joints, heart, lungs, liver, and blood vessels [ [6](#B6-life-13-01589), [7](#B7-life-13-01589)]. Since different organs are involved in SLE, a variety of indices can be used to assess the status of diseases, such as the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA), or British index [ [8](#B8-life-13-01589)]. [9](#B9-life-13-01589), [10](#B10-life-13-01589)]. [6](#B6-life-13-01589), [11](#B11-life-13-01589)]. The mentioned medications lead patients to be exposed to side effects and also reduce the patient's quality of life [ [12](#B12-life-13-01589)]. This encourages patients to try complementary and alternative medicines such as herbal remedies, medicinal plants, phytochemicals, vitamins and mineral supplements, acupuncture, moxibustion, and spiritual therapy such as yoga. Moreover, tremendous efforts have been made by researchers to develop safe and efficient drugs and supplements from natural molecules and their synthetic derivatives for the condition. [13](#B13-life-13-01589), [14](#B14-life-13-01589), [15](#B15-life-13-01589), [16](#B16-life-13-01589), [17](#B17-life-13-01589), [18](#B18-life-13-01589)]. Some other review articles discussing natural products on a specific condition of lupus, such as cutaneous lupus [ [19](#B19-life-13-01589)] or lupus nephritis [ [20](#B20-life-13-01589)], can be found in the literature. Some discussed only a specific natural compound such as curcumin [ [21](#B21-life-13-01589)], omega-3 fatty acids [ [22](#B22-life-13-01589)], and triptolide [ [23](#B23-life-13-01589)]. On the other hand, some other review articles reflected a specific traditional medicine approach such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), traditional Iranian medicine (TIM) [ [24](#B24-life-13-01589)], or Ayurveda [ [25](#B25-life-13-01589)], which mostly focused on polyherbal formulations and plant extracts that are composed of a complex mixture of phytochemicals with a holistic approach. Some of these articles have neglected minerals, vitamins, and pure active phytoconstituents. Conversely, some reviews and meta-analyses specifically focused on fatty acids [ [22](#B22-life-13-01589), [26](#B26-life-13-01589), [27](#B27-life-13-01589)] or vitamins [ [28](#B28-life-13-01589), [29](#B29-life-13-01589)]. Moreover, some articles focused mostly on pharmacology and possible mechanisms of action of a group of natural components without scoping clinical trials or meta-analyses [ [30](#B30-life-13-01589)]. All the mentioned articles provided precious information for specific groups of researchers and highlighted specific aspects of treatment and drug development for lupus conditions. But a comprehensive systematic review that simultaneously gives detailed evidence-based information on the efficacy of natural products and supplements on different lupus conditions, which helps practitioners and clinicians to understand the mechanism of action and the level of evidence for any of these molecules, herbs, or supplements and researchers to design new goal-oriented experimental studies or clinical trials, seems to be lacking. The present article tries to cover the last-mentioned points in this paragraph and reviewed natural molecules, phytochemicals, medicinal plants, fungi, vitamins, minerals, and other supplements that have been reported to be beneficial for lupus conditions, with special emphasis on clinical trials and the molecules' mechanism of actions, as well as their adverse effects and toxicity. 2. Materials and Methods 3. Results 3.1. Ethnobotany [31](#B31-life-13-01589), [32](#B32-life-13-01589)]. Traditional knowledge on how to deal with this condition involves the use of several medicinal plants or plant-based mixtures. Ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological studies reveal that acidissima bark [ [34](#B34-life-13-01589)] have dermatologic in the treatment of lupus erythematosus. Also, documented to treat systemic lupus erythematosus. According to Iranian traditional medicine (traditional Persian medicine), infectious diseases and fever are the main reasons for nephritis, which is called \"Varam-e-Kolye\". Several medicinal plants have been advised to control for lupus nephritis or \"Varam-e-Kolye\", Prunus Mill. Some recent research reported nephroprotective and anti-inflammatory of these [39](#B39-life-13-01589)] are other plants advised for Varam-e-Kolye and/or other kidney diseases such as \"Riah-e-Gorde\" [ [41](#B41-life-13-01589), [42](#B42-life-13-01589)]. Carvia () is the Arabic version of the Latin word \"craviya\" or the Syriac word \"Ceravi\"; in Greek the word is \"Azhamyon\", in Roman \"Fadroni\", and in Arabic \"Taghdeh\", \"Taghrad\", [44](#B44-life-13-01589), [45](#B45-life-13-01589)]. [Table 1](#life-13-01589-t001). 3.2. Purified Molecules from Natural Sources [90](#B90-life-13-01589)]. On the other hand, the absence of a well-organized regulatory and legal framework for herbal products has caused the World Health Organization (WHO) to express worry regarding the efficacy and safety of herbal treatments [ [91](#B91-life-13-01589)]. Due to varying growth circumstances and harvesting times, different primary and secondary metabolites have varying concentrations in medicinal plants [ [92](#B92-life-13-01589)]. These problems motivate researchers to find and purify the medicinal plant's active components. Researchers have gained a greater understanding of the mechanisms of action by working with highly purified compounds. When compared to herbal extracts, pure natural molecules are more reliable at determining dosage and detecting unwanted effects or potential toxicities. Moreover, natural molecules can be considered lead compounds for developing new drugs. In the case of lupus, several natural products and their derivatives, in purified and structure-elucidated form, have been reported to exhibit considerable therapeutic potential. Although the mechanisms of action of some of these molecules have yet to be fully elucidated, more extensive research can generate new data that can be used in clinical trials. The reported data on these molecules is discussed in detail in the following ( [Table with such as dihydroartemisinin, artemether, and arteether, artesunate have been developed and investigated in several research works [ [140](#B140-life-13-01589), [141](#B141-life-13-01589)]. [142](#B142-life-13-01589)]. Like some other conventional anti-malarial drugs, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, artemisinin derivatives are assumed to have beneficial therapeutic effects on SLE [ [143](#B143-life-13-01589), [144](#B144-life-13-01589)]. But in contrast to chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which have serious side effects in some cases, no significant side effects have been associated with artemisinin except for mild side effects such as nausea and vomiting or diarrhea [ [145](#B145-life-13-01589)]. [144](#B144-life-13-01589)]. Artesunate increases CD3 and CD4 and increases the CD4/CD8 T lymphocytes ratio. It can regulate the immune function by increasing IL-2 activity and decreasing the level of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) [ [144](#B144-life-13-01589)]. [142](#B142-life-13-01589)]. Following the use of artemisinin, such as TNF-, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, inhibited, but the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10 is increased [ [146](#B146-life-13-01589)]. [147](#B147-life-13-01589)]. [148](#B148-life-13-01589)]. Dihydroartemisinin can also restore balance in Treg/Th17 by inducing Foxp3 expression in T cells in mice model [ [106](#B106-life-13-01589)]. Therefore, dihydroartemisinin is assumed to be effective in improving the condition of SLE patients [ [148](#B148-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity and Side Effects [149](#B149-life-13-01589)]. This topic is still open for further research [ [150](#B150-life-13-01589)]. 3.2.2. Antroquinonol [151](#B151-life-13-01589), [152](#B152-life-13-01589)]. A. camphorata is a mushroom that grows in the inner cavity of the Cinnamomum kanehirai (Lauraceae) tree [ [153](#B153-life-13-01589)] and produces some antroquinonol drivatives, including antroquinonol, antroquinonol B, C, D, L, and M, and 4-acetyantroquinonol B [ [154](#B154-life-13-01589)]. Hocena is an antroquinonol capsule intended for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer and has an orphan drug status from the US Food and Drug Administration [ [155](#B155-life-13-01589)]. Antroquinonol has been claimed to have the potential to prevent renal disorders and the worsening of lupus nephritis [ [156](#B156-life-13-01589)]. Inhibiting T cell activation and proliferation, lowering free radical and nitric oxide production, enhancing Nrf2 activation, and decreasing inflammation by inhibiting NF-kB function in the kidney are some of the proposed involved mechanisms [ [93](#B93-life-13-01589), [156](#B156-life-13-01589)]. [93](#B93-life-13-01589)]. In another study, antroquinonol reduced proteinuria and lowered creatinine and serum BUN levels. It also reduces the thickness of the kidney glomerular basement membrane and inhibits the production of TNF- and IL-1. Therefore, the use of A. camphorata in autoimmune diseases such as SLE can protect the kidneys [ [46](#B46-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity and Side Effects [157](#B157-life-13-01589)]. Although antroquinonol exhibits cytotoxic ranging from 0.13 to 6.09 M it is considered safe [ [158](#B158-life-13-01589)]. Antroquinonol dosages below 30 mg/kg/day do not appear to be associated with any adverse effects [ [159](#B159-life-13-01589)]. Overall, A. camphorata has revealed very little toxicity or side effects in clinical practice. 3.2.3. Baicalin [99](#B99-life-13-01589)]. Baicalin in MRL/lpr lupus-prone mice has been shown to reduce anti-ds-DNA antibody and urine protein levels. Baicalin has been able to inhibit mTOR activation and also reduce mTOR agonist-mediated Tfh cell expansion and increase Tfr cells. This molecule can inhibit IL-21 production, Tfh cell differentiation, and Foxp3+ regulatory T cell differentiation [ [98](#B98-life-13-01589)]. In a study on pristane-induced lupus in BALB/c mice, baicalin reduced such as TNF-, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-. It inhibited the overproduction of IL-6 and PGE2 and downregulated the aberrant activation of T cells. Thus, it was concluded that baicalin can reduce the severity of SLE and attenuate autoimmunity [ [99](#B99-life-13-01589), [160](#B160-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity and Side Effects [161](#B161-life-13-01589)]. Some data about possible nephrotoxicity of high doses of baicalin are published, but as a whole, the safety and toxicity of this compound remain still insufficiently studied [ [162](#B162-life-13-01589)]. Various drug transporters and metabolic enzymes are involved in the disposition of baicalin, and they may be influenced or reciprocally influenced by co-administered medications. These factors can justify the wide herb-drug interactions between baicalin and chemical drugs. Baicalin can significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of medications that have a high protein binding affinity or share the same cytochrome be mentioned can interfere with baicalin [ [163](#B163-life-13-01589)]. 3.2.4. Curcumin [21](#B21-life-13-01589)]. A variety of clinical trials assessing the curcumin effect on inflammation, skin, eye, CNS, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, and metabolic disorders have been reported so far [ [164](#B164-life-13-01589)]. Since curcumin has shown immunomodulatory properties, it has been considered for the improvement of SLE patients. The recommended dosage for SLE ranges from 100-200 mg daily to 4.5 g/day [ [165](#B165-life-13-01589)]. Curcumin is found to have protective effects against aluminum toxicity and cisplatin-associated neurotoxicity and neuropathy [ [166](#B166-life-13-01589), has been found that curcumin can inhibit the maturation and function of dendritic cells. This function of curcumin is achieved through reducing the expression of MHC-II and and CD256. be due to the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines such as general, curcumin can keep dendritic cells in an immature state, and as a result, it suppresses dendritic cell-mediated stimulation of inflammatory T cells, which play a key role in the severity of symptoms observed in SLE [ [21](#B21-life-13-01589)]. In Vivo and In Vitro Studies [100](#B100-life-13-01589)]. [101](#B101-life-13-01589)]. In another study, the ability of oral curcumin consumption to attenuate autoimmunity and renal injury during SLE was evaluated. In order to do this, the female NZBWF1 was given 500 mg/kg/day of curcumin through an oral gavage for 14 days. Finally, it was found that following the consumption of curcumin, weight and body composition were maintained and a decrease in spleen weight and renal injury (glomerulosclerosis) were observed compared to the control group. Ultimately, it has been determined that curcumin can modulate autoimmune activity and probably reduce renal injury in female mice with SLE [ [102](#B102-life-13-01589)]. [103](#B103-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity and Side Effects [174](#B174-life-13-01589)]. Despite its well-known safety, several unfavorable side effects have been documented. In a dose-response investigation, seven patients who received 500-12,000 mg and were monitored for 72 h reported symptoms including diarrhea, headache, rash, and yellow stools [ [175](#B175-life-13-01589)]. In a different study, some participants who received 0.45 to 3.6 g of curcumin per day for one to four months experienced diarrhea, nausea, and a rise in the levels of the enzymes lactate dehydrogenase and of emodin is Rheum palmatum (Polygonaceae) which is also known as rhubarb. [178](#B178-life-13-01589)]. [107](#B107-life-13-01589)]. [108](#B108-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity and Side Effects [179](#B179-life-13-01589)]. Generally, it is also known to have kidney toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity, especially at high doses and long-term use [ [180](#B180-life-13-01589)] The extremely low bioavailability of emodin further limits its use in therapeutic applications [ [179](#B179-life-13-01589)]. 3.2.6. Esculetin [109](#B109-life-13-01589)]. Lupus nephritis is one of the important complications of lupus, and complement activation contributes to kidney injury; the inhibition of complement activation by herbal compounds might be beneficial for lupus. It was also reported that the coumarin derivates that are isolated from H. paniculata could improve renal injuries in cationized-BSA-induced membranous nephropathy. The suggested mechanism was the inhibition of complement activation and interleukin 10-mediated interstitial fibrosis [ and anti-asthma [ [184](#B184-life-13-01589)]. According to certain research, its renal protective actions may be beneficial for those with lupus nephritis [ [166](#B166-life-13-01589), [167](#B167-life-13-01589)]. [113](#B113-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity and Side Effects [185](#B185-life-13-01589)]. Mangiferin was found to be safe and helpful in enhancing cellular function, according to numerous research works [ [186](#B186-life-13-01589)]. In a study that assessed the toxicity of mango leaf extract, which was given orally to rats for three months at a dose of 2 g/kg body weight per day, neither mortality nor toxic effects were observed [ [187](#B187-life-13-01589)]. The Mangifera indica leaf aqueous extract was not particularly mutagenic or genotoxic. Mangiferin has generally been shown to be safe in cell and animal research. In contrast, there are insufficient safety data from human research [ [186](#B186-life-13-01589)]. 3.2.8. Salvianolic Acid A [188](#B188-life-13-01589)]. [114](#B114-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity and Side Effects [189](#B189-life-13-01589)]. According to a system review of the drug's safety, the clinical use of salvianolate injection did not result in the occurrence of any common or major side effects. Blood loss and allergic reactions are the most common adverse effects of salvianolic acid injections. In general, it has been determined that salvianolic acid is well tolerated in the general population. Rash, erythemas, pruritus, palpitations, headaches, dizziness, elevated blood bilirubin, elevated transaminases, elevated blood creatinine, positive fecal occult blood, and abnormal platelet count are among the most common adverse effects that were reported for salvianolic acids [ [190](#B190-life-13-01589)]. 3.2.9. Triptolide [23](#B23-life-13-01589), [139](#B139-life-13-01589)]. Despite the beneficial effects of Triptolide in the treatment of various inflammatory disorders, it should be noted that the use of T. wilfordii can cause severe toxicity and side effects. This may limit the clinical use of this plant [ [191](#B191-life-13-01589)]. Triptolide's anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects are due to its ability to inhibit the proliferation of immune cells and inflammation-related cells and reduce cytokines and proinflammatory mediators [ [192](#B192-life-13-01589)]. [124](#B124-life-13-01589)]. Triptolide has been shown to reduce the expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) [ [193](#B193-life-13-01589)]. It can also reduce the expression of C3 and CD40, so it generally has immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects and is useful in renal disorders [ [194](#B194-life-13-01589)]. Another way triptolide can be immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory is through changing signaling pathways. Triptolide has been reported to inhibit nuclear factor-B (NF-B) signaling pathway [ [195](#B195-life-13-01589)], lower the IL-17 level, and suppress IL-6/signal transducer and transcription 3 pathway [ [196](#B196-life-13-01589)]. LLDT-8 improves anti-GBM glomerulonephritis because it can regulate Fc signaling pathway [ [197](#B197-life-13-01589)]. It can also improve lupus nephritis and reduce the infiltration of kidney immune cells because it inhibits the expression of renal chemokines [ [125](#B125-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity and Side Effects [198](#B198-life-13-01589)]. Hepatic cytochrome P450s are involved in the metabolism of triptolide, and triptolide toxicity and CPY3A also have a close relationship. Clinical case reports have shown through research that triptolide exposure can be involved in damaging a variety of organs, including the kidney, liver, heart, ovary, and testicles. Additionally, it has been shown that triptolide has a variety of harmful effects on cells, including damage to membranes, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, beneficial effects of TGP on lupus patients are dependent on its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects [ [201](#B201-life-13-01589)]. The effects of TGP on the production of proinflammatory cytokines, antibody production, apoptosis of lymphocytes, and lymphocyte proliferation are dual and dose-dependent [ [202](#B202-life-13-01589)]. TGP increased the mouse splenocytes' proliferation at low doses (0.05~0.4 mg/L), while it decreased it at high doses (0.4~1.6 mg/L) [ [202](#B202-life-13-01589), [203](#B203-life-13-01589), [204](#B204-life-13-01589)]. The ratio of T helper cells to T suppressor cells (Th/Ts) increases at low doses of TGP (0.2 mg/L) and decreases at high doses of TGP (6.0 mg/L) [ [204](#B204-life-13-01589)]. IL-1 production increases at low doses of TGP (0.5~12.5 mg/L) and decreases at high doses of TGP (12.5~312.5 mg/L) [ [203](#B203-life-13-01589)]. IgM-antibody production increases at low doses of TGP (0.1~0.4 mg/L) and decreases at high doses of TGP (0.4~3.2 mg/L) [ [205](#B205-life-13-01589), [206](#B206-life-13-01589)]. Therefore, it is assumed that the immunomodulatory effects of TGP are dose-dependent, and the dose should be adjusted for best results. [202](#B202-life-13-01589)]. TGP reduces the SLEDAI score in SLE patients and also reduces the average daily dose of prednisolone [ [115](#B115-life-13-01589)]. A decrease in renal pathology has been observed following the consumption of TGP by MRL/lpr mice. TGP has also reduced the levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies and antinuclear antibodies (ANA). It could also reduce urinary protein levels. Consequently, it was concluded that TGP consumption in patients with lupus nephritis can have therapeutic effects [ [119](#B119-life-13-01589)]. TGP causes down-regulated Foxp3 promoter methylation levels, thus increasing expression of Foxp3 in lupus CD4+ T cells. TGP increased the number and percentage of Treg cells in lupus CD4+ T cells and increased IFN- and IL-2 expression [ [200](#B200-life-13-01589)]. TGP increases DNA methylation of ITGAL promoter in CD4+ T cells, thereby reducing CD11a gene expression [ [120](#B120-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity and Side Effects [207](#B207-life-13-01589)]. 3.3. Fatty Acids, Vitamins, and Minerals [208](#B208-life-13-01589)]. The efficacy of some of them have been investigated and discussed in several studies ( [Table 2](#life-13-01589-t002)). Safety and side effects of fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals is well studied by numerous publications and are available even on the indications of these over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. 3.3.1. Fatty Acids [209](#B209-life-13-01589)]. Dietary lipids are also involved in autoimmune phenomena by affecting the balance between Th1 and Th2 cells [ [210](#B210-life-13-01589), [211](#B211-life-13-01589)]. [212](#B212-life-13-01589)]. -linolenic acid and -linolenic acid are among the omega-3 acids that have beneficial effects following the reduction of TNF- and IL-2 in SLE patients. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation has shown potential benefit on SLE disease activity as demonstrated by Systemic Lupus Activity Measure-Revised (SLAM-R), SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), and British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) scores as well as plasma membrane arachidonic acid composition and urinary 8-isoprostane levels, with minimal adverse effects [ [213](#B213-life-13-01589)]. [214](#B214-life-13-01589)]. Wei et al. concluded in a meta-analysis PUFA supplementation could but not CRP concentrations [ [215](#B215-life-13-01589)]. [212](#B212-life-13-01589)]. Studies have shown that the lifespan increased and autoantibody levels decreased in animal models of SLE following a diet rich in omega-3 The most widely available dietary source of EPA and DHA is cold-water oily fish, such as salmon, herring, mackerel, B Following the use of niacin, a decrease in triglyceride and LDL-C levels was observed, with no significant effect on HDL-C levels [ [130](#B130-life-13-01589)]. In general, it was suggested that taking supplements of the vitamin B complex could be beneficial for people with SLE. 3.3.4. Vitamin C [131](#B131-life-13-01589)]. Concomitant use of 500 mg of vitamin C and 800 mg of vitamin E daily for 3 months has shown a slight decrease in lipid peroxidation. In SLE patients with high doses of vitamin C, ascorbate is found in the urine, so the maximum dose of vitamin C is 1000 mg/day [ [220](#B220-life-13-01589)]. 3.3.5. Vitamin D [132](#B132-life-13-01589)]. Calcitriol is the active form of vitamin D and acts on autoimmune diseases such as SLE by regulating the response of T and B cells and boosting the innate immune response [ [133](#B133-life-13-01589)]. SLE patients are photosensitive and should use sunscreen when exposed to the sun. On the other hand, sunlight is needed to produce vitamin D, so it can be assumed that taking vitamin D supplements might be useful for SLE patients [ [221](#B221-life-13-01589), [222](#B222-life-13-01589)]. 3.3.6. Selenium an in vitro study performed on the B6.Sle1b mouse model of lupus, an attempt was made to find the mechanism of the effect of selenium on lupus. It has been shown that selenium can inhibit the activation, differentiation, and maturation of macrophages and B cells. Therefore, its use can be useful in patients with lupus [ [137](#B137-life-13-01589)]. Reduced selenium levels have been observed in patients with autoimmune diseases, which may be considered a risk factor for the onset of autoimmunity and inflammation. Due to the anti-inflammatory effect of selenium, it has been suggested that consuming a certain amount of selenium in patients with autoimmune diseases can lead to better management of disease complications [ [225](#B225-life-13-01589)]. 3.3.10. Zinc [226](#B226-life-13-01589)]. A study of NZB/NZW mice showed a decrease in autoantibody production. In MRL/lpr mice, the use of zinc-restricted diets decreased the level of anti-dsDNA, decreased lymphoproliferation, and recovered glomerulonephritis [ [210](#B210-life-13-01589)]. On the other hand, it should be noted that a study conducted on humans has shown that zinc deficiency causes immune dysfunction by acting on Th cells and can lead to neurosensory disorders and reduced body mass [ [227](#B227-life-13-01589)]. 3.4. Herbal Medicines, Medicinal Plants, Mushrooms, and Fungi and Their Crude Extracts [Table 3](#life-13-01589-t003)). In some traditional remedies, they have been used in the form of dried powdered plant material or fungi. In some others, a crude extract of the plant or fungus was prepared using solvents such as water or ethanol or a mixture of both (hydroalcoholic extract). Crude extracts are a complex mixture of molecules with the same range of polarity but different concentrations. Sometimes, several molecules with a variety of mechanisms work synergistically to produce a specific effect. Although the crude extracts of herbal medicine can reflect the efficacy of a special herb or fungi, due to the variation of compounds in the natural sources, special attention should be given to the standardization and authentication of them in order to have repeatable and reliable effects. Compared to purified bioactive molecules, crude extracts usually exhibit milder efficacy and side effects, and introducing supplements from herbal medicine to the market is much easier. 3.4.1. Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. F. [88](#B88-life-13-01589), [253](#B253-life-13-01589)]. Its root extract is used, but its bark must be removed because of its toxicity. There are various compounds with a range of biological effects in the root extract, and the procedures and methods of extraction play a role in overcoming the plants' toxicity [ [254](#B254-life-13-01589), [255](#B255-life-13-01589)]. In TCM, the T. wilfordii preparations have long been used for some health conditions, including sores and swelling, inflammations, ankylosing spondylitis, hepatitis, nephropathy, allergic skin diseases, inflammatory lesions of leprosy, and cancer [ [253](#B253-life-13-01589), [254](#B254-life-13-01589), [256](#B256-life-13-01589), [257](#B257-life-13-01589), [258](#B258-life-13-01589), [259](#B259-life-13-01589)]. The effect of T. wilfordii on autoimmune diseases such as SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), BehCet's disease, psoriasis, etc., has been investigated in several studies [ [253](#B253-life-13-01589), [260](#B260-life-13-01589)]. Its effect on kidney transplantation, nephrotic syndrome, and diabetic nephropathy has also been investigated [ [261](#B261-life-13-01589), [262](#B262-life-13-01589), [263](#B263-life-13-01589)]. Clinical Trials [249](#B249-life-13-01589)]. The immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of T. wilfordii have also been reported in a clinical study on 26 DLE cases [ [250](#B250-life-13-01589)]. [249](#B249-life-13-01589), [250](#B250-life-13-01589)] One of the side effects reported due to long-term use of T. wilfordii in women is decreased bone mineral density [ [121](#B121-life-13-01589)]. Due to some toxic side effects of T. wilfordii such as kidney damage, its use is not recommended in SLE patients who also have nephropathy [ [249](#B249-life-13-01589)]. A systematic review has discussed cardiovascular, hematologic, and skin complications as well as infertility and gastrointestinal complications of this plant [ [122](#B122-life-13-01589)]). Side effects are more common with high concentrations. Consuming the right amounts and rational treatment will help control the side effects and obtain therapeutic effects [ [121](#B121-life-13-01589)]. Active Compounds and Possible Mechanisms of Efficacy [123](#B123-life-13-01589)]. Among the phytochemicals of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects are mediated by of T cells and inhibition of IL-17 and STAT3 transcription [ [125](#B125-life-13-01589)]. It has been observed that NF-B activity is significantly reduced in patients with SLE after consuming T. wilfordii. It was suggested that T. wilfordii may exert an immunosuppressive effect on SLE patients by inhibiting NF-B expression [ [123](#B123-life-13-01589)]. [121](#B121-life-13-01589)]. In another study, to evaluate the effect of triptolide, BALB/c-un nude mice were used. Mice were treated orally with 5 mg/kg/d of triptolide, and their blood samples were collected before treatment and 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. Finally, it was found that with the use of triptolide, a decrease in the percentage of CD8+, Tcl, Thl cells, CD4+/CD8+, Thl/Th2, and Tcl/Tc2 and an increase in the percentage of CD4+, Tc2, and Th2 cells was observed [ A meta-analysis study was conducted on a total of 14 studies comprising 1301 participants, which were combined for analysis in the present study. In general, this study showed that consumption of O. sinensis mycelium (Bailing capsule) for lupus nephritis is more effective than not using it. Although there was no significant difference between the Bailing group and the control group in anti-ds-DNAIgM levels and complement C3 levels (which is associated with the existence of some immune diseases like SLE), other indicators of the disease, such as SLEDAI score, Alb, 24 h urinary protein, serum creatinine, and the number of effective treatments and complications, improved. It was concluded that O. sinensis could be beneficial in the treatment of lupus nephritis [ [142](#B142-life-13-01589)]. [95](#B95-life-13-01589)]. Active Compounds and Possible Mechanisms of Efficacy [265](#B265-life-13-01589)]. Intracellular polysaccharides isolated from submerged cultures of O. sinensis have been reported to exhibit strong immunomodulatory effects on RAW264.7 macrophage cells via the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. It enhanced the phagocytic activity of RAW264.7 cells and increased cytokine production. This immunomodulatory response was mediated by the secretion both substances (TGF-1 IL-10), producing NO and promoting the expression of iNOS [ [266](#B266-life-13-01589)]. [265](#B265-life-13-01589)]. Deoxynucleic acids from O. sinensis bone DCs via a toll-like receptor 9-dependent pathway [ [265](#B265-life-13-01589)]. Aside from the total extracts of O. sinensis, specific components, including 1-(5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furyl)--carboline, and cordymin (a purified peptide from O. [268](#B268-life-13-01589), cardiovascular [ and kidney protective [ [272](#B272-life-13-01589)] properties of O. sinensis may also have a role in the beneficial effects of this fungus on SLE. [242](#B242-life-13-01589)]. In another study on MRL lpr/lpr mice, a triterpenoid, component H1-A, was extracted from C. sinensis. Administration of 40 \u00b5g/kg/d of H1-A daily for 8 weeks to mice aged 12 weeks resulted in a reduction in the production of anti-dsDNA, lymphadenopathy, and proteinuria. Renal function has improved, and no significant changes have been observed in immune complex deposition. In general, H1-A intake has increased the survival of mice with lupus [ [96](#B96-life-13-01589)]. [243](#B243-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity [278](#B278-life-13-01589)], cancers [ [279](#B279-life-13-01589)], cardiovascular risk factors of metabolic syndrome [ [280](#B280-life-13-01589)], lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) [ [281](#B281-life-13-01589)], etc. Moreover, in a clinical trial, -glucans of G. lucidum were reported as safe and well-tolerated immunomodulator supplements for children [ [282](#B282-life-13-01589)]. Active Compounds and Possible Mechanisms of Efficacy [283](#B283-life-13-01589), [284](#B284-life-13-01589)]. G. lucidum polysaccharides (GLPs), such as ganoderan and -glucans, have been extensively studied for their biological activities, which include antioxidant, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetes, and immunomodulatory properties [ different immune effector cells, including lymphocytes and myeloid cells. They can modulate innate immunity, cellular immunity, and humoral immunity [ [286](#B286-life-13-01589)]. Also, some triterpenoids of G. lucidum (GLTs), such as ganosidone A and its derivatives [ [287](#B287-life-13-01589)], as well as ganoderic acid D [ [288](#B288-life-13-01589)], and 3-oxo-5 -lanosta-8, [289](#B289-life-13-01589)] have effects. [236](#B236-life-13-01589)]. [237](#B237-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity and Side Effects [290](#B290-life-13-01589)]. In a study, it has been determined that sub-chronic toxicity of the liver occurs when rats are given more than 1.2 mg/kg body weight of G. lucidum extract [ Dioica L. [292](#B292-life-13-01589), [293](#B293-life-13-01589)]. Clinical Trials Compounds and Possible Mechanisms of Efficacy [294](#B294-life-13-01589), [295](#B295-life-13-01589)]. Moreover, several plant sterols, such as sitosterol and its derivatives, have also been reported from the nettle root extract [ [296](#B296-life-13-01589)]. The root and leave extracts of U. dioica have shown immunomodulatory effects through different mechanisms, including lowering thromboxane production in human platelets and inhibiting the 12-LOX pathway. Different parts of the plant have shown antioxidant effects [ [294](#B294-life-13-01589), [297](#B297-life-13-01589)]. [94](#B94-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity and Side [300](#B300-life-13-01589)]. The toxicity and safety profile of N. nucifera and its components have been examined in several research. A number of in vitro studies have been conducted to evaluate the toxicity of N. nucifera using normal cell lines. N. nucifera has not been found to significantly affect cell viability or to have any toxic effects, according to the findings of a number of in vitro investigations. The safety profile of N. nucifera has also been examined in numerous in vivo studies. In general, side effects from in vivo investigations include an increase in lymphocytes, a decrease in basophils, and a drop in creatinine, and hematocrit [ [301](#B301-life-13-01589)]. 3.4.6. Artemisia annua Pall. [302](#B302-life-13-01589)]. Recently, the possibility of A. annua being useful in the treatment of COVID-19 has been investigated and satisfactory results have been reported [ [303](#B303-life-13-01589), [304](#B304-life-13-01589), [305](#B305-life-13-01589)]. Clinical Trial [306](#B306-life-13-01589)]. [307](#B307-life-13-01589), [308](#B308-life-13-01589)]. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone in glandular hairs on the leaves and flowers of A. annua, is one of the important components of this plant, which is assumed to be one of the potential compounds against lupus. Apart from A. annua, other plants containing artemisinin, such as Artemisia apiacea, can also be effective in treating lupus [ [309](#B309-life-13-01589)]. [140](#B140-life-13-01589), [302](#B302-life-13-01589)]. The effects of dihydroarteannuin (also known as dihydroqinghaosu, artenimol, or DHA) is one of the semi-synthetic derivatives of artemisinin. In a study, the effect of dihydroarteannuin and its mechanism on lupus in BXSB mice has been investigated. In this study, male BXSB mice were given dihydroarteannuin daily for ten days. One group was considered a control and the other three groups were given doses of 5 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, or 125 mg/kg. As a result, dihydroarteannuin consumption was found to reduce TNF-alpha production, as well as nuclear factor-B (NF-B) activation and p65 subunit expression. Dihydroarteannuin inhibits NF-B translocation to the nucleus and also inhibits IB- protein degradation [ [104](#B104-life-13-01589)]. In general, the level of TNF-alpha in the serum of SLE patients is higher than normal people. In addition, the expression of TNF-alpha receptors in peripheral blood lymphocytes of SLE patients is higher. NF-B is a transcription factor located in the inactive cytoplasmic complex. It has two subunits, p50 and p65, and is attached to the IB family, which are inhibitory proteins. Stimulation separates NF-B from IB and eventually translocates NF-B to the nucleus, where it binds to DNA, inducing the expression of genes involved in the pathology of SLE progression [ [104](#B104-life-13-01589)]. [228](#B228-life-13-01589)]. [97](#B97-life-13-01589)]. [105](#B105-life-13-01589)]. [106](#B106-life-13-01589)]. There is also further evidence and studies to investigate the effect of A. annua on lupus [ [310](#B310-life-13-01589), [311](#B311-life-13-01589), [312](#B312-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity Clinical Trials [240](#B240-life-13-01589)]. Action [313](#B313-life-13-01589), contains polysaccharides with immunomodulatory properties such as FP-1. In a study, this polysaccharide stimulated immune responses by inducing mRNA expression of TNF-, and immunomodulatory properties [ [319](#B319-life-13-01589), [320](#B320-life-13-01589)]. Flaxseed -sitosterol, and 5-avenasterol These repeatedly reported as anti-inflammatory agents [ [322](#B322-life-13-01589)]. Adding flaxseed oil to the 3T3-L1 264.7 macrophages, showed a dose-dependent shift in cytokines toward IL-4 but a decrease in TNF-. In the in vivo model (C57bl/6 mice), oral flaxseed oil (4 weeks) increased IgE levels. Anti-ova also reduced Some polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), such as -linolenic acid, have a variety of biological activities including neural stem cell proliferative, anti-atherosclerotic, and anti-inflammatory effects [ [209](#B209-life-13-01589), [215](#B215-life-13-01589), [323](#B323-life-13-01589)]. They might exhibit cardiovascular protective properties and might be useful in preventing the progression of nephritis in patients with lupus [ [240](#B240-life-13-01589)]. The beneficial effect of flaxseed on the kidneys has been reported in a number of studies [ [324](#B324-life-13-01589), [325](#B325-life-13-01589), [302](#B302-life-13-01589), [329](#B329-life-13-01589)]. Clinical Trial [246](#B246-life-13-01589)]. A similar clinical trial was performed for patients with lupus nephritis, and it can be said that similar results were seen in general [ [330](#B330-life-13-01589)]. Phytochemicals and Possible Mechanisms of Action [247](#B247-life-13-01589)]. [331](#B331-life-13-01589)]. The polysaccharides of this plant have been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity through suppression of IL-6 and TGF production on bacterial LPS-induced macrophages. [332](#B332-life-13-01589)]. Two other polysaccharides, including SDH-WA and SDH-0.2A, have also been reported to have immunomodulatory properties. They increased lysozyme activity and TNF- and IL-6 production by RAW264.7 cells. They did, however, the secretion of IL-6, synthase expression. and IL-1 secretion. Moreover, catalpol downregulated the NF-B signaling pathway, suppressed the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and lowered LPS-induced generation of ROS [ [334](#B334-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity Side 3.4.9. Paeonia \u00d7 suffruticosa Andrews [336](#B336-life-13-01589)]. The root bark of this plant has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for lupus nephritis [ [337](#B337-life-13-01589)]. Clinical Trials [245](#B245-life-13-01589)]. Possible Mechanisms of Action [244](#B244-life-13-01589)]. [118](#B118-life-13-01589)]. In another study, following the consumption of TGP by MRL/lpr mice, the urinary protein content and the levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) decreased [ [119](#B119-life-13-01589)]. [120](#B120-life-13-01589)]. [201](#B201-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity and Side Effects [340](#B340-life-13-01589)]. In the section of this article on purified molecules from natural sources, the side effects of this plant and TGP compound have been discussed. 3.4.11. Scutellaria baicalensis of S. baicalensis and its anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antioxidant effects have been studied [ [99](#B99-life-13-01589)]. Phytochemicals and Possible Mechanisms of Action [248](#B248-life-13-01589)]. used in to treat inflammation and pain and systemic lupus erythematosus [ [239](#B239-life-13-01589)]. Clinical Trial [238](#B238-life-13-01589)]. Animal G. glabra root contains glycyrrhizin and its derivatives, which are in the class of saponins [ [344](#B344-life-13-01589)]. G. glabra has long been used to treat a wide range of diseases. Studies have shown that it has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunostimulatory, anticoagulant, hepatoprotective, and anti-malarial effects [ [69](#B69-life-13-01589), Action [347](#B347-life-13-01589)]. [110](#B110-life-13-01589), [348](#B348-life-13-01589)]. Elevated HMGB1 levels have been shown to be associated with exacerbation of SLE and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-. The results of an animal study on female BALB/c mice that received glycyrrhizin (0.5 mg/day for two months) demonstrated that glycyrrhizin's inhibition of HMGB1 function caused a sharp decline in serum HMGB1 levels, which in turn decreased the severity of SLE [ [110](#B110-life-13-01589)]. Glycyrrhizin directly binds to HMGB1, reducing both the extracellular release of HMGB1 and its cytokine actions [ [46](#B46-life-13-01589)]. Antroquinonol was reported be the main active ingredient (refer to the antroquinonol section in this text). Toxicity and Side in lupus nephritis and its effects have been reviewed in articles. In a study, the effect of A. membranaceus and Tripterygium hypoglancum on SLE patients was investigated, and it was observed that NK activity decreased and therefore disease activity decreased [ [229](#B229-life-13-01589)]. A bioinformatics study has attempted to investigate the mechanism of the effect of A. membranaceus on lupus nephritis [ [352](#B352-life-13-01589)]. (Lam.) Oken [354](#B354-life-13-01589)]. The effect on SLE has been investigated. [230](#B230-life-13-01589), [231](#B231-life-13-01589)]. [232](#B232-life-13-01589)]. The effect of B. pinnatum on B cells has also been investigated in silico [ [355](#B355-life-13-01589), [356](#B356-life-13-01589)]. [233](#B233-life-13-01589)]. There is also further evidence and studies that investigate the effect of B. pinnatum on SLE and lupus nephritis [ [363](#B363-life-13-01589)]. The effect of C. sinensis on lupus has been studied. In an in silco study, the potency of green tea phytoconstituents as immunomodulators, anti-apoptosis agents, and anti-pyroptosis agents in SLE was investigated. The result of molecular docking can explain the mechanism of the active compound as anti-apoptosis and anti-pyroptosis. The docking results suggested theaflavin as one of the most active constituents [ [364](#B364-life-13-01589)]. Clinical Trial [234](#B234-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity and Side Effects [365](#B365-life-13-01589)]. 3.4.19. Curcuma longa L. [21](#B21-life-13-01589)]. It also has hepatoprotective effects and is useful in gastrointestinal disorders [ [366](#B366-life-13-01589)]. The effect of C. longa on lupus has been studied. One of the most active constituents is curcumin (see the section on curcumin in this text). Clinical Trials [235](#B235-life-13-01589)]. Toxicity and Side Effects 3.5. Other Plants with Lower Evidence for Lupus Conditions [367](#B367-life-13-01589), [368](#B368-life-13-01589)]. The plant and its phytoconstituents were applied to treat COVID-19 due to its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties asiaticoside, and madecassoside. It is mostly used to heal wounds, but it has also been used for skin conditions caused by lupus, leprosy, eczema, M. citrifolia has also be beneficial in treating lupus [ [379](#B379-life-13-01589), [380](#B380-life-13-01589)]. [381](#B381-life-13-01589)]. The combination of Corni Fructus with other plants of traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat lupus, although we could not find a study that has specifically examined the effect of Corni Fructus on SLE. It has been assumed that, owing to its anti-inflammatory and nephroprotective effects, it can be beneficial for patients with lupus. There are studies on the mechanism of its anti-inflammatory and kidney protective effect [ [382](#B382-life-13-01589), [383](#B383-life-13-01589), [384](#B384-life-13-01589)]. [385](#B385-life-13-01589)] A. sativum has also been suggested to be useful in improving lupus patients [ [386](#B386-life-13-01589)].

Some clinical trials have shown that EPO can be beneficial in improving some inflammatory conditions such as atopic eczema and atopic dermatitis. There are studies on the effect of EPO on arthritis [ [391](#B391-life-13-01589), [392](#B392-life-13-01589)]. Due to the presence of -linolenic acid and prostaglandin E1, its use can be effective in SLE patients. [393](#B393-life-13-01589)]. Immunomodulatory effects have been reported for the aqueous extract of A. paniculata leaves on rats [ [394](#B394-life-13-01589)]. [395](#B395-life-13-01589)]. [396](#B396-life-13-01589)]. Consumption of this plant could be effective in lupus patients due to its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects [ [30](#B30-life-13-01589)]. [397](#B397-life-13-01589)]. The major components of frankincense are boswellic acids, among which the most important and abundant is 3-O-acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid (AKBA). This compound is a strong inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase with anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic properties [ [398](#B398-life-13-01589)]. Another suggested mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of boswellic acid is potently inhibiting cathepsin G [ [399](#B399-life-13-01589)]. [397](#B397-life-13-01589), [400](#B400-life-13-01589), [401](#B401-life-13-01589)]. We could not find a clinical trial investigating the efficacy of frankincense on SLE, but due to its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, it might be poetically effective. [402](#B402-life-13-01589), [403](#B403-life-13-01589)] and has also been used to treat lupus [ [402](#B402-life-13-01589), [403](#B403-life-13-01589), [404](#B404-life-13-01589)]. [405](#B405-life-13-01589)]. Owing to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, it can be effective in treating SLE patients [ [30](#B30-life-13-01589), [406](#B406-life-13-01589)]. [407](#B407-life-13-01589), [408](#B408-life-13-01589)]. There is a case report that an SLE patient has ended up with acute renal failure following daily use of U. tomentosa [ [409](#B409-life-13-01589)]. [410](#B410-life-13-01589), [411](#B411-life-13-01589)]. Due to the presence of friedelin, lupeol, and betulinic acid, it has an immunomodulatory effect [ [30](#B30-life-13-01589)]. [412](#B412-life-13-01589)]. Its effectiveness in lupus has also been considered [ [413](#B413-life-13-01589)]. 4.
