Schedule here: https://bit.ly/3iZZzWJ Infrared light (experienced as heat) is the invisible part of the sun's spectrum with the ability to penetrate human tissue, providing a soothing, natural warmth. It is naturally occurring from the sun and is the basis for Sunlighten sauna therapy. One of the most compelling reasons to purchase a Sunlighten sauna is the natural pain relief associated with infrared sauna therapy. Sunlighten infrared sauna owners love to tell us about the pain relief properties of their sauna sessions. You too can toss the pain pills and step into one of our healing infrared sanctuaries to relieve tension and relax muscles. Sunlighten infrared sauna heat works by penetrating joints, muscles and tissues, increasing circulation and speeding oxygen flow. By reducing soreness on nerve endings, our infrared heat reduces muscle spasms and helps the body heal itself naturally. For years, doctors have recommended Sunlighten saunas because of proven relief from sports injury, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, arthritis and other chronic pain conditions. Infrared wavelengths penetrate the body to create heat, which creates profound therapeutic benefits. They increase blood flow to the muscles, delivering more concentrated oxygen, which creates more energy to heal. - Dr. Jeffrey Spencer - University of Southern California A 2013 study conducted at the Auburn University at Montgomery compared stretching in a Sunlighten mPulse 3-in-1 sauna compared to a typical training room environment. Participants completed a series of hamstring stretches in random order with 48 hours separating the sessions. Results showed that acute flexibility increased up to 3x in the mPulse sauna than without! Benefits to the increased range of motion include joint mobility, less friction in the joints, enabling of joint function to diminish stiffness and joint relaxation. "}
