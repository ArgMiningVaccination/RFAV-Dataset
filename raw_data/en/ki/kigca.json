Thursday, Sept. 14 8-10 a.m. Nutrition for Increasing Muscle Mass Dan Weinert, D.C., Ph.D. Muscle mass and strength are significant predictors of health and longevity. People typically experience a significant decline in muscle mass past the age of 40 which is largely due to a loss of fast-twitch muscle fiber size and number. This session reviews how mechanical tension and nutrition impact muscle protein synthesis. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is identified as a key player in skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Mechanical tension, insulin, cellular energy charge (ATP vs. AMP), and amino acid availability (especially leucine) are identified as key mTOR influencers. Participants will value the importance of muscle mass and better understand how to maintain/increase it to have a better health-span within a longer lifespan.

Vice President of Research at the New Zealand College of Chiropractic, Dr. Haavik is best known for her groundbreaking research on the impact of chiropractic adjustments of vertebral subluxations on the brain and central nervous system. What is becoming clear from scientific studies is that spinal dysfunction negatively impacts brain function. Dr. Haavik will explain the contemporary model of vertebral subluxation, according to published research articles. She has a gift for explaining this complex neuroscience research in easy-to-understand language. She will share with you a summary of where we are today with the neurophysiological understanding of the impact of spinal function on brain function and will discuss what future implications this has for us as a profession. 1-3 p.m. The Contemporary Understanding of The Neurophysiological Effects of The High-Velocity, Low-Amplitude Chiropractic Adjustment Heidi Haavik, BSc., Ph.D. is an award-winning chiropractor and Ph.D.-trained neurophysiologist who will cover, in a fun and entertaining way, the latest scientific understanding about how chiropractic HVLA adjustments can reverse maladaptive plastic brain changes that occur with spinal dysfunction. One particular part of the brain that we now know we impact when we adjust the spine is the prefrontal cortex. This is the chiropractor's dream because the prefrontal cortex is vital for one's intelligence, movement control, pain processing, mental health, immune system and inflammation (thus most chronic diseases)! Dr. Haavik will explain the contemporary understanding of the neurophysiological consequences of HVLA adjustments of subluxations. The complex neurophysiology will be presented in an easy to understand and clinically practical manner for students and D.C.s.

While MRI is the go-to answer for most soft tissue pathologies, diagnostic ultrasound is starting to become more utilized due to its cost effectiveness and the ability to perform dynamic evaluations which is not routinely performed with most other imaging modalities. The last hour will be discussing common calcifications and soft tissue findings that will often show up on X-rays when looking for spinal or extremities osseous pathologies. From costochondral cartilage calcifications through gallstones, phleboliths, and Monckeberg medial sclerosis, we will cover the more common and clinically significant soft tissue findings that can be encountered daily. Gonstead for the Non-Gonstead Chiropractor Dan Lyons, D.C., DPhCS Chiropractors, regardless of their chosen technique or system, have more commonalities than differences. The Gonstead system is a mindset, philosophy, and ideology that uses the tools common to the profession and available to all Doctors of Chiropractic to locate, analyze and correct vertebral subluxations. Attendees can expect to become better at knowing where, when, and how to adjust, even if they do not adjust using the Gonstead method. 3-4 p.m. Principles for Evaluation and Management of Amateur and Professional Athletes Casey Buns, D.C., CCSP \u00ae, CSCS This session highlights special emphasis on standards for working with golfers which can be applied to other sports with rotational or overhead athletic movements.
