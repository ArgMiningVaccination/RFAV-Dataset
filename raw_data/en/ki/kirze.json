The findings and certification of the superintendent shall be conclusive. (4) An approved special needs district may incur net indebtedness by the issuance of securities in accordance with the provisions of this chapter in an amount that does not exceed an amount equal to the greater of the following: (a) Twelve per cent of the sum of its tax valuation plus an amount that is the product of multiplying that tax valuation by the percentage by which the tax valuation has increased over the tax valuation on the first day of the sixtieth month preceding the month in which its board determines to submit to the electors the question of issuing the proposed securities; (b) Twelve per cent of the sum of its tax valuation plus an amount that is the product of multiplying that tax valuation by the percentage, determined by the superintendent of public instruction, by which that tax valuation is projected to increase during the next ten years.

If the board finds after receiving the report that the amount of money the district would spend on such installations, modifications, or remodeling is not likely to exceed the amount of money it would save in energy and resultant operational and maintenance costs over the ensuing fifteen years, the board may submit to the commission a copy of its findings and a request for approval to incur indebtedness to finance the making or modification of installations or the remodeling of buildings for the purpose of significantly reducing energy consumption. The facilities construction commission, in consultation with the auditor of state, may deny a request under division (G)(1) of this section by the board of education of any school district that is in a state of fiscal watch pursuant to division (A) of section 3316.03 of the Revised Code, if it determines that the expenditure of funds is not in the best interest of the school district.

The tax anticipation bonds may be sold at public or private sale, and at, or at not less than the price or prices as the authority determines. If any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any bonds or coupons ceases to be such officer before delivery of the bonds, the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be sufficient for all purposes as if the officer had remained in office until delivery of the bonds, and in case the seal of the authority has been changed after a facsimile has been imprinted on the bonds, the facsimile seal will continue to be sufficient for all purposes.

The resolution also shall state that the question of the additional tax shall be submitted to the electors of the school district at a special election. The resolution shall specify, for each year the levy is in effect, the amount of money that the levy is proposed to raise, which may, for years after the first year the levy is made, be expressed in terms of a dollar or percentage increase over the prior year's amount.

Immediately after its adoption, a copy of the resolution shall be certified to the county auditor of the proper county, who shall, within five days, calculate and certify to the board of education the estimated levy, for the first year, and for each subsequent year for which the tax is proposed to be in effect. The estimates shall be made both in mills for each dollar of valuation, and in dollars and cents for each one hundred dollars of valuation. In making the estimates, the auditor shall assume that the amount of the tax list remains throughout the life of the levy, the same as the tax list for the current year. If the tax list for the current year is not determined, the auditor shall base the auditor's estimates on the estimated amount of the tax list for the current year as submitted to the county budget commission. If the board desires to proceed with the submission of the question, it shall certify its resolution, with the estimated tax levy expressed in mills and dollars and cents per hundred dollars of valuation for each year that the tax is proposed to be in effect, to the board of elections of the proper county in the manner provided by division (A) of section 5705.251 of the Revised Code.

The estimated rate shall be the rate of the levy that the budget commission certifies with its action under this section. Each taxing authority, by ordinance or resolution, shall authorize the necessary tax levies and certify them to the county auditor before the first day of October in each year, or at such later date as is approved by the tax commissioner, except that the certification by the legislative authority of the city of Cincinnati or by a board of education shall be made by the first day of April or at such later date as is approved by the commissioner, and except that a township board of park commissioners that is appointed by the board of township trustees and oversees a township park district that contains only unincorporated territory shall authorize only those taxes approved by, and only at the rate approved by, the board of township trustees as required by division (C) of section 511.27 of the Revised Code. If the levying of a tax to be placed on the duplicate of the current year is approved by electors under sections 5705.01 to 5705.47 of the Revised Code; if the rate of a school district tax is increased due to the repeal of a school district income tax and property tax rate reduction at an election held pursuant to section 5748.04 of the Revised Code; or if refunding bonds to refund all or a part of the principal of bonds payable from a tax levy for the ensuing fiscal year are issued or sold and in the process of delivery, the budget commission shall reconsider and revise its action on the budget of the subdivision or school library district for whose benefit the tax is to be levied after the returns of such election are fully canvassed, or after the issuance or sale of such refunding bonds is certified to it.

The balance in a reserve balance account established under section 5705.132 of the Revised Code is not an unencumbered balance for the purposes of this division. There shall be attached to the certification a summary, which shall be known as the \"official certificate of estimated resources,\" that shall state the total estimated resources of each fund of the subdivision that are available for appropriation in the fiscal year, other than funds to be created by transfer, and a statement of the amount of the total tax duplicate of the school district to be used in the collection of taxes for the following calendar year. Before the end of the fiscal year, the taxing authority of each subdivision and other taxing unit shall revise its tax budget, if one was adopted, so that the total contemplated expenditures from any fund during the ensuing fiscal year will not exceed the total appropriations that may be made from such fund, as determined by the budget commission in its certification; and such revised budget shall be the basis of the annual appropriation measure.

(a) The value of all natural gas company tangible personal property, other than property described in division (E)(2) of this section, as assessed by the tax commissioner for tax year 1999 on a preliminary assessment, or an amended preliminary assessment if issued prior to March 1, 2000, and apportioned to the taxing district for tax year 1999; (b) The value of all natural gas company tangible personal property, other than property described in division (E)(2) of this section, as assessed by the tax commissioner for tax year 1999 had the property been apportioned to the taxing district for tax year 2001, and assessed at the rates in effect for tax year 2001. (2) The difference in the value of current gas obtained by subtracting the amount described in division (E)(2)(b) from the amount described in division (E)(2)(a) of this section. (a) The three-year average assessed value of current gas as assessed by the tax commissioner Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 163 for tax years 1997, 1998, and 1999 on a preliminary assessment, or an amended preliminary assessment if issued prior to March 1, 2001, and as apportioned in the taxing district for those respective years; (b) The three-year average assessed value from current gas under division (E)(2)(a) of this section for tax years 1997, 1998, and 1999, as reflected in the preliminary assessment, using an assessment rate of twenty-five per cent. (F) The tax commissioner may request that natural gas companies, electric companies, and rural electric companies file a report to help determine the tax value loss under divisions (D) and (E) of this section. The report shall be filed within thirty days of the commissioner's request. A company that fails to file the report or does not timely file the report is subject to the penalty in section 5727.60 of the Revised Code. (G) Not later than January 1, 2002, the tax commissioner shall determine for each school district, joint vocational school district, and local taxing unit its fixed-rate levy loss, which is the sum of its electric company tax value loss multiplied by the tax rate in effect in tax year 1998 for fixed- rate levies and its natural gas company tax value loss multiplied by the tax rate in effect in tax year 1999 for fixed-rate levies. (H) Not later than January 1, 2002, the tax commissioner shall determine for each school district, joint vocational school district, and local taxing unit its fixed-sum levy loss, which is the amount obtained by subtracting the amount described in division (H)(2) of this section from the amount described in division (H)(1) of this section: (1) The sum of the electric company tax value loss multiplied by the tax rate in effect in tax year 1998, and the natural gas company tax value loss multiplied by the tax rate in effect in tax year 1999, for fixed-sum levies for all taxing districts within each school district, joint vocational school district, and local taxing unit. For the years 2002 through 2006, this computation shall include school district emergency levies that existed in 1998 in the case of the electric company tax value loss, and 1999 in the case of the natural gas company tax value loss, and all other fixed-sum levies that existed in 1998 in the case of the electric company tax value loss and 1999 in the case of the natural gas company tax value loss and continue to be charged in the tax year preceding the distribution year. For the years 2007 through 2016 in the case of school district emergency levies, and for all years after 2006 in the case of all other fixed-sum levies, this computation shall exclude all fixed-sum levies that existed in 1998 in the case of the electric company tax value loss and 1999 in the case of the natural gas company tax value loss, but are no longer in effect in the tax year preceding the distribution year. For the purposes of this section, an emergency levy that existed in 1998 in the case of the electric company tax value loss, and 1999 in the case of the natural gas company tax value loss, continues to exist in a year beginning on or after January 1, 2007, but before January 1, 2017, if, in that year, the board of education levies a school district emergency levy for an annual sum at least equal to the annual sum levied by the board in tax year 1998 or 1999, respectively, less the amount of the payment certified under this division for 2002. (2) The total taxable value in tax year 1999 less the tax value loss in each school district, joint vocational school district, and local taxing unit multiplied by one-fourth of one mill. If the amount computed under division (H) of this section for any school district, joint vocational school district, or local taxing unit is greater than zero, that amount shall equal the fixed-Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 164 sum levy loss reimbursed pursuant to division (F) of section 5727.85 of the Revised Code or division (A)(2) of section 5727.86 of the Revised Code, and the one-fourth of one mill that is subtracted under division (H)(2) of this section shall be apportioned among all contributing fixed-sum levies in the proportion of each levy to the sum of all fixed-sum levies within each school district, joint vocational school district, or local taxing unit. (I) Notwithstanding divisions (D), (E), (G), and (H) of this section, in computing the tax value loss, fixed-rate levy loss, and fixed-sum levy loss, the tax commissioner shall use the greater of the 1998 tax rate or the 1999 tax rate in the case of levy losses associated with the electric company tax value loss, but the 1999 tax rate shall not include for this purpose any tax levy approved by the voters after June 30, 1999, and the tax commissioner shall use the greater of the 1999 or the 2000 tax rate in the case of levy losses associated with the natural gas company tax value loss. (J) Not later than January 1, 2002, the tax commissioner shall certify to the department of education the tax value loss determined under divisions (D) and (E) of this section for each taxing district, the fixed-rate levy loss calculated under division (G) of this section, and the fixed-sum levy loss calculated under division (H) of this section. The calculations under divisions (G) and (H) of this section shall separately display the levy loss for each levy eligible for reimbursement. (K) Not later than September 1, 2001, the tax commissioner shall certify the amount of the fixed-sum levy loss to the county auditor of each county in which a school district with a fixed-sum levy loss has territory. Sec. 5729.98. (A) To provide a uniform procedure for calculating the amount of tax due under this chapter, a taxpayer shall claim any credits and offsets against tax liability to which it is entitled in the following order: (1) The credit for an insurance company or insurance company group under section 5729.031 of the Revised Code; (2) The credit for eligible employee training costs under section 5729.07 of the Revised Code; (3) The credit for purchases of qualified low-income community investments under section 5729.16 of the Revised Code; (4) The nonrefundable job retention credit under division (B) of section 122.171 of the Revised Code; (5) The nonrefundable credit for investments in rural business growth funds under section 122.152 of the Revised Code; (6) The offset of assessments by the Ohio life and health insurance guaranty association against tax liability permitted by section 3956.20 of the Revised Code; (7) The refundable credit for rehabilitating a historic building under section 5729.17 of the Revised Code.; (8) The refundable credit for Ohio job retention under former division (B)(2) or (3) of section 122.171 of the Revised Code as those divisions existed before September 29, 2015, the effective date of the amendment of this section by H.B. 64 of the 131st general assembly; (9) The refundable credit for Ohio job creation under section 5729.032 of the Revised Code; (10) The refundable credit under section 5729.08 of the Revised Code for losses on loans made under the Ohio venture capital program under sections 150.01 to 150.10 of the Revised Code.Am.

No. 197 133rd G.A. 165 (B) For any credit except the refundable credits enumerated in this section, the amount of the credit for a taxable year shall not exceed the tax due after allowing for any other credit that precedes it in the order required under this section. Any excess amount of a particular credit may be carried forward if authorized under the section creating that credit. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow a taxpayer to claim, directly or indirectly, a credit more than once for a taxable year. Sec. 5733.042. (A) As used in this section: (1) \"Affiliated group\" has the same meaning as in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code. (2) \"Asset value\" means the adjusted basis of assets as determined in accordance with Subchapter O of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. (3) \"Intangible expenses and costs\" include expenses, losses, and costs for, related to, or in connection directly or indirectly with the direct or indirect acquisition of, the direct or indirect use of, the direct or indirect maintenance or management of, the direct or indirect ownership of, the direct or indirect sale of, the direct or indirect exchange of, or any other direct or indirect disposition of intangible property to the extent such amounts are allowed as deductions or costs in determining taxable income before operating loss deduction and special deductions for the taxable year under the Internal Revenue Code. Such expenses and costs include, but are not limited to, losses related to or incurred in connection directly or indirectly with factoring transactions, losses related to or incurred in connection directly or indirectly with discounting transactions, royalty, patent, technical, and copyright fees, licensing fees, and other similar expenses and costs. (4) \"Interest expenses and costs\" include but are not limited to amounts directly or indirectly allowed as deductions under section 163 of the Internal Revenue Code for purposes of determining taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code. (5) \"Member\" has the same meaning as in U.S. Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-1. (6) \"Related member\" means a person that, with respect to the taxpayer during all or any portion of the taxable year, is a \"related entity\" as defined in division (I)(12)(c) of section 5733.04 of the Revised Code, is a component member as defined in section 1563(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, or is a person to or from whom there is attribution of stock ownership in accordance with section 1563(e) of the Internal Revenue Code except, for purposes of determining whether a person is a related member under this division, \"twenty per cent\" shall be substituted for \"5 per cent\" wherever \"5 per cent\" appears in section 1563(e) of the Internal Revenue Code. (B) This section applies to all corporations for tax years 1999 and thereafter. For tax years prior to 1999, this section applies only to a corporation that has, or is a member of an affiliated group that has, or is a member of an affiliated group with another member that has, one or more of the following: (1) Gross sales, including sales to other members of the affiliated group, during the taxable year of at least fifty million dollars; (2) Total assets whose asset value at any time during the taxable year is at least twenty-five million dollars; (3) Taxable income before operating loss deduction and special deductions during the taxable year of at least five hundred thousand dollars. (C) For purposes of computing its net income under division (I) of section 5733.04 of the Revised Code, the corporation shall add interest expenses and costs and intangible expenses and Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 166 costs directly or indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred to, or in connection directly or indirectly with one or more direct or indirect transactions with, one or more of the following related members: (1) Any related member whose activities, in any one state, are primarily limited to the maintenance and management of intangible investments or of the intangible investments of corporations, business trusts, or other entities registered as investment companies under the \"Investment Company Act of 1940,\" 15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq., as amended, and the collection and distribution of the income from such investments or from tangible property physically located outside such state. For purposes of division (C)(1) of this section, \"intangible investments\" includes, without limitation, investments in stocks, bonds, notes, and other debt obligations, including debt obligations of related members, interests in partnerships, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade names, and similar types of intangible assets. (2) Any related member that is a personal holding company as defined in section 542 of the Internal Revenue Code without regard to the stock ownership requirements set forth in section 542(a) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code; (3) Any related member that is not a corporation and is directly, indirectly, constructively, or beneficially owned in whole or in part by a personal holding company as defined in section 542 of the Internal Revenue Code without regard to the stock ownership requirements set forth in section 542(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code; (4) Any related member that is a foreign personal holding company as defined in section 552 of the Internal Revenue Code; (5) Any related member that is not a corporation and is directly, indirectly, constructively, or beneficially owned in whole or in part by a foreign personal holding company as defined in section 552 of the Internal Revenue Code; (6) Any related member if that related member or another related member directly or indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred to, or in connection directly or indirectly with one or more direct or indirect transactions with, another related member any interest expenses and costs or intangible expenses and costs in an amount less than, equal to, or greater than such amounts received from the corporation. Division (C)(6) of this section applies only if, within a one-hundred-twenty-month period commencing three years prior to the beginning of the tax year, a related member directly or indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred such amounts or losses with respect to one or more direct or indirect transactions with an entity described in divisions (C)(1) to (5) of this section. A rebuttable presumption exists that a related member did so pay, accrue, or incur such amounts or losses with respect to one or more direct or indirect transactions with an entity described in divisions (C)(1) to (5) of this section. A corporation can rebut this presumption only with a preponderance of the evidence to the contrary. (7) Any related member that, with respect to indebtedness directly or indirectly owed by the corporation to the related member, directly or indirectly charged or imposed on the corporation an excess interest rate. If the related member has charged or imposed on the corporation an excess interest rate, the adjustment required by division (C)(7) of this section with respect to such interest expenses and costs directly or indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred to the related member in connection with such indebtedness does not include so much of such interest expenses and costs that the corporation would have directly or indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred if the related member had Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 167 charged or imposed the highest possible interest rate that would not have been an excess interest rate. For purposes of division (C)(7) of this section, an excess interest rate is an annual rate that exceeds by more than three per cent the greater of the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code in effect at the time of the origination of the indebtedness, or the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code in effect at the time the corporation paid, accrued, or incurred the interest expense or cost to the related member. (D)(1) In making the adjustment required by division (C) of this section, the corporation shall make the adjustment required by section 5733.057 of the Revised Code. The adjustments required by division (C) of this section are not required if either of the following applies: (a) The corporation establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the adjustments are unreasonable. (b) The corporation and the tax commissioner agree in writing to the application or use of alternative adjustments and computations to more properly reflect the base required to be determined in accordance with division (B) of section 5733.05 of the Revised Code. Nothing in division (D)(1) (b) of this section shall be construed to limit or negate the tax commissioner's authority to otherwise enter into agreements and compromises otherwise allowed by law. (2) The adjustments required by divisions (C)(1) to (5) of this section do not apply to such portion of interest expenses and costs and intangible expenses and costs that the corporation can establish by the preponderance of the evidence meets both of the following: (a) The related member during the same taxable year directly or indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred such portion to a person who is not a related member. (b) The transaction giving rise to the interest expenses and costs or the intangible expenses and costs between the corporation and the related member did not have as a principal purpose the avoidance of any portion of the tax due under this chapter. (3) The adjustments required by division (C)(6) of this section do not apply to such portion of interest expenses and costs and intangible expenses and costs that the corporation can establish by the preponderance of the evidence meets both of the following: (a) The entity described in any of divisions (C)(1) to (6) of this section to whom the related member directly or indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred such portion, in turn during the same taxable year directly or indirectly paid, accrued or incurred such portion to a person who is not a related member, and (b) The transaction or transactions giving rise to the interest expenses and costs or the intangible expenses and costs between the corporation, the related member, and the entity described in any of divisions (C)(1) to (5) of this section did not have as a principal purpose the avoidance of any portion of the tax due under this chapter. (4) The adjustments required by division (C) of this section apply except to the extent that the increased tax, if any, attributable to such adjustments would have been avoided if both the corporation and the related member had been eligible to make and had timely made the election to combine in accordance with division (B) of section 5733.052 of the Revised Code. (E) Except as otherwise provided in division (F) of this section, if, on the day that is one year after the day the corporation files its report, the corporation has not made the adjustment required by this section or has not fully paid the tax and interest, if any, imposed by this chapter and attributable Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 168 to such adjustment, the corporation is subject to a penalty equal to twice the interest charged under division (A) of section 5733.26 of the Revised Code for the delinquent payment of such tax and interest. For the purpose of the computation of the penalty imposed by this division, such penalty shall be deemed to be part of the tax due on the dates prescribed by this chapter without regard to the one-year period set forth in this division. The penalty imposed by this division is not in lieu of but is in addition to all other penalties, other similar charges, and interest imposed by this chapter. The tax commissioner may waive, abate, modify, or refund, with interest, all or any portion of the penalty imposed by this division only if the corporation establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that both the failure to fully comply with this section and the failure to fully pay such tax and interest within one year after the date the corporation files its report were not in any part attributable to the avoidance of any portion of the tax imposed by section 5733.06 of the Revised Code. (F)(1) For purposes of this division, \"tax differential\" means the difference between the tax that is imposed by section 5733.06 of the Revised Code and that is attributable to the adjustment required by this section and the amount paid that is so attributable, prior to the day that is one year after the day the corporation files its report. (2) The penalty imposed by division (E) of this section does not apply if the tax differential meets both of the following requirements: (a) The tax differential is less than ten per cent of the tax imposed by section 5733.06 of the Revised Code; and (b) The difference is less than fifty thousand dollars. (3) Nothing in division (F) of this section shall be construed to waive, abate, or modify any other penalties, other similar charges, or interest imposed by other sections of this chapter. (G) Nothing in this section shall require a corporation to add to its net income more than once any amount of interest expenses and costs or intangible expenses and costs that the corporation pays, accrues, or incurs to a related member described in division (C) of this section. Sec. 5733.05. As used in this section, \"qualified research\" means laboratory research, experimental research, and other similar types of research; research in developing or improving a product; or research in developing or improving the means of producing a product. It does not include market research, consumer surveys, efficiency surveys, management studies, ordinary testing or inspection of materials or products for quality control, historical research, or literary research. \"Product\" as used in this paragraph does not include services or intangible property. The annual report determines the value of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of the taxpayer, which under division (A) or divisions (B) and (C) of this section is the base or measure of the franchise tax liability. Such determination shall be made as of the date shown by the report to have been the beginning of the corporation's annual accounting period that includes the first day of January of the tax year. For the purposes of this chapter, the value of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of any corporation that is a financial institution shall be deemed to be the value as calculated in accordance with division (A) of this section. For the purposes of this chapter, the value of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of any corporation that is not a financial institution shall be deemed to be the values as calculated in accordance with divisions (B) and (C) of this section. Except as otherwise required by this section or section 5733.056 of the Revised Code, the value of a taxpayer's issued and outstanding shares of stock under division (A) or (C) of this section does not Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 169 include any amount that is treated as a liability under generally accepted accounting principles. (A) The total value, as shown by the books of the financial institution, of its capital, surplus, whether earned or unearned, undivided profits, and reserves shall be determined as prescribed by section 5733.056 of the Revised Code for tax years 1998 and thereafter. (B) The sum of the corporation's net income during the corporation's taxable year, allocated or apportioned to this state as prescribed in divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this section, and subject to sections 5733.052, 5733.053, 5733.057, 5733.058, 5733.059, and 5733.0510 of the Revised Code: (1) The net nonbusiness income allocated or apportioned to this state as provided by section 5733.051 of the Revised Code. (2) The amount of Ohio apportioned net business income, which shall be calculated by multiplying the corporation's net business income by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the sum of the following products: the property factor multiplied by twenty, the payroll factor multiplied by twenty, and the sales factor multiplied by sixty. The denominator of the fraction is one hundred, provided that the denominator shall be reduced by twenty if the property factor has a denominator of zero, by twenty if the payroll factor has a denominator of zero, and by sixty if the sales factor has a denominator of zero. The property, payroll, and sales factors shall be determined as follows, but the numerator and the denominator of the factors shall not include the portion of any property, payroll, and sales otherwise includible in the factors to the extent that the portion relates to, or is used in connection with, the production of nonbusiness income allocated under section 5733.051 of the Revised Code: (a) The property factor is a fraction computed as follows: The numerator of the fraction is the average value of the corporation's real and tangible personal property owned or rented, and used in the trade or business in this state during the taxable year, and the denominator of the fraction is the average value of all the corporation's real and tangible personal property owned or rented, and used in the trade or business everywhere during such year. Real and tangible personal property used in the trade or business includes, but is not limited to, real and tangible personal property that the corporation rents, subrents, leases, or subleases to others if the income or loss from such rentals, subrentals, leases, or subleases is business income. There shall be excluded from the numerator and denominator of the fraction the original cost of all of the following property within Ohio: property with respect to which a \"pollution control facility\" certificate has been issued pursuant to section 5709.21 of the Revised Code; property with respect to which an \"industrial water pollution control certificate\" has been issued pursuant to that section or former section 6111.31 of the Revised Code; and property used exclusively during the taxable year for qualified research. (i) Property owned by the corporation is valued at its original cost. Property rented by the corporation is valued at eight times the net annual rental rate. \"Net annual rental rate\" means the annual rental rate paid by the corporation less any annual rental rate received by the corporation from subrentals. (ii) The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and the end of the taxable year, but the tax commissioner may require the averaging of monthly values during the taxable year, if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the corporation's property. (b) The payroll factor is a fraction computed as follows:Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 170 The numerator of the fraction is the total amount paid in this state during the taxable year by the corporation for compensation, and the denominator of the fraction is the total compensation paid everywhere by the corporation during such year. There shall be excluded from the numerator and the denominator of the payroll factor the total compensation paid in this state to employees who are primarily engaged in qualified research. (i) Compensation means any form of remuneration paid to an employee for personal services. (ii) Compensation is paid in this state if: (I) the recipient's service is performed entirely within this state, (II) the recipient's service is performed both within and without this state, but the service performed without this state is incidental to the recipient's service within this state, (III) some of the service is performed within this state and either the base of operations, or if there is no base of operations, the place from which the service is directed or controlled is within this state, or the base of operations or the place from which the service is directed or controlled is not in any state in which some part of the service is performed, but the recipient's residence is in this state. (iii) Compensation is paid in this state to any employee of a common or contract motor carrier corporation, who performs the employee's regularly assigned duties on a motor vehicle in more than one state, in the same ratio by which the mileage traveled by such employee within the state bears to the total mileage traveled by such employee everywhere during the taxable year. (c) The sales factor is a fraction computed as follows: Except as provided in this section, the numerator of the fraction is the total sales in this state by the corporation during the taxable year or part thereof, and the denominator of the fraction is the total sales by the corporation everywhere during such year or part thereof. In computing the numerator and denominator of the fraction, the following shall be eliminated from the fraction: receipts and any related gains or losses from the sale or other disposal of excluded assets; dividends or distributions; and interest or other similar amounts received for the use of, or for the forbearance of the use of, money. Also, in computing the numerator and denominator of the sales factor, in the case of a corporation owning at least eighty per cent of the issued and outstanding common stock of one or more insurance companies or public utilities, except an electric company and a combined company, and, for tax years 2005 and thereafter, a telephone company, or owning at least twenty-five per cent of the issued and outstanding common stock of one or more financial institutions, receipts received by the corporation from such utilities, insurance companies, and financial institutions shall be eliminated. As used in this division, \"excluded assets\" means property that is either: intangible property, other than trademarks, trade names, patents, copyrights, and similar intellectual property; or tangible personal property or real property where that property is a capital asset or an asset described in section 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code, without regard to the holding period specified therein. (i) For the purpose of this section and section 5733.03 of the Revised Code, receipts not eliminated or excluded from the fraction shall be sitused as follows: Receipts from rents and royalties from real property located in this state shall be sitused to this state. Receipts from rents and royalties of tangible personal property, to the extent the tangible personal property is used in this state, shall be sitused to this state. Receipts from the sale of electricity and of electric transmission and distribution services shall be sitused to this state in the manner provided under section 5733.059 of the Revised Code.Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 171 Receipts from the sale of real property located in this state shall be sitused to this state. Receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be sitused to this state if such property is received in this state by the purchaser. In the case of delivery of tangible personal property by common carrier or by other means of transportation, the place at which such property is ultimately received after all transportation has been completed shall be considered as the place at which such property is received by the purchaser. Direct delivery in this state, other than for purposes of transportation, to a person or firm designated by a purchaser constitutes delivery to the purchaser in this state, and direct delivery outside this state to a person or firm designated by a purchaser does not constitute delivery to the purchaser in this state, regardless of where title passes or other conditions of sale. (ii) Receipts from all other sales not eliminated or excluded from the fraction shall be sitused to this state as follows: Receipts from the sale, exchange, disposition, or other grant of the right to use trademarks, trade names, patents, copyrights, and similar intellectual property shall be sitused to this state to the extent that the receipts are based on the amount of use of that property in this state. If the receipts are not based on the amount of use of that property, but rather on the right to use the property and the payor has the right to use the property in this state, then the receipts from the sale, exchange, disposition, or other grant of the right to use such property shall be sitused to this state to the extent the receipts are based on the right to use the property in this state. Receipts from the sale of services, and receipts from any other sales not eliminated or excluded from the sales factor and not otherwise sitused under division (B)(2)(c) of this section, shall be sitused to this state in the proportion to the purchaser's benefit, with respect to the sale, in this state to the purchaser's benefit, with respect to the sale, everywhere. The physical location where the purchaser ultimately uses or receives the benefit of what was purchased shall be paramount in determining the proportion of the benefit in this state to the benefit everywhere. (iii) Income from receipts eliminated or excluded from the sales factor under division (B)(2) (c) of this section shall not be presumed to be nonbusiness income. (d) If the allocation and apportionment provisions of division (B) of this section do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in this state, the taxpayer may request, which request must be in writing and must accompany the report, a timely filed petition for reassessment, or a timely filed amended report, or the tax commissioner may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's allocated or apportioned base, if reasonable, any one or more of the following: (i) Separate accounting; (ii) The exclusion of any one or more of the factors; (iii) The inclusion of one or more additional factors that will fairly represent the taxpayer's allocated or apportioned base in this state. An alternative method will be effective only with approval by the tax commissioner. Nothing in this section shall be construed to extend any statute of limitations set forth in this chapter. (e) The tax commissioner may adopt rules providing for alternative allocation and apportionment methods, and alternative calculations of a corporation's base, that apply to corporations engaged in telecommunications.Am.

For the purposes of determining that total value, any reserves shown on the corporation's books shall be considered liabilities or contra assets, as the case may be, except for any reserves that are deemed appropriations of retained earnings under generally accepted accounting principles. (2) The base upon which the tax is levied under division (C) of section 5733.06 of the Revised Code shall be computed by multiplying the amount determined under division (C)(1) of this section by the fraction determined under divisions (B)(2)(a) to (c) of this section and, if applicable, divisions (B)(2)(d)(ii) and (iii) of this section, and without regard to section 5733.052 of the Revised Code, but substituting \"net worth\" for \"net income\" wherever \"net income\" appears in division (B)(2) (c) in this section. For purposes of division (C)(2) of this section, the numerator and denominator of each of the fractions shall include the portion of any real and tangible personal property, payroll, and sales, respectively, relating to, or used in connection with the production of, net nonbusiness income allocated under section 5733.051 of the Revised Code.

(D)(1) If, on the last day of the taxpayer's taxable year preceding the tax year, the taxpayer is a related member to a corporation that elects to be a qualifying holding company for the tax year beginning after the last day of the taxpayer's taxable year, or if, on the last day of the taxpayer's taxable year preceding the tax year, a corporation that elects to be a qualifying holding company for the tax year beginning after the last day of the taxpayer's taxable year is a related member to the taxpayer, then the taxpayer's total value for the purposes of division (C) of this section shall be adjusted by the qualifying amount. Except as otherwise provided under division (D)(2) of this section, \"qualifying amount\" means the amount that, when added to the taxpayer's total value, and when subtracted from the net carrying value of the taxpayer's liabilities computed without regard to division (C)(2) of this section, or when subtracted from the taxpayer's total value and when added to the net carrying value of the taxpayer's liabilities computed without regard to division (D) of this section, results in the taxpayer's debt-to-equity ratio equaling the debt-to-equity ratio of the qualifying controlled group on the last day of the taxable year ending prior to the first day of the tax year computed on a consolidated basis in accordance with general accepted accounting principles. For the purposes of division (D)(1) of this section, the corporation's total value, after the adjustment required by that division, shall not exceed the net book value of the corporation's assets. (2)(a) The amount added to the taxpayer's total value and subtracted from the net carrying value of the taxpayer's liabilities shall not exceed the amount of the net carrying value of the taxpayer's liabilities owed to the taxpayer's related members. (b) A liability owed to the taxpayer's related members includes, but is not limited to, any amount that the corporation owes to a person that is not a related member if the corporation's related member or related members in whole or in part guarantee any portion or all of that amount, or pledge, hypothecate, mortgage, or carry out any similar transactions to secure any portion or all of Am.

(3) The base upon which the tax is levied under division (C) of section 5733.06 of the Revised Code shall be computed by multiplying the amount determined under divisions (C) and (D) of this section but without regard to section 5733.052 of the Revised Code. (4) For purposes of division (D) of this section, \"related member\" has the same meaning as in section 5733.042 of the Revised Code. Sec. 5733.052. (A) At the discretion of the tax commissioner, any taxpayer that owns or controls either directly or indirectly more than fifty per cent of the capital stock with voting rights of one or more other corporations, or has more than fifty per cent of its capital stock with voting rights owned or controlled either directly or indirectly by another corporation, or by related interests that own or control either directly or indirectly more than fifty per cent of the capital stock with voting rights of one or more other corporations, may be required or permitted, for purposes of computing the value of its issued and outstanding shares of stock under division (B) of section 5733.05 of the Revised Code, to combine its net income with the net income of any such other corporations. (B) A combination of net income may also be made at the election of any two or more taxpayers each having income, other than dividend or distribution income, from sources within Ohio, provided the ownership or control requirements contained in the division (A) of this section are satisfied and such combination is elected in a timely report which sets forth such information as the commissioner requires. This election, once made by two or more such taxpayers, may not be changed by such taxpayers with respect to amended reports or reports for future years without the written consent of the commissioner. As used in this section, \"income from sources within Ohio\" means income that would be allocated or apportioned to Ohio if the taxpayer computed its franchise tax without regard to this section. (C) No combination of net income under division (A) of this section shall be required unless the commissioner determines that, in order to properly reflect income, such a combination is necessary because of intercorporate transactions and the tax liability imposed by section 5733.06 of the Revised Code. (D) In case of a combination of income, the net income of each taxpayer shall be measured by the combined net income of all the corporations included in the combination. For purposes of such measurement, each corporation's net income shall be determined in the same manner as if the corporation were a taxpayer under this chapter. In computing combined net income, intercorporate transactions, including dividends or distributions, between corporations included in the combination shall be eliminated. If the computation of net income on a combination of income involves the use of any of the formulas set forth in this chapter, the factors used in the formulas shall be the combined totals of the factors for each corporation included in the combination after the elimination of any intercorporate transactions. The exemptions and deductions permitted under this chapter shall be taken in the same manner as if each corporation filed a separate report. (E) For purposes of division (B) of section 5733.05 of the Revised Code, each taxpayer's net income allocated or apportioned to this state shall be computed as follows: to compute the taxpayer's net income allocated to this state for purposes of division (B)(1) of section 5733.05 of the Revised Code, the taxpayer's net income for sources allocated under section 5733.051 of the Revised Code shall be separately determined, eliminating intercorporate transactions, and allocated to this state as Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 174 provided by section 5733.051 of the Revised Code. To compute the taxpayer's net income apportioned to this state for purposes of division (B)(2) of section 5733.05 of the Revised Code, the combined net income, other than net income from sources allocated under section 5733.051 of the Revised Code, shall be apportioned to Ohio and then prorated to the taxpayer on the basis of its proportionate part of the factors used to apportion the total of such net income to Ohio.

(B)(1)(a) If any sale is claimed to be exempt under division (E) of section 5739.01 of the Revised Code or under section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, with the exception of divisions (B)(1) to (11), (28), (48), or (55), or (57) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, or if the consumer claims the transaction is not a taxable sale due to one or more of the exclusions provided under divisions (JJ) (1) to (5) of section 5739.01 of the Revised Code, the consumer must provide to the vendor, and the vendor must obtain from the consumer, a certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the tax. The certificate shall be in such form, and shall be provided either in a hard copy form or electronic form, as the tax commissioner prescribes. (b) A vendor that obtains a fully completed exemption certificate from a consumer is relieved of liability for collecting and remitting tax on any sale covered by that certificate. If it is determined the exemption was improperly claimed, the consumer shall be liable for any tax due on that sale under section 5739.02, 5739.021, 5739.023, or 5739.026 or Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code. Relief under this division from liability does not apply to any of the following: (i) A vendor that fraudulently fails to collect tax; (ii) A vendor that solicits consumers to participate in the unlawful claim of an exemption; (iii) A vendor that accepts an exemption certificate from a consumer that claims an exemption based on who purchases or who sells property or a service, when the subject of the transaction sought to be covered by the exemption certificate is actually received by the consumer at a location operated by the vendor in this state, and this state has posted to its web site an exemption certificate form that clearly and affirmatively indicates that the claimed exemption is not available in this state; (iv) A vendor that accepts an exemption certificate from a consumer who claims a multiple points of use exemption under division (D) of section 5739.033 of the Revised Code, if the item purchased is tangible personal property, other than prewritten computer software. (2) The vendor shall maintain records, including exemption certificates, of all sales on which Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 223 a consumer has claimed an exemption, and provide them to the tax commissioner on request. (3) The tax commissioner may establish an identification system whereby the commissioner issues an identification number to a consumer that is exempt from payment of the tax. The consumer must present the number to the vendor, if any sale is claimed to be exempt as provided in this section. (4) If no certificate is provided or obtained within ninety days after the date on which such sale is consummated, it shall be presumed that the tax applies. Failure to have so provided or obtained a certificate shall not preclude a vendor, within one hundred twenty days after the tax commissioner gives written notice of intent to levy an assessment, from either establishing that the sale is not subject to the tax, or obtaining, in good faith, a fully completed exemption certificate. (5) Certificates need not be obtained nor provided where the identity of the consumer is such that the transaction is never subject to the tax imposed or where the item of tangible personal property sold or the service provided is never subject to the tax imposed, regardless of use, or when the sale is in interstate commerce. (6) If a transaction is claimed to be exempt under division (B)(13) of section 5739.02 of the Revised Code, the contractor shall obtain certification of the claimed exemption from the contractee. This certification shall be in addition to an exemption certificate provided by the contractor to the vendor. A contractee that provides a certification under this division shall be deemed to be the consumer of all items purchased by the contractor under the claim of exemption, if it is subsequently determined that the exemption is not properly claimed. The certification shall be in such form as the tax commissioner prescribes. (C) As used in this division, \"contractee\" means a person who seeks to enter or enters into a contract or agreement with a contractor or vendor for the construction of real property or for the sale and installation onto real property of tangible personal property. Any contractor or vendor may request from any contractee a certification of what portion of the property to be transferred under such contract or agreement is to be incorporated into the realty and what portion will retain its status as tangible personal property after installation is completed. The contractor or vendor shall request the certification by certified mail delivered to the contractee, return receipt requested. Upon receipt of such request and prior to entering into the contract or agreement, the contractee shall provide to the contractor or vendor a certification sufficiently detailed to enable the contractor or vendor to ascertain the resulting classification of all materials purchased or fabricated by the contractor or vendor and transferred to the contractee. This requirement applies to a contractee regardless of whether the contractee holds a direct payment permit under section 5739.031 of the Revised Code or provides to the contractor or vendor an exemption certificate as provided under this section. For the purposes of the taxes levied by this chapter and Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code, the contractor or vendor may in good faith rely on the contractee's certification. Notwithstanding division (B) of section 5739.01 of the Revised Code, if the tax commissioner determines that certain property certified by the contractee as tangible personal property pursuant to this division is, in fact, real property, the contractee shall be considered to be the consumer of all materials so incorporated into that real property and shall be liable for the applicable tax, and the contractor or vendor shall be excused from any liability on those materials. If a contractee fails to provide such certification upon the request of the contractor or vendor, Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 224 the contractor or vendor shall comply with the provisions of this chapter and Chapter 5741. of the Revised Code without the certification. If the tax commissioner determines that such compliance has been performed in good faith and that certain property treated as tangible personal property by the contractor or vendor is, in fact, real property, the contractee shall be considered to be the consumer of all materials so incorporated into that real property and shall be liable for the applicable tax, and the construction contractor or vendor shall be excused from any liability on those materials. This division does not apply to any contract or agreement where the tax commissioner determines as a fact that a certification under this division was made solely on the decision or advice of the contractor or vendor. (D) Notwithstanding division (B) of section 5739.01 of the Revised Code, whenever the total rate of tax imposed under this chapter is increased after the date after a construction contract is entered into, the contractee shall reimburse the construction contractor for any additional tax paid on tangible property consumed or services received pursuant to the contract. (E) A vendor who files a petition for reassessment contesting the assessment of tax on sales for which the vendor obtained no valid exemption certificates and for which the vendor failed to establish that the sales were properly not subject to the tax during the one-hundred-twenty-day period allowed under division (B) of this section, may present to the tax commissioner additional evidence to prove that the sales were properly subject to a claim of exception or exemption. The vendor shall file such evidence within ninety days of the receipt by the vendor of the notice of assessment, except that, upon application and for reasonable cause, the period for submitting such evidence shall be extended thirty days. The commissioner shall consider such additional evidence in reaching the final determination on the assessment and petition for reassessment. (F) Whenever a vendor refunds the price, minus any separately stated delivery charge, of an item of tangible personal property on which the tax imposed under this chapter has been paid, the vendor shall also refund the amount of tax paid, minus the amount of tax attributable to the delivery charge.

Seizure and sale shall not be deemed to relieve any person from the fine or imprisonment provided for violation of sections 5743.01 to 5743.20 of the Revised Code or from a civil penalty under section 3739.99 of the Revised Code. A sale shall be made where it is most convenient and economical.

No. 197 133rd G.A. 253 the distribution is made to the extent that the portion was not included in the trust's taxable income for any of the trust's taxable years beginning in 2002 or thereafter. \"Undistributed net income of a trust\" means the taxable income of the trust increased by (a)(i) the additions to adjusted gross income required under division (A) of this section and (ii) the personal exemptions allowed to the trust pursuant to section 642(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, and decreased by (b)(i) the deductions to adjusted gross income required under division (A) of this section, (ii) the amount of federal income taxes attributable to such income, and (iii) the amount of taxable income that has been included in the adjusted gross income of a beneficiary by reason of a prior accumulation distribution.

(F) Nothing in this section requires any item of income, gain, or loss not satisfying the definition of qualifying investment income to be treated as modified nonbusiness income. Any item of income, gain, or loss that is not qualifying investment income is modified business income, Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 272 modified nonbusiness income, or a qualifying trust amount, as the case may be. Sec. 5747.013.

The denominator of the fraction is one hundred, provided that the denominator shall be reduced by twenty if the property factor has a denominator of zero, by twenty if the payroll factor has a denominator of zero, and by sixty if the sales factor has a denominator of zero. The property, payroll, and sales factors shall be determined as follows: (1) The property factor is a fraction the numerator of which is the average value of the trust's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in the trade or business in this state during the taxable year, and the denominator of which is the average value of all the trust's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in the trade or business everywhere during such year. Real and tangible personal property that is owned but leased to a lessee to be used in the lessee's trade or business shall not be included in the property factor of the owner. There shall be excluded from the numerator and denominator of the fraction the original cost of all of the following property within Ohio: property with respect to which a \"pollution control facility\" certificate has been issued pursuant to section 5709.21 of the Revised Code; property with respect to which an \"industrial water pollution control certificate\" has been issued pursuant to that section or former section 6111.31 of the Revised Code; and property used exclusively during the taxable year for qualified research. (a) Property owned by the trust is valued at its original cost. Property rented by the trust is valued at eight times the net annual rental rate. \"Net annual rental rate\" means the annual rental rate paid by the trust less any annual rental rate received by the trust from subrentals. (b) The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and the end of the taxable year, but the tax commissioner may require the averaging of monthly values during the taxable year, if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the trust's property. (2) The payroll factor is a fraction the numerator of which is the total amount paid in this state during the taxable year by the trust for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere by the trust during such year. There shall be excluded from the numerator and the denominator of the payroll factor the total compensation paid in this state to employees who are primarily engaged in qualified research.

No. 197 133rd G.A. 273 this state; (ii) the recipient's service is performed both within and without this state, but the service performed without this state is incidental to the recipient's service within this state; or (iii) some of the service is performed within this state and either the base of operations, or if there is no base of operations, the place from which the service is directed or controlled, is within this state, or the base of operations or the place from which the service is directed or controlled is not in any state in which some part of the service is performed, but the recipient's residence is in this state. (b) Compensation is paid in this state to any employee of a common or contract motor carrier corporation, who performs the employee's regularly assigned duties on a motor vehicle in more than one state, in the same ratio by which the mileage traveled by such employee within the state bears to the total mileage traveled by such employee everywhere during the taxable year. (3) The sales factor is a fraction the numerator of which is the total sales in this state by the trust during the taxable year, and the denominator of which is the total sales by the trust everywhere during such year. In determining the numerator and denominator of the fraction, receipts from the sale or other disposal of a capital asset or an asset described in section 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be eliminated. Also, in determining the numerator and denominator of the sales factor, in the case of a trust owning at least eighty per cent of the issued and outstanding common stock of one or more insurance companies or public utilities, except an electric company and a combined company, and, for tax years 2005 and thereafter, a telephone company, or owning at least twenty-five per cent of the issued and outstanding common stock of one or more financial institutions, receipts received by the trust from such insurance companies, utilities, and financial institutions shall be eliminated. For the purpose of this section and section 5747.08 of the Revised Code, sales of tangible personal property are in this state where such property is received in this state by the purchaser. In the case of delivery of tangible personal property by common carrier or by other means of transportation, the place at which such property is ultimately received after all transportation has been completed shall be considered as the place at which such property is received by the purchaser. Direct delivery in this state, other than for purposes of transportation, to a person or firm designated by a purchaser constitutes delivery to the purchaser in this state, and direct delivery outside this state to a person or firm designated by a purchaser does not constitute delivery to the purchaser in this state, regardless of where title passes or other conditions of sale. Sales, other than sales of tangible personal property, are in this state if either: (a) The income-producing activity is performed solely in this state; or (b) The income-producing activity is performed both within and without this state and a greater proportion of the seller's income-producing activity is performed within this state than in any other state, based on costs of performance.

Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 274 in this state under the Constitution of the United States, an annual tax measured as prescribed in divisions (A)(1) to (4) of this section. (1) In the case of trusts, the tax imposed by this section shall be measured by modified Ohio taxable income under division (D) of this section and levied in the same amount as the tax is imposed on estates as prescribed in division (A)(2) of this section. (2) In the case of estates, the tax imposed by this section shall be measured by Ohio taxable income. The tax shall be levied at the rate of one and forty-two thousand seven hundred forty-four hundred-thousandths per cent for the first twenty-one thousand seven hundred fifty dollars of such income and, for income in excess of that amount, the tax shall be levied at the same rates prescribed in division (A)(3) of this section for individuals. (3) In the case of individuals, the tax imposed by this section on income other than taxable business income shall be measured by Ohio adjusted gross income, less taxable business income and less an exemption for the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, and each dependent as provided in section 5747.025 of the Revised Code. If the balance thus obtained is equal to or less than twenty-one thousand seven hundred fifty dollars, no tax shall be imposed on that balance. If the balance thus obtained is greater than twenty-one thousand seven hundred fifty dollars, the tax is hereby levied as follows: 1 2 AOHIO ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME LESS TAXABLE BUSINESS INCOME AND EXEMPTIONS (INDIVIDUALS) OR MODIFIED OHIO TAXABLE INCOME (TRUSTS) OR OHIO TAXABLE INCOME (ESTATES)TAX BMore than $21,750 but not more than $43,450$310.47 plus 2.850% of the amount in excess of $21,750 CMore than $43,450 but not more than $86,900$928.92 plus 3.326% of the amount in excess of $43,450 DMore than $86,900 but not more than $108,700$2,374.07 plus 3.802% of the amount in excess of $86,900 EMore than $108,700 but not more than $3,202.91 plus 4.413% of the amount in Am.

(b) If the exemptions allowed to an individual under division (A)(3) of this section exceed the taxpayer's Ohio adjusted gross income less taxable business income, the excess shall be deducted from taxable business income before computing the tax under division (A)(4)(a) of this section. (5) Except as otherwise provided in this division, in August of each year, the tax commissioner shall make a new adjustment to the income amounts prescribed in divisions (A)(2) and (3) of this section by multiplying the percentage increase in the gross domestic product deflator computed that year under section 5747.025 of the Revised Code by each of the income amounts resulting from the adjustment under this division in the preceding year, adding the resulting product to the corresponding income amount resulting from the adjustment in the preceding year, and rounding the resulting sum to the nearest multiple of fifty dollars. The tax commissioner also shall recompute each of the tax dollar amounts to the extent necessary to reflect the new adjustment of the income amounts. To recompute the tax dollar amount corresponding to the lowest tax rate in division (A)(3) of this section, the commissioner shall multiply the tax rate prescribed in division (A)(2) of this section by the income amount specified in that division and as adjusted according to this paragraph. The rates of taxation shall not be adjusted. The adjusted amounts apply to taxable years beginning in the calendar year in which the adjustments are made and to taxable years beginning in each ensuing calendar year until a calendar year in which a new adjustment is made pursuant to this division. The tax commissioner shall not make a new adjustment in any year in which the amount resulting from the adjustment would be less than the amount resulting from the adjustment in the preceding year. (B) If the director of budget and management makes a certification to the tax commissioner under division (B) of section 131.44 of the Revised Code, the amount of tax as determined under divisions (A)(1) to (3) of this section shall be reduced by the percentage prescribed in that certification for taxable years beginning in the calendar year in which that certification is made. (C) The levy of this tax on income does not prevent a municipal corporation, a joint economic development zone created under section 715.691, or a joint economic development district created under section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Revised Code from levying a tax on income. (D) This division applies only to taxable years of a trust beginning in 2002 or thereafter.

(2) A resident trust may claim a credit against the tax computed under division (D) (C) of this section equal to the lesser of (a) the tax paid to another state or the District of Columbia on the resident trust's modified nonbusiness income, other than the portion of the resident trust's nonbusiness income that is qualifying investment income as defined in section 5747.012 of the Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 276 Revised Code, or (b) the effective tax rate, based on modified Ohio taxable income, multiplied by the resident trust's modified nonbusiness income other than the portion of the resident trust's nonbusiness income that is qualifying investment income. The credit applies before any other applicable credits. (3) The credits authorized by the following sections of the Revised Code do not apply to a trust subject to division (D) of this section: of the Revised Code. Any other credit authorized against the tax imposed by this section applies to a trust subject to division (D) (C) of this section that only if the trust otherwise qualifies for such a the credit. To the extent that the trust distributes income for the taxable year for which a credit is available to the trust, the credit shall be shared by the trust and its beneficiaries. The tax commissioner and the trust shall be guided by applicable regulations of the United States treasury regarding the sharing of credits. (E) (D) For the purposes of this section, \"trust\" means any trust described in Subchapter J of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, excluding trusts that are not irrevocable as defined in division (I)(3)(b) of section 5747.01 of the Revised Code and that have no modified Ohio taxable income for the taxable year, charitable remainder trusts, qualified funeral trusts and preneed funeral contract trusts established pursuant to sections 4717.31 to 4717.38 of the Revised Code that are not qualified funeral trusts, endowment and perpetual care trusts, qualified settlement trusts and funds, designated settlement trusts and funds, and trusts exempted from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

An order requiring weekly or more frequent payments shall be delivered to the employer personally or by certified mail and remains in effect until the commissioner notifies the employer to the contrary. (3) If compelling circumstances exist concerning the remittance of undeposited taxes, the commissioner may order the employer to make payments under any of the payment schedules under division (B) of this section. The order shall be delivered to the employer personally or by certified mail and shall remain in effect until the commissioner notifies the employer to the contrary. For purposes of division (D)(3) of this section, \"compelling circumstances\" exist if either or both of the following are true: (a) Based upon annualization of payments made or required to be made during the preceding calendar year and during the current calendar year, the employer would be required for the next calendar year to make payments under division (B)(2) of this section. (b) Based upon annualization of payments made or required to be made during the current calendar year, the employer would be required for the next calendar year to make payments under division (B)(2) of this section. (E)(1) An employer described in division (B)(1) or (2) of this section shall file, not later than the last day of the month following the end of each calendar quarter, a return covering, but not limited to, both the actual amount deducted and withheld and the amount required to be deducted and Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 280 withheld for the tax imposed under section 5747.02 of the Revised Code during each partial weekly withholding period or portion of a partial weekly withholding period during that quarter.

At the time of filing the return, the employer shall pay any amounts of undeposited taxes for the quarter, whether actually deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld, that have not been previously paid. If required under division (I) of this section, the payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer. The tax commissioner shall prescribe the form and other requirements of the quarterly return. (2) In addition to other returns required to be filed and payments required to be made under this section, every employer required to deduct and withhold taxes shall file, not later than the thirty- first day of January of each year, an annual return covering, but not limited to, both the aggregate amount deducted and withheld and the aggregate amount required to be deducted and withheld during the entire preceding year for the tax imposed under section 5747.02 of the Revised Code and for each tax imposed under Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code. At the time of filing that return, the employer shall pay over any amounts of undeposited taxes for the preceding year, whether actually deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld, that have not been previously paid. The employer shall make the annual report, to each employee and to the tax commissioner, of the compensation paid and each tax withheld, as the commissioner by rule may prescribe. Each employer required to deduct and withhold any tax is liable for the payment of that amount required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not the tax has in fact been withheld, unless the failure to withhold was based upon the employer's good faith in reliance upon the statement of the employee as to liability, and the amount shall be deemed to be a special fund in trust for the general revenue fund. (F) Each employer shall file with the employer's annual return the following items of information on employees for whom withholding is required under section 5747.06 of the Revised Code: (1) The full name of each employee, the employee's address, the employee's school district of residence, and in the case of a nonresident employee, the employee's principal county of employment; (2) The social security number of each employee; (3) The total amount of compensation paid before any deductions to each employee for the period for which the annual return is made; (4) The amount of the tax imposed by section 5747.02 of the Revised Code and the amount of each tax imposed under Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code withheld from the compensation of the employee for the period for which the annual return is made. The commissioner may extend upon good cause the period for filing any notice or return required to be filed under this section and may adopt rules relating to extensions of time. If the extension results in an extension of time for the payment of the amounts withheld with respect to which the return is filed, the employer shall pay, at the time the amount withheld is paid, an amount of interest computed at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code on that amount withheld, from the day that amount was originally required to be paid to the day of actual payment or to the day an assessment is issued under section 5747.13 of the Revised Code, whichever occurs first.Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 281 (5) In addition to all other interest charges and penalties imposed, all amounts of taxes withheld or required to be withheld and remaining unpaid after the day the amounts are required to be paid shall bear interest from the date prescribed for payment at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code on the amount unpaid, in addition to the amount withheld, until paid or until the day an assessment is issued under section 5747.13 of the Revised Code, whichever occurs first. (G) An employee of a corporation, limited liability company, or business trust having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing the report and making payment, or an officer, member, manager, or trustee of a corporation, limited liability company, or business trust who is responsible for the execution of the corporation's, limited liability company's, or business trust's fiscal responsibilities, shall be personally liable for failure to file the report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation, limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge a responsible officer's, member's, manager's, employee's, or trustee's liability for a failure of the corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or pay tax due. (H) If an employer required to deduct and withhold income tax from compensation and to pay that tax to the state under sections 5747.06 and 5747.07 of the Revised Code sells the employer's business or stock of merchandise or quits the employer's business, the taxes required to be deducted and withheld and paid to the state pursuant to those sections prior to that time, together with any interest and penalties imposed on those taxes, become due and payable immediately, and that person shall make a final return within fifteen days after the date of selling or quitting business. The employer's successor shall withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase money to cover the amount of the taxes, interest, and penalties due and unpaid, until the former owner produces a receipt from the tax commissioner showing that the taxes, interest, and penalties have been paid or a certificate indicating that no such taxes are due. If the purchaser of the business or stock of merchandise fails to withhold purchase money, the purchaser shall be personally liable for the payment of the taxes, interest, and penalties accrued and unpaid during the operation of the business by the former owner. If the amount of taxes, interest, and penalties outstanding at the time of the purchase exceeds the total purchase money, the tax commissioner in the commissioner's discretion may adjust the liability of the seller or the responsibility of the purchaser to pay that liability to maximize the collection of withholding tax revenue. (I)(1) An employer described in division (I)(2) of this section whose actual or required payments under this section exceeded eighty-four thousand dollars during the twelve-month period ending on the thirtieth day of June of the preceding calendar year shall make all payments required by this section for the year by electronic funds transfer under section 5747.072 of the Revised Code.

No. 197 133rd G.A. 282 required payments under this section exceeded three hundred thousand dollars during the twelve- month period ending June 30, 1995. (d) For 1997 through 2000, an employer described in division (I)(2) of this section is one whose actual or required payments under this section exceeded one hundred eighty thousand dollars during the twelve-month period ending on the thirtieth day of June of the preceding calendar year. (e) For 2001 and thereafter, an employer described in division (I)(2) of this section is one whose actual or required payments under this section exceeded eighty-four thousand dollars during the twelve-month period ending on the thirtieth day of June of the preceding calendar year.

Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 283 the calendar quarter, a statement of that fact. Sec. 5747.082. (A) As used in this section: (1) \"Electronic technology\" means electronic technology acceptable to the tax commissioner under division (B) of this section. (2) \"Original tax return\" means any report, return, or other tax document required to be filed under this chapter for the purpose of reporting the taxes due under, and withholdings required by, this chapter. \"Original tax return\" does not include an amended return or any declaration or form required by or filed in connection with section 5747.09 of the Revised Code. (3) \"Related member\" has the same meaning as in section 5733.042 of the Revised Code. (4) \"Tax return preparer\" means any person that operates a business that prepares, or directly or indirectly employs another person to prepare, for a taxpayer an original tax return in exchange for compensation or remuneration from the taxpayer or the taxpayer's related member.

(C) A tax return preparer that prepares more than seventy-five original tax returns during any calendar year that ends before January 1, 2013, or that prepares more than eleven original tax returns during any calendar year that begins on or after January 1, 2013, shall use electronic technology to file with the tax commissioner all original tax returns prepared by the tax return preparer. This division does not apply to a tax return preparer in any calendar year that ends before January 1, 2013, if, during the previous calendar year, the tax return preparer prepared no more than twenty-five original tax returns. This division does not apply to a tax return preparer in any calendar year that begins on or after January 1, 2013, if, during the previous calendar year, the tax return preparer prepared not more than ten original tax returns. (D) If a tax return preparer required by this section to submit original tax returns by electronic technology files an original tax return by some means other than by electronic technology, the tax commissioner shall impose a penalty of fifty dollars for each return , in excess of seventy-five in calendar year 2010, 2011, or 2012, or in excess of eleven in any calendar year thereafter, that is not filed by electronic technology. Upon good cause shown by the tax return preparer, the tax commissioner may waive all or any portion of the penalty or may refund all or any portion of the Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 284 penalty the tax return preparer has paid. Sec. 5747.11. (A) The tax commissioner shall refund to employers, qualifying entities, or taxpayers subject to a tax imposed under section 5733.41, 5747.02, or 5747.41, or Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code the amount of any overpayment of such tax. (B) Except as otherwise provided under divisions (D) and (E) of this section, applications for refund shall be filed with the tax commissioner, on the form prescribed by the commissioner, within four years from the date of the illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period allowed by division (B)(3)(b) of section 5747.05, division (E) of section 5747.10, division (A) of section 5747.13, or division (C) of section 5747.45 of the Revised Code. On filing of the refund application, the commissioner shall determine the amount of refund due and, if that amount exceeds one dollar, certify such amount to the director of budget and management and treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund created by section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. Payment shall be made as provided in division (C) of section 126.35 of the Revised Code. (C)(1) Interest shall be allowed and paid at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code on amounts refunded with respect to the tax imposed under section 5747.02 or Chapter 5748. of the Revised Code from the date of the overpayment until the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or ninety days after the return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall be allowed on such overpayment. If the overpayment results from the carryback of a net operating loss or net capital loss to a previous taxable year, the overpayment is deemed not to have been made prior to the filing date, including any extension thereof, for the taxable year in which the net operating loss or net capital loss arises. For purposes of the payment of interest on overpayments, no amount of tax, for any taxable year, shall be treated as having been paid before the date on which the tax return for that year was due without regard to any extension of time for filing such return. (2) Interest shall be allowed at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code on amounts refunded with respect to the taxes imposed under sections 5733.41 and 5747.41 of the Revised Code. The interest shall run from whichever of the following days is the latest until the day the refund is paid: the day the illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment was made; the ninetieth day after the final day the annual report was required to be filed under section 5747.42 of the Revised Code; or the ninetieth day after the day that report was filed. (D) \"Ninety days\" shall be substituted for \"four years\" in division (B) of this section if the taxpayer satisfies both of the following conditions: (1) The taxpayer has applied for a refund based in whole or in part upon section 5747.059 of the Revised Code; (2) The taxpayer asserts that either the imposition or collection of the tax imposed or charged by this chapter or any portion of such tax violates the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of Ohio. (E)(1) Division (E)(2) of this section applies only if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (a) A qualifying entity pays an amount of the tax imposed by section 5733.41 or 5747.41 of the Revised Code;Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 285 (b) The taxpayer is a qualifying investor as to that qualifying entity; (c) The taxpayer did not claim the credit provided for in section 5747.059 of the Revised Code as to the tax described in division (E)(1)(a) of this section; (d) The four-year period described in division (B) of this section has ended as to the taxable year for which the taxpayer otherwise would have claimed that credit. (2) A taxpayer shall file an application for refund pursuant to division (E) of this section within one year after the date the payment described in division (E)(1)(a) of this section is made. An application filed under division (E)(2) of this section shall claim refund only of overpayments resulting from the taxpayer's failure to claim the credit described in division (E)(1)(c) of this section. Nothing in division (E) of this section shall be construed to relieve a taxpayer from complying with division (A)(16) (A)(15) of section 5747.01 of the Revised Code. Sec. 5747.231. As used in this section, \"adjusted qualifying amount\" has the same meaning as in section 5733.40 of the Revised Code. This section does not apply to division (BB)(AA)(5)(a)(ii) of section 5747.01 of the Revised Code. Except as set forth in this section and except as otherwise provided in divisions (A) and (B) of section 5733.401 of the Revised Code, in making all apportionment, allocation, income, gain, loss, deduction, tax, and credit computations under this chapter, each person shall include in that person's items of business income, nonbusiness income, adjusted qualifying amounts, allocable income or loss, apportionable income or loss, property, compensation, and sales, the person's entire distributive share or proportionate share of the items of business income, nonbusiness income, adjusted qualifying amounts, allocable income or loss, apportionable income or loss, property, compensation, and sales of any pass-through entity in which the person has a direct or indirect ownership interest at any time during the person's taxable year. A pass-through entity's direct or indirect distributive share or proportionate share of any other pass-through entity's items of business income, nonbusiness income, adjusted qualifying amounts, allocable income or loss, apportionable income or loss, property, compensation, and sales shall be included for the purposes of computing the person's distributive share or proportionate share of the pass-through entity's items of business income, nonbusiness income, adjusted qualifying amounts, allocable income or loss, apportionable income or loss, property, compensation, and sales under this section. Those items shall be in the same form as was recognized by the pass-through entity. Sec. 5747.41. For the same purposes for which the tax is levied under section 5747.02 of the Revised Code, there is hereby levied a withholding tax on every qualifying pass-through entity having at least one qualifying investor who is an individual and on every qualifying trust having at least one qualifying beneficiary who is an individual. The withholding tax imposed by this section is imposed on the sum of the adjusted qualifying amounts of a qualifying pass-through entity's qualifying investors who are individuals and on the sum of the adjusted qualifying amounts of a qualifying trust's qualifying beneficiaries, at the rate of five per cent of that sum. The tax imposed by this section applies only if the qualifying entity has nexus with this state under the Constitution of the United States for any portion of the qualifying entity's qualifying taxable year, and the sum of the qualifying entity's adjusted qualifying amounts exceeds one thousand dollars for the qualifying entity's qualifying taxable year.Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 286 The levy of the tax under this section does not prevent a municipal corporation or a joint economic development district created under section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Revised Code from levying a tax on income. Sec. 5747.51. (A) On or before the twenty-fifth day of July of each year, the tax commissioner shall make and certify to the county auditor of each county an estimate of the amount of the local government fund to be allocated to the undivided local government fund of each county for the ensuing calendar year, adjusting the total as required to account for subdivisions receiving local government funds under section 5747.502 of the Revised Code. (B) At each annual regular session of the county budget commission convened pursuant to section 5705.27 of the Revised Code, each auditor shall present to the commission the certificate of the commissioner, the annual tax budget and estimates, and the records showing the action of the commission in its last preceding regular session. The commission, after extending to the representatives of each subdivision an opportunity to be heard, under oath administered by any member of the commission, and considering all the facts and information presented to it by the auditor, shall determine the amount of the undivided local government fund needed by and to be apportioned to each subdivision for current operating expenses, as shown in the tax budget of the subdivision. This determination shall be made pursuant to divisions (C) to (I) of this section, unless the commission has provided for a formula pursuant to section 5747.53 of the Revised Code. The commissioner shall reduce the amount of funds from the undivided local government fund to a subdivision required to receive reduced funds under section 5747.502 of the Revised Code. Nothing in this section prevents the budget commission, for the purpose of apportioning the undivided local government fund, from inquiring into the claimed needs of any subdivision as stated in its tax budget, or from adjusting claimed needs to reflect actual needs. For the purposes of this section, \"current operating expenses\" means the lawful expenditures of a subdivision, except those for permanent improvements and except payments for interest, sinking fund, and retirement of bonds, notes, and certificates of indebtedness of the subdivision. (C) The commission shall determine the combined total of the estimated expenditures, including transfers, from the general fund and any special funds other than special funds established for road and bridge; street construction, maintenance, and repair; state highway improvement; and gas, water, sewer, and electric public utilities operated by a subdivision, as shown in the subdivision's tax budget for the ensuing calendar year. (D) From the combined total of expenditures calculated pursuant to division (C) of this section, the commission shall deduct the following expenditures, if included in these funds in the tax budget: (1) Expenditures for permanent improvements as defined in division (E) of section 5705.01 of the Revised Code; (2) In the case of counties and townships, transfers to the road and bridge fund, and in the case of municipalities, transfers to the street construction, maintenance, and repair fund and the state highway improvement fund; (3) Expenditures for the payment of debt charges; (4) Expenditures for the payment of judgments. (E) In addition to the deductions made pursuant to division (D) of this section, revenues Am. Sub. H. B. No. 197 133rd G.A. 287 accruing to the general fund and any special fund considered under division (C) of this section from the following sources shall be deducted from the combined total of expenditures calculated pursuant to division (C) of this section: (1) Taxes levied within the ten-mill limitation, as defined in section 5705.02 of the Revised Code; (2) The budget commission allocation of estimated county public library fund revenues to be distributed pursuant to section 5747.48 of the Revised Code; (3) Estimated unencumbered balances as shown on the tax budget as of the thirty-first day of December of the current year in the general fund, but not any estimated balance in any special fund considered in division (C) of this section; (4) Revenue, including transfers, shown in the general fund and any special funds other than special funds established for road and bridge; street construction, maintenance, and repair; state highway improvement; and gas, water, sewer, and electric public utilities, from all other sources except those that a subdivision receives from an additional tax or service charge voted by its electorate or receives from special assessment or revenue bond collection. For the purposes of this division, where the charter of a municipal corporation prohibits the levy of an income tax, an income tax levied by the legislative authority of such municipal corporation pursuant to an amendment of the charter of that municipal corporation to authorize such a levy represents an additional tax voted by the electorate of that municipal corporation. For the purposes of this division, any measure adopted by a board of county commissioners pursuant to section 322.02, 4504.02, or 5739.021 of the Revised Code, including those measures upheld by the electorate in a referendum conducted pursuant to section 322.021, 4504.021, or 5739.022 of the Revised Code, shall not be considered an additional tax voted by the electorate. Subject to division (G) (F) of section 5705.29 of the Revised Code, money in a reserve balance account established by a county, township, or municipal corporation under section 5705.13 of the Revised Code shall not be considered an unencumbered balance or revenue under division (E) (3) or (4) of this section. Money in a reserve balance account established by a township under section 5705.132 of the Revised Code shall not be considered an unencumbered balance or revenue under division (E)(3) or (4) of this section. If a county, township, or municipal corporation has created and maintains a nonexpendable trust fund under section 5705.131 of the Revised Code, the principal of the fund, and any additions to the principal arising from sources other than the reinvestment of investment earnings arising from such a fund, shall not be considered an unencumbered balance or revenue under division (E)(3) or (4) of this section. Only investment earnings arising from investment of the principal or investment of such additions to principal may be considered an unencumbered balance or revenue under those divisions. (F) The total expenditures calculated pursuant to division (C) of this section, less the deductions authorized in divisions (D) and (E) of this section, shall be known as the \"relative need\" of the subdivision, for the purposes of this section. (G) The budget commission shall total the relative need of all participating subdivisions in the county, and shall compute a relative need factor by dividing the total estimate of the undivided local government fund by the total relative need of all participating subdivisions. Am. Sub. H. B.
