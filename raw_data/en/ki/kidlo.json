[Your Business Model & Funding](#) What is your business model? When considering a business model for a company offering a solution like the one proposed in the MIT Solve example, it's important to take into account both the impact on the population served and the revenue generated. Assuming a fee of $100 for each lung cancer scan, and 10,000 scans conducted per year in Chennai, the revenue generated by the solution would be $1 million per year. This revenue can be used to cover the costs associated with running the solution, including equipment maintenance, salaries, and overheads. Assuming these costs total $600,000 per year, the profit generated by the solution would be $400,000 per year ($1 million revenue - $600,000 costs). However, it's important to note that a social impact-driven model is not solely focused on profit. The lung cancer detection solution could offer subsidies or discounts to low-income patients, partner with hospitals or NGOs to provide the service, or offer free scans for public health campaigns. By doing so, the revenue generated may be lower, but the social impact and accessibility of the solution would be higher. One potential business model could involve partnering with hospitals or clinics in Chennai and charging them a fee for each scan conducted. The hospital or clinic would then bill the patient directly for the service. This would allow the solution to be integrated into existing healthcare systems and ensure that patients have access to the service through established channels. Another potential model could involve partnering with NGOs or public health organizations to conduct free or discounted scans for underserved communities. This would increase the accessibility of the solution and help to address health disparities in the population served. In terms of revenue streams, the lung cancer detection solution could also explore additional services or products that complement the scan, such as personalized treatment plans or access to clinical trials. This could provide additional revenue and create a more comprehensive solution for patients. It's important to consider the potential challenges in implementing a business model for a solution like this. For example, there may be regulatory or legal barriers to charging fees for medical services or partnering with healthcare organizations. Additionally, there may be cultural or logistical challenges in establishing trust and adoption of the solution in the population served. Overall, a successful business model for this solution would prioritize both social impact and financial sustainability. By leveraging partnerships, subsidies, and additional revenue streams, the solution can be made accessible to those who need it most while also generating the resources necessary to sustain and scale the solution over time. Do you primarily provide products or services directly to individuals, to other organizations, or to the government?Individual consumers or stakeholders (B2C) What is your plan for becoming financially sustainable?
