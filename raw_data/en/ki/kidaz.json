With the goal of educating and empowering parents, they discuss some common remedies that reduce brain inflammation, how to dose them, and how to prepare and center yourself as the parent so that you can manage the flare effectively. Of course the ultimate goal of homeopathic treatment is that these episodes will happen less intensely and less frequently as the child heals from their autoimmune condition. In the meantime, parents can be prepared to handle these curves in the road to healing and nip flares in the bud. --- "}
