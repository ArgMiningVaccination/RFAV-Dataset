AbstractKombucha tea is highly fermented beverage popularly consumed in many countries. The aim was to evaluate the possible protective effects of the usage of Kombucha as natural agent against the stressful effects resulted from administration of high sucrose diet to male rabbits through determination of some biochemical parameters. The results demonstrated that pretreatment with Kombucha tea in high sucrose stressed rabbit significantly improve lipid profile and antioxidant system meanwhile significant reduction of glucose, urea, creatinine, cupper and non significant change in testosterone and copper levels. In conclusion, Kombucha tea was able to ameliorate serum biochemical parameters in high sucrose stressed rabbits mediated by antioxidant and lipotropic properties.
