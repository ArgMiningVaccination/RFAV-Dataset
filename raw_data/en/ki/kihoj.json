Education // Wellbeing // Community Welcome To the worldwide movement of anthroposophic initiatives in the field of disabilities, education, social pedagogy and social work. Member organizations from more than 50 countries are working together under the umbrella of the Council. Together, we are striving to contribute to a 21st century world in which a good life is possible for all human beings. Our work focuses on situations where persons are at risk of being excluded from access to education, health and social participation because of a disability or social circumstances. This means that we see our task on the one hand in supporting the individual on his or her biographical path, and on the other hand in creating social spaces in which this individual path can move and unfold.
