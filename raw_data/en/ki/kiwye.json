One politician [said](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/gaumutra-gobar-may-cure-coronavirus-says-assam-bjp-mla-suman-haripriya-in-assembly-2188694) cow urine and dung \"may cure coronavirus\". Doctors [pointed out](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-doctors-warn-against-cow-dung-covid-cure-2021-05-11/) these practices were dangerous. Many poor and marginalised people, who often view the state and its agencies as hostile entities, have absorbed misinformation to fuel conspiracy views. \"Aap ka tika sahi hai, ho jayenge\" ('The vaccine for you people is fine but for us it has poison, which will finish the poor') said one. One [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.08.21256879v1.full) suggests India is the most misinformation-affected country, and yet public agencies in India performed very poorly in addressing any specific items of misinformation. They could do better \u2014 and have done when it comes to combating polio. Instead, sudden lockdowns \u2014 which took a terrible physical toll and resulted in severe economic losses for migrant workers \u2014 only enhanced the sense of mistrust and alienation these social segments carry against \"authorities\". Feelings of abandonment deepened after the deadly second wave of Covid-19 infections led to many [deaths](https://thewire.in/rights/the-floating-dead-dignity-unequality) not just from the disease itself but the horrendous lack of access to medical infrastructure and services. People from more privileged social classes also fell victim to misinformation, particularly when it had a [\"ring of science\"](https://www.bbc.com/news/54893437) to it. Among the urban myths: Indians live in a dirty environment so their immune system is good enough; vaccines require years of research so how can the current ones be effective, or even safe. Government agencies \u2014 especially health-related ones \u2014 were slow putting genuine information into the public sphere, the resulting information vacuum filled with misinformation. Breakthrough infections were cited as evidence of the vaccines' ineffectiveness; fake journals helped push pseudoscience. A general lack of scientific literacy meant many were unable to distinguish between the science of vaccines and the profit-hungry behavior of pharma companies. Evidence about hospitals [fleecing patients](https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/navi-mumbai-nmmc-receives-over-1100-complaints-of-inflated-medical-bills-for-covid-19-treatment) helped give rise to a deep notion that vaccines are just money making and unnecessary products for corporations acting in collusion with governments. Government bodies have been very reluctant in sharing information even with researchers who had to [beseech](https://www.science.org/content/article/there-are-so-many-hurdles-indian-scientists-plead-government-unlock-covid-19-data) the prime minister to get access to data needed for research, especially relating to regional and national scenarios - a situation that still [prevails](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/reflections-on-flying-blind-into-the-storm/article37972218.ece) today. The [ Covaxin vaccine development saga](https://science.thewire.in/health/icmr-balram-bhargava-covaxin-clinical-trials-bharat-biotech-politics/) only reduced government credibility. Then came the persistent denials by various administrations, at all levels, about deaths resulting from a lack of [hospital beds](https://thebaffler.com/latest/how-it-feels-dastidar), [oxygen](https://science.thewire.in/health/178-covid-patients-died-in-india-because-of-oxygen-shortage-in-recent-weeks/) and drugs during the second Covid-19 wave. This despite all the [images](https://science.thewire.in/health/bodies-float-down-the-ganga-as-nearly-4000-more-die-of-covid-19-in-india/) and reports of the horrendous pain and death this wave wrought in India. Some public agencies continued to promote Ayurveda, leading to advertising of an ayurvedic polyherbal concoction [Ayush64](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1715849) as a cure/immune booster. One such remedy got the [blessings](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/indian-medical-association-explanation-health-minister-promoting-patanjalis-coronil-7199236/) of the health minister, along with [false claims](https://science.thewire.in/health/fact-check-patanjalis-coronil-neither-who-certified-nor-approved/) of being approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). Little has been done to counter the resulting vaccine [hesitancy problem](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/11-5-crore-indian-adults-currently-hesitant-to-take-covid-vaccine-survey/articleshow/87850635.cms). The Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) has a communications [strategy document](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Covid19CommunicationStrategy2020.pdf), but nothing significant seems to have been put into practice. Public service announcements, on any media \u2014 print or television \u2014 are scarce, mostly seen when government milestones are met and delivered in self-congratulatory tones. The advertisements that have appeared, such as \"Tika Ka\" [Jab of Victory] Afraid of Corona, Not Vaccinations\" (Delhi government), hardly have any \"recall\". Some private entities like Google have been active in putting out public service [messages](https://www.campaignasia.com/video/google-vaccine-ad-is-a-hopeful-look-at-post-pandemic-life/468785) about Covid-19 vaccines; including [targeted television advertisements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8-SI5XLjS8). India has shown it can design public service advertisements conveying meaningful messages \u2014 it did so for anti-tobacco campaigns. To help counter polio it turned to [celebrity endorsements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruj-HRWrlEg) and [catchy taglines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHf6joKdCHk). It could also look to public service campaigns launched in other countries: \" [It's Up To You](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2021/04/26/coronavirus-vaccines-ad-council/)\" and \" [We Can Do This](https://www.ehstoday.com/covid19/article/21158381/new-ad-campaign-encourages-americans-to-get-covid19-vaccines)\" in the United States and \" [Every Vaccine Give Us Hope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTqh8K2Ux4c)\" in the United Kingdom. India's own public agencies \u2014 the science and technology related government departments as well as the scholarly scientific academies \u2014 could emulate the educational activities of the US National Academies of Science, Engineering, Medicine. The US Center for Disease Control also hosts [videos](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/videos.html?Sort=Date%3A%3Adesc), and multilingual [public service announcements](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/communication/public-service-announcements.html) delivering resources many non-experts can access. Some states of India have [turned to folk music and street plays](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-vaccine-hesitancy-covid-inoculation-drive-7355171/) to spread Covid-19 related awareness. Backed up with billboards, posters and public announcements it could be enough to energise people to \"do something\" about getting the vaccine.
