An Emergency Use Authorization is allowed in instan ces where a public health threat is identified, and there are no approved or adeq uate existing products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) carefully reviews all safety data from clinical trials and au thorizes emergency vaccine use only when the expected benefits outweigh potential risks.

Retrieved from www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood- biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained Am I better off getting COVID-19 instead of getting the vaccine? Studies show COVID-19 vaccines are safe and very effective. COVID-19 can have serious, life- threatening complications, and there is no way to predict how COVID-19 will affect a person. It is unknown whether getting COVID-19 protects you from getting the virus again or how long natural immunity lasts. Additionally, when you become infected with the virus, you risk transmitting it to the people around you. Source: CDC. (2021). Answering Pati ents' Questions.

The FDA and CDC are continuing the monitor the safety of the vaccine to identify any possible long- term side effects. The CDC's committee charged with evaluating vaccine safety data will take action to address any safety issu es that are identified.

The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS ) is a national monitoring system that tracks people's physical reactions after getting the shot. Healthcare workers and vaccine manufacturers are required to report adverse events that occur after vaccination in VA ERS. V-safe is a new smartphone- based health monitoring system for people who receive the COVID -19 vaccine. V-safe uses text messaging and web surveys to prov ide check-ins with COVID-19 vaccine recipients. They will call to follow-up with anyone who report s a significant bad reaction. A VA ERS report will be taken during follow-up if appropriate. Source: CDC. (2021). Ensuring the Safety of COVI D-19 Vaccines in the United States.

The Johnson and Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 vacci ne differs from other COVID-19 vaccines, because it uses an adenovirus instead of mRNA to stimulate the body's natural immune response. You might be familiar with adenoviruses if you've had the common cold. Adenovirus vaccines use a modified version of a different viru s as a vector to deliver instructions for making the spike protein found on the surface of the COVID- 19 virus. The genetic material de livered by the adenovirus does not enter the cell nucleus and does not integrate into a person's DNA. Viral vectors, such as adenoviruses, have been used in vaccines since the 1970s against a number of infectious diseases including influenza, Zika Virus, and Ebola. Source: CDC. (2021).

The vaccine cannot give someone COVID-19, because it does not contain th e COVID-19 virus. Side effects can occur with any vaccine.

If I have already had COVID-19, how long do I need to wait to get the COVID-19 Vaccine? If you previously had a COVID-19 infection, you can receive the COVID-19 vaccine. People with a current COVID-19 infection should wait until they ha ve recovered from the illn ess and their isolation period is over to get the vaccine. If you received monoclonal antibodi es or convalescent plasma as part of COVID-19 treatment, it is recommended that you wait 90 days before vaccination. If you did not receive any of these treatments for a COVID -19 infection, there is no recommended minimum amount of time between in fection and vaccination. Source CDC. (2021).
