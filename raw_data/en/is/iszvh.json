Measured By: Pre and Post surveys of student opinions; Interviews: one -on-one; s tudent product (e.g., portfolio, journal) rated without rubric interviews Results: Filming Intramural Basketball games allowed us to create a specific YouTube channel for referees to access their game film. We were able to breakdown film from 10 games, which included 15 unique referees. In subsequent interview follow -up, when asked about their confidence level before watching their game film compared to after, all 15 referees agreed they felt more confident going into their next work shift. They felt that through watching their abilities, mannerisms and communication with participan ts, they felt more prepared to handle difficult situations that could arise in the future. All 15 referees were able to diagnose three ways to improve their overall management of an Intramural Sports game, many of them citing \"to be more proactive in appro aching a participant who appears to be losing control.\" All referees felt they learned mediation skills that were transferable \"life skills,\" and 9 referees were able to analyze a personal/social situation where they directly put into use these skills learned from refereeing .

UC IRVINE SAFE CAMPUS ANTI-VIOLENCE PROJECT Violence prevention activities funded by the Department of Justice, Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) Campus Safety Grant continued through the end of December 2017. The CARE office continued to provide an integrated, multi -dimen sional initiative to expand services to students who were survivors of sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, and stalking. These services included crisis intervention, Victim Advocates who were available 24/7, group counseling, medical care, invest igation of policy violations and criminal acts, protective orders, consultation with housing and academic units, accompaniment, education and a holistic healing program for survivo rs. Collaborative partnerships with on and off -campus agencies and the ongoi ng meetings of the Coordinated Community Review (CCR) Team ensured comprehensive support of all victims' needs. The OVW Campus grant provided important resources to build upon existing strengths and successes in our ongoing implementation of the four minim um requirements: 1) establishment and continued training of a CCR team, 2) design and implementation of a mandatory prevention education program, 3) specialized training of campus police, and 4) training for campus disciplinary boards. UCI CARE completed t he third and final year of the 2014- 17 renewal grant from OVW and were awarded another 3 -year OVW Campus grant for 2 017-2 0. OVW grant funds supported 50% of the full -time UCI Victim Advocate position in the CARE office through the end of 2017. The Office of the President for the UC system has recognized Advocacy as a critical service for students and has made campus -sourced funding for CARE Advocate positions a requirement on all UC campuses. At the close of the 2014 -17 Campus Grant, the UCI Advocate posi tion was becoming 100% institutionally supported. The Campus grant also continued funding the Green Dot Bystander Intervention program and the continued activities of our Holistic Healing program for those students affected by sexual violence. This past year, our holistic healing program services have included our signature trauma informed Yoga As Healing program, art, music, horticulture, journaling, touchstones, aromatherapy and personal safety and self-defense workshops for students. T h e C A R E o f f i c e o v ersees all projects, including incoming student orientation planning and providing expertise and time in the implementation of law enforcement and student conduct trainin gs. In addition, the CARE office contributes directly to the development of t he Case M anagement Team (CMT). The CARE office is committed to cross campus collaboration which is demonstrated through the valuable partnerships, trainings and programs that take place both on campus and in the local community.

The UCI campus was awarded a third renewal grant by OVW for the period 2017- 20. As a recipient of a third, three -year (2017 -20) Department of Justice, Office on Viol ence Against Women (OVW) Campus Safety Grant, violence prevention activities on the UC Irvine campus are ongoing. The UCI CARE office continues to provide an integrated, multi -dimensional initiative to expand services to students who were survivors of sexu al assault, dating and domestic violence, and stalking.

VISION & MISSION VISION To be a leader in collegiate health promotion by focusing on the unique and relevant health nee ds and concerns of UCI students in support of their academic success. MISSION We empower students to make informe d decisions t hat support individual health and a healthy campus environment by providing comprehensive programs and coordinated services to: Build awareness through assessment and goal -setting Create balance by taking a wellness -based approach to health Develop healthy and sustainable habits Take pride in achieving one's personal best Inspire community by leading fellow Anteaters to be healthy CORE VALUES Advocacy Awareness Empowerment VALUES The mission of the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotio n is upheld by utilizing our expertise in innovative and relevant programming to the UCI community. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion (CSWHP) focuses on health topic areas identified through various assessment efforts. Our programs are unique in their abilities to meet the students in the spaces where they are most comfortable, in order to tackle issues that can be sensitive in nature. Our programming is often facilitated in residence halls, organizational meetings and other safe spaces for students. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion is the only department on campus that houses full -time health promotion staff to focus on issues that are integral to college health and wellness , such as alcohol and other drugs, sexual and relationship health, general wellness and life balance , nutrition and mental health. Part of our mission is to facilitate student development and leadership opportunities. With the continued growth and development of the Publi c Health program on campus, the CSWHP has become a natural partne r with students in this major. We provide the only opportunity on campus for these students to become involved with health promotion on a college campus. Many students in public health, social ecology, pre-medical and dental programs flock to the CSWHP to find ways to become involved on campus and in the community. With stress, anxiety, sleep and other related mental health concerns being reported by students as some o f t h e m o s t c o m m o n b a r r i e r s t o t h e i r a c a d e m i c s u c c e s s , t h e Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion made a commitment to a dedicated space for students to address these concerns. Various relaxation and stress -reduction techniques ar e taught through our workshops to help manage the various forms of stress in their lives. Alcohol and other drug use can be another barrier students experie nce to their academic success. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion is a primary referral source for students who may h ave challenges in these areas. Our trained staff provide s services including a weekly Alcohol Awareness Class, WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students (BASICS), individual consultations for other drugs and smoking cessation support. These services are intended as early interv ention techniques and strategies to ensure students are successful in pursuit of their academic and personal goals. The CSWHP is also the only provider of free condoms, both male and female, lube and dental dams on the UCI campus. The Cond om Co- Op was fou nded in 2011 -12 and provides education and information about safe r sex, as well as ensuring that accessibility to condoms do es not become a barrier to practicing safer sex. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion is also the only place on campu s that p rovide s free and anonymous HIV testing for the UCI community. The UCI community can be tested without fear of their results being tied to their identity. In an effort to be as inclusive as possible to the various needs of the campus, the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion also offers two unique resources. For nursing mothers, the C SWHP is one of three locations on campus that offe rs a private Lactation Station. This space provides nursing mothers with a private space to breast feed or pum p and is attached to a private bathroom . That private bathroom also serves as the second resource : a gender -neutral restroom. This allows members of the campus community who prefer a gender -neutral restroom option to have it available in a safe and private locat ion. II.

HIV continues to be highly stigmatized and feared so providing an environment where students can feel safe, comfortable and learn about the importance of testing is crucial. Students receive their results in 20 minutes using the Federally -approved Oraquick In -Home HIV Testing kit and receive important information on the importance of other STI screenings, establishing a well -care program while at UCI and discussing healthy sexual and relationship behaviors and practices. The budget for HIV kits during the 2017- 18 year was 78 and 77 were used. In order to conserve the kits throughout the year for students who were at higher risk, referrals for HIV and other STIs were made to the Student Health Center, private insurances and community partners. The Condom Co -Op continues to be a popular and need ed service and accounts for a significant number of visits to the CSWHP (3,851 students). Students can access up to 10 free internal and external condoms and 5 lubes daily. The CSWHP provides a wide array of male condoms, female condoms and dental dams to meet the needs of the students. Approximately 39,343 condoms and dental dams were distributed to students and another 500 were donated to campus partners this year. 75 3064 22 22 SEXUAL HEALTH AOD NUTRITION EMOTIONAL WELLNESSWELLNESSNumber of Consultations Program AreaConsultations 2017 -18WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion facilitates and participat es in a variety of workshops and programs on the UCI campus, independently and collaboratively with many campus partners/departments and student organizations like ASUCI, Active Minds and the Public Health Association. These opportunities allow the department to broaden its reach and to meet the diversity and needs of UCI's undergraduate and graduate students. The focus of these efforts is to provide students with accurate and important health information, encourage and promote healthy behaviors and lifesty les, and provide students with resources and referrals to on and off campus partners and organizations to support their overall health and wellness needs. CSWHP provided the UCI community with 141 unique events throughout the year from annual events like the Zot Health Fair and Spring Fever to resource and leadership fairs to topic specific awareness events.

Every staff member from the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion participates in at least one community coalition and/or task force. Several staff members also participate on the Healthy Campus Initiativ e workgroups (Sexual Health, Nutrition and AOD). The CSWHP has a robust Peer Health Education and Internship Program, in addition to accepting volunteers to assist with la rge-scale events. During the 2017 -18 year, a total of 30 Peer Health Educators and 15 internship students were trained and supervised to assist the CSWHP with programming, services, promotion a nd outreach to the UCI campus. The Peer Health Educators work with the Center for an entire academic year. The CSHWP is also a field study/pract icum site for the Program in Public Health and the Social Ecology. Students intern for one quarter, many of whom continue to volunteer after their internship. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion has included outreach efforts to graduate st udents. All major events, such as the Zot Health Fair, Spring Fever, Sex Week @ UCI and De -Stress Fest were shared with Graduate Housing to encourage them to attend. Both the Wellness and Peer Health Education Manager and the Sexual & Relationship Health Program Manager participated in the PharmSci Department's Self- Care Fridays. All in all, CSWHP reached 29,243 students with some form of in -person contact with the various programs and services offered. An additional 9,623 students were reached through C SWHP's online programs and resources. This includes 9,623 who completed the FIRST (First -year Internet Required Safety Training) module on alcohol, which is required of all first- year and transfer students; 224 students who completed the E -Chug online alcohol assessment module (required of all alcohol referrals, but also available to any student to take); and 40 students who completed the E -Toke online marijuana assessment module (required of all marijuana referrals, but also avai lable to any student to tak e). This brings the total reach to 38,866 students. 2841814751382491544033365025190 0 100 200 300 400 500Sex Week @ UCISexual HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION V. HISTORY The catalyst for Health Education was a CPR training program started in Student Health Services in the mid -1980s. Dr. Gerry Sinikin also supported a peer education program that sponsored an annu al health fair for students. Dr. Sinikin funded the fairs for many years as he chaired the Irvine Health Foundation. G r e e k A d v i s o r E l l e n R e i b l i n g w a s a w a r d e d o n e o f t h e f i r s t Fund for the Improvement of Post- Secondary Education (FIPSE ) grants for alcohol p revention programs in 1987. At the same time, David Souleles was developing an HIV/AIDS Education program for the Dean of Students Office. They joined forces in 1990 and opened Health Education in the Gateway Building adjacent to Aldrich Park. Thomas Parha m, Assistant Vice Chancellor, established the department as independent in 1994 when the Counseling and Health Services Cluster was formed and named Ellen Reibling the first director. The department moved into an expanded area when the Phase IV Student Cen ter renovation was completed in Fall 2008. The number of career positions has grown from 2.5 FTE to as many as 8 .0 FTE and is currently at 6.10 FTE. The department has sponsored an annual health fair since 1994. Health Education was awarded two regional di ssemination grants in the early 1990s to help other campuses establish alcohol prevention programs, providing consultations to CSU Fullerton, CSU Long Beach, Loyola Marymount, UC Riverside and University of La Verne before their programs were established. The department also distributed a student publication called the \"Project Aware Resource Bin \" which sold more than 200 copies. UCI Health Education hosted one regional and two national prev ention meetings in the mid 1990 s and this tradition continues today . Peer education programs have been offered for academic credit from Education, Social Ecology and Social Sciences with emphasis on alcohol (Students to Enhance Peer Sobriety or STEPS) and general health (Community Peer Health Educators). The Center for St udent Wellness & Health Promotion now has its own formal Peer Educator program, managed by our Wellness & Pe er Education Programs Manager. The program consists of three topic -based groups: Alcohol and Other Drugs (AOD), Sexual Health, and Wellness. The department has also supported four student organizations: IMAGE (Body image awareness), START (Tobacco), RADD Crew (alcohol education and DUI prevention) and Active Minds (emotional health). The department has been significantly supported by grants throughou t its history . Funders have included US Department of Education (FIPSE and Office of Safe and Drug Free Schools), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA ), National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), California Office of Traffic Safet y, California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, Irvine Health Foundat ion, Community Alliance Network and Califo rnia Tobacco Control Section. For many years, Health Education hosted AIDS Walk Orange County and was the only prevention organization receiving an annual grant allocation. In June 2015, after celebrating its 25 th Anniversary as the Health Education Center, the department officially changed its name to the Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion in order to align itself with American College Health Association (ACHA ) and Council for the Advancement of Standards in Higher Education (CAS) standards and guidelines , and the field of health promotion in general. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion continues to be a national l eader in hosting regional and national events. In February of 2013, we hosted the California Statewide Wellness & Health Promotion Directors meeting. In November 2015, the campus hosted the national Active Minds College Mental Health Conference due to the success of o ur campus Active Minds Chapter. In May of 2016, the campus hosted the national Step Up! Bystander Facilitator Training Conference. VI. LOCATION G319 Student Center South ZOT: 6125 WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION The department moved into this expanded area when the Phase IV Stude nt Center renovation was completed in fa l l 2 0 0 8 a n d n o w s h a r e s s o m e s p a c e w i t h CARE (Campus Assault Resources & Educ ation) as of fall 2011. The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion is located on the same floor as k ey Student Affairs departments i ncluding Student Life & Leadership; the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual (LGBT) Resource Center; International Student Center; Veteran Services; and Hospitality & Dining Services. This strengthens our ability to serve students' needs as well as effec tively partner with colleagues on projects and initiatives. VII. ASSETS Major facilities, technologies and equipment The Center for Student Wellness & Health Promotion occupies approximately 2 ,000 sq . ft. of space including approximately 900 sq. ft. of office s pace, 520 sq. ft. of student work space (shared with CARE) , 220 sq. ft. conference room (shared with CARE) , 200 sq. ft. of reception/lobby area , 120 sq . ft. storage room , and 85 sq. ft. consultation room (Lactation Station and other private consultations). TECHNOLOGY Computers, digital displays, camera/video equipment, audience -response clicker system/software and other basic technology equip ment EQUIPMENT The only equipment asset for CSWHP, based on the $10,000 value mark, is our golf cart, which is requir ed to haul programming and outreach supplies/equipment to the various programs and activities that we provide for the campus. VIII. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS The campus First -year Internet Required Safety Training (FIRST) module, an alcohol/sexual assault training required for all first -year and transfer students to UCI. This is a shared responsibility with CARE . We actively participate in the coordination of compliance with the federal Drug -Free Schools and Communities Act, collecting and providing data and feedb ack on the student side of the requirement. We also do an annual review of relevant areas (primarily AOD) of the campus Clery/ASR report. For a complete list of Student Affairs mandates, please refer to the Appendix. IX. ADVISORY COMMITTEE Not applicable X. MAJO R ISSUES Budget cuts to Health Education since 2002 c ontinue to be a major concern. Our entire permanent funds budget was essentially cut in 2011- 12, as part of the Student Affairs budget plan, although the funding was back -filled with funding from Student Heal th Center (via VCSA/AVC WHCS). However, this funding only covers our current staff salari es and benefits and does not provide any funds for casual staff, student staff, professional development/training or programming. We have been able to secure some SFAC support over the last few years (a total of $16,000 to support various programming efforts, 50% of the Wellness & Peer Education Program Manager position, and the 25% portion of the Registered Dietitian position). Temporary allocations, voluntary red uctions in salary and some savings from grants are the only operating resources available to support these expenses. We are currently using department reserves to support these operational costs, but expect those reserves to be depleted this year i f we con tinue with this model. This has resulted in the need to cut back staffing, rely heavily on student staff and volunteer peer educators, and to cut back on some programs. WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION While we recognize that space is at a premium on campus, the CSWHP Wellness Room was r eallocated to another un it to convert it to an office. With students reporting stress being the #1 barrier to academic success, this is a critical n eed and resource for students. ASUC I asked CSWHP to create a wellness room space at their annual Reclaiming Mental Health conference this year and last year and it was heavily utilized and appreciated by students at the conference. We even collected data that supports this as a resource that students definitel y want back and would utilize. We hope that we are eventually given that space back for students to again utilize and build upon to support their mental and emotional well being. Having sufficient space for peers and stude nt interns can be a challenge. The cluster is discussing how the 520 sq . ft. space that it shares with CARE peers can be better divided. The combined budget and space challenges severely impact our ability to offer the programs and services th e students both want and need. We could do much more programming if we had the appropriate spaces (pr ogramming and training) to do so. Couple that with the fact that we don't have the budget to \"rent\" space as a department in the Student Center, Aldrich Park or other spaces on campus, we are incredibly limited on what we can offer as a department and have been relying on just meeting requests of student organizations, housing communities, campus departments and others than can provide/reserve the space we need to meet their program/service request. While we finally have a Registered Dietician/Nutritionist on staff now, it is a part -time position shared with Student Health (25% time in each department). This is still inadeq uate for a campus of our size and a major gap concern considering all of the food allergies, food insecurity concerns and fad diets that remain a major issue for UCI students , along with the disordered eating and more serious clinical concerns that students can face. XI. MISCELLANEOUS Not available XII. 2017-18 ACCOMPLISHMENTS Last year the CSWHP established a strong and unique partnership with the Program in Public Health to conduct focus groups on the mental health and wellness needs of the UCI students and to develop a Certificate Program in C ollegiate Health and Wellness. The Mental Health Research Team, which c o n s i s t e d o f t h e C S W H P A s s i s t a n t D i r ector Beth England- Mackie, Professor Dr. Zuzana Bic, 12 undergraduate students and 3 MPH students, collected both in -person and online responses from almost 500 students. This data will be used to enhance and expand programming and services to better meet the needs of UCI students. In addition, a proposal was submitted to the Curriculum Committee for the Program in Public Health for a Certificate of Completion in College Population Health Promotion and Wellness which was approved during Spring 2018. Student s will be able to begin the certificate program beginning Summer 2018. Upon completion, students will receive their certificate at the Undergraduate Honors Program . Emotional Well -Being Programs Manager Jasmine Blackburn, developed and taught a new 1.3 uni t class , Anteater Tough: Building Habits for Resilience, in collaboration with staff from the Counseling Center and Student Life & Leadership. Our Registered Dietician collaborated with the F RESH Basic Needs H ub to answer student nutrition questions on sit e, as well as providing nutrition workshops as pa rt of the Smart Eaters Series. Food insecurity is a huge problem across the UC system and helping empower students with nutrition knowledge that promotes healthy eating on a budget is vital to a student 's we ll being physically, mentally and academically. The Wellness & Peer Education Programs Manager Natalie D'Azzo taught several health and wellness 1.3 unit classes throughout the year - Adulting: Nutrition, Cooking and Self -Care Basics; Introduction WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION to Health and Wellness; and Introduction to Mindfulness and Meditation. These courses were designed to help students build positive coping skills, reduce stress levels and develop a self -care plan. Staff members continued to be actively involved in leadership roles in the Healthy Campus Network Initiative, which was launched in 2016 -17 and funded by the UC Pre sident Janet Napolitano. Director Doug Everhart serves on the overall Advisory Group for the initiative; Assistant Director Beth England - Mackie serves as one of the leads on the Sexual Health Workgroup; and Wellness and Peer Education Programs Manager Natalie D'Azzo and Registered Dietician Jody Margolis serve on the Nutrition Workgroup. The CSWHP Peer Health Educator program continues to be an attra ctive oppor tunity for students. We had over 120 students apply this year, but were only able to select 28, with space and budget limitations. XIII. 2018-19 GOALS Address the budget/funding concerns and identify sustainable solutions Continue to seek and build partnerships with academic departments Seek to regain and make functional our Wellness Room space Continue to increase awareness and visibility of our center as a valuable student resource Continue to grow our outreach numbers by working smarter, not harder (i.e. same number of programs, services with larger and more intentional reach strategies). XIV. AWARDS Wellness & Peer Education Programs Manager Natalie D'Azzo received an Outstanding Supporters of Prevention Award from the Irvine Prevention Coalition. Beth England- Mack ie received a Student Affairs \"SPIRIT\" Award for her leadership in creating the Collegiate Health & Wellness Certificate Program in partnership with the Program in Public Health . XV. LEARNING OUTCOMES 2017-18 Updates Peer Health Education Program LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT By participating in our yearlong Peer Health Education Program and presenting health education workshops to peers, Peer Health Educators will increase their knowledge in the following areas: self - care, active listening, campus resources, the b ystander concept and program planning . Measured By: Pre and post surveys of student opinions, beliefs; interviews: one -on-one Results: The Peer Health Educators (PHEs) were given a pre -test in April of 2017 and post- test in June of 2018 in which the y rated their level of knowledge in the following topic areas: personal self -care techniques, techniques for active listening, campus resources, the bystander concept, planning a successful program and high performing characteristics. The pre -test was give n prior to the start of training and the post -test was administered at the end of the PHEs' one year of volunteer service. The results show tremendous growth from 2.30 to 3.0 at pre -test to 3.5 to 3.77 at post -test, on a scale of 1 (low) to 4 (high). The students increased their knowledge and skill set by participating in the 1.3 unit Peer Health Educator course in the 2017 spring quarter (facilitated by Wellness & Peer Education Programs Manager Natalie D'Azzo) where students are trained in the Bacchus Initiatives of NASPA Certified Peer Educator program. They all passed the exam to become Bacchus Certified Peer Educators. The course covers the topics that were assessed and much more, including the roles of a WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES CENTER FOR STUDENT WELLNESS & HEALTH PROMOTION PHE, intersectionality, inclusive communication , referral skills, being a role model and public speaking. During the course, students also had the opportunity to practice creating and presenting their own group presentations on a wellness topic. Once the course is completed, students put their skills i nto practice for the next academic year. They represent our office and spread wellness education through presentations and large and small events. Their personal and professional growth continues throughout the year at biweekly training meetings. We are ve ry pleased with the growth of our students and moreover with their satisfaction in what this program provides them Use: Providing feedback to student/participant; reporting results Peer Health Educators LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT Sexual Health Peer Edu cators will improve presentation and communication skills as measured through direct assessment by the Sexual & Relationship Health Programs Manager . Measured By: Student performance (e.g., student oral presentation) rated without rubric. Results: Sexual Health (SH) Peer Educators are part of a larger group of Peer Health Educators but are trained on s exual and relationship health. During the Fall quarter they are trained by the Sexual Health Program Manager and other subject matter experts as they ty pically begin with on ly a basic level of knowledge. They also participate in a four -hour Professional Development Training by Planned Parenthood and receive a Certificate of Completion for this training. They learn about birth control, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual orientation, gender identity, consent and healthy relationships. The SH Peers observe the Program Manager presenting workshops in classrooms, housing communities and student organizations and begin to co -facil itate starting Winter quarter . Evaluations are given at each workshop and reviewed together in weekly meetings with a discussion of what went well, what could be modified and what they learned. In addition, the peers are given helpful feedback on ways to improve their communic ation a nd presentation skills. As we move into the Spring quarter, the SH Peers begin to facilitate the workshops on their own with some supervision by the Program Manager. In the beginning, the peers are not as confident (e.g. hesitate on explanations, speak t oo softly, defer questions to the Program Manager) as they are still learning the content area and working on their public speaking skills. By the end of the year, the SH Peers were able to facilitate the workshops on their own and answer approximately 90% of the students' questions accurately. Their knowledge of sexual health and relationships increased substantially as well as their confidence in delivering the workshops. Several of the SH Peers developed their own workshops and presented them several t imes during spring quarter. From Fall 2017 through Spring 2018, 36 workshops were conducted reaching a total of 2,180 undergraduate students.

IX. ADVISORY COMMITTEE UCI Counseling Center Governance X. MAJOR ISSUES Demand vs. Resources: Unlike the previous 3 years, in 2017 -18, the increased rate of student presentation for services surpassed our ability to provide initial appointments within our wait time goal of 10 business days for 9 weeks (7 of w hich were during fall quarter). We changed our clinical service offerings to emphasize access even further by increasing initial assessment appointments start ing in mid -fall, and we were able to average 4.7 business day wait time for initial assessment when looking across the complete year. Unfortunately, the shift of our clinical services capacity to WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES COUNSELING CENTER focus on initial appointments c reated a decrease in our follow -up service capacity, which was already challenged to serve all UCI students whose issues were appropriate for our scope of follow - up services . Staffing: Rapid center expansion and limited management and administrative resources has impeded ability to ke ep pace with the needed recruitment efforts Retention of Staff: High demand and acuity of services has contributed to retention challenges. Salaries: The Counseling Psychologists positions began the Union accretion process in 2017 (UPTE). To date, negotiations remain at an impasse system wide, which has negatively impacted staff salaries and prevented the Counseling Center fro m addressing salary inequities. Furthermore, UCI is losing staff to other UC and local university campuses that can offer more compe titive salaries. General Funding Allocations: Almost all increased funding over the past five years has been specificall y earmarked for salaries only. The UCI Counseling Center staff has rapidly grown, while the funding for supplies and expe nses remains al most unchanged. Efforts to increase this area of permanent funding have been unsuccessful causing us to rely heavily on carry forward money. Eventually, the need to keep up with general expenses (computers, EMR licensing fees, accommodation software, etc.) will far outpace the funding available even in carry forward money. Space: The UCI Counseling Center is currently divided into two locations: Main Building and Annex. The Annex location remains a \"rental\" agr eement with the Student Center. Initial agreeme nt indicated that Counseling Center could rent the space for 2- 3 years. We are now entering into the third year. Obtaining permanent space is critical to service the demands. UCOP Risk Initiatives and System wide Mandates: Continued rise in risk managemen t activities and expectations has dictated a need for counseling center management team to redirect attention to generating system wide reports, responding to calls for data, record standardization, case management, chart review processes, internal/externa l peer reviews and addressing privacy practices . XI. MISCELLANEOUS Rapid e xpansion of student population overall and self -supporting degree programs for students has created increased demands and complexities in determining student eligibility for services. Current national leadership has initiated executive orders and legislation that has negatively impacted marginalized student groups prevalent on our campus. Complexity of national and statewide privacy laws has highlighted the longstanding need for a system - wide attorney specializing in mental health law . Need and demand for increased services for high -risk populations has resulted in exploration of possible satellite locations and funding support. XII. 2017-18 ACCOMPLISHMENTS 16% increase in number of students served through clinical services in 2017 -18 when compar ed to 2016- 17 Established liaison relationship with Esports Partnering with Athletic Department to meet NCAA standards for mental health Purchased Therapist -assisted Online (TAO) to augment services an d help with demand Implemented Beyond Ring Road, a two -part panel and guest speakers program for graduating students Grant -funded electronic GIA was completed , 20 students participated in the pilot Implemented drop -in hours with one of our psychologists at the Cross -Cultural Center WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES COUNSELING CENTER Implemented drop -in hours with one of our psychologists at the Center for Black Cultures, Resources & Research UCI Student Staff were integrated into Counseling Center's staff recruiting process Introduced one -session counseling appointments to help manage demand during peak times XIII. 2018-19 GOALS Increase 1) clinical mental health services, and 2) outreach programs provided to the UCI campus community through added technology (i.e., TAO) Outreach efforts will include a focus on coll aboration with other campus units i.e. Law School, LGBT Resource Center, Esports Team, School of Social Ecology and CARE Office Implement varsity screener through Center for Collegiate Mental Health (CCMH) for student athletes UC Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) has reached a consensus to seek and maintain IACS accreditation.

Part of STUDENT EMPLOYEE/PEER EDUCATOR Collaborative Assessment Measured By: Student product (e.g., portfolio, journal) rated using rubric; student performance (e.g., student oral presentation) rate d using rubric; Student product (e.g., portfolio, journal) rated without rubric Results: The rubrics were used on four occasions over the course of the Fall 2017 training of all peer coaches, where each peer coach rotated through each of the roles outli ned above. Rubrics assessed peer coaches' development of attentive listening skills and readiness to be assigned clients (students seeking coaching services) upon the start of Winter 2018 quarter. Peer coaches needed scores of 2 or better (on a 3-point rat ing scale) to be considered ready to see clients. 100% of peer coaches earned mean scores of 2.7 or better in four different role -plays.

XV. LEARNING OUTCOMES 2017-18 Updates: UC mandated TB Screening and Immunization Compliance Program for all ne w incoming students PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY In an effort to i ncrease understanding among new incoming students of the public health importance of compliance with UC 's TB screening and immunization policy and to maximize overall compliance rates, SHC will : 1) continue to improve/simplify/enhance instructions and information provided to new students including production of instructional videos; revisions to the WH&CS student health portal and updates to the SHC website; 2) enhance collaboration with campus partners regarding communications regarding these admission health requirements; and 3) organize and plan seven \"Health Clearance & Immunization Fairs \" in an effort to accommodate students and increase compliance. To measure the success of this immunizatio n awareness initiative, the SHC will generate ongoing compliance reports through PnC to show compliance rates. These PnC reports will also allow SHC staff to see what areas of the compliance process students are failing to complete before the compliance de adlines. The goal for 2018 -19 is to have 90% of incoming students compliant by the deadline date of October 26, 2018 and 100% compliance by the start of the winter quarter . WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES STUDENT HEALTH CENTER Measured By: Other Results: (Learning outcomes were assessed by reviewing and calculating compliance data in the immunization compliance module of SHC 's electronic health record system Point and Click. The percentage of Fall 2017 incoming students who complied with UC 's mandated TB screening requirement increased from 31% in mid -August 2017 to 80% at the start of Winter recess in December 2017. This is an indication that increased messaging and communications to students and parents directly as well as to campus partners was, by and large, effective. However, the number of non -compl iant students was still excessive particularly in consideration of the fact that, starting in Fall of 2018, academic holds will be placed on non -compliant students preventing their enrollment in Winter quarter classes. With regard to immunization complianc e, the percentage of compliance increased from 18% in mid-August 2017 to 70% at the start of Winter recess. Although a significant increase was realized, the number of non -compliant students is still quite excessive. For Fall 2018, SHC has introduced sever al measures in an attempt to dramatically increase knowledge of and compliance with the requirements including, but not limited to, SIR attestations, Health Clearance Fairs and enhanced communications with all academic units . Use: Refining assessment to ols/LOs; refining program/program change; unit planning and/or budgeting; reporting results EAP Students will complete the clearance requirements before the 60 day deadline PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY In an effort to increase the number of EAP students th at are cleared before the academic year begins, the SHC will implement a multi -departmental approach that will hopefully streamline the EAP clearance process. With limited Mental Health (MH) appointment availability at the SHC, it would be beneficial to ex plore the option of possibly referring EAP students to an external Psychiatrist for clearance. Additionally, using the Counseling department as a resource to assist with evaluations will give students more options to obtain their clearance(s). Furthermore, SHC plans to pilot an online EAP clearance portal similar to what UCLA is currently using. This portal will allow students to self -disclose information, which will then be reviewed by RNs/NPs/MH providers, thus eliminating the need for all clearances to b e conducted on -site and in person. Student learning success will be quantified by measuring the number of EAPs completed before the deadline vs the number of EAPs completed after the deadline. The results will then be analyzed against the number of EAP stu dents requesting clearance vs the actual number of EAP who were granted clearance by SHC . Measured By: Interviews: one -on-one; other Results: Learning outcomes were assessed by reviewing and calculating clinical data from SHC's electronic health reco rd system, Point and Click, as well as from reviewing forms presented and/or completed by students during health clearance examinations. During FY 2017 -18 and following enhanced communications efforts with the EAP program, nursing staff at SHC reviewed and tracked the amount of time between the dates on which EAP students made an appointment to obtain travel health clearances and the ac tual completion of clearances. The goal was to increase the percentage of EAP students who made appointments for and comple ted their travel health clearance requirements from within sixty days of travel to prior to sixty days before their travel. Three hundred eighteen EAP students were tracked. Nurses reported that the demand for appointments and the associated deadlines to c omplete WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES STUDENT HEALTH CENTER clearances varied significantly as they were destination specific. This made it very difficult to effectively manage scheduling of clinic visits for EAP clearances without the benefit of a more formal process to alert SHC staff well in advance of t he deadline associated with any particular destination. The review of data between July and October 2017 revealed that between the months of July to October 2017, EAP students, on average, obtained their travel health clearances in July 2.8 months prior t o date of departure. In October, this number had increased to 3.35 months prior to date of departure. This reflects an increase of 19.6% in terms of the number of days prior to date of departure that clearances were obtained. Although EAP students are gene rally very timely in obtaining their travel health clearances and within the guidelines of at least sixty days prior to date of departure, challenges remain particularly for those students who receive mental health services. In FY 2018 -19, SHC intends to focus on additional measures to streamline the clearance process including online screening in order to reduce the number of onsite visits necessary for students to obtain health clearances . Use: Refining assessment tools/LOs; providing feedback to stude nt/participant; refining program/program changes; unit planning and/or budgeting ; reporting results Diabetes education program for students who are identified as at risk of developing diabetes PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY Students identified at risk for de veloping diabetes by providers will be referred to a 1:1 diabetes education program where they will learn about diabetes, what puts them at risk for developing the disease and strategies for prevention and management. During the course of this educational program, students can develop their own individualized diabetes management plans to include fitness programs, nutritional seminars, lifestyle changes, etc. Providers will be directly involved in the planning process to ensure that the student has as much support as possible in order for their diabetes management plan(s) to be successful . Measured By: Interviews: one -on-one, Other Results: The learning outcome was assessed by a retrospective study. Medical records of 104 patients, referred to nutriti onal counseling because they had a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 30 or greater, were randomly selected and reviewed to ascertain clinical results following nutritional counseling . Obesity is defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or greater. Complications of obesity include hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, osteoarthritis, fatty liver, sleep apnea, acid reflux, reduced physical mobility, chronic back pain and cancers of breast, endometrium, pancreas, kidney, gallbladder, thyroid and colon. As a nation, ne arly 38% of US adults are obese (NHANES 2013 -14). In California, the rate of adult obesity is 25%. Among the Californians, obesity rates for age 18 -25 is 14.5%, age 26 -44 is 25.4%, and age 46 -64 is 29.6% ( stateofobesity.org/adult -obesity/). The increasing trend of obesity rates among the age groups is alarming. This indicates intervention at a younger age is warranted to combat this epidemic. Common obesity interventions include physical activity, medical treatment and nutritional counseling. Of these inter ventions, the knowledge of healthy eating and proper food choices is the cornerstone of obesity intervention and prevention strategy. WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES STUDENT HEALTH CENTER In 2017 -18 providers at the Student Health Center made a conscious effort to refer students with a BMI of 30 or greater to nutritional counseling. By learning and acquiring the knowledge of healthy eating with nutritional counseling, the students should be better equipped to manage their food choices and weights to achieve the desirable effect of weight loss. This retrospec tive chart review examined the learning outcome of nutritional counseling on weight changes among the studen ts with a BMI of 30 and above. The control group included students who have a BMI of 30 or greater but never had nutritional counseling. The experim ental group included students who had a BMI of 30 or greater and had at least one visit with our nutritionist for a comprehensive nutritional counseling. Both groups must had subsequent visits between the ranges of 2\u00bd to 7 months, with weights documented a t the Student Health Center. Results Control Group (no nutritional counseling; 47 charts randomly selected): Gained Weight: 36/46=76.6% No Lost Weight: 6/47=12.8% Experimental Group nutritional counseling; charts reviewed Gained Weight: 19/57=33.3% No Change: 5/57=5.3% Lost Weight: 35/57=61.4% This retrospective chart review of the learning outcome has shown that with nutritional counseling, students with obesity were much more likely to have success with weight loss (6 1.4% vs. 12.8%). This study demonstrated the value of nutritional counseling to combat obesity in a college health setting. Student Health Center providers will continue to refer students with obesity for nutritional counseling. College is where students c an acquire lifelong knowledge that can impact thei r future lives. For the students who have struggled with obesity, nutritional counseling can be life changing. The availability of quality nutritional counseling and continuous funding for such is definitel y warranted in a college setting based on this study . Use: Providing feedback to student/participant; refining program/program changes; reporting results 2018-19 Health clearances for Education Abroad Program (EAP) student s PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY Student Health Center (SHC) will assess the learning of students who are registered in the EAP study abroad program and who require health clearances from SHC by published deadline dates in order for the student to travel abroad. Specifically, EAP students will learn, be aware of and become knowledgeable regarding the following: 1. The specific health clearance requirements pertaining to the country to which the student is traveling. 2. The current public health issues/alerts that pertain to the country and/or re gion to which student will be traveling. 3. The deadline dates for compliance to ensure that the student's EAP program is not adversely impacted (e.g., cancelled or delayed). WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES STUDENT HEALTH CENTER 4. The importance of effective planning for travel abroad related to health care includ ing timely submission of health -related information to SHC; scheduling of appointments well in advance; and awareness of available health care resources in the country/region to which the student is traveling. Program SHC will implement a modified EAP heal th clearance program in conjunction with the EAP, its students and other affected departments. The revised program is intended to: 1. Increase student access by streamlining the health clearance process, including online clearances, so that more students can obtain clearances without the necessity of an onsite clinic visit. 2. Increase communications with students, EAP department staff and other affected campus departmental staff regarding the modified process to ensure that all parties are fully aware of the hea lth clearance requirements, deadlines, process, etc... 3. Ensure that a minimum of 95% of EAP students complete the requirements and obtain clearances by the published deadline date. Assessment Student learning will be shown by: 1. Successful completion of the task of obtaining health clearances by published deadline dates by at least 95% of EAP students. 2. EAP students will be receive pre - and post -program tests in order to demonstrate their knowledge regarding country -specific travel, public health and health cle arance requirements. 3. 3. Students who have scheduled in -person appointments and/or requested online clearances with nurses and/or providers will demonstrate awareness and knowledge regarding country -specific travel, public health and health clearance requir ements following their consultations .

Incoming students will learn: 1. The public health importance of compliance with these requirements as well as t he potential impact of non -compliance upon the entire campus community. 2. How to comply with these requirements. 3. The importance of being aware of all non -academic conditions of admission to the university. 4. The repercussions for non -compliance. WELLNESS, HEALTH & COUNSELING SERVICES STUDENT HEALTH CENTER Program UCI's Student Health Center administers a structured TB Screening/Immunizations Compliance Program that requires actions to be taken by all incoming students by published deadline dates in order to be in compliance and to avoid the application of academic holds that prevent class enrollment. Assessment Student learning will be shown by: 1. Compliance rate for incoming students will be at least 90% by the deadline date (i.e., 4th Friday of October). 2. 100% of non -compliant students will have met the requirements by the start of the Winter Recess. 3. Students must complete the task of completing an online TB screening questionnaire; self - enter immunization dates online; and upload copies of immunization records online in order to be deemed \"compliant.\" 4. A random, represent ative sample of incoming students will receive tests following the submission of their Statement of Intent to Register (SIR) and prior to the start of the Fall quarter demonstrating awareness and knowledge of these requirements and to help SHC assess the e ffectiveness of the messaging and communications efforts during the pre - orientation and post -orientation periods. 5. 5. Point and Click (PnC), the secure electronic health record utilized by SHC, is the repository for students' health information including TB screening and Immunization records. PnC also serves as the tool for determining student compliance with these requirements .
