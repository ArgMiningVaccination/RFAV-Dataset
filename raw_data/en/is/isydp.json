The result has shown that the proportion of BASRD and the appropriate time of taking them should be carefully grasped in treating cancer with Chinese and Western drugs. Different dosage and potency of BASRD should be used for different syndromes and stages. At the early stage of interventional treatment, the use of drugs for replenishing qi and activating blood can not only enhance immunity and reduce metastatic rate of cancer but also increase long-term survival rate. After the focus has been stabilized, the combined use of strengthening the body resistance and eliminating pathogenic factors and the a dditional use of drugs for resolving masses and removing stasis can enhance the effective rate of treating non-small cell lung cancer of late stage. Judging from research into molecular biology, most scholars hold that at the early stage of cancerous change, a series of genetic alterations damage the balance of cell growth, making it out of control. Most of protooncogenes are growth factor and its receptor necessary for the growth of normal cells. 1 Their mutation, proliferation and rearrangement can lead to excessive growth of cells. Lack, loss, deactivation or variation of other genes can cause generation or development of tumor. Immun- odeficiency is also a prerequisite for generation and development of tumor. Oncogene, antioncogene and associated genes of apoptosis are often related to tumor. Tumor metastasis resulting from invasion by tumor cells and from effect of metastasis-related genes is a multi-step process of development. Firstly, the metastatic feature of tumor cells, decrease in adhesive force and increase in superficial charges make tumor cells separate from mother cells. Secondly, the motion of tumor cells, release of protein-solving enzyme and other factors strengthen their activity to penetrate basement membrane and destroy cellular matrix, making tumor cells infiltrate into peripheral tissue. Thirdly, potential invasion by tumor cells, adhesion to vascular and lymphangial basement membrane and the ability to evade being recognized by immune system make tumor cells invade vascular and lymphatic vessels and survive in circulatory system. Tumor cells adhere to the inner wall of new vascular and lymphatic vessels because of their adhesive factors, angiogenic factors and formation of micro-tumor. Due to changes in ingredients of the basement membrane of vascular and lymphangial endotheliocytes, tumor cells pierce Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine, December 2 009, V ol. 29, No. 4 302 through the wall of vessels to form micro-metastatic focus. Angiogenic factors promote the growth of blood vessels and the expansion of metastatic focus. It is uneasy for tumor to go through a process from generation to metastasis. An article shows that for a 1-1.8 g tumor, 1 g tumor can release (3.2\u00b11.4) \u00d7 10 5 tumor cells into blood in 24 hours, but less than 1/1000 of tumor cells can eventually survive and form metastatic tumor.2 Blood-stasis Syndrome is Main Pathological Change in Generation and Metastasis of Malignant Tumor 1. Malignant tumorigenesis resulting from blood-stasis syndrome TCM holds that malignant tumor is directly related to blood stasis. Its main pathological change is the concentrated reflection of blood stasis, toxin and deficiency in internal organs, channels and skin. Cancerous toxin, an endopathic cause, can induce blood stasis and deficiency. Blood stasis is caused by poor blood circulation. In observation of nail fold microcirculation in tumor patients, it is found that microcirculatory disturbance makes blood flow slow down. 3 The obvious erythrocyte aggregation, exudation and hemorrhage are advantageous to the generation, development and metastasis of tumor. The stimulation by toxic substances of tumor cells can aggravate microcirculatory disturbance. In probing the relations of microcirculation disturbance to tumor formation and metastasis, 4 white micro-thrombus was found in blood circulation of 88% of patients and its quantity was correlated positively with the progress of the illness. Blood stasis is the main pathologi cal cause of cancer such as gastric cancer. Researches by ZHOU A-gao ( ) and others have shown that 4 hypercoagulative indexes of patients with malignant tumor in stomach were significantly different from normal values. 5 Antithrombin , plasma fibronectin and fibrinolysis activity were significantly lower than normal values, indicating reduced anticoagulative and fibrinolytic functions of tumor patients. Factor relative antigen was significantly higher than normal value. Regressive analysis of relationship between clinical pathology and hypercoagulative indexes shows that the severer the illness is and the later the stage of disease is, the severer the hypercoagulative state in the patient of gastric cancer is. Most patients with liver cancer are clinically manifested as blood-stasis syndrome. 82.7% of 440 cancer patients under hemorheologic observation were in different state of blood hyperviscosity with the order of cardiac cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, oral cancer and gastric carcinoma. 6 Plasma fibrinogen of liver cancer patients is also higher than that of patients with other hepatic diseases. In his research, WANG Yu-tang confirmed that 32.6% of 136 lung cancer patients presented thrombocytosis, and that the incidence was 39.3% in patients at stage and 32% at stage. 7 Having detected 11 clotting indexes of 41 lung cancer patients, LI Guo-xian and othersindicated that 61% of the 41 lung cancer patients were in hypercoagulative state. 8 The more malignant the cancer was and the later stage the patient was at, the more obvious the hypercoagulative state was. 2. Development and metastasis of malignant tumor is continuation of blood-stasis syndrome Clinical research has conf irmed that the development and metastasis of tumor accompanied by blood stasis syndrome were manifested as blood hyperviscosity and swelling of internal organs to press their peripheral tissues. Blood hyperviscosity can promote cancer metastasis, during which the hypercoagulant Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine, December 2 009, V ol. 29, No. 4 303 state exists in microthrombosis in oncocytes, its adhesion to capillary endothelium and other metastatic links. As discovered in research into the hemorheology of 77 lung cancer patients, plasma viscosity and fibrinogen of patients with lung cancer transfer were much higher than those of patients without lung cancer transfer, indicating that hypercoagulant state of lung cancer patients was a main internal factor for lung cancer transfer, which was very closely related to blood-stasis syndrome in microcosmic. 9 Hemorheological index of gastric cancer patients at various stage shows that the specific viscosity of whole blood and plasma in lymph node metastasis group, far-end metastasis group and no metastasis group were remarkably higher than those in healthy group. Having summarized a great number of articles, MA Wen-jian and others held that hypercoagulation might directly promote tumor metastasis and was closely related to blood-stasis syndrome in TCM. 10 It can thus be believed that blood-stasis is an important factor for relapse and metastasis of cancer. BASRD can Relieve Hypercoagulation and Improve Inner Environment in Which Malignant Tumor Exists 1. BASRD is main medicine for treating relapse and metastasis of cancer BASRD are main medicine for eliminating cancer. Clinical pharmacology has confirmed that BASRD, such as E Curcumae), Hua ( Flos Campsis), hypercoagulation by means of inhibiting agg- regation of blood platelet, improving micro- circulation and lowering blood viscosity to make new capillaries in tumor metastatic focus degenerate and to enhance immunity recognition ability. Extract from Chi Shao ( Radix Paeoniae Rubra) could prolong prothrombin time and obviously inhibit spontaneous metastasis in the mice with Lewis lung cancer and melanoma. Dan Shen Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae), Pi ( Cortex Moutan) can lower TXB 2 level in plasma and inhibit generation of TXA 2 in tumor-bearing mice. They could exert an adverse effect on cancer metastasis by inhibiting adhesion of tumor cells to blood platelet and vascular wall. Ligustrazine injection can enhance activation of NK cells in animals and inhibit melanoma metastasis to lung. BASRD can inhibit tumor generation and metastasis through inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. Tanshinone prevents cells from entering S stage and inhibits DNA synthesis to induce apoptosis. Achyranthes bidentata poly- saccharides can induce generation of tumor necrosis factor in mice. Total glucosides of paeony have dual regulative effect on tumor necrosis factor produced by macrophage in abdominal cavity of rats. To sum up, blood-activating drugs can alter whole blood viscosity and ability of platelet aggregation to prevent cancer cells from penetrating vascular wall. 11 BASRD are main medicine for preventing and treating cancer relapse and metastasis. 39 patients with tumor of digestive tract were treated by chemotherapy combined with blood-activating and stasis-resolving therapy with a recipe consisting of Dan Shen ( Salviae Miltiorrhizae) 20g, Tao Ren ( Semen Vaccariae) 15g, Shan Dou Gen ( Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine, December 2 009, V ol. 29, No. 4 304 Radix Sophorae Zha ( charred Crataegi) 15g with a modification according to the patient's condition, and among them 30 cases (76.4%) survived for over 3 years, 21 cases for over 5 years and 5 cases for over 7 years, indicating that the combined use of Chinese drugs and chemotherapy could obviously increase survival rate and noticeably decrease relapse and metastasis. The patients of nasopharyngeal carcinoma were treated with blood-activating and stasis- resolving formula consisting of Huang Radix Salviae with a modification according to syndrome differentiation and radio- therapy, and the results showed that the treatment group treated with blood-activating and stasis- resolving formula and radiotherapy was significantly superior in rate of tumor subsiding and long-term survival rate to the control group treated with radiotherapy alone ( P<0.05). 13 This shows that combined use of BASRD and radiotherapy can strengthen therapeutic effect and inhibit relapse and metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In a clinical trail on 20 cases of liver cancer treated with Hua Ji Dan ( mass-resolving pill) consisting of Nao Sha ( Sal Purpureum), Ma Qian Zi ( Semen Strychni) and Gan Qi Resina Toxicodendri) and Kang Liu Jian ( tumor-resisting decoction) ( Eupolyphaga seu Steleophaga) for activating blood and resolving mass with a modification according to the patient's condition, 2 cases survived for less than 6 months, 5 cases for 6-12 months, 6 cases for 12-18 months, 3 cases for 18-24 months, 2 cases for more than 5 years and 2 cases for over 10 years, with an average survival rate of 19 months, and 1 case was cured, 6 cases were clinically cured, 5 cases relieved, 7 cases improved, 1 case failed. 14 22 cases of primary carcinoma of liver were treated by the method of soothing the liver and regulating qi, and activating blood and eliminating stasis with a formula consisting of Chai Hu 5g with a modification according to the patient's condition for 4 therapeutic courses (20 days as a course), and the results showed that 3 cases were relieved, 10 improved, and 9 failed with an improved rate of 45.45%. 15 This indicates that the method can alleviate symptoms of primary liver cancer, reduce the sufferings and enhance living quality of patients. Chinese drugs for strengthening the body resistance and activating blood and resolving stasis can also be used to treat and prevent relapse and metastasis of cancer. 69 patients with gastric cancer at intermediate Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine, December 2 009, V ol. 29, No. 4 305 or late stage were treated with a basic recipe for expelling cold with drugs of warm nature and resolving stasis, strengthening the spleen and stomach, eliminating toxin and resisting cancer, 16 consisting of Huang Yao Zi ( Rhizoma Dioscoreae ( Fructus Jujubae), and other 33 cases were treated with Chinese drugs and chemotherapy as the controls. 85.4%, 84%, 56.4% and 45.4% of the patients in the treatment group survived for more than 0.5, over 1, over 3 and 5 years respectively with the average survival time at 2.45 years, whereas 83.3%, 76.7%, 53.3%, 43.3% and 1.73 years in the control group respectively, indicating that the therapeutic effect in the treatment group was better than that in the control group. It follows that as compared to the chemo- therapy, Chinese medicine can particularly work on long-term survival time and living quality of patients with gastric cancer at intermediate or late stage. Jiawei Yiguan Jian ( \u0874 Supplemented Ever-Effective Decoction) with the effects of nourishing yin and clearing away heat, and activating blood-and resolving stasis, consisting of Sha Shen ( Radix ( Zaocys) and Wu Gong ( Scolopendra), was used to treat 106 patients with lung cancer, of whom 50 cases of primary lung cancer missed operational opportunity or could not accept radiochemical therapy. 7 The results of the treatment for 3-4 courses (4 weeks as a course) showed that 3 cases were completely alleviated, 21 cases partially alleviated, 36 cases were controlled and 46 cases were failed with a total effective rate of 56.6%. It was found in follow-up that 10 cases survived for 5-12 months, 18 for 1-2 years, 19 for 2-3 years, 20 for 3-4 years, 13 for 4-5 years, 6 for 6 years, 7 for 7 years, 4 for 8 years, 1 for 9 years and 2 for 11 years, showing good effect on interior-heat due to yin deficiency, and deficiency of both qi and yin . It is reported that Qingyu Fuzheng Tang ( decoction for removing blood stasis and strengthening body resistance) made of Huang Qi ( Astragali) 40g, Bai be taken after being infused in the hot decoction) and Xi Yang Shen ( Radix Panacis Quinquefolium) 10g was used to treat 60 patients of gastric cancer with syndrome of qi stagnation, blood stasis as well as deficiency of both qi and blood at intermediate or late stage. 18 The patients were randomly divided into a treatment group treated with Chinese medicine for 3 months and a control group treated with chemotherapy for 3 cycles. The results showed that 2 cases were completely alleviated and 12 cases partially alleviated with a total effective rate of 47.8% in the treatment group as compared to Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine, December 2 009, V ol. 29, No. 4 306 43.3% in the control group, showing no significant difference. There were si gnificant differences in living quality (P <0.01) and in body weight ( P<0.05). It can be seen that in the treatment of gastric cancer at intermediate or late stage, Chinese medicine for activating blood and resolving stasis, nourishing qi and blood, and softening and resolving hard mass can obviously enhance living quality of patients with remarkably better effect than that in chemotherapy.Jiawei Zhi Po Liu Jun Tang (\u0874 Supplemented Cao ( Radix strengthening the spleen, removing blood stasis, dredging collaterals and resolving mass and Ping Xiao Pian ( \u0003Canelim Tablets) \u0003were used to treat 40 cases of gastric cancer with effective rate of 82.5%. 19 Their living quality was enhanced in 13 cases, stabilized in 23 cases and lowered in 4 cases, and their body weight was increased in 12 cases, stabilized in 24 cases and lowered in 4 cases, indicating the treatment can relieve clinical sym- ptoms and enhance living quality. Pain due to advanced esophagus cancer was treated with Yiqi Sanjie Tang ( Decoction for nourishing qi and resolving mass) made of Huang Qi ( Radix Astragali) 30g, plus Xiao Jie San ( Powder for resolving mass) consisting of Shui Zhi ( Hirudo) 300g, Calculus Bovis) 15g. 20 32 patients (40%) suffered from pain of grade and 48 patients (60%) from pain of grade before treatment. 0 grade pain took place in 68 patients (85%), grade pain in 8 patients (10%) and grade pain in 4 patients (5%) after treatment with pain obviously reduced ( P<0.05), indicating that the therapy has remarkable therapeutic effect on pain due to carcinoma of esophagus and can improve cytoimmunity and humoral immunity. It is reported that 52 cases of primary liver cancer were treated with Jiawei Zhi Po Liu Jun Tang ( \u0874 Yi Ren ( Semen 21 and Ai Di injection, Elemene injection, Brucea javanica fat emulsion injection and Kanglaite injection were infused respectively. 1-3 courses of treatment with one month as a course resulted in survival time less than 6 months in 8 cases (15.3%), more than 6 months in 10 cases (19.2 %), over 1 year in 25 cases (48.1%), over 2 years in 6 cases (11.5%) and over 3 years in 3 cases (5.8%) with 1 year above survival rate of 65.2%. It is reported that 36 gastric cancer patients after operation 22 were treated with chemotherapy and a method for strengthening body resistance and removing blood stasis with a recipe consisting of Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine, December 2 009, V ol. 29, No. 4 307 Huang Qi ( Radix Astragali), Bie Angelicae Sinensis), Fu She Cao ( Herba Hedyotis Diffusae). The treatment resulted in local metastasis and far-end transfer in 10 cases and no transfer or relapse in 22 cases in the treatment group as compared to 18 and 11 cases respectively in a control group of 32 cases treated with chemotherapy alone. Much less cases of metastasis in the treatment group than those in the control group confirms that the combined use of Chinese drugs for strengthening body resistance and removing blood stasis and chemotherapy can reduce far-end metastasis after operation for gastric cancer. 2. Blood-activating and stasis-resolving method has dual effects of promoting and inhibiting adherence of tumor The view on preventing tumor metastasis with drugs for promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis is challenged. In pharmacologically basic research, ZHANG Pei-tong and others 23 have observed the influences of ligustrazine, hirudin, tanshinone A and thrombase on invasion and adherence of a human highly metastatic giant lung carcinoma cell line PGCL3 and low metastasis lung cancer cell line PAa. The result has shown that ligustrazine, hirudin and thrombase can promote adherence of PGCL3 cells to different extent while tanshinone can inhibit their adherence. Ligustrazine, hirudin and tanshinone A can inhibit invasion of Boyden chamber by PGCL3 cells and inhibit the action of platelet in synergy with invasion by PGCL3 and PAa cells, while thrombase can obviously promote those processes. It can thus be seen that blood-activating drugs may have dual effects of promoting and inhibiting invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. It is reported that Dan Shen ( Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae) can promote hematogenous dissemination and metastasis of cancer cells in experimental rats. It was clinically confirmed that tissue plasminogen activator of plasma in the patients with some malignant cancers of blood stasis syndrome was over 1 time more active than that in control group, but there was no obvious difference in tissue plasminogen inhibitor. Obviously enhanced activity of tissue plasminogen activator, hyper- fibrinolysis and lowered blood viscosity can promote local infiltration of malignant tumor and its transfer to the whole body. Therefore, blood-activating and stasis-resolving method should be used with caution and the principle of simultaneously supporting the health and eliminating the evil should be adopted in treatment of malignant tumor. 3. BASRD should be reasonably used at appropriate time In treating malignant tumor by BASRD, it is important to grasp their ingredients and proportion in the prescription and select the drugs for obtaining better therapeutic effect and avoiding deterioration of patient's condition and deteriorated syndrome. Proper dosage and potency of BASRD should be used to treat cancer belonging to different syndromes and at different stages. In using a recipe for nourishing qi and generating blood to treat gastric cancer of qi and blood deficiency, analysis of relationship between the intensity of BASRD and metastatic rate of gastric cancer has shown that the metastatic rate of gastric cancer of qi and blood deficiency increases with the increase in proportion of BASRD. 24 It can thus be seen that when quantity and aggregation of blood plantlet obviously reduce, clotting time is remarkably prolonged and fibri- Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine, December 2 009, V ol. 29, No. 4 308 nolysate increases in patient s with gastric cancer of qi and blood deficiency, the proportion of BASRD in the recipe should be decreased to avoid tumor transfer. When drugs for strengthening the body resistance and BASRD are used together to treat cancer patients with deficiency of qi, blood, yin and yang, the dosage and proportion of drugs for strengthening the body resistance should be increased. Research into precancerosis of atrophic gastritis 25 has shown that gastric syndrome. Gland atypical hyperplasia extent of intestinalization in blood stasis syndrome are severer than those in other syndromes. Qi and blood should be emphatically regulated, attention should be paid to strengthening the use of blood-activating drugs, and the dosage of BASRD should be increased in order to improve local microcirculation of focus in gastric mucosa, eliminate or alleviate the infiltration of inflammatory cells, promote the recovery of atrophic gland and prevent intestinalization and abnormal hyperplasia of cells. The dose and time of administration BASRD should be grasped in treating malignant tumor with Chinese and Western medicine. In studying the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with Chinese and Western medicine, WANG Bing-sheng and others 26 put forward that BASRD have different influence before and after chemotherapy. After bronchial artery perfusion chemotherapy for 3-5 days, the drugs for nourishing qi and activating blood and drugs for nourishing qi, activating blood and resolving mass were administered respectively. In the first 6 months of chemotherapy, rate of tumor metastasis was 7.4% and 26.7% respectively. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups from 6 months to 2 years. The mean survival time was 16.1 and 13.8 months respectively. Long-term survival rate in 1, 1.5 and 2 years was 85.1%, 67.7% and 61.1% respectively in one group and 36.6%, 22.2% and 10% respectively in the other group with significant difference in 1-year survival rate between the 2 groups ( P<0.05). During short-term chemotherapy, the therapeutic effect of drugs for replenishing qi and activating blood is better than that of drugs for resolving mass and removing blood stasis, and the latter can not enhance short-term therapeutic effect. After long-term chemotherapy, no difference is found between the two groups. The reason why during short-term chemotherapy, taking drugs for resolving mass and removing blood stasis possibly promotes metastasis may be that a large amount of chemo- therapeutic drugs accumulated in the body impair vital qi, lower immunity and weaken ability of the body to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells. At that time, the additional use of drugs for resolving mass and removing blood stasis makes it easy to some extent for cancer cells to reach other sites, forming metastatic focus after a period of time. It can thus be seen that at the early st age of chemotherapy, using drugs for nourishing qi and promoting blood circulation can not only strengthen immunity and reduce the rate of cancer foci metastasis but also enhance long-term survival rate. After the focus has been stabilized, it is a good method to use drugs for strengthening the body resistance and eliminating pathogenic factors and to additionally use drugs for resolving mass and blood stasis. To sum up, in clinical treatment of tumor, BASRD should not be used alone but used in combination with deficiency-supplementing drugs for replenishing qi, assisting yang and nourishing yin to make it uneasy for tumor cells to shed off nor adhere to far end.
