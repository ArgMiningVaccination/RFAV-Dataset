[ Wisdom Story - Wealth, Success & Health ](https://myartofwellness.com/wisdom-story-wealth-success-health/) by Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. One windy Winter day, a woman looked out her window and saw three elderly men sitting by the side of the road in front of her house. A generous lady, she went out and asked them, \"Would you like to come in from the cold and have something to eat?\" The men smiled gratefully, but asked, \"Is the rest of your family at home?\" When the woman replied that they were not, but would be home a little later, the men said, \"We will wait, then.\" Later, when the woman's husband and child had returned, she went outside again and said, \"Please, come in and have some dinner with us.\" But one of the men explained, 'Only one of us can come in. This man is named \"Wealth.\" And that one is named \"Success.\" My name is \"Health.\" Go in, talk with your family, and decide which of us you would like to invite into your home. When the woman told her husband and daughter about this, her husband said, \"Let's ask Wealth to come! That way, we won't have to work anymore.\" But the woman said, \"Shouldn't we ask Success to come? Surely that would be the best choice.\" Then the couple's young daughter spoke up, \"Why don't you ask Health to come in? That way none of us will ever get sick.\" So the woman went out again and asked Health to come in. When he got up and began walking towards the house, Success and Wealth followed him. \"But-I thought-\" said the woman. Then Health explained, \"Wherever I go, Success and Wealth will follow.\" Lesson: Health is our most precious commodity. When we start making room for healthy habits, we will be able to enjoy the success and wealth that comes our way. [ TCM for Low Back Pain ](https://myartofwellness.com/tcm-low-back-pain/) by Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. The American College of Physicians has just recently issued new guidelines regarding the treatment of low back pain - specifically advocating that patients first choose natural and alternative therapies, such as acupuncture and massage, over pain medications. Acupuncture is the one modality recommended for both chronic and acute back pain. Pain in the lower back is one of the most common complaints heard by doctors. The vast majority (80%) of adults experience this pain at some point. Low back pain is the 2nd most common cause of disability among adults in the U.S. Back pain presents a challenge for physicians, because in many cases, there is no clearly discernible \"cause.\" Imaging scans may help us get a picture of structural damage to the spine, but they do not tell us the whole story. Pain is not just about structural or mechanical problems in the body. The problem may be mechanical, but it may also be chemical, emotional, behavioral, sociological, or a combination of any of these. In my 30 years of practice in treating all different types of lower back pain, I have often seen patients who had only minor structural problems but were experiencing severe pain. I have also seen many patients who have had surgery to correct a problem; their scans may show that the problem has been \"fixed\"-but they are still in a lot of pain. In other words, a person's experience of pain or loss of mobility may not correspond to what we see in an image. Common conditions leading to back pain include (but are not limited to): - Degenerated disc - Bulging or herniated disc - Spinal stenosis - Spondylolisthesis (slipped disc) - Spinal scoliosis - arthritis - Muscle strain - Muscle spasm - Pinched nerves - Nerve damage - Kidney stone or gallstones - Digestive issues (constipation) Acupuncture has traditionally been the primary treatment for back pain in China, and still is today. It is an excellent modality for treating back pain, because the TCM approach to diagnosis and treatment is to address the underlying cause of the pain. It not only reduces symptoms, but works to correct and rebalance the body's function, promote and rebuild the body's healing process and therefore, not only eliminate pain, but boost your ability to avoid lower back pain in the first place. The most common TCM differentiations of back pain include deficiency type pain - which is chronic, dull pain that feels better when you rest, Qi and Blood stagnation - a sharp, stabbing pain that is often reduced when exercising but feels worse once you slow down, and Cold/Damp - which feels stiff, sore, or tight, feels better with warmth and is worse in the morning and when the weather is cold and damp. With TCM, we aim for long-term, lasting results. At the same time, we guide the patient in vital lifestyle improvements, such as regular de-stress meditation, gentle exercise such as Tai Chi or yoga, and an anti-inflammatory diet. Here are some specific things you can do at home to help enhance the effects of acupuncture treatment: - Moderate exercise: walk, swim, Tai Chi, yoga, Pilates, and gentle stretching. - Avoid lifting anything heavy; always remember to bend from the knees and not from the back when lifting any kind of weight. - Weight control - Diet: avoid coffee, spicy foods, nightshade vegetables (tomato, potato, eggplant and bell pepper). - Change posture during your work, move around for a few minutes every hour, at least. - Cold and Heat: Use a cold compress for the first 3 days if there is acute injury or any time right after exercise. Use heat 3-5 times per day for chronic pain. - Make sure your mattress is medium firmness and comfortable. - Do stretches for the lower back Acupressure for Low Back Pain Using your opposite thumb or forefinger, locate the crevice between the bones of your 4th and 5th finger, just beneath the knuckles. Press deeply until you feel tenderness there. Hold the pressure while you gently but vigorously move and stretch your lower spine and hips. Then, drag your thumb or finger down, finding another crevice just above the base where the 4th and 5th metacarpal bones meet. Apply pressure, again, while wiggling and turning from the lower back. This will help release tension and tightness and relieve pain. [ Who Is Your Best Doctor? ](https://myartofwellness.com/who-is-your-best-doctor/) By Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. What Do Doctors Do? When you are sick or injured, you automatically think about finding a good doctor. You rush to get tests done. You are given an examination and, usually, medicine. But have you thought about who \"cures\" you when you break your arm? An orthopedic specialist provides high-level technology to examine you, and gives you a cast and some pain medication. But do they \"fix\" your arm? The Pros and Cons of Western Medicine Modern advances in Western medicine have allowed us to correct many conditions that historically have been crippling or deadly. How amazing that surgeons can re-attach digits, that EMT techs can re-start heartbeats, and that some medicines can cure or prevent life-threatening diseases! In general, people are living longer and enjoying better quality of life than ever before. But there are drawbacks, too. Western medicine tends to study the body on a microscopic, cellular level, rather than looking at the whole person. The causes of many diseases remain unknown, so treatments usually address symptoms only. Conditions may come back if you stop taking your medicine. Medicines can have serious side effects. Surgery can create other problems, such as damaged or scarred tissues. Specialists focus on one part of your body, not the whole, so that problems are not understood as being connected to one another. It can feel as if you are being treated like a machine, with separate parts, not as a real person. Sometimes a doctor might try to help you solve one problem, only to find that others then crop up or worsen. And while we talk about prevention, most doctors are not trained in nutrition, and often don't have the time or inclination to discuss their patients' lifestyle choices in any depth. What happens in our body when we are sick? The cell-the most fundamental unit of the human body- every second that we are alive, has an amazing ability to renew itself. When a pathogen enters your body, or your body is injured, it launches all necessary systems to diagnose the problem and then begins producing healing factors to work in concert. First, white blood cells go to the area to fight any infection that may have gotten in. They kill off any weak or dying cells. If cells are only slightly damaged, they can switch on special genes which start repairs. If they are too old or damaged, they will self-destruct. When there is bleeding, the platelet cells form a blood clot, so that you will not bleed to death. Once all of this is done, and the rubbish of damaged, dead cells has been cleared away, healthy cells start making copies of themselves to fill the gaps. This is a vitally important process, and the body must work and watch carefully, because if anything goes wrong-say, unhealthy cells are not cleared away, or start making copies of themselves\u2014 the result can be serious disease, such as cancer or autoimmune disease. Self-healing ability is our miracle doctor. If you have ever had a pet or the chance to observe a sick animal, you may remember what they do to recover. They usually choose to lie there, without any activity, not even eating. Their bodies just concentrate on healing, conserving all energy for self-repair. Human beings are the same. When we are sick, we need to rest, eat very lightly, and drink a lot of water, allowing our body to fix any damage and clear out any waste. We are born with this innate ability to self-heal; however, it relies on good lifestyle to encourage it. Sometimes there are impurities that block energy flow to the compromised area. If we continually feed \"junk\" food into the body, and don't allow it the rest it needs, then our ability to regenerate cells and heal our own illness and injuries is severely dampened. You are the only one who is responsible to your health! Acupuncture treatment We can understand and appreciate that our bodies can heal themselves, and at the same time, we should know that sometimes we need additional assistance. For example, if there are too many toxins in the body, a detox program can help eliminate them. If there is an imbalance that is too severe, herbs can help. When there are blockages of Qi in the body, acupuncture or electro-acupuncture can help free them up. What we offer at Art of wellness is the promotion of the body's natural healing to take place. But, who is your best doctor? YOU ARE. Recognize, respect, and take responsibility for your own healing power. When you not feeling well, find a good team to assist your body to heal itself. Remember, prevention comes before treatment. Let healthy lifestyle become a habit. Investment in your health is the best win-win decision. [ Cupping Therapy ](https://myartofwellness.com/cupping-therapy/) Cupping Q & Cai, cupping? Cupping is a healing modality that uses suction to move blood and energy (Qi) from inside the body out towards the surface. It encourages more blood flow in a particular area. It is usually used as an additional treatment in conjunction with acupuncture and/or massage. How does it work? There are a few different techniques. Most commonly heat is used: a flame is lit inside a glass or bamboo cup, which burns oxygen to create a negative pressure. Then the cups are placed against the skin in the affected area, usually along a meridian line. Another way is to use a pump to pull air out of the cup. A cup might be firmly attached to one localized area for 10-15 minutes. Another technique is \"moving\" or \"walking\" cupping, during which the cup might be moved around along both sides of the spine or in a circular motion on the back. Where does cupping come from? How long have people been doing this? Many ancient healing traditions, particularly from Asian and Eastern European cultures, have used cupping as part of their healing systems. In China, the documented use of cupping for medical purposes goes back for 3000 years. What kind of cups are used? Traditionally, cups were made of bamboo or clay. Nowadays, we most commonly use cups made of smooth, rounded glass that can be sterilized. What kind of health condition is cupping good for? - Injuries that involve blood stagnation, such as muscle strain, benefit from having excessive blood removed, reducing swelling and inflammation in the area. - Arthritic pain can be relieved by removing dampness and blood stasis to reduce inflammation. - Muscle spasm, stiffness and tightness due to tension can be released by cupping. - Cold or flu at the very beginning. Cupping can help stimulate the body's defense system to fight off viral infection. - Detoxification: cupping can help remove pathogens and is very helpful when going through a detoxification process; it helps draw toxins out from deep in the internal organs. These are just a few of the most common reasons we might use cupping, but there are many times that it can be helpful. Many conditions that involve stagnation or blockage in the body, such as chest (cold) congestion or coughs, even asthma, can be alleviated by the heat and suction that cupping on the upper back creates. What sort of condition would cupping NOT be good for? Cupping is not for every body or every condition. If you are weak, suffering from some type of physical deficiency, then cupping could draw energy out of you, weakening your body further. In that case, acupuncture, moxa and herbal treatment without cupping would be better, because they work to strengthen the body. Are there any side effects? Those round bruises you have seen in pictures are very common. This is actually a good sign; it shows that blood has been brought to that area and concentrated there. The bruises may last about a week, but they are nothing to worry about. It is also possible that occasionally a blister will form. This, too, shows that fluid has been pulled towards the surface. Blisters should not be popped, just left alone to be absorbed and healed naturally. Obviously, it is crucial that cupping be performed by someone who is trained and experienced with this technique. Care must be taken so that the skin is not burned, and the timing is very important to achieve the desired results. How many cupping treatments would I need? Cupping is not done \"in a vacuum.\" Normally, cupping would be part of a broader treatment, involving acupuncture, herbal formulae, massage, and other modalities. How many treatments you might need depends on the history and severity of your condition. For example, when people go through our One Week Detox Program, they receive 3 treatments combining acupuncture and cupping over a period of 7 days. What do I do after I've had cupping? We advise that people do not bathe or swim for at least 2 hours after a cupping treatment. Also, avoid drinking or eating anything icy cold, or exposing yourself to wind. Stay warm, drink tea. Cupping \"opens up\" channels in the body, allowing energy and fluid to get out. We don't want anything cold and damp \"getting in\" at this time. I'm ready to try cupping! What should I do?
