The wise Hippocrates said, \"let thy food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.\" Health foods are inclusive of natural foods, organic foods, whole foods, and dietary supplements. They have specific benefits such as supporting a balanced diet, reducing the risk of health-related conditions, preventing and treating disease. Given the wondrous benefits, there is an increasing need for health food stores in society. There are a variety throughout Canada, and countless other wellness and vitamin markets.

Health food is a term that has been in use since the 1920's. It refers to a niche of food beneficial to our health and well-being.
