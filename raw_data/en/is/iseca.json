In the last years, medicine has seen a shift from a deperson- alized towards a patient-centered individualized medicine.This, on the one hand, is based on the achievements inthe field of genetics and molecular science fostering anindividually designed drug therapy and treatment tailoring[1].Ontheotherhand,researchonpatient-practitionerinter- action, psychosocial and behavioral conditions of chronicdiseases, and a patient-centered treatment approach hasrevealed that nonpharmacological factors such as empathymightbeessentialparametersfortheoutcomeofthepatient[2].Moreover,complementarytherapiesastraditionalwhole- medical systems (Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicinea.o.) or homeopathy, which according to their definitionare individualized, have attained increasing interest forimproving the patient care, for example, in the treatmentof chronic diseases and pains syndromes. More recently,the combination of conventional medicine, complementarymedicine, and patient-centered approaches has putinto the conceptional frame of \"integrative medicine\" whichcoversthesetopicsadequately[ 3]. The most common and comprehensive definition up to now has been given by the Consortium of Integrative Medicine in 2005. It describes integrative medicine as \"thepractice of medicine that reaffirms the importance of therelationship between practitioner and patient, focuses onthe whole person, is informed by evidence, and makesuse of all appropriate therapeutic approaches, healthcareprofessionals, and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing\" [ 4]. It therefore joins the latest scientific advances with the profound insights of traditional healing systemsand individualized patient care in complementary medicinet or e g a i na n dp r e s e r v eh e a l t ha n dt oe n h a n c es e l f - e ffi c a c yand patient's own capacities to recover from illness and tomaintainhealth. In the last decades, several hospitals have adopted this concept of integrative medicine for the treatment of chronicand acute states of illnesses in an inpatient treatment. Forinstance, Sendelbach et al. (2003) describe the developmentof an inpatient integrative therapies program in a cardiovas-cular tertiary care center [ 5]. Ernst and Ferrer (2009) also reflectontheimplementationofa7-yearintegrativehospitalp r o g r a mi nac a r d i a ch o s p i t a lc e n t e rf r o mt h ev i e w p o i n to fthenursingstaff[ 6]. In almost all cases, these hospitals have integrated one or more complementary disciplines as naturopathy, anthro-posophical medicine, homeopathy, or traditional Chinesemedicine. While, in the USA integrative medicine hasemergedtowardsamarkerforinnovativequalitypatientcare within the last two decades, other countries have a longer tradition in this field [ 7]. In Germany, for instance, the amendmenttotheGermanDrugLawin1976hasrecognizedanthroposophic medicine, homeopathy, and phytotherapyas \"Specific Therapeutic Systems\" [ 8]. opportunities for integrative medicine2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine increased,andspecializedhospitalsandhospitaldepartments started to evaluate their programs also with respect tocomparative cost scenarios [ 9]w h i c ha r en o w a d a y ss t i l l seen as a major goal [ 10]. Thus, several approaches have already entered the platformof in-patientcare in integrativemedicine. A current study of Kligler et al. (2011) found a decrease in the use of medications resulting in substantial cost savings in the care of oncology patients treated with anintegrativein-patientapproachincludingyogatherapy,holis-tic nursing, and healing environment [ 11]. Unfortunately, due to heterogeneity of the approaches and evaluations, themeta-analyses and systematic reviews of such evaluations inmost cases suffer from a lack of comparability of outcomeparameterswithintheseevaluationssofar. Of note, whole-systems evaluation of integrative in- patienttreatmentmightalsobenefitfromasystematicanaly-sisofthepatientcharacteristicsofclinicalpathwaysandflowprocesses between in- and outpatient treatments, which hasbeendescribed[ 12]. Finally, concepts of combining education, teaching, and in-patient integrative treatment can be seen as an importantmilestoneforthedevelopmentofintegrativemedicine.Ifonlystudentsareabletodiscoverandgetsomefirstinsightintothepotentialdifferentperspectivesofmedicineandhealing,theymight be able to argue open-mindedly about the best fittingtherapeutic strategy for the individual patient to regain hisoptimalhealth[ 13]. D e s p i t et h e s ec u r r e n ta c h i e v e m e n t s ,e v a l u a t i o n so ft h e approach of integrative medicine as a whole system and itsinteractions with other services of patient care have only been seen marginally. Thus, the cutting edge for the future development of integrative medicine now is to close the\"evidencegap\"[ 4]andtosummarizeandcommunicatethese findingsofresearchtothepublic,thestakeholders,andpolicymakersofhealthcareauthorities[ 14]. This special issue tries to step into this direction by bringingtogetherevidencefromdifferentperspectives.Apartfrom whole-systems evaluations of hospital programs, coststudies, and findings on educational aspects of integrativemedicine, this issue also covers historical aspects of thedevelopment of integrative medicine and presents the meta-analysesofintegrativeapproaches.Hopefully,science-drivenimplementation of non-reductionistic medical anthropol- ogy, medical education and practitioner-patient-interaction: the example of Anthroposophic inProceedings of the 4th European Conference for Integrative Medicine,Berlin,Germany,October2011.

Patients and Methods Patientswithprovendiagnosisofcommunity-acquiredpneu-monia(CAP),accordingtocurrentguidelines[ 4],whowere treatedwithintheDepartmentofHomeotherapyinHeiden-heim between March 1999 and September 2001 were regis- tered and consecutively divided into five subgroups. There were no further selection criteria, despite the willingnessand consent of the patients, who were requesting integrative treatment.TheDepartmentofHomeotherapyintheHospital ofHeidenheim(TeachingHospitaloftheUniversityofUlm,Germany) looks back on a 65-year experience in practising anthroposophicmedicine(AM)includingabroadspectrum of different applications within the scope of integrativemedicine(IM).Theconceptofintegrativemedicineseeksnot to weigh up conventional and alternative medicine against each other but to optimize both forms of treatment whileintendinganindividualizedapproach[ 14-16,21]. Chart review was carried out focusing on the following parameters: initial clinical symptoms, radiologic features, blood sample tests, and clinical followup. Clinical data were retrospectively reviewed based on the hospital records includingmedicalhistoryandonresultsfromthecontribut-ingradiologistsandlaboratory. Accordingtocurrentguidelines[ 4]thediagnosticcriteria forCAPweretheclinicalpictureofanacutepneumonia,such as possible fever, shivering, cough, phlegm, sputum, chest pain,dyspneainassociationwithincreasedleukocyteand/or CRP levels, and newly manifest infiltration in a chest X-ray[4].Patientswithatypicalmanifestations,particularlyelderly p e o p l e ,w e r ea l s oi n c l u d e di fac l i n i c a lc h a n g eo c c u r r e d , like confusion or mobility impairment which could not beexplained by any other reason, but at the same time a newlymanifest infiltrate had to be spotted on the chest X-ray [4]. All patients who did not fulfill these criteria, who had hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), or who had immunedeficiencywereexcluded.Also,lostoffollowupwasareason fornoninclusion. Results of chest X-rays were reviewed by two\u2014and for this case series reevaluated by additional one\u2014independent consultantradiologist(s)whowereblindedconcerningpriordiagnosisbutconfirmingradiologicalsignsofpneumonia.

All other patients were defined astheCAP-study group : treated either with AM only (group (PSI) was applied in order to indicatetheseveritylevelofpneumonia,dividedintofiveriskclasses[32-35](Table 1). As shown in Table 1, patients are scored between 10 and +30 points for the different parameters.

Discussion Fromthebackgroundofachievinghighcurerates,antibiotictherapy for community-acquiredbacterial pneumoniais the treatmentofchoicetoday.Howeverwithincreasingresistance to antibiotics, unpleasant adverse effects and not least with risingrequestofpatientstobetreatedwithinthescopeofanintegrativeapproach,alternativetreatmentoptionsareunder debate. Moreover, available data in this context is limited within the established medical literature. Therefore, the aimof the presented observational case series is to evaluate the experience in treating community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with anthroposophic medicine (AM) within a highlyspecialized and well-experienced medical unit. The data of the presented observational case series are documenting the availability of an integrative treatment option for the treat-m e n to fC A Pi nh o s p i t a lw i t hg o o da n dc o m p a r a b l er e s u l t sin certain cases, in the context of such a specialized medical unit.Herewith,thepresentedstudyreportsonuniquedataon averyrelevanttopic.However,duetotheretrospectivestudydesign,thesmallnumberofpatients,andamutuallynottobe underestimated selection bias, the weight of conclusions for futuretreatmentstrategiesinbacterialpneumoniasislimited.Therefore, controlled prospective trials remain to further clarify the role of integrative medicine in the treatment of pneumonias.Out of 48 patients with pneumonia, 26 had CAP, and 18 patients out of these were primarily treated with AM (CAP-studygroup,see Figure1andTable 3),whiletwoofthe lattergotadditionalantibiotictreatmentduringtheircourse.The individual anthroposophic treatment (as outlined in Table 4)didsignificantlyreducebodytemperature,CRPlevel (=0.03 ), and white blood cell count, while no statistical differencewithregardtomorbidityormortalitywasobserved(=0.44 ;=0.69 ), but a 2-3-fold longer hospital stay was necessary in comparison to the conventional standardantibiotic treatment of bacterial CAP in the control group[36](Table 7).Thisisinlinewithpublisheddataconcerning the antibiotic treatment of CAP [ 37] ,w h i l et h e r ea r en o comparable studies on CAM or AM regarding inpatient treatmentofCAP.WithintheCAPstudygroup,therewasno pneumonia-relateddeathobserved,andnoneofthepatients neededtobetreatedontheICU.Anyhow,itisquestionable,whether theinvestmentofa multifoldlongerhospitalstay\u2014 a tl e a s tw i t hr e g a r dt ot h ec o s t s \u2014 m i g h tb ea ta n yt i m e convincinginordertosupporttheintegrativeapproachinthemanagement of pneumonia. However, despite the economi- calaspectatfirststep,whichfavourstheantibiotictreatment, there are also critical data on long term adverse effectsin context with antibiotic and antiinflammatory treatments published [ 27-31,38], such as pro-cancerous effects and/or relations to the genesis 27],inbreastcancer[ 31], andalsoinhemato-oncologicaldiseaseslikeacutelymphatic leukaemia [ 30]o rn n - H o d g k i nl y m p h o m a[ 31]. The use of antibiotics and antipyretic drugs seems to play a major role inthedevelopmentofallergiesand/orautoimmunediseases, too [38]. But these long term sequelae of antibiotic and antipyretic/anti-inflammatory drugs as well as a potentialbenefit by using alternative approaches are very difficult toevaluate and therefore remain to be further investigated infuture studies. From the view point of integrative medicine,the intention to mobilize human natural resources of recov-ery (salutogenic approach) should reduce adverse eventsor any other harms to the patients but still remain to beproven yet. Moreover, the rate of recurrence might be asupplemental challenging issue with regard to treatmentefficacyandsustainability.Whetherthecharacterofapproach(integrative and salutogenic or allopathic) may substantiallyinfluencetherecurrencerateofpneumoniaorothersequelaediseases should be s .c. s .c./ p .o . s .c. s .c. s .c. s .c. p .o . p .o . p .o . s .c. p .o . p .o . s .c.

Consecutively, selection criteria which mayindicate secure application of integrative treatment optionsremain also to be further evaluated. In the presented courseof patients with CAP the indication to additionally applyantibioticsappearedwheneverapatientdidnotshowanysignof recovering within three days after onset of treatment (likein two patients of the CAP study group) or if a progressivedeterioration was obvious regarding parameters, such as dyspnea, body temperature, CRP level, or white blood cell count. With regard to the well-validated classification of CAP into different levels of severity (PSI: pneumonia severityindex), 15/18 patients of the CAP-study-group belonged tolower risk classes I-III, and all of these were treated withAMonly( Table 3).TwopatientsofriskclassIVweretreatedwith antibiotics in addition to AM. Finally one patient classified into risk class V could also be treated with AMonly. These data may show the practicability of AM in thetreatment of pneumonia in principle, but neither do thelow number of patients and the retrospective design allowto conclude reliable expectations on treatment results nordo they indicate certain limitations of the anthroposophictherapeuticconcept.Thereforecontrolledprospectivestudiesremain to be performed in order to clarify strengths andlimitations of the integrative approach in the treatment ofpneumonia. Anyhowitisworthtonoticethatevenseverepneumonias might be approachable by applying AM only, as indicated by the patient classified in risk class V.

AM is not intending to get in competition with modern temporary medicine but ratherextending and eventually enriching it. Within a time ofrising professionalised medicine with standardized clinicalpathways there is almost no space for an individual treat-ment finding.

Introduction Natural healing uses the philosophy of naturopathy with a focus on a nature-orientated healthy life style. Naturallyhealing methods are also applied in the therapy of disor-ders and in rehabilitation. They are used in self-care oftenrecommended by nonmedicals and medical practitioners in ambulantsettings.Therearealsospecialclinics,hospitalsfor inhouse treatments. We present the historical developmentof naturopathy with focus on inpatient natural healing withregard to present and future statuses. The asclepion of theancient Greek temple facilities might be referred to as anearly precursor of inpatient treatment with a programmesimilar in many aspects to that of contemporary naturalhealing. Apart from the medicinal water applications adormitorium was also in use for inducing a healing sleep\u2014some similarity might be seen with modern meditation[1]. A dogmatically independent and new development con- trary to the medicine of the time [ 2]w a sc o n s t i t u t e da s late as the beginning of the 19th century; but the namefor this programme was initially hydropathy or in German \"Wasserheilkunde.\" However, in the 18th century there wasalreadyanincreasedinterestinmedicinewithaviewtowardsmild hippocratic approaches of healing, inclusive internaland external water applications, healthy food and physicalexercises,andavoidanceofdangerousandrigorousinterven-tions; all this was related sporadically to the term \"medicinanaturae\"[ 3]. The hydropathic movement developed and was driven mainly by medical laymen [ 4]. About the mid 18th century, this romantic hydropathical movement changed its name toamorepositiveterm,thatis,\"Naturheilkunde\"(naturopathy,art of natural healing). Exercise, nutrition, and later othernatural healing methods like herbal therapy were added tocoldwater.Naturaltreatmentswereprovidedbymedicalandnonmedicalhealers as well as in self-help groupsin both in-andoutpatientsettings.Thiswasincontrasttotheestablishedmedical services\u2014the conventional balneology is included,withitsfocusonspecialandlocallyavailablespatreatments.During the second half of the 19th century spas or hospitalsspecializinginnaturalhealingdevelopedworldwide.2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine The books and quarterly water journal of Eucharius Ferdinand Christian Oertel (1765-1851) and also his firstassociation with hydropathic health were important for thedogmaticandmedicinehostiledevelopment.Similartoothersystems and disciplines of complementary medicine a verybroadsupportofthepopulationwasthereasonforitsgrowth despitestakeholdersinmedicineandgovernments.

Methods The content of this relies on the literature reviewin AR96 (Deutsches (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials),CDAR94 (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects),CDSR93 (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews),CV72 (CAB (with case insensitivity). The searches produced4 8 ,r e s p e c t i v e l y ,8 9 ,t o g e t h e r1 3 7h i t s .A ft e re l i m i n a t i o no fdouble or multiple hits of the same source 85 hits remained.39 papers were excluded from further evaluation becausethey did not examine the naturopathic inpatient treatmentaccording to their titles and abstracts. Another 25 sourceswere excluded by full-text analysis for the same reason orbecause they were only concerned with the naturopathicinpatient treatment of a special condition or disease. The remaining 11 papers, supplemented by own additional literature, which included already 9 of the 11 papers foundby the systematic search, were used to elaborate the contentof this paper. A previous published historical review of thedevelopment of naturopathic inpatient treatment was notfound. 3. First Naturopathic Inpatient Facilities The first and famous cold-water establishment was devel-oped by the farmer Vinzenz Prie\u00dfnitz in 5]. Prie\u00dfnitz opened his cold-water spa in 1822. He treated 45 patients in 1829, 500patients in 1837, and two years later there were already 1700patients, among them 120 physicians. The diagnoses of hisp a t i e n t sd u r i n gt h ey e a r s1 8 2 9t o1 8 3 9a r ea n a l y s e da n ddescriptivelyreportedbySajnerandK r\u00b4zek[6]. Some time later, hydrotherapy was extended by certain forms of nutrition therapy. Johann Schroth (1798-1856), aschoolfellow of Prie\u00dfnitz, was striving for the concept of thePrie\u00dfnitz's water establishments and founded his own cure establishment in the nearby Niederlindewiese, where, alongwith warm water applications, he introduced a fasting curewith alternative days of drinking large amounts of wine orwater fluid and days without drinking at all [ 7]. Later on, ideas of vegetarianism were incorporated in the movement ofnaturopathy. The term \"Naturheilkunde\" (naturopathy) was initially introducedbytheforestgeometerJ .H.RaussealiasHeinrichF. Francke (1805-1848). Later the Bavarian physician Lorenz Gleich (1798-1865),a radical representative of hydropathy and naturopathy andin strong opposition to conventional medicine [ 8,9]. He could also accommodate some patients in and alongside hishydropathical facility in the south of Munich. Apart fromhydrotherapy,therewerealsonutritionandphysicalexercisetherapiesapplied. The further development included a systematic use of light, air, and the sun introduced by the so-called \"sun-apostle\"[10],ArnoldRikli(1823-1906)[ 11]andlateronbythe open-airfanatic,AdolfJust(1859-1936)[ 12].Theyappliedthe wholespectrumofthenaturalcurefactorsintheirair-cottageparks:AdolfJustistodayknownasarediscovererofinternalandexternaltreatmentswith\"Heilerde\"(healingclay)[ 4]. Hydropathical-orientatednaturopathycouldnotdevelop widely accepted level until the 1870s,withanexceptionofabroadactivemovementofnaturopathyin Saxony, where the physician Heinrich Lahmann (1860-1905) resumed the leadership of Zimmermann's notableestablishment of true naturopathy in Chemnitz in 1886. However, two years later Bergmann opened his own facility fornaturopathy(Wei\u00dferHirsch)nearDresden. 4. The Kneipp Movement A true renaissance of naturopathy all-over Germany andbeyond started with the Catholic priest Sebastian Kneipp(1821-1897). His bestseller \"My Water Cure\" (1886) wasintended to reduce personal provision of the treatment.H o w e v e r ,t h eo p p o s i t eh a p p e n e d( i n1 8 8 9o v e r2 , 6 0 0 ,1 8 9 2over 12,000 patients in W \u00a8orishofen). Using donations by his patients, Kneipp established several hospitals \"Sebas-tianeum,\" \"Kneipp's healing facility for children\", and the\"Kneippianum.\" The last was managed like a hospital bythe Kneipp physician Alfred Baumgarten (1862-1924) who startedin1894. The first Kneipp association was established in W\u00a8orishofen in 1891 and later named \"Stamm-Kneipp- Verein\" (Original Kneipp Society). The development of other local societies followed rapidly. The \"Verein der \u00a8Arzte establishedin1894. his recommendation of a much shorter cold water stimulus,which led to a better initial reaction and better long-termresults. Kneipp introduced affusions (from a watering canwithout sprinkling head or from a wide mouthed rubberEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 tube). Kneipp did not only\u2014as could be assumed from the title of his book \"My Water Cure\"\u2014focus on hydrotherapy(Part1ofhisbook),butalsocombinedhiswatertherapywithherbal medicine. This was heavily criticised by other hydro-therapists and naturopathists, while they assumed a \"badcompromise\" that would detract patients from their strict self-healing process and soften the cure too much. Addi- tionally, Kneipp combined water and herbs with exercise,diet,andguidelinestohealthyandhappylife,speciallyinhisfurtherbooks\"ThusShaltThouLive\"(1889)and\"MyWillforHealthy and Sick\" (1894). Diseases were described very simply and clearly: they originate either because of dysfunction of blood compositesorcirculatorydisturbance.Accordingly,atherapysucceededdue to liquidation of obstruction or here of aroused harmfulsubstances and their discharge and secretion. The cause ofsensibilityandsusceptibilityforgettingsickistheabsentself-purification. Regardingthediet,Kneippappearednottoberadicaland puritan but rather praised the inartificial plain fare; clothingshouldnotberestrictive;omittingfootwearpreventsdrivingblood up in a harmful way. The skilled weaver was againstwoollen clothes touching skin directly and preferred linenbecause of its rub effect. A fresh and unspoiled air wasimportantaswell. The \"five columns,\" which nowadays are accredited to Kneipp, do not originate directly from him. They are for-mulated after 1950 by the Kneipp physician Josef H. Kaiser,and they include water, nutrition, physical exercise, herbaltreatments, and \"Ordnung\" (balance of life or today: mind andbody). Kneippwasatthetimereluctantlynoticedbytheconven- tional academically minded medical establishment and, forexample, ignored by Wilhelm Winternitz (1834-1917), whoconsidered himself a successor of the long, since deceased,Prie\u00dfnitz. He was also looked down upon by Ferdinand v.Ziemssen of Munich hospital. In fact the academic writingsofProfessorWinternitzfrom1877nevergarneredsuchpublicattentionasthebooksofthe\"simple\"priest. In 1889, the Jordan bath\u2014the first Kneipp bath outside W\u00a8orishofen\u2014was opened under leadership of Dr. Johann Nepomuk St \u00a8utzle (1858-1938). Though numerous Kneipp establishments were founded, only some of them are still inoperationliketheoneatBrixen(nowItaly),foundedin1890byOttoV.Guggenberg(1848-1914). Another core area of naturopathy was Dresden and Saxony. The physician Paul Kadner (1818-1868) had openedt h efi r s td i e tc u r ee s t a b l i s h m e n tw h i c hh a d2 0b e d sa se a r l yas 1861. Later his brother-in-law Felix Klees (1832-1899)continued with focus on the Schroth cure. The physicianHeinrich Lahmann (1860-1905), who served as head of abig naturopathic facility in Chemnitz before, established theleading sanatorium in the spa town Wei\u00dfer Hirsch at Dres-den. Over 2000 patients were treated there in 1900. Several other health hospitals were situated in the neighbourhood and in the area around Dresden, part of which operatingundercontrolofphysicians[ 13]. At the turn of century, greater political pressure was exerteduponmedicinetousenaturopathytoagreaterextent.This appeared under the newly established branch of med- ical science \"physical-dietary medicine\" which ranged fromhydrotherapy, massage, and remedial gymnastics to diet.NeitherthemedicinalherbsintroducedbyKneippnorsomefurther specific ideas and treatments of naturopathy wererecognizedbythemedicalapproach. 5. First Academic Naturopathy ErnstSchweninger(1850-1924)[ 14,15]wasappointedprofes- sorfordermatologyafterhissuccessfultreatmentofBismarckin1884-1900,andduring1900-1906,hewasheadofthefirstGermanhospitalofnaturopathyinBerlin-Gro\u00df-LichterfeldeassociatedwiththeCharit \u00b4e[16]. Schweningertreated8,359patientsinGro\u00df-Lichterfelde, administering 262, 118 treatment days. Among those therewere 479 consumptive patients (i.e. mainly tuberculosis),264 acute joint-rheumatic patients, 219 gastro patients, 210diphtheria cases, 165 scarlatina cases, 155 heart cases, 129 cases, 113 eczema cases, 104pneumoniacases,72redmurraincases,45rubeolacases,34 psoriasiscases,27typhuscases,and16pertussiscases[ 17].

Additionally, since 1901, there existed a hydrotherapic facilityattheCharit \u00b4eunderProfessorLudwigBrieger(1849- 1919), who later also held the chair for general therapy [ 18].

At the time, thisconsisted of a polyclinic with surgeries and a small hospitaldepartmentwithjust20beds.25,000patientsweremedicatedwithin nine years. Most were from a poverty stricken back-ground from the north of Berlin. About 100 women and 50m e nw e r et r e a t e di nt h eb a t hf a c i l i t i e sd a i l y .2 5 0 , 0 0 0w a t e rapplications were applied according to the prescriptions ofphysicians during that time. 56,000 patients were visitingthe so-called \"electrical department.\" The department forSwedishremedialgymnasticsandmassagewasreestablishedin 1921, were provided within eightyears.

In 1924, a second university department for naturopathy wasopenedattheFriedrich-SchillerUniversityinJena.ErnstKlein[21]wasthefirstprofessorfornaturopathy. The first teaching hospital of naturopathy with 75 beds, the Prie\u00dfnitz hospital in Berlin Mahlow, was establishedin 1927 and affiliated with the natural healing departmentof Professor Sch \u00a8onenberger. The public acceptance was so great that the patients waited several months for admission.4 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine The therapeutic measures described by Brauchle [ 18] included uncooked vegetarian food according to Bircher-Benner(1867-1939)[ 22],coldwaterhydrotherapyaccording to Prie\u00dfnitz and Kneipp, warm applications according toSchweninger, and air and sun baths according to Rikli[10,11]a n dL a h m a n n[ 23], as well as the Schroth cure in a moderate variant. Additionally, the fasting cure, massage, and gymnastics played a significant role. The successor wasAlfred Brauchle (1898-1964) who stayed there until he leftforDresden. 6. ''New German Medicine'' Naturopathy was abused under the state dictatorship ofnational socialism during the third Reich and was part ofthe intended \"New German Medicine.\" Different medicalareas such as naturopathy, homeopathy, and biochemistryby Sch\u00a8u\u00dfler, the last mostly due to the impressive number of members in the nonmedical societies, were put togetherunder \"biological methods.\" The anthroposophy was, how-ever,labelledas\"degenerated\"andforbidden. Ernst Klein in Jena was dismissed in 1933. The successor ofKleinwasthepartypoliticallyactiveKarlK \u00a8otschau(1892- 1945). The department of true naturopathy at the Univer-sity of Jena was transformed under his leadership from apolyclinic for naturally healing systems into the \"Clinic andPolyclinicforBiologicalMedicine\"[ 24].

Louis Redcliff Grote (1886-1960) wasnominated as the head of the hospital for internal medicinewithabout300beds.Inparallel,thehospitalfornaturopathywas subordinated to Brauchle and comprised after its exten-sionabout250beds[ 25,26]. Hydrotherapy, massage and gymnastics, and air and sun baths, as well as the upcoming psychotherapy (according toCou\u00b4e und Wetterstrand) were applied in Brauchle's Depart- ment. Clinical visits were arranged during daily air baths. Regular meetings of medical staff were held. They were therapeutically supervised by a physician of the ward of thetrue naturopathic department and assisted by an internistassigned for diagnostic advisory [ 18,27]. Both departments haddailyrotatingadmissionshifts.Thepeopletreatedrangedfrom patients with internal diseases as well as patients ofconservative gynecology, orthopedics, neurology, and der-matology.Brauchle andGrote performedassociated visitsatthecommonwardwhichwasthecoreplaceforcriticaldialogsregardingspecificcases. Thetreatmentwaspurposelyalignedwithsimplicityand manageability in order to evaluate the effects of natu-rallyhealingsystemsunderthepreconditionsofalarge-scalehospital. After the initial examination, a treatment program was developed by the team of true naturopathic physicians.Medicationwasgivenonlywiththeobjectivetoimprovetheprospectiveeffectofphysical-dietarytherapy. Relaxationtechniqueswereadministratedtoallpatients. Regular lectures of the physicians to public health, detailed final meetings with proposals for individual arrangements, anddailyhydrotherapywerealsoavailablefortheinpatients. According to Krau\u00df [ 27] the duration of stay in the hos- pital for true naturopathy lasted 22 days, in the departmentof Grote 21 days. The average costs of medication were 35Pfennig per day at Grote and between 4-6 Pfennig per dayatBrauchle(skinoilsandherbalteasincluded). The difference of total costs was due to different usage of medication, number of nurses, and therapeutic staff. Itwas also dependent on complexity of laboratory-technicalwork.Nodocumentationofdailypersonnelcostsduringthe\"experiment of Dresden\", which reassesses the methods ofnaturopathy[ 28],isavailable. In accordance with the political development Brauchle elaborated at the beginning of the forties his psychologicalcollectivetreatmentintoaformofmasssuggestion(\"Massen-suggestion\")[ 29]. DeathwasdeclaredbyBrauchleas\"bestcure\"forpatients when naturopathic methods could not help them [ 28]\u2014a cynicalpointofview. After 1942, the deteriorating general situation during the second world war stopped the harmonic cooperation ofBrauchleandGrote[ 30]. The occupation of naturopathy by national socialism recharged the beginning of academic recognition which naturopathy gained at 1920 (chair for naturopathy at thecharit\u00b4e) and 1924 (chair for naturopathy at the Friedrich- SchillerUniversityJena)[ 31]. A number of naturopathic departments and Kneipp's departmentsatmunicipalhospitalswere,however,operatingfurther up to 50s or 60s when new techniques and newspecificmedicationreplacedthem. 7.

Evaluation of Naturopathy in History Different ways to describe and evaluate naturopathic treat- mentinhistoryuptonowaredelineatedin Table 2. Though naturopathy and conventional medicine were directlycompared\"sidebyside\"alreadyinthethirtiesofthelast century at Dresden, the published results are academicconversations but no comparable physical or psychologicalmeasurements[ 25,26].Comparisonofnaturopathyandcon- ventional medicine remains difficult. Only one study existswhich compares treatment results between naturopathicand conventional orthopaedic, respectively, rheumatologictreatment[ 46].Becausethisstudycouldnotrandomlyassign the patients to the treatment groups, interpretation of theresults is difficult. Nevertheless naturopathy seems to be atl e a s ta se ff e c t i v ea sc o n v e n t i o n a lo r t h o p a e d i c ,r e s p e c t i v e l y ,rheumatologic treatment. All other modern studies evalu-ating naturopathic treatment on the whole are one-armedcohortstudieswithoutcontrolgroup. 9. Discussion and Conclusions Naturopathic hospitals have always tried to evaluate theirresults. Outcome research was a central issue of inpatientnaturopathictreatment.Kusche [ 16] already compared costs of patient-centered healthcarelike\"integrierteVersorgung\"inGermanyempha- size and underline the importance of this type of research.Newer studies use standardized questionnaires to measuretheeffectsofnaturopathicinpatienttreatment[ 36-41]allow- ing for more objective measurement of effects in outcomeresearch. Only one modern study was able to comparenaturopathicinpatienttreatmentwithconventionalminimalinvasiveorthopedic,respectively,rheumatologictreatment.The future development of the inpatient treatment with naturopathy in Germany is uncertain at this time, espe-cially due to discussions on the Law on Modernization of Public Health and decreasing financial resources in public health sector. Also the adopted system of case allowances(DRG-System)complicatestheaccountingofnaturalhealingtreatments in the hospital. The classical naturally healingsystems propose ideal prerequisites for prevention and com-plementary treatment of numerous diseases.

Conclusion . Our results indicate that incorporating students in an integrative healthcare setting may result in greater patient centeredness. Further studies are needed to determine whether this is due to organizational advantages,students'empathicactivity,theimpactofteaching,orlearner-teacherinteraction. 1. Introduction Overthelasttwodecades,increasedattentionhasbeengiven totheconceptofactivelearnerparticipationintheso-called\"community of practice\" [ 1,2]. Studies have suggested that apart from the explicit knowledge typically taught in theclassroom, learners must also acquire certain implicit skillsand knowledge within their future workplace. In addition,active participation in patient care in particular seems toplay a crucial role in the acquisition of professional andinterpersonal competencies and the development of a sense ofroleidentity[ 3]. In the field of medicine, active student participation (ASP) typically takes place during clinical clerkships andfinal-year rotations. However, from different studies, weknow that participation in clinical rotations alone does notnecessarily automatically result in the professional develop-ment of learners. Instead, it is the degree of active partic-ipation (as opposed to being involved in primarily passivelearning experiences) together with certain qualities of the2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine learning environment that determine the success of clinical education [ 3,4]. In Germany, for example, medical students are usually required to do three 16-week final-year rotationsin internal medicine, surgery, and one field of their choice.However,asinothercountries[ 4,5],theeducationalquality of these rotations has been criticized as being suboptimal. Students tend to be provided with mere passive experiences rather than actively participating in patient care. They areall too often assigned routine tasks, and do not receivesufficientclinicalsupervision.Theseshortcomingshavebeenshowntoleadtoinsufficienttrainingofindependentpatientmanagement and to feelings of uncertainty among medicalstudents[ 6]. Inresponsetothesedeficitsandinordertoofferstudents a structured clinical learning environment tailored to theirlearning needs, the Clinical Education Ward for IntegrativeMedicine (CEWIM) was established in 2007 and imple-m e n t e di n t oo n eo ft h ew a r d so ft h eD e p a r t m e n to fI n t e r -nal Medicine at the Gemeinschaftskrankenhaus Herdecke(GKH), an academic teaching hospital of Witten/HerdeckeUniversity in Germany. The two main aims of the CEWIMare [7] (1) to promote ASP in clinical patient care while providing students with close supervision and (2) to helpstudentslearnandpracticeintegrativemedicine(inthiscase,to complement conventional medicine with anthroposophicmedicine[ 8]). While most studies investigating ASP focus on its edu- cational value for learners, few have explored its potentialinfluence on the community of practice and on the learners'work, including quality of care. The findings of such studies have indicated that ASP may also be of benefit to patients, since they gain a better understanding of their disease [ 9] a n da r em o r es a t i s fi e dt h a tt h e i rn e e d sh a v eb e e nm e t[ 10]. ThisraisesthequestionwhetherASPhasaneffectonpatientcenteredness,whichtheInstituteofMedicinedefinesas\"pro-viding care that is respectful of and responsive to individualpatient preferences, needs and values, and ensuring thatpatientvaluesguideallclinicaldecisions\"([ 11],page40).The aimofthepresentstudywas,therefore,todeterminewhetherA S Ph a sac e rta i ni m pa cto nq u al i t yo fc a r ei na ni n t e gr a ti v einpatientsetting.Morespecifically ,wewishedtocomparetheexperiencesofpatientsontheCEWIMtothoseofpatientsontheregularinternalmedicinewardsattheGKHwithrespecttothefollowingaspectsofpatientcenteredness: (a) physician-patientinteraction, (b) physician empathy, defined as a specific ability to communicate and help patients based on a deeperunderstanding of their situation, their perspectives,andtheirfeelings[ 12], (c) patient enablement, defined as the extent to which a patientfeelsempoweredafteramedicalconsultation, in terms of being able to cope with, understand, andmanagetheirillness[ 13]). 2. Methods 2.1.ClinicalSetting. TheDepartmentofInternalMedicineat theGKH,whichoffersthesamediagnosticandinterventionalservices as a regional hospital (including an intensive care unit), is divided into three different wards: one short-term wardwith 20 beds, which is mainly for patients with fewer symptoms and less severe diseases (average stay: 4.5 days),and two long-term wards for patients with more complex and severe diseases. Particularly on these long-term wards, there are patients with specific interest in complementary medicine.Oneofthetwolong-termwardsismorespecializedin oncological and palliative care (26 beds; average stay:9.9 days); other is focused on gastroenterological andcardiological care (36 beds; average stay: 11.2 days). TheCEWIM was incorporated into the latter medical ward,u s i n g1 0t o1 2o ft h ew a r d ' s3 6b e d s .O nt h eC E W I M ,f o u rto five students take over the work of one house officeron the ward, meaning that together they are responsiblefor the care of a total of 10 to 12 patients. The studentsa r es u p p o r t e da n ds u p e r v i s e db yt h eh o u s eo ffi c e ra n daconsultant. Important decisions, such as making changes toapatient'smedicationorarrangingdiagnosticinterventions,may only be made after consultation and in agreementwith the two supervising physicians. Students' care of thepatients on the ward involves the usual diagnostic andtherapeuticproceduresperformedonaconventionalmedicalward as well as complementary medicine being offered tointerested patients. Based on a holistic view of the patient,students provide conventional and specific complementarytreatments, such as natural remedies, rhythmic massage,external applications, art therapy, therapeutic eurythmy (aform of meditative movement), and biographic counseling[8].StudentrotationsontheCEWIMare16weeksinduration andhavetakenplacetwiceayeareachyearsince2009. 2.2. Educational Setting. Originally launched as a pilot project in 2007, the CEWIM became a permanent programi n2 0 0 9 .Th eC E W I Mi sp a r to ft h eI n t e g r a t e dC u r r i c u -lum of Anthroposophic Medicine (ICURAM), an optionalprogram in anthroposophic medicine that is integrated into the full six-year program of the regular undergraduate medicalcurriculumatWitten/HerdeckeUniversity[ 14].The main goal of the ICURAM program is to emphasize abroader, multifaceted, and holistic view of human beingsand to prepare students for patient-centered integrative andanthroposophic care. In order to achieve this goal, learner-centered educational strategies and learning objectives weredevelopedinclosecontactandtogetherwithstudents.Thesestrategies have been summarized into what is called the 2approach, which combines exploratory learning, supportedparticipation,patient-orientedlearning,reflectivepractice, integrated learning, an integrative approach, andteam-oriented learning [ 14]. The CEWIM was developed based on this approach. Apart from providing students withclinical training through ASP, it also offers students specificlearningopportunities. (i) Studentslearnhowtointegratethedifferentperspec- tivesandtreatmentoptionsofconventionalmedicineandcomplementaryanthroposophicmedicineandtoappreciate the specific values and limitations of eachapproach.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3 (ii) Studentsareinvolvedininterprofessionallearningby being fully integrated into the healthcare team andbyworkingtogetherwithnursesandhealthcareprac-titioners practicing art therapy, music therapy, ther-apeutic eurythmy, massage, physiotherapy, and psy-chotherapy.Interprofessionallearningisenhancedby an interprofessional module (held during Week 1), weekly team meetings with therapists, and monthlymeetingswiththenursingteam. (iii) Reflective practice is promoted through a clinical reflectiontrainingseminar[ 15]heldeverytwoweeks with a professional supervisor. During the seminar,studentsreflectonchallengingsituationsfacedduringtheirrotation,suchasinteractionswithpatients,diffi-cultiesworkingwithteammembers,andprofessionalself-managementissues.Thisseminarwasdevelopedbecause participating students had expressed thedesirefortheopportunitytoprocessanddiscusstheirsometimesdifficultexperiencesandtheirprofessionaldevelopment. 2.3. Research Instruments. The following instruments were used to evaluate and compare the perceived quality of carereceived by patients of the CEWIM and by patients of theregular \"nonstudent\" wards of the Department of InternalMedicineattheGKH. (i)The Picker Inpatient Questionnaire (PIQ). Originally developed in the USA by Cleary et al., the PIQwas accredited in 1997 by the Joint Commission forAccreditation of Health Care Organizations [ 16,17]. Patients surveyed using the PIQ are asked to reporttheir experience with specific events and processesin the hospital. The questionnaire includes eightquestions on patient-physician interaction as wellas two general quality items, for example, askingpatientswhethertheyhaverecommendedtheirwardtofriendsandrelatives.Forthepurposeofourstudy,t h eG e r m a nv e r s i o no ft h eP I Qw a su s e d .W ea l s osupplementedthePIQwithadditionalitemsinorder to assess specific qualities of integrative care and anthroposophicmedicine. (ii)The Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) Questionnaire. D e v e l o p e db yM e r c e re ta l .[ 18]a s a patient-reported outcome measure for physicianempathy, the CARE contains 10 items, all beginningwith the words \"how was the doctor at...\" (\"reallylistening,\" \"making you feel at ease,\" etc.). For thepurpose of our study, the German version of theCAREmeasurewasused.TheoriginalEnglishversionshowed good internal validity (Cronbach's alpha:0.92)andfacevalidity[ 18].EvaluationoftheGerman versionconfirmedthattheone-dimensionalstructureof the original English version had been replicated[19]. (iii)The Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI). Developed by Howie et al. [ 13], this six-item questionnaire asks patients whether as a result of their visit to theirdoctor they feel they are able to understand their illness, help themselves, and so forth. Since we usedthe questionnaire for the evaluation of a clinical stay,werewordedthefirstpartofeachoftheseitemstosay\"As a result of the treatment received at the hospital,doyoufeelyouare....\"TheGermanversionofthePEI wasusedinthestudy[ 20]. (iv) Patients of the CEWIM were also asked to rate whether student participation on the ward had apositive,neutral,ornegativeimpactontheircare. To ensure that medical students were included in the patients'assessmentsofthequalityofcaretheyreceived,theword \"physician\" was replaced with the phrase \"the team ofphysicians\" in all relevant questions. A note was also madethatstudentsshouldbeconsideredapartofthisteam. 2.4. Sampling. To evaluate the perceived quality of care received on the CEWIM, a survey was conducted of allpatients that had been treated by four cohorts of medicalstudentsbetweenthefallof2010andthesummerof2012.Allpatients meeting the inclusion criteria ( n=2 1 5 ,s e e Table 1) were surveyed by anonymous written questionnaire withineight weeks after their discharge. Completed questionnaireswere then sent back to the Picker Institute, Germany, wherethe data were sampled and a preliminary analysis was per-formed. The perceived quality of care received by patients of the regularinternalmedicinewards(controlgroup, n=250)was assessedusingresultstakenfromthemostrecentlyconductedroutine evaluation of the GKH. Every two years, the GKHundergoes an evaluation, the last of which was conductedin the fall of 2011 over a period of two months. The datacollection procedure and the questionnaires used for theroutine GKH evaluation are the same as those used for theCEWIMpatientsurvey. 2.5. Statistical Analysis.

Discussion The aim of our study was to determine whether there is a difference in the quality of care experienced by patients onthe CEWIM, where students actively participate in patientcare, and wards of the same department where students aren o ti n v o l v e di nc a r e .I np a r t i c u l a r ,w ew e r ei n t e r e s t e di nwhether ASP has an impact on certain qualities of patientcenteredness, namely, patient-physician interaction in gen-eral,perceivedphysicianempathy,andpatientenablement. The results of our study indicate that while ASP\u2014as i m p l e m e n t e do nt h eC E W I M \u2014 h a sn os i g n i fi c a n ti m p a c to nthesuccessofmedicaltreatmentintermsoftheimprovementof complaints or the rate of reported complications afterdischarge, it does improve patient-physician interaction,physician empathy, and patient enablement. The CEWIMalso fared better than the control group wards in otherareas which are specific to integrative medicine; namely,the practice of holistic and humanistic medicine, a notice-able anthroposophic orientation, and collaboration betweenhealthcareprofessionals. A preliminary study of the initial two-rotation pilot phase of the CEWIM [ 21] had found the patient-physician relationshiptoberatedbetterbypatientsontheCEWIMthanby patients on the same medical ward at the GKH withoutASP (control group 1) and by patients from conventionalinternal medicine wards in Germany (control group 2).However, only the difference between the CEWIM andcontrol group 2 was found to be statistically significant. Itwas,therefore,impossibletodeterminewhetherthepositiveassessmentsofphysician-patientinteractionontheCEWIMweretheresultofASPonthewardorwhethertheyaremerelyattributabletothemedicalsettingattheGKH.Explorationofadditionally collected qualitative data did, however, indicatethatcareontheCEWIMwasperceivedasmoreholisticand individualized. By including a greater number of patients and students in the present study, it was possible to detect a significantdifferencebetweentheCEWIMandtheGKHmedicalwardswithout ASP, in particular with regard to certain qualities of patientcenteredness.Theresultsofourstudyseemsurprising giventhatpatientstendtoprefertobetreatedbyexperiencedprofessionals rather than by students still in medical school.This preference is, of course, understandable, since studentstendtobemoreuncertainofthemselves,slower,overstrainedat an earlier stage, and need more time and attempts toperform most procedures and practical tasks (e.g., insertingan IV catheter or performing a physical examination). Itis also assumed that resident physicians and fully licensedphysicianshavegreaterpracticalknowledgeandarebetterinotherareas,suchastimemanagement,clinicalthinking,andclinicaldecisionmaking. Severalhypothesescanbeofferedtoexplainwhypatients' ratingsofpatientcenterednesswerehigherontheCEWIM. (1)Organizational Advantages. Since students are responsibleforthecareoffewerpatientsthanregularphysicians, they can dedicate more time to theirpatients.Inaddition,unlikephysiciansontheregularwards, students on the CEWIM do not have nightshifts and are continuously on the ward. These twoorganizational advantages may be reflected in thebetter PIQ scores for \"physician availability\" and\"having a clearly assigned physician.\" Similarly, a n o t h e rs t u d yf o u n dt i m ea n dp h y s i c i a na v a i l a b i l i t y to have a comparable positive effect on patients'assessments of physician empathy among patientswithprivatehealthinsurance[ 21]. (2)Specific Qualities of Student Communication with Patients.The results of the CARE questionnaire sug- gestthatpatientsontheCEWIMfoundstudentstobebetteratlettingthemtelltheirstory,atreallylistening,and at being interested in them as a whole person.These aspects require not only dedicating more timeto patients but also motivation, an open interest inanother person, and a high level of commitment.Theseoutcomesonempathyaresupportedbythebet-terPIQscoresfor\"enoughfriendliness,\"\"relationshipof trust,\" and \"possibility to talk about fears\" in theCEWIM group. Moreover, patients on the CEWIMmore frequently reported receiving \"understandableanswers to important questions,\" which could beexplained by the fact that students still tend to usemoreeverydaylanguageinsteadofmedicalterms. (3)The Impact of Teaching and Supervision. On the CEWIM, student learning is promoted throughreflection and discussion on the daily problems andtasks associated with each of the students' patients.In addition to the usual ward rounds and seminars,students participate in weekly teaching rounds andintegrative case conferences. These activities givestudents opportunities to dedicate greater focus toindividual patient cases and find optimal solutions6 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine CG CEWIMPercentage0 10 20 30 40 50 60Hospital not recommended to others(3) Medical treatment unsuccessful(2) Complications after discharge(1) No improvement of complaintsTreatment unsuccessful (mean 1 -3) Poor overall care Problematic collaboration betweenHumanistic and holistic medicine hardly perceptible Figure1:FrequencyofproblemswithgeneralaspectsofintegrativecareasreportedbyCEWIMpatientsandtheCG.Notethatindicatesa significantdifferencebetweentheCEWIMandtheCGwards;analysisofcovariance(ANCOVA), <0.05;0.01.

In other words, they have more time to work through cases thoroughly and consci-entiously than a regular physician would have.

Beingasked to act as a role model may also promote betterandmorecomprehensiveperformance. The results of our study correspond with those of other studies, which have found ASP to have a positive impacton patient care. A study by Coleman and Murray, forexample, found that patients enjoyed being involved in acommunity-based teaching program, had acquired greaterknowledge about their disease, had enhanced self-esteem,andfeltthattheservicetheyreceivedwasbetter[ 9].Patients treated on an interprofessional clinical education ward inLondon [ 10] indicated being more satisfied than patients on a conventional ward with the care they received. They feltthat students had communicated better in terms of activelistening and answering their questions. Greater motivationand enthusiasm on the part of students were also seen as arelevant factor contributing to higher satisfaction with theeducationward. Although,asthisstudyhasshown,ASPplaysasignificant role in perceived qualityof care, it is alsovitalto provide theproper learning environment that supports students duringtheir participation on the ward. Various studies have shownthatempathyandpatientcenterednesstendtodeclineduringp a r t i c i p a t i o ni nc l i n i c a le d u c a t i o na n di nr e s i d e n c y[ 22]. While the reasons for this are still not fully clear, it seemsthat the process of adaptation to the contemporary culture ofclinicalpracticemayleadtoamoreeffectiveandfocused, yet less patient-oriented, attitude. Qualities of empathy andpatient centeredness may therefore be stronger at the begin-ning of clinical education. Carmel and Glick, for example,analyzed the characteristics of compassionate and empathicphysicians and found a significant correlation with youngerage and fewer years of medical experience [ 23]. Studies on residents, on the other hand, have reported higher levels ofstress, depression, and burnout in residents [ 24,25], all of whichleadtolesspatient-centeredandempathicinteractionwith patients. A qualitative study from Belgium describespatientcenterednessasbeingnegativelyaffectedbytirednessand perceived time pressure, by nonpatient-centered rolemodels,andbyfeelingoverwhelmedbypowerfulexperiences [26]. Thanks to the learning environment provided on the CEWIM, medical students still experience a sense of secu-rity and assurance while working under close supervision;the additional attendance and perceived learned-centeredapproach may make it easier for them to practice patient- centeredcare. 4.1. Strength and Limitations. Both the CEWIM patient group and the control group were comparable in size (103versus 94 patients), sex, insurance status, health status, andduration of disease. A possible explanation for the lowerresponse rate of the control group compared to the CEWIMpatientgroups(38%versus48%)maybethatthisgrouphadmore older age patients and more patients with dementia,making it more difficult for them to complete a writtensurvey. The fact that more of the CEWIM patients weresatisfiedwiththeircaremayhavealsocontributedtoahigherresponserate.Thelowerpercentageofpatientsinthecontrolgroup with an interest in anthroposophic medicine reflectsthe fact that two of the three internal medicine wards at the GKH offer a greater range of complementary therapies. The \"short-term ward\" does not offer so many art therapies andother nonphysician therapies. The number of patients withaninterestinanthroposophicmedicinewasthereforehigheron the CEWIM than on the control group wards, one of thereasons why it was important to control for different patientcharacteristicsaspartofourstudy . Since the long-term wards have more patients with a specific interest in anthroposophic medicine, it may be thattheresultinghigheramountofpatientsobtainingmorecom-plementarynonphysiciantherapiesledtogreatersatisfactionwith the CEWIM. However, inclusion of the patient char-acteristic \"number of nonphysician therapies obtained\" as acovariate did not change the significance of the differencesin quality of care found between the two patient groups.Furthermore,80%oftheCEWIMpatientsratedtheimpactofstudentparticipationontheircareaspositivewhileonlyoneoutofthe103CEWIMpatientsreportedittohaveasomewhatnegativeinfluence. 5. Implications for Future Research The results of this study suggest that ASP has a positiveeffect on perceived patient centeredness. Further studies are neededtodeterminewhethersimilarresultscanbeobserved in other contexts, such as in other clinical specialties or inconventional hospitals. A comprehensive economic analysisis also desired to assess cost intensiveness of the CEWIMcomparedtoaregularward.Also,moreresearchisnecessarytoanalyzethespecificconditionsofthelearningenvironmentenablingapositiveinfluenceofASPonthequalityofcare. 6. Conclusion Our study shows that ASP may enhance patient-physicianinteraction, physician empathy, and patient enablement. Inaddition, our findings suggest that the relationship between8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine students and the community of practice is not just a one- way street. Active student participation in the communityis of benefit both to students and to the healthcare teamand patients. Student participation and the establishmentof a favorable and supportive learning environment maythereforebeconsideredfactorswhichcanbeusedtoimprove t h ec a r ep r o v i d e db yf u t u r eh e a l t h c a r et e a m sp r a c t i c i n g integrativemedicine.

However, the provision of AMC leads to a prolonged length of stay andcannotbeadequatelyreimbursedbythecurrentG-DRGsystem.Duetotheheterogeneityofthepatientpopulation,anadditional paymentshouldbenegotiatedindividually. 1. Introduction Integrative medicine according the US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine \"combinestreatmentsfromconventionalmedicineandcomplementarymedicine (CAM) for which there is some high-quality evi-dence of safety and effectiveness\" [ 1]. One of the approaches which fits this definition is anthroposophic medicine (AM)e s t a b l i s h e di nt h e1 9 2 0 sb yR u d o l fS t e i n e ra n dI t aW e g m a nalong with some other doctors [ 2]. In the last decades, AM has developed to become one of the main representatives ofintegrative medicine in Germany and is currently practisedinover60countries[ 3]. Furthermore, it is explicitly designated and mentioned in the German Drug Law as a \"Special Therapeutic Sys-tem\" alongside herbal medicine and homeopathy [ 4]. AM explicitly sees itself as an extension and supplement to the\"conventional medicine\" and not as an alternative medicine[5] .As p e c i a lf e a t u r eo fA Mc o m p a r e dt oo t h e ri n t e g r a t i v e medical disciplines is that AM is established both in the outpatientsectorandinmanyacutehospitals[ 6]. Since 2002 German hospital payment is based on the German refined diagnosis-related groups (G-DRGs) [ 7]. DRGsaredefinedbythepatients'diagnoses,genderandage, treatment procedures, complications or comorbidities, and further attributes. Based on this data, a predetermined ratepercaseiscalculated. The German official classification of operational proce- dures (Operationen und Prozedurenschl \u00a8ussel:O P S )i su s e d to code operations and other medical procedures. Within the OPS, anthroposophic medical complex treatment was e s t a b l i s h e di n2 0 0 5a sas p e c i a lc o d e( O P S8 - 9 7 5 . 3 ; Table 1) [8,9]. This is owed to the fact that AM requires an intense use of resources (counseling, diagnosis, and treatment plan-ning), therapeutic intervention (physical therapy, rhythmical mas- sage), and nursing interventions (external applications suchas wound and liniments). Once a patient receives at least30 therapeutic units within his inpatient treatment codedwith this digit, an additional unweighted payment \"ZE-26\" (anthroposophic complex medical treatment additionalpayment) is generated [ 9,10]. This additional payment has tobenegotiatedandagreedonbyeachhospitalindividuallywith insurance companies as a part of the remunerationnegotiationsaccordingtothehospitalremunerationact[ 11]. Thecompensationcurrentlyvariesfromhospitaltohospital. The present study examined whether the provision of AMCisassociatedwithanincreaseduseofresources. 2. Material and Methods 2.1.DataSelection. ThecurrentanalysisisbasedonGerman cost and performance data from 2009 which had alreadybeen approved and sent to the Institute for the HospitalRemunerationSystem(InEK).FromthesevenAMhospitalsor departments which calculate the ZE-26 in Germany,three hospitals, namely, the Community hospital Havelh \u00a8ohe (Berlin),theCommunityhospitalHerdecke,andthehospital \u00a8Oschelbronn,takepartintheannualcostcalculationofInEK. Thus, valid cost data are only available from these threeinstitutions( Figure1).Thesedataweregroupedintothe2011 version of the G-DRG system and valued at the federal baserate2011. Weighted additional payment was considered in com- pliance with the price of the Case Fees Agreement (Ger-man:FallpauschalenvereinbarungFPV)of2011.Unweightedadditional payments were, if possible, taken into account using the individual hospital prices from 2009. In the rare casesinwhichnoindividualhospitalarrangementwasmade,treatments were considered with 600C .

The \"key service\"is defined as the sum of the cost values in the accountgroups 04 (operating room), 05 (anesthesia), 06 (delivery room),07(cardiacdiagnosis/treatment),and08(endoscopic diagnostics/therapy) plus the cost values of the cost elementgroup 05 (implants) which have not yet been included. Theremaining costs of the InEK cost matrix are referred to as\"differentialcosts.\" Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 18.0 for Windows. Descriptive analysis was used to determine ratesand proportions. Means and standard deviations (SDs) werecalculated for continuous data. Two-tailed Chi-square testwas used to analyze differences in frequencies; -test was used to analyze differences in means. A value of less than0.05wasregardedasindicatingastatisticallysignificantdifference. 2.3. Ethical Considerations. The present study is based on secondary data collected from the hospitals and for thereference group provided by the InEK. As such, the rec-ommendations for good practice in secondary data analysis (e.g.,anonymizationofdataonprescriptionsanddiagnoses) developed among others by the German Working Group ontheCollectionandUseofSecondaryDatawereappliedinfull[12]. 3.

Thisisduetothefactthatnearlyhalfofthecases(46.6%) withAMCwerehighoutlierswhileinliersamountedto53.1%.Therefore low the cases without AMC, cost data of the cases with AMC was strikingly different. Cases with AMC produced average costs of 7,992C ;i n l i e r so n l yp r o d u c e d adjusted costs of 6,638C which was still 1,394C higher than intheInEKreferencegroup(5,244C ).

Discussion Much work has been spent to evaluate the outcome ofintegrativein-patienttreatment[ 13,14],butonlysomearticles deal with the costs of such strategies [ 15,16]. This article for the first time evaluates the costs for integrative in-patienttreatment in three hospitals using cost and remunerationdata,whichincontrasttootherapproachestakestheperspec-tive of the healthcare suppliers. This study in particular ana-lyzes cases with anthroposophic medical complex treatment(AMC).Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 5 Asafirstresult,wefoundawidedispersionoftheG-DRG spectrum for the provision of AMC. This may be explainedb yt h ef a c tt h a tt h eu s eo fA Mi sp a t i e n t - s p e c i fi ca n d ,i nadditiontotheclinicalpicture,determinedbythepersonalityof the patient and the patient's will [ 17]. Thus it is primarily not the type of illness or the DRG group which triggers the provisionoftheanthroposophicadditionalpayment,butthe individualtherapeuticprocessnegotiatedbetweenphysicianandpatient. Our evaluation also revealed significant cost differences among the hospitals in the provision of AMC. Apart frompatient physician interactions, this is owed to the hospital-specific processes and medical collectives treated. This in-h o u s et r e a t m e n ts t r u c t u r ew a sn o tap a r to ft h i se v a l u a t i o nbut however should be analyzed in a subsequent study,in which, for example, by means of a clustering basedon performance groups, the costs and treatments' side ofcomparable entities of the anthroposophic hospitals to becalculatedarecompared[ 18].Atthispresenttime,itthuscan be inferred that AMC should not be subject to a nationallystandardized additional payment and should be determinedandnegotiatedfromhospitaltohospital. This hospital-specific procedure for the additional pay- ment of the ZE-26 is not unique in the G-DRG system.According to the catalog for additional payments, there isa total of 64 payments listed which are to be negotiatedindividuallywitheachhospital[ 10].Themajorityoftheseare attributable to drugs, operational and medical interventions(e.g.,ZE2011-53 graft prosthesis for aortic aneurysms with fenestration or branch\") which, due to their complexity or limited use, are not subject to the federal calculation. Still to be found in this catalog nextto the anthroposophic complex medical treatment are threesimilar additional payments declared as \"special treatments\"by the InEK Institute, which, due to their characteristics,might be accompanied by a desired longer length of stay:the ZE2011-36 \"care for the severely disabled,\" the ZE2011- 40\"additional payment alternative complex treatment,\" and thenationallyweightedZE60\"palliativecomplextreatment\".Whilsttheliteratureresearchdidnotshowanyfurtherusefulinformation for the first two payments, it turns out that theadditional payment for palliative care is affected by similarremunerationproblemswhicharecurrentlydiscussedintheliterature [ 19] and lead to a calculated additional payment compensatingforthedesiredprolongedlengthofstay[ 20]. Another study of Romeyke and Stummer [ 21]a n a l y z e d complexrheumatictreatmentandsimilartoourstudyfounda prolonged stay of patients without higher costs per dayassociated with this form of treatment. However that studyused data from the beginning of the DRG calculation andreliability data was weak. Because of the limited range ofDRGs affected, a specific DRG (I97Z) for the complexr h e u m a t i ct r e a t m e n tc o u l db ee s t a b l i s h e da n dc a l c u l a t e dmeanwhile. Our study showed that the provision of AMC is associatedwithaprolongedlengthofstay,andthisisnotjust since there is a compensation by the additional fee \"ZE-26.\"Thus, it is not the doctor or therapist input per day whichleads to the financial shortfallcompared to the InEK patientpopulation with regard to the G-DRG remuneration, butrather the extended hospital stay which is not compensated byahighoutliersurchargewhichonlypartiallycompensatesforanincreaseduseofresourcesaftertheuppertrimpointofthe DRG has been exceeded [ 22]. For inlier collectives with systematically longer stays that do not reach the upper trimpoint,nocompensationexistsatall. Consequently all inpatients with a longer stay than the DRG-average tend to be remunerated with a deficit and notonly the affected cases in anthroposophic hospitals. Whati sr e l e v a n t ,h o w e v e r ,i st h a ti tc a nb eb a l a n c e do u t ,f r o man economic aspect, by cases with a short stay. After 55.7%of all cases and 50.7% of all inliers without AMC could bedischarged before reaching the mean residence time of eachDRG, there is no underfunding due to the length of stay forthis case collectives. If, however, a longer residence is notdue to inefficiency but to a medical specialty or complextreatment, such as the anthroposophic complex medicaltreatment,thenasanctioningoftheeconomicdisadvantagesby a \"right shift\" of the lengths of stay (for long inliers andhighoutliers)isnotappropriate. 5. Limitations Although this study has used validated data, it still has limi-tations. Firstly 2,100 hospitals do exist in Germany, but only113 of them take part in the annual cost calculation of InEKof which three are anthroposophic hospitals. This of coursedenotesanoverproportionalparticipationofanthroposophichospitalsintheannualcalculationofInEK.Butalthoughtheparticipationrateofanthroposophichospitalsissignificantlyhigher than those of conventional hospitals, the large databasis of 4.5 million patients in total suggests that the biascausedbyanthroposophichospitalsismarginal. Secondly no information about the most relevant diag- nostic groups (represented by the MDC class in the DRGclassification) is given. This is due to the fact that the caseswith AMC distribute over a total of 308 G-DRGs and thusourdatadidnotallowavalidclusteringondiagnosticgroups. As a consequence, we were not able to compare cases with or without AMC in more detail at the level of DRGs. Thisunfortunately leads to the problem of a certain amountof impreciseness while mapping difference costs and cases.However,thisdoesnotafflictthegeneralresultsofthiswork. Finally from a methodological point of view, cost data are notoriously skewed, which in our data is suggested bythe high standard deviations relative to the means. Thus,otherstatisticalapproacheslikebootstrappingmightbemoreappropriate for this situation [ 23]. However, the structure of the raw data given for this analysis did not allow for morecomplexstatisticaltests. 6. Implications for Health Policy Anthroposophic medicine in Germany is legally recognizedas a special type of integrative treatment which is highlydemandedonthepatients'side.Wewereabletodemonstratethatanthroposophicmedicineatthemomentcanonlyestab-lishitselfintheacutein-patientsectorwhencompensationof6 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine theincreaseduseofresourcescalculatedindividuallybyeach hospitaliseffectedovertheZE-26. Currently the compensation rates, at least among the three participating hospitals, do not cover the costs andare thus associated with a negative contribution margin persupplied AMC. Therefore the hospitals do not have any economical incentive to provide this type of medicine for economicreasons[ 24]. Whetheranthroposophicmedicinewithitsspecialusein therapy can establish itself under these conditions in an in-patient setting either midterm or long term, will mainly bea political or social decision which, in the end, should besupported by arguments as have been described and carriedoutinthispaper.

Introduction Integrative medicine according to the definition of the con- sortium of the Academic Health Centers for integrativemedicine is \"the practice of medicine that reaffirms theimportance of the relationship between practitioner andpatient,focusesonthewholeperson,isinformedbyevidence,and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic approaches,healthcare professionals, and disciplines to achieve opti-m a lh e a l t ha n dh e a l i n g \"[ 1]. It therefore may combine the treatment of conventional medicine and complementaryalternative medicine (CAM) and assists the patient's own capacitiestorecoverfromillness. In the last decades, several hospitals have adopted this concept of integrative medicine for the treatment of chronicandacutestatesofillnessesinin-patienttreatment[ 2,3].Thisincludes hospitals with a special focus on mind body thera- pies, naturopathy, anthroposophical medicine, homeopathyor traditional Chinese medicine. From those institutions, a varietyofhigh-qualityclinicalstudiesinspecialtherapieslike acupuncture [ 4], leeches therapy [ 5], fasting [ 6], or cupping [7] have been performed and published which demonstrate the power of single components of integrative in-patienttreatment. Moreover large studies have also investigatedsafety aspects of theseapproaches [ 8]. To provide additional evidence for the whole system in real world treatment,concept evaluations of the approach of integrative medicineforin-andout-patienttreatmenthavebeenproposed[ 9]. Already in the very early years of these institutions such whole systems evaluations, that is, with the focus on com-parative health economic analysis, demonstrated the ther-apeutic potential of these approaches [ 10]. Nowadays such2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine evaluations have regained the interest of stakeholders of the healthcaresystemsuchashealthinsurancesorgovernmentalauthorities mainly to develop special diseases managementpathways or to create specific diagnose related groups andadditional payments [ 11,12]. In particular scientific interest was focused on the sustainability of integrative treatment outcomesafterin-patienttreatment.Studiesinthisfieldsofar haveshownhighpatientsatisfaction,andreducedout-patientexpensesanddoctor'svisits[ 13]. Intheappraisalofpatient'sbenefitsseveralmeasureslike patient' mood, depression, or pain perception were appliedtodemonstratetheeffectsofintegrativein-patienttreatment.However health related quality of life very early became themain and most important outcome parameter and denotestheleastcommondenominatorofsuchevaluations[ 14]. Up to now, published data is widespread and no system- atic review so far has collected the results of the studies toget a broader picture of the effects of integrative in-patienttreatment. The aim of this paper was to summarize thecurrentevidenceforapossibleeffectivenessofintegrativein-patient treatment on patients' quality of life by means of ameta-analysis. 2. Material and Methods 2.1. Search Strategy. The following databases were used to findarticles:MEDLINE,EMBASE,AMED,PsycInfo,PsycLitCCMED, and CAMbase [ 15]. We also screened the journal databasesofrelevantpublishers,thatis,gms,Karger,Kluwer,Krause and Pachernegg, Springer, Thieme, and Wiley-Inter-science,tofindrelevantinformation.Finally,wesearchedthearchiveofthespecialistlibraryforCAMofWitten/HerdeckeUniversity for gray literature not listed in the above men-tioned databases. The search terms were (naturopathy OR \"integrative medicine\" OR anthroposophical OR homeo- pathic)AND(clinicORhospital). 2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Articles were included if patients were treated in a hospital (no out-patient orday clinic treatment). To guarantee comparability SF-36 wasthe predefined outcome measure for patients' quality oflife. To get a picture the sustainability of the effects, wedecidedtoconcentrateonthedifferencesbetween\"baseline\"and \"followup\" with a follow-up duration of three months.Finally the aspect of \"real world data\" was covered and thuscontrolled clinical trials of a single drug or treatment wereexcluded. All articles were fully read and their reference lists were checkedforfurtherrelevantpublications.Toguaranteevalid-ity of the selection process, all abstracts of excluded paperswere double checked. The complete search was performed between March and May 2012. The reporting of the results adheredtotheMOOSEandQUOROMguidelines[ 16]. 2.3.DataExtraction. Detailsofeligiblestudieswereextract- ed and summarized using a data extraction sheet includingthe study indicators year, origin, institution, therapeuticapproach, diseases, treatment duration, number of patients,and mental and physical scores of the SF-36 (mean and standarddeviationsatbaselineandfollowup).Extracteddatawascross-checkedagain. 2.4.StatisticalAnalysis.

Results A total of 364 records were found, of which 36 could beidentified as reviews. After screening the abstracts of theremaining 328 records, 268 records were excluded becausethey did not fit to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Theremaining 60 articles were assessed for eligibility and other52wereexcludedaccordingtotheinclusion/exclusioncriteriaafter reading the full text as they provided data on out-patient treatment or did not report on SF-36 quality of lifedata. Thus eight articles published between 2003 and 2010were included in the final meta-analysis. A flow chart of theinclusionprocessisprovidedin Figure1.

Therefore, this meta-analysis only digs a small corridor in the field of evidence.

Fibromyalgiaposesachallengefortherapy.Recentguidelinessuggestthatbromyalgiashouldbetreatedwithinamultidisciplinary therapyapproach.NodataareavailablethatevaluatedmultimodaltreatmentstrategiesofIntegrativeMedicine(IM).Weconducted a controlled, nonrandomized pilot study that compared two inpatient treatment strategies, an IM approach that included fasting therapy and a conventional rheumatology (CM) approach. IM used fasting cure and Mind-Body-Medicine as specic methods. Of48 included consecutive patients, 28 were treated with IM, 20 with CM. Primary outcome was change in the Fibromyalgia ImpactQuestionnaire (FIQ) score aer the 2-week hospital stay. Secondary outcomes included scores of pain, depression, anxiety, andwell being. Assessments were repeated aer 12 weeks. At 2 weeks, there were signicant improvements in the FIQ ( ) and for most of secondary outcomes for the IM group compared to the CM group. e benecial eects for the IM approach werereduced aer 12 weeks and no longer statistically signicant with the exception of anxiety. Findings indicate that a multimodal IMtreatment with fasting therapy might be superior to CM in the short term and not inferior in the mid term. Longer-term studiesare warranted to assess the clinical impact of integrative multimodal treatment in bromyalgia. 1.Introduction Fibromyalgia is a complex clinical pain syndrome. Patients typically suer from widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, insomnia, and impairment of physical and psycho-logical quality of life [1, 2]. e international prevalence of bromyalgia ranges from 0.7 to 3.3% in the general adult population with an increase in recent years and a continuousmajority of female patients [2-4]. e etiology of bromyalgia is still unclear, although research showed an abnormal pain processing and loweredmechanical and thermal pain threshold by fMRI [5] as wellas dysfunction of descending pain modulatory systems, for example, in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex [ 6] uid[7]. Further discovered dysfunctions of the neuroendocrine axis could explain concomitant complaints as fatigue, irri- table bowel, and mood disorders that are predominant in most of the bromyalgia patients [8]. An association with psychosocial stressors is most likely [ 1,8,9]. Recent guidelines recommend a multimodal, multidisci- plinary therapeutic approach involving medication, exercise, patienteducation,andbehavioralandpsychosomatictherapy [4,10]. Due to frequent unsatisfying results of conven- tional treatment a substantial proportion of patients usecomplementary and integrative approaches such as Mind- body medicine, supplements, acupuncture, massage, and various nutritional therapies [11 ]. Clinical experience and preliminary evidence from uncontrolled prospective studiessuggest that an integrative approach including nutritional2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine and fasting therapies may help to decrease symptoms and increase the quality-of-life in inpatients with bromyalgia [12,13]. However, it would be useful to know how such an Integrative Medicine approach compares with conventionalmultimodal treatment which is established in specialized hospital units of rheumatology or pain medicine. Prolongedmodiedfasting(Fastingcure,fastingtherapy) with dened periods of voluntary abstention from solid food and a daily total energy intake <500kcal has been found eective in several randomized trials on rheumatoid arthritis [ 14,15]. e anti-inammatory, pain relieving, antinociceptive, and mood-enhancing eects of fasting and caloric restriction have been well described in experimental and clinical studies [ 16-19]. Both, patients with rheumatoid arthritis and bromyalgia frequently report that elimination diets and meal skipping alleviate their symptoms [13, 20, 21]. In a controlled nonrandomized study on the inuence of a mediterranean diet or a fasting cure on the intestinal microorathesubgroupofpatientswithbromyalgiaexperi-encedagreaterimprovementthannonfasters[ 13].Inanother trial with a heterogeneous sample of chronic pain patients fasting led to an amelioration of mood and well-being [ 22]. In Germany, several academic hospital departments for naturopathic and integrative medicine have accumulated clinical experience in inpatient treatments of bromyalgia.Within the treatment concepts of the integrative approach, modied fasting therapy is a mainstay of therapy. Notably, fasting treatments have been found to enhance health-promoting lifestyle modication [12 ], thus supporting a further key element of integrative therapy in bromyalgia, mind-body medicine. We conducted this rst controlled nonrandomized pilot- study to compare an integrative treatment strategy including fasting cure with a conventional rheumatologic treatment strategy. Weinvestigatedqualityoflife,painintensity,andpsycho- logical outcomes before and aer the treatment of bromyal- gia in inpatients of two dierent departments of Internal Medicine, Integrative Medicine, and Rheumatology, of the same hospital, which is a tertiary center for Rheumatologic diseases. We hypothesized that fasting and integrative treat-ment would lead to a benecial add-on eect with regards to quality-of-life, pain, and further psychological outcomes at time of hospital dismissal. 2.MaterialandMethods 2.1.StudyDesignandParticipants. e study was conducted as a prospective, controlled nonrandomized study. e study protocolwasreviewedandapprovedbytheEthicsCommittee of the Charit\u00e9-University Medical Center, Berlin, and allpatients gave their informed consent to study participation. Collectionofdatawasperformedbytrainedstudypersonnel. All study subjects were inpatients from two departments of the Immanuel Hospital Berlin which is specialized in the treatment of rheumatic and chronic pain diseases, (1)patients of the Department of Integrative and Complemen- tary Medicine and, (2) patients of the Department of InternalMedicine and Rheumatology. e primary diagnosis andreason for hospital admission of all participants was primary bromyalgia. e study sample consisted of consecutivelyadmitted inpatients during a 9-month period, who regularly stayed14\u00b12days in hospital for multidisciplinary treatment. Inclusion criteria were a manifest bromyalgia, as diag- nosed by a rheumatologist, pain specialist, or internist, an age between 18 and 70 years, and a BMI between 20 and 45kg/m 2. Patients with a start or change in drug therapy of their FMS less than 6 weeks ago, clinical relevant pro- gressive or malignant diseases, current addiction or preg- nancy, and inadequate cognitive abilities of cooperation were not included in the study. Further exclusion criteria were eating disorders, manifest liver disease, renal failure, gastric ulcer, and severe comorbidity including cancer and AIDS, premedication with immunosuppressive drugs (except cor- ticosteroids) or coumarins, seri-ous chronic infections, psychosis, epilepsy, type-1 diabetes,pregnancy, lactation, and a weight loss during the previous 3 months of>3kg. 2.2.Interventions 2.2.1. Conventional Treatment. e conventional rheumato- logic treatment approach consisted of a complex multidis- ciplinary treatment schedule with the following elements: group physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, thermal therapy, psy- chosomatic therapy, aerobic exercise, pool exercise, cogni- tive behavioral therapy, and education. e integrative and ComplementaryMedicineapproachusedthesametreatmentelements.Inaddition,fastingtherapyandnutritionaltherapy supported by a group-based Mind-Body-Medicine concept was applied. e patients of both departments received asimilar global amount of treatments with a total of 1600 to2200 treatment minutes within the 2-week hospital period, according to agreements with health insurance companies in Germany. e method of fasting was adapted from the technique described by Buchinger [23- 26]. A fasting period with 7 to 8 days of subtotal caloric restriction (daily nutritional energyintake<500kcal) was predened. Fasting was preceded by one or two prefasting days, using a 800kcal/day monodietof fruit, rice, or potatoes according to patients' choice. Fasting then began the following day with ingestion of an oral laxative, Natrium sulfuricum (\"Glauber's salt\", 20-40g). During fasting an enema or, if not wished by the patient, a mild laxative was applied every other day. e patients wererecommendedtodrink2-3ofuidseachday(mineralwater, small quantities of juice, and herbal teas). Vegetablebroth was taken at lunch. e daily energy intake during the fast amounted to 350kcal/day. For breaking the fast an apple was slowly eaten. e breakfast was followed by stepwise reintroduction of food with achievement of normocaloric in tak eb yv eg gda y nthe postfasting days a focus is set on reintroducing mindfulness to eating. Both departments are well experienced with the treat- ment of bromyalgia syndrome and patients are received in a general appreciating manner. Inpatient treatments forEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 bromyalgia syndrome are recommended by German S-3 guidelines[1 ]andbyhealthinsurancecompaniesforpatients which do not respond adequately to outpatient care, includ- ing multimodal outpatient treatment. Patients are referredto both departments by internists, family practitioners, and rheumatologists comparably with patients' preference for Integrative Medicine and fasting treatment being the main criteria for choice of hospital department. 2.3. Measurements. All measures were assessed by trained study nurses at three study visits, at baseline, aer 2 weeks (at dismissal from hospital) and at study week 12 (10 weeks aer dismissal). e primary outcome measure was the change in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) score frombaseline to the end of the in-hospital intervention. e FIQ isa validated, multidimensional measure to assess the severity of bromyalgia as rated by patients. e total score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms [ 27].evalidatedGermanversionwasused[28 ]. Globalpainstatuswasassessed additionallybyaskingthe patients for the global severity of the disease-related pain by means of a self-rating 100mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)withavalueof100indicatingmaximumpainand0indicating no pain. Patients were carefully instructed before rst self- ratings on the correct use of the VAS. Prespecied other secondary outcomes included (1) a 100mm visual analogue scale for self-rated global quality of sleep; (2) the German version of the Spielberger State- Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which consists of 20 items relating to state anxiety and 20 items relating to trait anxiety[29]; (3) the Bf-S Zerssen well-being scale, which measures momentaryemotionalwell-beingandconsistofthreeanswer categories with higher scores indicating lower well-being [30]; (4) the German version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [31], a validated standard measure for anxiety and depression which uses a 14-item scale with seven of the items related to anxiety and seven related to depression [32 ]; (5) the German version of the Pain Percep- tion Scale for Adolescents (SES), which assesses sensory pain perception in chronic pain patients [33 ]. Subjectsheightandbodyweightweremeasuredfollowing a standardized protocol while patients wore light clothing and no shoes aer an overnight fast. BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height 2(m). Anthropometrical and clinical data were collected by trained study personnel. Seated blood pressure was measured aer 5min rest with a calibrated sphygmomanometer at the nondominant arm by trainednurses. 2.4. Statistical Analysis. As the study was designed as a nonrandomized pilot study no sample size calculation was conducted. However, we intended to include 60 patients andassumed a drop-out rate of 15 %, giving a study sample of about 50 patients with full data sets. Baseline dierences were calculated by Kruskal-Wallis test. All outcome criteria were analyzed by intention-to- treat; including all subjects, irrespective whether or not they adhered to the protocol or gave a full set of data. For eachoutcome we tted a generalized estimation equation (GEE),analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) which included treat- ment group (binary covariate), and the respective baseline value (linear covariable) as independent variables. Treatmenteects were estimated within these models, and reported as adjusted group dierences including their respective 95 % condence intervals (CI) and values. All reported values were based on two-sided tests, and a -value<0.05 was considered signicant. All statistical computations were performed with SAS/STAT statistical soware version 9.1 (SAS institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). 3.Results 3.1.Baseline. During the 9-month study recruitment period we screened 56 screened patients with manifest bromyalgia which were admitted to one of the two hospital departments. Of these, 48 volunteered to participate in our study; 20 in the department of Rheumatology and 28 in the department of Integrative and Complementary Medicine. Data assessmentswere complete for study visits 1 (baseline) and 2 (week 2).Aer 12 weeks data from 25 patients of the department of Integrative and Complementary Medicine and 17 of the department of Rheumatology were available. Baseline characteristics of the study population revealed a middle-aged and predominantly female study population. Patients of the Department of Rheumatology showed a signicantly greater impaired quality of life, the primaryoutcome, and had slightly higher pain scores and weremore emotionally distressed with slightly higher scores for depression and anxiety compared to patients of the Depart- ment for Integrative and Complementary Medicine ( Table 1). Use of medication prior and during the hospital stay, for example, with amitriptyline and other antidepressants, was not dierent between groups. 3.2.PrimaryOutcome. eFIQscoredecreasedsubstantially in the Integrative Medicine Group and to a signicantly greater extent compared to the Rheumatologic group aer 2 weeks ( Table 2 ). At 12 weeks, the FIQ score increased again in both groups resulting in improvements of only 12% for the integrative and fasting approach and 6% for the control group, resulting in a nonsignicant dierence between the groups. 3.3. Secondary Outcomes. At 2 weeks, the Integrative Medicine group had greater mean improvements in all secondary outcomes and most pronounced in the scores ofquality of sleep, pain, pain perception, and anxiety (HADS, STAI) (Table 2 ). At 12 weeks, the pain score and pain perception score only showed a trend towards a benecial outcome for the Integrative Medicine group compared to the Rheumatology group. All psychological outcomes were better in the Integra- tive Medicine group compared to the Rheumatologic group, however group dierences were reduced and no longerstatistically signicant with the exception of anxiety. All of the outcomes deteriorated again compared to the 2-weeks4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine T1:Baseline characteristics. 21 (75.0%) 13 (65.0%) 0.452 Practice of Relaxation, No. /( %) (28.5%) 5 (25.0%) 0.784 systolic blood pressure; DBP: diastolic blood pressure.

Safety. ere were no serious adverse events in both groups. About 35 %in each group reported some minor side eect. Within the Integrative Medicine group the rst fast- ing days were frequently accompanied by dizziness, minorheadache,andtiredness.PatientsintheRheumatology groupreported frequently about muscle pain and tiredness, most likely due to exercise and physical therapies. 24 out of 28 patients in the integrative Medicine group declared that they would participate in fasting as again. 17 out of 20 patients in the Rheumatology group declared that they would like to repeat the treatment. 4.Discussion In this controlled nonrandomized trial we compared the eectiveness of two time- and attention-balanced inpatient multimodal treatment strategies: an Integrative Medicine approach that included fasting therapy versus the con-ventional Rheumatologic therapy. While patients in the Rheumatologic group were more diseased at baseline, a d j u s t e dd a t aa n a l y s i ss h o w e dam o r eb e n e c i a le e c to ft h e Integrative Medicine approach aer 2 weeks for all of the clinical outcomes. At week 12, eects in both groups were reduced but still favored the Integrative Medicine approach, for example, for the psychological outcomes. e minimallyclinically important dierence of the FIQ is estimated toamount to 14%.I nt h ep r e s e n ts t u d yt h er e d u c t i o no ft h e FIQ at 2 and 12 weeks was 30.2 %and 12.2%with Integrative Medicine versus 13.1% and 6.0%with multimodal Rheuma- tologic care. us, our results point to a relevant immediate eect of the Integrative Medicine approach while the long- term eects appear to be only mild.We were surprised to see an only mild eectiveness of the Rheumatologic multimodal treatment approach although it combined several evidence-based treatment methods such as aerobic exercise, pool exercise, thermal therapy, psychother- apy, and cognitive behavioral therapy. However, it has tobe noted that patients that are admitted to an inpatient treatment in Germany are highly selected as they have to be documented nonresponders to outpatient treatments according to requirements of health insurance companies and thus may be especially dicult to treat. A recent study has evaluated the eects of a conventional multimodal inpatient treatment of 3 weeks within the settingof a specialized Rheumatologic rehabilitation hospital [ 34]. For the outcomes that were used (Pain, HADS) the results of the Integrative Medicine approach used in this study were also favorable, thus conrming our results. Principally, treatment of bromyalgia is still unsatisfying and most patients continue to be in considerable pain yearsaer the rst diagnosis and experience reduced quality oflife. New approaches are needed and the majority of patientswith bromyalgia frequently also use methods of comple- mentary medicine. Various types of exercise and mind-body medicine have been advocated, yet long-term adherence is limited. In Germany, nutritional therapies and fasting are very popular. Fasting treatments have found to be eective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and pain syndromes, furthermore they may support motivation and self-ecacyin health-promoting lifestyle modication [12 ,15,21,35]. In a preliminary study we observed a moderate pain-relievingeect of fasting in bromyalgia [13]. Of note, we found a partially persisting mood-enhancing eect in the integrative medicine group which may be related to fasting therapy. Previous research has documented mood-enhancing eects of caloric restriction and fasting. Several mechanisms including increased central serotonin availability have been described experimentally [17 ].Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5T2:Outcomes in both groups at baseline, week 2 and 12 with group dierences as indicators of change.

A small uncontrolled studyin 28 patients found an Ayurvedic program, also focusingon nutrition and mind-boy techniques, to be eective with al a s t i n ge e c tu pt o2 4m o n t h s[ 36]. However, andunspecic eects were mostlikely factors tothe eect. In view of our documented eects and safety of the Integrative Medicine approach further research on the eec- tiveness of complex multimodal Integrative treatments and comparisons with standard care in bromyalgia is warranted. Suchastudyshouldhavealargersamplesize,allocatepatientsrandomly, and include an attention control for the fastingintervention. Here the conventional group could be deprived of some specic food ingredient without inducing fasting metabolism. As it is dicult to randomize patients into complete treatment settings due to patient preferences and obligations of cost coverage, also outcome research might be useful in benchmarking the best strategy in intensied treatment strategies of bromyalgia. Some limitations relate to our study. First, we used a nonrandomized study design as it is currently not possible to randomize patients to hospital departments when costs are covered by health insurance companies under usual care.Nonrandomized studies may introduce a bias by patientselection and dierent prognostic and response factors between the groups. In fact, baseline values found patients of theRheumatologicdepartmenttobemorediseasedandmoredistressed. However, most of the baseline dierences were statistically nonsignicant and all our data analysis included baseline values as covariates. Of note, Physicians can refer patients to both hospital departments only if they are doc- umented nonresponders to intensive outpatient outpatient treatment. e selection of the department (Rheumatology or Integrative Medicine is mainly inuenced by patientspreference. Here a specic selection bias may be introducedas patients interested in integrative Medicine are possibly more likely to search for comprehensive treatments in less severe disease states. Second, our study population was of limited size. Smaller study populations hold the risk of overestimation of eects on the one side and nondetection of moderate treatment eects on the other side. However, if signicant eects are found the magnitude of eects andthe related possible clinical relevance of the intervention isemphasized,whichourresultsreect.Athirdlimitationisthe short observation period of 3 months. Further studies should includeobservationperiodsof12monthsandlongertoassess long-term symptom control. A strength of our study relates to the fact, that both departmentsaresituatedinthesamehospitalandthat,beside fasting and mind-body medicine, all other treatments werecomparable and applied by the same personnel. us setting eects, attention eects and other nonspecic factors that may otherwise introduce bias in comparative studies wereminimized. In conclusion, our preliminary ndings indicate that a multimodal Integrative Medicine treatment approach thatincludedfastingtherapymightbesuperiortothemultimodal conventional Rheumatologic approach in the short-term in patients with severe bromyalgia. At 12 weeks neither of thestudied interventions was signicantly superior or achievedclinically relevant improvement. Longer-term studies are warranted to assess the clinical impact and potential of multimodal Integrative Medicine in bromyalgia. onctofnterests e authors do not have any conict of interests with thecontent of the paper.

In China, Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is widely used as an adjunct to biomedicine (BM) in treating myocardial infarction (MI). is meta-analysis of RCTs evaluated the ecacy of combined CHM-BM in the treatment of MI, compared to BM alone.ixty-ve RCTs (12,022 patients) of moderate quality were given CHM plus BM, and 5,986 patientsused BM only. Combined results showed clear additional eect of CHM-BM treatment in reducing all-cause mortality 95% CI 2= 0.0%) and mortality of cardiac origin (RRR = %, 95% CI = 22%-52%, 2=22.8).Benetsremainedaerrandom-eecttrimandlladjustmentforpublicationbias(adjustedRRRforall-causemortality = 29%, 95%CI = 16%-40%; adjusted RRR death = 32 %, 95%CI = 15%-46%). CHM is also found to be ecacious in lowering the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial reinfarction, heart failure, angina, and occurrence of total heart events. In conclusion, addition of CHM is very likely to be able to improve survival of MI patients who are already receiving BM. Further conrmatory evaluation via large blinded randomied trials is warranted. 1.Background 1.1. Myocardial Infarction: Disease Burden and erapeutic Options. Incoronaryarterydisease,acriticalreductionofthe blood supply to the heart may result in myocardial infarction (MI), a phenomenon owing to the formation of an area of necrosis in heart muscles caused by inadequate supply of blood to the muscles, usually as a result of occlusion of a coronary artery. About a quarter of MI patients will die from it due to complications including cardiogenic shock, cardiacperforation,embolism,heartfailure,papillarymusclerapture, rhythm disturbances, or autoimmune pericarditis.Current evidence on biomedicine (BM) treatment suggests that aspirin, thrombolytics with or without adding low- molecular-weight heparin, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and nitrates are benecial for improving outcomes in peoplewith MI. Invasive procedures including arterybypass transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA, balloon were also found to be useful. However, their ecacy in preventingdeath is not without limitations. For instance, beta-blockers havenoshort-termeectonmortality,andtheymayincrease the risk of cardiogenic shock. rombolytics may causestroke and major bleeding while reducing mortality, and those who are treated will receive no additional benets from nitrates [1]. Despite these therapeutic advances, coronary artery disease remained to be the foremost leading cause of death in both low- and middle income countries as well as high-income countries, contributed 11.8% and 17.3% of total deaths, respectively [ 2]. Researchers are evaluating the potential benets and harms of add-on treatments like2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine vasodilators and positive inotropes on mortality [ 3]. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is another novel candidate as an add-on treatment. 1.2. Chinese Herbal Medicine for Treating Myocardial Infarc- tion.In China, CHM is widely prescribed in both outpatient and inpatient settings [4]. Amongst community health clin- ics, 75% provide both BM and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatments. TCM hospitals comprised 13.8% of all hospitals, and 90% of the BM hospitals are annexed with TCM departments [ 5]. Given the omnipresence of TCM services within the Chinese healthcare system, it is not uncommon for clinicians to prescribe CHM as an adjunctto BM treatment in the management of potentially life-threatening conditions including MI [6]. One of the most researched single herbs is Radix Astragali, which exerts its therapeuticeectivenessbyinhibitingcardiacbrosis,reduc- and arteriole den- sities [7 ]. Commonly used Chinese proprietary medicines include Shexiangbaoxin tablets and Tongxinluo capsules. Shexiangbaoxin tablets are found to slow MI pathogenesisby inhibiting hypertrophy related metabolites [8 ]. On the other hand, Tongxinluo capsules act by promoting local blood supply and thus limit infarct size [ 9]. CHM injections based on sheng mai san are also widely prescribed. It reduces infarct size via the activation of protein kinase C, opening of the mitochondrial KATP channels, and lowering the concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine, norepinephrine,methionine-enkephalin, and leucine-enkephalin [ 10,11]. 1.3. Synthesizing Chinese Herbal Medicine Trials: Focusing on Objective Outcomes. e average eect of these CHM formulae as an adjunct to BM could be estimated using random eect meta-analyses of randomized controlled tri- als (RCTs) [12]. One of the major caveats in conductingsystematic reviews on CHM is that existing RCTs are oen prone to high risks of bias, thus limiting their usefulness in elucidating treatment eectiveness [13]. However, results from a recent metaepidemiological study have provided an alternative perspective on this issue. It is suggested that objective outcomes are less susceptible to bias associated with inadequate allocation concealment and blinding [ 14, 15]. Accordingly, by focusing on objective outcomes likemortality, we may partially overcome limitations imposed by the relatively high risk of bias amongst CHM trials. 1.4.AimofisPaper. Taking into account the methodolog- ical considerations above, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs on the ecacy and safety of CHMfor MI as an add-on to BM treatment, with a focus on objec- tive critical outcomes including death, recurrent myocardial infarction, and other post-MI cardiac consequences. 2.Methods 2.1. Criteria for Considering Studies for is Paper. We included RCTs comparing the ecacy and safety of CHM plusBMversusBMalone.CHMisdenedasanypreparationcontainingatleastoneherboritsextractionreferencedinthe2010 Chinese [ 16]. We included RCTs which enrolledadultMIpatientsregardlessofgender,age,ethnicity, or comorbidities. We focused on the primary outcomes of (i)mortalityofcardiacoriginand(ii)all-causemorality.Wealso consider the following as secondary outcomes: (i) recurrence of MI and (ii) other nonfatal, post-MI cardiac outcomes including cardiac arrhythmia, heart failure, cardiac rupture, cardiogenic shock, and angina. Adverse events reported by authors were also summarized. We imposed no restrictions on language and publication status. 2.2.SearchMethodsforIdenticationofStudies. We searched 8 electronic databases since their inception to July 2010, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), Chinese Medical Current Contents (CMCC), and Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS) ( Figure 1). Search strategies are shown in Appendix 1 in the Supplementary Materials available onlineat http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/675906. 2.3.DataCollectionandAnalysis 2.3.1. Selection of Studies, Data Extraction, and Risk of Bias Assessment. Two reviewers (Y. Qin and C. Mao) inde- pendently screened the titles and abstracts to assess theireligibility. Full texts of potentially eligible citations wereretrieved for detailed examination. Selection discrepancieswere settled through discussions between these two authors. e remaining disagreements were resolved by consulting another author (J. L. Tang). For included RCTs, compre- hensive information on patients, CHM interventions, and baseline and control treatments, as well as outcomes, was extracted. Risks of bias amongst included RCTs were evalu- ated by the Cochrane collaboration's risk of bias assessmenttool [17]. e assessment composed of a description and a judgement for each entry in a risk of bias table, including (i) sequence generation, (ii) allocation sequence concealment, (iii) incomplete outcome data, (iv) selective outcome report- ing, and (v) other potential sources of bias. Blinding was assessed for the primary outcome of all-cause morality. 2.3.2. Data Analysis. Analyses were conducted using Stata 11 and R soware. Dichotomous ecacy outcomes were expressed as relative risk reduction (RRR) and relativerisk (RR), while RR was used for adverse events. 95 % condence intervals (CIs) were calculated for all estimates. We performed random-eect meta-analysis separately for each outcome. For primary outcomes of all-cause mortality and cardiac death, funnel plots were drawn for assessingpublication bias. In case of asymmetry, random trim and ll analysis were performed as a sensitivity analysis [ 18]. Tests for heterogeneity were performed with chi-squared testes, at a signicance level of . 2statistic was calculated to estimate variation across studies. We regarded 2< 25% as an indicator of low heterogeneity level, 25-50 %as moderate level, and higher than 50% as high level [ 19].

We expectedthat higher baseline risk and mean age could be associatedwith a smaller eect [1 ], while intravenous administration and longer treatment duration could be associated with a larger eect. 3.Results 3.1. Literature Search. As shown in Figure 1, our search in electronic bibliographical databases yielded 12,666 citations aer removal of duplications, of which 2,660 were classied as potentially relevant and were subjected to a full-textassessment. A total of 65 RCTs published in 63 articles met the inclusion criteria. Details of these studies are presented in Table 1. 3.2. Study Characteristics. A total of 6,036 patients were enrolled in the CHM plus BM group, and 5,986 patients wereallocated to the BM only group. e average size of the trials was 185 participants (ranging from 28 to 2735 participantsper trial). Fiy trials reported treatment duration and the average duration was 68.9 days, ranging from 3 to 1440 days. Forty-nine trials reported the length of followup. e average follow-up length was 7.1 months, ranging from 0.1 to 84 months. For diagnostic criteria, 36 (55.4%) studies applied the 1979 World Health Organization criteria, which enrolledpatientswith atleasttwo ofthefollowingthree presentations:chest pain or discomfort, an elevation in CK-MB levels, or an ECG with signicant ST-segment elevations [ 84]. Four adopted criteria from the Chinese Society of Cardiology [85] and one used criteria from the European Society of Cardiology [86 ]. Twelve applied author-dened diagnostic criteria, and the remaining 12 did not report criteria used.irty-one standardized Chinese herbal formulae were examined in 63 (96.9%) of the 65 included studies, whilethe other two studies used an individualized approach. 32 (50.0%) preparations were administrated orally, 30 (46.9% ) wereprescribedasherbalinjections,and2(3.12%)trialsused both intravenous and oral treatments. Eight formulae were evaluated by three or more trials. In total, these formulae wereassessedin38studies,constituting58.5% ofallincluded trials.

Among these 65 RCTs, only 7 were at low risk for bias for allocation sequence generation. Twelve were at high risk and the remaining RCTs did not report their sequence generation procedure clearly. All but one had highrisk of bias in terms of allocation concealment and none of the included studies report the use of blinding. However, we regarded the risks of bias associated with lack of blindingand allocation concealment to be minimal, as the primary outcomes were of objective nature. Two of the included studies had high risk of bias for incomplete data and one for selective outcome reporting. Six are at high risk of bias due to other reasons. In summary, we consider the overall riskof bias amongst our included studies to be moderate (Figure 2). e detailed risk of bias assessment results is presented in Appendix 2 in the supplementary materials. 3.4.EectsofInterventions 3.4.1. Impact on Fatal Outcomes. In this comparison ( Table 2), a total of 44 RCTs reported total all-cause mortality. Pooled results demonstrated superiority of combined treat- mentinpreventingall-causemortality(RRR=37%,95 %CI= 28%-45%). Funnel plot indicates the presence of publication bias. Aer applying trim and ll procedure ( Figure 3 ), the RRR remained to be signicant (RRR = 29 %, 95% CI = 16%-40%,Table 2 ). Ten RCTs reported death of cardiac origin, and pooled ndings also favor combined treatment (RRR = 39% , 95%CI = 22%-52%). Funnel plot indicates the presence of publication bias. Aer applying trim and ll procedure, the RRR remained to be signicant (RRR = 32 %, 95%CI = 15%-46%). Pooled results from another four RCTs reporting the occurrence of fatal cardiogenic shock also favored combinedtreatment (RRR = 28 %, 95% CI = 5%-45%). Respectively nine, six, ve, and three RCTs reported outcomes on suddencardiac death, fatal myocardial reinfarction, fatal heart fail- ure, and fatal cardiac arrhythmia. In these four comparisons, all pooled ndings favored combined treatment (sudden cardiac death: RRR = 24 %, 95%CI = 6%-45%; = 84%-222%), but of RCTs reporting this outcome, we were unable to explore heterogeneity using metaregression. 3.4.2. Impact on Nonfatal Cardiovascular Events. In this comparison ( Table 2), a total of 11 RCTs reported overall, undierentiatednonfatalheartevents.Pooledresultsdemon- strated superiority of combined treatment in preventing this outcome (RRR = 48%, 95 %CI = 40%-56%). Twenty-three RCTs evaluated reinfarction, the result combined treatment (RRR = 52%, 95 %CI = 39%-61%). e pooled results from 14 and 24 RCTs have also favored combined treatment, respectively, in preventingcardiogenic shock (RRR = 37% , 95%CI heterogeneity meta-analyses mentioned above.

In this comparison ( Table 2 ), nine RCTs reported bleeding as adverse events, but the pooled estimate was statisticallyinsignicant (RR = 0.97, 95 %CI = 0.73, 1.28). Two RCTs reported general, undierentiated adverse events, pooledestimate is heterogeneous and statistically insignicant (RR = 1.16, 95%CI = 0.59, 2.27, 44%). 4.Discussion is systematic review on the add-on eect of CHM on BM in the treatment of MI summarized ndings from 12,022 patientsreportedin65RCTs.eoverallriskofbiasamongst included studies was moderate. Despite the lack of allocationconcealment and blinding in the majority of included trials, i t si m p a c to nr i s ko fb i a sw a sl e s sc r i t i c a la sw ef o c u s e do n objective outcomes. Random-eect meta-analyses demon- strated that combined treatment is superior to BM alone in reducing the risk of all-cause mortality and death of cardiacorigin. Funnel plots indicated the presence of publication bias for both outcomes, and trim and ll procedures were conducted as sensitivity analyses. e directions of eectdid not change aer the adjustment, and the 95 %C Io ft h e estimates overlapped with the unadjusted values. e lower 95%CI boundary of the trim- and ll-adjusted RRR for all- cause and cardiac mortality was 16% and 15%, respectively. Conservativelyspeaking, CHM appeared tooer a protective eect against mortality aer adjusting for the publi- cation bias, a common problem amongst the clinical researchliterature on CHM [87 ].

Benets in preventing heart failure and angina werealso observed but these ndings are less robust given thesubjective nature of the outcome, and metaregression did not shed light on potential sources of heterogeneity. We have considered including allocation concealment and blinding as covariates in our metaregressions but numbers of trials with low risk in these domains are too small for conducting such analysis. e eect of combined treatment on these two outcomes would need to be further evaluated with method-ologically stronger trials. In addition, more comprehensive reporting on BM treatment details and adverse events is expected in future studies, preferably with reference to theCONSORT statement. Comprehensiveness of search is the major strength of this systematic review. e use of both international andChinesedatabasesallowedustolocateamuchhighernumberstudies compared to seven existing reviews on the topic [88]. We also attempted to synthesize results from trials evaluating heterogeneous CHM using random-eect model. is allowed us to estimate the average eect of adding CHM on top of conventional therapies [12 ]. e use of the trim and ll method has also partly circumvented the problem of publication bias. Nevertheless, the robustness ofour conclusion depends on the assumption that the objectivenature of outcomes was less aected by two major sources of bias: allocation concealment and blinding. While this assumption is tested in metaepidemiological studies [89 , 90], the generalizability of these ndings warrants further investigations. 5.Conclusion Based on RCTs of moderate quality, this systematic review demonstrated consistent, add-on benets of using CHM on top in BM treatment for preventing all-cause and cardiacmortalityamongstMIpatients.esendingsareinlinewiththe results from seven existing systematic reviews of smaller scope and lower methodological quality. is tentative con- clusion warrants further scrutiny using rigorously designed RCT, and a more comprehensive approach in reporting BM treatment details and adverse events is warranted.

Objective .T oe v a l u a t et h ee ectiveness of Tuina-focused integrative Chinese medical therapies (TICMT) on inpatients with low back pain (LBP). Methods . 6 English and Chinese databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TICMT for in-patients with LBP . The methodological quality of the included RCTs was assessed based on PEDro scale. And the meta-analyses of TICMT for LBP on pain and functional status were conducted. Results . 20 RCTs were included. The methodological quality of the included RCTs was poor. The meta-analyses' results showed that TICMT had statistically signicant e ects on pain and functional status, especially Tuina plus Chinese herbal medicine (standardised mean di erence, SMD: 1.17; 1.31; 95% CI 0.49 to 2.14 on functional and Tuina plus acupuncture (SMD: 0.94; 95% to 0.85 on functional status). But Tuina plus moxibustion or hot pack did not show signicant improvements on pain. And the long-term evidence of TICMT was far from su cient. Conclusions . The preliminary evidence from current studies suggests that TICMT might be e ective complementary and alternative treatments for in-patients with LBP . However, the poor methodological quality of the included RCTs means that high-quality RCTs with long follow-up are warranted. 1. Introduction Low back pain (LBP) and related disability are one of the major public health problems worldwide, which representa great nancial burden in the form of direct costs resultingfrom the loss of work and medical expenses, as well asindirect costs [ 1]. And the prevalence of LBP is quite high and increases according to the time span considered. The pointprevalence of bothersome LBP has been estimated at 25%,whereas the 1-year prevalence has been estimated at 50%and the lifetime prevalence has been estimated at 85% [ 2- 4]. Therefore, the adequate treatment of LBP is an important issue for patients, treating clinicians, and healthcare policymakers.Tuina, a manual therapy in traditional Chinese medicine, emphasizes anatomy and physiology when used for neuro-musculoskeletal disorders. Currently it is widely used forthe treatment of LBP . Tuina procedures for LBP are com-bined soft-tissue manipulation with spinal manipulation.Soft-tissue manipulation is similar to massage, includingstroking, kneading, and percussion. Spinal manipulation,on the other hand, is quite similar to mobilization andother adjustment techniques. These techniques can involvea manual procedure without thrust, during which a jointnormally remains within its physiological range of motion.Alternatively, they can involve a manual procedure directedthrust to move a joint past the physiological range of motion,without exceeding the anatomical limit [ 5]. The clinical2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine practice guidelines have formed moderate recommendations of massage, mobilization, and manipulation for LBP [ 6,7]. Some systemic reviews also concluded that these manualtherapies might be benecial for LBP [ 8-11]. But the evidence is only for single application of these manual ther-apies. In the last decade, a mass of hospitals have adopted Tuina-focused integrative Chinese medical therapies(TICMT) in the management of LBP for better e ectiveness in China, which consist of Tuina combined with othertraditional Chinese medical therapies including Chineseherbal medicine, acupuncture, moxibustion, and hot pack.In addition, a number of clinical studies on TICMT havebeen rolled out and published [ 12]. However, the evidence from systematic reviews on TICMT for LBP is marginal.Therefore, we performed a systematic review of all currentlyavailable data and conducted quantitative meta-analysesof TICMT for in-patients with LBP to determine whetherTICMT alternative treat- ments for in-patients with LBP . 2. Methods 2.1. Search. The following electronic databases were searched from January 2001 to June 2012: PubMed,EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China Knowledge ResourceIntegrated Database (CNKI), Weipu Database for ChineseT echnical Periodicals (VIP), and Wanfang Data. The rstsearch terms low back pain, lumbago, lumbar discherniation, lumbar sprain, backache, back pain, or dorsalgia. The second terms were Tuina, massage, mobilization, or spinal manipulation. The third search terms were acupunc-ture, electroacupuncture, herbal medicine, moxibustion,or hot pack, and the last search term was random. Wecombined these four terms for text word searches of titlesand abstracts. No restrictions on publication status wereimposed. The complete search strategies for each databasewere shown in Appendix A . 2.2. Study Selection. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TICMT for in-patients with LBP were included. Therewere no limitations on the participant's age, gender, ornationality. The included integrative therapies were Tuinacombined with other traditional Chinese medical thera- pies including Chinese herbal medicine (herbal decoctions and herbal injections), acupuncture (manual acupunc-ture and electroacupuncture), moxibustion, and hot pack.Control treatments included any independent traditionalChinese medical therapy, placebo, waiting list controls,and integrative treatments without any manual therapy.The main outcomes of interest were pain and functionalstatus. Trials were excluded if any of the following were identi- ed: (1) if the participants were outpatients; (2) if controlledtreatment was an integrative therapy including any manualtherapy. In this case, it would be impossible to evaluatethe specic e ect of Tuina combined with other traditionalChinese medical therapies; and (3) if the information about the outcome measures was not clearly reported. 2.3. Data Abstraction. Two authors extracted data inde- pendently according to predened criteria including therst author, year of the study, the mean duration of LBP ,sample size, the mean age of participants, the duration oftreatments, the follow-up time, main outcome assessments,interventions of TICMT and control group, and the mainconclusion (mean improvements). Any discrepancies werediscussed until the authors reached consensus. 2.4. Methodological Quality Assessment. The methodological quality of RCTs was assessed independently by two authorsby PEDro scale, which is based on the Delphi list andhas been reported to have a fair to good reliability forRCTs of the physiotherapy in systematic reviews. This scaleconsists of 11 criteria being (1) study eligibility criteriaspecied, (2) random allocation of subjects, (3) concealedallocation, (4) measure of similarity between groups atbaseline, (5) subject blinding, (6) therapist blinding, (7)assessor blinding, (8) less than 15% dropouts, (9) intention-to-treat analysis, (10) between-group statistical comparisons, and (11) point measures and variability data. Criteria (2)-(11) were used to calculate the PEDro score. Eachcriterion was scored as either 1 or 0 according to whetherthe criteria was met or not, respectively. The scores aresummed and a higher score represents a better method-ological quality. A cut point of 6 on the PEDro scalewas used to indicate high quality studies as this has beenreported to be su cient to determine high quality versus low quality in previous studies [ 33]. If additional data or clarication was necessary, we contacted the study authors.And disagreements were resolved by discussions among theauthors. 2.5. Data Synthesis and Analysis. The mean change in out- come measures between the end of the nal intervention andthe baseline was used to assess the di erence between TICMT group and control group in the meta-analyses. Standardisedmean di erences (SMDs) were used because the studies measured the outcomes based on di erent scales (e.g., V AS 0-10 and V AS 0-100). And SMDs and 95% condenceintervals (CIs) were calculated in the meta-analysis. In studies that involved more than one control group, the authors restricted our analyses to TICMT and each controlgroup. Summary estimates of the treatment e ect were calculated using the random e ects model to account for the expected heterogeneity. Cochrane's Qtest andI 2were used to assess statistical authors determinedthat there was considerable heterogeneity when Cochrane'sQtest result was determined with P< 0.10, andI 2was above 75%. The Cochrane Version 5.0 for Windows; Copenhagen: The NordicCochrane Centre) was used for the meta-analyses. And theresults of study characteristics are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or the range of variation.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 Records before duplicates removed Reasons for exclusion Full text screening Reasons for exclusion Title and abstract screening Full text screening Included studiesPubMed, n=10 Not use TICMT, n=85 Unsuitable control intervention, n=55 Not report the outcome of interest, n=68 Full text not available, n=17 n=49 Duplicate publications, n=2 Unsuitable control intervention, n=1 Unsuitable reports of the outcome, n=13 Included RCTs, n=20 Tuina plus Chinese herbal medicine, n=7 Tuina plus acupuncture, n=7 Tuina plus moxibustion, n=1 Tuina plus hot pack, n=2 Tuina plus more than one Chinese medical therapy, n=3 All RCTs were included in meta-analyses n=20Outpatients, n=13 Figure 1: Study process.

After the initial titles and abstractsscreening, we excluded 904 because of a large number ofduplicate records from three Chinese databases (CNKI, VIP ,and Wanfang) and some reports did not met the inclusion criteria. We retrieved and reviewed 49 full articles. 20 RCTs were eligible [ 13-32]. In excluded studies, the trials were excluded due to outpatients ( n =13), duplicate publications (n=2), unsuitable control intervention ( n=1), and unsuitable reports of the outcome ( n=13). And all RCTs were included in meta-analyses. The study selection processwas summarized in Figure 1 . 3.2. Study Characteristics. Twenty eligible studies included 2147 subjects with the mean age of 43. And all studieswere conducted in China between 2005 and 2012. The disease duration ranged from 1 day to 10 years, and thestudy duration ranged from 3 days to 8 weeks. The timeand session of Tuina treatment were 26.3 \u00b14.4 minutes (ranging from 20 to 30 minutes) and 17.5 \u00b110.5 (ranging from 3 to 42), respectively. In combined traditional Chinesetherapies, the number of Chinese herbal medicine every dayranged from 1 to 3, and acupuncture points were 6.2 \u00b13.1 (ranging from 1 to 10). The hot pack time ranged from 30to 360 minutes. The follow-up time ranged from 4 to 24weeks. Of twenty RCTs, 7 RCTs assessed the e ectiveness of Tuina plus Chinese herbal medicine for in-patients with LBP [ 13-19], 7 RCTs assessed the e ect of Tuina plus acupuncture [ 20-26], 2 RCTs assessed the e ect of Tuina plus hot pack [ 27,28], and one assessed the e cacy of Tuina plus moxibustion [ 29]. The others assessed the e ectiveness of4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Tuina plus more than one Chinese medical therapy [ 30- 32]. The control therapies contained Tuina, Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture, moxibustion, traction, electromag-netic therapy, or integrated treatments (including Chineseherbal medicine plus traction, Chinese herbal hot packplus traction, Chinese herbal hot pack plus electromagne- totherapy, and traction plus infrared radiation). In outcome assessments, visual analog scale (V AS) was used for pain, andthe Oswestry disability index (ODI) or Japanese orthopaedicassociation score for low back pain (JOA) was used forfunctional status. The characteristics of all studies weresummarized in Table 1 . 3.3. Methodological Quality. The quality scores were pre- sented in Table 2 . The quality scores ranged from 5 to 8 points out of a theoretical maximum of 10 points. Althoughthe predetermined cuto 6 was exceeded by most studies included, it did not indicate that they were consideredto be of high quality, because most of them (80% ofstudies) were at the limit of the cuto with scores of 6. And there were serious flaws in concealed allocation (90% of studies), subjects blinded (100% of studies), therapists blinded (100% of studies), and assessors blinded (95% ofstudies). In addition, two studies were failed in randomallocation, because the patients were randomly allocated byhospital record number. In other items on PEDro scale,the studies showed higher methodological quality involvingmeasure of similarity between groups at baseline, less than15% dropouts, intention-to-treat analysis, between-groupstatistical comparisons, and point measures and variabilitydata. 3.4. Quantitative Data Synthesis 3.4.1. E ects of TICMT on Pain. Six RCTs tested the e ective- ness of Tuina plus Chinese herbal medicine on pain for LBPcompared with Tuina [ 13-15,19], Tuina (or Chinese herbal medicine) [ 17], and Chinese herbal medicine plus traction [16]. And the meta-analysis showed favorable e ects of Tuina plus Chinese herbal medicine on pain ( n =765; Table 3 ). Five trials assessed the e ect of Tuina plus acupuncture on pain for LBP versus Tuina [ 20], Tuina (or acupuncture) 23], traction [ 24], and electro- Chinese herb hot pack [ 25]. The meta- analysis showed superior e ects of Tuina plus acupuncture on pain relief And one study tested the e ectiveness of Tuina plus acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine on pain for LBPcompared with Tuina [ 31]. The meta-analysis ). One RCT tested the e ectiveness of Tuina plus moxibus- tion on pain for LBP versus Tuina or moxibustion [ 29]. The meta-analysis did not shown favorable e ects of plusmoxibustion on pain reduction Table 3 ). In addition, Tuina plus hot pack did not show better e ects on pain than Tuina ( n=120; ects of TICMT on Functional Status. Two RCTs tested the e ect of Tuina plus Chinese herbal medicine on functional status for LBP compared with Tuina [ 13,18]. And the meta-analysis showed favorable e ects of Tuina plus Chinese herbal medicine on functional status 4 ). Two trials assessed the e ect of Tuina plus acupuncture on functional status versus traction plus infrared radiation[21] or acupuncture [ 26]. Two studies maintained that in-patients in Tuina plus acupuncture group experienced more obvious improvements on functional status. And themeta-analysis also showed superior e ects of Tuina plus acupuncture on functional status ( 4 ). In addition, Tuina plus Chinese herbal hot pack showed better e ects on functional status than Tuina 4 )[27]. Two trials assessed the e ect of Tuina plus more than one Chinese medical therapy on functional status for LBPversus traction plus Chinese herbal hot pack [ 30] and Tuina [32]. Tuina coupled with traction and Chinese herbal hot pack and Tuina coupled with acupuncture and moxibustionwere, respectively, employed in two trials. And the meta-analysis showed favorable e ects of Tuina plus more than one Chinese medical therapy on functional status ( n =203; ). 3.5. Long-Term E ects of TICMT. Three studies observed the long-term e ect of TICMT for in-patients with LBP . But only one trial reported that TICMT group (Tuinaplus acupuncture) experienced better improvements onfunctional status compared with acupuncture (recurrencerate, 6.2% versus 25.9%) [ 26]. The other two did not show detailed results [ 13,22]. 4. Discussion In summary, there are encouraging results suggesting that TICMT has short-term e ects on improving pain and functional status of in-patients with LBP , especially Tuinaplus Chinese herbal medicine or acupuncture. But thequality of the included studies was generally poor. AndTuina plus hot pack or moxibustion did not show bettereects on pain relief, which might be explained by the fact that there are relatively fewer eligible studies. In addition,the studies of long-term e ects of TICMT were extremely insucient. Consequently, interpretation of these positive ndings should be cautions.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5 Table 1: Randomized controlled trials evaluating the e ect of Tuina-focused integrative Chinese medical therapies (TICMT) for low back pain (LBP).

The clinical guidelinefrom the United States in 2007 found the moderate-qualityevidence to support the e cacy of massage and spinal manipulation for the management of LBP [ 6]. The clinicalguidelines from Belgium in 2006 [ 4] and United Kingdom in 2009 [ 7] also found the moderate-quality evidence for spinal manipulation and recommended o ering a maximum of 9 sessions of spinal manipulation over a period of upto 12 weeks.

Some systematic reviews [ 34-36] and clinical guidelines [ 6,7] also found the evidence to support the e cacy of acupuncture with respect to improvements on pain and function. In addition,there were some recommendations of herbal medicines forLBP in systematic reviews [ 37,38] and clinical guidelines [3,6]. Although the evidence is only for single application of these therapies for LBP , they partly supported the e cacy of TICMT for the management of LBP . Comparing with thesesystematic reviews and clinical guidelines, there were somekey strong points in our systematic review. We assessed theintegrated e ect of TICMT for LBP by the qualitative review and quantitative meta-analyses for the rst time. AlthoughTICMT were widely used for the in-patients with LBP inChinese hospitals, the evidence from systematic reviews wasmarginal. We, on the other hand, separately assessed theeect of Tuina plus Chinese herbal medicine, Tuina plus acupuncture, Tuina plus moxibustion, Tuina plus hot pack,and Tuina plus more than one Chinese medical therapy. And the outcomes of interest contained pain and functionalstatus. So our systematic review provided stronger evidenceof TICMT for LBP . 4.1. Limitations of the Review. There are several limitations in our study. First, the distorting e ects of publication and location bias on systematic reviews and meta-analyses arewell documented [ 39,40]. We are condent that our search strategy located all relevant studies. However, some degreeof uncertainty remains. Another possible source of bias isthat more negative trials of TICMT for in-patients withLBP may be never published in the peer-reviewed literature.Secondly, the quality of the eligible studies was generallypoor, which indicated an unclear risk of bias resulting frominsucient reporting of methodological components in the trials. There were serious flaws in concealed allocation andblind methods in the eligible trials, which may have createdpotential performance biases and detection biases, as patientsEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 11 and assessors might have been aware of the therapeutic interventions. And improper blinding is likely to have led toan overestimation of the e ect. In addition, our review also may be a ected by the heterogeneity of traditional Chinese therapies. Based on traditional Chinese medicine theory,interventions were designed to be adapted according to the specic presentations of LBP , so these interventions were dierent in frequency and force of Tuina, type and dose of Chinese herbal medicine, and number of acupuncturepoints. Last, all eligible RCTs were conducted in China,which may be due largely to the acceptability and servicerestrictions of traditional Chinese medical therapies in theother countries. 4.2. The Possible Rationale of TICMT for LBP. Assuming that TICMT were benecial for LBP , the complex interplayof both physical and mental modes may provide a possiblerationale. The manual therapy delivered to soft and con-nective tissues may induce local biochemical changes thatmodulate local blood circulation, improve muscle flexibility,intensify the movement of lymph, and loosen adherentconnective tissue, which may alternately improve reuptakeof local nociceptive and inflammatory mediators [ 41,42]. These e ects may subsequently influence neural activity at the spinal cord segmental level, thereby modulatingthe activities of cerebral cortex that improve pain anddysfunction due to LBP [ 43]. In addition, manual therapy may impact the primary a erent neurons from paraspinal tissues, the motor control system, and pain processing [ 44]. Chinese herbal medicine and acupuncture may strengthenthe e ectiveness of these manual therapies in local blood circulation and nociceptive and inflammatory mediators,because isolated components of the Chinese herbs haveanti-inflammatory, antilipidemic, antioxidant, and immunemodulation properties [ 45]. And the acupuncture also works through the central nervous system by stimulating theproduction of endorphins and neurotransmitters that mod-ulate nociception and other involuntary bodily functions,or through the gate control theory of pain, in which thenociceptive input is inhibited in the central nervous systemin the presence of another type of input [ 46-48]. It also stimulates vascular and immunomodulatory factors involvedas mediators of inflammation [ 49]. 5. Conclusion Twenty RCTs were analyzed in our systematic review, evaluating TICMT in management of LBP . The ndings fromthe current studies suggest that TICMT might be e ective complementary and alternative treatments for in-patientswith LBP . However, the poor quality of the included studiesand the shortage of long-term e ects of TICMT suggest that the positive evidence is underpowered. Consequently, futurestudies should adhere to high-quality RCTs with long follow-up for demonstrating the e ectiveness of TICMT for in- patients with LBP .Appendices A. Search Strategies A.1.

Objectives . T o assess the benecial and adverse e ects of Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (LWDHW), combined with antihypertensive drugs, for essential hypertension. Methods . Five major electronic databases were searched up to August 2012 to retrieve any potential randomized controlled trials designed to evaluate the clinical e ectiveness of LWDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs for essential hypertension reported in any language, with main outcome measures as blood pressure. The quality of the included studies was assessed with the Jadad scale and a customized standard quality assessment scale. Results . 6 randomized trials were included. The methodological quality of the trials was evaluated as generally low. The pooled results showed that LWDHWcombined with antihypertensive drugs was more e ective in blood pressure and the scale for TCM syndrome and symptom dierentiation scores compared with antihypertensive drugs alone. Most of the trials did not report adverse events, and the safety is still uncertain. Conclusions . LWDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs appears to be e ective in improving blood pressure and symptoms in patients with essential hypertension. However, the evidence remains weak due to the poor methodological quality of the included studies. 1. Introduction Hypertension is one of the most prevalent and important public health concerns in both developed and developingcountries [ 1-3]. Several studies have demonstrated that successful long-term treatment of hypertension has a sig-nicant impact on morbidity and mortality for cardio-vascular disease (CVD) and stroke. However, only 53%of patients treated for hypertension had blood pressureactually controlled to 140/90 mmHg [ 4]. Considering these data and the seriousness of the e ects of hypertension on the individual and society as a whole, both economicallyand socially, physicians must look for more e ective and alternative ways to achieve the target blood pressure asquickly as possible. Can integrative medicine contribute to combat hypertension more e ectively? Integrative medicine is a relative new discipline which attempts to combine complementary and alternativemedicine (CAM) with Western medicine [ 5]. As Western medicine has been developed based on the scientic method,integrative medicine, therefore, combines the latest modernscientic advances with the most profound perspectivesof CAM to regain and preserve health [ 6]. In China, the integrative medicine mainly refers to the integratedtraditional Chinese and Western medicine. TraditionalChinese medicine (TCM), including herbal medicine andacupuncture, is one of the most important parts in CAM.TCM has long been used in the treatment of a wide variety2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine of illnesses including hypertension [ 7,8]. Much of the past literature reflects clinical observations made by physicians intheir o ces. More recently, with more and more reports of the signicance of disease-syndrome combination [ 9], there are also large numbers of controlled studies based on theuse of combination of TCM and Western medicine in the treatment of hypertension [ 10-14]. Liu Wei Di Huang Wan (LWDHW), a traditional Chinese patent medicine containing six commonly usedherbs ( Rehmanniae radix ,p u l is widely used to treat hypertension-related signs and symptoms in clinicalpractice for centuries in China. Recent research showed thatLWDHW could lower blood pressure. The mechanism of theprescription maybe related to enriching yin and nourishingkidney in TCM. Biochemically, LWDHW also showed goodeect in decreasing the concentrations of ET and vWF in plasma, increasing the content of NO and protecting thefunction of kidney with essential hypertension [ 15,16]. Our previous studies have showed that kidney deciency syndrome is one of the most important pathogenesis ofessential hypertension in TCM, which could be well treatedby LWDHW [ 17]. LWDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs, a new integrative medicine therapy, has been widelyused as an alternative and e ective method for treating essential hypertension in China currently. A large number ofclinical studies reported the clinical e ect of LWDHW and LWDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs rangingfrom case reports and case series to controlled observationalstudies and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) until now. However, there is no a critically appraised evidence such as systematic reviews or meta-analyses on potential benet andsafety of LWDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs foressential hypertension to justify their clinical use and theirrecommendation. Understanding the e ect of LWDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs on blood pressure,hypertension-related signs and symptoms, quality of life(QOF), and cardiovascular risk factors could be valuable foressential hypertension management. The present paper aimsto evaluate the benecial and harmful e ects of LWDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs for treatment ofessential hypertension in randomized trials. 2. Methods 2.1. Database and Search Strategies. The literature searches were conducted in Chinese National Knowledge Infrastruc-ture (CNKI), Chinese Scientic Journal Database (VIP),Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), PubMed,and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials(CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library (August, 2012). Allof those searches ended on 10 August, 2012. Ongoingregistered clinical trials were searched in the website ofChinese clinical trial registry ( http://www.chictr.org/ )a n d international clinical trial registry by the US nationalinstitutes of health ( http://clinicaltrials.gov/ ). The following search used individually combined: \"essentialhypertension\" , \"hypertension,\" \"Liu trial,\" and \"randomized controlled trial.\" The bibliographies of the included studieswere searched for additional references. 2.2. Inclusion Criteria. All the randomized controlled tri- a l s( R C T s )o fa l lt h ep r e s c r i p t i o n sb a s e do n\" L i uW e iDi Huang Wan\" combined with antihypertensive drugs compared with antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension were included. There were no restrictions onpopulation characteristics, language, and publication type.The primary outcome measure was blood pressure (BP),and the secondary outcome measure was the scale for TCMsyndrome and symptom di erentiation (TCM-SSD) scores. The criteria \"signicant e ective, e ective, or not e ective\" was also included in the outcome measurement. Duplicatedpublications reporting the same groups of participants wereexcluded. 2.3. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment. Two authors conducted the literature searching (X. J. Xiong, K. W. Y ao),s t u d ys e l e c t i o n( X .J .X i o n g ,B .F e n g ) ,a n dd a t ae x t r a c t i o n(X. J. Xiong, X. Du) independently. The extracted dataincluded authors, title of study, year of publication, studysize, age and sex of the participants, details of methodologicalinformation, name and component of Chinese herbs, treat-ment process, details of the control interventions, outcomes(e.g., blood pressure), and adverse e ects for each study. Disagreement was resolved by discussion and reached con-sensus through a third party (J. Wang). The methodologicalquality of trials was assessed using the 6 criteria 6 electionbias (study design, confounders, blinding, data collectionmethods, withdrawals, and dropouts) to follow 3 categories:Category A (strong quality): four strong ratings with no weak ratings above. Category B (moderate quality): less than four strong ratings and one weak rating. Category C (weakquality): two or more weak ratings. The quality of includedtrials were assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Chapter 8.5) to address the following ve criteria: sequence generation, allocationconcealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selectiveoutcome reporting, and other sources of bias. 2.4. Data Synthesis. Revman 5.1 software provided by Cochrane Collaboration was used for data analyses. Dichoto-mous data were expressed as relative risk (RR) and con-tinuous outcomes as weighted mean di erence (WMD), both with 95% condence intervals (CI). Meta-analysis wasperformed if the intervention, control, and outcome were thesame or similar. The statistical heterogeneity was presentedas signicant when Isquare (I 2) is over 50% or P< 0.1. In the absence of signicant heterogeneity, we pooled data usinga x e d - e ect model ( I 2<50%), otherwise we used random eects model ( I2>50%) [ 24]. 3. Result 3.1. Description of the Included Trials. After primary search of 5 databases, 340 trials were screen out from electronicEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 Table 1: Characteristics and methodological quality of the included studies.

After reading the titles andabstracts, a majority of studies were excluded, and only133 studies were got. 89 trials were excluded because of duplicated publication, 6 trials were excluded due to the animal studies, and the rest 112 trials were noncontrolledclinical trials including case report, case series traditionalreview. 127 out of the rest of 133 articles were excludedbased on the inclusion criteria. In the end, 6 RCTs werereviewed [ 18-23]. All the trials were conducted in China and published in Chinese. The characteristics of 6 randomizedtrials were summarized in Table 1 . The 6 RCTs involved 555 patients with essential hyper- tension. There was a wide variation in the age of subjects(33-78 years). 6 trials specied three diagnostic criteriaof hypertension, two trials [ 18,22] used 1999 WHO- ISH guidelines for the management of hypertension (1999WHO-ISH GMH), one trial [ 20] used Chinese Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension-2005 (CGMH-2005),one trial [ 21] used 1993 WHO-ISH guidelines for the management of hypertension (1993 WHO-ISH GMH), andtwo trials [ 19,23] only demonstrated patients with essential hypertension. Only one trial [ 23] demonstrated patients with yin-deciency and excessive yang syndrome in TCM, andthe rest trials have not reported TCM diagnostic criteriayet. The interventions of all the trials [ 18-23] included LWDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs as shown in Table 1 . The controls included antihypertensive drugs alone. The total treatment duration ranged from 4 weeks to 18weeks. All of the 6 trials used the blood pressure (BP) as themain outcome measure. Other outcome measures includethe scale for TCM syndrome and symptom di erentiation (TCM-SSD). Adverse e ect was described in details.

Methodological Quality of Included Trials. The method- ological quality of all the included RCTs was assessed to be ofgeneral low according to the predened quality assessmentcriteria as shown in Table 2 . The randomized allocation of participants, allocation concealment and double-blind werenot mentioned in all the six trials. Only one trial [ 18]h a s reported drop-out. None of trials had a pre-trial estimationof sample size, which indicated the lack of statistical powerto ensure appropriate estimation of the therapeutic e ect.4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 2: Quality assessment of the included randomized controlled trials.

We have tried to contacte the authors for further detailed information aboutthe article, but regrettably no information could be got tillnow. 3.3. E ect of the Interventions 3.3.1. Blood Pressure. Three trials [ 18,20,21] used blood pressure decrease to measure the outcome: signicant eective (diastolic blood pressure decreased by 10 mmHg reaching the normal range, or diastolic blood pressurehas not yet returned to normal, but has been reduced 20 mmHg), e ective (diastolic blood pressure decreased to less than 10 mmHg reaching the normal range, ordiastolic blood pressure decreased by 10-19 mmHg, butdid not reach the normal range, or systolic blood pressuredecreased 30 mmHg), and ine ective (not to meet the above standards). The trial showed signicant di erence between treatment and control group on the three criteriaoutcome measurement (RR: 2.77 (1.37, 5.57); P =0.004). Five trials 19-21, 23-24 compared the e ectiveness using the blood pressure value, and signicant di erence was found between treatment and control systolic 5). Two trials [ 21,22] used the TCM- SSD scores to measure the outcome: signicant e ective (The main symptoms such as headache, dizziness, palpitations,insomnia, tinnitus, and irritability disappear, or TCM-SSDscores reduced rate 70%), e ective (the main symptoms relieved, or 70% >TCM-SSD scores reduced rate 30%), and ine ective (the main symptoms do not change, or TCM- SSD scores reduced rate <30%). There is only one trial [ 21]who reported the TCM-SSD scores decrease. The meta- analysis showed there is signicant benecial e ect on the combination group compare to the antihypertensive drugsusing alone (RR: 3.04 1.10, 8.38; P 6 ). The other trial [ 22]r e p o r t e dt h a ta f t e r1 8w e e k so ft r e a t m e n t , the scores of main symptoms in hypertension, includingheadache, insomnia, amnesia, waist soreness, and tinnitus,decreased signicantly. As we cannot obtain more detailsof the TCM-SSD scores, so we cannot get the analysis of comparison between groups ( Table 6 ). 3.3.3. Other Outcomes. One trial [ 18] showed that after 8 weeks of treatment, the serum level of ET decreased and NO increased in both groups with signicant di erence in LWDHW plus sustained-release nifedipine group comparedto sustained-release nifedipine group. One trial [ 19] showed that after 4 weeks of treatment, 2-MG reduced signicantly in treatment group compared to control group. One trial[20] showed that signicant di erence was found between treatment and control group in BUN and Cr after 8 weeks oftreatment. One trial [ 22] reported that signicant di erence w a sf o u n db e t w e e nt r e a t m e n ta n dc o n t r o lg r o u pi nI g Ga n dC 3after 18 weeks of treatment. One trial [ 23] showed that IgG and C 3decreased in the treatment group. 3.4. Sensitivity Analysis, Subgroup Analysis, and Publication Bias. T h en u m b e ro ft r i a l sw a st o os m a l lt oc o n d u c ta n y sucient additional analysis of sensitivity, subgroup, and publication bias. 3.5. Adverse E ect. Only one trial mentioned the adverse eect [ 20]. It mentioned adverse e ect such as dry cough during the course. It may be related to the adverse e ect of captopril.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5 Table 4: Analyses of systolic blood pressure. Trials WMD (95% LWDHW WMD (95% CI) Pvalue 4. Discussion This paper included 6 randomized trials and a total of 555 participants. Liu Wei Di Huang Wan combined withantihypertensive drugs, a new integrative medicine therapy,showed signicant benet on decreasing blood pressure andimproving symptoms and signs as compared with conven-tional treatment for essential hypertension. However, dueto the low-quality methodology and potential publicationbias, a denite conclusion of the benecial e ectiveness of LWDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs in treatingessential hypertension could not be drawn. The positivendings should be interpreted conservatively due to thefollowing facts. All the six trials included had improper study design or method used, such as lack of randomization or allocationconcealment. No trials reported randomization procedureclearly and only mentioned that \"patients were randomizedinto two groups\" . So, it is hard to judge whether random-ization was conducted properly and really. All the trialshaven't mentioned allocation concealment and double-blind.Therefore, it is possible that some of the trials are not trueRCTs. And two trials including Cai 2004 and Zhang 2007[18,19], only have one author. It is impossible for an RCT to be done properly in terms of randomization and allocation concealment by one doctor totally. Publication bias couldalso be a factor. We have tried to take all measures to contactauthors to get further information either by telephone oremail. Unfortunately, no replies and informations was got.Subsequently, no clear conclusion could be made from thesetrials.Adverse e ect was reported by Chen et al. in 2008 [ 20] as only dry mouth. The adverse e ect was not severe, and it spontaneously recovered without special treatment. Theother 5 trials did not report any adverse e ects and these were not signicantly di erent between the two treatments. Therefore, due to the limited and inadequate evidenceprovided by the eligible trials, conclusions about the safety of LWDHW combined with antihypertensive drugs cannot be made from this paper. Large-scale clinical trials with long-term followup were warranted to assess the safety of newintegrative medicine therapy properly. Syndrome is a classication according to subjective symptom and objective sign collected by physician throughinspection, auscultation-olfaction, interrogation and palpa-tion [ 25]. Syndrome di erentiation is the basic rule in TCM. Failure to apply syndrome di erentiation to clinical trials may result in treatments being ine ective or even harmful, and failure to evaluate the real e cacy of TCM. In this paper, only one trial [ 23] reported the TCM diagnostic criteria but without further details. The rest ve trials [ 18-22] did not report TCM diagnostic criteria. If syndrome di erentiation in TCM was considered into the studies properly, the positiveeects could be enhanced. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, because of the unclear methodological quality of these including trials, a denite conclusion on e cacy and safety associated with Liu Wei Di Huang Wan combined withantihypertensive drugs cannot be drawn from this paper.6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 6: Analyses of TCM-SSD scores.

Introduction . The Department for Internal and Integrative Medicine in Essen utilizes mind/body medical elements in order to empower patients with chronic diseases to better cope with their symptoms and to adopt a healthy lifestyle. This study explored the influence and predictors of a 2-week integrative treatment program on patients' quality of life. Methods . This observational study was conducted with inpatients as part of the quality assurance program. Patients' quality of life, psychological symptoms, and health locus of control were measured on admission and discharge and again 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge. Regression analyses were conducted to determine the fac tors predicting improved quality of life. Results . Data from 2486 inpatients treated in 2001-2004 were included (80% female, mean age 53.9 \u00b114.3 years). Response rates decreased to 50% at 12 months. Small- to-moderate e ects were found on patients' quality of life, anxiety, and depression. Patients' internal locus of control signicantly increased. Improved quality of life was mainly predicted by lower baseline scores. Conclusion . Results of this study suggest that a 2-week inpatient treatment might sustainably reduce patients' symptoms and increase their quality of life; however, conclusionsare only preliminary. More research is needed to enable the e ectiveness to be judged conclusively. 1. Introduction Integrative treatment approaches are becoming increasingly important. This is especially the case in treating chronicdiseases; long-term conditions that develop slowly over timeoften progress in severity and rarely can be cured [ 1]. Treat- ing such diseases, including musculoskeletal, cardiovascular,digestive, and metabolic disorders, uses up nearly 80% ofnations' health budgets and imposes immense individualburdens [ 2-4]. Chronic diseases impair physical and mental health and reduce one's ability to carry out activities of daily living [ 5]. For example, studies have shown that physical illness is an important risk factor for anxiety and depression[6,7] and that depression is a risk factor for physical illness [8]. Although much progress has been made to date in drug development and medical technology, patients and theirpsychosocial needs are less often involved in the therapeutic process. Despite the e ect that psychological health and lifestyle factors are known to have on health and disease in patients with chronic health conditions [ 9], few change their lifestyles [ 10]. Empowering patients to adopt healthy lifestyles may enhance the e ects of any treatments received and reduce future health risks. The Department for Internal and Integrative Medicine at Kliniken Essen-Mitte, the University of Duisburg-Essen'sacademic teaching hospital, was established in 1999. TheClinic combines conventional medicine, complementarymedicine, and Mind/Body therapies to treat patients withchronic diseases [ 11,12]. The Mind/Body therapies were added specically to promote patients' active participationin their care. Mind/Body therapies are dened as \"practicesthat focus on the interactions between the brain, mind,body, and behaviour, with the intention of using the2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine mind to a ect physical functioning and promote health\" [13]. Such therapies include lifestyle education: seeking to enhance patients' capacity for self-care through suchelements as exercise, good nutrition, relaxation, and self-help [ 12,14,15]. Although Mind/Body programs are not overtly psychotherapeutic, aspects of cognitive behavioural therapy are used to enhance patients' ability to cope with their condition, and its impact on daily life, and to live ahealthy lifestyle. Research shows such programs' e ectiveness for conditions including coronary heart disease [ 16-18], inflammatory bowel disease [ 19,20], and cancer [ 21]. Patients' control beliefs are also considered key in ensuringlong-term treatment e ectiveness [ 22]. Patients who have an internal locus of control (believe that they are able improvetheir own health) should use active coping strategies moreoften than other patients. This observational study was conducted to explore the influence of a 2-week integrative treatment program onpatients' quality of life, psychological symptoms, and locusof control and to determine the factors predicting improvedquality of life. 2. Methods 2.1. Design and Patients. This observational study was con- ducted at the Department for Internal and IntegrativeMedicine in Essen [ 11], Germany, as part of its ongoing quality assurance program. The Clinic was established as amodel clinic in 1999 to treat patients with chronic diseasesof rheumatological, gastrointestinal, pulmonological, and cardiovascular origin, including those with chronic pain syndromes. Referrals come from specialist and generalpractitioners, with treatment costs being met by statutoryhealth insurance and many private health insurance com-panies. The quality assurance program evaluates the Clinic'stherapeutic results and cost-e ectiveness on behalf of the North Rhine-Westphalia federal state government. Previouspartial publication of these results [ 16,22] omitted the rst year of evaluation [ 22] and specic patient subgroups [23]. Data on the Clinic's cost-e ectiveness are not reported here. All patients admitted to the Clinic between January 2001 and January 2004 received detailed study informationand were invited to participate in this study. Patients whowere willing to participate signed informed consent forms.Participants received questionnaires on their admission to(ADM) and discharge from (DIS) a 2-week inpatient hospitalstay, with further questionnaires at 3-(FU3), 6-(FU6), and 12month (FU12) intervals after discharge. 2.2. Intervention. Patients received two weeks of integrative inpatient hospital treatment; following individual treatmentplans developed from extensive anamneses by physicians,nurses, and mind/body therapists. Treatments included con-ventional diagnostic and interventional medical approaches,including physiotherapy, and the use of complementary tech-niques. The latter included the use of traditional medicine(Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture, cupping, leech- ing, etc.) and classical naturopathy (hydrotherapy, ther-motherapy, manual therapy, massage, phytotherapy, exercise,nutritional therapy, and fasting). Patients also received sev-eral mind/body therapy sessions, focusing on exercise, stress-reduction, diet, and self-help, to empower them to adopt healthy lifestyles. These sessions were based on Harvard Medical School's Benson-Henry Institute for Mind/BodyMedicine Program [ 24] and the University of Massachusetts' Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program [ 25,26]. Ele- ments of cognitive restructuring were also added in this study[27,28]. 2.3. Outcome Measures. The following were used to evaluate patients' postintervention change. 2.4. Primary Outcome Measure 2.4.1. Health Related Quality of Life (SF-36). Patients' health- related quality of life was assessed using the short form 36of the health survey questionnaire (SF-36) [ 29]. This tool measures individuals' quality of life on eight dimensionsand two main component scales (physical, mental). It hasproven validity and reliability [ 29]. Each scale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher quality of life.In this study, only the main component summaries wereanalysed; comparing the outcome with age- and gender-matched values from the German general population [ 30, 31]. The di erences found are presented as z-scores, with 0 representing the mean and 1 the standard deviation ofthe population. The SF-36 assesses quality of life by meansof daily living activities, making its use inappropriate in ahospital setting. The SF-36 was, therefore administered atADM, FU3, FU6, and FU12, but not at discharge, in thisstudy. 2.5. Secondary Outcome Measures 2.5.1. Anxiety and Depression (HADS). Changes in patients' psychological symptoms were measured using the HospitalAnxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). This tool has 14items, scored on 4 point Likert scales [ 32]. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. For both dimensions, cut-oscores have been introduced to indicate possible sub- syndromal ( 8) or clinically relevant ( 11) anxiety or depression [ 33]. Study patients completed the HADS at admission, discharge, and followup. 2.5.2. Health Locus of Control (GK \u00a8U). Patients' viation for Gesundheitsbezogene Kontroll version in German of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Questionnaire (MHLC) [ 36]. The patients' internal, external-social,and external-fatalistic. The more internal control patientsperceive, the more they feel able to influence their health. Bycontrast, the more control that patients attribute to othersEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 (external-social), or to luck or destiny (external-fatalistic), the less they feel able to influence their health. The GK \u00a8Uw a s originally devised for use with patients with cancer, but hassince been adapted for use with other patients, such as thosewith back pain [ 37]. A previous study reported problems with one item on the GK \u00a8U[38]. A factor analysis undertaken with the present study data showed that this item loaded on two factors equally. It was therefore deleted from the analysis[38]. Patients completed the GK \u00a8U at admission, discharge, and followup. 2.5.3. Satisfaction with Health and Life in General (FLZ). Patients' satisfaction with their health and lives in general wasmeasured using two 5-point Likert items from the Life Satis-faction Questionnaire (Fragebogen zur Lebenszufriedenheit,FLZ) [ 39] at admission, discharge, and followup. The scale used ranged from 1 =very dissatised to 5 =very satised, with higher scores indicating patients' greater satisfactionwith their health and lives in general. 2.5.4. Demand on Medical Services. The study questionnaire also asked patients to record how many doctors' visits theyhad made during the previous month. Patients were alsoasked, at admission and 12-month followup, how many daysthey had been admitted for hospital inpatient treatment andhow many days they had missed work (where appropriate)over the previous year. 2.5.5. Improvement in Disease-Related Symptoms. At dis- charge and each followup, patients compared their maindisease-related symptoms with before they entered treat-ment, using a 5-point Likert scale that ranged from \"muchworse\" to \"much improved.\" 2.5.6. Statistical Analysis. All analyses were based on full data sets with no missing data. Baseline comparisons andcomparisons between responders and non-responders wereconducted using t-tests for independent groups, for para- metric data, and x 2-tests for nonparametric data. Responders were dened as patients who returned their questionnairesat given time points, with nonresponders being those whofailed to do so. Repeated analyses of variance (ANOV A) were used to analyse the study's primary and secondary outcome meas-ures as appropriate. Residuals were checked visually for normal distribution. The homogeneity of variance was tested using a Mauchly test for sphericity. Cases of nonsphericitywere corrected using a Greenhouse-Geisser correction. Theestimated di erences between the time points, from the ANOV A analyses, and their 95% Condence Intervals, werereported for each outcome. E ect size Cohen's d (the estimated di erences from the ANOV A analyses divided by the standard deviation of patients' admission scores) was alsogiven. Changes in patients' disease-related symptoms wereexplored solely descriptively. Analyses were conducted in the following order to de- termine the factors influencing the study's primary outcomemeasure: (1) correlations were used 2175 1524 questionnaires 1434 questionnaires 2486 questionnaires returned at ADM2804 questionnaires handed out returned at DIS (87.5%) returned at FU3 (61.3%) returned at FU6 (57.7%) returned at FU12 (48.2%) Figure 1: Flowchart of patient response rates. possible links between patients' sociodemographic char- acteristics, their scores at admission and their outcomeat discharge and followup. (2) Factors with signicantcorrelations ( r 0.1) were entered as possible predictors into the regression analysis. Patients' age and gender wereautomatically included in each regression. (3) Linear forwardstepwise regression analysis with linear outcome and linearor dichotomous regressors was then conducted. All analyses were conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) (V ersion 20.0, IBM, USA). Thesignicance level was set at =5%. An automatic Bonfer- roni correction was applied for the posthoc comparison ofthe main ANOV A e ects. 3. Results 3.1. Patients' Characteristics. The study's response rates are shown in Figure 1. Of the 2804 patients treated between January 2001 and January 2004, 2486 agreed to participatein the study on admission. The initial response rate of 87.5%on discharge, diminished to 61.3%, 57.7%, and 48.2% at 3, 6and 12 months' followup. The numbers of patients includedin the analyses are shown in each of the following tables.Since only complete patients' data sets were included in the4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine analyses, a missing score at any time point led to exclusion of this patient's data. Ta bl e 1shows patients' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on admission. The study sample consistedmainly of women in their mid-50s; most of whom hadnot been educated to A-level standard. Men more often reported being in a relationship, with more education, more frequent absenteeism from work over the past year and lowerexpectations of improvement from their inpatient stay thanwomen. More than two thirds of the patients experienced a chronic pain condition, with back pain, headache, bromyal-gia and arthritis being the most frequently cited causesfor admission. More than half of the study patients werediagnosed as severely a ected by their disease conditions, with few being seen as only slightly a ected. Most patients had high expectations of complementary medicine's e ectiveness, with more than 80% expecting some improvement and few expecting none. The following results compare responders' and non- responders' sociodemographic and clinical characteristicsto indicate potential response bias, illustrate the primaryand secondary outcomes for patients with complete datasets, and present the regression analysis, for patients withcomplete data sets, to determine the factors associatedwith improvements in their quality of life after inpatienttreatment. 3.2. Comparison of Responders and Nonresponders. An eighth of patients (12.5%) were lost to followup between admissionand discharge. More than a third (38.7%) had withdrawnwithin three months of discharge (FU3), the time of thebiggest withdrawal. T able 2shows the signicant di erences found between responders and nonresponders. Ta bl e 2shows that responders stayed longer in hospital, experienced less psychological symptoms, and scored morehighly on the mental health component summary of the SF-36 than non-responders. Responders' levels of internal locusof control were also higher at baseline, and their external-fatalistic control beliefs lower, than nonresponders' . Threemonths posttreatment, responders' results also outstrippednon-responders' with regard to their satisfaction with theirlife in general and perceived improvements in their symp-toms at discharge. 3.3. Primary Outcome Measure 3.3.1. Health-related Quality of Life (SF-36). The physical (PCS) and mental component (MCS) summaries of patients' SF-36 scores increased from admission to FU3; remaining relatively stable thereafter, see T able 3.R e p e a t e dA N O V A analyses showed a signicant time e ect on both the PCS (P< 0.0001) and the MCS ( P< 0.0001). Patients' physical and mental component (MCS)were found to be signicantly higher at FU3, FU6 and FU12,when compared to admission. No statistical di erences were found between patients' follow-up measurements. The e ect sizes for patients' PCS and MCS summaries were smallto moderate. Altogether 41.3% and 44.3% had increased their PCS and MCS summaries respectively by more thanve points from discharge onwards; a clinically importantimprovement in their quality of life [ 29]. Compared to age- and gender-matched data from a normative German population, patients' PCS was z = 1.49 and their MCS z= 0.97 at admission; below the average of the corresponding norms. At FU3, study patients' PCS wasz = 1.01 and their MCS = 0.47; an improvement of 0.5z. 3.4. Secondary Outcome Measures 3.4.1. Anxiety and Depression (HADS). ANOV A analyses revealed e scores to be signicantly lower ondischarge and at followup than on admission. Although HADS-A and HADS-D increased on followup, they were still signicantly lower than on admission. The e ect sizes for anxiety and depression were moderate on discharge andsmall at followup, see T able 3. The proportion of patients with cut-o scores>8 (indicating subsyndromal anxiety or depression) and >11 (indicating a clinically relevant disorder) were signsof subsyndromal or Signicant changes were found for all three scales of the GK \u00a8Uo v e rt i m e( a l l P< 0.001). Discharge and follow-up scores were signicantly higher for internal and signicantly lower external-socialcontrol beliefs, compared to admission (see T able 3). Follow- up scores were also higher for external-fatalistic beliefs. The ratio of patients' internal to external control beliefs, suggesting a perceived shift in control beliefs, also increasedsignicantly over time ( P< 0.001), with all follow-up scores being signicantly higher than on admission. 3.4.3. Satisfaction with Health and Life in General (FLZ). Patients' satisfaction scores are shown in T able 3.A N O V A analysis showed signicant time e ects (P< 0.001), with increases in satisfaction with health found throughout thefollow-up period, compared to baseline. Patients' satisfactionwith their lives in general was higher than their satisfactionwith their health, on average. The ANOV A results alsoshowed signicant time e ects for patients' satisfaction with their in general ( P< 0.001), with signicant di erences found between baseline and all follow-up measurements.The increase in the latter, however, was only marginally. 3.4.4. Demand on Medical Services. In the posttreatment year (FU12), employed patients' absenteeism from work fell byEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5 Table 1: Sociodemographic and clinical data of patients at admission.

Patients' visits to doctors in the previous were also signicantly reduced ( P< 0.0001). No signicant change occurred in the number of nights that patients spent in hospital during this year. 3.4.5. Improvement of Disease-Related Symptoms. On dis- charge, almost 80% of the study patients rated their health asat least somewhat improved, with some 60% continuing todo so 12 months later. In contrast, at FU12, a fth of patients(20%) saw their health as worse than before admission.3.4.6. Predictors of Improvement in the Primary Outcome Measure. All of patients' socio-demographic and clinical admission data with signicant correlations of r 0.1 were entered into the predictor analysis, to determine the factors influencing the changes found in their SF36 physical(PCS) and mental (MCS) component summaries at 3-monthfollowup. The resulting analysis showed that change inpatients' PCS score at FU3 was predicted by their PCS scoreon admission ( = 0.33), their internal control beliefs on admission ( =0.13), age ( = 0.11), their MCS score on admission ( =0.13), a main diagnosis of a pain versus a6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 2: Signicant di erences at baseline characteristics and health change at discharge between responders and non-responders.

Discussion 4.1. Summary of the Results. This observational study inves- tigated changes occurring in patients with chronic conditionsfollowing a 2-week inpatient integrative program. The lattercombined conventional medicineand Mind/Body therapies aimed at empowering patients toadopt a healthy lifestyle. The results revealed a small-to-moderate, but sustained improvement in patients' perceivedquality of life, with regard to both its physical and mentalhealth aspects. Patients also reported reduced anxiety and depression, as measured on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). At the same time, patients' inter-nal locus of control increased and their external-social con-trol beliefs diminished. On the other hand, patients' external-fatalistic control beliefs rose signicantly over time. Patients'satisfaction with their health and lives in general increased.Employed patients reported fewer days' absenteeism and allpatients made fewer doctors' visits during the posttreatmentyear. Altogether, patients reported substantial benet fromtheir two weeks of integrated inpatient treatment. 4.2. Comparisons with the Literature. The above results are in line with those of other studies into the e ectiveness of inpatient treatments that include naturopathy and Tra-ditional Chinese Medicine [ 40-48]. Patients in these otherobservational trials also showed improved symptoms and health, as well as improved quality of life. The e ect sizes were also comparable between these studies, for example,Melchart et al. [ 47]f o u n de ects around d =0.5f o r changes to patients' PCS and MCS after 6 months, changes only marginally larger than those found in the present study. More than two fths of the patients in the presentstudy (42%) reported improvements of >5 points in the SF- 36, which is considered clinically relevant [ 49]. The e ect sizes for the HADS anxiety and depression scales weremoderate on discharge and small on followup, although thefrequency with which patients scored above the cut-o sf o r subsyndromal and clinically relevant anxiety and depressioneach fell by almost a third (33%). Patients with chronic conditions often su er from comorbid psychological disorders. Falls in the levels ofanxiety and depression that patients reported in this study,following their inpatient treatment may reflect improve-ments in their overall health. They may also reflect the impactof the psychosocial approaches used in the Mind/Bodytherapy element of the treatment received. The regression analysis conducted showed that the change in the SF-36 physical component summary waspredicted by patients' PCS score on admission. Patients withlower PCS scores on admission beneted most, perhapsbecause they began with very low scores and thus had moreroom to improve. The e ect might also reflect a regression to the mean. For the MCS at baseline, the link was reversed. The higher patients' MCS scores were on admission, the more their PCS scores improved at followup. Patients' pain diagnoses,age, and employment status also proved important in thisstudy. Patients who had nonpain diagnoses were youngerand were employed were more responsive, perhaps becauseEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7 Table 3: Pre- post- and follow-up scores, estimated di erences, and e ect sizes for study outcomes.

Comparable resultshave been found for patients with low back pain [ 50,51]. T ogether, these variables explained 12.4% of the variancefound, suggesting minor predictive power. For improvements in patients' MCS scores, lower MCS scores at admission, higher levels of satisfaction with health and life in general and a higher level of education provedsignicant. Higher degrees of satisfaction might be linked togreater levels of openness and appreciation which, togetherwith higher levels of education, might incline patientstowards psychosocial Mind/Body interventions. All of theselected factors, taken together, explained 24.4% of the MCSchange variance found. An internal locus of control proved the only signif- icant factor predicting change in patients' PCS scores,but did not influence their MCS scores. Improvementsin patients' physical health were perhaps linked to anincreased probability of adopting a healthy lifestyle inpatients with a more internal locus of control. Adequateexercise, nutrition, and relaxation are certainly consideredimportant to overall health and mortality [ 52-54]. Further research is needed to explore the link between patients'locus of control and their actual behaviours, given thatneither external-social nor external-fatalistic control beliefspredicted any study Although patients' external-fatalistic control beliefs increased during inpatient treatment,which was contrary to expectations, this change may reflectthe questionable discriminative power of the tool used. TheMind/Body program o ered at the Department for Internal and Integrative Medicine, based on similar programs used elsewhere, draws on patients' acceptance of their healthsituations. Accepting patients might be mistakenly seento have high external-fatalistic control beliefs because thequestionnaire used cannot distinguish between these twovariables. The study data provide no conclusive evidenceabout this matter. Further studies are therefore needed toevaluate the relationship between patients' locus of controland their acceptance of their health situations. Data onpatients' posttreatment demands on medical services wasalso inconclusive, although there was some suggestion offalls in absenteeism and the number of doctors' visitsmade. 4.3. Limitations of the Study. This study's ndings are weakened by its observational design; the lack of a control group renders the e ects indivisible from nonspecic e ects. There may also have been some selection bias, as 11.3% ofall treated patients chose not to participate in the study.Another problem resulted from the followup response ratethe loss of 50% of the patients at 12 months generatingmuch missing data. Whilst other quality assurance programshave experienced similar response rates [ 41,42], some have lost only 25% of their participants [ 47]. The followup losses experienced in the present study may mean that the reportedresults reflect a bias in patients' response behaviours. T odetect such a bias, responders' and nonresponders' socio-demographic and baseline characteristics were compared.Non-responders were found to have shorter clinic stays (potentially reducing delivery of the study discharge ques-tionnaire), more external-fatalistic control beliefs, higherdepression scores and less mental health than responders.They also cited less symptomatic improvement on dischargethen responders. T aken together, these comparisons suggest that patients with more disadvantageous control beliefs, greater psychological symptoms and less benet from treat-ment were more often lost to followup. The reported e ects might therefore be an overestimation and, in part, reflectregression to the mean. Since neither the patients nor the program has changed for the most part, these data, retrieved about 10 yearsago, are still valid and the results generalizable to currentconditions. The Clinic still provides internal and externalquality assurance program, but with other quality indices. 4.4. Future Research. This study's results suggest that patients experience benet from receiving two weeks of integrativeinpatient treatment, but more research is needed to conrm and extend them. Future studies should use more rigorous designs, such as randomised controlled trials, to explore linksbetween patients' sociodemographic, clinical characteristicsand selected outcome measures, delving into the nature ofand mechanisms behind these links. They should also focuson ways to enhance patient compliance. 5. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that a 2-week inpatienttreatment might sustainably reduce patients' somatic andpsychological symptoms and increase their quality of life;however, conclusions are limited by the observational studydesign and a high withdrawal rate. Increases in patients'quality of life were predicted by several variables; the mostimportant being low quality of life at admission. Moreresearch is needed for conclusive judgment of integratedinpatient treatment programs' e ectiveness and modes of action. Conflict of Interests All authors declare no conflict of interests.

Objective . T o determine the impact of an integrative medicine clinical pathways (CPs) on the length of in-hospital stay and on outcomes for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods . A multicenter nonrandomized controlled trial enrolling 197 consecutive patients with AMI at eight urban TCM hospitals was conducted between 1 January 2010 and 31 October 2010. These patients were enrolled in the interventional group afte r the CPs had been implemented. The control group included 405 patients with AMI from eight hospitals; these patients were treated between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2009, before theCPs were implemented. Outcome measures were the length of hospital stay costs of medical care, and major cardiovascular events (MACEs) during hospitalization. Results . Compared with the control group, the patients in intervention group had a shorter length of hospital stay (9 .2 \u00b14.2d a y sv e r s u s1 2 .7\u00b18.6d a y s ,P<0.05), and reduced healthcare costs in hospital (46365 .7\u00b118266.9 versus 52866 .0\u00b135404.4,P< 0.05). There were statistically signicant di erences in MACE between the two groups during the hospitalization period (2.5% versus 6.9%, P=0.03). Conclusion . These data suggest that the development and implementation of the clinical pathways based in Integrative Medicine could further improve quality of care and outcome for patients with AMI. 1. Introduction Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a serious cardiovas- cular disease and is a leading cause of death worldwide. Inrecent years, the AMI incidence and mortality has decreasedsignicantly in America because early reperfusion and drugtreatment has been standardized [ 1]. However, it is estimated that with further economic development, aging of thepopulation, and changes in diet and physical activity inChina, the absolute number of AMI events and deaths willincrease dramatically in the next two decades [ 2]. There is also a discrepancy between guideline recommendations and2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine the current AMI management in most Chinese hospitals [3]. Therefore, strong evidence-based initiatives to improve patient management will be critical to address this challenge. TCM has been practiced for thousands of years, and it has made great contributions to peoples' health and wellbeing.Epidemiological data has suggested that Chinese herbal preparations may be benecial in reducing the mortality from AMI, and TCM treatment was shown to help improvethe quality of life for AMI patients [ 4]. TCM hospitals have the ability to perform reperfusion and to use drugsappropriately, and they are also making progress in theireort to follow the Clinical Guidelines. However, there are still situations that arise when using TCM to treatpatients with AMI, including a lack of standardized TCMsyndrome diagnosis, the need for syndrome di erentiation and treatment standardization, and clinical skills in reperfu-sion and standardized drug treatment, which require furtherimprovement [ 5]. Clinical pathways (CPs), also known as critical pathways, are management plans that display goals for patients andprovide the sequence and timing of actions necessary toachieve these goals with optimal e ciency. As competition in the healthcare industry has increased, CPs have beenwidely implemented as a method to reduce variation in careand potentially improve healthcare quality. Cardiovascularmedicine in particular is an area in which CPs have been usedextensively [ 6]. The evidence-based Integrative Medicine CPs, developed to improve the quality of healthcare, wasbased on published guidelines and the best research evidencefrom TCM and Western medicine [ 7]. Previous research has suggested that CPs may help to reduce costs while improving the quality of care for AMI patients [ 8]. However, the e ectiveness of Integrative Medicine CPs on improving AMI management is unclear. In previous studies, we developed CPs based on standard- ized therapy for AMI Integrative Medicine. The standard-ized management included thrombolysis therapy, primarypercutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), antiplatelet andanti-ischemic therapy, and TCM therapy (such as Astragalusinjection and compound Danshen dripping pills) to benetQi and to activate blood. A small single-center trial suggestedthat the CPs could reduce the length of the hospital stayand in-hospital health care costs for patients with AMI whounderwent PCI [ 9]. The purpose of this study is to assess further the influence of the Integrative Medicine CPs on carequality and outcomes among AMI patients in TCM hospitals,in a multicenter nonrandomized controlled trial. 2. Methods 2.1. Study Design and Setting. This trial is a multicenter, non- randomized retrospective study in eight hospitals (Guang-dong Provincial Hospital of TCM; Shuguang Hospital ofShanghai University of TCM; Yueyang Hospital of IntegratedMedicine of Shanghai University of TCM; Oriental Hospitalof Beijing University of TCM; Jiangsu Provincial Hospitalof TCM; 3rd A liated Hospital of Guangxi College Figure 1 ). This study (2008GL-35) was approved by the Ethical Committee of Guangdong ProvincialHospital of Chinese Medicine. 2.2. Study Patients. Inclusion criteria for this study included patients with acute myocardial infarction (onset of chest pain 24 h) admitted to emergency, and ages ranging from 18 to 80 years old who agreed to emergency reperfusion therapy(including intravenous thrombolysis or PCI). Exclusioncriteria included serious ventricular free wall rupture, ventricular septal perfora-tion, papillary adjacent chordal rupture), con- comitant diseases with aortic dissection, acute pulmonary embolism, severe liver failure, renal failure, mental illness,malignancy, hematopoietic tumor, nervous system primarydiseases, and pregnancy or lactation [ 10]. In our preliminary study, we found that Qi deciency and blood stasis were the main TCM syndromes for AMI[11]. In order to implement the AMI CPs conveniently in all hospitals, we considered Qi deciency and blood stasis as thebasic syndrome occasionally accompanied with Phlegm, Yin-deciency or Y ang-deciency of a single TCM syndrome ele-ment. The diagnostic criteria of the Qi deciency and bloodstasis were based on the TCM standard of coronary heartdisease, which was formulated by the Cardiovascular Societyof the National Association of Integrative Medicine [ 12]. Sample size was calculated using PEMS 3.1 for Windows software (Sichuan University, Chengdu). The length of in-hospital stay was considered to be one of the most importantfactors in the calculation of sample size. The standarddeviation (SD) of the length of in-hospital stay for theconventional treatment group was 6 days [ 13], and it was considered clinically signicant when the length of in-hospital stay was reduced by 4 days. If =0.05, power =0.90, and=0.10, the estimated total sample size is 256 patients. Taking into account a 15% dropout rate, the total sample size is 294 patients. In the study protocol, the planned sample size was 240 consecutive patients who were enrolled into theintervention groups after pathway implementation. Therewere 450 consecutive patients, admitted to the eight hospitalsbetween 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2009, prior to CPimplementation, who were included as a historical controlgroup. The Guangdong Provincial Hospital of TCM plannedto enroll 100 patients for the intervention group and 100patients for the control group. Additionally, each of the other7 hospitals planned to enroll 20 patients for the interventiongroup and 50 patients for the control group. 2.3. Intervention. The patients in the historical control group received conventional management determined by a physi-cian, which included Western medicine and nonstandardizedTCM therapy. The patients in the intervention group weretreated according to the standardized management plan asdetermined by the CPs. The Western medical treatmentconsisted of reperfusion therapy and aspirin, lowmolecular weight and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (or angiotensin IIreceptor blocker), according to the 2007 updated guidelinesEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 CPs based on integrative medicine for AMI CP education and training Intervention group Historical group Length of hospital stay Variability management Medical expenditure MACE Statistical analysis Optimized management of integrative medicine for AMIOptimization of CPsAMI,24 h, age between 18 and 80 years Figure 1: Evaluation of clinical pathways based on integrative medicine for AMI.

For Qi deciency and blood stasis, the standard TCM technique performed in the intervention group was 30 mLAstragalus injection (Astragalus, Zhengda Qingchunbaopharmaceutical company) mixed with 250 mL 5% glucose,which was infused intravenously once per day, and 10 parti- cles of compound Danshen dripping pills (Salvia, Pseudo- ginseng, Borneol, Tasly Group) Banxia 15 administered to patients with cold-phlegm syndrome,Wen Dan Tang (Poria 15 g, Dried tangerine peel 10 g,Pinellia 15 g, Caulis bambusae in taenia 15 g, Fructus aurantii15 g) was administered for patients with heat-phlegm syn-drome, 30 mL Shen Mai injection (Ginseng, Radix, ZhengdaQingchunbao pharmaceutical company) mixed with 5% glu-cose injection infusion was administered for Yin-deciency,and 30 mL Shenfu (tuber, red ginseng, Sanjiu Y a pharma-ceutical company) in 5% glucose intravenous infusion wasadministered for Y ang-deciency. All the treatments wereadministered for 1 week. 2.4. Outcome Measures. The primary outcome was the length of the in-hospital stay. Discharge standard, for patients to bedischarged from the hospital with stable life signs (hemo-dynamic, electrocardiogram, and cardiac function) andwithout the symptoms of myocardial infarction\" (2009 version) by the Med-ical Administration of the Ministry of Health [ 15]. The secondary outcome was the major cardiovascular events(MACE) and economic evaluation during the period of hos- pitalization. MACE is dened as death, or target vessel revasculariza-tion. T otal medical costs include treatment costs, operationcosts, drug costs, nursing costs, inspection fees, and bedcharges. All data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0 (IBMCorporation, Armonk). Measurement data were presented as mean \u00b1ST. Count data were presented as the frequency and constituent ratio, and analyzed using the chi-square testor the exact test exact probability method. For measurementdata, two samples were compared using the Mann-WhitneyUtest. The statistical tests used were two-sided tests, and P<0.05 was considered a statistically signicant di erence. 3. Results Between 1 January 2010 and 31 October 2010, a total of 250 consecutive patients fullling the inclusion criteria wereinitially evaluated as the intervention group, and 53 patientswere excluded because of severe mechanical complicationsor severe liver failure and renal failure. A total of 450 patientsadmitted to eight hospitals from 1 January 2008 to 31December 2009 were screened for the historical controlgroup, and 45 patients were excluded because of severemechanical complications or concomitant diseases. As a result, there were 197 patients enrolled into the intervention group and 405 patients enrolled into the historical controlgroup. 3.1.

The Average Length of In-Hospital Stay. The length of in- hospital stay showed a skewed distribution in both groups,and therefore a nonparametric test was used. The averagelength of stay in the treatment group was 3.5 days less thanthat of the control group, which was statistically signicant(P<0.01;Table 4 ). 3.4. The Total In-Hospital Costs. The average hospitalization costs had a skewed distribution in both groups, so a nonpara-metric test was used. In the intervention group, the averagetotal in-hospital charges were /Yen48047.3 when it was adjusted by the price index, which reduced to /Yen4820.00 compared with the control group. There were statistically signicantdierences between intervention groups and control groups. (P<0.01;Table 5 ). 3.5. The Incidence of Major Cardiovascular Events (MACEs). The major adverse events of death, nonfatal myocardialreinfarction, stent thrombosis, and target vessel revascular-ization (TVR) occurred in 2.5% of patients (5 of 197) inthe interventional group and in 6.9% (28 of 405) of those inthe control group during hospitalization ( P =0.03;Table 6 ). Three patients in the intervention group died due to cardiacshock, and 22 patients died in the historical control groupdue to cardiac shock (10 patients), severe heart failure (4patients), ventricular brillation (5 patients), and multipleorgan dysfunction syndrome (3 patients). The majority ofMACE incidents were death during hospitalization (1.5% versus 5.4%, P =0.03). There was 6 ). 4. Discussion The number of patients in China who develop and present to hospitals with acute coronary syndrome will increase inthe near future. China's fee-for-service payment system hasresulted in a rapid cost increase, ine ciencies, poor quality, unaordable health care, and an erosion of medical ethics [16], and improvement of patient management, together with health system reform, is urgently required. CPs aremanagement plans that specify goals for patients and providethe sequence and timing of the actions necessary to achievethese goals with optimal e ciency. Several areas for improv- ing patient care using CPs have been identied, includingincreasing the use of guideline-recommended medications, reducing variation in care, targeting the use of cardiac procedures, and reducing the length of the hospital stay [ 17]. Therefore, the Ministry of Health in China has encouragedthe implementation of CPs in cardiovascular disease tocontrol medical cost and to improve healthcare quality. T o standardize the AMI treatment-based integrative medicine in TCM hospitals, we conducted this study andevaluated the e cacy of CPs in eight TCM hospitals. In our study, there were more patients with hyperlipidemiaor who were current smokers, and fewer patients with afamily history of coronary disease in the intervention groupthan in the historical control group. These data indicatethat, with diet and life-style changes in China, smoking andhyperlipidemia have emerged as key risk factors leading toAMI, especially for younger people. 4.1. Length of in-Hospital Stay. A previous epidemiological study showed that the average length of hospital stay wasfrom 11.6 to 13.7 days in China for the patients with AMIwho were admitted to hospital within 12 h after onset ofchest pain [ 13]. Our trial indicated that the average length of stay in the treatment group (after implementation ofCPs) was 3.5 days less than the control group (9 .2 \u00b14.2 days versus 12 .7\u00b18.6d a y s ,P< 0.01). The length of the hospital stay after AMI depends on many factors, includingdepartment policies, insurance coverage, age, and patients' complications. However, the length of the hospital stay depended more on the damaged myocardium duration ofrecovery because there were few changes in the medicalpolicy and insurance coverage from 2008 to 2010, and thereare no statistical di erences in age, cardiac function, and other clinical characteristics between the interventional andhistorical groups. In this study, we consistently followed thehospital discharge standards, which ensured that the patientswould be discharged from hospitals in a stable condition.Therefore, the reduction in the length of stay observedin this study is attributed to the potential improvementof healthcare quality and the decreased variation in careconferred by the use of CPs.6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 5: In-hospital medical costs.

Total In-Hospital Medical Costs. China's current strategy to improve payment for health services has made somepositive changes; however, the rapid increase in health expen-diture and inappropriate treatment concerning individuals and governments resulting from China's fee-for-service payment and a price schedule that overpays for drugs andhigh-technological diagnostics tests has led providers tooverprescribe drugs and diagnostic tests [ 18]. Control of the high out-of-pocket healthcare payments when patients haveinadequate insurance coverage in many parts of China is crit-ical. Our study showed that, after the price index adjustment,the total medical expenditure during hospitalization in theintervention group was reduced compared to the historicalcontrol group ( /Yen46365.70 versus /Yen52866.00, respectively, P< 0.01). This suggested that the CPs based on integrative medicine could decrease the cost of hospitalization througha reduction in the length of a patient's in-hospital stay and inthe potential overprescription of drugs and diagnostic tests. 4.3. Health Providers' Compliance with the Guideline. Despite strong evidence for the benets of AMI patient managementusing antiplatelet agents, LMWH and lipid-lowering thera-pies, reports from the CPACS study indicated that physician compliance with guideline recommendations and sustained use of medical therapy remains suboptimal [ 19]. Statins and LMWH are e ective in reducing mortality and serious coronary events in patients with AMI. Despite the increasedusage rate of these therapies in TCM hospitals, data hasshown a lower prescribing rate in TCM hospitals than inWestern Medicine hospitals [ 20]. Our results demonstrate that the use rates of LMWH (100% versus 89%) or statinlipid-lowering drugs (100% versus 96%) in the interventiongroup was higher than in the historical control group, respec-tively, which revealed that CPs have the potential capacityto improve health providers' adherence to published AMIguidelines and to close the gap between the practice and theguideline. However, the prescribing frequency of receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors were not as high as expected inthe intervention group (81% and 82%, resp.). These to data from CPACS hasconsistently demonstrated that receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors are not being used as often or as long as theyshould be, which reflects the physicians' fears that these drugsmay lead to dynamitic deterioration in patients with cardiacshock, acute heart failure, or low blood pressure [ 19]. 4.4. Management of TCM after Reperfusion Therapy. TCM plays an important role in the current treatment of AMIespecially in TCM hospitals. In the past 10 years, blood-activating had emerged as a main TCM method for treatingpatients with AMI, thus leading to wide prescribing ofChinese medicine intravenous preparations that are clinical blood-activating agents [ 5]. As a result, there is more usage of blood-activating intravenous agents in the historical group(63%), as shown in Table 3 . However, in our previous study that related the distribution and evolvement of syndromeelements during the perireperfusion period, we found thatreperfusion treatments play a vital role in activating circula-tion in the TCM theory, and that Qi deciency and bloodstasis are the main syndromes after reperfusion therapy[11]. An analysis of 5284 patients with coronary artery disease indicated that the top two TCM patterns were bloodstasis (79.3%) and Qi deciency (56.5%) [ 21]. Therefore, Qibenetting and blood activating should become the mainTCM treatment, replacing blood-activating alone. In thisstudy, Qi-benetting intravenous agents (e.g., Astragalus,Shen Mai injection and Shenfu injection) and compoundDanshen dripping pills were used as the standardized TCMmanagement after reperfusion. Thus, it is reasonable thatthe rate of use of these agents in intervention group arehigher than in the historical group ( P< 0.01). Other trials indicated that Astragalus injection was e ective in reversing left ventricular remodeling and improving left ventricularfunction in patients with AMI [ 22], and that Salvia miltior- rhiza extract (the main ingredients of compound Danshendripping pills) a ords protection against isoproterenol- induced myocardial infarction [ 23], which demonstrated the possible mechanism of accelerating cardiac function recoveryusing Qi-benetting and blood-activating compounds. Also,CPs application based on integrative medicine guarantees anincrease in the standardized usage of TCM therapy (97%versus 84%). 4.5. Major Adverse Cardiac Events. Despite wide implemen- tation of CPs in cardiovascular disease, no controlled studyhas shown that CPs could reduce the incidence of the deathEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7 or MACE in patients with AMI. Our research indicated that, compared with the historical group, the incidence ofdeath and MACE during hospitalization was lower in theintervention group compared to the control group (1.5%versus 5.4%, 2.5% versus 6.9%, resp., P<0.05). The reasons for this encouraging outcome are complex. Multiple factors including an increase in prescribing drugs, recommended by AMI guidelines, standardized use of TCM based onQi-benetting and blood-activating, and a decrease in thevariation in care attributed to an improvement in healthcare. 5. Conclusions Integrative medicine treatment, combining TCM and con-ventional medicine, has been the most representative char-acteristic for patients with coronary heart disease in China,especially those in TCM hospitals. We found that, in the cur-rent era of published treatment guidelines, implementationof the CPs based on the standardized therapies of integrativemedicine could further improve guideline compliance andoverall quality of care by reducing the length of stay andmedical cost for patients with AMI in Chinese hospitals. 6. Limitations of This Study Although our study revealed the potential improvements in patient outcome by the development and implementation of CPs for AMI patients in China, there are several limitationsof the study. First, the duration of the study period was shortbecause of budget limitations, which leaves uncertainty in thelong-term outcome of patients with AMI. Second, this studyused a nonrandomized retrospective trial design, which maynot fully reflect the improvement of CPs on the quality ofhealth care due to potential changes in insurance coverage orpolicy. Therefore, multicenter large-scale randomized studiesare needed to assess prospectively di erential e ects of CPs based on integrative medicine versus CPs only based onwestern medicine.
