Below is a list of current vaccine clinical trials for the coronavirus at Emory. Many of the trials were organized through the Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Consortium (IDCRC), based at Emory and chaired by David Stephens, MD, vice chair of research for the Woodruff Health Sciences Center and chair of Emory's Department of Medicine. The consortium is supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and includes infectious diseases leaders and clinical researchers from Emory University, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Medical Center and University of Cincinnati, FHI360, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Johns Hopkins University, Kaiser Health Care, New York University, Saint Louis University, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of Rochester, University of Washington, and NIAID. At Emory, several of the studies were conducted by the Hope Clinic of Emory Vaccine Center, which was established in 2002 in downtown Decatur, GA and in 2013 moved to a larger laboratory and clinical space near Emory Decatur Hospital. The Hope Clinic conducts human research studies of public health importance, including research on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, Clostridium difficile,Staphylococcus aureus, seasonal and pandemic influenza, norovirus, Zika, human papilloma virus and Ebola. Research support for the Hope Clinic comes from the federal government, biomedical industry, the Georgia Research Alliance, university resources and philanthropic contributions. - Investigators: Nadine Rouphael, Evan Anderson - Initial test of safety, tolerability and immune response of mRNA vaccine - Emory and Seattle only sites in country.
