This project, the second of three total projects will repair and modify Buildings B, C, E, H, I, and J stairs for code and safety requirements. PROJECT RATIONALE : The Student Residence Center stairs were part of the 2020 structural assessment performed by Heatly Engineering. In the report, building stairs were identified as being very deteriorated and in need of immediate attention for repair or replacement . As construction costs are volatile and project funding is limited, the work will be executed as three separate projects . The stairs of buildings B, C, E, H, I, and J are the second phase. If this project is not approved, the stairs will continue to deteriorate and cause a safety concern for students that reside in these dorms. FUNDING: The total estimated Project Budget is $1,066,851: $1,066,851 is funded from Resident L ife & Student Housing plant fund The University of New Mexico - Albuquerque: Central Campus1 of 11 STUDENT RESIDENCE CENTER STAIR RESTORATION - PHASE II STUDENT RESIDENCE CENTER STAIR RESTORATION -PHASE II2 of 11 NOT IN PHASE II NOT IN PHASE II STUDENT RESIDENCE CENTER STAIR RESTORATION -PHASE II PHASE I PHASE II PHASE III8 of 11 STUDENT RESIDENCE CENTER STAIR RESTORATION -PHASE II11 of 11 STUDENT RESIDENCE CENTER STAIR RESTORATION -PHASE IIREQUEST FOR CAPITAL PROJECT CONSTRUCTION APPROVAL for CLINICAL TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE CENTER ROOF REPLACEMENT UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO February 8th, 2022 REQUESTED ACTION: In accordance with Section 7.12 of the Board of Regents Policy Manual and as required by the New Mexico Higher Education Department and New Mexico State Board of Finance, project approval is requested for Clinical Translational Science Center (CTSC) Roof Replacement , North Campus, Albuquerque, New Mexico. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project includes the removal and replacement of the entire roof 12,314 SF (square foot) of the facility which is 109,553 GSF (gross square feet) in total. The building is located at 900 Camino De Salud N.E. Albuquerque, New Mexico. The existing and curren tly leaking roof system will be completely removed and disposed of. The new roof system will meet the thermal resistance and slope requirements by code (R -30 insulation) and minimum \u00bd\" per foot slope). The new white roof membrane will be an adhered 80-millimeter thick single ply and carries a 20 year no dollar limit warranty. Remediation of the entire roof system has been added to the scope. PROJECT RATIONALE : The Clinical Translational Science Center serves translational science locally, regionally an d nationally; foster scientific and operational innovation to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical translational research; and create, provide and disseminate domain - specific translational science training and workforce development. Our vision for the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Clinical and Translational Science Center is to catalyze scientific discovery into improved health by enabling high quality clinical and translational research locally, regionally and nationally. The existing roof has exceeded its life expectancy which now is consistently leaking and causing damages to the interior of the building. The roof has been repaired fifteen times over the last five years . If the facility is not properly maintained , and the roof is not replaced, user groups will experience impacts to their ability to perform. If the project is not approved, the building will continue to leak causing extensive interior damage which will only escalate as the roof continues to age. This request is for reapproval, as additional funds over the 10% threshold were added to the project for the purpose of abatement.

PROJECT RATIONALE : The Student Union Building ( SUB) serves as a campus community center offering many programs and services to the University community as well as the greater Albuquerque area. The Student Union sees over 10,000 people every day within the walls of its facility. The facility provides meeting and event venues for student groups, communication forums of elected student government and various speaking events that our student population are passionate about. We offer space for student groups to meet, individual study areas and student-sponsored events. The SUB is a leader on campus and provides many high- tech conveniences, essential services, and cultural enrichments to the students and UNM community. If this project is not approved, our facility, UNM students, the community, faculty and staff will be impacted by less than adequate facilities for the programs and services we offer. Our event staff market our facility as a premier venue to promote UNM for conferences and events. If our facility is not properly maintained, it impacts o ur ability to market UNM as a premier venue for events and makes us less competitive with other venues in the Albuquerque area. FUNDING: The total estimated Project Budget is $460,144.00: $300,000 is funded by Student Union Department funds $160,144 is funded by FY22 Building Re placement and Renewal The University of New Mexico - Albuquerque: Central CampusXY XYXYXY BLDG.

TAB 10 #10 Memo To: Teresa Costantinidis, UNM Senior Vice President for Finance and Administration From: Kelly S. Ward, Director of Business Development Lobo Development Corporation Date: January 18, 2022 Re: Project Development Proposal and Agreement, UNM Owned Land at Central Ave. and University Blvd. Lobo Development Corporation is seeking approval of the attached Project Development Proposal and Agreement. The Lobo Development Board of Directors approved the agreement on December 9, 2021 . The proposed development site is approximately 3. 8 acres located on the northwest corner of Central and University and is envisioned as a mixed- used zone that will provide a range of retail, office, and housing. It currently houses the UNM Center for Advanced Research Computing (CARC), several UNM College of Fine Arts Programs , and storage rooms for UNM Facilities Management. The 2009 UNM Master Plan identified the site for commercial development. This has since been reaffirmed through various planning documents and with the recent adoption of the South Campus Tax Increment Development District (TIDD) which extended north to include this site. The University and Lobo Development Corporation have been in preliminary discussions with the City of Albuquerque and Bernalillo County regarding future development on the site. There is a desire to utilize the site for a mixed- use commercial and residential housing development. The residential components would be oriented toward the workforce housing market to take advantage of the transportation, employment, local incentive (funding) programs and redevelopment in the area. Discussions have been at a concept level and issues related to site control, development approvals, deal structure, and long- term financial benefits have yet to be detailed. At this stage, Lobo Development Corporation would like to formally engage with the City of Albuquerque on behalf of the Regents and start taking steps to prepare the site by demolishing a vacant building at the corner of University and Central (PATS Building). Any proposed development and corresponding deal structure will be presented to the Lobo Development Corporation Board and the UNM Regents for approval. 1 PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL AND AGREEMENT Real Estate Development and Management of Regent -Owned Land Effective ___________, 2022 (the \"Effective Date\"), THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO and LOBO DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (each a \"Party\" and together the \"Parties\") agree as follows: 1.

The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. 2 Opinions In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UNM Rainforest Innovations as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Other Matters Required Supplementary Information Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's discussion and analysis on pages 3 through 5 be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report dated September 10, 2021 on our consideration of UNM Rainforest Innovations' internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of UNM Rainforest Innovations' internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering UNM Rainforest Innovations' internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

The increase from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021 was primarily attributable to several fully-paid license agreements entered into during 2021. Current liabilities increased by $4,240,394 as of June 30, 2021 to $7,819,778 compared to $3,579,384 as of June 30, 2020; and increased by $1,659,930 as of June 30, 2020 to $3,579,384 compared to $1,919,454 as of June 30, 2019. The change from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021 is primarily attributable to the increase in the liability due to UNM as of June 30, 2021 associated with several fully-paid license agreements entered into during the year. Capital Assets Capital asset purchases during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $12,373, $7,850, and $12,662, respectively, for buildings, software, leasehold improvements, computer equipment, and furniture and had depreciation expense of $9,596, $8,011, and $8,065, respectively. Comparison of Fiscal 2021 to Fiscal 2020 Results of Operations Total operating revenues increased by $1,392,520 from $56,375,187 in fiscal year 2020 to $57,767,707 for fiscal year 2021. The majority of the increase is primarily attributable to new fully-paid license agreements executed in fiscal year 2021. Total operating expenses increased by $2,293,365 for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to legal expenses incurred related to new fully-paid settlement license agreements entered into during fiscal year 2021. Comparison of Fiscal 2020 to Fiscal 2019 Results of Operations Total operating revenues increased by $51,933,260 from $4,441,927 in fiscal year 2019 to $56,375,187 for fiscal year 2020. The majority of the increase is directly attributable to several fully-paid license agreements and a patent monetization agreement. This was offset by a decrease in patent cost reimbursement in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019. Additionally, other revenues increased by $59,682 in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 primarily due new events and programs and increases in registration of existing events offered during 2020. Total operating expenses increased by $45,401,241 for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019. The increase was primarily attributable with the associated fees and distributions related to the fully-paid license agreements of $33,835,952, the foreign taxes associated with the fully-paid license agreements of $9,197,500, incentive compensation associated with the positive results incurred during the year of $1,794,304, and the patent monetization distributions of $760,000 in fiscal year 2020.

UNM RAINFOREST INNOVATIONS (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements Year Ended June 30, 2021 9 (1) Organization UNM Rainforest Innovations (the Corporation) is a blended component unit of The University of New Mexico (UNM). The Corporation was organized on April 26, 1993 to facilitate the commercialization of UNM faculty inventions and to manage UNM's Science & Technology Park in Albuquerque, New Mexico. On December 14, 2004, UNM and UNM Rainforest Innovations entered into a revised Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) containing the expectations and performance obligations UNM is seeking from the Corporation. The MOA may be terminated at any time by either party, at which point all property of the Corporation shall be transferred to UNM or other successor organization designated by resolution of the UNM Board of Regents. The Corporation was incorporated under the State of New Mexico's University Research Park and Economic Development Act. As of June 30, 2021, the governing board consisted of 29 members, including 11 members of certain officers and faculty of UNM, the President of the Corporation, and 17 members of the community. The Corporation has no component units. (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation As a blended component unit of UNM, the Corporation prepared its financial statements in accordance with the accounting disclosure requirements under the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) pronouncements as the Corporation meets the criteria of a governmental not-for-profit. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The significant accounting policies are summarized below. The Corporation's financial statements are reported using the flow of economic resources measurement focus and the full accrual basis of accounting. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when earned and expenses are recognized as soon as the liability is incurred. Operating revenues and expenses are those incurred that primarily relate directly to facilitating commercialization of UNM faculty, staff, and student inventions, as well as economic development initiatives and venture development income. All other revenues and expenses are considered nonoperating. (b) Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts and disclosures during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. UNM RAINFOREST INNOVATIONS (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 10 (c) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include deposits and funds invested in short-term money market mutual funds. The Corporation is not subject to statutory or policy restrictions on the types of deposits held. For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Corporation considers all cash on hand, cash in banks, and all highly liquid securities with original maturities less than 90 days to be cash equivalents. (d) Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable represent the amount earned based on existing terms under license agreements but uncollected on accrued royalties earned from customers. Accounts receivable are carried at original amount billed less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts. Accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible. During fiscal 2021 and 2020, management wrote-off $103,324 and $425,000, respectively, deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received. There were no recoveries in fiscal years 2021 or 2020. There was an allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,198 and $100,000 as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. An account receivable is considered to be past due if any portion of the receivable balance is outstanding for more than 90 days. Interest is not charged on past due accounts receivable. (e) Capital Assets Capital assets are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of three to seven years, except for depreciation of buildings, which have a useful life of 30 years. Capital assets costing over $1,000 and with a useful life greater than a year are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance expenses are charged to expense as incurred. (f) Patent Costs UNM, a related party, provides annual funding for patent costs. The funding revenue is deferred on receipt. As patent costs are incurred, expense is recognized and an equal amount of the deferred revenue is recognized as income. UNM RAINFOREST INNOVATIONS (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements Year Ended June 30, 2021 11 (g) Revenue Recognition Upfront, nonrefundable licensing fees are recognized when earned. These fees are ordinarily earned when a license agreement is signed and the Corporation has no further obligations with respect to the license. Minimum annual royalty and license maintenance fee income is accrued as it is earned, if it is determined that collection is reasonably assured. Operational and patent cost funding from UNM is recognized when all eligibility requirements have been met. Patent cost reimbursement is recognized when earned. Economic development funding and other professional service income is on a cost- reimbursement basis and thus revenue is recognized equal to the amount of allowable expenses incurred. Patent monetization fees are recognized when an agreement is signed and the Corporation has no further obligations with respect to the agreement. Rental income from operating leases is recognized on a month-to-month basis according to lease terms. Accounts receivable, net was $754,737 and $405,843 as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had bad debt expense related to royalties and licenses of $98,849 and $504,698, respectively. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had $4,475 and $20,302 of bad debt expense related to patent cost reimbursement, respectively. The Corporation netted bad debt expense with the corresponding revenue. (h) Income Taxes The Corporation has received a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that it is an organization described in Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3). As such, it would be exempt from federal income tax on income generated from activities related to its exempt function. The Corporation is taxable on unrelated business taxable income. Under some license agreements, the Corporation will take an equity position in the licensee. If the licensee is a limited liability company, the IRS treats income allocable to interests held by a tax-exempt entity as unrelated business taxable income. The Corporation had no unrelated business taxable income during the years ended June 30, 2021 or 2020. (i) Accrued Employee Benefits The Corporation's employees may accumulate paid personal time, which is payable to the employee upon termination or retirement. Personal time costs are recognized as a liability when earned by the employee. UNM RAINFOREST INNOVATIONS (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements Year Ended June 30, 2021 12 (j) Investments The investment portfolio is valued based on quoted market values. The portfolio primarily consists of mutual funds. Investments in stock consist of ownership interest in start-up companies and are carried at cost basis. (k) Net Position Net position is classified as follows: Invested in capital assets (net of related debt) is intended to reflect the portion of net position that is associated with non-liquid, capital assets less outstanding capital asset-related debt. The Corporation does not have any debt related to its capital assets. Restricted net position is the net position that has third-party (statutory or granting agency) limitations on its use. There was no restricted net position as of June 30, 2021 and 2020. Unrestricted net position represents liquid assets available for use. (l) Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards GASB Statement No. 95 - Postponement of the Effective Dates of Certain Authoritative Guidance. This statement extends the implementation dates of several existing GASB authoritative guidance, including GASB No. 87 to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2021. GASB Statement No. 87 - Leases. This statement defines a lease as a contract that conveys control of the right to use another entity's nonfinancial asset (e.g., buildings, land, vehicles, equipment) as specified in the contract for a period of time in an exchange or exchange-like transaction. This statement requires recognition of certain lease assets and liabilities for leases that previously were classified as operating leases and recognized as inflows of resources (revenues) or outflows of resources (expenses) based on the payment provisions of the contract. A lessee is required to recognize a lease liability, measured at the present value of payments expected to be made during the lease term, and an intangible right-to-use lease asset, measured at the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement of the lease term and certain direct costs. A lessor is required to recognize a lease receivable, measured at the present value of lease payments expected to be received during the lease term, and a deferred inflow of resources, measured at the value of the lease receivable plus any payments received at or before the commencement of the lease term that relate to future periods. This statement includes an exception for short-term leases (those with a maximum possible term of 12 months or less), contracts that transfer ownership, leases of assets that are investments, and certain regulated leases. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact GASB Statement No. 87 will have on its financial statements. UNM RAINFOREST INNOVATIONS (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 13 (3) License Agreements During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the Corporation entered into several fully-paid license agreements. The fully-paid license agreements grant a non-exclusive, irrevocable, non-transferable, world-wide license under the licensed patents. Th e Company incurred $45 ,131,032 and $33,835,952 in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, in associated fees and distributions included in general and administrative and licensing distributions on the statement of revenues, expense, and changes in net position. Net licensing revenues are subject to distributions, based on mutual agreements and UNM policy, to joint owners of intellectual property, UNM inventors, and certain offices at UNM. As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, $4,425 ,383 and $427,185, respectively, are owed to UNM for UNM's share of licensing distributions. (4) Patent Monetization Agreement On July 12, 2019, the Corporation entered into a Patent Monetization Agreement and related documents with multiple third-parties to fund expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Corporation in pursuing certain patent infringement claims. The terms of the agreements are subject to confidentiality provisions and/or Attorney-Client Privilege. During fiscal year 2021, certain patent settlement claims resulted in three fully-paid license agreements. (5) Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents: Cash on deposit at financial institution $ 8,840,547 6,824,692 Cash equivalents not considered deposits: Money market accounts 307,569 39,397 Petty cash 100 100 Total cash and cash equivalents $ 9,148,216 6,864,189 Investments: Mutual funds: Domestic fixed income $ fixed income 60,646 Domestic equity $ 12,646,362 3,897,683 UNM RAINFOREST INNOVATIONS (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements Year Ended June 30, 2021 15 (a) Custodial Credit Risk Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a financial institution failure, the entity's deposits may not be returned to it. The Corporation maintains cash and cash equivalents in interest-bearing transaction accounts with financial institutions and, as such, the accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) up to $250,000. The Corporation does not believe there is any significant credit risk related to their deposits. The Corporation does not require collateral on its cash deposits in excess of $250,000. As of June 30, the Corporation's deposits were exposed to custodial credit risk as follows: The following schedule details the Corporation's deposit accounts at June 30, 2021: Financial Bank Name/ Account Statement Outstandin g Bank Account T ype Balance Checks Balance Bank of the West: Operating Checking $ 8,840,547 213,911 $ 9,054,458 TIAA: Money market account Money market 307,569 - 307,569 9,362,027 Less FDIC insurance (250,000) Less SIPC insurance (250,000) Uninsured and uncollateralized at June 30, 2021 $ 8,862,027 The following schedule details the Corporation's deposit accounts at June 30, 2020: Financial Bank Name/ Account Statement Outstandin g Bank Account T ype Balance Checks Balance Bank of the West: Operating Checking $ 6,824,692 251,255 $ 7,075,947 TIAA: Money market account Money market 39,397 - 39,397 7,115,344 Less FDIC insurance (250,000) Less SIPC insurance (39,397) Uninsured and uncollateralized at June 30, 2020 $ 6,825,947 UNM RAINFOREST INNOVATIONS (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements Years Ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 16 (b) Investment Policy Up until March 2020, the Corporation had its funds in the \"Aggressive\" investment objective option under the \"Passive Meet/Beat Market\" TIAA Portfolio Advisor Investment Strategy. Due to negative long-term forecasts in the global market, the Corporation changed its investment objective option to \"Moderate/Intermediate-Term\" under the Passive Meet/Beat Market\" TIAA Portfolio Advisor Investment Strategy. TIAA has a general investment account policy developed for the Corporation's funds. The policy establishes an understanding as to the investment goals, objectives, and management policies for this specific portfolio. The objective of the fund is an emphasis on the total return of the portfolio with some consideration on additional customization options. Investments are primarily in equity securities and other asset classes, with growth as the primary objective. Fixed income securities are utilized for risk control. Real assets are utilized for diversification and complementary strategies may be utilized to improve the return/risk relationship of the portfolio. The risk of tolerance of the Corporation can currently be described as \"moderate/intermediate-term\". The performance of the portfolio will be monitored, measured, and reported by TIAA to the Corporation. On July 31, 2020, the Corporation's Board of Directors approved a Quasi-Endowment Fund Investment Policy establishing investment objectives, policies, guidelines, and eligible securities for the investment and management of funds held in the Quasi-Endowment Fund. The amended investment policy eliminated the concept of and use of a Strategic Initiatives Fund and authorized the creation of a Spending Account, as described in the policy, for the determination of the amount of funds available for expenditure on the Corporation's strategic initiatives. (c) Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Credit risk is the risk that the credit quality of investments fluctuates or downgrades from the time of purchase or the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligations. The Corporation's investments subject to interest rate and credit risk are the fixed income mutual funds. The Corporation's investment policy limits interest rate risk by limiting the percentage of assets invested in bond funds and by requiring the weighted average duration of its portfolio of bond funds to not exceed the duration of the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index by more than two years. The Corporation's investment policy limits credit risk by requiring that domestic investment grade bond funds held have a credit rating of BBB or above at purchase, and by limiting the percentage of assets invested in bond funds.

All foreign investments of the Corporation are in mutual funds, as disclosed elsewhere in this note. (e) Net Increase in Fair Value of Investments During the years ended June 30, the Corporation experienced realized gains and unrealized losses on investments held as follows: 2021 2020 Realized gains $ 70,133 26,135 Unrealized gains 1,440,332 186,995 Net increase in fair value of investments $ 1,510,465 213,130 Fair Value Measurement The Corporation categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting principles. The hierarchy is based on the valuation inputs used to measure the fair value of the asset. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets in active markets, accessible at the measurement date. Level 1 inputs include exchange markets, dealer markets, brokered markets, and principal-to-principal markets. Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for an asset, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for an asset. Investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value are recorded using net asset value (NAV). NAV is generally provided by the investment managers, but the Corporation considers the reasonableness of the NAV, based on market information, to arrive at the fair value estimates for each investment. UNM RAINFOREST INNOVATIONS (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements Year Ended June 30, 2021 19 The Corporation has the following recurring fair value measurements as of June 30, 2021: Quoted Prices in Active Si gnificant Markets Other Si gnificant for Identical Observable Unobservable Assets In puts In puts Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Investments: Mutual funds: Domestic fixed income $ 3,206,189 3,206,189 \u2014 \u2014 International fixed income 120,220 120,220 \u2014 \u2014 Domestic equity 5,867,004 5, 867,004 \u2014 \u2014 International equity 3,452,949 3,452,949 \u2014 \u2014 Total investments $12,646,362 12,646,362 \u2014 \u2014 The Corporation has the following recurring fair value measurements as of June 30, 2020: Quoted Prices in Active Si gnificant Markets Other Si gnificant for Identical Observable Unobservable Assets In puts In puts Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Investments: Mutual funds: Domestic fixed income $ 1,730,910 1,730,910 \u2014 \u2014 International fixed income 60,646 60,646 Domestic equity 1,356,556 1,356,556 \u2014 \u2014 International equity 749,571 749,571 \u2014 \u2014 Total investments $ 3,897,683 3,897,683 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 UNM RAINFOREST INNOVATIONS (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements Year Ended June 30, 2021 20 (6) Capital Assets The Corporation has the following capital assets as of June 30: 2021 Beginnin g Endin g Balance Increases Decreases Balance depreciated: Furniture and 2020 Beginnin g Endin g Balance Increases Decreases Balance Capital assets being depreciated: Furniture and equipmen t$ assets, ne t$ 33,040 (161) \u2014 32,879 (7) Commitments and Contingencies (a) Occupancy Agreement The Corporation entered into an occupancy agreement with UNM for lease of the office facilities, effective August 15, 2017, as amended on February 28, 2021, with an end date of August 31, 2027. Future minimum payments required under the occupancy agreements are as follows: Year ending June 30, 2022 $ 146,919 Year ending June 30, 2023 146,919 Year ending June 30, 2024 146,919 Year ending June 30, 2025 159,253 Year ending June 30, 2026 161,719 Thereafter 188,673 $ 950,402 Rent expense in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was $204,528 and $233,332, respectively, which are included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position. The Corporation entered into sublease agreement with a third party effective September 1, 2017; however, the sublease was terminated on February 28, 2021. Previously the minimum receipts required under the sublease were $86,403 each fiscal year. During the year, due to the Corporation's sublease termination, the Corporation and UNM RAINFOREST INNOVATIONS (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements Year Ended June 30, 2021 21 UNM amended the occupancy agreement as follows: the monthly rent decreased to $12,243 beginning March 1, 2021 through August 31, 2024; and monthly rent will increase to $13,477 beginning September 1, 2024 through lease termination date of August 31, 2027. The Corporation also enters into various short-term monthly agreements with venture lab tenants for virtual and physical space. The Corporation recorded $90,825 and $128,631 of rental/occupancy income associated with these agreements in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. (b) Risk Management The Corporation is exposed to various risks of loss from torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of assets; business interruption; errors and omissions; and natural disasters. The Corporation is insured under the UNM's Risk Management for liability and casualty insurance, and through a private carrier for director and officer liability insurance. There have been no significant reductions in coverage from the prior year and there have been no settlements in any of the past years. (c) Litigation In the normal course of its commercialization activities and the protection of its patent portfolio, the Corporation engages in litigation to enforce its contractual rights under existing license agreements and to enforce its patent rights against infringers. During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the Corporation resolved litigation in several infringement cases. The terms of the agreements related to the resolution of each case are subject to confidentiality restrictions set out in the agreements. (d) Foreign Taxes In the normal course of its commercialization activities, the Corporation may pay taxes to foreign jurisdictions on royalty income. In some cases, the Corporation may be entitled to refunds based upon tax treaties between the U.S. Government and the foreign jurisdiction or other law. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation paid foreign taxes in the amount of $0 and $9,197,500, respectively, and is currently seeking a refund of all or a portion of such amount. The Company has not recorded any gain contingency as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 associated with these taxes. (e) COVID-19 The outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has led to adverse impacts on the U.S. and global economies and created uncertainty regarding potential impacts to the Company's operations and customer demand. The ongoing pandemic has impacted the Corporation's operations and the operations of the Corporation's start-up companies and UNM as a result of quarantines, and travel and logistics restrictions. While there have been disruptions caused by the pandemic, the Corporation has successfully adapted to using various tools and applications to manage operations remotely and to enhance communications. The Corporation has followed UNM RAINFOREST INNOVATIONS (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements Year Ended June 30, 2021 22 UNM's guidance related to the pandemic and has had limited operations with partial opening of the office facilities. All events and meetings were changed to be held online and in some cases the attendance has increased compared to pre-pandemic in-person gatherings. Despite the challenges, the level of licensing and patent activity remained very strong during the current year. With the newly discovered variant of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 having possible further global implications, there is continued uncertainty regarding the pandemic's duration. The Corporation's management expects the continuing pandemic will have a certain level of ongoing impact on its results of operations, financial position, and liquidity; however, management cannot reasonably estimate the future impact at this time. (8) Defined Contribution Plan The Corporation sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan for eligible employees. Employees may contribute up to the maximum allowed by the IRS. In fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the Corporation matched employee contributions below 7.975% commensurately; employee contributions that equaled or exceeded 7.975% were matched up to 12.4% of the employee's base salary. There is no vesting period. The Corporation's contributions were $132,558 and $124,518 in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Employee contributions were $90,282 and $85,001 in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. (9) Incentive Compensation Plan The Corporation has an incentive compensation plan in which the finance and compensation committee of the Corporation's Board of Directors (UNMRI Board) has the discretion to provide a cash and/or equity incentive award based on performance. Cash bonuses awarded to employees were $1,863,650 and $1,790,639 in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Equity incentive awards are provided to eligible employees in shares of start-up company common or preferred stock. The total shares awarded to employees for various companies during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were 5,993 and 79,312, respectively. UNM RAINFOREST INNOVATIONS (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements Year Ended June 30, 2021 23 (10) Quasi-Endowment The Corporation's Board approved, as amended, an internal UNM Rainforest Innovations endowment policy for management of large one-time license-fee related payments received by the Corporation. The endowment policy, as amended, states that if the Corporation's net position balance exceeds $500,000 then the excess balance may be allocated as follows: 80% to the Corporation's Quasi-Endowment, the interest from which could be used to fund the Corporation's operations; and 20% to the Corporation's Strategic Initiatives Fund to be used for the inventor recognition awards program, the gap fund program, and other strategic initiatives of the Corporation, as determined by the Corporation Board's Executive Committee. Reallocation of balances between the Quasi-Endowment, Strategic Initiatives Fund, and other net position balances may be made at the discretion of the Corporation's Finance Committee. The Corporation's Board designated endowment of $500,000 is accounted for and included under unrestricted net position. The Corporation Board's Endowment Committee meets on a quarterly basis to closely monitor the endowment fund activities and investment fund portfolio. (11) Co-Investment Fund Based on a working relationship with the UNM Foundation, a related party, during fiscal year 2014, the UNM RI Board of Directors approved the UNM RI Policy on Investment from Co-Investment Fund. The UNM Foundation revised its Consolidated Investment Fund Policy (the Policy) to set aside $1,000,000 for their investment in private startup companies, which were started based on technology transferred and licensed from the Corporation. Under the Policy, any positive returns realized and received by the Co-Investment Fund in the future shall be shared 10% by the Corporation and 90% by the UNM Foundation. The Policy agreement was amended on October 21, 2016 removing the $1,000,000 threshold. During fiscal year 2021, the Corporation approved two proposals from two separate start-up companies and provided successful co-investments totaling $189,993 based on direct pass-through funding from the UNM Foundation to the Corporation per the terms of the policy. During fiscal year 2020, the Corporation approved one proposal from a start-up company and provided successful co-investments totaling $100,000 based on direct pass-through funding from the UNM Foundation to the Corporation per the terms of the policy. 24 Report of Independent Auditors on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards The Board of Directors UNM Rainforest Innovations and Mr. Brian S. Col\u00f3n, Esq. New Mexico State Auditor We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of UNM Rainforest Innovations, which comprise the statement of net position as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021, and the statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position and cash flow for the year then ended, and have issued our report thereon dated September 10, 2021. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered UNM Rainforest Innovations' internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of UNM Rainforest Innovations' internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of UNM Rainforest Innovations' internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 25 Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether UNM Rainforest Innovations' financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards . Purpose of this Report The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

New Mexico State Auditor Report on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Lobo Energy, Incorporated (Lobo Energy), a blended component unit of the University of New Mexico, which comprise the statements of net position as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise Lobo Energy's basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents. Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audits . We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 3 We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. Opinions In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of Lobo Energy as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the changes in its financial position and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Other Matters Required Supplementary Information Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's discussion and analysis on pages 4 through 6 be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic fina ncial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report dated September 16, 2021 on our consideration of Lobo Energy's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of Lobo Energy's internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering Lobo Energy's internal control over financial reporting and compliance. Albuquerque, New Mexico September 16, 2021 LOBO ENERGY, INCORPORATED (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Management's Discussion and Analysis (unaudited) June 30, 2021 and 2020 4 The following discussion and analysis provides an overview of the financial position and activities of Lobo Energy, Incorporated (Lobo Energy) as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019.

The change in net position for 2021 was due to a decrease in operating expense caused by a slow-down in operations as a result of COVID -19 restrictions and a decrease in nonoperating interest expense. The change in net position for 2020 was due to an increase in operating expenses that were offset by decreases in nonoperating expenses. During fiscal year 2021, Lobo Energy's operating revenue remained the same and operating expenses decreased by $65,439, resulting in a net operating gain of $808,645 in fiscal year 2021, compared to a net operating gain of $743,206 in fiscal year 2020.

The increase during fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to a slow-down in operations as a result of COVID-19 restrictions. Cash increased in fiscal year 2020 by $61,892 resulting in cash on deposit with fiscal agent and cash on hand at the close of fiscal year 2020 of $783,599.

LOBO ENERGY, INCORPORATED (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements June 30, 2021 and 2020 10 (1) Description of Business Lobo Energy, Incorporated (Lobo Energy) (a blended component unit of the University of New Mexico) is owned, controlled, and was established by the University of New Mexico's (UNM) Board of Regents. Lobo Energy was incorporated in the State of New Mexico on July 15, 1998. It was organized under the amended State of New Mexico's University Research Park Act. The name of the Act has since been changed to the University Research Park and Economic Development Act. Lobo Energy was established to provide UNM with services outlined in an Interim Services Agreement (ISA) that included procuring electricity and natural gas for UNM, installing an energy metering and management system, and developing a Master Utility Business Plan (Plan) for the upgrade and improvement of the utility infrastructure. Lobo Energy completed the installation of a metering and monitoring system and developed and integrated energy procurement methods into UNM's procurement processes. Lobo Energy's board of directors approved the Plan in June 2000. UNM implemented the Plan and financed and constructed the projects contemplated in the Plan. In developing the plan, Lobo Energy employed several consultants to assist in assessing the utility infrastructure needs, defining a technical solution, and determining the financial parameters of that solution. The combined efforts resulted in a comprehensive plan that identified many utility improvement projects, their construction costs, and the financial impacts upon the utility services. The utility systems included in the plan were renewed through a series of construction projects over a period of several years. Lobo Energy conducted its business under the terms of a November 2000-2005 Management Services Agreement (MSA) that replaced the original ISA. Under the MSA, with respect to existing and any and all new utility systems and equipment, UNM continued to own, finance, operate, maintain, and in all respects control the utility equipment and systems. Lobo Energy provided project management services and transition management services for the duration of the project. The utility upgrade project was completed during 2006. Lobo Energy currently provides services to UNM under the terms of a revised MSA, which is effective November 2020-2025 (Note 3). The agreement continues for consecutive one-year periods after its expiration or until such time as it is terminated. UNM may terminate the MSA thirty-days after written notice to Lobo Energy. UNM has not notified Lobo Energy that it intends to exercise this right. Upon termination of this agreement all rights and privileges granted, assigned, or shared between Lobo Energy and UNM shall terminate. Upon termination of the agreement, all property of Lobo Energy shall transfer to UNM subject to the prior rights, if any, of any creditors of Lobo Energy. UNM requested that Lobo Energy implement an energy conservation program on the campus during fiscal year 2008. Lobo Energy entered into a contract with Energy Education, Inc. (EEI), a corporation that specializes in energy conservation (EEI is now known as Cenergistic). Lobo Energy hired six energy conservation specialists (ECSs). Contract payments began after the first six months the contract was in effect. The ongoing program continues to be very effective. UNM has experienced a dramatic decrease in its energy consumption, as well as a reduction in the size of its carbon footprint, since the onset of the project. The four-year contract with EEI expired on September 30, 2012. The energy conservation project continues on campus. LOBO ENERGY, INCORPORATED (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements June 30, 2021 and 2020 11 During fiscal years 2008 and 2009, energy-conservation programs were started on UNM's Valencia, Gallup, Los Alamos, and Taos campuses. The program on each of those campuses is administered by an employee who was already employed on each campus. The programs are ongoing during fiscal years 2020 and 2021. During fiscal year 2013, at the request of UNM, Lobo Energy began providing technical support for the smart-grid, renewable-energy project owned by Shimizu NA on the Mesa del Sol campus. Lobo Energy is compensated by Shimizu for its participation in this project. Lobo Energy's contract with Shimizu expired on March 31, 2014. The solar unit was given to UNM's Engineering Department by Shimizu and the maintenance is provided by UNM Physical Plant personnel. (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices (a) Basis of Accounting and Presentation As a proprietary fund, Lobo Energy's financial statements are reported using a flow of economic resources measurement focus and the full accrual basis of accounting. Accordingly, revenues are recognized when they are earned and expenses are recognized as soon as the liability is incurred. Operating revenues and expenses are those incurred that relate directly to energy and project management services. All other revenues and expenses are considered nonoperating. The accompanying financial statements include only the accounts of Lobo Energy, which has no component units. (b) Net Position For accounting and reporting purposes, Lobo Energy reports its net position in the following net asset categories as applicable: Net investment in capital assets - capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and debt incurred to finance the capital asset acquisition. Unrestricted - net position that is not subject to externally imposed constraints. (c) Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statements dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during these reporting periods. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, actual results could differ from those estimates. (d) Cash on Deposit For purposes of the statement of cash, Lobo Energy considers cash to be cash deposits and amounts held by its fiscal agent. LOBO ENERGY, INCORPORATED (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements June 30, 2021 and 2020 12 (e) Revenue Recognition Lobo Energy provides two types of project management services: utilities management services and other management services (see Note 3). Revenue is recognized for each type of service based on the terms of the MSA. (f) Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable balances represent amounts due from an affiliated entity (UNM) for services performed under the MSA. All amounts are considered collectible and therefore no allowance for doubtful accounts has been recorded. (g) Capital Assets Capital assets are stated at cost. Lobo Energy's policy is to capitalize all disbursements for equipment, software, and furnishings in excess of a $5,000 per unit price. Items with a cost of less than $5,000 are expensed in the year of acquisition. Donated equipment is recorded at fair market value at the date of donation. Repairs and maintenance expenses are charged to operations when incurred and major improvements and replacements are capitalized. (h) Compensated Absences Under Lobo Energy's internal policy terminating employees are not entitled to unused sick leave except for amounts unused exceeding a balance of 600 hours. If a terminating employee's balance exceeds 600 hours the employee can request that the amounts in excess of 600 be paid out to the employee upon termination at 50% of their pay rate. Lobo Energy does accrue for annual leave at a maximum of 252 hours per employee, which is payable to each employee upon termination. Lobo Energy recorded $63,985 and $60,624 of annual leave as accrued expenses at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (i) Income Taxes Lobo Energy is exempt from federal income tax on income related to its exempt purposes under Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code. LOBO ENERGY, INCORPORATED (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements June 30, 2021 and 2020 13 (j) Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards GASB Statement 87 - Leases . This Statement defines a lease as a contract that conveys control of the right to use another entity's nonfinancial asset (e.g., buildings, land, vehicles, equipment) as specified in the contract for a period of time in an exchange or exchange-like transaction. This Statement requires recognition of certain lease assets and liabilities for leases that previously were classified as operating leases and recognized as inflows of resources (revenues) or outflows of resources (expenses) based on the payment provisions of the contract. A lessee is required to recognize a lease liability, measured at the present value of payments expected to be made during the lease term, and an intangible right-to-use lease asset, measured at the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement of the lease term and certain direct costs. A lessor is required to recognize a lease receivable, measured at the present value of lease payments expected to be received during the lease term, and a deferred inflow of resources, measured at the value of the lease receivable plus any payments received at or before the commence ment of the lease term that relate to future periods. This Statement includes an exception for short-term leases (those with a maximum possible term of 12 months or less), contracts that transfer ownership, leases of assets that are investments, and certain regulated leases. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, GASB issued Statement 95, which postpones the effective date of GASB Statement 87 by 18 months. Therefore, GASB Statement 87 is effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2021 (fiscal year 2022), and earlier application is encouraged. Lobo Energy is currently evaluating the impact GASB Statement 87 will have on its financial statements. (3) Project Management Services under The Revised Management Services Agreement (a) Utilities Management Services Lobo Energy may provide assistance to UNM, as requested, for the management and supervision of its contracts that provide for the: a. Planning, design, engineering, contracting, energy conservation, and commissioning services for assigned projects. b. Procurement of equipment and services in the course of implementing the projects. c. Management of UNM's energy procurement strategies. d. Recommendations for obtaining cost-effective energy commodities and services from energy suppliers. e. Management of UNM's energy-related regulatory issues. f. Recommendations for appropriate actions and strategies in response to regulatory opportunities or events. g.

LOBO ENERGY, INCORPORATED (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements June 30, 2021 and 2020 14 (b) Other Management Services a. Commercial development planning services. b. Additional infrastructure development plans. c. Other planning services as assigned. Under the revised MSA, as of November 1, 2020, UNM pays Lobo Energy a mutually agreed-upon monthly fee for the duration of each project. Under the terms of the revised MSA, effective November 1, 2020, UNM compensates Lobo Energy for these services at the rate of $40,000 per month related to utility project management and $46,000 per month related to energy conservation projects, over a five-year period. Additionally, UNM compensates Lobo Energy an additional $94,922 per month to cover the debt service related to the second cogeneration unit, until the debt service is fulfilled. (4) Cash Lobo Energy's cash balances include cash on deposit with its fiscal agent and an operating account. Lobo Energy has no statutory or policy requirements; however, it has a policy to deposit funds only in FDIC-insured accounts. UNM serves as the fiscal agent for Lobo Energy through which Lobo Energy participates in a pooled bank account maintained by UNM. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, Lobo Energy had a book and bank balance in that pooled account of $380,239 and $309,075, respectively. As fiscal agent, UNM requires the financial institution holding these pooled funds to maintain minimum collateral amounts. Interest is allocated monthly to Lobo Energy's account based on its balance in the pooled bank account at the end of the preceding month. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, Lobo Energy realized a gain of $5,799 and $6,241, respectively, via year-end adjustments to the interest account by UNM. Custodial Credit Risk - Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the entity's deposits may not be returned to it. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, the bank balance in Lobo Energy's separate checking account was $505,410 and $491,483, respectively, and the book balance was $505,410 and $474,524, respectively. At June 30, 2021 and 2020, the checking account balance was in excess of amounts insured by the FDIC by $255,410 and $241,483, respectively. (5) Capital Assets and Long-Term Debt (a) Co-generation Unit In July 2012, Lobo Energy entered into a $10,000,000 commitment to finance the construction of a new co-generation unit to be installed on the UNM main campus in Ford Utilities Center. The Master Equipment Lease/Purchase Agreement with Banc of America Leasing and Capital, LLC (Banc of America) was entered into and is to be repaid over a period of 10 years. Monthly payments in the amount of $94,922 commenced on August 25, 2012. T he final lease payment is anticipated to be made on July 25, 2022.

As a defined-contribution plan, benefits depend solely on amounts contributed to the plan plus investment earnings. The plan may be amended by a board of directors' resolution. All employees of Lobo Energy are eligible to participate and are considered to be immediately vested. The plan allows for variable employee contributions up to the Internal Revenue Service maximum allowed amount. Lobo Energy contributed a 100% match up to 6% of each participating employee's gross salary per compensation period through April 2020. Effective May 1, 2020, Lobo Energy contributes a 100% of compensation, provided that the participant's elective deferrals do not exceed that percentage of the participant's compensation determined by reference to, and in the same percentage designated as the Employer Rate published by the State of New Mexico Educational Retirement Board. The Employer Rate was 14.15% as published by State of New Mexico Educational Retirement Board. Contributions to the plan for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $117,879 and $72,199, respectively, which consisted of $58,940 and $37,600 contributed by employees and $58,939 and $34,599 contributed by Lobo Energy, respectively.

LOBO ENERGY, INCORPORATED (A Blended Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements June 30, 2021 and 2020 17 (8) Risk Management Lobo Energy, through UNM, participates in the State of New Mexico Risk Management Program (Risk Management) that provides general liability, auto liability, physical damage, and workers' compensation insurance. The Risk Management program liability insurance coverage includes most employee liability claims; those claims falling outside this state program are in limited amounts and are covered by UNM from its operating budget. UNM's exposure is limited to $2,500 per any first party incurred property loss, with the exception of theft, which has a $5,000 deductible. (9) Uncertainty due to COVID-19 Pandemic During 2020, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) occurred in the United States, along with various other countries globally. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization assessed the novel coronavirus outbreak and characterized it as a pandemic. Subsequent to the declaration of a pandemic, a variety of federal, state, and local governments have taken actions in response to the pandemic, which have ranged by jurisdiction, but are resulting in a variety of negative economic consequences, the scope of which are not currently known or quantifiable. The duration and intensity of the impact of the coronavirus and resulting impact to Lobo Energy is unknown. (10) Subsequent Events Subsequent events are evaluated by management through the date the accompanying financial statements are available to be issued, which is September 16, 2021. 18 Report of Independent Auditors on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards The Board of Directors Lobo Ener gy, Incorporated and Mr. Brian S. Col\u00f3n, Esq., New Mexico State Auditor We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of Lobo Energy, Incorporated (Lobo Energy), a blended component unit of the University of New Mexico, which comprise the statement of net position as of June 30, 2021, and the related statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated September 16, 2021. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered Lobo Energy's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Lobo Energy's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Lobo Energy's internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 19 Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether Lobo Energy's financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards . Purpose of this Report The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

Siegel Garnett Stokes, Ph.D. Doug Ziedonis2 Report of Independent Auditors The Board of Directors Lobo Develo pment Corporation and Mr. Brian Col\u00f3n, Esq., New Mexico State Auditor Report on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Lobo Develo pment Corporation (Lobo Development), a component unit of the University of New Mexico, which comprise the statements of the net position as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position and cash flows for the year s then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise Lobo Development's financial statements as listed in the table of contents. Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fa ir presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accept ed in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of inter nal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statem ents based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing sta ndards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance ab out whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor c onsiders internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial st atements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpo se of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used a nd the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluat ing the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.3 Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Lobo Development Corporation as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the changes in its financial position and its cash flows for the years t hen ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Other Matters Required Supplementary Information Accounting principles generally accepted in the Unit ed States of America require that the management's discussion and analysis on pages 4 through 7 be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic fi nancial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who consider s it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supple mentary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic fi nancial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information becaus e the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our report dated September 15, 2021 on our consideration of Lobo Development's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to desc ribe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of Lobo Development's internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering Lobo Development's internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

Lobo Development was incorporated in the State of New Mexico on October 4, 2007. It was organized under the amended State of New Mexico's University Research Park Ac t. The name of the Act has since been changed to the University Research Park and Economic Development Act. Lobo Development was established to benefit the UNM Regents by relieving the University of New Mexico from the responsibilities to acquire, own, manage, and develop certain real estate in a commercially reasonable manner and to maximize the University's return from these assets; by contributing all of the corporation's net revenues to the University for the support of the teaching, research, and service mission of the University; and by creating learning opportunities for students in this development activity. The activities of the corpor ation shall include the acquisition, development, disposition, and rental of real esta te for the benefit of the University. Under the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the UNM Regents and Lobo Development signed in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, Lobo Development may plan, direct, and coordinate its business activities in accordance with a mutually agree d-upon development proposal and development agreement between Lobo Development and UNM. Lobo Development operations will be funded by an administrative fee assigned to approved projects. If Lobo Development revenues are more than sufficient to meet its anticipated financial obligations based on a mutually appr oved annual budget, it is the intent of the parties that excess revenue shall be distributed back to UNM. For the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, $650,000 and $775,000 was distributed back to UNM, respectively. Primary activities performed by Lobo Development during the year ended June 30, 2021 focused on efforts to establish a bioscience lab near the Lobo Rainforest Building, marketing of commercial sites along Gibson Boulevard, and the establishment of a Tax Increment Development District in partnership with the City of Albuquerque. Lobo Development provides services only to UN M. Lobo Development does not have any component units. Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices Basis of Accounting and Presentation As a proprietary fund, Lobo Development's financial statements are reported using a flow of economic resources measurement focus and the full accrual basis of accounting. Accordingly, revenues are recognized when they are earned and expenses are recognized as soon as the liability is incurred. Operating revenues and expenses are those incurred that relate directly to project management services. All other revenues and expenses are considered non-operating. Lobo Development Corporation (A Component Unit of the University of New Mexico) Notes to Financial Statements 12 Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Practices (continued) The accompanying financial statements include onl y the accounts of Lobo Development, which has no component units. Net Position For accounting and reporting purposes, Lobo Developm ent reports its net position in the following categories as applicable: Net investment in capital assets - capital assets net of accumulated depreciation and debt incurred to finance the capital asset acquisition. Unrestricted - net position that is not subject to externally imposed constraints. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires that management make estimates and assump tions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statements dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during these reporting periods. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Lobo Development considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchase to be cash equivalents. For purposes of the statement of cash flows, Lobo Development considers cash and cash equivalents to be cash deposits and amounts held by its fiscal agent. Revenue Recognition Lobo Development recognizes operating revenue for services earned under the terms of the MOA. Lobo Development's revenue for the fiscal year ended 2021 originated from the following sources: (1) Student Housing project/ACC Component I, (2) Re imbursement Revenue, (3) Rent from four occupancy leases. Lobo Development's revenue for the fiscal year ended 2020 originated from the following sources: (1) Student Housing project/A CC Component I, (2) Student Housing project/ACC Component II, (3) Reimbursement Revenue, (4) Rent from three occupancy leases. All revenue from these sources is originally paid to UNM and UNM determines which revenue streams are allocated to Lobo Development. Income Taxes Lobo Development is exempt from federal income tax on income related to its exempt purposes under Section 501(a) of the Internal Re venue Code (Code) as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code.

Per Section 12-6-10 NMSA 1978, Lobo Development follows UNM's capitalization policy fo r moveable equipment includes all items with a unit cost of $5,000 or more and an estimated useful life of greater than one year. Renovations to buildings, infrastructure, and land improvements that si gnificantly increase the value or extend the useful life of the structure are capitalized.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered Lobo Development's internal control over financial reporting (internal cont rol) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on t he financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Lobo Development's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Lobo Development's internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of pe rforming their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in inte rnal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financ ial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficienc ies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.20 Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about w hether Lobo Development's financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant ag reements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providi ng an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or ot her matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards . Purpose of this Report The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an op inion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

Protect the critical core missions of providing education, creating new knowledge and developing creative works, providing public service, and delivering patient care, so that we may achieve our fundamental missions both now and into the long -term fut ure. 2.Be mindful of the ways in which our choices and the exogenous influences to which we are subject might exacerbate inequality, and make decisions to protect our most vulnerable students, staff, and faculty, so that we will continue to ensure social mob ility for our students and live into our fundamental UNM values. 3.Ensure that we can attract great students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels, and provide the services and supports necessary for their success, both because their learning and success is a key part of our mission and because their enrollment is a key source of the revenue and state support that allows us to deliver on that mission. 4.Make decisions that enhance our ability to engage in cutting edge and applied research, scholarship, and creative production, and which enhance our opportunities to generate the external resources on which this work often rests, so that we can continu e now and for the long -run to create the intellectual foundation for our educational and service enterprise, and generate the new idea s that society requires. 5. Continue to ensure compliance and safety , so that the UNM environment will be one in which our community can work, learn, and grow without fear or unacceptable risk. 6. Continue long-range, all -enterprise, all funds budget planning, so that we can ensure the long -term future and impact of UNM and decrease volatility in our resource base. 19THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICOBudget Priorities and Workplan Investment in Compensation Faculty Startup Funding Reserve Balance Investment in FacilitiesBudget Leadership Team's (BLT) goal is to ensure we have sufficient:BLT Tuition and Fee Committee's goal is to have a proposal to ensure we have: Affordability for All New MexicansStrong Graduation and Retention Rates A Simpler Rate StructureCompetitive Rates that Keep in Line with InflationGENERAL OBLIGATION BOND PROJECTS: College of Fine Arts Center for Collaborative Arts & Technology $65,000,000 Children's Psychia tric Center $40,000, 000 INSTRUCTION & GENERAL FUNDING: Provide for 10% funding increase to restore FY21 cuts Also provide base adjustment for na tionwide inflation now affecting group and liability insurance and additional utility costs WORKFORCE PIPELINE: Support expansion of high-impact programs in PreK-12 teacher educa tion, nursing and other health professions COMPENSATION: Support additional compensation increase of at least 7% for recruitment and r etention of quality faculty and staff to protect and enhance state competitiveness within the current U.S. inflationary environment LOTTERY SCHOLARSHIP: Support students' efforts to bring more stability to the Lottery Scholarship Fund Legislative Priorities In scholarships & grants awarded in academic year '20-'21Fall 2021 enrollment across all campuses Degrees & certificates awarded in academic year '20-'21FY23 LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES 25,000+ 6,000+ Degree & certificate programs available including 95+ baccalaureate programs 85+ master's programs 40+ doctoral programs 5 professional practice doctoral programs$110,000,000+ GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND REQUESTS College of Fine Arts Center for Collaborative Arts & Technology .................. $65,000,000 Children's Psychiatric Project ........................................

Stokes, President The University of New MexicoLegislative Finance Committee (LFC) UNM State Appropriation Increase $12.9M or 3.8% (excluding compensation) Core Fund I&G formula Increase at $5.9M or 3%. There is contingent language that HED will withhold 1% or $2.4M of the I&G base as a result of declini ng enrollment until an enrollment plan is submitted. The LFC Recommendation provides for a 3% salary increase in the last quarter of FY22 and an additional 4% in FY23. The compounding effect of separating the two raise amounts results in an overall 7.12% increase. Funded at 70%. In addition, the LFC recommendation includes funding to increase minimum wage to $13.50. ERB Employer Contribution Increase: Total of 2% in FY23. Last year, SB42 increased the employer contribution by 1% in FY23. Could Enrollment Enrollment Management is projecting a 2% increase in undergraduate and graduate enrollment. 23Mandatory Student Fees The Student Fee Review Board recommended to the Budget Leadership Team a 1% fee increase.

On the income statement, we record: The year -over -year change in the pension liability The year -over -year change in the retiree health benefit liability, determined by an actuarial valuation including assumptions and the net position of the trust account On the balance sheet, we record: The total unfunded pension liability The total retiree health liability, determined by an actuarial valuation based on UNM's proportion of the entire Educational Retiree Liabilities on Net Income Net Income/(Loss) before non-cash adjustments Net income/(loss) after non-cash adjustments Dollars in millionsWhat do these unfunded pension and retiree health benefit liabilities really mean for UNM? Retirement Benefit (The New Mexico Educational Retirement Act, ERA): The liability is UNM's proportion of the net pension liability of the entire Plan, determined each year by an actuar ial valuation. The liability increase or decrease will fluctuate each year depending on the assumptions used in the actuar ial valuation, set by the Plan's Board of Trustees. Significant assumptions used in the valuation include Inflation Factor, Salary Increase %, Investment Rate of Retu rn, Mortality, and Retirement Age. Retiree Health Benefit (Other Post -Employment Benefits, OPEB): The UNM administers The Retiree Welfare Benefit Plan and is the fiduciary of the Retiree Welfare Benefit Trust ( the VEBA.) Employees hired prior to July 1, 2015 that have contributed to the VEBA Trust for five consecutive years immedi ately prior to retirement are eligible for the benefit. The liability is an annual actuarial valuation determination based on assumptions for Salary Increases, Inve s tment Rate of Return, Healthcare Cost Trends and Rates, and the Net Position of the Benefit Trust. Changes to the Plan since inception in addition to growth of the Trust account should reduce liability over time. Note: UNM Hospital, UNM Medical Group and Sandoval Regional Medical Center do not participate in the Educational Retirement B oard (ERB) pension or retiree health benefit. 4243Making strategic capital investments, leveraging our cash, and being attentive to our debt remain key balance sheet focus areas Total FY21 Assets $5.0 Billion Total FY21 Liabilities and Net Position $5.0 BillionAssets = Liabilities + Net Position Cash, Investments, and Trusteed Assets , $1,749 Land, Buildings, Equipment, Libraries, and Collections (net of depreciation) , $1,374 Receivables, Deferred Outflows, Other Liabilities , $816 Retiree Benefit Liabilities and Due Revenues Expenses Net IncomeUNM projections reflect a combined positive net income for all years of the forecast period FY22 -FY31 44Revenues presented net of intra -university activities (allocations, transfers, reserves); expenses presented net of extraordinar y itemsActuals Projection Dollars in millionsRevenue from competitive markets will continue to be our dominant source of funds in ($M) Patient Revenues Grants Contracts Appropriations Sales Services All Revenues ($M) Patient Revenues Grants Contracts Appropriations Sales Services All other revenues Source ($M) 2020- 21 ShareInc/Dec compared to base year Source ($M) 2030- 31 Share Patient Revenues $1,595 50% 68.6% Patient Revenues $2,689 59% Grants Contracts 254 8% 6.4% Services 271 6% All Other Revenues 470 15% 17.9% All Other Revenues 554 11% Total top 5 FY21 revenues $3,191 100% Total top 5 FY31 revenues the 10 -yrprojection period of FY22 - FY31, revenue increases are driven by UNM Reven ues Patient Revenu es Grants Contracts Appropriations Sales Services Total Expenses Salaries Patient Care Costs Other Expense Supplies Revenues presented net of intra -university activities (allocations, transfers, reserves); expenses presented net of extraordinar y itemsFY31 projected revenues and expenses as compared to base year FY21Revenues Expenses47Sensitivities: 1% change in key drivers can significantly impact net income over the projection period Analyzed key areas of revenue and expenditures for both campus and health segments of the combined enterprise.

Protect the critical core missions of providing education, creating new knowledge and developing creative works, providing public service, and delivering patient care, so that we may achieve our fundamental missions both now and into the long -term fut ure. 2.Be mindful of the ways in which our choices and the exogenous influences to which we are subject might exacerbate inequality, and make decisions to protect our most vulnerable students, staff, and faculty, so that we will continue to ensure social mob ility for our students and live into our fundamental UNM values. 3.Ensure that we can attract great students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels, and provide the services and supports necessary for their success, both because their learning and success is a key part of our mission and because their enrollment is a key source of the revenue and state support that allows us to deliver on that mission. 4.Make decisions that enhance our ability to engage in cutting edge and applied research, scholarship, and creative production, and which enhance our opportunities to generate the external resources on which this work often rests, so that we can continu e now and for the long -run to create the intellectual foundation for our educational and service enterprise, and generate the new idea s that society requires. 5. Continue to ensure compliance and safety , so that the UNM environment will be one in which our community can work, learn, and grow without fear or unacceptable risk. 6. Continue long-range, all -enterprise, all funds budget planning, so that we can ensure the long -term future and impact of UNM and decrease volatility in our resource base. 82FY 2021- 22 Forecast Main Campus Core Fund Revenue Sources Fall 2021 Update 83FY 2021- 22 Enterprise Forecast Total Revenues Sources $3.96 Billion Main Campus Core Funds: $382.9M State Appropriations Tuition and Fees F and A Recovery Investment Income Other Funds: $3.58 Billion Patient Revenues Contract and Grants External Sales Private Gifts Investment Income 84 FY 2021-22 Forecast -Main Campus Core Fund Revenue Sources $382.9 million State Appropriations and Tuition and Fee Revenues comprise 87% of all FY22 Main Campus Core Fund Revenue Sources 85 State Appropriations $197,843,000 Tuition Revenue $110,435,361 State Land, Permanent, Interest Income and Other $28,908,109 Mandatory Student Fee Revenue $24,939,909 F&A Recovery $20,779,240 Total Revenues $382,905,618FY 2021-22 Forecast -Main Campus Core Fund Allocations $382.9 million Core fund allocations are primarily used for recurring academic and administrative operations.
