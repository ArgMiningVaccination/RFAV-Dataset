Brannon, MD Updated on May 25, 2023 Medically reviewed by Casey Gallagher, MD Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents Symptoms Causes Diagnosis Treatment Prevention Dark spots on the skin can happen at any time but most commonly appear in middle age. They are most often a result of cumulative exposure to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet (UV) light used in tanning beds. Dark spots can occur on the face or other areas that are often exposed to the sun. The spots are also associated with certain skin conditions and can be a side effect of some medications. This article explains the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of dark spots on the face and body. Other Names for Dark Spots Age spotsHyperpigmentationLiver spotsSolar lentigines Verywell / Zoe Hansen Dark Spot Symptoms Dark spots are generally harmless, but there are times when they could be cancerous. That's why it's important to check with a healthcare provider if you notice new symptoms. Even when the spots aren't dangerous, if they bother you, they can often be lightened or removed. Spots on the skin can range from light to dark brown or black in color. They are flat and generally oval-shaped. Dark spots can develop anywhere. But they are most likely to appear on parts of the body that receive the most sun exposure. These include: FaceBacks of the handsShouldersArmsBack While individual spots are usually small, several can group and form larger areas of darkened skin. Aging Spots on Legs: What's Normal and What's Not Causes Dark spots are the result of the overproduction or collection of melanin, a skin pigment that makes skin darker. They can also result from damage from free radicals, which are unstable molecules that attack healthy cells and eventually cause skin to appear aged. Exposure to UV Light The sun and tanning beds are the most significant cause of dark spots. Hyperpigmentation often appears during middle age. That's when the skin starts to show the consequences of sun exposure. This is especially true if you didn't use sunscreen and other sun-protective measures consistently earlier in life. People with light hair or skin and who have had many sunburns, or severe ones, are at particular risk. However, other things may lead to dark spots. These other causes may act alone or in combination with UV exposure. Skin Conditions There are several different skin conditions and diseases that can cause dark spots. However, these are not the same as age-related dark spots. They include: Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation: Skin discoloration following an allergic reaction, infection, burn, or acne Melasma: Also known as pregnancy mask or chloasma Linea nigra: A dark, vertical line that appears lengthwise down the middle of the abdomen during pregnancy Riehl's melanosis: A form of contact dermatitis that's believed to be caused by sun exposure Poikiloderma of Civatte: A benign (non-cancerous) condition that turns parts of the neck a reddish-brown color Erythromelanosis follicularis: A reddish-brown pigmentation of the face and neck How Melanoma vs. Sunspots Look on Skin Medications Certain medications can cause dark spots because they make the skin more sensitive to sun exposure (also known as photosensitivity). They include: Estrogens, such as (minocycline) Amiodarone used (brand names include Cordarone and Pacerone) Phenytoin, an anticonvulsant (brand names include Dilantin and Phenytek) Phenothiazines used to treat mental and emotional disorders (brand names include Compro and Thorazine) Sulfonamides used to treat infections (brand names include Bactrim and Septra) Other Causes Dark spots may also be seen in these conditions: Pregnancy Liver disease Addison's disease Hemochromatosis (excessive iron) Pituitary tumors Diagnosis Your primary healthcare provider or a dermatologist can usually diagnose dark spots with a physical examination. Unless a spot looks suspicious, a biopsy or further testing is not necessary. Treatment Dark spots don't hurt, and they have the same texture as the rest of your skin. Most of the time, they don't pose any health risks. So you don't have to get rid of them, although some people choose to for cosmetic reasons. Some dark spots, such as ones cause by acne, may fade on their own over time. Others can be faded or removed completes with topical treatments, but these may require several months of use. Cosmetic procedures such as cryosurgery, laser treatment, and chemical peels can remove dark spots entirely, but may not be an option for people with sensitive skin. Home Remedies There aren't many DIY remedies that have been proven to lighten dark spots. One option may be applying the juice from fruits such as lemons, oranges, grapefruit, or papaya on your skin. These fruits contain vitamin C, which the American Academy of Dermatology lists as an ingredient that may help to lighten dark spots. While there's not enough scientific evidence to show that applying the juice from these fruits directly to the skin can help dark spots fade, you can give it a try. Because these fruits are acidic, it's best to do a test first by mixing the fruit juice with water and rubbing a small amount on the skin. You may have heard that apple cider vinegar can help remove dark spots, but there's no scientific support for this claim. Topical Treatments Prescription skin bleaching creams gradually diminish the appearance of dark spots. This usually takes several months. Hydroquinone is the active ingredient in prescription skin lightening creams. It works by reducing melanin production. However, long-term use has some risks, so you should only use it on a short-term basis. Some research has indicated that hydroquinone may cause cancer at higher concentrations. For this reason, the Food and Drug Administration has limited the concentration of hydroquinone to 3% to 4% in prescription products and 2% in over-the-counter (OTC) products. Several other OTC products treat dark spots. They might lessen the appearance of spots but may not eliminate them. To lighten dark spots caused specifically by pimples, the American Academy of Dermatology Association recommends creams that contain the retinoids retinol or adapalene. Creams with those ingredients may also work to lighten hyperpigmentation in general. Also look for creams that contain alpha hydroxy acid, glycolic acid, deoxyarbutin, or kojic acid. Side effects, including redness, swelling, and skin irritation can occur with any topical medication. Skin lightening products contain abrasive ingredients that also make the skin extremely sensitive to UV exposure. So it's essential to wear sunscreen with SPF consistently throughout treatment. Cosmetic Procedures Healthcare providers and estheticians can use medical procedures to treat dark spots on any part of the body. They are often used along with topical treatments. However, some may not be appropriate for people with sensitive skin. Options include: Laser treatment: This uses focused light energy to remove skin layer-by-layer, which burns off dark spots. Risks include bruising, swelling, redness, tightness, scarring, infection, and changes in skin texture. Chemical peels: These contain salicylic acid and/or glycolic acid, which remove the top layer of skin. This may result in healthier and more evenly toned skin beneath. However, skin irritation is a possible risk. Microdermabrasion: There are two types of microdermabrasion. Both physically remove cells on the surface of the skin. With crystal microdermabrasion, a machine sprays fine crystals through a wand that rubs against the skin and scrapes away cells. For diamond-tipped microdermabrasion, the abrasive end of a wand is used for this purpose instead. The skin may be pink for a while afterward, but these techniques are considered low-risk. Cryosurgery: Cryosurgery fades age spots by freezing them with a liquid nitrogen solution. This causes the darkened skin to peel away from the body. Risks include permanent whitening of treated areas. How can I get rid of dark spots naturally? What Is Microdermabrasion? Prevention As you age, dark spots may be inevitable. However, there are some ways to help avoid getting dark spots or prevent faded ones from returning: Use SPF: Be diligent about wearing and reapplying sunscreen every two hours. Reapply more frequently if you've been swimming or sweating a lot.Cover up: When outdoors, wear a hat, long sleeves, and pants. SPF fabrics can offer added protection.Avoid peak sun hours: UV exposure is usually greatest between the hours of 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. What Does the SPF Number Mean? Summary Dark spots commonly occur as people age. They are often the result of past sun exposure. But they can also be due to some skin conditions, medications, and certain medical conditions. Often your healthcare provider or dermatologist can diagnose dark spots by looking at them. But in some cases, they may do a skin biopsy to be sure. Dark spots are usually harmless. Even so, some people choose to have them removed for cosmetic reasons. Treatment options include skin-lightening creams and cosmetic procedures. You may not be able to prevent dark spots entirely. But, you can reduce your risk by using sunscreen, covering up when you are in the sun, and staying out of the sun during peak hours. A Word From Verywell Visit your dermatologist annually for a skin checkup, even if you think any oddities on your skin are harmless. Though a dark spot is likely nothing to worry about, remember that skin color changes can sometimes be a sign of cancer. That's particularly true when paired with other changes such as bleeding, itching, and redness. In rare cases, what can appear as a sunspot such as a solar lentigo may, in fact, represent a type of melanoma called lentigo maligna. If your healthcare provider sees a potentially harmful dark spot, they can perform a biopsy to check for something more serious, like skin cancer. 18 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
