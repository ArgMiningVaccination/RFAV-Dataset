There is a need for effective and accessible treatments for SARS -CoV-2. Repurposing drugs already approved for other indications may provide a rapid alternative to de-novo drug development. Methods We conducted searches for preclinical studies (in vivo, in vitro and in silico) and other publication types (e.g. systematic reviews, editorials, and opinion pieces) assessing drugs that could potentially be repurposed for SARS -CoV-2. Studies of d rugs already in human trials or approved for use for SARS - CoV-2 were excluded . We produced an evidence map and narrative synthesis surrounding the most promising candidates for specific mechanisms of action, based on the best level of evidence. Results We ident ified 530 eligible studies, the majority of which were in silico studies (N = 242). Based on the best level of evidence and report ing by study authors: eight drugs were identified as having potential to inhibit SARS -CoV-2 entry into host cells; 11 were ide ntified as potential inhibitors of spike protein attaching to host cells; one as possibly preventing viral entry into host cells via the ACE2 receptor; eight as potential inhibitors of viral replication; four as potentially being able to target SARS -CoV-2 RdRp; three as possible inhibitors of SARS -CoV-2 Mpro; and two as potential inhibitors of the SARS - CoV-2 cytopathic response and immune system effects. Conclusions Thirty -seven therapeutic agents with potentially promising effects on SARS -CoV-2 were identi fied. However, further well -designed preclinical and clinical research is needed to establish their efficacy. 5 Background Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) threatens public health at a global level, with more than 131 million confirmed cases globally (as of 06 April 20211). Given the high infectivity of this virus , and the fact that one in five people infected are hospitalised with serious health consequences, it is vitally important to address how to improve treatment practices.2 There are currently few approved medications for treating SARS -CoV-2,3,4 however, a range of drug therapies are being trialled to test their efficacy a nd safety.5 The treatments currently being evaluated range from those that target virus entry, replication or shedding (the life cycle of SARS -CoV-2), to those which reduce pulmonary effects, inflammation or cardiovascular effects.5-10 At least seven vaccines are now in use for immunisation against SARS -CoV-2 infection . Mass vaccination started in December 2020 and , as of 15 February 2021, 175.3 million vaccine doses ha d been administered globally. Nevertheless, the impact of COVID -19 vaccines on the pandemic is dependent upon the effectiveness of the vaccines; how quickly they are approved, manufactured, and delivered; the possible development of other variants ; and how many people get vaccinated .11 Furthermore, there is still a pressing need for more effective treatments for the long -term health impacts of SARS -CoV-2. Due to the need for effective and accessible treatments for SARS -CoV-2, there have been specific efforts to repurpose or reposition approved and established drug s. This approach to identifying medications leads to a shorter drug development cycle than experimental drug development and only requires upscaling of established production processes rather than generation of de novo systems .12 As generics of repurposed or repositioned drugs are often instantly available , the cost of drugs developed in this way tends to be lower .12 There is a burgeoning and disparate literature on repurposed or repositioned drug candidates for treating SARS -CoV-2 (from reduction in virus levels to recovery and rehabilitation). In October 2020 , a mapping review was completed which provide d an overview of evidence from hypothesis driving and preclinical studies that identif ied possible SARS -CoV-2 treatment candidates f or clinical trial testing. In this review update, we incorporate additional findings from new studies published up until February 2020, that were not included in the earlier review. Aim and objectives Our aim is to give an up -to-date evidence overview of the drug repurposing research landscape in relation to SARS -CoV-2, and to identify the most plausible treatment candidates for trial as of February 2021. To achieve this aim, our objectives are as follows . 1. To identify any hypothesis driving studies for SARS -CoV-2 (e.g. use of computational drug discovery for repositioning) that summarise potential repurposed drug candidates 2. To identify any drug library screening studies (including high throughput screening studies or virtual, in silico drug screens) that summarise potential repurposed drug candidates 6 3. To identify any in vitro and in vivo studies that summarise potential repurposed drug candidates for clinical trials 4. To produce a narrative synthesis and map of potential repurposed drug candidates for clinical trial, critically appraising the level of evidence indicating each as a potential candidate Methods Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Study design We included the following studies: in vitro studies ; in vivo in animal models including non -human primates; and drug library screens identifying repurposed therapeutic agents targeting SARS -CoV-2 (including high throughput screening studies or virtual, in silico drug screens), in addition to systematic and scoping reviews of these studies. We also include d studies describing potential adverse effects of the identified candidate drugs, in addition to those describing potential therapeutic effects. Reviews, letters, editorials, and commentaries were included if they fulfilled the other inclusion criteria. At citation screening stage , we included studies where the title or abstract did not mention specific candidate drugs but instead only a candidate drug category or repurposing/repositioning for SARS - CoV-2. If the full text studies did not identify a specific drug , these studies were excluded. We coded for but excluded any preclinical, in vitro, in silico and high -throughput studies where the candidate drug (or drugs) of interest are now being evaluated in humans (i.e. within randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, co hort studies, case studies, cross -sectional studies and case - control studies), or which are now in human use for SAR S-CoV-2. In addition, we coded for, but did not include non-English language studies. Coding for but not including these studies allows us t o estimate the number of potentially relevant studies excluded from the review and allows for full assessment later if indicated. Any studies on human participants were excluded. Otherwise, we did not restrict by animal models , cell line, cell culture or by the type of high -throughput screen or in silico/computational approaches in the studies reviewed . To be included a study must have focused on candidates for treating SARS -CoV-2 or its resultant physical morbidities. Interventions We included off -label drugs, vitamins and dietary supplements that have been approved by established regulatory authorities recognised by the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities and could potentially be used in treating the SARS -CoV-2 infection or its resultant physical morbidities. Approval for indications other than SARS -CoV-2 was identified using the British National Formulary (BNF), US F ood and Drug Administration (FDA) , European Medicines Agency (EMA) , Electronic Medicines Compendium (EMC) and Global Data, using their respective websites . Both i ndividual and combination therapies were included. The following were excluded from the review: 7 Studies identifying biological targets for treatment (e.g. a disease pathway that could be modulated) but no candidate drug Pre- and post -exposure prophylactic (preventative) interventions (e.g. SARS -CoV-2 vaccines and face masks) Complementary or alternative medicines Diagnostic tools (e.g. chest x -rays) Non-drug treatments (e.g. equipment and SOPs such as venti lator protocols , patient management techniques) Treatments involving gases (e.g. oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, mixed gas treatments) Any treatments already being used for treating SARS -CoV-2 patients in clinical trials or in practice (e.g. convalescent plasma therapy) Main Outcome(s) To be eligible for inclusion, the record had to identify at least one drug candidate as a potential treatment for SARS -CoV-2 infection or r esultant physical morbidities. We excluded papers identifying candidate drug(s) for t reating the mental health impacts of SARS -CoV-2. Mechanisms of Action Where reported within included records , we extracted data on the mechanism of action (MoA) or the World Health Organization (WHO) Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical classification (ATC) for e ach identified drug candidate . Extracted data was coded to our pre -defined categories (including 'miscellaneous' MoAs) with expert input if required (from either SA, FZ, AW or DO). Where the MoA was reported too vaguely for identification or not described at all candidate drugs were coded as 'not reported' . We also consulted experts to validate the plausibility of each identified candidate drug for treating SARS - CoV-2 or SARS -CoV-2-induced physical morbidities. Search Strategy We performed the updated searc h on 12 February 2021 using three databases: the SARS -CoV-2-specific COAP Living Evidence on COVID -19 (includes pre -prints); Embase (1996 to 202 1 week 05); and Scopus (2019 to February 2021) . Full details of the search terms used for each database can be found in Appendix A. We present the flow of literature throughout the process and the results of the search using a PRISMA diagram.13 Retrieved studies were downloaded into an Endnote X9 library an d de-duplicated. Data extraction (selection and coding) De-duplicated titles and abstracts were uploaded to a R ayyan14 screening library and screened independently by two reviewers ( LT and EJ) in relation to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, with advice from a third reviewer where required ( FP or AW). Due to t ime constraints i n the earlier review, only records that reported candidate drugs not in clinical development or in use for the treatment of SARS -CoV-2 in the title or abstract were included in the full 8 text screen . Any studies not reporting a relevant drug in the title or abstract were filed separately awaiting classification . A scoping exercise indicated that 60% of these filed records reported eligible drugs in the ir full text. Consequently, in th e review update reported here, we included records regardless of whether they explicitly reported relevant drugs in their title or abstract , if they otherwise fit eligibility criteria . This included incorporating the studies that were previously filed as not reporting drug names in their title or abstract as relevant . Discrepancies in screening decisions were resolved through discussion between reviewers (LT and EJ) and adjudication if needed by a furth er reviewer (FP). The full texts of potentially relevant records were screened using the same method (in duplicate by EJ and either LT, SA or FZ) and with adjudication if needed by a further reviewer ( either FP or LT as appropriate ). For the initial review, records were screened by reviewers with a background in evidence synthesis (LT and EJ) and an expe rt in drug development (AW) independently screened 10% of titles and abstracts to allow us to estimate the accuracy of screening decisions made by the review team. For the 2021 update, reviewers with a background in evidence synthesis (LT and EJ) and revie wers with a background in pharmacy (SA and FZ) undertook the full-text screening. The full texts of included studies were uploaded to EPPI -Reviewer web software tool,15 which was used for data extraction. We iteratively created a data extraction form within this software package, piloting it on a sample of included stu dies and refining as needed . For the original review, items on the data extraction form included the following: study citation; study design; candidate drug(s); in vitro or animal model (in vivo) tested; MoA or ATC classification; primary outcomes reported ; descriptive list of known adverse events or toxicity; and conclusions (e.g. subset of drugs identified as being most promising amongst those listed). For the updated review, we did not extract information on outcomes reported other than candidate drugs , descriptive list of known adverse events or toxicity , pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics of the drugs. Data were extracted by one reviewer (out of LT, EJ, SA, FZ and R PWK) with 10% of studies extracted checked for accuracy and completeness by a second re viewer (out of SA and FZ ). The opinion of a third reviewer ( LT or EJ as appropriate ) was sought to resolve discrepancies in relation to the extracted data. Quality Appraisal For the original review, w e had initially planned to use the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Risk of Bias Tool for Human and Animal Studies 16 and a quality assessment checklist developed for computational studies by Silva et al 17 to evaluate the level of internal validity of included studies. These tool s were piloted on a small sampl e (5%) of studies identified by the original search strategy (October 2020) . A high level of items assessed by the tools were not reported in sufficient detail in each study assessed to make an informed judgement on whether they would introduce bias or not. The tools were thus unable to discriminate between high - and low -quality studies amongst those included in this review. Given this, planned quality assessment was not undertaken. However, we synthesised results preferentia lly from studies rated higher in the drug repositioning evidence level (DREL) with amendment (Table 1 ),18 which grades each drug repositioning candidate according to the level of scientific evidence available. 9 Strategy for data synthesis We present a narrative synthesis of results indicating the amount and quality of evidence available. We used a 'best available evidence' approach to synthesise the data from the available studies.19 Using this method, for each MoA the highest level of available evidence is reported and, when data from the highest level of evidence were unavailable, the nex t level of evidence was referred to. The levels of evidence applied to this synthesis w ere an adapted version of the DREL criteria,18 which grades drug repositioning candidates according to the level of scientific evidence available (Table 1). Non - experimental studies are lowest in the hierarchy, with increased position in the hierarchy for studies using models that are more applicable to humans. We also considered the reliability of the study design, with systematic reviews considered superior to ind ividual studies. Scoping reviews which included some documentation of their methods, such as the search strategy used to locate primary evidence, were considered at the same level as full syst ematic reviews. Table 1: Hierarchy of evidence used in this revi ew (based on DREL criteria)18 Level of evidence Type of study 1a Systematic reviews of in vivo studies 1b Primary in vivo studies 2a Systematic reviews of in vitro studies 2b Primary in vitro studies 3a Systematic reviews of in silico studies 3b Primary in silico studies 4 Non-research studies, including commentaries, opinion pieces, editorials and non -systematic reviews No statistical analysis was planned. Rather, we produced a visual map indicating the volume and type of research indicating each drug as a most likely trial candidate and highlighting the MoA listed by study authors for each indicated candidate drug or, wh ere no MoA was reported, as identified by an expert in drug development (AW or DO ). Results After deduplication, 2383 records were identified from the searches. Following title and abstract screening, 716 records were judged to be relevant and were screene d based on full text, where available. Of these, we excluded 180 records . Most records were excluded for breaching multiple inclusion criteria. The first noted exclusion reason for each record was as follows: 145 did not report a relevant drug; four invest igated the wrong outcome ; 23 did not use a n eligible study design; full texts 10 were unobtainable for three records; one article was not published in English and four additional duplicates were identified. The flow of literature is detailed in the PRISMA13 diagram (Figure 1). Figure 1: PRISMA13 flow diagram depicting the flow of included and excluded studies through the systematic review process. Description of included studies The designs of the 530 included studies were varied and are summarised in Table 2. In brief, one study (0.19%) was purely in vivo, 52 were purely in vitro (10%) and 244 were purely in silico (46%). One hundred and eighty -nine papers ( 35.6%) were classified as being another design; details of these are documented in Table 2. Forty -four papers (8.1%) incorporated more than one design; details of design combinations are also presented in Table 2. 11 Table 2: Designs of papers included in this review Design Number Preclinical designs In vivo 1 In vitro 54 In silico 242 Other designs Research stakeholder insights 83 Non-systematic secondary research 96 Systematic secondary research 10 Combinations In vivo and in vitro 4 In vivo, in vitro and in silico 1 In vitro and in silico 26 In vitro and other 4 In silico and other 9 The primary cells, cell lines , tissues and virus strains used in the in vitro studies varied greatly and are summarised in Table 3. The most used cell -line across all studies was Vero E6. Nine studies used in vitro methods which either did not report or utilis e primary cells, cell line s, cell culture, tissues or virus strains .20-28 One study used A549 cells supplemented with a vector expressing ACE2, Calu -3 cells, and NHBE cells as w ell as two lung samples derived from COVID -19 patients compared against two healthy lung tissue biopsie s.29 Another study performed GRP78 gene expression studies in the blood of SARS - CoV-2 (+) versus SARS -CoV-2 () pneumonia patients .30 Table 3: Primary cells, cell lines , tissues and virus strains used in in vitro studies Originating organism Originating tissue Primary cells, Cell line s, Virus strains Study ID Human Lung A549 Abdulla 2020b 2020a84 coronaviruses NTU156 Ke 202060 Only one study was a purely in vivo design100, which used male C57BL/6 J mice (1822 g) as its model organism .

The results are presented below grouped by the MoA, as reported by study authors or pharmacy experts , through which drugs are indicated as exerting their potential therapeutic effect. The following MoA groups were used: inhibiti on of viral entry ; inhibition of viral entry via ACE2 receptors; inhibition of viral cell attachment to SARS -CoV-2 spike protein ; inhibiti on of viral replication ; inhibiti on of main viral protease (Mpro); inhibiti on of viral RNA - dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp); and inhibiti on of cytopathic and immune effects. 14 There were 29 papers where the MoA identifi ed did not fall into any of the predefi ned categories. 23,32,40,82,105 -129 In addition, 20 papers did not clearly report the MoA. 57,66,101,113,124,127,128,130 -142 These studies are included in the evidence map as having 'Miscellaneous' or 'Not reported' MoAs , respectively . Of these papers, 25 partially reported on MoAs giving information for some drugs they listed as most effective and not for other listed drugs or, report ing MoAs that did not fall into predefined category.23,32,57,108 -111,113 -116,118 -123,125,127 -130,138,140,142 For these 25 papers, we have only included the reported MoA or MoA that fell into one of the pre -defined categories and their drugs in the narrative synthesis .

An abbreviated map indicating volume (one square indicating one study) and type s of study identifying repositioning drug candidates within each indicated mechanism of action Page 16 of 60 Inhibition of viral entry The SARS -CoV-2 surface spike protein binds to the host cell angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor once proteolytically activated, mediating a further chain of cellular events that mediate SARS - CoV-2 entry into the cell.143 Different proteases are also important for cell entry , including cleavage of the SARS -CoV-2 spike protein to 'activate' cell -cell fusion E lastase; Plasmin; TMPRSS2; and Trypsin. Fusion peptides (smaller than proteins) can also interact and facilitate viral fusion with the host cell membrane.143 Thirty papers assessed drugs for inhibition of viral entry.35,42,44,61,70,86,97,138,144 -163 Four studies had an in vitro design , 35,36,70,86 while three other studies had both an in vitro and in silico design .42,44,97 Eleven studies had an in silico design .61,146 -148,150,155,157,159 -161,164 Twelve had another design .138,144,145,149,151 - 154,156,158,162,1 63 The six studies with either an in vitro or combination of in vitro and in silico designs provided the best level of evidence for this Mo A.35,36,42,44,70,8 6,97 Guimond 2020 identified azelastine hydrochloride be effective.35 Pimozide was the drug identified by Vatansever 2020 and, finally, Wan 2020 identified apatinib.44,97 Inhibition of surface spike protein The SARS -CoV-2 surface spike (S) protein has two subunits: S2, which fusion process; and S1 , which utilises hACE2 as the receptor to infect human cells. Spike proteins assemble into trimers on the virion surface to form the distinctive \"corona\", or crown -like appearance. Spike proteins are an integral part of the virus \"infection \" protein, fusing with the human host cell through the S1 subunit or S2 subunit via the hACE 2 receptor.143 Forty -six studies identified possibly effective drugs that m ay inhibit the surface spike protein.23,51,56,76,79,89,96,110,114,125,130,131,138,142,150,152,155,165 -193 No in vivo studies were identified. Two studies employed purely in vitro methods,56,76 while one used in vitr o methods co mbined with another design.89 In addition, four in vitro stud ies also employed in silico methods .23,51,79,96 Twenty -193 silico methods and another design.130,142 Seven s tudies used another design .125,138,152,176,180,185,188 As no in vivo studies were identified for this MoA, the in vitro studies provided the best level of evidence .23,51,56,76,79,89,96 In terms of the purely in vitro studies, Olaleye 2020 identified ambroxol hydrochloride (AMB),76 Rietdijk 2021 identified cathepsin L inhibitor .56 With regards to the studies that combined in vitro with in silico methods , promethazine as potential inhibitors of surface spike pro tein.79 Hsieh 2020 identified nifedipine and Lin 2020 noted ceftazidime to be potentially most effective.23,51 Cagno 2020, which combined in vitro and other methods, identified nilotinib as a potential inhibitor of surface spike protein.89 Page 17 of 60 Angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) interaction The main method of virus entry to the host cell, as has already been outlined, is by spike protein penetration, cell membrane fusion and injection of viral genetic material via the ACE2 receptor.143 Thirty -three studies investigated dr ugs targeting this mechanism of action.20,103,119 Three of these studies used mixed designs : one used in vitro and in vivo methods ;103 another study employed in vitro and in silico methods ;20 and the third study involved combination of in silico and meta -analysis .119 A further seven studies used a purely in vitro design21,33,34,36,37,49,68 and eight studies used an in silico design only.111,155,167,171,172,190,194,195 The remaining eleven studies used other methods comprising two computational analyses of transcriptomic datasets ,196,197 5 opinion pieces125,140,198 -200 and eight narrative reviews .109,128,138,201 -205 The in vitro and in vivo study by Ho (2020 ) represented the top level of evidence for identifying drugs targeting the interaction between SARS -CoV-2 and the ACE2 receptor .103 This study reported that two doses of Topotecan, an FDA-approved Top1 inhibitor, suppresse d infection -induced inflammation and reduce d morbidity and mortality in mouse and hamster models.103 Inhibition of RdRp RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which regulates viral replication, is proposed as a potential therapeutic target. This enzyme is involved in the replication and transcription of viral RNA, which becomes encased in viral proteins (as a capsule). Its inhibition arrest s viral replication.143 Thirty -one studies assessed drugs targeting the RdRp enzyme . Three studies used in vitro methods only27,53,83 and one study employed a mixed design, involving in vitro and in silico methods .72 One study was a scoping review of in silico studies ,176 one study comprised molecular docking and a literature review152 and seventeen used a n in silico design only.116,121,169,181,195,206 -218 The remaining e ight studies were non -systematic reviews.188,205,219 -224 The top level of evidence for this mechanism of action was p rovided by the three studies that used in vitro methods only27,53,83 and the study which used a mixed methods (in vitro and in silico) design .72 The drugs identified by the authors of these studies as being most effective , ordered here alphabetically, were: homoharringtonine (i nvestigated and 2021).53 (Mpro) protease (Mpro), also known as 3CLpro, is an enzyme belonging to a group of proteases that are involved in the formation of viral proteins. It is one of the coronavirus non -structural proteins (Nsp5) designated as a potential target for drug develo pment.143 Mpro cleaves the viral polyproteins, generating including the the helicase (Nsp13). Inhibition of Mpro prevent the virus from replication and , therefore , constitute one of the potential anticoronavirus strategies.143 Page 18 of 60 One hundred and twenty studies identified drugs in relation to this mechanism of action. Eight of these studies used in vitro methods only .26,30,31,57,64,77,81,225 Five studies used a combination of in vitro and in silico methods22,60,72,73,79 and one study used in vitro methods and presented a hypothesis .80 Eighty -eight studies used in silico methods only ;97,114,116,129,131,133,168,174,177,178,181,186,194,197,214,215,226 -296 three studies used in silico in addition to other methods, which included testing a hypothesis regarding the molecular structure of Sars-CoV-2,297 meta -analysis of gene expression profile datasets in relation to different cell type s,119 and a Bayesian approach to a systematic review.298 The remainin g studies used other methods comprising a systematic review of in silico methods,134 non-systematic reviews44,120,152,162,188,205,299,300 and opinion pieces .125,199,200,222,301 The top level of evidence was from the studies that used meta -analyses of gene expression profile datasets in rela tion cell pentobarbital, vorinostat (WT -171) potential inhibitors of SARS -CoV-2 Mpro.119 Inhibition of viral replication There are six stages involved in viral replication, which include attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly and release. Specifically , the replication and assembl y stage s differ depending upon the type of viral genome (i.e. RNA or DNA) . SARS -CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive sense, single stranded RNA virus . This RNA is used as a core template to produce both viral genomic RNA and mRNA. The latter of these instructs and directs the invaded host cell to produce and synthesise viral proteins and then to assemble the new virions. Firstly , once it has entered the host cell the viral capsid coat is removed by a series of enzymes, exposing the viral genomic material. Once exposed , the viral genomic material (RNA) enters various areas of the host cells (organelles, ribosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, etc .) and, via a process of protein synthesis (translation) , produces amino acid sequences . Then, peptides and proteins are assembled to deliver both structural an d non -structural proteins (enzymes) etc. New viral genomes are also produced by polymerase enzymes, which are then encased in newly produced viral capsid proteins and other protein components to form a new integral virus. This newly formed virus , with many more , is released from the host cell either by sudden rupture or extrusion over time.143 Forty -five studies identified drugs that may be effective in inhibiting viral replication.23,32,35,42,47,67,78,86,104,113,115,122,123,128,138,157,162,171,197,200,204,207,220 -222,224,247,283,293,302 -316 One study employed both in vivo and in vitro methods .104 Seven studies were in vitro ,32,35,36,47,67,78,86,115 while two were both in vitro and in silico.23,42 Seventeen used in silico methods , 113,123,157,171,207,247,283,293,303 -305,307 while another 17 another design.122,128,138,162,197,200,220 -222,224,302,306,312,313,315 -317 As both an in vivo and in vitro study, Weston 2020 provided the best level of evidence for this mechanism of action.104 The study authors identified clomipramine po tentially having being the most efficacious in terms of inhibiting SARS -CoV-2 viral replication.104 Inhibiting cytopathic response and immune system effects Page 19 of 60 SARS -CoV-2 creates plaque -like cytopathic effects in human airway epithelial (HAE) cells. These effects include cell fusion, cell death, destruction of epithelium integrity and cilium (hair) shrinking. Infection with SARS -CoV-2 virus (and many other viruses) has been shown to initiate a cytokine storm in some individuals . A cytokine storm is a recognised physiological and immunological reaction in which the individual's innate immune system produce s an exaggerated and uncontroll ed release of pro - inflammatory molecules termed cytokines, which , in the case of SARS -CoV-2, has led to organ damage. The major cytokines included in the release during a storm are interleukins 1 and 6 (IL -1, IL-6), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF -) and interferon. These cytokines serve to signal the influx of certain immune cells , (namely macrophages, neutrophils and T cells ) which , in turn , lead to inflammation and cell damage. Forty studies identified drugs targeting this mechanism of action. One stud y used in vivo methods only.100 Four studies used a purely in vitro design28,32,38,46 and in silico methods only were used by ten studies.123,163,171,172,285,318 -322 Mixed design s were used in in the following studies : Zhou 2020 a, who used a combination of in vivo, in vitro and in silico methods ;84 Chen 2020a and Jia 2020 , who both used in vitro and in silico methods .25,95 The remaining studies were of the following designs: o pinion piece ,118,144,158,199,200,323 -331 non-systematic review ,108,128,162,219,332,333 letter to the editor ,334 and Commentary.335 The top level of evidence was from the two studies that incorporated an in vivo design. The most effective drugs identified by the authors of these studies were imipenem (reported by Su 2020) and lapatinib ( reported by Zhou 2020 a).84,100 Page 20 of 60 Discussion Summary of results This review synthesised pre -clinical evidence identifying potential drug candidates for treating SARS - CoV-2. The results could be useful in highlighting therapeutic candidates to be evaluated in human clinical trials. Study author conclusions from the top level of evidence, assessed using DREL criteria, in relation to each MoA, suggests that the following drug candidates may be considered as potential treatment candidates: Prevention of viral entry into host cells -CoV-2 spike (S) protein -171), of into cells via the ACE2 receptor : topetecan Inhibition of viral replication -CoV-2: imipenem, lapatinib Much of the evidence for the above summary was generated from in silico studies. Two hundred and forty -two of the studies included in this review were solely in silico studies. As such , these candidate drugs likely need further pre -clinical assessment before asse ssment of their therapeutic activity within clinical trial. However, it is important to note that t he effectiveness of many candidate drugs already assessed within clinical trials has not reflected the promise of the collated pre -clinical data. Within this review t here were a greater proportion of studies identifying drugs that may inhibit SARS -CoV-2 main protease (Mpro ). Howev er, the best available evidence from in -vivo studies, identified drugs for preventing viral entry into cells via the ACE2 receptor ; inhibit ion of viral replication , and inhibition of the cytopathic effects of SARS -CoV-2. To be ef fective anti -viral medications identified in this report would need administration days after infection before the inflammatory immune response causes tissue damage. For many anti -viral drugs this is impractical especially where medication cannot be admini stered orally. The following identif ied points could also plausibly hinder the therapeutic value of candidate drugs identified : Poor bioavailability (the rate and extent to which a drug becomes available at its target site) ; Toxicity to humans at the dosag es required for effective treatment of SARS -CoV-2; A wide therapeutic index (the extent to which the drug has greater therapeutic than toxic effect s - potentially making chemotherapy drugs unsuitable for treating SARS -CoV-2 patients) ; risk of resistance (w here the body may stop responding to the treatment) and drug production costs . Page 21 of 60 Given the above points for consideration s ome of the drugs identified in th e report may be problematic for treating newly infected individuals and those with mild disease. For patients admitted to hospital with severe SARS -CoV-2, the anti -inflammatory drugs identified in this report may be appropriate; these could be administered via IV preparations and narrower thearapeutic index may be acceptable . Stren gths and limitations of this review As far as we are aware, this is the first overview of the development landscape of repurposed medications for SARS -CoV-2. Where possible, we endeavoured to conduct this review following best -practice systematic review principles. For example, we double -screened in a blinded manner at both title and abstract stage and at full-text stage to minimise selection bias, a step which is not adopted by up to 40% o f rapid reviews.336 However, due to the review's rapid nature, elements of best practice as would be utilised in a systematic review were omitted. We have been transparent about these and tried to indicate , when plausible , the impact this may have had on the findings. For the original review , it took nine weeks from the initial team meeting to sharing of the final report. The updated review begun in February 2021 also took nine weeks to complete. The bibliographic component of our search strategy was not abbreviated . However, due to time constraints, we chose not to search for grey literature beyond pre -print repositories and we did not perform reference or citation checking. Omitting these components of a non -abbreviated systematic searching strategy may have narrowed the scope of our identified records and resulted in some potentially relevant studies being missed. However, it has been suggested that abbreviated searches are a viable option for conducting rapid syntheses, with the caveat that reviews reliant on such searches may have less certainty in their overall r esults and face a small risk of making an incorrect conclusion .337 They indicate that abbreviated searches are more robust in reviews, such as ours, of pharmacological interventions and whi ch include 10 or more studies. The trajectory of the research surrounding SARS -CoV-2 is currently steep ; running the u pdated search in February 2021, five months after the original September 2020 search date, produced a further 1130 papers to screen and 267 included papers . Given th e topical nature of this research area, it is likely that further research has been published since completing th is review update . It is therefore, important to be aware that if new in vivo studies have been published the best candidates presented according to DREL may be outdated compared to those reported in this report. As double -blind screening during the original review was completed by reviewers and not topic experts , there is some possibility that eligible studies could have been excluded at title and abstract stage erroneously. For the initial version of this review, a member of the team with expertise in pharmacy and drug development (AW) assessed 10% of the 1 ,243 records screened at title and abstract stage during the original review , given the identified agreement between reviewers less than 7% of the excluded studies were likely to have been erroneously excluded. A small proportion of potentially eligible candidate drugs could have been missing from our original analy ses due to these records being erroneously excluded. However, for the updated review we assessed the full text of and subsequently Page 22 of 60 included 120 papers from the original search that did not appear to present any eligible drugs in the title and abstract . In addition, two reviewers with a background in pharmacy (SA and FZ) joined the full - text screening for the updated review. This has helped ensure that we have captured as much of the literature and as many of the candidate drugs as possible, when taken toget her with the original results and studies identified by the updated search. Data extraction was undertaken by a single reviewer, with a second reviewer checking a small sample of extracted data items for consistency. While this is not best practice follow ed in a full systematic review, double blind data extraction is a process often omitted from rapid reviews .336 The Cochrane Rapid Review Methods group recommend single data extraction with verification as a pragmatic approach when conducting a review of this nature .338 In the original review, we attempted to extract information regarding the adverse event profile, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs identi fied by each paper. However, data on these were sparse. Given this and the large amount of literature added to the updated review, we took a pragmatic decision not to extract these data for every new paper . However, one reviewer (EJ) extracted information regarding toxicity in relation to drugs from studies classified as representing the top level of evidence for each mechanism of action, where this information was reported (please see Appendix B). It was not possible to provide more detailed info rmation regarding the levels of toxicity or the likely side-effects of the drugs in this review, since th is would depend on the dosage when used in humans and this information was not reported in the preclinical studies included in this review . Consequently , the toxicity and acceptability of the potential candidate drugs identified in this review would need to be considered seperately . In addition, we did not actively se ek or extract information regarding the effects of the candidate drugs on specific varian ts of SARS -CoV-2 (e.g. the Kent or South African variants) . Included s tudies from the top level of evidence were screened for information regarding the effects of identified drugs on SARS -CoV-2, however, no relevant information was identified (please see appendix B). It is possible that that future publications will assess the effects of drugs on covid variants . In our original protocol we specified that we would assess risk of bias using the tool developed by the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) and the internal validity of in silico studies using a checklist developed to assess their methodological quality. We deviated from protocol by not implementing the OHAT tool or the checklist because we found they were not discriminating between studies. However, for rapid reviews , if the purpose is to scope available literature (akin to mapping preclinical research on SARS -CoV-2) rather than evaluate specific intervention effects, it is generally accepted tha t risk of bias assessment is not required. Although we did not assess each study for risk of bias, we did employ a modification of the DREL criteria to our analyses,18 grading drug repositioning candidates according to the level of scientific evidenc e available. This ensured that our main findings were focused on the best level of evidence available. Crucially, the results of this rapid review rely on the judgements made within studies by individual study authors. We used the study authors' conclusio ns to base our assessments of which studied candidate drugs were the most effective without harmonising , for example , the thresholds for binding or other pertinent parameters that authors were using to identify the most effective candidate drugs. This was a Page 23 of 60 pragmatic approach but does mean that the results should be interpreted with some caution and with the other 'less' effective candidate drugs indicated by study authors in mind. Conclusion This rapid review gives an overview of the current drug repositioning studies and level of evidence supporting individual drug candidates for the treatment of SARS -CoV-2 from hypoth esis driving studies through to in vivo studies. We identified 35 therapeutic agents with potentially promising therapeutic influence on SARS -CoV-2. These drug candidates were identified from four studies involving in vivo components to their design, 20 st udies involving in vitro components to their design, and one meta -analysis of in vitro studies. None of these therapeutics can be recommended for treatment without further well -designed preclinical and clinical research to establish their efficacy. We found no evidence for repurposed candidates to treat : pulmonary complications (dyspnoea, acute respiratory distress, lung injury, scarring, fibrosis); cardiovascular complications (e.g. oedema, hypertension, thrombus); other complications; or rehabilitation (f atigue, continual dyspnoea, cardiovascular abnormalities).
