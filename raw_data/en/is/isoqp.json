Sometimes you just need A LIST of what products and brands work well and can be trusted. Over the years, I've gotten several requests for a master list of my favorite brands. And though I've always felt like my entire site was a master list of recommendations, I know how important it can be just to have a go-to list of ideas and places that you know you can count on. So here's the list. It includes organic alternatives to everyday products we've used for years. It has non-toxic household cleaning products and the best in clean beauty. It's for you if you just need a list of natural products that you can count on. It has a lot of the brands I love and trust but it isn't a 100% comprehensive list \u2014 at all. Be sure to search the site for details and specific product recommendations where I go into detail and give you more options than could be listed on here. But this list will give you some of my favorites, at a glance. And it also covers topics that aren't yet written up on the site. So that's a win! It's called \"The Gentle List\" because not every product or brand on here is strictly non-toxic, but these are mostly cleaner brands in their respective categories. For the most part, these are brands I have used, know, and recommend based on my own experience or reliable research. And you know I try to choose clean products whenever possible. So browse the list in each of the categories below and check out my recommendations. This article contains affiliate links.

Cleaning When it comes to cleaning your home, keep it simple and use natural products whenever possible. Toss out the bleach and avoid any products that contain \"fragrance\" or \"parfum\", colored dyes, and sulfates. Keep your home clean but not overly sanitary; over-sanitizing is unhealthy too. with a good vacuum; preferably one with a HEPA filter. Steam mops can sanitize your floors using only water \u2014 no other ingredients needed. Laundry Keep your laundry fresh and clean with natural detergents that actually work (see the list below or my guide to [baby-safe laundry detergent](https://www.gentlenursery.com/baby-care/baby-safe-laundry-detergent/)). And can I let you in on a little secret? You don't need to use anything in the dryer. Not even dryer balls, though they are great if you prefer to use them.
