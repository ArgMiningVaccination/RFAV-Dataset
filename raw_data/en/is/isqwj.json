Here it means tools and skills for thinking clearly and reasoning well. Some of these skills are analytic: understanding, representing, and using patterns and methods of reasoning. Other skills are evaluative: j udging the quality of that reasoning. This course is about how to think and understand others' thinking, not what to think. It will not give you a bunch of facts to memorize, and the exams will mostly not test you on facts. Facts matter! The ultimate purp ose of clear thinking and good reasoning is to find, understand, and communicate truth. But our goal is to develop thinking skills you can use to get true beliefs and avoid false ones, in all areas of your life. We'll always need some true beliefs to begi n with. If we start with too many false beliefs, reasoning skills alone will not be enough. But if we care about truth and are willing to learn about the world so that we have some facts to reason with, the tools of critical thinking are very powerful. Developing them requires hard work , but it's worth the effort . These tools empower us to better understand the world around us, to recognize when we should change our beliefs, to find and criticize errors in reasoning, and to clearly organize, express, and de fend our thoughts. So get ready to think! Vocabulary : Important terms appear in bold when they are first introduced and defined in the text. Examples : The examples and practice questions throughout this text use a mix of t rue, false, and completely made -up claims and numbers. Their only purpose is to help explain the concepts. - 4 - ~ 1 ~ -ARGUMENTS - Several units in this course develop the critical thinking skills of reading, writing, and evaluating arguments , so a general overview of arguments is a good place to begin. i. -STATEMENTS - To understand what an argument is, we need the more basic concept of a statement . Three Types of Sentence s Here are two types of sentence s: question (asking for information ); command (telling someone to do something ). Question 1.1: Why did the Maya civilization decline ? Command 1.2: Walk backwards with your eyes closed . A third type of sentence is a statement . It assert s (says) that something is a fact . Statement 1.3: There are twelve continents . Statement 1.4 : Airplane business class seating is nicer than economy seating. Every s tatement has a truth value : either true or false. This makes statements different from questions and commands , which are neither true nor false. Compare these sentences: It's true that why did the Maya civilization decline . [It's true that QUESTION.] It's true that walk backwards with your eyes closed . [It's true that COMMAND.] It's true that there are twelve continents . [It's true that STATEMENT.] Only the last sentenc e makes sense because only the statement has a truth value (false) . - 5 - ii. -ARGUMENTS - We often hear that two people \" had an argument\" or that someone \"won an argument\" . In ordinary language , an argument is a dispute or disagreement . However for us, an a rgument is not a dispute , and it's not something that anyone wins or loses. An argument is a set of statements : one or more premise statements given as support for ( reason s to believe ) a conclusion statement . The conclusion may be anywhere in the argument . The conclusion is underlined in Arguments 1. 5-1.6. Argument 1.5: Flying in an airplane is more dangerous than riding in a car since airplanes fly 12 km up in the sky whereas cars stay on the ground. Argument 1.6: The deat h penalty is very cruel and does not prevent crimes , so it should be abolished . To make a n inference is to reason from premises to a conclusion . There are many words and phrase s - inference indicator s - that help us notice an inference. Argument 1.5 says \"[Conclusion] since [Premise]\" ; Argument 1.6 says \"[Premises] so [Conclusion]\". There are many others , such as because , consequently , therefore , and for that reason . Some arguments have no inference indicator. Argument 1 .7: Social networks (such as Facebook) are where most citizens get their news now. They should be controlled by laws ensuring the accuracy of news stories . The premise \"Social networks are where most citizens... \" supports t he conclusion \"They should be controlled ...\". Vocabulary : Of course the words so and since have other meanings besides indicat ing inferences. E.g. so also mean s \"this much\" or \"very\" ; since also mean s \"from that time until now\" . - 6 - iii. -RECONSTRUCTING ARGUMENTS - Standard Form Writing an argument in standard form puts its premises above a line and its conclusion below. We can reconstruct an argument by reading (or hearing) it carefully and putting it in standard form. Argument 1.8: The price of gold will go up soon, since investors are getting nervous about the market . They usually sell stocks and buy gold when they get nervous. Argument 1.8 (standard form) : Investors are getting nervous about the market. Investors usually sell stocks and buy gold when they get nervous about the market. The price of gold will go up soon. Argument 1. 9 is the same argument as Argument 1.8 but includes some extra information . These statements may introduce or elaborate on statements in the argument. They are neither premises nor conclusions and should be left out of the standard form reconstruction. Argument 1.9: Even though the price of gold is already nearly as high as it has ever been, it will go up soon, since investors are getting nervous about the stock market. They usually sell stocks and buy gold when they get nervous. People seem to believe that just because gold is shiny, it is a safe investment. - 7 - Implicit Statements People often do not say everything they think when giving an argument. A statement that someone thinks of as part of their argument, but does not write or speak, is implici t. Argument 1.10: We can 't save him now . He hasn't had a heartbeat for 5 minutes. There is a premise in Argument 1.10 that is not stated. Its exact wording and meaning are not completely clear, but the general idea is clear enough. It must be something like: No one who hasn't had a heartbeat for 5 minutes can be saved. If someone hasn't had a heart beat for 5 minutes then they cannot be saved. Very few people who haven't had a heartbeat for 5 minutes can be saved. If someone's had no heartbeat for 5 minutes then it's very unlikely they can be saved. Some such statement must be part of the sp eaker's meaning in Argument 1.10. It's implicit. Extended A rgument s An extended argument has a main argument with a final conclusion , and at least one sub- argument . The sub -argument has an intermediate conclusion , which is a premise in the main argument. Starting in Unit 4, t o make reconstruction s efficient, we'll use statement numbers ( , , etc.) for premises, conclusions, and extra information . Argument 1.11: We should buy gold. It's a good investment , since everything shiny is a good investment, and gold is very shiny. And we should buy it if it's a good investment. Main Argument Sub-argument - 8 - iv. -EVALUATING ARGUMENTS - To evaluate an argument is to judge its value , to say whether it is good or bad. We ask two questions : 1) Are the premises true? 2) Do the premises support the conclusion ? With a good argument, we can answer Yes to both questions. We'll do this a bit in Units 2 -3 and more in Units 8 -10. Are the p remises true? Argument 1.12 : All paintings are by Picasso, and Guernica (1937) is a painting. Hence Guernica is by Picasso. (Image: Wikimedia) The premises of Argument 1.12 support its conclusion. But its first premise is not true: not all paintings are by Picasso . So it is a bad argument (even t hough the conclusion is true) . Do the premises su pport the conclusion ? Premises support the conclusion when : If the premises are true, they are a reason to believe the conclusion. Argument 1. 13: All Winter Olympics have skiing events , and the 2018 Olympics in PyeongChang , Korea, had skiing events . Therefore the 20 18 Olympi cs was a Winter Olympics . The premises of Argument 1.13 are true. But its premises do not support its conclusion . So it 's a bad argument (even though the conclusion is true). Perhaps you aren't sure that A rgument 1.13 is bad in this way. Or perhaps you are sure but you're not sure how to show or explain it. That's fine. Unit 2 covers this kind of argument. There we'll learn some tools for analyzing and evaluating arguments like this one. - 9 - Do we know any r elevant background information ? We'll call an argument good if it has true premises that support its co nclusion. But knowing that an argument is good does not automatically make it rational to believe its conclusion. This is because support does not always mean guarantee . In some cases it does. We'll look at arguments like that (deductive) in Units 2 -3. In other cases it does not. We'll look at those other types of arguments in Unit s 4 and 8 -10. With these arguments , it can be very important to consider background information in additio n to the premises . - 10 - -UNIT 1 SKILLS - You must be able to : Recognize and write examples of questions, commands, and statements . Identify inference indicators, conclusion s, and premises in an argument. Reconstruct an argument in standard form. - 11 - -QUICK TEST QUESTIONS - 1) The conclusion of an argument... a) ...briefly summarizes the premises. b) ...is supported by one or more premises. c) ...supports one or more premises. d) ...comes at the end of an argument. 2) How is an argument written in standard form? a) It uses a standard inference indicator such as because . b) It's written in a form that meets a very high standard. c) It's written as a paragraph with the conclusion stated clearly. d) The premises are writ ten above a line with the conclusion below it. 3) An implicit statement is... a) ...part of the argument and is written. b) ...not part of the argument but is written. c) ...not part of the argument and is not written . d) ...part of the argument but is not written . 4) An extended argument always contains... a) ...an intermediate conclusion and a final conclusion . b) ...an intermediate conclusion and a final premise. c) ...an implicit premise and an intermediate conclusion. d) ...an intermediate premise and a final premise . 5) To evaluate an argument is to judge whether... a) ...its conclusion is true or false. b) ...the argument is true or false. c) ...the argument is good or bad. d) ...its conclusion is good or bad. 6) Which things are true or false? a) Premises and arguments; not conclusions. b) Premises and conclusions; not a rguments. c) Premises, conclusions, and arguments. d) Arguments and conclusions; not premises. 7) What are the features of a good argument? a) The premises are true; the conclusion is true. b) The argument is true; the premises support the conclusion. c) The premises are true; the premises support the conclusion. d) The conclusion is true; the conclusion supports the premises.- 12 - -PRACTICE QUESTIONS - 1) Is the sentence a question, a command, or a statem ent? a) Every person who's gone to the Moon was a woman. b) Please fly me to the Moon. c) We should send humans to Mars instead of the Moon. d) Could humans live on Mars without getting bored? e) Why does the Moon have craters on it? f) Humans first landed on the Moon in 1785. g) Stop spending money on stupid things like sending humans to the Moon. h) The volcano near our city might explode this year. i) You are allowed to use your phone during the exam. j) Why does our instructor always have a headache? k) Quickly hand me the screwdrive r that fits these screws. l) The deepest part of the ocean is in English Bay, Vancouver. m) Just get rid of that gross leftover take -out food in the refrigerator. n) How does a representative democracy like Canada work? o) The end of the Bronze Age may have been cause d by climate change. 2) Identify the conclusion and inference indicator s if there are any . a) College courses could be taught by robots instead of humans. Robots can click PowerPoint slides and mark multiple choice exams just as well as humans can. b) Since cheetahs are beautiful wild animals that belong in their home in Africa, it would be good to have better enforcement of the laws that prohibit capturing them for pets. c) It would be better for people to use transit instead of driving . Just consider the fact that, with millions of cars on the road, no one can get where they're going anyway . d) Obviously K2 is a more challenging climb than Mount Everest. Serious mountain climbers admire people who climb K2 more than they admire people who climb Mount Everest. e) The Parthenon Marbles in the British Museum were taken from Greece in the 19th century, and now Greece wants them back, so Britain has no right to keep them. f) The IUD (Intrauterine Device) is the most reliable form of contraception [birth control]. As well as having a low failure rate, IUDs don't depend on women taking a pill every day. g) In our society there are millions of \"soft\" (unprotected) targets for terrorists who are willing to die in an attack; consequently we cannot stop terrorism without restrictin g people's freedoms. h) In 2009 , the cable news channels reported a crazy , false story about a little boy who floated away in a homemade balloon. The people at the cable news channels are idiots. - 13 - i) Earth is only about 10,000 years old. The Bible says so, and th e Bible was written by the creator of the universe. j) If the new guy is working today, some customer will get their order screwed up . And a customer did get their order screwed up. So the new guy is working today. k) Taxes are really just a kind of theft: the government robs people of their money and calls it a tax so that it doesn't sound so bad. That's why tax ation is wrong. l) Sending humans to explore Mars would be far more expensive than sending robots. Unlike robots, humans need protection from the cold vacuum [lack of air] and dangerous radiation of outer space , and a spaceship that can do that would cost a lot. m) Buddy's Pizza and Bobby's Pizza are both cheap, greasy pizza restaurants, a nd Buddy's pizzas are gross. Therefore Bobby's pizzas will be gross, too. n) Sending humans to explore other planets would be very expensive, and most of that money would be spent on machines and equipment whose only purpose is to keep the humans alive. So we should send robots to explore outer space instead, as they can take photographs and do science experiments without the air, food, and warmth tha t humans need . o) Since the American government is evil and wanted an excuse to invade Iraq for its oil, probably it planned the 2001 World Trade Center attack and made it look as though terrorists did it. p) Canada's economy will be affected by a drop in oil prices due to the fact that Canada exports oil from the tar sands of Alberta, and it is so expensive to extract oil from tar sands that it is profitable only if the price of oil i s high. q) Even though they come to the surface for air to breathe, whales h ave fins and tails for swimming and live their whole lives in the ocean , and anything that swims and lives in the ocean is a fish. It follows that whales are fish. r) Those herbs that my friend gave me must have cured my arthritis [joint pain] . The proof is that my arthritis went away shortly after I started eating them every day. - 14 - -ANSWER KEY - QUICK TEST 1) b 2) d 3) d 4) a 5) c 6) b 7) c 1) a) Statement b) Command c) Statement d) Question e) Question f) Statement g) Command h) Statement i) Statement j) Question k) Command l) Statement m) Command n) Question o) Statement 2) Conclusion is underlined ; inference indicator is bold. a) College courses could be taught by robots instead of humans .

We'll picture it as a container , a circle. To show that an individual thing is a member of the category (an item of that type) , we'll show the individual inside the circle . We'll label categories with A, B, etc. and an individual thing with X. With these symbols we'll show the statement pattern . On the right we'll show a category diagra m. Statement 2.1: The Halifax Explosion (1917) was a disaster. Pattern : X is an A. A: Disasters X X: The Halifax Explosion Statement 2.2: Wednesday is not a month. (Wednesday is a Non-month.) Pattern : X is not an A. X (X is a Non-A.) A: Months X: Wednesday The X means \"something exists here\". A category may or may not have any members. Disasters and Months have many members not shown in the diagrams . And some categories are empty. There is no X we could truthfully draw in their circle. For example, the categ ory Canadian $3 Bills has no members. The diagrams are called Euler diagrams. This and the following sections present a simplified version of the category logic taught in a formal logic course. Several things are omitted or simplified to help us focus on just a few important skills. Disasters Months - 17 - Universal Generalizations A universal generalization relates two categor ies; universal means \"not e ven one exception \". We'll use t he universal quantifier s All, Only, and No, plus alternative s such as Every and None that function logically as All and No. Universal Generalization [Universal Quantifier] A are B. In this statement pattern, A is the subject category and B is the predicate category . The categories are written as nouns (things) . Here are a few examples. Statement 2 .3: All bacteria cause disease . Pattern : All A are B. A: Bacteria B: Things that Cause Disease / Disease -Causer s Statement 2. 4: Only birds fly. Pattern : Only A are B. A: Birds B: Flying Animals Statement 2. 5: No cities have more than 1 0 million people . Pattern : No A are B. A: Cities B: Places with More than 1 0 Million People Statement 2. 3 shows that often there is more than one w ay to write a category label. Statement 2. 4 shows that we must use common sense in thinking of the appropriate categor y. Common sense tells us that Statement 2. 4 is probably not referring to Flying Things or Fliers generally. Probably it's discussing animals , so its predicate category is Flying Animals. Disease - Causers Bacteria Cities Places with More than 10 Million People Birds Flying Animals - 18 - Logical Equivalence When two categorical statements are logically equivalent , they have exactly the same categories diagram . Since they give the same \"picture\" of the world, it's impossible for one to be true and the other false. Either they are both true or they are both false. An All statement can be converted into a logically equivalent Only statement , with a single diagram. Statement 2. 3: All Bacteria are Disease -Causers . Only Disease -Causers are Bacteria . Pattern : All A are B. Only B are A. A: Bacteria B: Disease -Causers An All... statement can also be converted into a logically equivalent No... statement. The No quantifier applies to regions that are separated from each other. This diagram shows: Bacteria is separated from Non-(Disease -Causers) . Statement 2. 3: All Bacteria are Disease -Causers ) No Bacteria are Non -(Disease -Causers) . Pattern : All A are B. No A are Non -B. Since we can convert All... to No..., we can also convert No... to All.... Statement 2. 5: No Cities are Places with More than 10 million People. All Cities are Non -(Places with More than 10 million People). Pattern : No A are B. All A are Non -B. A: Cities B: Places with More than 10 Million People Disease - Causers Bacteria Disease - Causers Bacteria Cities Places with More than 10 Million People - 19 - Logically Equivalent Universal Generalization s An All statement can also be combined with a different (non -logically equivalent) Only statement . The combined statements have a combined diagram. Statement 2.3 : All bacteria cause disease . Pattern : All A are B. A: Bacteria B: Disease -Cause rs + + Statement 2.6 : Only bacteria cause disease . Pattern : Only A are B. = = Statement 2. 7: All and only bacteria cause disease . Pattern : All and only A are B. All and only ... says that t he two categories perfectly overlap. They contain exactly the same things. All A are B. Only B are A. No A are Non -B. No A are B. All A are Non -B. Only Non -B are A. Bacteria B A A B Bacteria Disease - Causers Disease - Causers Disease - Causers Bacteria - 20 - ii. -DEDUCTIVE ARGUMENTS - Logic is the study and use of a family of arguments called deductive arguments . Deductive arguments are supposed to be valid. The premises of a valid argument support the conclusion perfectly: they absolutely guarantee it . A valid argument is truth -preserving: If we put truth \"in\" (the premises are true), we get truth \"out\" (the conclusion is true). This special quality means that it's impossible for a valid argument to have true premises and a false conclusion. Since different statements can have the same pattern, different argum ents can have the same pattern. Here's a n example valid argument pattern and two arguments that both have this same pattern. All A are B. X is an A. Therefore X is a B. Argument 2. 8 (VALID) : All disasters are earthquakes. The Halifax Explosion was a disaster. Therefore the Halifax Explosion was an earthquake. A: Disasters B: Earthquakes X: The Halifax Explosion Argument 2. 9 (VALID) : All bacteria cause disease. SARS -CoV-2 is a bacterium. Therefore SARS -CoV-2 causes disease. A: Bacteria B: Disease -Causers X: SARS -CoV-2 Arguments 2.8 and 2.9 have different statements but the same pattern. Since that argument pattern is valid, both arguments are valid. (In the next section, we'll see why the pattern is valid.) These arguments contain several false statements. Validity does not mean that the premises or the conclusion are tr ue! It means: if the premises are true, the conclusion definitely is true. Short deductive arguments like Argument s 2.8 and 2.9 are often called syllogisms . In th e next section we'll look at some different syllogisms that have a universal generalization premise. Vocabulary : In ordinary language, valid has other meanings: true, relevant, important, etc. A scientific test is valid if it measures what it's supposed to measure. Deductive validity is different from all of these. - 21 - iii. -CATEGORICAL S YLLOGISMS - Argument Patterns with All Here is a valid pattern and a similar but invalid pattern ( logical fallacy ), with examples below. All A are B. X is an A. X is a B. All A are B. X is a B. X is an A. VALID INVALID Argument 2.1 0 (VALID) : All disasters are earthquakes. The Halifax Explosion was a disaster. Therefore the Halifax Explosion was an earthquake. A: Disasters B: Earthquakes X: The Halifax Explosion We can see in the diagram why Argument 2.10 is valid: If the premises are true (Halifax Explosion (X) inside Disasters), the conclusion must be true (X inside Earthquakes). Argument 2.1 1 (INVALID) : Every restaurant is profitable. McDonald's is profitable. Therefore McDonald's is a restaurant. A: Restaurants B: Profitable Businesses X: McDonald's We can see in the diagram why Argument 2.11 is invalid: Even if the premises are true (McDonald's (X) inside Profitable Businesses), the conclusion could be false (X outside Restaurants). Earthquakes Disasters X Profitable Businesses X Restaurants - 22 - More Argument Patterns with All Here is another valid pattern and a similar but invalid pattern, with examples below. All A are B. X is not an A. X is not a B. All A are B. X is not a B. X is not an A. INVALID VALID Argument 2.1 2 (VALID) : All bacteria cause disease. Yersinia pestis does not cause disease. Therefore Yersinia pestis is not a bacterium. X A: Bacteria B: Disease -Causers X: Yersinia pestis We can see in the diagram why Argument 2.12 is valid: If the premises are true ( Yersinia pestis (X) outside Disease -Causers), the conclusion must be true (X outside Bacteria). Argument 2.1 3 (INVALID) : All great films depict superheroes. Seven Samurai is not a great film. Therefore Seven Samurai does not depict superheroes. A: Great Films B: Superhero Depictions X: Seven Samurai We can see in the diagram why Argument 2.13 is invalid: Even if the premises are true ( Seven Samurai (X) outside Great Films), the conclusion could be false (X inside Super hero Depictions). Disease - Causers Bacteria Superhero Depictions X Great Films (Image: Criterion Collection) - 23 - Argument Patterns with No Here are two valid patterns and two similar but invalid patterns, with examples below. No A are B. X is an A. X is not a B. No A are B. X is a B. X is not an A. No A are B. X is not an A. X is a B. No A are B. X is not a B. X is a n A. VALID VALID INVALID INVALID Argument 2.1 4 (VALID) : No medieval inventions changed the world. The mechanical clock changed the world. Therefore the mechanical clock wasn't a medieval invention. A: Medieval Inventions B: World -Changing Inventions X: The mechanical clock We can see in the diagram why Argument 2.14 is valid: If the premises are true (the mechanical clock (X) inside World -Chang ing Inventions), the conclusion must be true (X outside Medieval Inventions ). Argument 2.1 5 (INVALID) : Nothing worth doing is easy. Juggling chainsaws is not easy. Therefore juggling chainsaws is worth doing. A: Things Worth Doing X B: Easy Things X: Jugglin g chainsaws We can see in the diagram why Argument 2.15 is invalid: If the premises are true ( juggling chainsaws (X) outside Easy Things), the conclusion could be false (X outside Things Worth Doing) . Medieval Inventions World - Changing Inventions X Things Worth Doing X Easy Things - 24 - iv. -COUNTEREXAMPLES - A universal generalization is false if there is even one exception to it. (A true universal generalization has no exceptions.) An exception to a generalization is called a counterexample . With two categorie s, anything in the world has one of four possible descriptions. But the categories diagram for a universal generalization has only three regions. A counterexample is something that doesn't fit into th at diagram. It has th e one description that has no corre sponding region in the diagram. If this thing exists, the generalization is false (the diagram is wrong) . Counterexampl e to: All A are B. Only A are B. B. Non-B X4 B A B B A - 25 - Case #1: \"Only birds fly.\" Statement 2. 4: Only Birds are Flying Animals . Pattern : Only A are B. A: Birds B: Flying Animals Statement 2. 4 is false. A counterexample is a bat (a Flying Animal but not a Bird ). A bat (X) doesn't fit into the statement's diagram. It must be corrected. We can write this with Not only or with the Some quantifier. Correction Diagram Counterexample (X): a bat Counterexample Description : [Non -A] Animal [B] A bat shows that: Statement 2. 16: Not only Birds are Flying Animals. Some Flying Animals are Non -Birds. Pattern : Not only A are B. Some B are Non -A. Bird Flying Animal Bird Non-(Flying Animal ) Non-Bird Flying Animal X: Non-Bird Non-(Flying Animal ) Birds Flying Animals Flying Animals X Birds - 26 - Before looking at Case #2, let's see how nothing with any of the other three possible descri ptions is a counterexample to \"Only birds fly.\" What about an owl? No, an owl has the wrong description: a Flying Animal but also a Bird. It fits into the diagram. X What about a penguin? No, a penguin has the wrong description: a Bird but not a Flying Animal. It fits into the diagram. X Bird Flying Animal X: Bird Non-(Flying Animal ) Non-Bird Flying Animal Non-Bird Non-Bird Flying Animal Non-Bird Non-(Flying Animal ) Birds Birds Flying Animals Flying Animals - 27 - What about a rock? No, a rock has the wrong description: not a Bird and also not a Flying Animal. It fits into the diagram. X What about a dragon, a giant, flying lizard? A dragon has the right description: a Flying Animal but not a Bird. It would be a counterexample because it would not fit into the diagram . But it doesn't exist (it's mythical) .

In the disagreement pattern below, Abby and Bob agree that X is not a B. Since Abby is most sure that all A are B (her Premise 2), she concludes that X is not an A. Since Bob is most sure that X is A (his Premise 2), he concludes that not all A are B. Bob thinks X is a counterexample; Abby disagrees. Abby and Bob (agre eing) [Premise 1] X is not a B. Abby (disagreeing) Bob (disagreeing) [Premise 2 ] All A are B. [Premise 2 ] X is an A. [Conclusion ] X is not an A. [Conclusion ] Not all A are B. Here's a serious example of this type of disagreement involving a controversial concept: terrorism . In 2017 the worst American mass shooting to date happened in Las Vegas. As far as anyone knows, the gunman had no political or religious motive. A disagreement may begin with agreement on that fact.

[Some A are not B.] Original Generalization Correct ion (including X) X Explanation (not required for exam answer ) The predicate begins on the verb begin . The predicate category could be more specific than Things that Begin..., e.g. Illnesses that Begin.... Anything that could reasonably be described the same way as this counterexample would be correct.

A diagram showing complete separation is also correct. Mental Illnesses [A] Things that Begin During a Person's Teenage Years [B] Mental Illnesses [A] Things that Begin During a Person's Teenage Years [B] - 54 - ~ 3 ~ -STATEMENT LOGIC - i. -LOGICAL OPERATORS - Simple statement s (represented b y letters: P, Q, etc.) may be modified or connected with a logical operator , which attaches to the statements and \"operates\" on their truth values . This forms a new statement whose truth value is determined by the truth value(s) of the simple statement(s) . For example, if P is true, its negation \u00acP is false; if P is false, its negation \u00acP is true. P is logically equivalent to the negat ion of its negation: P \u00ac\u00acP. Negation \u00acP Says: NOT P (P is false. ) The conjunction and disjunction operators create conjunction and disjunction statements , compound statements that connect two simple statements. Conjunction P-AND-Q Says: BOTH P and Q are true. Disjunction Inclusive Exclusive P-OR-Q P-XOR-Q Says: AT LEAST ONE of P and Q is true. Says: EXACTLY ONE of P and Q is true. A four-line truth table shows the four possible truth value combinations for two simple statements . Along each line, it shows the resulting truth values of negation, conjunction, and the disjunctions . P Q \u00acP P-AND-Q P-OR-Q P-XOR-Q 1 True True False True True False 2 True False False False True True 3 False True True False True True 4 False False True False False False Our way of writing the operators is not standard because it mixes two different symbol systems. We'll use the logical symbol \u00ac (instead of NOT) because it's short and con venient. We'll use AND and OR (instead of and ) because they're clearer to people who are seeing logic for the first time. - 55 - Conjunction 3.1: Flowering plants are pollinated by flying insects and by pixies . Pattern: P-AND-Q P: Flowering plants are pollinated by flying insects. Q: Flowering plants are pollinated by pixies. Disjunction 3.2: Flowering plants are pollinated by by pixies . Pattern: P-OR-Q (Image: depositphotos.com) Conjunction 3.1 is false since only one, not both , of the statements is true. Disjunction 3.2 is true since at least one statement is true. The word and means AND , as do other words such as but and although . Words in other languages also mean AND: et (French), y (Spanish), (Mandarin), v\u00e0 (Vietnamese), (Punjabi), etc. In some cases it's not clear whether t he word or means OR or XOR. We'll read disjunctions in ordinary language as OR, and w e'll mainly use this inclusive disjunction . De Morgan's Laws De Morgan's Laws are a pair of logical equivalence rules for false compound statement s: false AND and false O R. We can see the two rules by looking in the truth table where AND and OR are false. P Q P-AND-Q P-OR-Q 1 True True True True 2 True False False True 3 False True False True 4 False False False False P-AND-Q is false on lines 2 -4. These lines are where Q is false (2) or P is false (3) or both P and Q are false (4). Therefore : \u00ac(P-AND-Q) (\u00acP)-OR-(\u00acQ) P-OR-Q is false on line 4. That line is where both P and Q are false. Therefore : \u00ac(P-OR-Q) (\u00acP)-AND-(\u00acQ) - 56 - Logical Equivalence 3.3: Flowering plants are not pollinated by flying insects and by pixies. Flowering plants are not pollinated by flying insects or they're not pollinated by pixies . Pattern: \u00ac(P-AND-Q) (\u00acP)-OR-(\u00acQ) P: Flowering plants are pollinated by flying insects. Q: Flowering plants are pollinated by pixies. Logical Equivalence 3.4: Flowering plants are not pollinated by flying insects or by pixies. Flowering plants are not pollinated by flying insects and they're not pollinated by pixies . Pattern: \u00ac(P-OR-Q) (\u00acP)-AND-(\u00acQ) - - In a disjunctive syllogism , one premise says that one of two disjunct s is true, and the other premise denies that one of them is true . The conclusion is that the other is true. Disjunctive Syllogism (DS) P-OR-Q \u00acP Q Argument 3.5 (VALID) : Insulin (a hormone that allows the body to use sugar for energy) is released into the bloodstream from the kidneys or from the liver. But it does n't come from the liver . Therefore it certainly come s from the kidneys. (Image: NIDDK) To evaluate this argument as valid or invalid, we need to see its pattern. We can show the pattern using letters we assign to its simple statements and the disjunction and negation operators . Simple Statements Argument 3.3 Pattern P: Insulin is from the kidneys. Q: Insulin is from the liver. P-OR-Q \u00acQ P VALID (DS) The argument has a false conclusion (insulin comes from the pancreas) even though it' s valid. That 's possible because it has a false premis e. (The premise P-OR-Q is false because both P and Q are false. ) Does the disjunction in Argument 3. 5 seem exclusive (XOR) or inclusive (OR) to you ? Ordinary language often doesn't make this clear. But for DS arguments such as Argument 3. 5, it doesn 't matter. Both types of disjunction say \"one of these two statements is true\" . So if one is false, the other is true. DS is always valid. - 58 - iii. -CONDITIONAL - A conditional is an If...then... compound statement . Unlike conjunction and disjunction, the truth value of a conditional is not determined by the truth values of the statements within it . A conditional is true when the truth of its antecedent statement is sufficient for (guarantee s) the truth of its consequent , and the truth of its consequent is necessary (required) for the truth of its antecedent. Conditional If [Antecedent ] then [Consequent]. Says: [Antecedent ] for [Consequent]. [Consequent] necessary for [Antecedent ]. Conditional 3.6: If whales are fish then they can breathe underwater. Pattern : If P then Q. P: Whales are fish. Q: Whales can breathe underwater. Often p eople put a question or command into an If...then... sentence instead of a consequent statement . A sentence like this can easily be re-written as a proper conditional . Conditional 3.7: If there are other technologically advanced beings in the galaxy then where are they? If there were other technologically advanced beings in the galaxy then we would have encountered them. Conditional 3.8: If you want to call yourself a male feminist , demand that your female colleagues be paid the same as you are paid. If you want to call yourself a male feminist , you should demand that your female colleagues be paid the same as you a re paid. In a course on formal symbolic logic, there is a logical operator for If...then.... This type of conditional works a bit differently from the one we've described here. (Image: bizjournals.com) - 59 - Writing Conditionals Conditionals are often expressed in one of t hree different forms . All three say: antecedent sufficient; consequent necessary. But they emphasize (stress) one part of this meaning more than the other . Conditional Form Emphasis If [Antecedent] then [Consequent]. Antecedent if [Antecedent]. only if [Consequent]. Consequent Necessary Conditional 3.9: Tennis was invented before golf if the ancient Egyptians played tennis . Pattern : P [Consequent] if Q [Antecedent]. P: Tennis was invented before golf. Q: The ancient Egyptians played tennis . Conditional 3.10: Bob will get his passport in time for his trip only if he pays the extra fee for fast processing. Pattern : P [Antecedent] only if Q [Consequent] P: Bob gets his passport. Q: Bob pays the fee. Only if in Conditional 3.10 emphasizes that paying the fee is necessary for Bob to get his passport. Sentences written with when instead of if also form conditionals. The logical meaning is the same . Unless An unless sentence is also a conditional. \" P unless Q\" says that P is true if Q is false : P if \u00acQ. Statement 3.11: You'll hurt yourself exercising unless you stretch first . You'll hurt yourself exercising if you do not stretch first . - 60 - iv. -CONDITIONAL ARGUMENTS - Hypothetical Syllogism A hypothetical syllogism has two conditional premises. These overlap on a simple statement that is antecedent in one conditional and consequent in the other. The conclusion is the conditional we get by cutting out the overlapping simple statement. Hypothetical Syllogism (HS) If P then Q. If Q then R. If P then R. Argument 3.1 2: There will be a huge oil spill if that oil tanker crashes, and if there's a huge oil spill then many of the animals that live in this area will not survive. Therefore many of the animals that live in this area will not survive if that oil tanker crashes . Simple Statements Argument 3.1 2 Pattern P: That oil t anker crashes. Q: The a nimals will survive. R: There is a huge o il spill. R if P. If R then \u00acQ. \u00acQ if P. VALID (HS) - 61 - Affirming Antecedent (AA) and the AC Fallacy \"If P then Q\" says P is sufficient for Q. It does not say Q is sufficient for P. This means that: Affirm ing Antecedent (AA) Affirm ing Consequent (AC) If P then Q. P Q If P then Q. Q P VALID INVALID (Fallacy) (Image: Food & Beverage Insider) Argument 3.13 (AA): If food prices rise, people will riot . And food prices are rising. Therefore people will riot. Argument 3.14 (AC Fallacy) : People riot when food prices rise. And p eople are rioting . Therefore food prices have risen. (Image: Nosyrevy) Simple Statements Argument 3.13 Pattern Argument 3.14 Pattern P: Food prices rise. Q: People riot. If P then Q. P Q Q if P. Q P VALID (AA) INVALID (AC) Argument 3.14 is a logical fallacy ; it is invalid because its conclusion could be false even when its premises are true. For example, perhaps there's a riot because a local sports team lost a big game instead of food prices. The traditional Latin name for Affirming Antecedent, used in most logic courses, is modus ponens . - 62 - Denying Consequent (DC) and the DA Fallacy \"If P then Q\" says Q is necessary for P. It does not say P is necessary for Q. This means that: Denying Antecedent (DA) Deny ing Consequent (DC) If P then Q. \u00acP \u00acQ If P then Q. \u00acQ \u00acP INVALID (Fallacy) VALID Argument 3.15 (DC): Recreational use of MDMA (Ecstasy) would be legal unless the public believe d that it's a sign of bad personal character. But MDMA is not legal. Therefore the public does believe that. (Image: South Park) Argument 3.16 (DA Fallacy) : Recreational use of MDMA w ould be legal only if the public did n't believe that it's a sign of bad personal character . And MDMA is not legal. Therefore the public does believe that . Simple Statements Argument 3.15 Pattern Argument 3.16 Pattern P: Recreational MDMA is legal. Q: Public believes MDMA is sign of bad character . P if \u00acQ. \u00acP Q P only if \u00acQ. \u00acP Q VALID (DC) INVALID (DA) Argument 3.16 is invalid because its conclusion could be false even when its premises are true. Perhaps the public doesn't believe that using MDMA is a sign of bad character even though it's illegal . The traditional Latin name for Denying Consequent, used in most logic courses, is modus tollens . - 63 - DC for Objections Bob says that eating mammals is morally OK. Abby disagrees . She objects t o (against) his statement with a DC argument . To make this argument, she needs a conditional with three features: 1) Bob's statement is the antecedent . 2) The whole conditional is true, so the condition al premise of the argument is true. 3) The consequent is false, so the DC premise of the argument is true. Objection against Eating mammals is morally OK only if they do not suffer in factory farms. False Consequent Following the DC pattern, Abby concludes that the antecedent (Bob's statement) is false. Argument 3.17: Eating mammals is morally OK only if they do not suffer in factory farms. But certainly they do suffer in factory farms. Therefore eating mammals is not morally OK. (Image: Animal Outlook) Simple Statements Argument 3.17 Pattern P: Eating mammals is OK. Q: Mammals suffer in factory farms . P only if \u00acQ. Q \u00acP VALID (DC) Abby's objection is a valid argument . If Bob continues to believe that eating mammals is morally OK, he must reject one of her premises. To reject the conditional premise , he must say that the moral OK- ness of eating mammals really does not require that they not suffer in factory farms. To reject the DC premis e, he must say that m ammals do not suffer in factory farms. - 64 - AC and DA in Everyday Language Once you are aware of the AC and DA patterns, you will notice them e verywhere. Argument 3.18 : I think o ur restaurant won't be able to stay in business. It would b e able to if customers took selfies that attracted their social media followers , but people just eat and talk and don't take selfies. Argument 3.18 has the pattern of an invalid DA fallacy . But th at may not be the most reasonable way to read it. It may have an implicit biconditional premise : \"Our restaurant would be able to stay in business if and only if customers took selfies that attracted their social media followers .\" Read this way, the argument is an implicit DC argument. Or the argument may not be deductive at all. It may not be intended as valid. The speaker may understand that the restaurant could possibly be able to stay in business even without customer selfies, but they think the lack of customer selfies makes it unlikely that it will . Similarly, many examples of the AC pattern in everyday language are not most reasonably read as invalid deductive arguments. They may have an implicit biconditional or they may be intended as a non-deductive pattern that we will learn in Unit 4. People do make logical errors ! But in these short examples with no context, it can be impossible to determine the most reasonable way to read an argument. So the questions in this unit ask you to construct and u se valid patterns, but not to identify invalid ones. - 65 - -UNIT 3 SKILLS - You must be able to : Recognize and write negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions.

Explanation (not required for exam answer) The given statement is a conjunction P-AND-Q. Its negation is logically equivalent to (\u00ac P)-OR- (\u00acQ). 2) Answer A candle is sufficient to read a (paper) book at nighttime. Explanation (not required for exam answer ) Under normal circumstances (e.g. the person can read, they are not blind), a candle would be enough (make it possible) to read a book at nighttime. But it's not required since there are other sources of light would make reading a book possible. 3) Answer [Premise 1 ] The president resign s only if the people do not still support her . [Premise 2 ] The president resign s. [Conclusion ] The people do not still support her. [AA] [Premise 2 ] The people do support the president still . [Conclusion ] She doesn't resign. [DC] Explanation (not required for exam answer ) Since the consequent \"The people do not still support the president\" already contains the NOT operator, its negation in Premise 2 (right argument) removes the word not. - 72 - The argument patterns are : P only if \u00acQ. P \u00acQ P only if \u00acQ. Q \u00acP P: President resigns. Q: People support the president . 4) Answers (examples) [Premise 1] If Netflix stops people from sharing passwords then we'll have to watch YouTube. [Premise 2] If Netflix profits go down then they will stop people from sharing passwords. [Conclusion] If Netflix profits go down then we'll have to watch YouTube. [Premise 1] If Netflix stops people from sharing passwords then we'll have to watch YouTube. [Premise 2] If we have to wa tch YouTube then we'll be forced to watch lots of ads. [Conclusion] If Netflix stops people from sharing passwords then we'll be forced to watch lots of ads. Explanation (not required for exam answer ) Since the given conditional Premise 1 contains two simple statements, an answer must contain a third simple statement to make an HS argument. In the first answer, Premise 2 connects with the antecedent of Premise 1 (\"Netflix stops people from sharing passw ords\"); in the second answer, Premise 2 connects with the consequent of Premise 1 (\"We'll have to watch YouTube\"). 5) Answers (examples) The revolution will succeed only if the government doesn't shut down the internet that revolutionaries use to coordinate their protests. The government is shutting down the internet that revolutionaries use to coordinate their protests. The revolution will not succeed. The political prisoners would have been released by now if the revolution had succeeded. The political prisoners still have not been released. The revolution failed . [see explanation below] - 73 - If the revolution were succeeding, the army would be joining with the protestors against the government. The army is not joining with the protestors ag ainst the government. The revolution is not succeeding. Explanation (not required for exam answer ) The argument is an objection to the statement \"The revolution succeeds\" , in the future, past, or present tense . For the DC argument pattern, this statement is the antecedent of the conditional premise. The conclusion denies this statement: The revolution does not succee d. This situation is imaginary, but it's reasonable to think the consequent might be necessary for the antecedent. (Note: Sometimes there is a word that clearly means the negation of another word. In the second answer here, fail simply means \"not succeed\". In cases like this where the meaning is completely clear, a correct answer can use a word substitution instead of adding or removing not.) - 74 - PRACTICE EXAM 2 1) Answer The movie will not be promoted heavily this fall and it will not be delayed a year. Explanation (not required for exam answer) The given statement is a disjunction P-OR-Q. Its negation is logically equivalent to (\u00ac P)-AND- (\u00acQ). 2) Answer Deathtrap nightclub's new hiring policy states that a first aid certificate is necessary for being employed at the club. Explanation (not required for exam answer ) It would be a very strange or desperate hiring policy that guaranteed a job to anyone at all who has a first aid certificate. At any normal nightclub, the certificate would not be sufficient for employment. It would be much more reasonable for the certific ate to be a requirement (necessary). 3) Answer [Premise 1 ] Either nuclear fusion is a viable energy source or civilization as we know it does not have a long future on Earth . [Premise 2] Nuclear fusion is not a viable energy source. [Conclusion ] Civilization as we know it does not have a long future on Earth. [Premise 2] Civilization as we know it has a long future on Earth. [Conclusion] Nuclear fusion is a viable energy source. - 75 - Explanation (not required for exam answer ) Since the disjunct \"Civilization as we know it does not have a long future on Earth\" already contains the NOT operator, its negation in the Conclusion (left argument) and Premise 2 (right argument) removes the word not. The argument patterns are: P OR \u00acQ. \u00acP \u00acQ P OR \u00acQ. Q P P: Nuclear fusion is viable. Q: Civilization has a long future. 4) Answer (example) [Premise 1] Bob isn't able to go near the window in his apartment if he's afraid of heights. [Premise 2] Bob will get a different apartment if he isn't able to go near the window in it. [Conclusion] Bob will get a different apartment if he's afraid of heights. Explanation (not required for exam answer ) Since the given conditional Conclusion contains two simple statements, an answer must contain a third simple statement to make an HS argument. In the HS pattern, both the antecedent and the consequent of the conclusion are used in the premises. Premise 1 connects with the antecedent (\"Bob's afraid of heights\"); Premise 2 connect s with the consequent (\"Bob will get a different apartment\"). 5) Answer (example) Video games should not be an Olympic sport only if including them in the Olympics will lead to deman ds for a bunch of crazy new Olympic sports (whistling, flying paper airplanes, etc.). Including video games in the Olympics will not lead to demands for a bunch of crazy new Olympic sports . Video games should be an Olympic sport. Explanation (not required for exam answer ) The argument is an objection to the statement \"Video games should not be an Olympic sport\" . For the DC argument pattern, this statement is the antecedent of the conditional premise. The conclusion denies this statement: Video games should be an Olympic sport. This situation is imaginary, but it's reasonable to think the consequent might be necessary for the antecedent. - 76 - PRACTICE EXAM 3 1) Answer The insurance policy cover s floods or it's possible to add coverage for floods. Explanation (not required for exam answer) The given statement is a conjunction (\u00ac P)-AND-(\u00acQ). Its negation is logically equivalent to ( P)- OR-(Q). This answer treats possible as the negation of impossible since the im- prefix means NOT. The double negation not impossible would also be correct : (P)-OR-(\u00ac\u00acQ). 2) Answer Wackadoodle Industries has made a new policy stating that sexual harassment is sufficient for being terminated from the company. Explanation (not required for exam answer ) It would be a very strange company policy that said sexual harassment is necessary for termination. That would mean that nothing else an employee does - not stealing money, not burning the building down - could get them fired. At any normal company, sexual harassment might be enough (sufficient) to get fired but would not be necessary. 3) Answer [Premise 1 ] Gun sales go up whenever people don't trust the government to maintain social order . [Premise 2] People don't trust the government to maintain social order. [Conclusion ] Gun sales are going up . [AA] [Premise 2] Gun sales are not going up. [Conclusion] People trust the government to maintain social order . [DC] - 77 - Explanation (not required for exam answer ) Since the anteced ent \"People don't trust the government to maintain social order\" al ready contains the NOT operator, its negation in the DC Conclusion removes the word not. The argument patterns are: P if \u00acQ. \u00acQ P P if \u00acQ. \u00acP Q P: Gun sales go up . Q: People trust the government to maintain social order . 4) Answer (example s) [Premise 1] Free speech is worth protecting unless people say things that make me angry . [Premise 2] People don't say things that make me angry unless they make jokes about my religion. [Conclusion] Free speech is worth protecting unless people make jokes about my religion. [Premise 1] Free speech is worth protecting unless people say things that make me angry . [Premise 2] I'll go to the protest rally downtown unless free speech is not worth protecting. [Conclusion] I'll go t o the protest rally downtown unless people say things that make me angry . Explanation (not required for exam answer ) Since the given conditional Premise 1 contains two simple statements, an answer must contain a third simple statement to make an HS argument. In the HS pattern, both the antecedent and the consequent of the conclusion are used in the premises. In the first answer, Premise 2 connects with the antecedent of Premise 1 (\" People don't say things that make me angry \"); in the second answer, Premise 2 connect s with the consequent of Premise 1 ( \"Free speech is worth protecting \"). - 78 - 5) Answer (example s) If hamsters were the best pets, they would fetch a stick and bring it back to you . Hamsters won't fetch a stick and bring it back to you . Hamsters are not the best pets. Hamsters are the best pets only if they don't bite little children . Hamsters do bite little children . Hamsters are not the best pets. Explanation (not required for exam answer ) The argument is an objection to the statement \"Hamsters are the best pets\" . For the DC argument pattern, this statement is the antecedent of the conditional premise. The conclusion denies this statement: Hamsters are not the best pets . - 79 - PRACTICE EXAM 4 1) Answer South Australia does not have most of the world's known opal deposits and it's not a popular destination for film shoots . Explanation (not required for exam answer) The given statement is a disjunction (P)-OR-(Q). Its negation is logically equivalent to ( \u00acP)-AND- (\u00acQ). 2) Answer To get consumers to buy electric cars, it will be necessary to build a network of charging stations across the county. Explanation (not required for exam answer ) A network of charging stations might be sufficient if many other things are also true, but the most reasonable thing to say without any other information is that it's necessary. 3) Answer [Premise 1 ] There is not a World Cup this year unless the virus d oes not keep spreading . [Premise 2] The virus will keep spreading . [Conclusion ] There w ill not be a World Cup this year . [AA] [Premise 2] There was a World Cup this year . [Conclusion] The virus did not keep spreading . [DC] Explanation (not required for exam answer ) The conditional uses unless = if not, so the antecedent is the double negation \"The virus does not not keep spreading\" = \"The virus keeps spreading\". The argument patterns are: P if \u00ac\u00acQ. Q P P if \u00ac\u00acQ. \u00acP \u00acQ P: There is a World Cup this year. Q: The virus keeps spreading . - 80 - 4) Answer (example) [Premise 1] Humans will travel to Mars only if national space programs get funded. [Premise 2] National space programs will get funded only if nations are not preoccupied with war and disasters. [Conclusion] Humans will travel to Mars only if nations are not preocc upied with war and disasters. Explanation (not required for exam answer ) Since the given conditional Conclusion contains two simple statements, an answer must contain a third simple statement to make an HS argument. In the HS pattern, both the antecedent and the consequent of the conclusion are used in the premises. The premises connect with the consequent of Premis e 1 and the antecedent of Premise 2 (\"National space programs get funded\"). 5) Answer (example) People will never get bored of superhero movies only if creators can think of more interesting plots. Creators cannot think of more interesting plots . People will get bored of superhero movies . Explanation (not required for exam answer ) The argument is an objection to the statement \" People will never get tired of superhero movies\" . In this statement, never functions as the NOT operator. For the DC argument pattern, this statement is the antecedent of the conditional premise. The conclusion denies this statement: People will get bored of superhero movies. - 81 - ~ 4 ~ -EXPLANATION AND CONFIRMATION - i. -SCIENTIFIC REASONING - Scientific reasoning is not just for scientists doing research . It is for anyone using observations to gain knowledge. Often it begins with an attempt to explain some observ ed fact , to say why or how something happen s. A proposed explanation is one type of hypothesis , a statement that we're not yet ready to fully believe . A new observation may confirm (support) o r disconfirm the hypothesis . Evidence is any observation, past or new, that helps us judge the l ikely truth or falsity of a hypothesis . A Story of Scientific Reasoning Abby has pizza for dinner, and some is left over. She goes out for a while and when she comes back, a piece of pizza is gone. \"Maybe my cat, Mr. Busine ss, ate th at piece of leftover pizza\", she thinks. Then she thinks of another explanation: \"Maybe my roommate , Zelda, ate the pizza.\" (Image: @RealGrumpyCat) Mr. Business has taken human food from the table before, but never anything as big as a whole piece of pizza. Abby knows that Zelda likes pizza. It make s more sense that Zelda ate it. But she wants to test her first idea. \"If my cat a te the pizza then probably he won't want his cat food tonight.\" She prepares Mr. Business' usual cat food and waits to see if he wants it. - 82 - ii. -INFERENCE TO THE BEST EXPLANATION - To explain an event, we think of a hypothesis that would make us expect that event : H explains E (after we observe E) if we could have used H to predict E (before we observe E). Abby observes that the pizza is missing. Her hypothesis (\"the cat ate it\") exp lains the missing pizza because it would lead us to expect the pizza to be gone. Often an explanation is a causal hypothesis , a st ory about what caused the event we 're explain ing. The cat eating the pizza would cause the pizza to be gone. Abby thinks of different possible explanations and choos es the best one. This is inference to the best explanation (IBE). IBE is non -deductive, or inductive , reasoning. Inductive arguments are not supposed to be valid - instead they are evaluated as strong or weak . In a strong argument, the premises support the conclusion well but don't guarantee it. Why is IBE inductive rather than deductive? There are a few reasons: There is no logical method f or determining that one explanation is better than another. Maybe there's a better explanation that we've not thought of . Maybe the best explanation is not true. (The truth may be surprising! ) Competing Explanations In IBE we choose a single \"winning\" explanation from among competing explanations (alternative hypotheses) . Competing explanations are inconsistent : if one is true, the others are false. In the story, Abby c onsiders two competing explanations. Hypothesis 4.1: Her cat , Mr. Business, ate the leftover pizza. Hypothesis 4.2: Her roommate, Zelda, ate the leftover pizza. Common sense tells us that i f her cat ate the pizza then her roommate did not eat it. Of course it 's possible to imagine a weird story in which they both ate the pizza (e.g. they each ate half of it). Many of our examples of c ompeting explanations will be like this, very unlikely though perhaps not impossibl e that they're both true. - 83 - The Best Explanation (That We've Thought Of!) It can be difficult to decide which explanation is best. There are many things we could look for in a good explanation. Here are two important ones . 1) Fit with Background Information An explanation is better when it fits better with background information: it's less surprising , based on what we already know . 2) Simplicity A simple explanation is better than a complicated one. One hypothesis is simpler than another if it's \"easier\" to state, if it explains the observ ation with fewer assumption s or it has fewer parts. As with fit, usually there is no way to precisely measure simplicity. We normally can't say that, for example, one hypothesis is twice as simple (half as complicated) as another. Simplicity is an informal concept. Example (Real) A very strange reptile called Tanystropheus lived 242 million years ago. Fossils show that about half the animal's length was its neck ! Why did it have this bizarrely long neck? (Image: markwitton.com ) Observation 4.3: Tanystropheus had extremely long neck. - 84 - Competing explanat ions say that its neck was an evolutionary adaptation for different hunting styles. Hypothesis 4.4: Tanystropheus ' neck was for reach ing fish while it stood on land . (Image: markwitton.com ) Hypothesis 4.5: Tanystropheus ' neck was for sneak ing up on fish while it hid in water . (Image: Emma Finley -Jacob ) Perhaps Hypothesis 4.4 is somewhat simpler . In 2017, it also fit better with background information. Fossils showed that Tanystropheu s' limbs and ta il were not suitably shaped for swimming . Many paleontologists thought that Hypothesis 4.4 was the b est explanation . But in 2018-20, new fossil studies showed that Tanystropheus had legs that would be good for jumping forward from a n underwater hiding place and a head with breathing holes on top of a flat snout+, similar to crocodile s, which h ide in water to hunt . Hypothesis 4.4 fits much worse with all this new information . By 2020, Hypothesis 4.5 was the best explanation . Renesto, S. and Saller, F. (2018) Evidences for a semi -aquatic lifestyle in the Triassic diapsid reptile Tanystropheus Paleontology and Stratigraphy 124(1), 23-34. + Spiekman, et al. (2020) Aquatic habits and niche partitioning in the extraord inarily long -necked Triassic reptile Tanystropheus . Current 6 on -line. (Image: Emma Finley -Jacob) ( I m a - 85 - Inference to the Best Explanation Main Argument EVIDENCE (observation) HYPOTHESIS is the best explanation of EVIDENCE . HYPOTHESIS is the true explanation of EVIDENCE . Sub-argument HYPOTHESIS fits better with background information than ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHES ES. OR HYPOTHESIS is simpler than ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHES ES. HYPOTHESIS is the best explanation of EVIDENCE . Argument 4.6: [2017] Many animals of the Triassic period (252 -201 million years ago) were reptiles. One of them, Tanystropheus , had a bizarrely long neck that was about half of its body length ! Probably this was an adaptation for reaching f ish while it stood on land. That seems simpler than the other popular explanation , that a land animal moved to the water and evolv ed a long neck to sneak up on fish . It also seems to fit better with what else we know about Tanystropheus from fossils: its body, limbs , and ta il were not well shaped for swimming . The intermediate conclusion is implicit: \"'Tanystropheus ' neck was an adaptation for reaching fish while it stood on land ' is the best explanation of its long neck.\" , in other words, \" is the best explanation of .\" This argument also has a small additional sub-argument, beyond the extended pattern, in which background information supports the \"fit\" claim. Main Argument Sub-argument [Observation] [H is the best explanation .] [H is the true explanation .] As we saw above, this argument was stronger in 2017 than it is now. Based on th e information from the newer fossil studies, and now seem to be false ; is no longer well supported. - 86 - iii. -CONFIRMATION AND DISCONFIRMATION - Confirmation Not every hypothesis is an explanation. In this section, we'll start to consider hypotheses, such as hypotheses about the future, that do not explain anything in particular, as well as others that do. In scientific reasoning, confirmation just means support, not proof. To confirm a hypothesis, we make and check a prediction , a statement that the hypothesis leads us to expect to be true. To be useful, the prediction must be something whose truth we can check sooner or more easily or more directly than the hypothesis. If the prediction is true, this confirms the hypo thesis . A conditional premise connects the hypothesis (antecedent) to the prediction (consequent). Confirmatio n If HYPOTHESIS then EVIDENCE (prediction) . EVIDENCE (prediction true) HYPOTHESIS is true. Argument 4.7: If mindfulness meditation (sitting quietly, focusing on your breathing) works then Abby will feel relaxed after she does it . Later, after meditating , she feels relaxed. So mindfulness meditation works. This argument looks like the deductive fallacy AC! But it's not. Like IBE, c onfirmation is inductive . It's supposed to be strong, not valid. - 87 - Disconfirmation and Background Assumptions Abby does mindfulness meditation but doesn't feel relaxed after wards. This is simple disconfirmation , a regular DC argument : If HYPOTHESIS then EVIDENCE . EVIDENCE is false. HYPOTHESIS is false. We'll construct a more useful version of this argument that recognize s a background assumption , a belief we haven't doubted before now, and which we've used to make the prediction. The easiest way to notice our background assumption s is to think o f ways to complete a more complex conditional sentence : If HYPOTHESIS then EVIDENCE - unless ... Conditional 4.8: If meditation works then Abby will feel relaxed after meditating - unless Abby drank coffee. We saw in Unit 3 that unless means \" if not\". Conditional 4.9: If meditation works then Abby will feel relaxed after meditating - if Abby did not drink coffee. This shows us the background assumption : Abby did not drink coffee. Conditional 4.9 has two antecedents , the hypothesis and the background assumption . It says t hese are together sufficient for the predict ed evidence . The AND operator gives us a way to write this . Conditional 4.9 is logically equivalent to : Conditional 4.10: If meditation works and Abby did not drink coffee then she'll feel relaxed after meditating . Conditional 4.10 says: If HYPOTHESIS AND BACKGROUND ASSUMPTION then EVIDENCE . The prediction is false in our story . So we get a DC argument: If (H-AND-BA) then E. \u00acE \u00ac(H-AND-BA) - 88 - In Unit 3 we learned De Morgan's Laws for the negations of AND and OR . We'll use one of them here. \u00ac(H-AND-BA) = ( \u00acH)-OR-(\u00acBA) This will be a more useful way of writing the conclusion of our disconfirmation argument since it directly reminds us that our background assumption might be false instead of the hypothesis. Disconfirmation (with a Background Assumption ) If H then E unless \u00acBA. / If H-AND-BA then E. \u00acE (\u00acH)-OR-(\u00acBA) Argument 4.11: If mindfulness meditation works and Abby didn't drink coffee then she will feel relaxed after meditating . But later, after meditating , she does n't feel relaxed. So either mindfulness meditation does n't work or she drank coffee. - 89 - -UNIT 4 SKILLS - You must be able to : Think of, or identify in a story, alternative (competing) explanations for an observation.

In the Shanghai Pigeon Association's annual race, pigeons are released far from their home, and the first to return wins a cash prize for its owner. Some pigeons have great speed and endurance, but this year two returned home in an incredibly short ti me - the fastest pigeons ever recorded. The owner claims the breeder bred super -pigeons! It's an outrageous plan but the best explanation appears to be that the pigeons' owner recaptured them after the race began and took them back to Shanghai on the high speed train. The train makes more sense than a car, with which it would be nearly impossible to drive to Shanghai f ast enough in the dense traffic. And t he super -pigeon idea, in which a breeder figured out how to break laws of biology, is way more complicated than the train scheme. It's amazing the things that people will cheat at. - 92 - 2) Answer the questions based on the story. In the 10th century, the Cadronian Kingdom dominated the Eastern Middle region. In the year 978, Princess Yesenia was in line to become the Cadronian queen when her father the king died. All she had to do to become queen was marry Prince Rastupin. But instead she fled the castle, giving up her royal status , and lived the rest of her life as a common person. Historians who study the Cadronian Kingdom have an idea why Yesenia did this: she was influenced by the ideas of a subversive thinker named Flasgar, who led a movement that rejected rul e by royalty and urged royals to give up their status in solidarity with the common people. A few of them did. Now the historians are thrilled by the discovery of a scroll that appears to be a letter Yesenia wrote to her sister in 977, shortly before she f led. They expect that if their idea is right, the letter will tell her sister her plan to join Flasgar's movement. a) What observation do the historians try to explain? b) What is their hypothesis (explanation)? c) Think of an alternative hypothesis. d) What is their prediction? e) Think of a background assumption for this prediction . They open the scroll and read the letter. It says nothing about Flasgar's anti -royalty movement.

The idea of abduction (kidnapping) by aliens has been part of our culture for decades . Most famously, i n 1961 Betty and Barney Hill claimed they had been briefly abducted from their car by a UFO (alien space ship). But think about it: aliens flying across the galaxy just to abduct two humans for an hour is a far more complicated explanation of the Hills' claim than another theory, that the Hills were delusional (hallucinat ing or confused). And although Betty seemed credible at first, delusion makes more sense when you consider that she spent the next twenty years claiming that UFOs were following her , which even other UFO believers thought was crazy . Moreover the fact that no one has ever produced any physical evidence of alien abduction makes it hard to believe their story . The conclusion is inescapable: the Hills were delusional. - 94 - 2) Answer the questions based on the story. Gotham's train system connects downtown to surrounding areas. The Ministry of Transportation is reviewing ridership data and discovers that despite upgrades to the system, ridership has declined. They think that perhaps people are now using the ridesharing service Uber instead of the subway . They want to find out, since an underused train and more street traffic is bad for Gotham. So they get political support to add an extra fee to Uber rides. The new fee begins. They assume that if the train ridership decline was because of Uber, next month's data will show increased ridership. (The ridership data is based on ticket sales records.) a) What observation does the Ministry try to explain? b) What is their hypothesis (explanation) ? c) Think of an alternative hypothesis. d) What is their prediction? e) Think of a background assumption for this prediction .

Oddly, the data s hows no increase in subway ridership. f) Write a disconfirmation argument that includ es the background assumption from ( e). - 95 - PRACTICE EXAM 3 1) Identify the alternative hypothes es (which compete with the best explanation). Write the implicit statement and give it a number. Reconstruct the argument in standard form as an extended IBE argument. TV manufacturers used to make 3D TVs that worked with special glasses. But the manufacturers stopped making these TVs. The reason this happened is debated. Maybe TV stores didn't promote and demonstrate the 3D technology. It's even possible that filmmakers who hate 3D organized a campaign to get manufacturers to drop 3D technology out of respect for traditional film. But the best explanation seems to be that TV buyers just found the 3D glasses too annoying. This is more sensible considering the fact that the stores had a big profit incentive to sell the new products, and the fact that most TV buyers watch TV with their families in living rooms where the 3D glasses make everything in the room look blurry. And obviously the glasses explanation is just more straightforward than a campaign by angry filmmakers! - 96 - 2) Answer the questions based on the story. Scientists at the National Organization for the Study of Planets and Moons (NOSPAM) are studying Mars, looking for liquid water, which is very important for life. They are excited when their telescope shows wavy patterns on Mars. These could be a sign of running water. It's difficult to be sure, but this is high enough that it's worth investigating. (Image: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica) The European Space Agency will send a space probe to Mars in a few years. The NOSPAM scientists have an idea. They calculate the amount of water vapour that would be creat ed in the Mars air by running water. Based on their calculation, they design a new instrument, the Water Vapour Detector (WAVD), to attach to the probe. They think: \"The WAVD will detect water vapour in the Mars air if those wavy patterns were made by runn ing water.\" a) What observation do the NOSPAM scientists try to explain? b) What is their hypothesis (explanation)? c) Think of an alternative hypothesis. d) What is their prediction? e) Think of a background assumption for this prediction . The probe flies to Mars and lands safely. NOSPAM activates the WAVD and it begins measuring gases in the air. The scientists are disappointed when the WAVD sends its report back to Earth: no water vapour in the Mars air. f) Write a disconfirmation argument that includes the background assumption from (e). - 97 - PRACTICE EXAM 4 1) Identify the alternative hypothes es (which compete with the best explanation). Write the implicit statement and give it a number. Reconstruct the argument in standard form as an extended IBE argument. Sparrows are little birds known for the males' bird song. The dominant song across Canada has had a triplet pattern , while a variant song on the West co ast has had a doublet pattern instead. Probably the doublet pattern is more attractive to female sparrows. That's suggested by a surprising recent event : the doublet variant spread across the country , replacing the triplet pattern . One idea, that bird lovers have inadvertently train ed the sparrows to sing the doublet pattern by giving more birdseed to doublet singers, is obviously far too complicated to take seriously. A more reasonable explanatio n, that the doublet version works better for establish ing territories , is not well supported by other observations : birds singing the doublet version don't establish territories more often or quickly . Perhaps in the future there'll be some new sparrow song ! - 98 - 2) Answer the questions based on the story. Abby notices that Bob has not said anything about plans for her upcoming 21st birthday.

This bias is a natural human tendency . We all instinctively look for evidence that supports the beliefs we already have. We might do this when we want our belief to be true ( wishful thinking ), but we do it even with belief s we wish were false. While it's very difficult to suppress confirmation bias, w e can try to counter it by remembering to look for evidence that we 're wrong . Here are four ways confirmation bias can happen . 1) Ignoring Alternative Explanations (of confirming e vidence ) An observation supports a hypothesis when the hypothesis explains it. If there are other explanations , the observation is weaker evidence for the hypothesis , since we can explain the observation without believing the hypothesis . So o ne form of confirmation bias is ignor ing alternative explanations. Confirmation Bias 5.1 : Bob is walk ing around his city's harbour. Past the nice part of the harbour, near an old unused dock, there's a broken boat stuck in the sand. Bob has read stories about sea monster s reported throughout history. He thinks: \"I bet this boat was broken by a sea monster ! A sea monster would probably crash into boats and leave them broken like this .\" When Bob finds evidence (the broken boat) that 's explained by a sea monster, he constructs a confirmation argument that supports th at hypothesis. But there are alternative - and better ! - explanations. The boat is near an old dock where there's little activity. The boat could have been smashed in a storm or by a larger boat, or just rotted without maintenance, etc . By ignoring these explanations, Bob makes the boat seem to be stronger support for the sea monster than it really is. - 108 - 2) Biased Search for Evidence Confirm ation bias can occur in the way that someone looks for, collect s, or remember s evidence. They select evidence that confirms their hypothesis and ignore , or filter out, evidence that disconfirms it. We should judge the hypothesis based on our total evidence, and we should actively search for disconfirming evidence to counter our natural inclination to search for confirm ing evidence. Confirmation Bias 5. 2: \"If there's a sea monster, \" Bob thinks, \"probably it eats a lot of fish and people catch fewer fish here than normal .\" He asks fishing people about their catches. He talks to some in the harbour who tell him they catch a normal amoun t. He asks others returning on a fishing boat and they caught fish just as easily as they do elsewhere. He asks a man fishing north of the harbour who tells him that fishing is a waste of time there - he catches very few fish. \"Aha\", Bob thinks, \"The sea monster has been hungry!\" Bob uses the small fish catch of one person to confirm his sea mon ster hypothesis but ignores other people's normal fish catches. He selects evidence to support the hypothesis he already believes. 3) Ad Hoc Explanation (of disconfirming evidence) If disconfirming evidence is too obvious to ignore, someone with confirmation bias might give an ad hoc explanation instead. This is an excuse someone makes up to \"protect\" their hypothesis from disconfirmation. The y have evidence that should make them think their hypothesis might be false, but they're convinced it's true , so they think of some other way to explain the disconfirming evidence. Confirmation Bias 5. 3: Bob writes letters to the local news demanding that the city government search for the sea monster. The news publish es an article. The city puts an underwater camera in the harbour for a few weeks. When they announce that the camera found no sea monster, Bob thinks: \" Probably t he government doesn't want citizens to panic and flee the city. They're keeping the sea monster a secret.\" - 109 - Bob would accept a n announcement that the city had a photo of a sea monster as confirm ation of his hypothesis, so he should accept the announcement of no photo as disconfirmati on. But he doesn't. He's still sure that there's a sea monster. To protect his hypothesis from disconfirmation, he explains the announcement by saying that the city doesn't want people to panic , though he has no good reason to think that. 4) Imprecise Prediction [This error is not usually called confirmation bias. However the effect of making th e error is that confirmation becomes \"too easy\" and people may overestimate how well a hypothesis is supported, so we'll include it as a form of confi rmation bias.] An imprecise prediction is not specific enough for strong confirmation . The less precise it is, the more possible ways it could be true. But in many of these ways, t he hypothesis will be false. A prediction is supposed to be a test of the hypothesis , but this test is too easy! Passing it shows almost nothing . An imprecise prediction is another way of protecting a hypothesis from disconfirmation. Confirmation Bias 5.4 : \"A sea monster is a big creature that would cause some disturbanc e,\" Bob thinks. He spends the week looking around and talking to people. At a c argo loading dock, workers tell him that a container fu ll of TVs somehow fell into the water last month. \"Wow, that's certainly a disturbance,\" Bob thinks. \"This harbour has a sea monster !\" Bob's prediction is \" some disturbance \" around the harbour . Many different things could count as a disturbance. This prediction is not very precise (specific). So it's not surprising , and not strongly confirming, that the prediction is true. There would likely be a disturbance of some sort even if there's no sea monster. It's too easy for the sea monster hypothesis to pass this test . - 110 - -UNIT 5 SKILLS - You must be able to : Recognize and describe examples of confirmation bias in a story. - 111 - -QUICK TEST QUESTIONS - 1) We'll overestimate the support for our hypothesis by ignoring alternative explanations of what? a) Confirming evidence. b) Disconfirming evidence. c) Our prediction. d) Our test. 2) Which is not an example of a biased search for evidence? a) Ignoring false predictions. b) Looking only for confirmation. c) Remembering only supporting evidence. d) Testing only true hypotheses . 3) What is explained by an ad hoc explanation? a) Confirming evidence. b) Disconfirming evidence. c) A true hypothesis. d) A false hypothesis. 4) An imprecise prediction is bad because it's more likely to be _____ when the hypothesis is _____. a) ...true... true b) ...true... false c) ...false... true d) ...false... false - 112 - -PRACTICE EXAMS - PRACTICE EXAM 1 Identify the hypothesis.

He puts three blocks in her cage: a square, a circle, and a triangle. He says: \"OK, Kalypso, show me how smart you are. Go sit on the square block.\" She wanders over to the triangle and grooms her fur. \" Huh - I bet she's probably extra hungry today and not in the mood for tests.\" He's now convinced and starts posting about Kalypso on Snapagram for his friends to read . - 113 - PRACTICE EXAM 2 Identify the hypothesis.

They're interested in Wackadoodle Industries. Venty thinks that Wackadoodle's bold, outside -the-box thinking on how to streamline product development may shake up the industry and make Wackadoodle the next Amazon or Tesla. One thing Venty looks at in a startup is whether it's building relationships with potential customers who are experts about the industry. That could indicate that Wackadoodle is a good investment. So Venty is excited to l earn that Wackadoodle is in talks with Lambast Technologies, whose chief operations officer is the Wackadoodle founder 's uncle . Lambast gets government contracts and awards many sub -contracts. \"Lambast would recognize a solid company!\" Venty thinks. Venty feels good about Wackadoodle, but still wants a tour of their headquarters. When they arrive, some of Wackadoodle's employees have just put out a fire they accidentally started in the workshop. Many offices are empty and Venty eventually finds everyone cr owded into one office playing a PlayStation 5. Down the hall, two engineers are drawing diagrams on a whiteboard. \"Hey, look at that,\" Venty says. \"These Wackadoodle folks seem to be real pros!\" They arrange to transfer $10 million to Wackadoodle . - 115 - PRACTICE EXAM 4 Identify the hypothesis. Then evaluate the reasoning. Describe two forms of confirmation bias in the story, referring to specific details. Vaping is popular in Gotham and thousands of people have lung illnesses. The main problem is sarsaparilla flavour vape juice, which is dangerous and addictive, so Gotham banned it. Prohibition led to a black market. The Eastside Sarsaparilla Gang sells it illegally on the street. The ESG is afraid the Gotham Police Department is watching them. The y meet at their headquarters and the l eader says: \"Hey everyone, if the GPD is watching us , there will probably be something unusual around here. Let's loo k.\" They walk around the block and notice a parked van that isn't normally there. They start to panic . \"The GPD is going to arrest us!\" The ESG is making deliveries and o ne says: \"There's a helicopter flying around . Let's get a look at it. I bet we'll see GPD markings . Then we'll know for sure we're being watched.\" They go to a bridge to look at the helicopter with binoculars . On the side it says NEWS 1120 Traffic Chopper . \"Wow, the GPD is clever ! They've disguised their helicopter to look like it's for a news station!\" They look at each other and don't need to say anything else. They race back to the headqua rters, grab the cash, and get the hell out of Gotham. - 116 - -ANSWER KEY - QUICK TEST 1) a 2) d 3) b 4) b PRACTICE EXAM 1 Answer Hypothesis : Kalypso understands Bob . Bob shows confirmation bias in supporting his hypothesis . 1) Ignoring alternative explanations of confirming evidence . Kalypso 's hopping seems to be confirming evidence , but she is a Mexican hopping hamster. Maybe she jumps around when Bob asks about the raise because she's naturally hoppy , not because she understan ds him . 2) Ad hoc explanation of disconfirming evidence . When Kalypso fails to show that she understands a simple command, Bob explains his false prediction by thinking that she's extra hungry and not in the mood. But h e had no other reason to think this. It looks like an excuse he gives to protect his hypothesis from disconfirmation . Alternative answers (worth part marks) 1) Imprecise prediction . Although it 's not explicit, B ob seems to have predicted that Kalypso will show excitement when he asks her a question . But this prediction is imprecise. Many different hamster actions (hopping, running, quivering, squeaking) might count as showing excitement, so this prediction had a high chance of be ing true even if Kalypso doesn't understand Bob. 2) Biased search for evid ence. Although Bob doesn't ignore the disconfirming evidence (he explains it), he also doesn't seem to be seriously interested in disconfirming his hypothesis. Once he gets the idea t hat Kalypso understands h im, he is interested only in evidence that supports this. - 117 - PRACTICE EXAM 2 Answer Hypothesis : Prumt is corrupt. Abby shows confirmation bias in supporting her hypothesis . 1) Imprecise prediction : \"Meet people \" is not very precise. Meeting a nyone, anywhere, anytime? There are so many ways this could happen, it's very likely to be true even if Prumt is not corrupt. 2) Biased search for evidence : She seems to ignore or discount the disconfirming evidence that Prumt's house , car, and clothes are not fancy or expensive . Instead she selects and focuses on the confirming evidence of his high-end wristwatch . - 118 - PRACTICE EXAM 3 Answer Hypothesis : Wackadoodle is a good startup company to invest in. Venty shows confirmation bias in supporting their hypothesis . 1) Ignoring an alternative explanation of confirming evidence . Lambast Industries' chief operations officer is the Wackadoodle founder's uncle. Maybe Lambast's interest in Wackadoodle is because of nepotism or family loyalty, not because Wackadoodle is a good company. 2) Biased search for evidence . Venty seems to ignore or discount the signs of incompetence (starting fires) and bad work ethic (playing video games) at Wackadoodle. Instead they select and focus on the confirming evidence of the engineers drawing diagrams. - 119 - PRACTICE EXAM 4 Answer Hypothesis : The GPD is watching the ESG. The ESG shows confirmation bias in supporting their hypothesis . 1) Imprecise prediction . \"Something unusual\" is not very precise. Anything at all unusual? An object ? An event? There are so many ways for something unusual to happen, this is very likely even if the GPD is not watching them. 2) Ad hoc explanation of disconfirming evidence . They predict GPD markings on the helicopter, but when there are none, they explain the false prediction by thinking that the GPD disguised the helicopter. Instead of lowering their confidence in their hypothesis, the y make an excuse to protect it from disconfirmation and then are even more convinced. Alternative Answer s (worth part marks) 1) Ignoring an alternative explanation of confirming evidence . Although there are no specific details in the story that suggest an alternative explanation, the confirming evidence (the parked van) is a very ordinary thing. It is easy to think of many explanations other than the ESG's explanation, e.g. the van belong s to a contractor doing repair work for someone. 2) Biased search for evidence . Although the ESG d oesn't ignore or dismiss the disconfirming evidence (they explain it), they also don't seem to be seriously interested in disconfirming their hypothesis. Once they get the idea that the GPD is onto them , it seems that nothing will reassure them. - 120 - ~ 6 ~ -PROBABILITY - i. -PROBABILITY - The C oncept of P robability A probability is a number from 0 to 1 that is assigned to an event or statement . It expresses the likelihood that the event happens or that the statement is true. 1 100% 0.5 50% 0 0% The extreme s of 1 (100% ) (certainly happens) and 0 (0%) (certainly does not happen) apply in special cases, but not in most real-world situations where it 's possible (a non -zero chance) for some very strange thing s to happen . A probability of 50% says that an event is equally likely to happen and to not happen. Sometimes a probability can be directly calculated based on the details of a situation. For example, we flip a coin. There are two possible outcomes: Heads and Tails. Since Heads is one of two possible outcomes, the probability of Heads - P(Heads ) - is 1/2. Basic Probability Calculation (for equally likely outcomes) P(A) = This calculation works with a fair coin that is equally likely to land Heads and Tails and can do nothing else (e.g. land on its edge, explode in the air, etc.). This gives the same fraction that we'd get if we flipped the coin again and again, counting the to tal flips and the Heads flips: 1/2. That probability would be based on t he frequency of the Heads event , how often Heads happens when flipping a coin. Unit 6 examples use these sorts of probabilities . In Unit 7 we'll also see examples of another sort. A-Outcomes Total Possible Outcomes - 121 - Chance and Odds Chance is often just another word for probability . As we saw above, w e can express the chance of A as a fraction: [A outcomes] -in-[Total outcomes] Odds is a different way to give a probability. Odds is like the score in a sports match : [A outcomes] -to-[B outcomes] or [A outcomes] -to-[Non-A outcomes]. A outcomes + Non -A outcomes = Total outcomes. So we can convert odds into chance. Odds of A Chance of A Probability and Independence A conditional probability P(A|B) is the chance that A happens given (assuming) that B happens. When B happens, d oes that change (raise or lower) the chance of A? Independent Not Independent P(A) = P(A|B) P(A) P(A|B) B does not change the chance of A. B changes the chance of A. Coin flips are independent. Imagine flipping a coin nine times and getting nine Heads . Vocabulary : Sometimes people say \"odds\" when they mean chance (e.g. \"the odds are 1 -in-100\") or \"chance\" when they mean odds (e.g. \"there's a 50 -50 chance\"). ? = - 122 - Does it feel that Heads is less likely ( Tails is more likely) now ? If you're like many people, it does. But the previous nine flips do n't matter. P(Heads |9Heads ) = P(Heads ) = 1/2. The gambler's fallacy is the mistaken belief that an event is less likely when events like it happened recently, or more likely when events like it did not happen recently, though in fact the event is independent of its history. Some events are not independent. Surf: Abby surfs. SharkBite: Abby is bitten by a shark. P(SharkBite |Surf) P(SharkBite). Shark bites are more common among surfers than among people generally (everyone) . If we know that Abby surfs, it's more likely that she's bitten by a shark: P(SharkBite |Surf) > P(SharkBite). Everyone Shark Bite Victims Surfers Shark bites are extremely rare among everyone: P(SharkBite) = extremely low. Everyone Shark Bite Victims - 123 - Shark bites are more common (although still rare) among surfers. The chance of Shark Bite, given that Abby surfs , is low: P(SharkBite |Surf) = low. Surfers Shark Bite Victims Suppose we know that Abby was bitten by a shark. What's the chance that she surfs? This is a completely different conditional probability. Most shark bite victims are surfers! The chance that Abby surfs, given that she was bitten by a shark , is high. P(Surf|SharkBite ) = high. Shark Bite Victims Surfers - 124 - ii. -DISJUNCTION - Disjunction Rule ( Special Case: Mutually Exclusive Events) Twenty UFOs invade Earth: 5 from planet Xenu, 8 from Zargon, and 7 from other planets. Xenu Zargon Other Planet (5) (8) (7) Disjunction uses an addition rule. P(Xen-OR-Zar) = P(Xen) + P(Zar) = 5/20 + 8/20 = 13/20. This simple rule works here because this is a special case where th e events (possibilities) are mutually exclusive : a UFO cannot be from more than one planet. Disjunction Rule Six UFOs are flown by aliens who plan to abduct (kidnap) humans to do weird experiments on them. The chance that a UFO is from Zargon OR it's Abducting cannot be P(Zar) + P(Abd) = 8/20 + 6/20. That addition double counts 3 Abducting Zargon UFOs. Abducting Non-abducting (6) (14) - 125 - To correct this , we subtract the joint probability P(Zar-AND-Abd), the chance of both events happening. P(Zar) + P(Abd) - P(Zar-AND-Abd) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A-AND-B) In the previous example, the special case of the disjunction of the mutually exclusive events, the subtraction doesn't matter since P(Xen-AND-Zar) = 0. Event A either happens or it doesn't happen. One of A and \u00acA must be true. So P(A-OR-(\u00acA)) = 1. The disjunction rule tells us that P(A-OR-(\u00acA)) = P(A) + P(\u00acA) - P(A-AND-(\u00acA)) = 1. Since A and \u00acA are mutually exclusive , P(A-AND-(\u00acA)) = 0. Therefore: P(A) + P(\u00acA) - 0 = 1. Therefore P(A) + P(\u00acA) = 1. Therefore: Negation Rule P(A) = 1 - P(\u00acA) P(\u00acA) = 1 - P(A) - 126 - iii. -CONJUNCTION - Conjunction Rule (Special Case: Independent Events) We just saw that to calculate the chance of a disjunction, we sometimes need to know the chance of a conjunction , a joint probability . We flip two fair coins, A and B. What's the chance that both coins land Heads ? Counting possible outcomes, we see the answer: ) x P(BHeads ) = 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4. This simple rule works here because this is a special case where the events are independent. Conjunction Rule What is P(Zar-AND-Abd)? P(Zar) = 8/20 and 8/20 \u00d7 6/20 = 3/25. This is wrong. As we saw in the previous section, there are : 3-in-20 Abducting Zargon UFOs Xenu Zargon Other Planet Abducting Non-abducting (5) (8) (7) (6) (14) - 127 - The problem is that Zargon and Abducting are not independent. We must multiply with : P(Abd|Zar) to show how Zargon changes the chance of \u00d7 8/20 = 3/20 We can combine the conjunction and disjunction rule s. A UFO lands and aliens come out. What's the chance they plan to abduct us? There are three ways this could be an abducting UFO: Xenu Zargon Other Planet AND OR AND OR AND Abducting Abducting Abduc ting The conjunction rule gives us the chance of each possibility. Since the se are mutually exclusive (a UFO cannot be from more than one planet) , we add the m according to the disjunction rule. The total or overall probability P(Abd) is the sum P(Xen-AND-Abd) + + 3/20 + 2/20 = 6/20 We can see in the picture that this answer is correct : 6-in-20 UFOs are abducting. - 128 - Three Common Confusions 1) Is the | symbol in P(A|B) a mathematical instruction? No! (A |B) means \"A given (assuming) B\". The does not mean \"divided by\", \"plus\", or \"multiplied by\". A and B are events (or statements), not numbers! 2) Are joint probability and conditional probability the same? No! They are completely different. We use a conditional probability to calculate a joint probability. Joint Probability Conditional Probability P(A-AND-B) P(A|B) Chance of two events: A and B Chance of one event: A 3) Are mutual exclusion and non -independence the same? No! Mutual exclusion is a special case of non -independence. Non-independent means that when one event happens, the chance of the other event changes. Mutually exclusive means that when one event happens, the chance of the other event changes to 0. - 129 - iv. -EXPECTED VALUE - Sometimes when deciding what to do, a rational rule is: maximize expected value. We must know the probability and the value (in some units) of each possible outcome of the actions we are considering. An action's expected value is the probability -weighted a verage of the values of its possible outcomes. Like a disjunction of conjunctions, this is a \"sum of products\" calculation. Expected Value (of Action with Possible Outcomes A and B) Expected value = (A-Value \u00d7 P(A)) + (B -Value \u00d7 P(B)) Bob gets a chicken. He wants the most eggs per week. What colour should he paint her coop? He reads about how chickens respond to different colours. In a blue coop, there's a 60% chance his chicken will be happy and lay 5 eggs/week, but a 40% chance she'll be unhappy and lay 1 egg/week. With green , there's an 80% chance of 3 eggs/week and a 20% chance of 2 eggs/week. (Image: Big_Ryan / Getty Images ) Assuming that maximum eggs/week is all that matters, each possible outcome of each action (colour) has a known value (in units of eggs/week). And it has a probability. So Bob can calculate an expected value for each colour and choose the colour t hat maximize s expected value. Blue: (5 eggs/wk \u00d7 0.6) + (1 egg/wk \u00d7 0.4) = 3.4 eggs/wk Green : (3 eggs/wk \u00d7 0.8) + (2 eggs/wk \u00d7 0.2) = 2.8 eggs/wk Bob should paint the coop blue to maximize the expected eggs/wk . This is not realistic! Maybe Bob is happy with 4 eggs/week and a 5th egg has no value to him. Maybe he n eeds at least 2 eggs/week and 1 egg would be a disaster. Maybe the chicken's happiness has value that should be counted (a moral consideration). Maximizing expected value in real life is complicated. - 130 - v. -AT LEAST ONE - Chance of At Least One (Equally Probable Cases) We roll some dice. What's the chance of rolling any 3s (at least one 3)? Since any means \"not none\", the chance of any equals 1 minus the chance of none. With more and more dice, the chance of rolling no 3s gets closer and closer to 0 and the chance of rolling any 3s gets closer and closer to 1. P(At-Least -1 A) (with N equally probable cases) P(AL1-A(N Cases) ) = 1 - P(\u00acA)N = 1 - (1 - P(A))N For P(AL1-Roll3( N Dice)) we put an exponent N on P(\u00acRoll 3) for the number of dice. That tells us to multiply the chance of \u00acRoll 3 by itself for every dice we roll. With one dice, the exponent is 1, and the chance of rolling at least one 3 (AL1Roll 3(1Dice )) is simply the chance of rolling 3: 1/6. P(AL1-Roll3(1Dice) ) = 1 - P(\u00acRoll 3)1 = 1 - (1 - 1/6)1 = 1 - 5/6 0.167 The solution is the same for more than one dice. We just adjust the exponent. For 2 dice: P(AL1-Roll3(2Dice) ) = 1 - P(\u00acRoll 3)2 = 1 - (1 - 1/6)2 = 1 - 25/36 0.306 The solution works the same for any number of cases. For 20 dice, the numbers in the fraction are large, but the structure of the solution is the same. P(AL1-Roll3(20Dice) ) = 1 - (1 - 1/6)20 = 1 - 95,367,431,640,625/3,656,158,440,062,976 0.974 Since the chance of rolling no 3s never reaches 0, the chance of at least one 3 never reach es 1. - 131 - -UNIT 6 SKILLS - You must be able to : Recognize and write probabilities, including conditional probabilities in the chance and odds forms.

Show your calculation. The FRAZ -3 virus is spreading across Azmakia and the country is racing to develop a vaccine that is both safe and effective. Azmakia's labs have been developing several vaccines and now 5 are ready for human trials. Based on past trials, the Health Department knows that a trial vaccine has a 3/4 chance of being safe and a 1/3 chance of being effective. a) What's the chance that the first vaccine is safe or effective? b) What's the chance that any of the vaccines are effective? c) What's the chance that all the vaccines are safe? d) They test 4 vaccines and none are effective. The Health Department says: \"Well, after that, this last vaccine is sure to be effective.\" Evaluate the Health Department's reason ing. 2) Evaluate the reasoning. Azmakia has been battling an epidemic of the new FRAZ-3 virus. The country finally has a vaccine and the government has been making good progress getting the population vaccinated. Most people have been vaccinated. But n ow the government gets some shocking data from the hospitals: 80% of infected people are vaccinated (an infected person is 80% likely to have been vaccinated )! The government is upset - they think that the vaccine doesn't work well. 3) Answer the questions based on the story. Show your calculation. Abby and Bob have kept ratings of their meals at two restaurants: The Lemon and Antique Land. Today they want the best meal. Which restaurant should they choose? At The Lemon, 10% of their meals are 1 star, 20% are 2 stars, and 70% are 3 stars, and none are 4 stars. At Antique Land, 20% of their meals are 1 star, 30% are 2 stars, 10% are 3 stars, 30% are 4 stars, and the other times it's closed without notice (0 st ars). - 135 - PRACTICE EXAM 2 1) Answer the questions based on the story. Show your calculation. Two viruses begin to spread in Azmakia: FRAZ -3 and GLOP -2. The Health Department wants to prioritize a vaccine for the virus they expect to infect more people. Wha t should they do? With any virus, an infected person could be a Superspreader. With FRAZ -3, the chance of being a Superspreader is 5%; with GLOP -2, the chance is 10%. FRAZ -3 Superspreaders infect an average of 25.5 other people, while Normals infect 1.6 o thers. GLOP -2 Superspreaders infect 10.9 others, while Normals infect 2.1 others. 2) Answer the questions based on the story. Show your calculation. Wackadoodle Industries has a great new product design and they're concerned that a member of the development team will betray the company by selling the design to Wackadoodle's competitor. They want to assign the product's development to the team with the lowest chance of betrayal. Which team should the designers choose? Team A is loyal but large: ea ch member has a 0.25% chance of betrayal, but there are 60 members. Team B is small but less loyal: 22 members, each with a 0.75% chance of betrayal. 3) Evaluate the reasoning. There's a large tropical storm in the West Pacific. Probably it'll become a typh oon.

Abby is a public health inspector for the Gotham Health Department. This week she will randomly pick 8 restaurants from the database and do surprise inspections. Normally when the GHD does surprise inspections, they find food safety code violations in 15% of restaurants. a) What's the chance that both of the first 2 restaurants Abby inspe cts have a code violation? b) What's the chance that Abby finds any code violations in her inspections this week? Restaurants in Gotham serve cuisine from several different countries. The most popular food is Azmakian: 26% of Gotham restaurants. Azmakian restaurants are typical for food safety: no more and no less likely to have a code violation. c) What's the chance that the first restaurant Abby inspects is Azmakian or has a code violation? Other kinds of restaurants are not typical for food safe ty. Kazamni restaurants (less popular: only 9% of Gotham restaurants) are worse. Abby knows from her past inspection data that a restaurant with a code violation has a shocking 2/5 chance of being Kazamni. d) What's the chance that the first restaurant Abby inspects is Kazamni and has a code violation? e) Abby visits 7 restaurants and all of them have code violations.

Subtraction of the joint probability corrects for overcounting with addition. Since we have no information that effectiveness and safety are non-independent (nothing says that either event changes the chance of the other), we must treat them as independent and multiply their probabilities for the joint probability. b) Answer P(AL1-Effective(5Vaccines) ) = 1 - P(\u00acEffective )5 = 1 - (1 - P(Effective ))5 = 1 - (1 - 1/3)5 = 1 - 32/243 = 211/243 [Also correct: 0.868] Explanation Any makes this an At Least 1 probability. The chance of any effective equals 1 minus the chance of none effective. \" None effective\" is the conjunction of 5 ineffective vaccines. Since every vaccine has the same chance of being ineffective (they are independent for effectiveness), we can use an exponent for the multiplication. - 138 - c) Answer P(Safe(5Vaccines) (3/4)5 = 243/1,024 [Also Explanation Conjunction rule. Vaccines are independent for safety: every vaccine in a human trial has the same chance of being safe. So we can use an exponent for the multiplication. d) Answer This reasoning is the gambler's fallacy. The vaccines are independent. The chance of effectiveness is 1/3 for every vaccine. It does not go up after several ineffective vaccin es. 2) Answer Basic answer : The government is confused about conditional probabilit ies. Most infected people were vaccinated ( P(Vaccinated |Infected) is high ). This does not mean that most vaccinated people get infected ( P(Infected |Vaccinated) is high). Maybe (hopefully) very few vaccinated people get infected. Extended answer : As more and more people get vaccinated, the percentage of infected people who were vaccinated must rise since there are fewer and fewer unvaccinated people left . What's important (for public health) is that the number of infected people goes down even if the percentage of them who were vaccinated goes up. 3) Answer Expected meal rating = (0 Stars \u00d7 P(0Stars) ) + (1 \u00d7 0) + (1 \u00d7 0.1) + (2 \u00d7 0.2) + (3 \u00d7 0.7) + (4 \u00d7 0) = 2.6 stars Antique Land: (0 \u00d7 0.1) + (1 \u00d7 0.2) + (2 \u00d7 0.3) + (3 \u00d7 0.1) + (4 \u00d7 0.3) = 2.3 stars They should choose The Lemon for lunch.

Since each infected person is a Normal or a Supersprea der, P(Normal) = 1 - P(Superspreader). 2) Answer P(AL1-ABetray) = 1 - (1 - P(ABetray) )60 = 1 - (1 - 0.0025)60 0.139 P(AL1-BBetray) = 1 - (1 - P(BBetray) )22 = 1 - (1 - 0.0075)22 0.153 Wackadoodle should assign the product development to team A. Explanation Wackadoodle's competitor gets their new product design if any team member betrays the company. That's the probability that Wackadoodle must consider. So this is an At Least 1 question. Since they want the lowest chance of betrayal, team A is the better choice. 3) Answer This looks like the gambler's fallacy. If there is no reason to believe that a recent lack of typhoons raises the chance of a typhoon this year, the way this storm develops is independent of the recent weather. The statistics give every storm the same 1 -in-3 chance of becoming a typhoon. 4) Answer + (0.4 \u00d7 0.5) + (0.1 \u00d7 0.2) = 0.28 - 140 - Explanation Conjunction and disjunction rules combined. The solution is the sum of products, a probability weighted average of the probabilities of the possible movie choices. The weights add up to 1, as they must. The answer , the average of the Fall Asleep probabilities, is between the high (40%) and low (10%) probabilities. - 141 - PRACTICE EXAM 3 1) Answer Most things that make the world better (TTMWB) are charities (C). P(C|TTMWB) = high Few charities make the world a better place. P(TTMWB |C) = low 2) a) Answer P(CV(2Restaurants) ) = P(CV)2 = (0.15)2 = 0.0225 Explanation (not required for exam answers) Conjunction rule. Restaurants are independent for code violations : every restaurant has the same chance of a violation . So we multiply 15% \u00d7 15% or use an exponent of 2. b) Answer P(AL1-CV(8Resturants) ) = 1 - (1 - P(CV))8 = 1 - (1 - 0.15)8 0.728 Explanation Any makes this an At Least 1 probability. The chance of any violat ions equals 1 minus the chance of n one. \"None\" is the conjunction of 8 violations. Since every restaurant has the chance of a violation (they are independent for food safety), we can use an exponent for the multiplicat ion. Charit ies TTMWB - 142 - c) Answer P(CV-OR-Az) = P(CV) + P(Az) - P(CV-AND-Az) = 0.15 + 0.26 - (0.15 \u00d7 0.26) = 0.41 - 0.039 = 0.371 Explanation Disjunction rule for independent events. Subtraction of the joint probability corrects for overcounting with addition. Since CV is independent of Azmakian, we multiply their probabilities for the joint probability. d) Answer P(Kaz-AND-CV) = P(Kaz|CV) \u00d7 P(CV) = 2/5 \u00d7 0.15 = 0.06 Explanation Conjunction rule. Kazamni and code violation are not independent - a violation raises the chance that a restaurant is Kazamni . We need the conditional probability of Kazamni given violation . There are two solutions for joint probability. The other solution is P(CV|Kaz) \u00d7 P(Kaz). However, although we have P(Kaz), we don't know P(CV|Kaz) (the chance that a Kazamni restaurant has a violation), P(CV|Kaz), so this solution is not usable. e) Answer This reasoning is the gambler's fallacy. The restaurants are independent. The chance of a violation is 15% for every restaurant . It does not go up after several restaurants with violations . - 143 - ~ 7 ~ -BAYES' RULE - i. -BAYES' R ULE- Two things matter when we judge the probability of a hypothesis based on some new evidence : 1) Prior Probability of the Hypothesis When new evidence E gives H a new probability, what is that new probability? This depends on how likely H was before the new evidence, its prior probability . This is the plausibility (believability) of H, based on background information , or the base rate or prevalence (how often H is true in this kind of situation). P(H) 2) Strength of the Evidence Evidence s trength is the power of the evidence to change the probability of the hypothesis . Evidence strength is the ratio of two probabilities : Chance of Evidence E if Hypothesis H is true P(E|H) Chance of Evidence E if Hypothesis H is false P(E|\u00acH) Evidence strength > 1: E confirm s. E raises the chance of H. Evidence strength < 1: E disconfirm s. E lowers the chance of H. We need a tool to update the probability of a hypothesis from its prior probability based on the strength of some new evidence . This tool is Bayes' rule. Although the rule is mathematical, it teaches some general lessons that are valuable even without a calculation. We've just learned the first two lessons: BAYES LESSON #1: Consider the prior probabilit y. BAYES LESSON #2: Confirming E: more likely if H is true, less likely if H is false. - 144 - Bayes' Rule Bayes' rule for updating the chance of H based on E combines the AND and OR rules we learned in Unit 6. The rule has a short form and an expanded form . The c onjunction rule for Hypothesis -AND- Evidence can be written two ways: To get P(H|E), we divide both sides by P(E). On the left side, P(E) cancels. This is the short form of happens, it happens in one of two situation s: H true or H false . To show the overall chance of E , we can expand the P(E) denominator using the AND (multiplication) and OR (addition) rules. E: (E-AND-H) - P(E|H) and P(H) are copied from the numerator ; and P(\u00acH) equals 1 - P(H), so it's also based on th e numerator. As with the short form of Bayes' rule, w e need three probabilities : P(E|H) and P(E|\u00acH) for the evidence strength , and the prior probability P(H). P(H|E) = - 145 - How to Draw a Bayes Box A Bayes box is a diagram constructed with the numbers used in Bayes' rule. It's a simple way to show an updated probability as an odds ratio . 1 Each side of the box equals 1 (100%) . We'll put 0 on the left , at the bottom. 0 1 Here is an example Bayes box. We'll fill in the box in three steps . STEP 1 What are the prior odds of H? (Divide the box between P(H) and P(\u00acH).) (H) (\u00acH) STEP 2 (\u00acE|H) What's the chance of E if H is true? (E|H) STEP 3 (\u00acE|\u00acH) What's the chan ce of E if H is false? (E|\u00acH) - 146 Example Bayes Box (\u00acE|H) (\u00acE|\u00acH) (E|\u00acH) (H) (\u00acH) How to Look at a Bayes Box The example Bayes box above is drawn to show prior odds of H of 1 -to-3. 1 - to - 3 So the prior probability of H is 1 -in-(1+3) = 1/4. When the box is filled in with the Evidence probabilities P(E|H) and P(E|\u00acH), we get two pairs of rectangles: a shaded pair for E, and an e mpty (unshaded) pair for \u00acE . We'll first compare the E rectangles to updat e H on E ; then we'll compare the \u00acE rectangles to updat e H on \u00acE. - 147 - 1) Hypothesis given Evidence The Bayes box shows the updated odds of H ypothesis given E vidence . We compare the size (area) of the H rectangle to the size of the \u00acH rectangle . Updated o dds of H = - to - After updating H on E, our visual estimate gives approximately 2:3 odds. Bayes' rule converts the se updated odds into a chance: divide the H rectangle by the total (sum). P(H|E) = 2/5 + This is confirming evidence because P(E|H) > P(E|\u00acH). E raises the chance of H from ~1/4 (prior) to ~2/5 (updated). A quickly sketched Bayes box is a simple way to double -check a calculated answer. It should also give you a feel for how Bayes' rule works . Each probability in the rule is one dimension of a rectangle. The H rectangle size compared to the \u00acH rectangle size is the updated odds. 2 3 2 2 3 - 148 - 2) Hypothesis given \u00acEvidence The same Bayes' box also shows the updated odds of H given \u00acE. We compare the two empty (unshaded) rectangles . Updated o dds of H = - to - A visual estimate gives us approximately 1:6 odds. Bayes' rule converts the updated odds into a chance: divide the H rectangle by the total (sum). P(H|\u00acE) = 1/7 + This is disconfirming evidence because P(\u00acE|H) < P(\u00acE|\u00acH). It lowers the chance of H from ~1/4 (prior) to ~1/7 (updated). With these two updates, we see : BAYES LESSON #3: If E confirms H then \u00acE disconfirms H. In Unit 5 we learned about confirmation bias . This bias is a failure to understand Bayes Lesson #3 - in particular, when someone gives an ad hoc explanation of disconfirming evidence. They accept E as confirmation but don't accept \u00acE as disconfirmation. 1 6 1 1 6 - 149 - Evidence Strength It's convenient to have a word as well as a number for evidence strength . Terms like these will be suitable for our examples : Strong Moderate Weak Neutral Weak Moderate Strong 0 1/10 1/5 1/2 1 2 5 10 If P(E|H) (numerator) is 0, the value of the ratio is 0: maximum disconfirmation. P(E|H) P(E|\u00acH) As P(E|\u00acH) (denominator) goes to 0, the value of the ratio goes to infinity: maximum confirmation . We learned (Bayes Lesson #3) that if E confirms then \u00acE disconfirms. However this does not mean that the confirming strength of E must be equal to the disconfirming strength of \u00acE. For example , in the case below, E confirms more strongly than \u00acE disconfirms. Disconfirming strength of \u00acE: 0.4/0.8 = 1/2 0.4 0.8 0.6 0.2 Confirming strength of E: 0.6/0.2 = 3 - 150 - Tests A test asks: Is th is hypothe sis true? A Yes answer is a positive result ; an incorrect Yes is a false positive (\"false alarm \"). A No answer is a negative result ; an incorrect No is a false negative (\"miss\"). Sensitiv ity is the true positive rate, how well the test detect s when the hypothesis is true . Sensitivity = 1 - false negative rate Specificity is the true negative rate, how well the test detect s when the hypothesis is false . Specificity = 1 - false positive rate False Negative Rate Specificity (True Negative Rate) Sensitivity (True Positive Rate) False Positive Rate Base Rate A test that is both sensitive and specific is also accurate - most of its results are true.* A perfect test would have zero errors of eithe r kind , so its results (positive or negative) would always be true. * The accuracy - the percentage of all results that are true - is somewhat depend ent on the base rate, but any test that has high sensitivity and high specificity has at least fairly high accuracy. In contrast, t he positive predictive value (PPV) - the chance that H is true given a positive result (the updated probability of H) - is very dependent on the base rate ( the prior probability of H). A test can have high accuracy and low PPV if, due to a low base rate, most results are true negatives but most positive results are false positives. - 151 - ii. -BAYES IAN UPDAT ING - VISUAL EXAMPLE - This section uses the 20 UFOs from Unit 6 for an example where we can see the answer s in a picture . Xenu Zargon Other Planet Abducting Non-abducting (5) (8) (7) (6) (14) A UFO lands . The a liens tell us \"We're from Xenu.\" Will they abduct us? What is the updated probability P(Abduct |Xenu)? STEP 1 The prior probability the aliens plan to abduct us: 6/20 (Abd) (\u00acAbd) STEP 2 The chance the UFO (\u00acXen |Abd) is from Xenu if they plan to abduct us: 1/6 (Xen|Abd) STEP 3 The chance the UFO is (\u00acXen|\u00acAbd) from Xenu if they do not plan to abduct us: 4/14 (Xen|\u00acAbd) - 152 - The first thing to notice is that the Xenu is disconfirm ing evidence : P(Xen|Abd) < P(Xen|\u00acAbd ). We expect P(Abd|Xen) (updated) < P(Abd) (prior) . Updated o dds of Abduct = - to - A visual estimate gives us updated odds of approximately 1:4. Bayes' rule convert s the updated odds into a chance : divide the Abduct rectangle by the total (sum). P(Abd|Xen) calculated probability matches the visual estima te. Probably we calculated correctly. We can also see the correct answer in the original picture : 1-in-5 Xenu UFOs abduct. The updated probability can help us decide how to act. Suppose we th ink it would be very cool to meet space aliens, but we're afraid of being abducted. We think we should stay and meet the aliens if and only if the chance of abduction is less than 25%. If it's at least 25%, we should run away. Based on the Xen u evidence, the chance is now less than 25%. We should meet the aliens ! P(Abd|Xen) = = 1/5 1 4 1 1 4 - 153 - Suppose instead that t he aliens come out of the UFO and say \"We're not from Xenu.\" This is confirm ing evidence : P(\u00acXen|Abd) > P(\u00acXen|\u00acAbd ). We expect P(Abd|\u00acXen) > P(Abd) . Updated o dds of Abduct = - to - A visual estimate gives us updated odds of approximately 1:2. Bayes' rule converts the updated odds into a chance: divide the Abduct rectangle by the total (sum). matches the visual estimate and the picture: 5 -in-15 (1/3) non-Xenu UFOs abduct. Since t his updated probability of abduction is at least 25% , we should run away! P(Abd|\u00acXen) = = 1/3 1 2 1 1 2 - 154 - iii. -KEEP UPDATING! - A UFO lands and it's from Zargon. We think the aliens may plan to abduct us. We know other information that allows us to test our hypothesis: the space gun test. Do the aliens have space guns? The test is fairly sensitive: 70% of abducting aliens have space guns to zap humans. Only 30% do not (the test's false negative rate). T he test is also quite specific : 90% of non -abducting aliens do not have space guns. Only 10% of non-abducting aliens have space guns (the false positive rate) . These Zargon aliens have space guns! We can updat e the probability of Abduct a second time. The original prior probability of Abduct was 6/20. Updated on the Zargon evidence , the chance of Abduct increased to 3/8. That becomes the new prior probability for updating on the Space Gun evidence. P(Abd|SG) = = (0.7 \u00d7 3/8) (0.7 \u00d7 3/8) + (0.1 \u00d7 5/8) - 155 - iv. -SUBJECTIVE PROBABILITY - This introduction to Bayes' rule uses probabilities that are directly calculated from a simple picture to make them as clear as possible. But many probabilities cannot be assigned in this way. What's the chance ? There is advanced intelligent life elsewhere in our galaxy . Qatar bribed FIFA to be made host of the 2022 World Cup . Canada's next prime minister is a woman given that they belong to the Conservative party . (Image: medium.com) There is no way to calculate probabilit ies such as these . We cannot count equally likely possible outcomes and there don't seem to be any frequencies that directly give us the answers. (For example, there was only one 2022 World Cup.) But we can give a subjective probability that expresses a degree of belief (confidence or feeling of certainty ). Even if they aren't mathematically correct or incorrect, subjective probabilities can still be reasonable or unreasonable. We can explain or justify this kind of probability , but normally we'll be explaining why it is, for example, 60% rather than 80% or 40%, not 60% rather than 61% or 59%. Even though subjective probabilities do not come directly from counting or measuring anything, they are real probabilities! The rules of probability covered in Units 6 -7 apply to them just as they do to other probabilities. The rules tell us what degree of belief we should have in something given the degrees of belief we have in other things. What's the chance? How to assign a probability to H? First think of some common ly used subjective probabilities in different ways , as in the chart below . - 156 - Percentage Fraction Odds 100% 1 1:0 For the smallest benefit, you would bet anything that hypothesis H is true. This probability says that no evidence at all would ever change your mind about the truth of H . 99% 99/100 99:1 For many things, we act as though \"99% sure\" means \"no doubt\", although for very important things (e.g. my plane will not crash) we often want even higher confidence (e.g. 99.9% , 99.999%...). 95% 19/20 19:1 This probability is high enough to be considered significant for some common statistical purposes (see Unit 9). 80% 4/5 4:1 75% 3/4 3:1 66.6% 2/3 2:1 50% 1/2 1:1 If you had to guess whether H is true or false, you would just flip a coin to choose your answer . Here are two ways to discover your degree of belief in H. Fair Bets You can measure your degree of belief by asking yourself what a fair bet would be - neither side of the bet has an advantage , so you wouldn't prefer to take one side of the bet more than the other . For example, maybe you feel that this bet is fair: win $ 1 if H is true ; lose $ 2 if H is false. This means you think the odds of H are 2-to-1 (since $ 1 \u00d7 2 = $2 \u00d7 1). Or maybe it seems fair to win $ 5 if H is true and los e $1 if it's false . Then y ou think the odds of H are 1-to-5 (since $ 5 \u00d7 1 = $1 \u00d7 5). Imaginary Frequencies Imagine that the evidence relevant to H exists in many imaginary \"worlds \", or that many imaginary people have the same evidence that you have. How often in all of these worlds, or for all these people, do you think the hypothesis is true? This frequency tells you your subjective probability. - 157 - -UNIT 7 SKILLS - You must be able to : Write Bayes' rule for a hypothesis and evidence.

Crustie 's auction guarantees the authenticity of items they auction. Their policy is to auction an item only if it has at least 15-to-1 odds of being authentic, as determined by their lab. A seller brings a violin that he claims was made in 1680 by Leonardo V aristradi. In the past, Crustie' s has found that 60% of claimed Varistradi violins are authentic. Another \u00bc are made by apprentices in Varistradi's workshop (less valuable). The rest are forgeries (worthless fakes). With a microscope, the lab can see what kind of wood a violin is made of . Varistradi usually made violins with Mieffe Valley Cyprus . This can be used as a test for authenticity. The MVC test is 75% sensitive.

Ther e's no tornado tonight but the siren sound s. City officials' best explanation is that a electrical malfunction activated the siren. An alternative is that computer hacker criminals sounded the siren to scare people. The system has never malfunctioned, and hackers have hacked other emergency systems. Based on this, the officials think that a malfunction is 60% likely and a hack 30% likely. The city can upgrade the sirens with expensive encryption to prevent hacking. They want to spend the money for that if and only if the odds of a hack are at least 1 -to-2. Hackers would have only a 1/4 chance of break ing the access panel without scratching it.

P(AV|\u00acMVC): What percentage of the total empty region is the empty AV rectangle? There is no reason the updated probabilities should add up to 1! The probability estimates are not for AV and \u00acAV (which always add up to 1), but for AV , given two different pieces of information. 4) Answer The MVC test is negative - the wood is not MVC. We update AV on \u00acMVC. 5) Answer (0.25 \u00d7 0.6) P(AV|\u00acMVC) = 0.314 (0.25 \u00d7 0.6) + ( 0.82 \u00d7 0.4) Explanation Our visual estimate for AV updat ed on a negative result (\u00acMVC) was 1/3 (0.333) , so 0.314 is reasonable . 6) Answer The lab 's analysis disconfirms the AV hypothesis because P(AV|\u00acMVC) < P(AV). (The updated probability is less than the prior.) [Also correct : ...because P(\u00acMVC |AV) < P(\u00acMVC |\u00acAV). (The evidence strength is less than 1.) ] 7) Answer Now Crustie's should not auction the violin because P(AV|\u00acMVC) is less than 15 -to-1 odds (15/16). 8) Answer The chance that the violin is a modern forgery does not have to change now. The maximum probability now is 0.68 6. - 168 - Explanation The question is whether the probab ility must change, not whether it does. Its probability must (logically) change only if there is no long er enough probability available for it to remain the same. The chance of AV went down, so there is more probability (1 - 0.314 = 0.68 6) available for a competing explanation. Of course it 's reaso nable to think the chance of forgery is now higher. 9) Answer (0.75 \u00d7 0.6) P(AV|MVC) = 0. 862 (0.75 \u00d7 0.6) + (0.18 \u00d7 0.4) Explanation We're imagining a positive result with the MVC test. We update AV on MVC. Our visual estimate for AV updat ed on a positive result (MVC) was 7/8 (0.875) , so 0.862 is Answer (0.9 P(AV|Bumpy Label ) 954 (0.9 \u00d7 0.314) + (0.02 \u00d7 0.686) Explanation The story continues with a second piece of evidence (the bumpy label) . The prior probability of AV when they check the label is the updated probability of AV after the \u00acMVC evidence: 0.31 4. 11) Answer Now Crustie's should auction the violin. - 169 - PRACTICE EXAM 2 1) Answer (\u00acOch |\u00acTram) (\u00acOch |Tram) P(Tram |Och): What percentage of the total shaded region is the shaded Trameron rectangle? \u00acOch re: empty rectangles . P(Tram |\u00acOch): What percentage of the total empty region is the empty Tram eron rectangle? There is no reason the updated probabilities should add up to 1! The probability estimates are not for Tram and \u00acTram (which always add up to 1), but for Tram , given two different pieces of information. Ochre , so w e update Tram on Och. 4) Answer (0.2 \u00d7 0.7) P(Tram |Och) = 0. 459 (0.2 \u00d7 0.7) + (0.55 \u00d7 0.3) Explanation Our visual estimate for Tram updat ed on Och was 5/11 (0.454), so 0. 459 is reasonable . - 170 - 5) Answer The lab's analysis disconfirms the Trameron hypothesis because P(Tram |Och) < P(Tram). (The updated probability is less than the prior.) [Also correct : ...because P(Och|Tram) < P(Och|\u00acTram ). (The evidence strength is less than 1.) ] 6) Answer Now the archaeologists should not use their budget to search the coast beca use the updated probability of the Trameron hypothesis is less than 3 -to-2 odds (3/5). 7) Answer (0.8 \u00d7 0.7) P(Tram |\u00acOch) = 0.806 (0.8 \u00d7 0.7) + (0.45 \u00d7 0.3) Explanation Our visual estimate for Tram updat ed on \u00acOch was 4/5 (0.8), so 0.806 is reasonable. 8) Answer False negative rate: 3/8 Specificity: 95% Sensitivity: 5/8 False positive rate: 5% Explanation The story describes two kinds of false negatives (Trameron paintings with no hand outline). We add these rates together for the total false negative rate. Sensitivity = 1 - false negative rate = 5/8. The question gives us the test specificity. False positive rate = 1 - specificity = 5%. 9) Answer (5/8 \u00d7 0.459) P(Tram |HO) (5/8 \u00d7 0.459) + (0.05 \u00d7 0.541) Explanation The story continues with a second piece of evidence (the hand outline). The prior probability of Tram when they check for the hand outline is the updated probability of Tram after the Och evidence: 0.459. 10) Answer Now the archaeologists should use their budget to search the coast. - 171 - 11) Answer The chance of the Gthylio hypothesis does have to change now. Its maximum probability now is 0.086. Explanation Its probability must change if there is no long er enough probability available after an update for it to remain the same. By the end of the story, the Trameron hypothesis is more likely than it was at the beginning, and the Gthylio hypothesis can no longer be as likely as it was. The maximum probability (1 - 0.914 = 0.086) is the logical maximum, i. e. if there were no other alternative hypotheses. Of course there still would be, so its actual probability would be less than 8.6%. - 172 - PRACTICE EXAM 3 1) Answer (\u00acSAP|Hack) (\u00acSAP|\u00acHack) (SAP|Hack) (SAP|\u00acHack) (Hack) (\u00acHack) 2) = 1/2 P(Hack SAP: shaded rectangles. P(Hack |SAP): What percentage of the total shaded region is the shaded Hack rectangle? \u00acSAP: empty rectangles. P(Hack |\u00acSAP): What percentage of the total empty region is the empty Hack rectangle? There is no reason the updated probabilities should add up to 1! The proba bility estimates are not for Hack and \u00ac Hack (which always add up to 1), but for Hack, given two different pieces of information. 3) Answer (P(SAP|Hack) Explanation The access panel is scratched, so we update Hack on SAP. 4) Answer (3/4 \u00d7 0.3) P(Hack|SAP) = 0.4 79 (3/4 \u00d7 0.3) + (0.35 \u00d7 0.7) - 173 - Explanation The \u00bc chance that hackers would avoid scratching the panel means there's a \u00be chance they would scratch it. Our visual estimate for Hack updated on SAP was 1/2 (0.5), so 0.479 is reasonable. 5) Answer The scratched access panel confirm s the Hack hypothesis because P(Hack|SAP) > P(Hack). (The updated probability is greater than the prior.) [Also correct : ...because P(SAP|Hack) > P(SAP|\u00acHack ). (The evidence strength is greater than 1.)] 6) Answer The city should upgrade the siren system with encryption because the updated probability of the Hack hypothesis is greater than 1 -to-2 odds (1/3). 7) Answer (1/4 \u00d7 0.3) P(Hack|\u00acSAP) = 0.142 (1/4 \u00d7 0.3) + (0.65 \u00d7 0.7) Explanation Our visual estimate for Hack updated on \u00acSAP was 1/8 (0.125), so 0.142 is reasonable. 8) Answer False negative rate: 40% Specificity: 2/3 Sensitivity: 60% \u00d7 0.479) + (1/3 \u00d7 0.521) Explanation The story continues with a second piece of evidence (the forum post). The prior probability of Hack when they check the forums is the updated probability of Hack after the SAP evidence: 0.479. 10) Answer The chance of the Malfunction hypothesis does change now. Its maximum probability now is about 38% (1 - 0.62). - 174 - ~ 8 ~ -ANALOGI ES- i. -ARGUING FROM ANALOGY - Analogies and Analogical Arguments An analogy says that one thing is similar to another . Analogy 8.1: The Amazon River is like the Nile River. In an extended analogical argument , an analogy is the intermediate conclusion. The sub -argument supports the analogy by noting common (shared) features of the items in the analogy . Analogical Argument Pattern Main Argument Analogy: A is similar to B. B has [Feature]. A has [Feature]. Sub-argument A and B both have [Common Feature 1]. Etc. Analogy: A is similar to B. The argument pattern is inductive. Similar does not mean \"the same \"! Even if A and B are generally alike, A might not have th e feature in the conclusion . - 175 - Here's an example using the rivers analogy. The main argument feature is \"has several tributary rivers that flow into it.\" The Amazon River is compared to three other rivers ; the analogy is supported by premises noting three common features. Argument 8. 2: The Amazon, Nile, Yangtze, and Mississippi are huge rivers flowing for thousands of kilometres, they periodically flood, and they empty into the sea. And since the Nile, Yangtze, and Mississippi rivers have several tributary rivers that flow into them, probably the Amazon River has several tributary rivers that flow into it, too. (Image: worldmapblank.com) The analogy is implicit : \"The Amazon River is similar to the Nile, Yangtz e, and Mississippi rivers.\" The reconstruction below shows the role of each statement in the argument pattern. Main Argument Sub-argument [B, C, D have Feature. ] [Analogy : A is similar to B, C, D] [A has Feature. ] - 176 - ii. -WEAK ANALOGIES - Like any argument, an analogical argument needs true premises to be a good argument . To criticize an analogical argument, someone could disagree with any premise. But very o ften criticism of an analogical argument criticizes the analogy. Even though an analogy is a statement, a nalogies are usually said to be strong or weak rather than true or false. An analogy is weak if the compared items are significantly different. When is a difference significant? There 's no rule for how to judge this significance . All we can do is consider what we know about the topic and judge if we think the analogy may be misleading. The Amazon River has flesh -eating piranha fish but the other rivers don't. Is th is difference significant ? Can we think of any \"connection\" between piranhas and tributaries that would make the conclusion less likely ? Maybe not. Maybe th e piranha difference isn't very significant , and the analogy , and argument, are still fairly strong. (Image: Nihongonihongo) - 177 - iii. -ANALOGI CAL NORMATIVE ARGUMENTS - An analog y is a common way to support a normative statement , a claim that something should (or should not) be done , or that it's good (or bad) or morally right (or wrong). A general rule for normative arguments is that a normative conclusion requires a normative premise. An analogical argument with a normative main argument feature follows this rule. Argument 8.3: It should be illegal for tanning salons to sell their services to minors (people under 18 ). Just like smoking, tanning has proven health risks - it causes cancer (skin cancer). Moreover like smoking, tanning appeals to young people who take their health for granted . There is even evidence that people become addicted to tanning, as they do to smoking . So in fact, selling tanning services to minors is really a lot like selling cigarettes to minors. The analogy is explicit ( ) but a premise is implicit : \"It should be illegal to s ell cigarettes to minors .\" Main Argument Sub-argument Does Argument 8. 3 convince you that statement is true? You might criticize the argument by disagreeing with any premise. Maybe you reject because you think selling cigarettes to children should be legal ! A more reasonable criticism might be : is a weak analogy . There are significant differences between smoking and tanning . For example, there's no way to smoke without cigarettes , but it's easy to tan without a tanning salon by just lying in sunlight . - 178 - -UNIT 8 SKILLS - You must be able to : Reconstruct an extended analogical argument.

Artificial intelligence is rapidly improving at the task of facial recognition, matching an image of a face (e.g. from a security camera) to a face in a database. Now privacy supporters around the world want laws banning corporations and police from using facial recognition technology. But these people are misguided: there 's nothing wrong with police use of facial recognition systems. Privacy supporters who fear that we'll all soon be living in a \"surveillance society\" where everyone's movements are tracked and recorded are just being paranoid. Consider this: a \"super -recognizer \" is someone with highly developed structures in the temporal lobe of their brain th at allow them to reliably identify far more faces than normal people can, and police departments in the UK employ super -recognizers to identify people in security camera images . Surely there 's nothing wrong with police using super -recognizers. But facial recognition technology, much like the temporal lobe of a super -recognizer, is just a system th at's highly effective for a function that normal people already do less well , although both sy stems make mistakes . While it's true that c itizens don 't know about or consent to having their images viewed by facial recognition technology , the same is true of super -recognizers . - 181 - PRACTICE EXAM 2 Write the implicit statement and give it a number.

This criticism may be your own personal opinion or something you think a reasonable person might say. Of the 6000 -7000 distinct languages in the world today , about half are spoken only by small communities, and several hundred are close to extinction , meaning that without active preservation, they will soon disappear as their last speakers die. If you don't see why you should care about this, here's a new way to look at it: w hile it's not often noticed , the extinction of a language is actually a lot like the extinction of a bi ological species . In both cases , the world loses a wonderful kind of diversity that was created by a long evolutionary process . And as everyone acknowledges, it's important to prevent the extinction of biological species. And there's more. The scien tific value of languages, based on all the things scientists can learn about the evolutionary and other processes that created them, is similar to the scientific value of biological species, although of course scientists are also the first to acknowledge in both cases that having the real thing existing in the world is much more wonderful than just having knowledge about its past existence.

Reconstruct the argument in standard form using statement numbers. Evaluate the argument by discussing both of the main argument's premises. Suggest a reasonable criticism of at least one of them. This criticism may be your own personal opinion or something you think a reasonable person might say. Allowing people to sell their personal data is a terrible idea , although that is currently a goal of several companies and politicians. They think that people should legally own - and be able to sell - all the personal data that gets created about them in the me dical system, social media , and online shopping . Some of this da ta is already being collected and sold in a huge data marketplace of which few people are fully aware. It might seem like a positive and empowering change until you reflect on the fact that it would be a terrible idea to allow people to sell their organs (e.g. kidneys) for transplant operation s. Notice that your data and your organs are both created by y ou just in the course of living your life. And crucially, in both cases poor people would feel pressure to sell them if th ey had the option of doing so - a marketplace would lead to the exploitation of people who are already disadvantaged. I suspect that some of the se politicians are well -meaning but just haven't thought th eir plan through. The argument in this exam is based on Jeong, Sarah. (2019 July 5).

Reconstruct the argument in standard form using statement numbers. Evaluate the argument by discussing both of the main argument's premises. Suggest a reasonable criticism of at least one of them. This criticism may be your own personal opinion or something you think a reasonable person might say. Heroin addicts are at risk of deadly infectious diseases and overdos es. Society also spends a lot of money putting the se people in jail, either for possessing an illegal drug or for stealing things to be able to buy it. Many of these problems could be addressed if we learned to see heroin addiction in a different way. Of course we'd like to cure every heroin addict, but it should be legal for doctors to supply the opioid drug h eroin to people with incurable addiction . Here's the idea : heroin addiction is really not much different from diabetes (a disease that makes people unable to absorb sugar unless they take the drug in sulin). Just like d iabetes , heroin addiction can be a long-term, life -threatening , incurable condition . Moreover like heroin addicts who originally chose to use heroin, many adult diabetics get the disease partly from lifestyle choices ( e.g. poor diet ). But however they got their disease, the fact is that addicts and diabetics can each live fairly normal lives with simple , cheap injections. Maybe this perspective on heroin, shocking though it is to many people, will be enough for society to approach the problem in a more humane and effective way. - 184 - -ANSWER KEY - QUICK TEST 1) c 2) b 3) b PRACTICE EXAM 1 Answer Implicit statement : Facial recognition systems are similar to super -recognizers. ( Also correct : Police use of facial recognition systems is similar to police use of super -recognizers.) Main argument Sub-argument [B has Feature. ] [A is similar to B.] [A has Feature. ] Evaluation [Example Answer] : This analogical argument is fairly strong . I think is true. Super -recognizers are just people who use their talent to prevent crime. It would make no sense to insist that police departments hire only bad recognizers. I think the analogy in is strong enough to provide good support for the conclusion. However I can see why some people might think there are impor tant differences between facial recognition systems and super -recognizers that are not acknowledged in this argument. For example : Super -recognizers are people who could decide whether to help police or corporations based on whether doing that seems ethic al, but computers can't make those ethical decisions. Being recognized by a person is a normal and natural thing but being recognized by a computer is weird and creepy.

Main argument Sub-argument [A is similar to B.] [B has Feature. ] has Feature. ] Evaluation [Example Answ er]: This analogical argument is very weak. I disagree with . While there may be some species that it's important to save because they're useful to us, in general it doesn't really matter whether a species continues or not. In fact in many cases (e.g. mosquitos) it would probably be better if they did go extinct. I also think that is a weak analogy. There are important differences between languages and biological s pecies that are not acknowledged in this argument. For example: Languages can isolate people from each other culturally, socially, and economically, but biological species don't isolate people from each other . A biological species is group of living creatures trying to survive , but the words and grammar of a language aren't living things and don't try to survive. They are just a way in which people choose to communicate with each other . While the disappearance of a biological species c ould have unpredictable effects on ecosystems, it doesn't seem that there are similar risks with the disappearance of a language. Explanation (not required for exam answers) The function of each statement in the main argument is given in [brackets]. This is not a required part of the answer. The evaluation is an example answer.

Main argument Sub-argument [B has Feature. ] [A is similar to B.] has Feature. ] Evaluation [Example Answ er]: This analogical argument is weak. The analogy in is surprising but actually pretty strong. It isn't perfect. For example: Data is information and organs are parts of your body . You can make more data but you can't regrow organs. But I don't think th ese difference s are big enough or important enough to affect this argument. However seems totally wrong to me . I think people should be free to do what they want with their bodies so long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. Not only does selling an organ for transplant not hurt anyone else, but it could even save someone's life.

Main argument Sub-argumen t [A is similar to B.] [B has Feature. ] [A has Feature. ] Evaluation [Example Answer]: This analogical argument is somewhat weak . There can be no serious doubt about . It's obviously true the diabetics should get insulin . The analogy in is fairly well supported in the argument but there are some important differences between heroin and insulin that are not acknowledged. For example : Without insulin, a diabetic will die; without heroin, addicts will suffer terrible withdrawal symptoms, but they won't actually die. The two chemicals treat the two diseases in very different ways. Insulin is naturally made by the body and a diabetic's insulin shots simply replace it. But heroin is completely different from the body's own opioids (such as endorphins). It's not naturally made by the body; it just happens to attach to the same receptors in the brain.

Sampling is a work -saving procedure. We learn about the population by measuring the sample and then generalizing from it to the whole population . Generalizing from a Sample Argument Pattern N% of [Sample has [Feature]. N% Gotham General Hospita l, 30% of pregnancies with women aged 20 -24 are unplanned , so 30% of pregnancies in women aged 20 -24 in Gotham are unplanned . In Ar gument 9.1, the popul ation is pregnancies in women aged 20 -24 in Gotham , the sample is pregnancies in women aged 20 -24 at GGH, and the feature is unplanned . If the feature is less or more common in the sample than it is in the population , a generalization based on that sample will be an undere stimate or overestimate . Generalization will be : Generalization will be: Under estimate Over estimate Population Has featureSample Sample - 189 - ii. -SAMPLE SIZE - Measuring a larger sample gives us a better ability to generaliz e. Sample size is indicated with n=. Argument 9.2: At GGH, 30% of pregnancies with women aged 20 -24 (n=500) a re unplanned , so 30% of preg nancies in women aged 20 -24 in Gotham are unplann ed. Precision and Accuracy People often use the words precision and accuracy as though they mean the same thing . In fact they are completely different concepts . The precision of a statement is its exactness or specificity. The accura cy of a statement is how close it is to the truth. Statement 9.3: The speed of light is 155,286,903 m/s. Statement 9.4: The speed of light is 271,306,682 m/s. Statement 9.5: The speed of light is around 300,000,000 m/s. Statements 9.3 and 9.4 are equally precise. Statement 9.5 is less precise because of around . The true speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s. That means that each s tatement is more accurate - closer to the truth - than the previous one. The concepts of precision and accuracy also apply with non-quantitative examples. Statement 9.6: Stanley Park is in Canada. Statement 9.7: Stanley Park is in BC, Canada. Statement 9.8: Stanley Park is in Victoria, BC, Canada. Each statement is more precise than the previous. The most precise, Statement 9.8, is inaccurate. - 190 - Archery is a helpful analogy . Generalizing is like shooting an arrow at a target . Precision is the target size. Higher precision = smaller target . It's more difficult to hit (be accurate with) a small target . -pts % +pts Margin of Error and Confidence Level A complete statistical generalization includes a margin of e rror (MoE), which quantifies the precision . The statistic ( N%) is the target's centre and the MoE is the distance to either edge. The MoE is given in the units of percentage, percentage points (pts). Larger MoE = bigger target = lower precision. Argument 9.9: At GGH, 30% of pregnancies with women aged 20 -24 (n=500) a re unplanned , so 30% of pregnancies in women aged 20 -24 in Gotham are unplanned (\u00b14 pts). 26% 34% MoE is calculated f or the sample size at a chosen confidence level , the chance that the correct percentage for the population is within this range . This is the strength of the argument (assuming an unbiased sample - see Sec.iv) . A 95% confidence level is common - if it's not stated, as in Argument 9.9, we can assume 95%.+ MoE also depends on population size. In most of the examples in t his unit, population size is the same: huge. This makes it simpler to see the effect of different sample sizes. MoE also depends on the percentage measured in the sample. Often MoE is simply given for a sample size, in which case MoE is calculated assuming a measurement of 50%. This is the maximum MoE. For a measured percentage lower or higher than 50%, the MoE is smaller. + Although 95% is convenient for mathematical reasons , it is a choice. We could choose any confidence level. (And there are other mathe matically convenient but less memorable numbers, such as 68% and 99.7%.) A confidence level of 95% is standard because it's easy to remember and picture (a 19 -in-20 chance), high enough to take the statistic seriously, but not so high that the margin of er ror becomes huge. - 191 - With a small sample , the archer has b ad aim (the y're shaky ), so it's hard to be accurate . To have high confidence , they must shoot at a large target ( low precision /large MoE). If the target is smaller ( higher precision /smaller MoE) but their aim is the same (same sample size) , they have lower confidence. To have high confiden ce with a small target (high precision ), they need better aim ( larger sample ). - 192 - The usefulness of a sample is determined by its size. Compare Argument 9.9 to 9.10: Argument 9.10: At GGH, 30% of pregnancies in women aged 20 -24 (n=500) a re unplanned , so 30% of preg nancies in women aged 20 in Gotham are unplanned (\u00b15.3 pts; 99% Confidence ). The sample size (n=500) is the same, so it's equally useful. But it's been used differently . Argument 9.10 has a higher confidence level (99% vs. 95% in Argument 9.9 ) - it's stronger. How is that possible , if the higher confidence has not been earned by doing more sampling work? H igher confidence doesn't come for free! Here i t's been achieved simp ly by lowering precision (\u00b15.3 pts vs. \u00b14 pts). - 193 - iii. -COMPARING STATISTICS - Margin of error can be important when we compar e statistic s to find a differen ce. Argument 9.11: It seems that clothes bought at night from our website FashionPassion.com are more likely to be returned. Last month's records (n=250) show that the return rate for nighttime purchases is 84% (\u00b14.5 pts). But the records (n=350) show that the return rate for daytime purchases is only 32% (\u00b14.1 pts). Argument 9.11 has two sub-arguments . Their conclusions support a final conclusion that asserts a difference (\"more likely\") . Both statistic s have MoE, shown with error bar s in the chart . Since t here's a large gap between error bar s, this is strong evidence that there really is a difference between nighttime and daytime purchases . Imagine instead that the measurements had been 62% and 55%. These statistic s are separated by only 7 pts. Now the error bars overlap. This suggest s there's a difference , but we can't be very sure. To be more sure of this small difference, we need small er MoE; to get smaller MoE (at the same confidence level) , we need large r samples . 50%55%60%65% Nighttime DaytimePurchases from FashionPassion.com Returned 0%20%40%60%80%100% Nighttime DaytimePurchases from FashionPassion.com Returned - 194 - iv. -SAMPLE SELECTION - Sample Bias In a biased sample , the measured feature is more (or less ) common than it is in the whole population - but not just by bad luck (sampling error) . Rather, it's because the items in the sample have some feature that makes them more (or less ) likely to have the measured feature . To understand the sample bias, we must know about this relationship between the measured feature and a sample feature . If we know this background information, we know to expect an overestimate (or under estimate ). Here's an analogy . We're pouring hot water and cold water into a large bucket. To find the temperature of the large bucket water (population), we measure the temperature of the hot water (sample). Hot Cold Regardless of the amounts of hot and cold water we combine, the large bucket water temperature must be between the hot and cold temperatures , which means that it's lower than the hot water we sampled . So measuring the hot water to find the large bucket temperature gives an overestimate. Abby has been travelling around the world by airplane, visiting many cities. She thinks: Argument 9.12 : 60% of the cities I've visited have a university (and I've visited a lot of cities !). So about 60% of cities have a university. Can you see the problem here? Hot Cold Total WaterTotal Water (Large Bucket) Temp Overestimate - 195 - This is a biased sample. Background info: Universities (measured feature ) are more common among cities (population items ) with an airport ( sample feature ). Probably the statistic is an overestimat e. Convenience Samples vs. Random Samples Sample bias is a risk when using a convenience sample , a sample composed of population items that are available and easy to include. Convenience samples are not necessarily biased and are common in many kinds of research. But we must be aware of the risk of bias and watch out for it. Ideally we want to use a random sample (e.g. selected by lottery) for which every item in the population has the same chance of being selected . This sample could be randomly different from the population , just by bad luck - there's still the problem of sampling error! But we have no reason to expect specifically an overestimate (or underestimate ).

Briefly explain your answer. a. We tested water quality in buildings around the city (n=150), and 31% of them had water that is too dirty to be safe to drink. So 31% of buildings in the city have dirty water (\u00b17.4 pts). b. We tested water quality in buildings around the city (n=300), and 31% of them had water that is too dirty to be safe to drink. So 31% of buildings in the city have dirty water (\u00b15.2 pts). c. (a) and ( b) are equally strong. 2) Answer the question based on the story. Explain your answer. Bob and Abby work at sidewalk food carts downtown. Today Bob got the best (busiest) location, where he will get more customers than Abby . Mostly they sell hot dogs, but about 10% of their customers buy their deep-fried squid -on-a-stick. Today who is more likely to have at least \u00bc of their customers order squid -on-a-stick: Abby, Bob, or are they equally likely? 3) Identify the elements of the argument and then evaluate it. We learned that only 22% of houses in Gotham have smoke detectors with properly charged batteri es (\u00b13.5 pts ). We checked houses (n=550) in Burnside, the poorest neighbourhood in Gotham and o nly 119 of them had smoke detectors with properly charged batteries. a) State the population, sample feature, measured feature, sample size, margin of error, and confidence level. b) Evaluate the argument. Illustrate your evaluation with a bar chart. - 199 - PRACTICE EXAM 2 1) Which argument is stronger ? Briefly explain your answer. a.

We asked Hollywood producers (n=250) if they considered themselves bigshots, and 75% did, so 75% of Hollywood producers consider themselves bigshots ( \u00b13.5 pts; 80% Confidence). c. (a) and (b) are equally strong. 2) Reconstruct and evaluate the argument. Gotham's popular Deathtrap nightclub is not only the coolest club in town but also has the highest success rate for getting patrons to buy the overpriced, watered -down drinks - greater success than Gotham's next most successful cl ub, Candyland. 74% of Deathtrap patrons buy the overpriced, watered -down drinks, based on the patrons we surveyed (n=54) recently at Deathtrap . 74% of our sample bought the drin ks. But when we surveyed patrons (n=48) at Candyland , only 71% had bought the drinks, so Candyland's rate is only 71%. 3) Evaluate the reasoning of the news stories in the following (true) story. Researchers at Boston University were interested in the link between (American) football and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease that causes cognitive and mood problems. It's believed to be caused by mild repetitive brain trauma of the sort that football players normally experience even while wearing helmets. The researchers studied 202 football player brains that were donated to the CTE study by their families when they died. They found CTE in nearly every brain. Many news headlines reported the findings by announcing that almost all football players get CTE. - 200 - PRACTICE EXAM 3 1) Which argument is stronger? Briefly explain your answer. a. At our gadget factory, we tested gadgets coming off the assembly line to see if they work as designed. In our sample (n=400), 88% work as designed. Therefore 88% of our assembled gadgets work as designed (\u00b13.2 pts). b. At our gadget factory, we tested gadgets coming off the assembly line to see if they work as designed. In our sample (n=400), 88% work as designed. Therefore 88% of our assembled gadgets work as designed (\u00b14.2 pts). c. (a) and (b) are equally strong. 2) Evaluate the reasoning in the story. Azmakia is having a referendum next week to decide whether to officially make the dung beetle the national arthropod of Azmakia. Azmakian law requires 3-to-2 support for a referendum proposal to pass. The dung beetle supporters have been campaigning for mo nths and are now sure they have enough support for success in the referendum. They asked 115 people from all around Azmakia who plan to vote and 6 3% of them support the proposal. 3) Identify the elements of the argument and then evaluate it. At the Wackadoodle gadget factory, the Quality Control Department needs to determine the defective rate for the gadgets they produce. There are several employees in the factory making gadgets , so QC picks one employee whose gadgets they will monitor. They choose Bob, a new employee. It's his first week on the job. They check Bob's gadgets (n=320) and discover that 16% are defective. \" Wackadoodle has a major quality control problem!\", they conclude. \"16% of our gadgets are defective!

The larger sample in argument (b) is used to increase precision (smaller MoE) rather than increase confidence. 2) Answer Abby. Her less busy location gives her a smaller sample of customers that is more likely to have a different composition (at least \u00bc who want squid -on-a-stick) than the population of all customers (10% who want squid -on-a-stick). 3) Answer a) Population : Gotham smoke detectors [Also correct: Gotham houses] Measured feature : has charged batteries [Also correct: has smoke detector with charged batteries] Sample feature : in Burnside Sample size : 550 MoE: \u00b13.5 pts Confidence level : 95% (assumed) b) Evaluation : This argument is bad because it uses a biased sample. Burnside is a poor neighbourhood where people have bigger problems to worry about than replacing smoke detector batteries , and do little house maintenance . We can expect that c harged batteries are less common in Burnside Gotham smoke detectors . [Also correct : Burnside Gotham smoke detectors are less likely to have charged batteries. ] Probably 22% is an underestimate. The study should have checked randomly selected houses from all over Gotham . - 202 - Explanation The population is a group of items, the subject of the conclusion. The measured and sample features are not things - they are properties that population items may have or not have. The margin of error is given in pts, not %.

Argument ( b) uses the sample to increase precision (smaller MoE); argument (a) uses it to increase confidence. 2) Answer Main Argument Sub-argument Sub-argument Evaluation : This is a weak argument. The conclusion is based on a comparison of two statistical generalizations - the drink -buying rates - that are based on fairly small samples of patrons at the clubs. Using standard confidence levels, these statistics wo uld have margins of error that are large compared to the difference between them (3 pts). In other words, the margins of error would overlap. Patrons at Deathtrap nightclub might be equally or even less likely to buy the drinks than those at Candyland. Explanation The two sub -arguments each use the pattern (generalizing from a sample) introduced in this unit. The main argument simply compares two statistics (its premises) and concludes that there is a difference. This is the written version of the two -bar bar chart. In the chart, if margins of error were known, they would be indicated with error bars. 3) Answer The news stories treat the brains in the CTE study as a sample of football players' brains. But this sample is extremely biased. To be in the CTE s tudy, someone's brain had to be donated by their family. Why would a family do that? In most cases, they did it because the person had cognitive and mood problems, i.e. symptoms of CTE. So probably CTE (measured feature) was more common among donated (sam ple feature) football player brains, and the statistic (\"almost all\") is an overestimate. - 204 - PRACTICE EXAM 3 1) Answer (b) - Although t he confidence levels are unstated and this normally means 95%, it is impossible for both arguments to have the same confidence level . The sample sizes are the same but the statistic in argument (b) is less precise (larger MoE), so its confidence level must be higher. 2) Answer Based on the measurement of their sample, they infer 63% support among planned voters, which is high enough for the proposal to pass. However 63% is only 3 pts higher than the support percentage required (3 -to-2 = 60%) . At any normal or useful confidence level (e.g. 95%), a sample size of 115 has a margin of error larger than that. Since a failing s upport percentage (59%) is well within the margin of error of this statistic, the campaign should not be so sure that the dung beetle will be Azmakia's new national arthropod. 3) Answer a) Population : Wackadoodle gadgets Measured feature : defective Sample feature : made by new employee Sample size : 320 MoE: \u00b14 pts Confidence level : 95% (assumed) b) Evaluation : This argument is bad because it uses a biased sample. Bob is a new employee still learning how to do his job well . Probably defects are more common among Bob's gadgets . [Also correct: Bob's gadgets are more likely to be defective .] Probably 16% is an overestimate.

A cause produces an effect (makes it happen or exist ). The effect happens after or together with the cause . Many normal sentences can be restated as explicit causal statement s. Statement 1 0.1: Abby's smartphone distracts her while she is driving. Statement 10.1 (explicit causal statement ): Abby's smartphone causes her to be distracted while driving. Many explanations are causal claims. Statement 10. 2: The dog barked because it saw a cat. Statement 10. 2: (explicit causal statement ): Seeing a cat caused the dog to bark. Some causes are preventions . The effect they produce is a lack or reduction of something. Statement 10.3: The HPV vaccine prevents cervical cancer in women. Statement 10. 3 (explicit causal statement ): The HPV vaccine causes women to not get cervical cancer. Vocabulary : The word cause is not the word because , but because often indicates an explanation, and many explanations are causal statements. \"A because B\" often means \"B caused A\". - 207 - The Method of Difference Causal reasoning often uses the method of difference . Method of Difference Argument Pattern Main Argument A is different when B is different. There are no other relevant difference s besides A. A causes B. Sub-argument C is the same when B is different. Etc. There are no other relevant difference s besides A. Argument 1 0.4: Normally Abby does n't text while driving, and she drives well, but today she text ed her friend and she crashed. She was n't driving in the rain for the first time and wasn't trying to avoid hitting a n animal on the road. So texting caused her to crash. To reconstruct Argument 10.4, we need to recognize an implicit intermediate conclusion : \"There were No Other Relevant Differences (besides texting) when Abby crashed.\" Main Argument Sub-argument [A differen t B different. ] [NORD (besides A).] [A caused B.] Since the method of difference depends on (or works best when) finding the only relevant difference , it can be criticized if we notice another difference that seems relevant (a possible cause). What is relevant? Th at can only be judged based on background information about the effect. There is also a method of agreement : A is the same when B is the same, therefore A causes B. This may be understood as a method of searching for something we expect would be the only relevant difference between B situations and non -B situations . - 208 - ii. -CAUSE AND EFFECT - To show a causal explanation (A causes B; B is an effect of A) , we'll draw a cause -and-effect diagram. A B To show prevention (A causes B to not happen ), we'll cross out B in the diagram. A B Multiple c auses and effects may be ordered in a causal chain . Most things have more than one cause and more than one effect. Abby distracted while driving Distracted while driving - 209 - iii. -EXPLAINING DIFFERENCE - A statistical difference: B is more common among W that have feature A. Why? Three Causal Explanations of a Difference Why is the B rate higher in the A group? Argument 1 0.5: Security cameras are less common in stores with lots of shoplift ing, so shoplifting prevent s security cameras. But maybe the true explanation is the reverse: security cameras prevent shoplifting. A Non-AW [population] B Shoplifting A B A B A B C Shoplifting - 210 - Argument 10. 6: Offices with ping pong tables are more likely to have happy employees, so ping pong tables make employees happy. But maybe there is a common (shared) cause , something that separately causes ping pong tables and happy employees. For example, m aybe nice bosses buy ping pong tables for the office and make employees happy by giving them raises . We can easily eliminate the reverse causal explanation (B causes A) when B happens after A. Causes happen before (or with) their effects , never after them . In cases with no clear time order , and in cases where we think there may be a common cause , eliminating the alternative explanation s require an experiment.

The independent (or manipulated ) variable (A) should be the only relevant difference between the two groups. We measure some feature , the dependent variable (B), in each group. Confounding Factor F Non-F Confounding Factors and Alternative Explanations The chart above shows that B is more common with A, and B is less common without A. A A B B The confounding factor F is anot her difference (besides A) between the A and Non -A groups . It could+ be a common cause of A and B.

Perhaps gender is a confounding factor. Male:Female ratio: 20:80 65:35 There is an alternative explanation : Being female is a common cause. Being female separately causes both cat -video -watching and philosophy -reading . (And b eing male prevents both things .) We need to control for gender : keep the male:female ratio the same in the cat video watcher (experimental) group and non -cat video watcher (control) group. They could be all males, all females, or any other ratio . Then we measure the rates of philosophy -reading again. Is there still a difference ? You're doing a n experimen t...

Possible Experiment Outcomes The philosophy -reading rate is still higher in the cat video group. So gender doesn't matter. This eliminates \"being female\" as a common cause. We now have better evidence than before that watching cat videos causes philosophy reading. Difference Remains Supports : original explanation The difference disappears. Gender matters. This supports \"being female\" as a common cause. Why? Because if it's true, w e should expect equal rates of the effect (philosophy - reading) when there are equal rates of the cause (being female) .

Unknown to us, i n our study population, 240 students (30%) were dropped on their head as a baby : 225 (75%) of the 300 cat -video -watchers and 15 (3%) of the 500 non -cat-video-watchers . Dropped: 225 15 Group total: 300 500 Dropped rate: 75% 3% There's a higher \"dropped\" rate among the cat -video -watchers. Being dropped is a confounding factor. Perhaps it's a common cause of watching cat videos and reading philosophy , and that's why cat -video - watching students are more likely to read philosophy.

A randomized controlled trial (RCT) solves th is problem . Random = every student has 1) an equal chance of being assigned to the experimental group and 2) an equal chance of being assigned the co mparison group. With coin -flip (50:50) randomization, we expect each group to get half (400) of the total students (800) , and half (120) of the dropped students (240): the same 30% dropped rate in both groups. Randomization automatically controls for being dropped. Randomization might not produce exactly 30% and 30% , e.g. we might randomly get 117/403 (29%) and 123/397 (31%). B ut we would be very unlucky to randomly get rates as different as 75% and 3%. Dropped: 120 120 Expected numbers with coin -flip Group otal: 400 400 (50:50) randomization Dropped rate: 30% 30% With adequate sample (group) sizes, we can trust r andomization to automatically prevent confounding factor s. Now is philosophy -reading still more common with cat-video -watch ers? These two chances do not need to be equal to each other - as long as each is the same for every item in the population. So then why coin -flip (50:50) randomization? Why not roll a dice (1/6 chance of assignment to the experimental group; 5/6 chance of assi gnment to the control group)? Coin -flip randomization produces (roughly) equal group sizes. This is the optimal way to minimize the margins of error on both statistics. That's the only reason for the coin rather than the dice. If the sample (gr oup) sizes a re large enough, we could eliminate confounding factors with dice -roll randomization instead.

In this type of explanation , the common cause may be the experiment itself. Example Cloud9 is an airline. Some times their airplanes break and need repair earlier than their normally scheduled maintenance. Cloud9 consider s upgrading their planes with the new JetBlast5000 engine. They hope the J B5000 is more reliable and will prevent early repair need. Before upgrading all their planes, they buy some JB5000 engines and do an experiment . To avoid confounding factors , they randomly install JB5000s on some planes and regular engines on others. JB5000 planes need early repair less often . Cloud9 thinks that the JB5000 prevents early repair need. (Image: Angi Reinschmidt ) But the experiment may have created a new confounding factor . Perhaps Cloud9 told pilots of JB5000 planes to fly at high altitud e because the engines work better there. But the air is less dense . Maybe that prevents stress on the plane parts, preventing early repair need s. If this explanation is right, the JB5000 does not prevent early repair need s. 0%10%20%30%40%50% JB5000 Regular EngineAirplanes Needs Early Repairs EXPERIMENT High altitude flying Stress on plane parts ? - 219 - Randomization of the airplane groups did not control for altitude because the experiment itself (after randomization) caused the JB5000 planes to fly at a higher altitude .

Reconstruct the argument in standard form using the statement numbers. Evaluate the argument . Near Gotham there are two crocodile petting zoos: Acme CrocWorld, and Big World o'Crocs. Acme is near the hot springs, where geothermal heat warms the ponds, while Big World is in Shady Val ley, where there are no hot springs, but visitors enjoy a cool shady park while they pet the crocodiles. Acme and Big World both breed crocodiles. Crocodiles lay eggs in the mud around their waterholes. The hatch rate at Acme is higher than at Big World. B ig World's Board of Directors calls in Zelda, the Zoo Manager , and demands to know why . Zelda says: We've looked at the two petting zoos, and we think we know why Acme 's hatch rate is better. Both zoos give the same amount of water and land space per crocodile, and visitors are kept away from the egg -laying areas where they might accident ally step on the eggs at both parks. However Big World has mainly American crocodiles; Acme has mostly Nile crocodiles, which lay eggs with stronger shells . We think that Nile crocodiles ' stronger eggs make Acme 's hatch rate higher. - 223 - 2) Answer the questions based on the story. Cyclists in Gotham mostly use normal locks , but a new bike lock , SuperLock, is on the market . The company does a survey asking cyclist s what lock they use and if their bike s was stolen in the past 6 months. SuperLock users had their bike s stolen more often (25%) than normal lock users (15%)! Superlock had hoped their lo ck prevented bike theft but it seems to cause bike theft instead ! a) Draw a bar chart of SuperLock's survey data. Draw a cause -and-effect diagram of the explanation they consider. The company thinks of a n alternative explanation for the shocking survey result : maybe dedication to cycling causes some cyclists to buy the expensive SuperLocks, but dedication also causes those cyclists to have their bike s stolen more often (the company can imagine several different possibl e causal chains). b) Draw a cause -and-effect diagram of the alternative explanation that SuperLock imagines. Fill in the causal chain with your own suggestion. The company will do an RCT experiment. The y find 300 cyclists willing to participate . c) Describe the experiment that the company will do. What are the dependent and independent variables? Assume that 90 cyclists have the feature the company imagined might be a confounding factor in the original survey . The company has normal locks in November to begi n the 6 month experiment .

Reconstruct the argument in standard form using the statement numbers. Then answer the questions. The Azmak ian military has been fighting in the country's vast northern region against rebels who want to overthrow the government. The government has a network of 40 outposts throughout the northern region. The military's job is to defend the outposts and chase any rebels they can find. Recently the military has acquired some expensive new flying drones to chase rebels. They have only 10 drones, though, so they use them at the outposts that are surrounded by lots of steep mountains that would be dangerous for soldie rs to guard on foot . After a year, the military reviews data from all the outposts. They say: \"Look at this: the outposts protected by drones were attacked less often than the other outposts (protected only by soldier guards ). We should buy more dron es! It seems that they were the only major difference between the outposts. The drone -protected outposts are just as strategically valuable as the other outposts, and the fences and lights we have around them are no better than we have at the other outposts. The Azmakian taxpayers won't mind that these drones cost 35 million doll ars each.\" a) Reconstruct the argument in standard form . b) Draw a bar chart of the military's data. (The exact numbers are not given and not necessary.) Draw a cause -and-effect diagram of the explanation they have. c) Evaluate their argument . Describ e an alternat ive explanation of their data using details from the story. Show your explanation by d rawing in a cause -and-effect diagram. d) The military didn't think of the explanation you gave above but they want to do a better experiment to be sure that the drones are t ruly effective before they spend the taxpayers' money [Hahaha...]. Describe the experiment they should do. Suppose that 12 of the outposts have the feature you mention in your answer to question ( c). (Hint: Remember that they have only 10 drones.) e) This year they do the better experiment that you described in your answer to question ( d). The drone -protected outposts get attacked less often. Does this fact support the military's original explanation or your alternative? f) They look at the data and see that 40% of the drone -protected outposts were attacked while about 47% of the others were attacked. Does this information affect the answer to question ( e)? Explain why or why not. - 225 - PRACTICE EXAM 3 1) Write the implicit statement and give it a number. Reconstruct the argument in standard form using the statement numbers. Evaluate the argument. To lower its high incarceration rate , Gotham City Council told the city's two prisons to create early release programs. Prison A releas es every prisoner when they've served half their sentence. Prison B was more concerned about endanger ing the community and wanted to do more to stop ex-prisoners from committing new crimes. In the ir program, prisoners who've volunteered for extra duties such as library attendant are rel eased after half their sentence , but they get a tattoo across their chest : (backwards so it's readable in a mirror) After three years, Gotham City Council meets to discuss the programs . \" The data here is pretty convincing. The DON'T COMMIT CRIMES tattoos are the only significant difference between the two groups of early release prisoners . There's no difference in the types of crimes they were c onvicted of, and they're placed in the same types of job programs to help them re -enter society . Moreover conditions in the prisons (presence of gangs, treatment by guards, etc.) are the same . Yet 40% of the prisoners from Prison A commit another crime within a year of their release whereas only 10% of those from Prison B do. We'll hir e a tattoo artist for Prison A.\" - 226 - 2) Answer the questions based on the story. Azmakia Broadcasting Network (ABN) makes comedy shows and is studying people's reactions to them so that they can make more funny shows. They show comedies to focus groups and find a surprising difference between shows with and without a \"laugh track\" (added reco rded laughter): only 40 % of the shows with a laugh track are rated \"funny\" by the focus groups, whereas 75% of the shows without one are rated \"funny\" ! ABN conclude s that, contrary to the TV industry's belief, laugh tracks actually prevent shows from seem ing funny. a) Draw a bar chart of ABN's data. Draw a cause -and-effect diagram of the explanation they consider. But ABN think of an alternative explanation . Perhaps good comedy writers , who write the funniest jokes, also refuse to allow their shows to use laugh tracks (they think the laugh track insults the ir talent as writers) . b) Draw a cause -and-effect diagram of the alternative explanation that ABN imagines. ABN will study this with an RCT. They can edit any show to have or not have a laugh track. They will study 42 shows. c) Describe the experiment that the company will do. What are the dependent and independent variables? Assume that 16 shows have the feature the company imagined might be a confounding factor in the origina l survey. The focus group for the shows with laugh tracks comes to the show testing centre and gives their ratings. The next day the focus group for the shows wit hout laugh track s arrives after the lunchbreak when the centre's receptionist microwaved fish for her lunch . This time ABN finds that shows with laugh tracks are rated funny more often, as the TV industry expects. d) The RCT experiment outcome supports the original | alternat ive explanation. e) Identify a new confounding factor the company created in their experiment. Draw a cause - and-effect diagram of a new explanation of the difference. The diagram must include th e confounding factor you identified, plus one other that you think of . f) How could the company have fixed the RCT experiment by changing the co mparison group? - 227 - -ANSWER KEY - QUICK TEST 1) b 2) a 3) d 4) a 5) b 6) d 7) c PRACTICE EXAM 1 1) Answer Implicit statement : There are no other relevant differences between the zoos besides t he eggshells . Main Argument Sub-argument [A different when B different. ] [No other relevant differences besides A.] [A causes B.] Evaluation : This is a bad method of difference argument . It depends on the claim () that the crocodiles ' eggshells are the only relevant difference between the two zoos. But that statement is false. The zoos are in different kinds of environments. Acme has hot springs but Big World does not. This is another relevant difference , not considered in the sub -argument . Perhaps Acme's hot springs cause the eggs to be health ier which causes the higher hatch rate. Explanation (not required for exam answers) The role that each statement has in the method of difference main argument is given in the answer above in [brackets]. This is not a required part of the answer. 2) a) Answer 0%10%20%30% Use SuperLock Use Normal LockCyclists Bike StolenUse SuperLock Bike Stolen - 228 - Explanation Other correct answers are possible for the chart. For example, the population could be Bikes, the independent variable Locked with SuperLock (vs. Locked with Normal Lock ), and the dependent variable Stolen. b) Answer Explanation The possible confounding factor, Cycling Dedication, is a common cause in this explanation . Another confounding factor, Bu ys a More Expensive Bike, is in the causal chain to the Bike Stolen effect. This is an alternative explanation because there is no causal link between Use SuperLock and Bike Stolen. This diagram refers to the experimental (Superlock) group. The diagram for th e control (Normal lock) group would be the same, but with a over e ach part . Other correct answers are possible for the causal chain. For example, perhaps Cycling Dedication causes people to keep their bikes shinier, or it causes them to take their b ikes to different areas wh ere bike thieves go. c) Answer In their randomized controlled trial, the dependent variable is Bike Stolen and the independent variable is Uses Superlock (vs. a normal lock). T he company randomly (e.g. with a coin flip ) assign s each cyclist to either the experimental (SuperLock) group or the comparison (normal lock) group . With 300 cyclists of which 90 are dedicated, we expect coin -flip randomization to make each group 45/150 (30%) dedicated cyclists. R andomization automatically controls for dedication. d) Answer The RCT experiment outcome supports the original explanation. Cycling Dedication Uses SuperLock Buys a More Expensive Bike Bike Stolen - 229 - Explanation The SuperLock group still has a higher theft rate . Since randomization has (we assume) eliminated confounding factors by control ling for dedication and other things , the SuperLocks may be the only difference , and therefore the cause (however see the next answer!). e) Answer The experiment creates a new co nfounding factor: time of year. The co mparison group (normal locks) is in Winter ; the experimental group (SuperLocks) is in Spring and Summer. The nicer weather might cause people to take their bi ke out more and be targeted by thieves more. Explanation Other correct answers are possible for the causal chain. For example, perhaps demand for stolen bicycles is higher in Spring and Summer, so thieves are more active then. f) Answer The company should run the co mparison group later, during the same period as the experimental group, to eliminate seasonal or weather -related confounding factors. Explanation Since they don't have 150 SuperLocks available in November to run the experimental group in Winter, delaying the co mparison group is the only option. Experiment Uses SuperLock Cycles in Spring/Summer Takes Bicycle Out More Often Bike Stolen - 230 - PRACTICE EXAM 2 a) Answer Implicit statement : The drones prevented attacks on the outposts . Main Argument Sub-argument [A different when B different.] [No other relevant differences besides A.] [A prevents B.] Explanation (not required for exam answers) The role that each statement has in the method of difference main argument is given in the answer above in [brackets]. This is not a required part of the answer. b) Answer Explanation The attack rates aren't given so the bar chart simply shows a lower attack rate for drone -protected outposts. Drone-protected Not Drone-protectedOutposts Attacked Drone protection Attacks - 231 - c) Answer Statement is false. There is another relevant difference between the outposts (a confounding factor in the military's experiment) : the drone -protected outposts are surrounded by steep mountains. The danger to soldiers of walking in these mountains is the reason why those outposts were chosen for drone protection. But the mountains that are dangerous for soldie rs would also be dangerous for rebels and might stop rebels from attacking there. So the steep mountains might be a common cause, causing the drones and preventing the attacks. d) Answer They should do an RCT . Randomly assign each outpost to an experimental (drone) group or a control ( no-drone). Since there are 40 outposts and only 10 drones, they should give each outpost a 1/4 chance (e.g. double heads, flipping two coins) of being assigned to the experimental group - to choose 10. (Each outpost has a 3/4 chance of being assigned to th e comparison group - to choose 30.) Since there are 12 outposts with steep mountains, we expect 25:75 randomization to makes groups with steep mountain rates: 3/10 (30%) and 9/30 (30%). Randomization automatically controls for steep mountains. e) Answer The lower attack rate in experimental (drone) group supports the military's original explanation. This is good evidence that the drones are effective. f) Answer These percentages affect the answer to (e). Although the attack rate is lower in the experimental group, the difference (7 pts) is fairly small . With t he small sample (group) sizes (10 and 30), the margins of error will be so large (at any normal confidence level) that they will significantly overlap. These statistics provide only we ak support for the drones' effectiveness. Steep Mountains Drone Protection Danger to Rebels Attacks - 232 - PRACTICE EXAM 3 1) Answer Implicit statement : The tattoos prevent early released prisoners from committing new crimes. Main Argument Sub-argument [A different when B different.] [No other relevant differences besides A.] [A causes B.] Evaluation : This is a bad method of difference argument. It depends on the claim ( ) that there are no other relevant differences besides the tattoos , but that's false. The prisoners in Prison B's program ha ve volunteered for extra duties in the prison , whereas there 's no special requirements in Prison A's program . That difference is a relevant because it suggests that the Prison B prisoners are especially motivat ed to reform and become goods citizen. Maybe tha t motivation , not the tattoos , causes them to commit new crimes less often. 2) a) Answer Explanation The cause -and-effect diagram shows the prevention explanation , referring to the shows in the Laugh Track group. It's important for question (b) to remember that there 's a corresponding diagram for the No Laugh Track group (although it would be strange to s ay \"No Laugh Track causes shows to be Rated ' Funny'\"). 0%50%100% Laugh Track No Laugh TrackComedy Shows Rated \"Funny\"Laugh Track Show Rated \"Funny\" Laugh Track Show Rated \"Funny\" - 233 - b) Answer Explanation See the explanation for the answer to question (a). The possible confounding factor, Good Comedy Writers, is a common cause in this explanation. Another confounding factor, Funny Jokes, is in the causal chain to the Rated \"Funny\" effect. This is an alternative explanation because there is no causal link be tween No Laugh Track and Rated \"Funny\". This diagram refers to the control (No Laugh Track) group . The diagram for the experimental (Laugh Track) group would be the same but with the switched to the other factors (No Good Comedy Writers the common ca use). c) Answer In their randomized controlled trial, the dependent variable is Rated \"Funny \" and the independent variable is Laugh Track (vs. No Laugh Track ). The company randomly (e.g. with a coin flip) assigns each show to eit her the experimental ( Laugh Track ) group or the control (No Laugh Track ) group. With 42 comedy shows of which 16 have good writers , we expect coin-flip randomization to make the Good Writer rate 8/21 (38%) in each group of shows . Randomization automatically contro ls for good writers . d) Answer The RCT experiment outcome supports the alternative explanation. Explanation The difference in the Rated \"Funny\" rates reverse when (we assume) randomization eliminates confounding factors. Laugh tracks no w make a positive difference. This suggests that the negative difference they originally found in the Rated \"Funny\" rates was caused by some confounding factor (perhaps good comedy writers) , not by the laugh track. Good Comedy Writers Laugh Track Funny Jokes Rated \"Funny\" - 234 - e) Answer The experiment creates a new confounding factor: the microwaved fish. This will make the show testing centre smell of the secretary's leftover fish lunch while the co mparison group (No Laugh Track) watches the shows . The leftover fish smell might put the f ocus group in a bad mood, which prevents them from rating the shows \"funny\". Explanation The diagram refers to the shows in the co mparison group. f) Answer The company should make sure the secretary doesn't microwave her leftover fish lunch before the focus group arrives!
