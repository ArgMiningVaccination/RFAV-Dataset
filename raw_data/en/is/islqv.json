ABSTRACT BACKGROUND. Despite the dangers of vaccine-preventable infections and efforts by health care professionals to promote immunization, parents' resistance to routine childhood immunizations continues to grow. This phenomenon can give rise tofrustration among health care providers, as well as create barriers in providingmedical care to children in need. In response, we developed a CD-ROM-based tutorial that (1) explains the nature and origins of parents' concerns, (2) addressesclinical implications of resistance to immunization, (3) explores ethical and pro-fessional obligations that physicians have toward children and their parents, and(4) discusses how physicians can effectively address parents' concerns. OBJECTIVE. Our goals were to evaluate the tutorial's effectiveness in improving phy- sicians' (1) general knowledge about parents' resistance to childhood immuniza- tions, (2) knowledge of adverse effects of immunization, and (3) attitudes towardparents' resistance to childhood immunization. DESIGN/METHODS. After pretesting, expert review, and revision, the 45-minute Penn State Immunization Project tutorial was pilot tested with pediatric and familymedicine residents at 7 training programs in 4 states (Pennsylvania, New York,Maryland, and Iowa). Knowledge and attitudes were assessed by using a 26-itempretest/posttest, the results of which were then analyzed by using standard statis- tical methods. RESULTS. A total of 122 residents completed the pretest/posttest. Statistically and clinically signicant improvements were seen in residents' general knowledge, knowledge of adverse events, and all 5 attitudinal measures regarding childhoodimmunizations. CONCLUSIONS. The tutorial Addressing Parents Concerns About Childhood Immunizations: A Tutorial for Primary Care Providers is effective in improving resident physicians' general knowledge, knowledge of adverse events, and attitudes. As such, thistutorial has the potential to enhance communication between parents and primarycare providers and, more generally, improve clinicians' response to the growing resistance toward routine childhood immunizations.www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/ peds.2006-2627 doi:10.1542/peds.2006-2627 Key Words immunization, pediatricians,professionalism, education, attitudes Abbreviation PSIP\u2014Penn State Immunization Project Accepted for publication Mar 7, 2007 Address correspondence to Benjamin H.

Though pediatricians and family practice clinicianshave a reputation as friendly and approachable, thereare reports of parents having their concerns over immu- nization dismissed and/or disparaged, sometimes aggres-sively so. 46One recent study found that 24% to 39% of pediatricians reported they would dismiss a child from their practice if the parents refused /H113501 of the recom- mended vaccinations.50It is not clear where these chil- dren would then go. But when parents' concerns are noteffectively addressed, often the end result is that childrendo not get the medical care they need and deserve. To help clinicians better understand and deal with parents' concerns over immunizations, we developed, through the Penn State Immunization Project (PSIP), aCD-ROM entitled Addressing Parents' Concerns about Child- hood Immunizations: A Tutorial for Primary Care Providers . This CD-ROM-based tutorial explains the nature andorigins of parents' concerns, including the historical,ideological, and scientic roots of resistance to immuni-zation. It also addresses clinical implications of resistanceto immunization, ethical and professional obligations physicians have toward children and their parents, andhow physicians can effectively address parents' concerns(see Table 1) The 2 primary goals of this tutorial are toincrease knowledge and change attitudes about parentalresistance to routine childhood immunizations. The main target audience for the tutorial are primary care providers in their last stage of training (ie, pediatricand family practice residents, nurse practitioner stu-dents, etc), and community providers. METHODS Before developing the PSIP tutorial, we conducted acomprehensive review of (1) English-language profes- sional and lay literature on opposition to childhood vac-cinations (using PubMed, Google Scholar, and an exten-sive review of complementary and alternative medicine publications) 51; (2) immunization handbooks and re- lated government-sponsored educational materials from Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and the UnitedStates; and (3) online resources from organizations bothin support of (eg, World Health Organization, National Network for Immunization Information, AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics) and opposition to (eg, NationalVaccine Information Center) vaccination. We identied allegations levied against routine child- hood immunization practices, examined common re-sponses to these challenges, and surveyed the relevantTABLE 1 Overview of PSIP Tutorial 1.

Priorities PEDIATRICS Volume 120, Number 1, July 2007 19 at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from literature on risk communication and conflict manage- ment. We then used these themes to develop an alpha-version of the computer-based tutorial, and after obtain-ing institutional review board approval, tested it with aconvenience sample of pediatric residents at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center. This testing includedboth a written pretest/posttest instrument (developedfor this project) and a standardized patient exercise inwhich residents were videotaped (preintervention andpostintervention) interacting with mothers (actually,paid actors) who resisted having their infants immu-nized. Based on test results and feedback from residents,we rened the alpha version of the tutorial and devel-oped a beta version that was reviewed by experts in adult education, medical education, and professional de-velopment, as well as a group of 8 practicing pediatri-cians. Revisions were incorporated into the nal 45-minute PSIP tutorial, which was then pilot tested with aconvenience sample of pediatric and family medicineresidents at 7 training programs in 4 states (Pennsylva-nia, New York, Maryland, and Iowa). The present ver-sion was delivered in a lecture format by the author;however, a freestanding version of the CD-ROM-basedtutorial is in its nal stage of development. Residents' knowledge and attitudes were assessed be- fore and after the intervention using a written 26-itemself-administered instrument. Twelve items assessed general knowledge about immunizations, such as immu-nization rates, impact of physician response on parentalbehavior, sources of opposition to vaccination, laws con-cerning immunization, and so on. Eight items assessedknowledge of adverse events from vaccination (provenversus alleged). All 20 of these items used a true/false/would-be-guessing scale. In addition to recording correctand incorrect responses, we also wanted to assess themagnitude of change, including responses of uncertainty(ie, would be guessing). As such, changes in preinter-vention versus postintervention responses were gradedas shown in Table 2. Five additional items used a 5-point Likert scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree) to measure resi-dents' attitudes regarding (1) the nature and etiology ofparents' resistance to vaccination and (2) the appropri-ateness of physician responses to such resistance. Eachincrement of change along this scale toward the \"de- sired\"* attitude was measured as /H110011, and each incre- ment of change away from the desired attitude wasmeasured as /H110021. Thus, the score for each item could range from /H110024t o/H110014. The mean change for each item was calculated by summing the positive and negativeamounts of change, and averaging this sum by the num-ber of individuals who changed their responses from thepretest to posttest. Because of how results were subse-quently grouped, some changes (eg, from agree tostrongly agree) may not be transparent in the aggregatereport of pretest versus posttest results. The nal testitem identied the respondent's residency discipline and year. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Changes in preintervention versus postintervention re-sponses were calculated as described in \"Methods.\" De-scriptive statistics were generated including means, me-dians, and SDs for change variables and frequency tablesfor the original pretest and posttest responses. Differ-ences between residency year/type and the outcomemeasures were characterized by using contingency tableanalysis; signicance levels were determined by Pear-son's /H92732statistic and 2 sample ttests. RESULTS In the 7 residency programs surveyed, there was a totalof 281 residents. Of these, 122 (43%) were able to attend the lecture presentation, 100% of whom completed thepretest/posttest. Table 3 describes their distribution interms of year and program. Residents' general knowledge improved signicantly postintervention on 11 of 12 items (Table 4). Overall,91% of postintervention responses were correct, com-pared with 50% of preintervention responses (see Fig 1).Fifty percent of the residents changed their responsefrom pretest to posttest, with a mean change of /H110010.84 on a/H110021t o/H110011 scale. There were no statistically signicant *A given attitude was determined to be \"desired\" on the basis of existing evidence regarding immunization and risk (see refs 2, 12, 13, 23, 25, 41, 42, 44, 48, and 54), expert advice (see refs 2, 9, 27, 30, 46, 49, 50, 55, 60, 69, 71, and 73), and American Academy of Pediatrics policy (see refs 59 and 61).TABLE 3 Demographics Characteristic n(%) PGY 1 45 (37) PGY 2 34 (28)PGY/H113503 43 (35) Pediatrics 60 (49)Pediatrics/internal medicine 12 (10)Family practice 50 (41)Iowa 29 (24)Maryland 14 (11)New York 42 (34)Pennsylvania 37 (30) PGY indicates postgraduate year.

There were no statistically signicant differencesbased on respondents' year in residency or type of resi-dency program for any of these 5 attitudinal items. Geo-graphic location, however, did matter in several state-to-state comparisons, with respondents from New Yorkprograms often showing less of a mean positive change.This was particularly true regarding the justiability ofrefusing to provide care to those whose parents resistedimmunization, with residents based in New York having a mean change of /H110010.06 compared with a mean change of/H110011.53 for residents from the other 3 states ( P/H11005.002). DISCUSSIONOur educational tutorial was very successful in improv-ing pediatric and family practice residents' generalknowledge and knowledge of adverse events regardingchildhood immunizations. Although some residentswere well informed about the historical and ideologicalorigins of parents' resistance to vaccination, most werenot. The majority was unfamiliar with resources foraccurate information, the nature of the reporting systemfor adverse events, physician involvement in the anti-vaccine movement, and the status of philosophical ob-jections to immunization. A large portion of residentslikewise had inaccurate beliefs about many of the clinicalfeatures that are (or are not) associated with routinechildhood immunizations. On all but 3 of the clinical measures, posttest knowl- edge improved signicantly. For the 2 of 3 that did not(fever and seizures), it was subsequently noted that thewording and layout of the items in question lent them-selves to misinterpretation. In the case of \"Fever /H11022102\u00b0F (incidence 5%-10%),\" for example, 100% of respon- dents got this wrong on the posttest (the correct inci- dence being /H110111%), presumably because the notation \"(5%-10%)\" had too small a font. That said, the com-bined knowledge posttest scores were signicantly im-proved on 17 of 20 items.Having a solid understanding of the clinical and con- textual features that gure into parents' resistance to immunization is crucial to respond appropriately to wor-ried parents, the majority of whom simply are concernedabout potential downsides of immunization and are con- fused about what and whom to believe. 30,49,52-54 For those parents who resist/oppose immunization because of well-dened philosophical, religious, and/or alternativehealth beliefs, primary care providers must also under-stand the historical, ideological, and scientic roots of resistance to immunization. 11-13,49,52,55 Our tutorial ad- dresses these issues. It also addresses the clinical impli- cations of resistance to immunization, how to commu-nicate risk, how to deal with conflict that may arise, 56-58 and how to identify reliable resources. Lastly, our tuto-rial discusses ethical and professional obligations withregard to children and parents, and how to effectivelyand respectfully help put parents' concerns into con-text. 59-61 Physicians are trained to be on the lookout for bad outcomes (including infectious disease) and to do whatis feasible to prevent them. So, perhaps it is not toosurprising that when a safe and effective tool such asimmunizations is available, many physicians react with surprise if not consternation that someone would rejectthis offer of protection. The section of the tutorial onethical and professional responsibilities is meant to ad-dress the tendency among some physicians to dismissparents' concerns as simply ignorant and/or confronta-tional. Research has shown that how we choose to respond to parents' concerns about immunizations signicantlyaffects the course of action that parents choose, the partnership we have with them, and hence the quality ofhealth care their children receive. 15,55,60,62-65 A recent ar- ticle examining parents' experiences and decisions re- garding immunizations provided the following depictionas not uncommon for parents who resist having theirchildren immunized: \"You just feel really painted into a corner and there's really no support in the medical com-munity. I went through. . .a dozen doctors who werejust like, 'I will not treat you if you're not going toimmunize your child'.\" 46Nor are such professional reac- tions rare.50,66,67 Signicant numbers of physicians hold that failure to immunize is tantamount to child abuse,66,67and in 1 study the majority of county health directors believed that criminal charges and injunctionsshould be brought against parents for failing to immu-nize their child. 59,61,68 For those who wish to better understand why it is a parent's right (and responsibility) to decide what is intheir child's interests, including immunization, there is agrowing literature that deals specically with the ethicsof immunization. 61,69-74 Having already put into context how and why parents may have arrived at their resis-tance to immunization, the PSIP tutorial educates health PEDIATRICS Volume 120, Number 1, July 2007 23 at Amer Acad of Pediatrics on June 12, 2008 www.pediatrics.org Downloaded from care providers about relevant ethical and professional norms, and further explains how to work with suchparents in ways that are respectful and effective. It is in this regard that the success of our tutorial is perhaps best demonstrated, namely, changes in attitude. After the tutorial, participants not only viewed parents'resistance as more understandable and less unreason-able, given what parents had been exposed to, but alsowere more likely to believe that we are not profession-ally justied in refusing to care for children whose par-ents oppose routine childhood immunizations. On thisnal measure, 45% of participants reported somechange in their attitudes toward parents who opposeimmunizations, with only 15% maintaining that it is justied to refuse care because of opposition to immu-nization, compared with 32% before the tutorial. If thenumbers from et 50are gener- alizable, namely, that 24% to 39% of physicians are willing to dismiss from their practice children whoseparents refuse some or all immunizations, then our tu-torial has the potential to help many physicians build more effective partnerships with the growing number ofparents who resist immunizations. Developing and nurturing a strong relationship with parents establishes trust, and without trust there is littlewe can do to help children and their parents. In a studythat examined decision-making about vaccines, motherswho resisted immunization reported that despite seekinga trusting relationship with traditional pediatricians theyfelt alienated and turned away. 46As all pediatricians know, immunization is seldom an urgent matter. In the presence of a trusting relationship, we can normalize theissue as one of many we need to address, and reframeparents' resistance in terms of our common interest in their child's well-being. Our tutorial is designed to helpphysicians accomplish this goal. We know from research that doctors who communi- cate effectively and respectfully are more likely to havetheir patients follow their recommendations and lesslikely to be sued. 27,46,62,75-78 Our tutorial is not itself a tool for developing physicians' communication skills, but it is intended to both provide tools to help them communi-cate with parents who resist immunization, and remindphysicians that it is the job of parents to worry, and it is our job to help them gure out what to worry about. LIMITATIONS There are several limitations to this study. First, thecalculations of mean change on the general knowledgeand knowledge of adverse events items do not accountfor those who did not change their answer pretest toposttest. Second, the present study only examinedknowledge and reported attitudes immediately before and after the intervention, not longitudinally. Thus, it isnot clear how long the observed changes last. Third,because the study did not examine actual practice habits,it is not known how much behavior would change be- cause of this intervention. In pilot testing of the alphaversion of the tutorial, this was addressed with the use ofvideotaped interactions with \"mock moms\" preinterven-tion and postintervention, including controls who had 2preintervention encounters to control for improvementon repetition. Additional such testing would strengthenthe present ndings. Fourth, because of time and samplesize constraints, the present study did not record demo-graphic variables, and so cannot identify outcome differ-ences between men and women, ethnic/racial groups,age cohorts, previous experience with parents, and soon. Fifth, the study included only residents, not board-certied physicians. Thus, it is not clear whether the current ndings are generalizable to pediatricians andfamily medicine physicians out in practice. Additionalstudies are underway to examine this. CONCLUSIONS Routine childhood immunizations are among the mosteffective preventive health measures of the modern era.Despite their remarkable success, along with the veryreal dangers of vaccine preventable illnesses, there isgrowing concern among parents over the appropriate-ness of immunization. Our tutorial is an educationalintervention designed to help physicians better under- stand the nature and origins of parents' concerns, appre-ciate relevant ethical and professional issues, and de-velop a respectful and effective approach for workingwith parents who resist immunization. The tutorial isintended to be presented in person to physicians or otherprimary care providers and has sufcient support mate-rials as to allow an interested individual to prepare him-self or herself to give the presentation. Our data showthat our tutorial is a very effective intervention for res-ident physicians. Additional study needs to be done to determine whether it is equally effective for physicians(and/or other primary care providers) already in prac-tice.
