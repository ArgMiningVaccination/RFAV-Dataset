As parents, we all strive to educate ourselves on the multitude of choices we are presented with daily and make the best decision for our kids. I know first hand how daunting this can be especially for first time parents. At Aloha Natural Medicine, we are passionate about empowering parents with unbiased information, resources and tools in order for parents to feel confident in making informed decisions for the health of their children and families. In order to provide the best health care possible, we want to get to know your family and understand your unique family dynamics and health concerns. We listen to you and your child to understand their complete health picture in order to determine underlying causes. We believe in doing more than simply addressing your child's symptoms. We strive to restore health naturally by providing gentle, safe, and effective recommendations aimed at treating the cause. Our compassionate, collaborative approach offers you and your child a safe forum to discuss your child's health and medical decisions. Together we will develop individualized treatment plans that work for your child and your family. We want your child to thrive! Pediatric visits at Aloha Natural Medicine include discussing nutrition and lifestyle choices, how to prevent common illnesses, how to address common and more complex childhood health problems, vaccinations, developmental milestones, and what to expect in the months and years to come. Bring your questions to these visits and we will discuss your child, your interests and your concerns in depth.
