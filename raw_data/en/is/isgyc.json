The state of energy is subtle. It's the unseen presence but can be felt everywhere, in everything and in all ways. When we tap into \"energies\" we are sensing beyond what we know and into a system that becomes the outline before the outcome. Yet, energy is pliable enough to go with the flow and change according to its' own source and innate intelligence. When you work with your energy, your moving in the direction of your original blueprint. Your inherent spiritual identity, who you were created to be before any traumas, slights, and interactions that took you off course or out of alignment and further away, from your natural source of being. There are many forms of energy we interact with on a daily basis and we're equipped with inner-systems that help us discern which energies are life-giving and productive and others that might be depleting and destructive. As we navigate through experience we feel, take in more breath and connect with our Divine nature that reflects the soul-self in a natural state of being. It is the homecoming and return back to the balance of who we are. Healing is a matter of remembrance, bringing back to the center of who you are, in your natural state of wholeness. It resides within an open heart and the willingness to be close with your spirit. So close, that you hear its' deepest pangs inside your bones and that reverberation, becomes your calling. When you work towards healing, you merge the heart with soul and recognize that they are one. It's the re-connection of your true self and an intimate understanding of the \"self-less\" being, in all it's wisdom. You acknowledge what exists already inside you and take action when you hear the call. This is where your healing becomes your healer.
