With a 57.1% increase from the previous year, their 2019 sales account for 7.5% of their consolidated net sales of 5.72 billion yuan (US$806 million). Pien Tze Huang's current favorable condition is due to their clear emphasis on young people as their target. In December 2018, they released a PR video titled \"Don't call me a Jie (Lady), call me a XiaoJieJie (Young Lady)\". It featured a group of three women singing about their skin-related troubles. Views of the video on Weibo surpassed 230,000, and the company even opened an account on Douyin.

Its championing of Pu'Er and with a third of its founding members being an ethnic Chinese woman, makes Cha Ling a particularly admirable success story. It also helps that Guerlain CEO Boillot is passionate about Chinese culture. Mix of well-known European brand and traditional Chinese medicine in marketing makes Cha Ling successful in the market. Cha Ling is also the first cosmetics house to integrate the anti-oxidant, anti-ageing and anti-pollution properties of Pu'Er tea from forests that are thousands of years old in China's Yunnan province.
