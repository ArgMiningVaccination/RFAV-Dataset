Head for Education2LIGO interferometer operating at design sensitivity with application to gravitational radiometry by Stefan W. Ballmer Submitted to the Department of Physics on May 3rd, 2006, in partial fulllment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy Abstract During the last decade the three interferometers of the Laser Interferometer Gravi- tational Wave Observatory (LIGO) were built and commissioned. In fall 2005 design sensitivity was achieved, corresponding to a strain sensitivity of 2 .5\u00d71023Hz1/2 at 150 Hz. All three interferometers are now in an extended science run. One of the most critical steps to reach this goal was increasing the power in the interferometer to more than 200 Watt at the beam splitter. This required the commissioning of both a thermal compensation system and shot noise limited sensing electronics capable of detecting all the light. Additionally, a series of unexpected noise sources had to be mitigated. This work is described in the rst part of this thesis. In a second part I introduce a radiometer analysis that is capable of spatially resolving anisotropies in a stochastic gravitational wave background. The analysis is optimized for identifying point sources of stochastic gravitational radiation. Finally, data from the fourth LIGO science run is used to set both isotropic and directional upper limits on the stochastic background of gravitational waves. The bound set on the normalized gravitational wave energy density is h2gw(f)< 6.25\u00d7105and the limit set on a broadband and flat strain power spectrum coming from a point source varies between 8 .5\u00d71049Hz1and 6.1\u00d71048Hz1, depending on the source position. Additionally a limit on gravitational radiation coming from the direction of Sco-X1, the brightest X-ray source short of the sun, is set for each frequency bin. Thesis Supervisor: Erotokritos Katsavounidis Title: Professor Thesis Co-Supervisor: Peter Fritschel Title: Principal Research ScientistAcknowledgments I had the privilege to join the LIGO project in the nal phase of interferometer commissioning, and was given the chance to work on what is arguably the biggest table-top experiment a physics graduate student can dream of working on. As a consequence I had the pleasure to work with many great people from the project, probably learning something from each and every one of them. As much as I would like to do it, thanking all of them personally would ll too many pages of an already too long thesis. But even so I want to take this opportunity to mention at least a few of them by name. To Rana, thanks for showing me how to solder a cable and how to wire up an op-amp. To Paul, thanks for teaching the beauty of RF electronics to the 21st century youth. To Peter, thanks for teaching me the dierence between AS I and AS Q.

To the whole Hanford crew, thank you all for the hospitality and support I enjoyed. And sorry for all those sleepless night I have caused for some of you... I would also like to thank Edith for the many beautiful moments we shared when- ever we were not working on opposite sides of the Atlantic ocean. Finally, I want to express my deep gratitude to my parents, Ruth and Werner Ballmer, for all the love and care I enjoyed in the last thirty one years of my life. Without them this thesis would never have been written. - Stefan, May 3, 20066Contents Preface 15 1 Gravitational Radiation 17 1.1 Gravitational Radiation an anisotropic background of gravitational waves 75 Appendices 116 A Tables of Parameters 117 B Useful formulas and denitions the TCS noise coupling 133 D.1 Estimate noise displacement . . 41 2-4 Fringe of the double cavity . . . since the existence of gravitational waves was rst predicted by Albert Einstein in 1918 [ 1], the experimental challenge to directly measure their eect was daunting. It was clear that the laboratory generation of gravitational waves strong enough for the experimental verication of Einstein's prediction is virtually impossible - by far the largest wave amplitudes are due to rare collisions of stellar-sized compact objects. It took more than 40 years before J. Weber made the rst serious attempt to directly measure their eect using a resonant bar detector [ 25]. Then, in 1975, the discovery of the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16 by Hulse and Taylor [ 2,3] provided a laboratory with which the emission of gravitational waves could be tested. Over the years their data indeed showed a decrease in the orbital period of the binary, consistent with the energy loss predicted by the emission of gravitational waves, proving, albeit indirectly, the existence of gravitational waves. The potential payo of directly measuring gravitational waves would be enormous. Gravitational waves are created during the rst fraction of a second after the big bang, or originate at the core of stellar collisions or explosions. Exactly because they interact so little with matter, they penetrate the surrounding matter that is responsible for emission of electromagnetic radiation, so far the only carrier of information about such events. Directly observing gravitational waves therefore would literally open a new window to the universe. Today, 88 years after Einstein's prediction, nobody has yet succeeded in directly detecting gravitational waves. However, during the last decade a handful of kilome- ter scale, laser interferometer gravitational wave antennae were constructed, commis- sioned and have begun operation. This worldwide network of observatories includes 15the German-British GEO6001[40], the Japanese TAMA2[41], the Italian-French VIRGO3[46] and a set of three interferometers in the United States called Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO)4[42,45]. Personally I had the privilege to join the LIGO laboratory for the last ve years of the initial interferometer commissioning phase. I spent almost 2 years at the LIGO Hanford Observatory in Washington State, where I spearheaded the day-to- day commissioning of the 4km interferometer. This was diverse and exceptionally rewarding work. Of course the main goal was to improve the interferometer strain sensitivity, but due to the intertwined complexity of the LIGO interferometers I had to become familiar with almost every subsystem. This also meant working together with many people from across the whole the project, all of them experts on their own subsystem. I would like to use this opportunity to thank all of them; I learned a lot from them. After an introduction to gravitational waves in chapter 1, I summarize the key hardware improvements that were made while I was working at the LIGO Hanford Observatory in chapter 2. They were the last steps required to reach the design sensitivity laid out more than a decade ago [ 39]. In chapter 3I introduce an analysis that uses the data from the two LIGO sites to set a directional upper limit on stochastic gravitational background radiation. Finally, in chapter 4, I report on the results of this analysis from the LIGO S4 Science Run. This work, and the LIGO Laboratory, is supported by the United States National Science Cooperative Agreement PHY-0107417. 1http://www.geo600.uni-hannover.de 2http://tamago.mtk.nao.ac.jp 3http://www.virgo.infn.it Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity established Lorentz invariance as the fundamental symmetry of space and time. It became clear that Isaac New- ton's law of gravitation needed to be extended since it included instantaneous action at a distance, which violates of causality in the framework of Lorentz invariance. All attempts to modify Newton's theory to comply with Lorentz invariance necessarily include a nite propagation speed of gravitational phenomena. In that sense already the Special Theory of Relativity suggests the existence of gravitational waves. Fur- thermore it is also no surprise that such waves should propagate at the speed of light, for this is the only Lorentz invariant velocity. The exact properties of such gravitational waves however were only predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, and were worked out in his 1918 article \" \u00a8Uber Gravitationswellen\" [ 1]. The following section is a quick review to this prediction. I chose to do it formally because this highlights how few assumptions actually go into its derivation. 1.1 Gravitational Radiation in General Relativity The big philosophical leap that lead Einstein to the General Theory of Relativity was insight that one has to abandon the view of space-time as an unalterable stage on which the universe evolves. Instead space-time itself becomes a dynamic eld that is 17influenced by the matter floating in it. Euclidean geometry is no longer appropriate. Following the ideas of Bernhard Riemann such a curved space-time can be de- scribed by a metric g\u00b5, which is a function of the coordinates \u00b5= (t,x1,x2,x3): the innitesimal distance or eigen time dbetween 2 events (points) separated by d\u00b5is given by d2=d\u00b5g\u00b5d(1.1) The metric g\u00b5is a dynamic eld. In the limit of special relativity the metric g\u00b5 becomes the Minkowski metric \u00b5= diag( 1,1,1,1). 1.1.1 The linearized Einstein Equation The Einstein equation is a 2nd order dierential equation for the metric tensor g\u00b5. It determines the evolution of g\u00b5under the influence of matter, which in turn is described by the stress tensor T\u00b5: G\u00b5(g\u00b5) = 8GT \u00b5 (1.2) Here G is Newton's constant and the 2nd order dierential operator G\u00b5is called Einstein tensor. The derivation of an explicit expression for G\u00b5was one of the central results of Einstein. Since we are interested in describing gravitational waves far away from any source we can use the weak eld limit, dened by g\u00b5=\u00b5+h\u00b5,|h\u00b5| /lessmuch1 (1.3) where\u00b5is again the Minkowski metric. Then the Einstein tensor G\u00b5becomes linear and is given by 2G\u00b5=h\u00b5,+h\u00b5 ,+h ,\u00b5\u00b5h ,+\u00b5h,h,\u00b5 (1.4) In the last term his the trace of h\u00b5, i.e.h=h\u00b5 \u00b5. 18While this looks complicated at rst glance it is surprisingly simple to see why this has to be the correct expression: Newton: Since the theory has to be an extension of Newton's work, we know that there has to be a Laplace operator acting on the quantity that describes the gravitational eld ( h\u00b5). The Lorentz-invariant extension is the D'Alembert operator /intersectionsq=2 t /triangle. This is the 1st term in equation 1.4. Energy-Momentum conservation: It implies 0 = 8 GT \u00b5,=G\u00b5,. This re- quires the 2nd term in equation 1.4. SinceT\u00b5and therefore G\u00b5are symmetric in\u00b5and, we also need the 3rd term. But this 3rd term also has to be canceled. Applying the same argument again thus gives rise to the 4th term. Covariance: The Einstein equation has to be invariant under any coordinate transformations, in particular innitesimal ones of the form x\u00b5=x\u00b5+\u00b5. For thoseh\u00b5transforms as h\u00b5=h\u00b5\u00b5,,\u00b5. Requiring that the Einstein tensor is invariant under these transformations leads to term 5 (to cancel term 4) and term 6 (to cancel terms 2 and 3). Terms 5 and 6 together also fulll the Energy-Momentum conservation criterion. 1.1.2 The transverse-traceless gauge To see the physical eect of a gravitational wave it is useful to x the gauge. The most practical choice is to introduce the trace-inversed strain h\u00b5 h\u00b5=h\u00b51 2\u00b5h (1.5) and impose the harmonic gauge condition (transversality) h, \u00b5= 0 (1.6) 19This reduces the Einstein equation to a simple wave equation: G\u00b5=1 2/intersectionsqh\u00b5= 8GT \u00b5 (1.7) Furthermore if we now focus on a region of space outside the source we have T= 0, which allows us to impose the even stricter transverse-traceless gauge, dened by the following 2 conditions: h\u00b5,= ) 0 assures that the trace-inversed strain h\u00b5is identical to the physical strain h\u00b5. 1.1.3 Plane wave solution and eect on free masses To visualize the eect of a gravitational wave on free (inertial) masses in space we can look at a plane wave solution of equation 1.7with wave vector k: h\u00b5(x) =\u00afh\u00b5cos/parenleftbig kx/parenrightbig (1.9) We havekk= 0 since solutions 1.7travel at light speed and \u00afh\u00b5k= 0, \u00afh\u00b5 \u00b5= 0 due to the transverse traceless condition 1.8. Choosing the wave vector kialong the z-axis we can parametrize the amplitude \u00afh\u00b5as \u00afh\u00b5= 0 0 0 0 0h+h\u00d70 0h\u00d7h+0 0 0 0 0 (1.10) i.e. we have two independent polarizations, h+andh\u00d7. Let's further assume 2 test masses separated by the distance Lalong the X-axis before the wave hit. The test 20mass separation while the wave is passing is then given by L+dL=/radicalbig LgxxL/parenleftbigg 1 +h+ 2/parenrightbigg L (1.11) while we get a minus sign for a separation along the y-axis. In other words a gravi- tational wave with h+polarization stretches distances along the x-axis and shortens distances along the y-axis during the rst half period and does the opposite during the second half period. The h\u00d7polarization does the same thing, but in a coordinate system rotated by 45 degree. The best way of measuring a gravitational wave strain therefore is to compare the arm length dierence between two perpendicular arms. Choosing the two arms along x and y-axis the arm length dierence is given by LxLy=h+L (1.12) Comparing the length of two perpendicular arms conveniently is exactly what a Michelson interferometer does. 1.2 Gravitational Wave Sources 1.2.1 Quadrupole radiation and signal strength Just as electric charge conservation implies that there is no electromagnetic monopole radiation, the energy-momentum conservation T\u00b5 ;= 0 implies that there is no monopole or dipole gravitational radiation. Working in the near Newtonian approxi- mationT\u00b5 ;= 0 dt2/integraldisplay dx3T00xixj. (1.13) 21Since equation 1.7is a regular wave equation its far eld solution at distance dis the retarded eld given by hij=4G d/integraldisplay dx3Tij ret (1.14) Applying identity 1.13 and projecting to the transverse traceless gauge we quadrupole momentum Iij=/integraltext dx3(x)xixj. From equation 1.15 it is also immediately clear that there is no chance of observing gravitational waves from a terrestrial source. The strain hTT ijis also related to the |h+,0|2+|h\u00d7,0|2/angbracketrightbig (1.16) The result has to be averaged over several wavelength to be physically meaningful, which is indicated by the angle brackets /angbracketleft.../angbracketright. Finally the power radiated by the whole source can be obtained by integrating over all directions P=G 5c5/angbracketleftBig... so the radiated power is proportional to the square of the power Pinternal flowing internally from one side of the source to the other. The existence of gravitational waves has been conrmed indirectly by Hulse and Taylor [ 2,3,4], resulting in the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics. They observed a shift 22in the perihelion passing time of the binary pulsar system PSR 1913+16 that was perfectly explained by the loss of energy and angular momentum due to the emission of gravitational waves. 1.2.2 Expected astrophysical sources Inspiral of a compact binary Any two stars orbiting each other will loose energy by radiating gravitational waves at a rate given by dE dt=32 5c5 G\u00b52M3 a5f(/epsilon1) (1.18) whereM=M1+M2is the f(/epsilon1) eccentricity [ 7], page 988). Thus both period and semi-major axis awill shrink resulting in a chirp with ff11/3, with the gravitational wave frequency f equal to twice the orbital frequency. The 2 stars merge when the sum of their radii becomes comparable to their separation, R1+R22a. Thus the chirp signal ends roughly = 15 Hz/parenleftbigg1000km R1+R2/parenrightbigg3 2/parenleftbiggM 2M/parenrightbigg1 2 .(1.20) Even if only one of the stars is a white dwarf ( R1106m,M1=M) this frequency is already outside the band accessible to LIGO (starting roughly above 40Hz, see chapter 2). Thus LIGO can only see binary inspirals where both stars are either a neutron star (NS,Ri104m,Mi= 1.4M) or a black hole (BH, RiRISCO = 6GM ic2). 23In both cases fmaxcan be as high as about 6 kHz. During the inspiral phase the NS/NS wave forms are believed to be suciently well modeled by post-Newtonian approximation that they can be used for matched ltering [ 21,89]. For BH/BH wave forms the condence is not as big [ 22]. Nevertheless matched ltering is usually applied. All of these post-Newtonian wave forms become inaccurate during the nal phase (merger). So far no accurate wave forms for the merger phase is known. This is especially unfortunate since the radiated power reaches a maximum during this merger phase. The product of such a merger is most likely a black hole. Just after being born this black hole will still be excited and undergo damped oscillations that will also radiate gravitational waves [ 18]. NS/NS inspiral rate estimate The NS/NS merger rate in our Galaxy was estimated to be about 83 Myr1using a population model that was based on all known NS/NS systems [ 23,24]. The uncertainty on this estimate is rather large - the 95 % interval spans values from 4 Myr1to 220 Myr1. This translates into a detection rate ( SNR > 8) for LIGO at design sensitivity of 1 per 30 years, with the most optimistic value consistent with the 95 % interval being 1 per 8 years. Periodic sources Another potential source of gravitational waves are fast spinning non-axis-symmetric pulsars. Fast spinning pulsars are often referred to as Millisecond Pulsars because their period is only a couple milliseconds long. These sources will produce a monochro- matic signal at twice the pulsar frequency. The strength of such a signal is about 500 Hz/parenrightbigg2/parenleftbigg10 Since the pulsar frequencies are extremely stable the best way to look for such signals is to demodulate the data stream at 24the expected frequency, taking into account all eects from polarization and orbital motion of both pulsar and earth. The most interesting pulsars naturally are the fast spinning ones. Those tend to be driven by mass accretion, which in turn can aect the frequency stability. For those objects on can also relate the expected gravitational radiation to the observed X-ray luminosity, see section 3.2.1. Other sources Gravitational waves for which we do not have a template can come from a variety of sources. These include the superposition of an ensemble of the sources described above as well as any other inaccurately modeled sources such as supernovae or even primordial gravitational waves. Phenomenologically one usually divides those sources into bursts and stochastic background, depending on whether they have a nite duration. The boundary be- tween long bursts and a stochastic background however is not well dened. More details on a stochastic background are given in chapter 3. 1.3 Gravitational Wave Detectors A gravitational wave detector must be able to convert a space-time strain into a recordable signal. The whole challenge lies in the weakness of the signal. This section recalls the history of suggested detectors and motivates the optical conguration of the LIGO interferometers. 1.3.1 Bar detectors In 1960 Joseph Weber suggested using the resonance of an aluminum bar as an an- tenna for gravitational waves [ 25]. The idea is that a passing short gravitational wave pulse would induce a strain in the bar and excite its resonance. For reasons de- tailed elsewhere[ 26,27], the community was never able to verify Weber's subsequent 25claims of detection[ 28] although various theories[ 19,20] were developed to explain the enormous apparent flux of gravitational wave energy. Since Weber's pioneering work resonant bar detectors have come a long way. To- day's bar detectors are cryogenically cooled, have much improved seismic isolations and make use of SQUIDs to readout the signal [ 29]. The sensitivity on resonance of such a bar with length l0, massm, resonance frequencyf0and mechanical quality factor Qis limited by thermal excitation of (see for instance [ 8]). In recent years there also have been proposals [ 30] for more sophisticated ge- ometries (spheres, dodecahedrons, etc.) designed to improve the bandwidth and directional sensitivity of the resonant mass detectors [ 31]. 1.3.2 Interferometers Given the eect of a passing gravitational wave (eq. 1.12) a Michelson interferometer is the canonical instrument to measure such an eect. This was rst pointed out by Pirani in 1956 [ 33] and by 1971 a prototype interferometer was built in Malibu [ 34]. 26Shortly after that a study done at MIT by R. Weiss identied almost all noise sources relevant for a LIGO-scale interferometer [ 37,38]. Since then many dierent optical congurations have been suggested (see [ 55] for a summary). The LIGO antennae are inter- ferometers. All of kilometer-scale variant of this optical conguration [ 40,41,42,45,46]. 1.3.3 Remark on interferometer for GW detection Quoting the analogy to the Cosmic Microwave Background (\"the wavelength gets stretched with redshift\"), I was often asked whether such a wavelength stretching would not null out any interferometric readout. Hence this short paragraph: At its heart an interferometric measurement is not a distance measurement but rather a relative timing (or time-of-flight) measurement - it compares the phase of the light reflected from both arms at the xed location of the photo diode. Furthermore, sincehtt= 0 for all gravitational waves (see 1.10), the evolution of time is not aected by the wave. In other words, a set of clocks that was synchronized before the wave arrived remains synchronized during the event and afterward. Therefore we should analyze the interferometer as follows: A phase front = const starts at the beam splitter, gets split up and travels with light speed (hence the name...) down each arm, gets reflected at each end and arrives back at the beam splitter after tx,y= 2(1\u00b1h+ 2)L c(1.25) i.e. the relative time delay between the 2 arms is t= 2h+L c, which then translates into a phase dierence of = 2 t. The laser frequency is unaected by the gravitational wave ( htt= 0). The analysis above is for the limit of long gravitational wave length (gravitational wave period >light storage time in the arms). The generalization to a time and 27position dependent h+(t,/vector x) is straightforward and gives the position of the phase front in the x-arm / y-arm. Notice that I never had to talk about the laser wavelength. Nevertheless, it is still legitimate to academically ask what happens to the laser wavelength when a gravitational wave passes. The wavelength is the distance between two points that have a phase dierence of 2 . In the static case h+=const and for a newly emitted photon, since the light speed is exactly what it's name suggests, this distance is always given by=c/, independent of h+. If however h+(t) depends on t one can show that the laser wavelength becomes =c /parenleftbigg 1 +1 4h+ t/parenrightbigg (1.27) in 1st order approximation, i.e. it is indeed stretched if h+increases. This however does notresult in a correction to equation 1.26and hence to the strain signal provided by a interferometer. 28Chapter 2 The LIGO interferometer Figure 2-1: Aerial photograph of the LIGO Hanford Observatory An excellent summary of the control system and the relevant noise sources was given by Rana Adhikari in his thesis [ 51]. It captures the state of the LIGO interfer- ometers during the S2 science run. Also, the instrument status during the S1 science run is summarized in [ 49]. 29This chapter is intended to be an update covering the changes in the control system and newly identied noise sources. It is intended to capture the state of the LIGO interferometers at the beginning of the 1-year long S5 science run, even though not all aspects of the LIGO instrument will be covered. At this point all three interferometers show roughly one order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity everywhere above 40Hz compared to S2. Thus I will begin this chapter with a description of the optical layout and the RF readout scheme. I then will move on to the fundamental noise source limiting initial LIGO, namely shot noise, and explain a series of technical noise sources that had to be eliminated during commissioning. After that a big section is lled by the detailed description of the thermal compensation system that had to be installed to deal with thermal aberration in the large optics. Finally I will summarize all the known noise sources that contribute to the interferometer displacement sensitivity. 2.1 Optical layout The three initial LIGO interferometers [ 43,44] are all 32] (see gure 2-2). Two of them, one with 4 km and one with 2 km arm length (labeled H1 and H2), are installed at the LIGO Hanford Observatory in Washington State. The third one (L1) also has an arm length of 4 km and is installed at the LIGO Livingston Observatory in Louisiana. On all interferometers all optics, including input mode cleaner and mode matching telescope mirrors, are freely suspended as pendula, hanging from a platform that is passively seismically isolated. All these optics and seismic isolation stacks are enclosed in a vacuum system. Also, the Livingston interferometer was recently upgraded with a Hydraulic External Pre-Isolation (HEPI) system, i.e. an active seismic isolation systems that is installed outside the vacuum envelope. All freely suspended optics have little magnets glued on. The required actuation forces are applied to those magnets using small coils. The light source for a LIGO interferometer is a 10 Watt Nd:YAG laser from 30Figure 2-2: Optical layout of the LIGO interferometers. The Laser light enters from the left. The gravitational wave signal is sensed at the anti-symmetric or dark port (AS). Shown are the Recycling Mirror (RM), the Beam Splitter (BS), the two Input Test Masses (ITMX/ITMY) and the two End Test Masses (ETMX/ETMY). Carrier light is shown in red, the resonant sideband in blue and the non-resonant sideband in green (only reflected at RM). Indicated are also the reflective or symmetric port (REFL) and the pick-o port (PO), as well as the distances Lx,Ly,lxandly. 31Lightwave, operating at a wavelength of 1064 nm. It is both frequency and intensity stabilized. The output laser light is passed through the pre-mode cleaner, a 21 cm long triangular cavity designed to both lter the spatial mode and the intensity noise above about 1 MHz. Most error signals for controlling the interferometer are derived using a Ponder- motive locking scheme [ 35] (see section 2.2, or [ 48]). Thus the input laser beam is frequency-modulated at three dierent frequencies, producing three sets of All but the mode cleaner sideband then pass the mode cleaner (MC), which is a triangular cavity with 24.492 meters round trip length. The mode cleaner sideband is used to lock the mode cleaner in reflection. The resonant sideband passes 2 free spectral ranges (FSRs) away from the carrier, the non-resonant sideband 5 FSRs away from the carrier. The beam then hits the recycling mirror (RM), which is already part of the main interferometer, see gure 2-2. The non-resonant sideband is just reflected, it is not resonant in any of the cavities of the main interferometer - hence its name. Both carrier and resonant sideband build up in the recycling cavity that is formed by the RM and the 2 Input Test Masses (ITMX and ITMY). The recycling gain is Gcr= 50 for the carrier and Gsb= 26.5 for the sideband. Finally only the carrier is resonant in the arm cavities formed by the ITMs and the end test masses (ETMX and ETMY). The arm cavity nesse is F= 219. The beam splitter (BS) is placed such that (almost) no carrier is exiting at the anti- symmetric port (AS or dark port). Due to the Schnupp asymmetry lxly= 0.356m the sideband leaks out the dark port. Nominally the recycling cavity should be almost critically coupled for the sideband such that almost all sideband should end up on the dark port. The dierential arm (DARM) error signal LxLyis derived from beating sideband and carrier at the dark port. The common arm error signal ( Lx+Ly)/2 (CARM) is derived from beating the carrier at the reflective port (REFL or symmetric port) against either resonant or non-resonant sideband. CARM is fed back to the laser frequency with 20 kHz control 32loop bandwidth. Finally error signals for both l+= (lxly)/2 (PRC; power recycling cavity length) andl=lxly(MICH; Michelson degree of freedom) are derived from the carrier - resonant sideband beat at the pick-o (PO) port (see 2.2). In this work I will assume that all the cavities are already on resonance (locked). The process of lock-acquisition would ll a chapter on its own. See [ 53,54] instead. All quoted values are for the Hanford 4km interferometer (H1). 2.2 Sensing matrix All of the error signals used to control the LIGO interferometer are derived using a heterodyne scheme. Almost all length control signals are derived using the resonant sideband at 24 .5 MHz, with the exception being the REFL port on some interferom- eters (currently L1) - it uses the non-resonant sideband at 61 .2 MHz. The sensing matrix element used to read out a dierential arm (DARM or L) displacement, and hence to read out a Gravitational wave signal, is given by [ 47] the gain prefactor, ji() are Bessel functions of the rst kind, is the modulation depth, Pis the power into the interferometer, mis the resonant sideband modulation frequency, gcris the carrier amplitude recycling gain, tsbis the sideband transmission to the dark port, r/prime c=/(2F) is the derivative of the arm cavity reflectivity with respect to round trip phase, fcis the arm cavity pole, k is the light wave vector and L=dxdyis the dierential displacement. Numerical values for those parameters are tabulated in appendix A. There is an additional factor e hd(t) cosmtto convert the signal into a demodulated photo current. Here d(t) is the demodulation function (ideally a square wave), ethe electron charge, hPlanck's constant,the laser frequency and the photo diode quantum eciency. 33Here I will just list the other relevant sensing matrix elements, more details can be found in [ 51] and [ 47]. Besides the element 2.1used for DARM loop the elements used for the 3 other length control loops (CARM or L+, PRC orl+, MICH signicant is the element [ L+/squigglerightPOBI] (2.5), it could actually dominate thePOBI. In practice the high bandwidth (20 kHz unity gain frequency) CARM loop zeros the REFLIsignal by acting on the laser frequency. Since REFLI is also sensitive to l+through 2.6this high bandwidth loop (2.9) 34In practice however REFLQshows a large low frequency pollution that is thought to be due to the non-mode-matched component of the carrier eld. In fact this large signal limits the amount of power we can detect at the REFL port since it gets close to saturation in the photo detector. This has actually forced us to change the L+ readout on the Livingston interferometer to the non-resonant sideband. Since the non-resonant doesn't enter the recycling cavity it is not sensitive to motion of optics past the recycling mirror. In particular there cannot be any Qsignal. In Livingston we now use a diode tuned for the non-resonant sideband at 61 .2 MHz. The sensing matrix element is also given by equation 2.2, except that rsbandj1() refer to non- resonant sideband values. 2.3 Shot Noise The fundamental limit to detect the power at the dark port is the shot noise limit. Since the light at the dark port is dominated by the sidebands, eects from non- stationarity and demodulation have to power into the interferometer, d(t) is the wave form used for demodu- lation (typically a square wave since the local oscillator is squared up in the demod- ulation boards) and is the photo diode quantum eciency - see table A.3as well as section 2.2, paragraph 2 for the denition of the remaining symbols. The factor in the last bracket is required to convert the shot noise into Watts pkto be comparable with equation 2.1. The carrier to (both) sideband power ratio at the dark port was measured to be Pc/PSB0.09 using an Optical Spectrum Analyzer. It is also related to the contrast defect cd=P(beam splitter) carrier /P(AS port) carrier tsb0.77. Using equations 2.1,2.10 andP= 4 Watt displacement DARM This is good agreement with the experimentally measured shot noise (see gure 2.9). In particular this means that the overlap of sideband and carrier at the AS port is quite good - that overlap was assumed to be ideal in eq. 2.12. 2.4 The AS I signal A recurring problem during the commissioning of LIGO was a large signal in the uncontrolled orthogonal quadrant of a demodulated photo diode signal. Such a signal limits the amount of detectable power because a saturation of the RF electronics and the mixer has to be avoided. The problem exists both on REFLQ- where the solution was switching to the non-resonant sideband, see 2.2- and on the AS port. To get a signal in the Iquadrature of the dark port an eective sideband imbalance at the dark port gSBtMand arm cavity reflectivity imbalance rcis required [ 51]. tMis the transmissivity sideband the dark port. SASI=1 4gcrtMrcgsb (2.13) I say eective because contributions can come from higher order modes - I am using the arm cavities to dene the modal basis since the almost flat-flat recycling cavity supports all modes. In particular almost any angular misalignments will produce an 36ASI signal by beating rst order transverse modes. In fact even with all angular control loops closed we found a linear dependence of AS I on angular mirror mis- alignment, indicating that at least a part of the DC AS I signal is due to small osets in the angular control loops. The reflectivity imbalance rcfor the fundamental mode comes from an imbalance in the round trip loss in the arms. For l= 2 arcarises from arm cavity mode mismatch, both in beam width and beam curvature. The latter can be aected by changing the thermal lens in the ITMs (see 2.8). Another hint that a signicant contribution to the AS I signal is due to higher order spatial mode comes from a test with an output mode cleaner (OMC) in the AS detection path. The OMC eectively strips o higher order spatial modes and thus their contribution to the readout signal. It reduced the DC oset in AS I by a factor 9 and the RMS fluctuations in AS I by a factor 3. To quantify the size of the AS I signal is hard because it depends on so many factors (alignment osets and thermal lensing in ITM's). However a typical size of the DC signal in AS I before any tuning of the interferometer is SASI5\u00d7103Watt pkP 1 Watt. (2.14) This value can be tuned to zero by changing the dierential thermal lensing in the ITMs (see 2.8) and/or some alignment osets, aecting the l= 2 and/or l= 1 con- tributions to AS I respectively. Based on this and equation 2.13we can estimate the eective \"rc\u00d7gsb\" to be roughly 0.02 in the untuned case. Note that the measured contrast defect cd1\u00d7104(section 2.3) limits the arm reflectivity imbalance to rc= 2cd0.02. However this measurement was done in a thermally tuned state. I also want to point out that there is a natural mechanism that creates a sideband imbalance for higher order modes: the higher order mode pick up an additional phase shift from the arm. The arm cavity reflectivity of a sideband mode with mode FSR,L, RoC are the arm cavity transverse mode spacing, free spectral range, length and optics curvature. That translates into a sideband recycling gain given by gsb=TRM 1rMrcRRM(2.16) In particular the values for the sideband modes ( l= 0: funda- mental,l= 1: alignment mismatch and l= 2: mode mismatch) are given in table 2.1. In particular for the l= 2 bullseye mode the ratio between upper and lower sideband power becomes almost 2:1. Higher order mode SB recycling gain upper dierent spatial modes. foffis the frequency oset from the arm resonance. The phase shift induced by the arm causes a sideband power imbalance of almost 2:1 for the l= 2 mode. In practice the only way to avoid mixer saturations due to the large AS I signal was to implement feed-back that cancels out the AS I induced RF photo current on 38the diode. The installed system has a range of 10 Vpkthrough a coupling resistor of 1 kOhm, i.e. it can correct up to 10 mApkphoto current per diode. Allowing for a factor of 2 headroom to ride out seismic transients this means that we now need about 1 dark port photo diode per Watt into the interferometer. We are now running with 4 diodes. Without the AS I servo we would need about 10 times as many diodes since 1 mA pkof photo current and an average transimpedance of about 1 kOhm results in 1 V pk, which is about the slew rate limit of the MAX4107 op-amp at the photo detector output. Details about the AS I servo are given in [ 51], appendix H. 2.5 Oscillator phase noise As we increased the power into the interferometer to improve the high frequency sensitivity we started noticing a noise bump above about 1 kHz that was present in both the Livingston and the Hanford 4km interferometer, but with a somewhat dierent shape. The noise was as high as 4 \u00d71018m/ Hz at 1 kHz, which is 10 times above the design sensitivity. Eventually we were able to track this to phase noise of the 24.48 MHz RF oscillator that we used to modulate the input beam and as a local oscillator for the signal demodulation. At 1 kHz the our oscillator had about 6 \u00d7107rad/ Hz and the transfer function to displacement turned out to be a surprisingly high 7 \u00d71012m/rad (see gure 2-3). 2.5.1 Basic coupling The coupling of oscillator phase noise to displacement noise is closely related to the large AS I signal at the dark port. The basic coupling mechanism is simple - a jitter in the demodulation of the constant oset in AS I produces noise in AS Q. Fortunately there is a cancellation mechanism: since we are using the same oscillator to both modulate the light and demodulate the photo diode signal, any jitter on the oscillator should cancel out. There are 2 ways to circumvent this cancellation. First, any noise introduced after 39the split between the electro-optic modulator (EOM) path and the local oscillator (LO) path will couple directly into AS Q with the strength SASQ=SASI,DCN(f), (2.17) whereN(f) is the dierential phase noise between optical and LO path. This large sensitivity to the dierential phase noise prompted us to redesign the RF distribution system. We now amplify the signal before we split it and make sure we never dip below -1dBm LO level to avoid thermal noise. As oscillator we use a Wenzel Crystal oscillator with 10dBm output and and a phase noise specication of -140dBc/Hz at 100Hz,-155dBc/Hz at 1kHz and -162dBc/Hz at 10kHz. The thermal (Johnson) noise thus would degrade the LO signal at -168dBm/Hz (Johnson noise) - (-162dBc/Hz) + 5dB (amplier noise gure) = -1dBm. The is for the Mini-Circuits ERA-5 RF amplier that we use in the demodulation boards. The second way to avoid the cancellation is to introduce a relative phase shift between the 2 paths. A simple path length dierence is not large enough - the dierence between the 2 paths is about 5 meters resulting in a relative phase shift of only 1 \u00d7104radians at 1kHz. The optical cavities in the light path however can produce a signicant phase shift. Figure 2-3shows the measured transfer function from oscillator phase noise to displacement. As expected it rises as f2below about 2 kHz (see gure caption 2-3). But there is clearly a pole somewhere between 2.5 kHz and 3kHz (3dB point after correction for the cavity pole). Plus there are 2 resonances at 3.3 kHz and 5.5kHz corresponding to the spatial l= 2 sideband modes resonating in the arms. The obvious element that can introduce a phase shift in the optical path is the mode cleaner (MC). The sidebands are passed through the mode cleaner 2 free spectral ranges higher and lower. It has a pole frequency of 4.5 kHz (full width of 9 kHz). This is a bit too high for what is observed in the transfer function. Moreover an attempt to lter the LO with a 9 kHz wide crystal lter showed hardly any eect on the transfer function. Neither did detuning the mode cleaner and changing the 40102103101510141013101210111010109Oscillator Phase Noise coupling Frequency [Hz]coupling [meter/radian]Feb 2004 Sept 2005Figure 2-3: Measured transfer function oscillator phase noise displace- ment. The solid Feb 2004 trace was taken before any thermal tuning and with the old ITMX. The dashed Sept 2005 trace was taken after the ITMX was replaced and in a thermally tuned state. Below about 2kHz the traces rise as f2- one power of f is due to a zero at the cavity pole of 85Hz (barely visible), the other comes from the phase noise cancellation eect. In the Feb 2004 trace 2 resonances are visible at 3.3 kHz and 5.5kHz. They are due to (spatial) l= 2 sideband modes becoming resonant in the arms (see table 2.1). This was conrmed by slightly changing the main modulation frequency - the resonances move in opposite directions. 41modulation frequency at the same time to force a sideband imbalance. The only other cavity in the path is the recycling cavity, but taken alone its cavity pole is at 71 kHz. This, however, is not accurate when the arms are aligned and the double cavity resonance must be considered. 2.5.2 The double cavity as seen by the sideband When the arms are aligned and the interferometer is locked, the laser light sees an eective three-mirror cavity formed by RM, common ITM and common ETM, which is referred to as double cavity. For the carrier this double cavity has a pole frequency fDC(half the FWHM line width) of fDCfc1RRM|rc| 21 Hz (2.18) wherefc= 85 Hz is the arm cavity pole frequency, RRM= 0.973 is the recycling mirror power reflectivity and rcis the arm cavity amplitude reflectivity [ 52]. The pole frequency is so low because the double cavity round trip phase shift DC/ffor the carrier is dominated by the arm reflectivity change (equation 2.19, line 1,ARM/f andRM/fare arm cavity and recycling cavity round trip phase shifts). The (resonant) sideband on the other hand is close to anti-resonant in the arms. However it turns that DC/fisstilldominated by the arm reflectivity change, even though this term is reduced by r/prime2 ccompared to the carrier (equation 2.19, line the arms is even bigger when the sidebands are close to resonant in the arms, which is the case for higher order spatial modes ( l= 1,2) (see table 2.1 and equation 2.15). The resulting side band power recycling gain as a function of audio oset frequency for the sideband modes with l= 0,1,2 are shown in lower sideband for the l= 1,2 modes are sitting right 8000 6000 4000 2000 0 2000 4000 6000 8000100101 Audio Frequency Offset (Hz)Sideband Power Recycling GainDouble Cavity Figure 2-4: Fringe of the double cavity as seen by higher order sideband modes (l= 0,1,2).The fundamental mode sees a pole frequency of 12kHz and the upper and lower sideband are reasonably well balanced. For l= 1 and especially thel= 2 mode the sideband is sitting near the -3dB point and the lower sideband becomes completely anti-resonant at 3.3kHz oset. on the side of the fringe. The most dramatic phase shift is seen by the l= 2 mode of the lower sideband. Converting this fringe pattern into a transfer function can be a mess. All 3 modes 43l= 0,1,2 will contribute depending on how much carrier power of each mode is at the dark port. Here I will just focus on l= 2 since it will lead to the lowest pole frequency. Forl>0 the carrier can actually have non-zero components in both quadratures since the length servo cannot zero them. In the l= 2 case these 2 components come from an arm phase front curvature mismatch and from an arm beam radius mismatch. To work out the l= 2 contribution to the dark port noise of an oscillator phase modulation with modulation depth at an audio frequency f, I start with an expres- sion for the input beam with phase modulated sidebands: C0+S0/parenleftbig e+i(2fSBt+ cos 2 ft)+ei(2fSBt+ cos 2 ft)/parenrightbig (2.21) Since the modulation is assumed to be small I can use the approximation ei cos 2 ft= 1 +i 2e+i2ft+i 2ei2ft(2.22) When this eld is propagated through the mode cleaner and interferometer to the dark port each sideband term picks up the mode cleaner pole at 4 .59 kHz plus a factori tMg\u00b1fSB\u00b1faudio sb . Here I use the notation g\u00b1fSB\u00b1faudio sb to indicate the sideband recycling gain of the upper or lower ( \u00b1fSB) sideband with a positive or negative audio frequency oset ( \u00b1faudio). These are the quantities plotted in gure 2-4. Note that theg\u00b1fSB\u00b1faudio sb are dierent for each spatial mode l, but I assume that all modes see the same mode cleaner pole, i.e. I assume that the mode mismatching happens after the mode cleaner. I then assume that at the dark port the carrier is dominated by junk light that I 44leave as a free (complex) parameter C0. Thus the eld at the dark port cleaner transmission tMCaccounts for the mode cleaner pole. The photo current at the dark port is proportional to ||2, and it is demodulated with the local oscillator cos (2ft+ cos 2ft). This is where the cancellation eect mentioned above comes in. Carrying out this calculation, I nd that the phase noise transfer function is function. The (scaled) data from Feb 2004 is overlaid on this plot, but one should keep in mind that the model transfer function is only one from several possible coupling paths ( l= 0,1,2,...with 2 carrier quadratures each). With all that said I should also mention that the oscillator phase noise is always good for surprises: at one point we changed the mode cleaner length of the Livingston interferometer by 1 mm because we wanted to use an in-house oscillator with a slightly dierent frequency. Somehow this change resulted in a 10-fold (!) increase of the oscillator phase coupling. The best explanation I have is that this somehow changed the amount of light coupled into higher order modes ( l= 1,2) after the mode cleaner. The only way we were able to reduce the phase noise coupling was with the TCS system - see section 2.8.6. But even this only bought us a factor of a couple.

The scale is chosen arbitrary because the strength depends on the amount of carrier power in the l= 2 mode. The mode cleaner (MC) pole at 4.5 kHz has also been included - note that the population of thel= 2 mode has to happen after the MC. Also shown is the arbitrary scaled measurement from Feb 2004. 46we had to get a better signal generator - the one we were using had a phase noise performance of about 6 \u00d7107radians/ Hz. We installed an ultra-low noise crystal oscillator from Wenzel Associates, Inc. It has about 15 times less phase noise at 1kHz. 2.6 Oscillator amplitude noise The oscillator amplitude noise is related to the oscillator phase noise because the individual audio sidebands see the same transfer function through the interferometer. There are however 2 key dierences. There is no natural cancellation eect as for the phase noise. However the LO is squared up (saturated) before it is fed to the mixer, so amplitude fluctuations on the LO should not aect the demodulation. The basic coupling is given by SASQ=SASQ,DCN(f)/. Since AS Q is ser- voed to zero any coupling can only come from the remaining RMS value. This however is only true for the l= 0 mode and higher order modes will produce a signal similar to the phase noise coupling. 2.7 Noise Improvements below 100 Hz 2.7.1 The problem After eliminating a couple of noise sources that were aecting frequencies below 100 Hz, such as noisy coil drive electronics and coupling from the local damping loops, it became clear that there was signicant excess noise in the 40 Hz to 100 Hz band that was not explicable by linear noise prediction methods. Ultimately we were able to pin down this noise to two sources. One part was coupled in from from excess noise in the poorly controlled auxiliary loops that held the beam splitter (BS) and recycling mirror (RM) in place (MICH and PRC loops). The other part was due to saturation eects in the RF amplier at the output of the photo diodes. 47Finding these two noise sources was complicated by the fact that they had roughly the same amplitude and shape, and a clear improvement was only obvious after both problems were xed. 2.7.2 Auxiliary length control loops Noise in the l+(PRC) and l(MICH) control loops for the recycling mirror (RM) and the beam splitter (BS) can couple to the interferometer Ldisplacement signal. There are 2 dierent known - the dark port phase sensitivity to beam splitter motion compared to ETM motion is reduced by the arm cavity phase gain r/prime c= 2F/= 139. The l+coupling comes from sidebands beating against the residual carrier at the dark port that is due to an arm reflectivity imbalance [ 51]. As always there are 2 ways to go about ameliorating this problem: reduce the noise and reduce the coupling. 2.7.3 Coupling reduction: MICH and PRC correction Both MICH and PRC are limited by sensing noise in the band of interest (above 40 Hz), i.e. it is the control system that pushes the BS and RM. However we know both the noise and the coupling transfer function to DARM. Therefore we can send a scaled version of both the MICH and the PRC control signal to the ETMs to cancel out any linear coupling. This trick, referred to as MICH and PRC correction, was amazingly successful, especially for the MICH loop because its coupling is well dened and does not change. A coupling reduction of up to 37dB was achieved with the MICH correction. For the PRC correction we had to ne-tune the frequency dependence - for unknown reasons 48the coupling didn't quite follow the prediction (equation 2.25). After that we also got a reduction of about 20dB. In practice the strength of the PRC coupling proved to be highly modulated on a time scale between about 0.1 Hz and 10Hz, presumably because the arm reflectivity imbalance is aected by angular seismic disturbances. The displacement noise floor will thus be very bursty if it is limited by PRC noise. Increasing the angular control system bandwidth indeed reduced these coupling fluctuations. 2.7.4 Auxiliary loop noise reduction The goal of the auxiliary loops is to reduce the residual motion of BS and RM in the band of interest (above 40 Hz) as much as possible. Up to about 20 Hz there are a lot of environmental disturbances (seismic motion, coupling from angular degree of freedoms, suspension resonances such as bounce and roll mode) that jerk the optics around. Obviously we want as much gain as possible in that band in order to avoid saturation of the sensing electronics. However both auxiliary loops are shot noise limited at 100Hz at a level of a couple times 1015m/ Hz (MICH) and 1016m/ Hz (PRC). Especially for MICH this was a problem: up to the S3 science run we didn't use the MICH correction, i.e. we polluted the DARM signal with noise at 1015m/ Hz\u00d7 OLG MICH/139 above 100 Hz, where OLG MICH is the MICH open loop gain. Thus the MICH open loop gain had to be smaller than 1/100 at 100Hz. This meant that the only possible way to get good sensitivity above 100 Hz was to choose a very low unity gain frequency (UGF) for the MICH loop ( 11 Hz) and add a steep low-pass lter with a cut-o at about 50 Hz. As a consequence we didn't have the desired gain below 20 Hz and lots of up-converted noise dominated the auxiliary loop error signals up to almost 100Hz (see also [ 51]). This noise also showed up in all angular loops where it used up almost all of our actuation range for the ETMs and ITMs because of the steep dewhitening lters for those optics. The MICH correction's eective coupling reduction of -37dB allowed us to change the strategy completely. We now were able to run with a high UGF ( 70 Hz for 49Figure 2-6: Residual motion of the MICH (top) and the PRC (bottom) degree of freedom. The dashed blue curves correspond to the S3 conguration with a very low MICH UGF. The solid red curves show the improvements that were made possible by the implementation of the MICH correction which allowed running with a higher loop gain (see text). The bump at about 150 Hz in the lower red trace is due to gain peaking in the PRC loop. This was later resolved by rolling o the BS and RM dewhitening lters at 160 Hz which in turn allowed moving the PRC control signal roll o up to 1kHz eectively increasing the phase margin. (The dewhitening lters are analog low-pass lters in the actuation chain and deal with the DAC noise.) The black curves show the level of the dark noise (thermal noise in the photo diode tank circuit above 40 Hz, ADC noise below that. 50MICH, 110 Hz for PRC) which dramatically reduced the up-converted noise (see Figure 2-6). Additionally the reduced RMS signal at low frequency allowed us to detect all available power in the pick-o port - where it was possible we even used 2 pick-o ports. This lead to a further reduction of the shot noise in the auxiliary loops. 2.7.5 RF saturation at the photo diode output amplier Since the light at the anti-symmetric port is dominated by the sidebands, the by far biggest RF signal in the photo current is the sideband beat signal at twice the main modulation frequency of 24 .48 MHz (2signal). To mitigate this, the photo diode tank circuit not only has a resonance at 24 .48 MHz, but is also equipped with an about 40 dB deep notch at 48 .96 MHz. After that the signal is amplied and shipped to the demodulation board in the electronics rack. Unfortunately it turned out that, despite the notch at 48 .96 MHz, the 2 RF signal at this photo diode output amplier was too big and was running into the slew rate limit, causing the up-converted noise that was visible in the DARM loop. The problem was mitigated by adding a notch, consisting of a coil and a trim-cap, in the feed-back path of the amplier. This changed the total 2 notch depth from about 40 dB to about 60 dB. After this x, the RF signal at this photo diode output amplier was no longer dominated by the 2 signal, but rather by higher order modulation products for which we had no notch in the circuit. With this x in place and the auxiliary loops under high bandwidth control, the noise in the 40 Hz to 100 Hz band dropped by almost an order of magnitude. However there is still some noise left in this band that so far could not be successfully explained. 512.8 The Thermal Compensation System 2.8.1 The problem The original design for the radius of curvature of the LIGO optics assumed a certain level of thermal lensing based on the estimated absorption and an anticipated power into the IFO of about 6 Watts. The absorption in the ITM's and ETM's is expected to be due to HR coating absorption (about 1 ppm [ 71]) and substrate absorption (4-5 ppm/cm). As a result the LIGO interferometers had a slightly wrong radius of curvature in the ITM's and ETM's during the initial phase of commissioning (up to S2, after which we started increasing the input power). This is a tiny eect for the stable arm cavities. The arms dene the spatial mode of the carrier, which therefore is only slightly aected. The biggest thermal lens though is generated in the ITM substrate. It mostly aects the sideband because the sideband only resonates in the recycling cavity which was designed to be marginally stable. Consequently the sideband mode size is critically dependent on the thermal lens. In its cold state the recycling cavity is even unstable which gives rise to ring- shaped resonating modes and a signicant reduction in power buildup due to mode mismatching and spill-over. We indeed only achieved a sideband recycling gain of Gsb= 13 at that time, while theoretically one expects about Gsb=/parenleftbiggtRM 1rRMrM/parenrightbigg2 = 30 (2.26) (see appendix A). When the input power was increased on H1, the sideband recycling gain increased dramatically, as expected. However, we reached a maximum of Gsb= 26.5 at only 1.8 Watt into the MC ( 1.2 Watt into the IFO). When going to higher powers Gsb came down again and the sideband mode was shrinking in size. This was a clear indication that the absorption in at least one optic of the recycling cavity was too high, though guring out which one turned out to be non-trivial since reopening 52the vacuum is costly. Using spot size measurements at several IFO ports and in dierent heating states [ 70] nally allowed us to conclude that ITMX had the biggest absorption, 34 \u00b14 mWatt per Watt of power into the MC. ITMY had about 2.6 times less absorption , but that's still more than expected. From these measurements it is impossible to know whether the absorption is in the bulk or on the coating. Since the power hitting the HR surface is 140 times bigger than what travels through the ITM, and since it seems impossible to accidentally pollute the interior of the mirror during the installation, it seemed likely that this excess absorption is on the surface. We have about 2275 Watt of arm power per Watt into the MC. The inferred coating absorptions therefore are 15 \u00b11.8 ITMX and 5.6\u00b10.7 for ITMY; the specication was less than 1 ppm. (If it were due to bulk absorption the numbers would be 210 ppm/cm for ITMX and 78 ppm/cm for ITMY; the specication was less than 5 ppm/cm.) 2.8.2 The hardware A possible way to address this problem was shown by R. Lawrence in his thesis [ 67]. He studied the feasibility of a thermal compensation system for Advanced LIGO. Based on this work an upgrade Thermal Compensation System for initial LIGO was developed [ 68,69]. Two Thermal Compensation systems were installed for each interferometer, one for each ITM. Each system consists of a 10 Watt CO 2Laser (10.6\u00b5mwavelength) that illuminates a switchable mask. Using a telescope with a magnication of 26.5 this pattern is then projected on to the HR surface of an ITM - the 10 .6\u00b5mlight is almost completely absorbed on the optic. We chose to illuminate the HR surface because of existing geometrical constraints - we would have preferred the AR surface because we expected it to be less sensitive to heating laser intensity noise. As mask we either use a ring (or annulus) pattern to compensate for too much heat deposited in the center by the main Laser (\"cooling\"), or a mask with a hole in the center to add more heat at the center of the optic (\"heating\") (see Figures 2-7and2-8). For practical reasons the central mask is actually installed in the Fourier plane of the 53Figure 2-7: A schematic of the Thermal Compensation System (TCS) that was installed on both ITM's on all 3 interferometers. It consists of a 10 .6\u00b5mCO2 Laser, a set of masks and a projection system that produces an image of the mask on the optic. See text for more details. projection system. A Bessel mask further downstream clips the higher order maxima of the Airy diraction pattern, leaving only the central lobe of the Airy disk. It is a quite good approximation to the main laser Gaussian beam prole. A polarizer on a rotation stage was used to adjust the power. Figure 2-8: Thermal images of the projected heating pattern taken with an infrared camera in a test setup. From left to right the images were taken with an annulus mask, a central mask and no mask (illumination beam). The annulus mask image clearly shows the 4 spokes supporting the central part of the mask. 542.8.3 Time dependence of the thermal lens correction There are two relevant time constants for the formation of the thermal lens. First there is the time to form the lens itself, given roughly by therm =C(heated volume) (conductive heat and the density (see Ap- pendix Afor numerical values for SiO 2). Then there is the time required to get the temperature across the whole optic into a stationary state, assuming only radiative cooling stat=Cm LOS (radiative cooling)=Cm LOS (4ABT3 0)3 hours (2.28) A= 0.13 m2is the surface area of the optic and mLOS= 10.5 kg the mass of optic. In order to get a more detailed understanding of the time dependence of the thermal lens induced by the new TCS system I numerically solved the heat diusion equation dT dt= C/triangleT (2.29) using a simple nite dierence 2-dimensional MATLAB code assuming cylindrical symmetry. Here Tis the temperature eld (deviation from ambient temperature T0).

Pheaton the HR surface was modeled as a Gaussian beam with radius w= 4 cm (same as main interferometer beam on ITM) for the central heating case and as Gaussian beam with radius w= 12 cm, clipped at r<4 cm andr>12.5cm, for the annulus heating case. Pheat= 0 on all other surfaces. Figure 2-9shows snapshots of the temperature prole for the annulus heating case at dierent times. The CO 2Laser was turned on at t= 0. The heat slowly propagates 55toward the center of the optic. This is unfortunate since there it forms a convex lens that counteracts the intended concave one. Figure 2-9: Temperature prole of a cross-section through the ITM at dierent times after the heat was turned on. The axis are radius (r) and depth (z). Initially the temperature prole forms a clean annulus pattern, but later on the heat propagates toward the center of the optic where it forms a lens with opposite sign and thus reduces the total eciency.

Eects due to the the Poisson ratio are neglected since dn/dT is already the dominant term. To convert this optical thickness into a lens power F, it is tted with a quadratic function dopt(r) =1 2Fr2+ const (2.32) taking into account only data points inside the beam radius of the main laser beam. The result is plotted in Figure 2-10. The lens power Fpeaks at 15min at a level of 9\u00d7105m1and then drops by 45% with a time constant of 4.3 hours. This long time constant posed a practical problem. In order to keep the interfer- ometer at its desired operating point with a sideband recycling gain close to 30 it was now necessary to continuously adjust the compensation power for the rst couple of hours of each lock. We thus needed a servo that can do this automatically.

After peaking at 15min the lens power drops by 45% with a 1/e time constant of 4.3 hours. 57is described in the next section, for now I will assume that we have such a servo. In order to compare the model described in this paragraph to the real behavior of the interferometer I used the numerical code to compute the impulse response of the lens power Fto a short burst of compensation power. (The Fourier transform of this impulse response is relevant for the servo system and is shown in Figure 2-12.) I then inverted this impulse response to get the required compensation power in order to keep a constant lens power F. This compensation power is plotted in Figure 2-11, together with the actuator output for a 12 hour lock during which the servo kept the interferometer at the optimal operation point. The agreement speaks for itself. 0 2 4 6 8 10 1200.511.5Required TCS Power hoursITMX Annulus Heating (Watt) H1:TCSITMX_PD2 Model Figure 2-11: Annulus compensation power required to keep the thermal lens constant.

The blue dots are photo diode read-backs of the applied compensation power over a 12 hour lock, during which the servo system kept the interferometer at the optimal operations point. 582.8.4 Servo system As mentioned a TCS servo system was key to keeping the interferometer at the right operation point when the annulus heating mode was used. The critical part was getting a usable error signal for the common heating. Since common heating strongly aects the sideband mode size in the recycling cavity, and therefore the overlap between carrier and sideband in the recycling cavity, installing a radial RF mode matching wavefront sensor or bullseye detector in the interferometer BS pick-o port provided a clean error signal. The bullseye detector was originally developed by the University of Florida and intended to improve the input beam mode matching [ 74]. It consists of a round central quadrature with a diameter of 2 mm and 3 outer quadratures with the same sensitive area placed in a tight circle around the central quadrature. The diode was tuned for the resonant sideband frequency (24 .48 MHz) and an RF notch at 49 .96 MHz was added. Since the bullseye mode (12r2/w2) exp ( r2/w2) has a node at r=w/ 2, and since the gap between inner and outer quadrants is at r= 1 mm, the beam radius on the bullseye detector has to be w= 1.41 mm. Furthermore in order to be sensitive to the wavefront curvature dierence between carrier and sideband in the recycling cavity it has to be placed at the same Gouy phase as the recycling cavity. Both of these requirements can easily be fullled suciently by one focusing lens and placing the bullseye detector before the focus where the beam radius is w= 1.41 mm. On H1, experimentally it was immediately clear that the AS I signal was sensitive to the dierential TCS heating. AS I is known to be sensitive to a lot of dierent alignment parameters too (see section 2.4), but a non-zero AS I signal hurts only because of the danger of RF saturation in the RF electronics. Therefore, servoing ASI to zero by actuating the TCS systems dierentially was the right thing to do - especially since this also reduced the Oscillator Phase noise coupling (see 2.8.6 and 2.5). Once the error signals were available the servo loop was easy to close (Figure 2-13). The servo code was rst implemented as Unix stand-alone with a sampling 59Figure 2-12: Transfer function \"actuation power to thermal lens power\" for the TCS system in both annulus and central heating mode. Both functions have been scaled to unity gain at 4 mHz, about the unity gain frequency of the servo loop. Central heating is 9.6 times more ecient, but the smaller central mask also blocks 3.9 times more power, leaving a factor 2.5 higher actuation range for the central mode. The functions were calculated as Fourier transforms of the numerically calculated impulse responses. The Nyquist frequency was 0.5 Hz, which is why both magnitude and phase show an unphysical behavior above 0.1 Hz. 60frequency of 1 Hz and was later replaced by Epics code running at 5 Hz sampling rate, even though the eective update rate of the rotational stage is not that fast. The actuation function is given by Figure 2-12. Aiming for a simple 1 /fopen loop shape the control lters were simple integrators (pole at f= 0 Hz) with a thermal pole compensation zero at f= 1/(10 min). The common servo loop was generally run with a unity gain frequency of about 1 /(5 min), the dierential servo loop at about 3 times lower gain. CTRL_GAIN_X/Y+ +CTRL_OFFSET_X/YINPUT_MATRIXD_INCHANTCS 1 TCS Filter 2-13: Flow chart of the TCS servo system. The common error signal (CINCHAN) is the bullseye error signal. The dierential error signal (D INCHAN) is AS I. X/Y OUTCHAN are connected to the rotation stages that control the TCS power. The diamonds labeled with X/Y Logic contained code that automatically switched from annulus to central mode and adjusted the gain when a negative control signal was applied. However they were never used because a mask flip produces an intensity transient that is visible as a glitch in the displacement signal. 2.8.5 Noise couplings The TCS system can convert intensity noise on the CO 2laser into displacement noise. There are 2 mechanisms. Radiation pressure (Equation 2.33) is conceptually simpler, but not dominant at the sweet spot around f= 150Hz. /angbracketleft/trianglez/angbracketright=P/c mLOS(2f)2RIN = 3.6\u00d71019m/parenleftbigg150 Hz f/parenrightbigg2/parenleftbiggP 1 mWatt/parenrightbigg RIN (2.33) RIN is the relative intensity noise on the CO 2laser,Pits DC power hitting the optic, cthe speed of light and mLOSthe mass of the optic. 61The dominant coupling is due to the same eect as the thermal lensing: expan- sion of the optic and change of the index of refraction ninduced by temperature fluctuations. There are three somewhat distinct mechanisms that do contribute: Expansion of the optic: This mostly changes the cavity length. The change of the optical path length outside the cavity is small for this eect. Change of index of refraction: This changes the optical path length of the light outside the cavity. Bending of the whole optic: This eect was rst pointed out to me by Phil Willems [ 57] after I tried in vain to understand the magnitude of the annulus transfer function. The deposited heat eectively curls the optic like a bimetallic strip. The center of mass does not move so the the area read out by the arm cavity beam will move even if there is no overlap with the heating beam. Therefore, this naturally becomes the dominant term for annulus heating. The eect does not exist for an innitely large optic. Expansion of the optic From equation 2.29 one can see that the penetration depth dof fluctuations at fre- quencyfis given by d=/radicalbigg 2fC= 30\u00b5m/parenleftbigg150 Hz f/parenrightbigg1 2 (2.34) which is smaller than the scale on which the heating pattern p(x,y) changes. There- fore the heat flow is essentially one-dimensional along the optical axis. The energy density in this surface layer is given by E(x,y) =C/integraltext dzT. Since dzT (2.35) 62The temperature fluctuations in this surface layer have 2 eects. The surface layer expands by /trianglez1= (1 +)/integraldisplay dzT. (2.36) The factor (1 + ) arises because only the surface layer is heated, i.e. no lateral expansion is permitted. This induces a lateral stress T=ESTwhich in turn produces an additional expansion of /epsilon1||=T/ESalong the optical axis. is the Poisson ratio and ESis the Young's modulus. Since only a thin layer with a mass much smaller than the rest of the optic is expanding all of the expansion /trianglez1goes into changing the arm cavity length. Change of index of refraction Additionally the optical thickness of the ITM is increased by by r/prime c= 2Fbecause it only aects the light outside the arm cavity. Fis the nesse of the arm cavity. Also the eect has the opposite sign compared the the expansion eect. Putting together equations 2.35,2.36and2.37we get for the displacement induced by the heated surface layer /trianglez(x,y) =/bracketleftbigg (1 +)/parenleftBig 1 2F(n1)/parenrightBig 2Fdn dT/bracketrightbigg1 2ifCp(x,y) (2.38) Finally, to get the average displacement seen by the interferometer one has to average /trianglez(x,y) over the main laser beam. Since the readout photo diode ultimately detects power the beam intensity is the right weighting factor, i.e. /angbracketleft/trianglez/angbracketright=/integraltext dxdyI (x,y)/trianglez(x,y)/integraltext dxdyI beam prole with beam 63radiusw= 4 cm. In central heating mode the CO 2laser heating pattern p(x,y) has the same prole as the main laser and we get /angbracketleftp/angbracketright=P/(w2), whereP=/integraltext dxdyp (x,y) is the total heating power. In annulus mode there is an additional factor of about 1/30 due to the reduced overlap of p(x,y) andI(x,y), which is more than observed experimentally, see gure 2-14. Bending of the optic A bimetallic strip with extreme thickness ratio d/lessmuchhand dimensions ( h+d)/lessmuch width /lessmuchlength will bend along its largest dimension with a radius of curvature R given by (see for instance [ 76,57]) 1 R=6d/epsilon1 h2(2.40) with /epsilon1being the mist strain. In fact, for a small, unconstrained patch with width /lessmuchRandlength /lessmuchRthe same results holds for both the length and the width dimension. Corrections due to geometric constraints will only arise when the surface area is not heated uniformly (e.g. heat only in the center). Nevertheless I will rst naively apply this result to our case of an optic with a thin heated surface layer and worry about corrections afterward: 1 R(r)=6 h2/integraldisplay dzT(z,r) (2.41) Based on that we can estimate the displacement prole of the front surface the second term guarantees that the center of mass does not move. Again one has to average over the readout beam. I do this numerically an get /angbracketleft/trianglez3/angbracketright=6 h2P shape ,Roptic). beam radius willum= 11 cm, inner mask radiusrinner= 4 cm) the numerical factor is Cann num0.055. As mentioned this calculation is only correct for a strip that has no additional geometric constraint, i.e. there is a correction if we want to bend a plate into a sphere element. However in annulus mode heat is only deposited at the edge and the correction should be small. In appendix DI estimate that the correction to equation 2.43 for central heating is 1 1 +lnr2 r1, (2.44) withr2=Ropticthe radius of the optic and r1=wthe radius of the heating beam. Including that correction the numerical factor for central heating is Ccen num0.12. In both cases the sign of this eect is the same as for the expansion eect. Total thermo-optical eect For the magnitude of the thermo-optical intensity noise coupling in central heating mode we therefore get /angbracketleft/trianglez/angbracketright=P RIN. (2.45) Herew= 4 cm is the beam radius and h= 10 cm is the optic thickness. The thermo- optical eect thus dominates over the radiation pressure eect everywhere above 0 .6 Hz. For the annulus mode calculated number is /angbracketleft/trianglez/angbracketright= 1.4\u00d71017m/parenleftbigg150 Hz f/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggP 1 mWatt/parenrightbigg RIN. (2.46) It is dominated by the bending term. To verify this prediction the heating beam was modulated with an acoustooptic modulator and the transfer function to displacement was measured with the locked 651021031018101710161015 Hzm/mWattTransfer Function CO2 RIN > Displacement Data central mode Model central mode Data annulus mode Model annulus mode Radiation pressureFigure 2-14: TCS noise coupling Comparison of modeled and measured \" CO 2 intensity noise to displacement\" coupling.

The transfer functions in both cen- tral mode and annulus agree with the model - almost too well for the approximations made. Finally the relative intensity noise (RIN) of the installed 10 Watt CO 2laser system was measured (Figure 2-15). Initially the RIN had several bad peaks that turned out to arise from reflections from the masks and the polarizer on the rotation stage back into the laser. Designing a solid mount for the rotation stage and carefully dumping all reflections xed this problem. The RIN of the current system is around 2 \u00d7106 in the critical 100 Hz - 500 Hz band, but only 1 \u00d7105at 2 kHz. With an active Figure 2-15: Relative Intensity Noise of theCO 2lasers used in the TCS system. The measurement was repeated at dierent power levels (AOM voltage settings). Data points that vary systematically between the 5 traces are sensing noise limited (e.g. 60 Hz and harmonics, data above 20 kHz and below 60 Hz). The peak at 2 kHz however is real but fortunately outside the band around 150 Hz where we are most sensitive. Between 100 Hz and 500 Hz we have a RIN of about 2 \u00d7106. intensity stabilization servo for the CO 2lasers it should be possible to get the RIN as low as 5 \u00d7107at all relevant frequencies, but so far this was not necessary. Combining the RIN measurement and the measured transfer function we can estimate the contribution of the TCS intensity noise to the Ldisplacement noise. For the S5 conguration this is shown in gure 2-16 (black dashed line). It was 67estimated assuming 30 mWatt of heating power per ITM (the actual value can vary because the required heat changes during a lock). The noise level is now about 30 times below the design sensitivity. During S4 (i.e. before the ITMX was replaced) however the noise contribution was about 6 times higher since we needed about 50 times more power but only won a factor of 8 due to the lower noise coupling in annulus mode. 2.8.6 Oscillator Phase noise reduction The coupling mechanism of oscillator phase noise depends on the amount of both carrier and sideband light in the bullseye mode ( l= 2). Indeed we noticed that applying heat dierentially to the ITMs (e.g. annulus mode on ITMX and central mode on ITMY) aects the phase noise coupling. We were able to reduce the coupling by about a factor of 4 using this tuning. After we replaced ITMX with a lower absorption optic the the coupling was at this lower level even without dierential TCS tuning, so during S5 no dierential control loop was running. 2.8.7 Optics replacement after S4 Since we wanted to further increase the circulating power after the fourth science run (S4), it was ultimately decided to open the vacuum system and replace the high absorption ITMX (see section 2.7.1) with a spare optic. During the same vent ITMY, which also showed an elevated absorption level, was wiped. This incursion proved to be quite successful - afterward the measured absorption levels were consistent with the specications for both ITMs. As a consequence we then had to run with the TCS system in central mode. 68102103102010191018101710161015 Frequency [Hz]Displacement [m/ \u00d6Hz]H1: Mpc, Predicted: Total SRDFigure 2-16: H1 Noise Budget: The displacement spectrum is shown in solid black.

See text for more information. 702.9 Summary of known noise sources Figure 2-16shows one of the best displacement spectra from H1 (solid black) together with estimates for all known noise sources. The inspiral range - the sky-averaged distance out to which a neutron star inspiral can be seen with an SNR of at least 8 - is 14.5 Mpc. The sum of all identied noise sources predicts an inspiral range of 17 Mpc. In particular those noise sources are MICH: This cross-talk estimate is based on the MICH CTRL channel and the transfer function to displacement includes an estimate for the MICH correction eciency, see section 2.7.2. Without that correction the MICH noise would be about 37dB higher and dominate the displacement sensitivity. PRC: This cross-talk estimate is based on the PRC CTRL channel and the transfer function to displacement includes an estimate for the PRC correction eciency, see section 2.7.2. Oscillator Phase Noise: The estimate is based on the phase noise speci- cation of the Wenzel crystal oscillator and the measured transfer function to displacement, see section 2.5. Optical Levers: Noise due to angle to length cross-talk from the angular drive of the optical levers, see also [ 51], section 4.1.5. Wave Front Sensors (WFS): Noise due to angle to length cross-talk from the angular drive of the wave front sensing system, see also [ 51], section 4.1.5. OSEM: Noise due to local damping loops. Seismic: Seismic ground motion propagated through a model of the seismic isolation stack and the optics suspension. See [ 58,51]. Drive electronics: Combined noise of the ETM, ITM and BS drive electronics. See [51], section 4.1.4 and [ 56] for updates to the coil driver. 71Suspension Thermal Noise: Thermal noise of the single steel wire loop suspension. It has been analyzed in detail in [ 63]. The shown trace is for a wire loss angle of = 1.0\u00d7103. Recent measurements by S. Penn and G. Harry at MIT suggest that the intrinsic wire loss angle of the steel wire is as low as= 1.7\u00d7104. However in situ violin mode Q measurements suggest an eective loss angle closer to = 3\u00d7103, with the worst inferred loss angle being= 5.6\u00d7103. The clamping of the wire to the suspension cage is suspected to be responsible for this discrepancy. In the region around 100 Hz the suspension thermal noise scales as 1 2. Internal Thermal Noise: Thermal motion of the test mass itself. There is still some uncertainty in the knowledge of the coating loss angle. The shown trace is for a coating loss angle of 2 \u00d7104. For more details see [ 62]. Other relevant references: [ 59,60,61,51]. Shot Noise: Photon shot noise at the AS port. The trace was calculated using the measured DC photo current. See also section 2.3. Note that the input power was recently increased by about 30%. Dark Noise: Sensing noise when no light is present at the AS port. Above roughly 60 Hz this is due to AS I servo drive noise, which dominates the thermal noise in the photo diode tank circuit. Below that it is ADC noise. Intensity Noise: This estimate is based on a RIN measurement and a RIN to displacement transfer function measurement. For more details see [ 51], section 4.2.1. Frequency Noise: Also based on an out-of-loop REFL I sensing noise (shot noise) measurement and a REFL I to displacement transfer function measure- ment. For more details see [ 51], section 4.2.2. TCS: Thermal Compensation System intensity noise coupling, see section 2.8.5. 72Total: Incoherent (RMS) sum of all known noise sources. It explains the displacement noise everywhere except in the 60 Hz to 100 Hz band. This is also the band that shows dependence on seismic activity below 10 Hz. At this point it looks like up-conversion in the drive electronics could be responsible for this. SRD: This is the design sensitivity curve from the Science Requirement Docu- ment [ 39]. 2.10 Limitations of the existing hardware At the time of writing all three LIGO interferometers have reached or surpassed their design sensitivity. However, while this is a key milestone for the LIGO project, the current interferometers still have a potential for improvements. From gures 2-16 and2-17 it is clear that the interferometers are limited by shot noise everywhere above (and including) the sweet spot at 150Hz. Therefore the interferometer sensitivity can be improved by increasing the circulating power further. To be able to do that however, an upgraded laser is required. The currently installed lasers from Lightwave with a nominal output power of 10 Watts are getting close to the end of their lives, and the available laser power is maxed out on both the H1 and L1 interferometer. Based on the experience with the installed thermal compensation system (section 2.8) and the optics absorption levels after the ITMX replacement, it seems plausible that the interferometers can run with at least 5 times more input power without suering too much from thermal aberrations. However, the sensing photo diodes and electronics are already running out of headroom at the current power level, mostly due to a too big AS I signal (section 2.4). Thus one would have to scale the number of photo diodes at the dark port from currently four to on the order of twenty, which just is very impractical. A more attractive way around this problem is to install and commission an output mode cleaner [ 50]. It can remove all the junk light that is responsible for the AS I signal before it hits the photo diode. But because an output mode cleaner introduces 73a sensitivity to beam jitter, it has to be installed seismically isolated and in-vacuum. Tentative plans to both upgrade the laser and install an in-vacuum output mode cleaner after the one year long S5 science run are in place [ 50]. 74Chapter 3 Searching for an anisotropic background of gravitational waves The LIGO Scientic Collaboration has analyzed the data from the rst three science runs for an isotropic stochastic background of gravitational waves [ 90,91]. It is possible though that the dominant source of stochastic gravitational waves in the LIGO frequency band comes from an ensemble of astrophysical sources (e.g. [ 95, 9]). If such an ensemble turns out to be dominated by its strongest members then the assumption of isotropy is no longer valid. Instead one should look for anisotropies in the stochastic gravitational wave background. In this chapter I introduce an analysis that, based on the cross-correlation of the data streams from two spatially separated gravitational wave interferometers, allows to resolve such anisotropies. Any search for stochastic gravitational waves by denition assumes two things about the targeted source(s): The duty cycle is signicant (1), i.e. it is not a transient source. This is a key assumption since the signature of transient sources is overwhelmed by the integration over the whole run. The wave form is unknown. This is not a requirement - after all we are free to ignore that knowledge. But if the wave form is known, a matched template search (e.g. the LIGO Pulsar search [ 87,88]) would be more sensitive. 75Of course one still has to know, or assume, the frequency content of the signal. This information is specied by the signal strain power spectrum H(f) (see appendix C.1 for a denition). Under the assumption that this signal strain power spectrum H(f) is known, the analysis presented in the chapter is optimal. First though I will introduce the properties of a stochastic background of gravita- tional waves and discuss the existing indirect and direct experimental limits on such a background. 3.1 Cosmological source A cosmological stochastic background of gravitational waves is in many ways similar to the Cosmic Microwave Background from the early universe (CMB, [ 5,6]), which is a background of electromagnetic waves. As with the CMB it is useful to characterize the gravitational background by normalizing the energy density gwper logarithmic frequencyfby the energy density required to close the universe, c. gw(f) =1 cdgw dlnf(3.1) The critical energy density cfollows from the Friedman equation and is c=3c2H2 0 8G1.7\u00d7108h2ergs cm3. (3.2) HereH0=h\u00d7100 km sec1Mpc1is the Hubble constant (today). gw(f) is related to the strain power spectrum Sgw(f) visible to an interferometer through gw(f) =102 3H2 See appendix derivation. The main dierence relative to the CMB is that a gravitational wave background decouples much earlier in the history of the universe. Depending on the model this could happen during the inflationary epoch, i.e. around the grand unication scale 76(1016GeV) or during the Planck era ( c5/planckover2pi1G11019GeV), when Quantum Gravity still was important. The predictions on the spectral shape and amplitude of gw(f) also vary a lot depending on the model. A good summary is given in [ 94]. 3.1.1 Existing bounds on h2gw(f) Nucleosynthesis: The successful prediction of the cosmic abundances of the lightest elements (3He,4He and7Li) by the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis can be used to set a constrain on the gravitational wave energy density during Nucleosynthesis [ 94]. This can be understood as follows: Just before the neutrino freeze-out at a tem- peratureTF1.2\u00d71010K or about 1 MeV the neutron to proton is given by nn/np= exp( Q/T F), whereQ=mnmp= 1.3MeV. After the neutrinos freeze out some of the remaining neutrons decay, but most of them end up in4He. Hence the4He abundance is exponentially sensitive to temperature TF. The neutrino freeze-out temperature TFon the other hand is dened by the reaction rate penbeing equal to the Hubble expansion rate H=/radicalbig 8G/ 3. The reaction rate is roughly penG2 FT5(really only appropriate for T > Q ). GF= 1.1664\u00d7105GeV2is the Fermi coupling constant describing the weak inter- action. The total energy density during this period can be expressed as =2 30k4 B /planckover2pi13c3gT4=g 2aT4. (3.4) Herea= and gis the eective number of species (i.e. relativistic particles) during the epoch of Nucleosynthesis. This shows that TFg1 6, i.e. the4He abundance is sensitive to the eective number of species during Nucleosynthesis. The of freedom of the i-th particle (spin, color,...) andTiis its temperature. For gravitons we have gw=aT4 gw, dening the partial temperature Tgw, even though they are not in thermal equilibrium. The photons are in thermal equilibrium, T=T, and we have =aT4. Thus the contribution from gravitational waves to the number of species gis given by g= 2gw (3.6) Also note that often limits on gare given as number of extra neutrinos N. The conversion is g= 7/4N. The measured abundance of4He restricts gwto be at most of the same magnitude as the photon energy density during the epoch of Nucleosynthesis [ 94]. Bothgw andscale asT4(1 +z)4, but the later annihilation of electron-positron pairs increases the photon energy density by a factor (11 /4)4/33.8. Finally, the transition from a radiation to a matter dominated universe happened at z4\u00d7104h2, resulting in h2=h2 c2.5\u00d7105(3.7) and therefore an upper limit for the gravitational wave energy density gwof h2/integraldisplay d(lnf)gw(f) =h2gw=h2gw c<6\u00d7106. (3.8) This limit spans all frequencies, but it only applies to gravitational waves that were already present during Nucleosynthesis at z109. CMB: The measurement of the large angle fluctuations in the CMB by COBE [ 5] and WMAP [ 6] can be used to derive an upper limit for frequencies that are inside the horizon today ( f >3\u00d71018Hz), but were still outside the horizon during the time of last scattering ( f Pulsars are extremely precise clocks - for some of them the spin frequency is know with a relative precision of a couple \u00d71016. They can thus be used to measure time of flight variations due to gravitational waves crossing the line of sight. The longest accessible wavelength is determined by the distance to the pulsar and the sensitivity to shorter wavelength drops rapidly since the signal is averaged out over many wavelengths [ 86]. h2gw(f)<4.8\u00d7109/parenleftbiggf f/parenrightbigg2 , f >f = 4.4\u00d7109Hz. (3.10) Tracking: This is analogous to the radio pulsar timing. The upper limit based on measurements with the Cassini Spacecraft [ 85] is h2gw(f)<0.025,atf1.2\u00d7106Hz. (3.11) Direct measurement: The frequency band above roughly 10 Hz is accessible to terrestrial experiments. The rst experimental upper limits came from resonant bar detectors for a narrow band around 1 kHz. They were rst operating on their own and later in pairs, allowing for a correlation analysis [ 79,80,81,82,83]. The rst upper limit using an interferometer was published in 1994 [ 84]. In 2005 the LIGO collaboration published its best upper limit so far, achieving h2gw(f)<4.4\u00d7104 [91]. Table 3.1lists the published upper limits that were achieved. 3.2 Astrophysical sources It is possible that the dominant source of stochastic gravitational waves in the LIGO frequency band comes from an ensemble of astrophysical sources (e.g. [ 95,9]). In this case the Nucleosynthesis bound - the tightest existing bound in the LIGO frequency band - is not applicable. Furthermore, if such an ensemble turns out to be dominated by its strongest members then the assumption of isotropy is no longer valid. Instead one should look for anisotropies in the stochastic gravitational wave background. This was addressed in Ref. [ 96,97], but they characterized the anisotropies in terms 79Experimental Limits Experiment Limit on Frequency Reference h2gw(f) Room Temperature<3000 f0= 985 \u00b180 3.1: Published direct upper limits on gw(f) achieved by terrestrial detectors of spherical harmonics, and focused on getting optimal estimates for each spherical harmonic. If the stochastic gravitational wave background is indeed dominated by individual sources one can get a better signal-to-noise ratio by obtaining optimal lters for small patches of the sky (see section 3.3). This is the motivation for the radiometer analysis. While the real strength of the radiometer analysis is its sensitivity to sources with an unknown wave form it is still useful to see how good it can do for known sources. As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, the key requirement for the radiometer analysis to be applicable is that the targeted source has a signicant duty cycle. This excludes individual collisions of compact objects and stellar explosions. The only known astrophysical sources that fulll this criterion are rotating neutron stars (pulsars). Of particular interest are accreting neutron stars, for two reasons: The power radiated in gravitational waves is proportional to the sixth power of the spin frequency, and the fastest spinning known pulsars were all spun up by accreting matter. In order to radiate gravitational waves the pulsar has to have a non-vanishing 80quadrupole momentum and matter falling on to the surface seems to be a nat- ural mechanism to produce such a deviation from spherical symmetry. Binary star systems with ongoing accretion on to a compact object are known as X-ray binaries. Two types are distinguished, Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXB) and High Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXB). I want to focus on the Low-Mass X-ray Binaries because as far as I can tell they are the strongest predicted continuous source of gravitational waves that is known to exist. 3.2.1 Accretion driven pulsars: Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXB) Whether a neutron star in a close binary system is accreting mass depends on the ratio of the mass of the neutron star to that of the companion. Stable mass transfer in such a system only occurs when the companion lls its Roche lobe and has a smaller mass than the neutron star. Systems with such a low-mass companion are called Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs). Accretion in systems with a high mass companion has to be driven by the com- panion's stellar wind. These systems are referred to as High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) and typically have lower accretion rates. Accreting neutron stars with a high mass accretion rate will spin up until some mechanism can radiate away the angular momentum of the matter falling in. The two possible candidates are electromagnetic dipole radiation and gravitational quadrupole radiation [ 9,10]. The radiated power Pis given by 6c3\u00b50B2 poleR6sin2()4(3.12) for magnetic dipole radiation and Pgw=32G 5c5M2R4/epsilon126(3.13) gravitational radiation. The corresponding radiational torque is T=P/.Bpole 81is the magnetic eld at the pole, RandMthe radius and mass of the neutron star, the angle between magnetic and rotational axis, the spin angular frequency and /epsilon12=QijQij/(MR2)2withQij=/integraltext d3x(xixjijr2/3) the quadrupole moment of the neutron star. Clearly if the accretion rate is large enough and the magnetic eld weak enough gravitational radiation will eventually dominate. There is observational evidence that the spin frequencies of LMXBs with high accretion rate ( M>1011Myr1) and low magnetic ( B/lessmuch1011G) cluster between about 300 Hz and 730Hz. No neutron star spinning faster than 730Hz has been found so far [ 11]. The low magnetic elds Bsuggest that these systems are not balanced by electromagnetic radiation and thus balancing by gravitational radiation is a possibility and would require a quadrupole moment of moment of inertia is I1038kg m2. The X-ray luminosity of a LMXB is given by the potential energy of the accreting mass M LX=MGM R(3.15) and exerts a torque of about T=M GMR. (3.16) If gravitational radiation is indeed the relevant angular momentum balancing mech- anism the gravitational wave luminosity is tied whereKepler =/radicalbig GM/R3andis frequency. A typical value for / Kepler is 0.2. It turns out that the brightest X-ray source in the sky (short of the sun), Sco-X1, is actually a LMXB and thus a prime candidate as a gravitational wave source. Its magnetic eld is indeed weak ( 107G, [12]) but unfortunately so far 82its spin frequency is not known, even though quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs) are observed in the X-ray [ 15]. The two observed QPOs are relatively coherent ( Q100) and have frequencies of about 700 Hz and 1000 Hz, but their frequency increases with the accretion rate. There are speculations that the dierence between the 2 frequencies might be the pulsar spin frequency, but a recent study seems to to exclude this theory [ 16]. Table 3.2summarizes known relevant parameters of Sco-X1 at earth 2.5\u00d7107erg/sec/cm2 Magnetic eld near NS 1\u00d7107Gauss Orbital period 68023.84 \u00b10.08 sec Orbital velocity 40\u00b15 km/sec Eccentricity 0 (References: [ 13], [14], [12]) Interestingly Sco-X1 dominates the X-ray flux due to all LMXB's at the earth. To estimate this we can tie the X-ray luminosity density to the stellar mass density by LX,Gal(z)1040erg/s\u00d7MGal(z)/(1011M) and estimate the stellar mass density as a function of zbyMGal(z)5\u00d7108MMpc3\u00d7(1 +z)1,[17]. Thus, for the standard cosmological parameters ( H0= 72 km s1Mpc1, m= 0.3, 83We can also estimate the flux from the Virgo cluster FLMXB ,Virgo3000 Galaxies \u00d71040 erg sec Galaxy\u00d71 4(15 Mpc)2 1\u00d7109erg sec cm2(3.19) Since the apparent diameter of the Virgo cluster is about 15 degree it covers about 1/230 of the whole sky. Together with the numbers from equations 3.18and3.19this implies that X-ray flux due to LMXB - and therefore also the GW flux due to LMXB - is about 30 times stronger than average when looking at the Virgo cluster. Values for the expected gravitational wave flux can be obtained through equation 3.17. The strain power spectrum H(f) is connected to the gravitational wave flux through FGW=/integraldisplay dfFf,GW = 4c3 G/integraldisplay to H(f) is at twice the pulsar spin frequency. The band- width is limited by the orbital frequency broadening of the binary star df=fGWvorbital c<0.2 Hz (3.22) where I used fGW<2\u00d7730 Hz. 730 Hz is the highest spin frequency ever observed on a neutron star. If we want to choose a narrower bandwidth we will have to correct for this orbital frequency shift. The earth's orbital motion has an eect of the same order of magnitude ( df/f 1\u00d7104, but longer period), while the earth's rotation only produces df/f1.5\u00d7 106. These are all eects that can be corrected for in a specialized analysis looking only at Sco-X1. This is not done in the radiometer code because the code is optimized for broadband signals. 84Finally the intrinsic frequency stability of the accreting pulsar can be estimated by assuming that the torque from the accreting matter is not The Radiometer 3.3.1 Introduction In this section I present a directional method to search for an anisotropic gravita- tional wave background that implements a gravitational wave radiometer [ 93]. The algorithm has been implemented in MATLAB and was used to analyze the LIGO S4 science run. A summary of the relevant formulas can also be found in appendix C. 3.3.2 Search for an isotropic background The data from the rst three LIGO science runs was analyzed with a method described in detail in Ref. [ 98,90,91,92]. The data streams from a pair of detectors were cross- correlated with a cross-correlation kernel Qchosen to be optimal for an assumed strain power spectrum Sgw(f)=Sgw(|f|) and angular distribution P()=1 (isotropic distribution). Specically, with S1(f) andS2(f) representing the Fourier transforms of the strain outputs of two detectors, this cross-correlation is computed in frequency domain whereis a normalization factor, P1andP2are the strain noise power spectra of the two detectors, Sgwis the strain power spectrum of the stochastic background being 85searched for (see ref [ 91,90]) and the factor isotakes into account the cancellation of an isotropic omni-directional signal ( P() = 1) at higher frequencies due to the detector separation. isois called the overlap reduction function [ 99] and is given by (the normalization is such that iso(f=0)=1 for aligned where /arrowrighttophalfx=/arrowrighttophalfx2/arrowrighttophalfx1is the detector separation vector, is the unit vector specifying the sky position and FA i() =eA ab()1 2(Xa iXb iYa iYb i) (3.27) is the response of detector i to a zero frequency, unit amplitude, A= + or \u00d7polarized gravitational wave. eA ab() polarization tensor for polarization Aand Xa iand Ya iare unit vectors pointing in the directions of the detector arms (see [ 98] for details). The optimal lter Qis derived assuming that the intrinsic detector noise is Gaus- sian and stationary over the measurement time, uncorrelated between detectors, and uncorrelated with and much greater in power than the stochastic gravitational wave signal. Under these assumptions the expected variance, 2 Y, of the cross-correlation is dominated by the noise in the individual detectors, whereas the expected value of the cross-correlation Ydepends on the stochastic A,B) =/integraltext A(f)B(f)P1(f)P2(f)dfand Tis the duration of the measurement. In order to address the long-term non-stationarity of the detector noise the data set from a given interferometer pair is divided into equal-length intervals, and the cross-correlation Yand theoretical Yare calculated for each interval, yielding a set {YI,YI}of such values, with Ilabeling the intervals. The interval length can be 86chosen such that the detector noise is relatively stationary over one interval. In Ref. [91,90] the interval length was chosen to be 60 sec. The cross-correlation values are combined to produce a nal cross-correlation estimator, Yopt, that maximizes 2 opt=/summationtext I2 YI. (3.29) In practice the intervals are typically overlapping by 50% to avoid the eective loss of half the data due to the required windowing (Hanning). Thus equation 3.29 has to be modied slightly to take the correlation of neighboring segments into account (see [ 101]). Since the LIGO Hanford and Livingston sites are separated by 3000km the overlap reduction function for this pair has already dropped below 5% around each interfer- ometer's sweet spot of 150 Hz, where the GW wavelength, 2000 km, is no longer large compared to the site separation. One unfortunate drawback of this analysis thus is the limited use it makes of the individual interferometer's most sensitive frequency region. Moreover, if the dominant gravitational wave background would be of astro- physical origin the assumption of an isotropic background is not well justied. If, for example, the signal is dominated by a few strong sources, a directed search can achieve a better signal-to-noise ratio. 3.3.3 Directional search: a gravitational wave radiometer A natural generalization of the method described above can be achieved by nding the optimal lter for an angular power distribution P(). 2/summationdisplay Aei2f\u00b7/arrowrighttophalfx cFA 1()FA 2() (3.31) 87andH(f) is the strain power spectrum of an unpolarized point source, summed over both polarizations (see appendix C.1). Note that also becomes sidereal time dependent both through /arrowrighttophalfxandFA i(). Eq.3.30was used in Ref. [ 96] as a starting point to derive optimal lters for each spherical harmonic. However if one wants to optimize the method for well localized astrophysical sources it seems more natural to use a P() that only covers a localized patch in the sky. Furthermore, for most reasonable choices of H(f), the maximal resolution of this method will be no better than several tens of square degrees, so that most astrophysical sources would not be resolved. It makes sense therefore to optimize the method for true point sources, i.e. P() =2(,/prime). With this choice of P(), the optimal lter Q/primefor the sky as in the isotropic case, the long-term non-stationarity of the detector noise can be addressed by processing the data on a segment by segment basis. However /prime changes continuously with sidereal time. By setting /primeto its mid-segment value one can get rid of the 1st order error, but a 2nd order error remains and is of the order dthe detector separation. For Tseg= 60 sec, f= 2 kHz and d= 3000 km this error is less than 1%. Thus, for suciently short segment length, the integration over sidereal time for each /primeagain reduces to the optimal combination of the set {YI,YI}/primegiven by Eq. 883.29. The only dierence to that the optimal lter Q/prime is for each interval Iand each sky direction /prime. 3.3.4 Numerical aspects To implement this method one thus has to calculate Y/prime=T/integraldisplay df /primeH P1P2S1S2, sky direction /primeand each segment I. This can be done very eciently by realizing that splits into a DC part, 1 /2/summationtext AFA 1()FA 2(), and a phasor, exp(i2f\u00b7/arrowrighttophalfx/c). For both integrals the DC part can be taken out of the fre- quency integration, leaving all the directional information of the integrands in the phasor: sky directions /prime, the computational load per segment is reduced from 2 Nintegrations to one fast Fourier transform, one integral and N readouts of the cross-correlation Y/primeat the time shifts =/prime\u00b7/arrowrighttophalfx/c. Since the fast Fourier transform of S1S2H/(P1P2) is sampled at fsample = 2fNyquist it is necessary to interpolate to get the cross-correlation Y/primeat the time shift . How- ever, by choosing a high enough Nyquist frequency and zero-padding the unused bandwidth this interpolation error can be kept small while the overall computational eciency is still maintained. 893.3.5 Comparison to the isotropic case It is interesting to look at the potential signal-to-noise ratio improvement of this directional method compared to the isotropic method if indeed all correlated signal would come from one point /prime, i.e. /angbracketleftS 1S2/angbracketright=/primeH. The ratio between the two signal-to-noise ratios works summing over side- real time. This ratio is bounded between 1 and 1, i.e. the directional search not only performs better in this case but, for a point source at an unfortunate position, the isotropic search can even yield negative or zero correlation. It is also possible to recover the isotropic result as an integral over the sky. The denitions of isoand(Eq. 3.26 is dened by 2 ,/prime=4 T/integraldisplay df/primeH2 P1P2(3.39) However there is dierence between this ,/primeand the the covariance 2 ,/prime=/angbracketleftYY/prime/angbracketright of the 2 sky directions and /prime.

In practice though an uneven coverage of the sidereal day due to down- time and time-of-day dependent sensitivity will break this symmetry, leaving only an antipodal symmetry. For the initial LIGO Hanford 4km - Livingston 4km pair (H1-L1), both at design sensitivity, and a flat source power spectrum ( H(f) independent of frequency), this 91works out to HH1L1 sens 1.5\u00d71050Hz1/parenleftbigg1 yr T/parenrightbigg1 2 (3.42) with a 35% variation depending on the declination.

To take into account the non-uniform day coverage, real lock segment start and stop times were used. To get a shorter turn- around time during testing, the code was only run on 1 .7 days of integrated simulated data. The signal power spectrum was assumed to be flat, H(f) = const. The algorithm was run on a 360 \u00d7181 point grid covering the whole sky. While this clearly over-samples the intrinsic resolution - for the H(f) = const case the antenna lobe has a FWHM area of 50 100 deg2, depending on declination - it produces nicer pictures, as shown in Figure 3-2. ForH(f) =f3the antenna lobe FWHM is even about bigger. For gure 3-3a stochastic signal was added: coherent noise with a flat power spectrumH(f) and a sidereal time dependent time shift and amplitude modulation appropriate for a true unpolarized point source. This simulated signal was produced and calibrated piecewise in frequency domain and multiplied by a phasor exp ( i2f i) to encode the time shift iappropriate for the source location, the current sidereal time and detector i. Both polarizations were 92Figure 3-2: An example map SNR = Yopt/optfor simu- lated Gaussian noise (see text). The visible structure - fringes with opposite tilt on the northern and southern hemisphere as required by the antipodal symmetry of the antenna lobe - is due to the antenna lobe. Figure 3-3: A point source with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 14 was injected at the position of the Virgo galaxy cluster (12 .5h, 12.7). It is nicely recovered. This map also shows the typical structure of the antenna lobe including negative correlation in regions adjacent to the main peak. 93produced independent of each other and chosen to have the same power spectral density, as required for an unpolarized source. Then, for each detector, the signal was transformed back to time domain using a fast Fourier transform and multiplied by the DC antenna acceptance FA i(t), resulting in periodic segments of 32 second duration. These segments were then spliced together using a sin window and 50% overlap, thus preserving the power spectral density. The injected source in gure 3-3has a signal-to-noise ratio of 14 and is clearly recovered. This gure also shows the typical shape of the radiometer antenna lobe which is given by Eq. 3.40. In particular it shows that areas adjacent to the main lobe get a negative correlation. This means that a particularly unfortunate set of sources could in principle cancel a lot of the signal. 3.4.2 Bias factor In [100] is was shown that using the same data for PSD estimation and cross- correlation results in a bias (underestimate) for both point estimate and standard deviation estimate. This is why the PSD is now estimated using adjacent data seg- ments. This eliminates the bias in the point estimate, but a bias in the standard deviation estimate remains. It can be calculated by estimate trueN1 N(3.45) whereNis eective number of samples used for It is given by N= 2\u00d79 11\u00d72947.5 (3.46) The factors are: 2 9/11 due to use of Welch's method; in each 60 sec segment there are 29, 50% overlapping, 4sec long sub-segments that are used for Welch's method. 94All reported standard deviations are thus corrected (multiplied) with the factor bias factor =N N1= 1.022 (3.47) 3.4.3 Hardware injections Hardware injections are useful because they unambiguously test the whole detection and analysis system. They are expensive though in terms of using up valuable inter- ferometer time. For that reason no directional broadband stochastic injections were made. However both short isotropic stochastic and pulsar injections were made and can be used to verify the radiometer search code. The isotropic stochastic injections are broadband coherent noise injections de- signed to mimic an isotropic primordial stochastic gravitational wave background - except that they are stronger. They were used to verify the isotropic search code (see e.g. [ 90,91]). The isotropic result is related to the radiometer output through equation 3.38. Rather than rerunning on the stochastic injections, I veried that equation 3.38 is fullled, which has to be the case even without injections. The pulsar injections have the advantage that they were on during roughly half of the S4 run, but they are narrow-band and have a well-dened polarization. In particular a pulsar wave form is given hi(t) the angle between the neutron star's spin direction and the wave propagation direction,fthe spin frequency, h0the wave amplitude and EA i(t,) the projection operator of polarization Aon to detector i- it diers from FA i(t) in that the + and 95\u00d7polarization are dened relative to the neutron star's spin axis. ( FA i(t) are dened relative to the earth's pole.) They are related by E+ i E\u00d7 i = cos 2sin 2 sin 2cos 2 F+ i F\u00d7 i (3.50) The radiometer code assumes that any correlation is due to an unpolarized source and weights the dierent observation times accordingly. Therefore the radiometer will estimate the strength of has to be taken over all observation times ti. Note that both h+and h\u00d7are peak amplitudes, while H(f)dfis the RMS power due to the pulsar that is estimated by the radiometer. Equation 3.51 assumes that the interferometer noise stays constant, an assumption that is certainly broken by diurnal variations in the noise floor. This will introduce some systematics. The parameters of the 3 strongest inject pulsars - named Pulsar3, Pulsar4 and Pulsar8 - are given in table injected pulsars Table summarizing the parameters of the fake pulsars injected into Hard- ware during the S4 run.():Hdf is the equivalent unpolarized RMS power that the radiometer should detect for the pulsar. It was calculated using equation 3.51, the actual pulsar injection times and a calibration correction amounting to 20%. Table 3.4summarizes the result of the pulsar hardware injection. Pulsar3 and Pulsar8 are consistent within the error bar. The high-SNR Pulsar4 is - 109.125 marks injected 3-5: Hardware Injection: Pulsar4, 1401.875 Hz - 1402.375 marks injected pulsar.

The eective power Hdf is given for both the location of the maximum and the true source location. The last line is the injected strength, see table 3.3. The resulting underestimate for the high-SNR Pulsar4 is probably due to a systematic bias in the power spectrum estimate when a strong signal is present [ 100]. The pulsar location is found accurately. derestimated by 5%. Possible contributers to this factor are a systematic bias in the power spectrum estimate when a strong signal is present (see [ 100]), the bias arising from the diurnal sensitivity variations (see above) and a frequency bin acceptance 98correction for the narrow-band pulsar signal that is due to the Hanning windowing. 3.4.4 Timing Transient The rst maps that I produced for the whole S4 run had an anomaly (low SNR) at the poles. The poles are special because they do not require a sidereal time dependent time shift. Thus I calculated the cross-correlation time series without sidereal time dependent time shift ( = 1) andH(f) =1 Hz2 f3. The result was a 5correlation between H1 and L1 - the cross-correlation as a function of time shift and the square root of the integrated number of segments is shown in timing transient: Cross-correlation time series for a unity overlap reduction function ( = 1) andH(f) =1 Hz2 f3as a function of the square root of the integrated number of segments. For the whole S4 run there is a 5correlation between H1 and L1. This correlation is due to a periodic timing transient that was present in both interferometers (see gure 3-8). This correlation was found to be due to an exactly 1-sec periodic signal in both interferometers (gure 3-8), which was caused by cross-talk from the GPS RAMP signal. The GPS RAMP signal is synchronized with the GPS receivers and consists of a 10 msec saw-tooth signal that starts at every full GPS second and lasts for 1 99msec (see gure 3-8). This ramp was used as an o-line monitor of the ADC card timing and thus was hooked up to an LSC ADC card, which resulted in a non-zero cross-talk. 0 50 100 1501012 msecuVolt PentekH1:DARM_ERR (1437280 averages) 4 6 8 10 12 141012 msecuVolt PentekH1:DARM_ERR (1437280 averages) 0 50 100 15042024 msecuVolt PentekL1:DARM_ERR (1447904 averages) 0 2 4 6 12 1442024 msecuVolt PentekL1:DARM_ERR (1447904 averages) Figure 3-8: Periodic timing transient in DARM ERR calibrated in \u00b5Volt at the ADC (Pentek card) for H1 (left) and L1 (right) shown with a span of 200 msec (top) and 14 msec (bottom) in blue. The x-axis is the oset from a full GPS second. About 1.4 million seconds of DARM ERR data was averaged to get this trace. Also shown in red is the GPS RAMP signal that was used as a timing monitor. It was identied as cause for the periodic timing transient in DARM ERR. The H1 trace shows an additional feature at 6 msec since its GPS RAMP signal was routed through a whitening board. There are two ways to remove this signal from the data stream. On can notch every full Hz frequency bin. To reduce the amount of lost data this requires longer time segments which in turn makes the handling of the non-stationarity harder and increases the memory usage of the code. While these are both solvable problems, I chose the second way mostly because it is more elegant. This second way is to subtract the transient in time domain. This has the ad- vantage that only a very narrow band (1 /runtime 1\u00d7106Hz) is removed while the rest of the analysis is completely unaected. The wave form for subtraction from the raw (uncalibrated) data was recovered by averaging the data from the whole run together to produce a typical second. Additionally - since this typical second only showed signicant features in the rst 80 msec - the transient subtraction template was set to zero (with a smooth transition) after 120 msec (gure 3-9). 1000 0.02 0.04 0.06 (sec)DARM_ERR 3-9: H1 timing transient in raw DARM ERR counts that was used in the analysis to remove the eect. The rst 80 msec are identical to the trace shown in gure 3-8A, after that it smoothly transitions to zero. No similar subtraction was made to L1 to avoid introducing accidental correlation. This subtraction was only done for H1 since adding repetitive data to both de- tectors can introduce articial correlation. This subtraction eciently eliminated the observed correlation. Furthermore all hardware injection results (section 3.4.3) were obtained with this subtraction. For the S5 run the GPS RAMP signal was replaced with a two-tone signal at 900 Hz and 901 Hz. The beat between the two is now used to monitor the timing. 3.4.5 Data cuts and post processing The LIGO Detector Characterization working group has put together a list of all known types of data degradation, including the times during which they occurred [102]. Some of these so called Data Quality Flags indicate problems that should be excluded a priori form the analysis. Table 3.5summarizes the data quality flags that were excluded a priori. Most of them are obviously required, the rest were used since the amount of data lost is minimal and it was easier to stay on the safe side. Additionally a minimum segment duration of 182 seconds was required (60 seconds of usable data + 60 seconds on each side for a power spectrum estimate + 1 second at 101the beginning and end for cutting ltering transients). This cut is already included in the numbers of table 3.5.

The individual flags do overlap partially, so the total amount of lost data is smaller than the sum of all individual flags. One post-processing cut was required to deal with the detector non-stationarity. To avoid a bias in the cross-correlation statistics the 2 adjacent segments are used for the power spectral density (PSD) estimate [ 100]. Therefore the analysis becomes vulnerable to large, short transients that happen in one instrument in the middle segment - such transients cause a signicant underestimate of the PSD and thus of the theoretical standard deviation for this segment. This leads to a contamination of 102the nal estimate. To eliminate this problem the standard deviation is estimated for both the middle segment and the 2 adjacent segments. The two estimates are then required to agree within 20%/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglelogmiddle adjacent/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle<log 1.2 (3.52) The analysis is fairly insensitive to the threshold - the only signicant contamination comes from gigantic outliers that are cut by any reasonable threshold. The chosen threshold of 20% eliminates less than 6 % of the data. 0 1 2 3 4 5100101102103104 ratioH=1/f3, Reject 5.6% 0 1 2 3 4 5100101102103104 Reject 2.5% Figure 3-10: Histogram of the ratio middle/adjacent for the nal S4 analysis (see chapter 4).

Blue is before the cut, red after the cut (eq. 3.52). 103104Chapter 4 Results from S4 The LIGO S4 science run consisted of one month of coincidence data taking with all three LIGO interferometers (22 Feb 2005 noon to 23 Mar 2005 midnight CST). During that time all three interferometers where roughly a factor of 2 away from design sensitivity over almost the whole frequency band. Also, the Livingston interferometer was equipped with a Hydraulic External Pre-Isolation (HEPI) system, allowing it to stay locked during day time. This made S4 the rst LIGO science run with all-day coverage at both sites. Since the radiometer analysis requires two spatially separated sites I only used data from the two 4 km interferometers (H1 in Hanford and L1 in Livingston). For these two interferometers, about 20 days of coincident data was collected, corresponding to a duty cycle of 69%. 4.1 Broadband results As mentioned at the beginning of chapter 3the only real restriction of a stochastic search is a signicant source duty cycle, with the caveat that the method is only optimal if the waveform is not known. Consequently the main purpose of doing a directional stochastic search is to set a limit on possibly unknown sources. Nevertheless the shape of source power spectrum H(f) has to be chosen a priori. Arguably the simplest possible assumption is to 105choose some power law for H(f). I chose two dierent power laws for H(f): Constant gw(f):H(f) =1 Hz2 f3This emphasizes low frequencies and is useful when interpreting the result in a cosmological framework, since it corresponds to a scale-invariant primordial perturbation spectrum. Constant strain power: H(f) = 1 Hz1This simply emphasizes the frequencies for which the interferometer strain sensitivity is highest. The results are reported as point estimate Yand corresponding standard deviation for each pixel (see section 3.3.3). The point estimate Yhas to be interpreted as best t assuming a source spectral shape H(f), i.e. the best estimate for the true source spectrum is HY(f) =YH(f). 4.1.1 S4 Result: Histogram (left) and map (right) of to-noise ratio (SNR) for H(f) =1 Hz2 f3. The green curve is a maximum likelihood Gaussian t to the data. The red solid line is an ideal Gaussian, the two dash-dotted red lines are the 1- bands around the ideal Gaussian for Ne= 100. Figure 4-1shows a histogram and a map of the bias-corrected SNR =Y . It was produced by weighting all data points on the map with the corresponding sky area in square degrees. But neighboring points are correlated, eectively reducing the number of independent points Ne. That is why the histogram can look non-Gaussian 106even though the data is still consistent with (correlated) Gaussian noise. Indeed the histogram in gure 4-1features a slight bump around SNR=2, but is still consistent withNe= 100 - the red dash-dotted lines indicate the 1- bands around the red ideal Gaussian for Ne= 100. The histogram is clearly consistent with them. Additionally the SNR distribution also passes a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for Ne= 100 (= 0.1). So far though I do not know of any precise way to calculate Ne. However I applied 2 heuristic methods that produced roughly the same answer: Spherical harmonics decomposition of the SNR map. The resulting power vs l graph shows structure up to roughly l= 9 and falls of steeply above that - the l= 9 point corresponds to one twentieth of the maximal power. The eective number of independent points then is Ne(l+ 1)2= 100. FWHM area of a strong injected source, which is latitude dependent but of the order of 800 deg2. To ll the sky we need about Ne50 of those patches. This is probably even an overestimate because the correlation angle is bigger than the FWHM angle. Nevertheless, I used the higher Ne= 100 for this discussion. Figure 4-1suggests that the data is consistent with no signal. Thus I calculated a Bayesian 90% upper limit for each sky direction. The prior was assumed to be flat between zero and innity (even though a single interferometer power spectrum sets a tighter limit than any previous experiments). Additionally I marginalized over the calibration uncertainty of 8 % for H1 and 5% for L1 using a Gaussian probability distribution. The resulting upper limit map is shown in gure 4-2. The upper limits on the strain power spectrum H(f) vary between roughly 1 .2\u00d71048Hz1/parenleftBig 100 Hz f/parenrightBig3 and 1.2\u00d71047Hz1/parenleftBig 100 Hz f/parenrightBig3 depending on the exact position in the sky. For completeness gure 4-3also shows the point estimate and theoretical standard deviation maps. 107Figure 4-2: S4 Final Result: Map of the Bayesian upper limit forH(f) =1 Hz2 f3.

Structure in the spherical harmonics power spectrum goes up to l= 19, thusNewas estimated to be Ne(l+ 1)2= 400. Alternatively the FWHM area of a strong injection covers about 100 deg2which also leads to Ne400. The dash-dotted red lines in the histogram (gure 4-4) correspond to the expected 1 deviations from the ideal Gaussian for Ne= 400. The histogram is thus consistent with (correlated) 108Gaussian noise, indicating that there is no signal present. The SNR distribution also passes a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for Ne= 400 (= 0.1). 5 0 area S4 Result: Histogram (left) and map (right) of the bias corrected signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) for H(f) = 1 Hz1. The green curve is a maximum likelihood Gaussian t to the data. The red solid line is an ideal Gaussian, the two dash-dotted red lines are the 1 bands around the ideal Gaussian for Ne= 400. Again I calculated a Bayesian 90% upper limit for each sky direction, including the marginalization over the calibration uncertainty. The prior was assumed to be flat between 0 and . The resulting upper limit map is shown in gure 4-5. The upper limits on the strain power spectrum H(f) vary between roughly 8 .5\u00d71049Hz1and 6.1\u00d71048Hz1depending on the exact position in the sky. Finally gure 4-6also shows the point estimate and theoretical standard deviation maps. 4.1.3 Interpretation The maps presented in gures 4-2and4-5show the rst directional upper limits on a stochastic gravitational wave background ever obtained. They are consistent with no gravitational wave background being present. The most important aspect of this result is that it sets a limit on unexpected nearby sources, which means the interpretation ends with the limit on the strain power spectrum. On the other hand one can interpret the result in terms of potential sources. As an example I look at the gravitational luminosity of all LMXBs within the Virgo galaxy 109Figure 4-5: S4 Final Result: Map of the 90 % condence level Bayesian upper limit forH(f) = 1 Hz1.The upper limit varies between roughly 8 .5\u00d71049Hz1and 6.1\u00d71048Hz1depending on the exact position in the sky. Figure 4-6: S4 Result: Map of the point estimate Y(left) and the theoretical standard deviation forH(f) = 1 Hz1. cluster. They have an integrated X-ray luminosity of about 1 \u00d7109erg/sec/cm2(see equation 3.19). For simplicity I assume that they produce a flat strain power spectrum H(f) over a bandwidth f. Then the strength of this strain power spectrum about H(f) =2G c31 fKeplerffFX1055Hz1/parenleftbigg100 Hz f/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg100 out of reach. 1104.2 Limits on isotropic background Using formula 3.38it is possible to recover the point estimate and standard deviation for the isotropic case (see also appendix C.4). From that the 90% Bayesian upper limit can be calculated. I additionally marginalize over the DC calibration uncertainty. Setting the Hubble constant to 72km sec Mpc, the 90% upper limit I can set on gw(f) is 1.20\u00d7104. Alternatively, assuming a flat strain power spectrum, the limit is 5.13\u00d7105/parenleftbigf 100Hz/parenrightbig3. Table 4.1summarizes that =const and theSgw(f) =const case. The rst two lines show point estimate and standard deviation that are used to calculate the 90% Bayesian upper limits. Those upper limits are also marginalized over the calibration uncertainty. 4.2.1 Interpretation The limit on an isotropic stochastic background of gravitational waves that can be set with the S4 data is roughly one order of magnitude lower than the published LIGO S3 limit [ 91], which already was by far the best experimental limit in the terrestrial accessible frequency band (see section 3.1.1). In fact LIGO has the prospect of improving on the Nucleosynthesis bound of gw<1.2\u00d7105in the current and future science runs. 1114.3 Narrow-band results targeted on Sco-X1 The gravitational wave flux from all LMXB is expected to be dominated by the closest one, Sco-X1 (see section 3.2.1). Unfortunately its spin frequency is not really known. I thus want to set an upper limit for each frequency bin on the RMS strain coming from the direction of Sco-X1 (see table 3.2). The bin width I chose was df= 0.25 Hz, which is the same bin width that was used for the broadband analysis. To choose a narrower band, corrections for the orbital phase of the companion star would have to be made (see equation 3.22). To avoid contamination from the injected pulsars, the 2 frequency bins next to a pulsar frequency were excluded. Multiples of 60 Hz were also excluded. The lowest frequency was 50 Hz, the highest was 1799.75 Hz. The left side of gure 4-7shows a histogram of the remaining 6965 0 .25 Hz wide frequency bins. It is consistent with a Gaussian distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with N= 6965 and = 0.1). 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 40100200300400500600 SNRNScoX1, Histogram Result for Sco-X1: For each 0.25 Hz wide frequency bin a pint estimate and standard deviation is calculated. The resulting SNR is histogrammed on the left side. There are no outliers. The resulting 90% condence Bayesian upper limit as a function of frequency - marginalized over the calibration uncertainty, is plotted on the right (red). Also shown is the standard deviation (blue). A 90% Bayesian upper limit for each frequency bin was calculated based on the point estimate and standard deviation, including a marginalization over the calibra- tion uncertainty (H1: 8%; L1: 5%). The gure 4-7is a plot of this 90% limit (red trace). Above about 200 Hz (shot noise regime above cavity pole) the 112typical upper limit rises linearly with frequency and is given by h(90%) RMS8.4\u00d71024/parenleftbiggf 500 Hz/parenrightbigg f>200 Hz (4.2) The standard deviation is also shown in blue. 4.3.1 Interpretation The radiometer analysis is clearly not the optimal way to go after a presumably periodic source like Sco-X1. Nevertheless it can set an upper limit with a minimal set of assumptions on the source. The frequency resolution of 0 .25 Hz presented here is close to the minimal bandwidth that is required if one does not correct for orbital parameters of the source. The upper limit (eq. 4.2) can directly be compared to the expected strain based on the X-ray luminosity (eq. 3.21): h(90%) RMS hLX RMS440/parenleftbiggf 500 Hz/parenrightbigg3 2 (4.3) Here f is the gravitational wave frequency, i.e. twice the (unknown) spin frequency of Sco-X1. So we really don't expect to see anything yet. Furthermore the upper limit for the strain scales as/parenleftbigd f T/parenrightbig1/4, withdfthe bin width and T the total run duration. So even if one integrates for a year, corrects for all orbital frequency shifts and reduces dfto the intrinsic limit of 8 \u00d7105Hz (eq. 3.23) the upper limit on the strain improves only by a factor of 16. Clearly the way to go is to further improve the interferometer sensitivity - since S4 the strain sensitivity has already been increased by 2 to 3, depending on the frequency. 113114Conclusion At the time of writing all three LIGO interferometers have reached or surpassed their design sensitivity and are now acquiring science data. To reach this goal, it was critical to increase the power in the interferometer to more than 200 Watts incident on the beam splitter. This required the commissioning of both a thermal compensation system (TCS) and shot noise limited sensing electronics capable of detecting all the light. Additionally, a series of unexpected noise sources had to be mitigated. All of these steps are discussed in chapter 2. While reaching the design sensitivity is a key milestone for the LIGO project, the current interferometers still have the potential for at least a factor of 2 of improvement in strain sensitivity [ 50]. In a second part I introduce a radiometer analysis that uses the cross-correlation of the data streams from two spatially separated gravitational wave interferometers to spatially resolve anisotropies in a stochastic gravitational wave background. The analysis is optimized for identifying point sources of stochastic gravitational radiation. Data from the fourth LIGO science run (S4) was analyzed and no stochastic gravitational wave background was seen. The limit on a broadband and flat strain power spectrum coming from a point source varies between 8 .5\u00d71049Hz1and 6.1\u00d71048Hz1depending on the source position. Also a limit on gravitational radiation coming from Sco-X1, a Low-Mass X-ray binary and the brightest X-ray source in the sky, is set for each frequency bin (see gure 4-7). Additionally a bound of h2gw(f)<6.25\u00d7105was set on an isotropic gravita- tional wave energy density. The ongoing extended science run also holds the promise of improving on the Nucleosynthesis bound of gw<1.2\u00d7105. 115116Appendix A Tables of Parameters Physical Constants Parameter Symbol Value Units Speed of Light c 299792458 m/s Planck's Constant h 6.6261\u00d71034J s Boltzmann's Constant kB 1.380\u00d71023J/K Electron Charge ec 1.602\u00d71019C Gravitational Constant G 6.674\u00d71011m3/kg/s2 Fine Structure Constant 1/137.036 - Stefan-Boltzmann Constant B 5.67\u00d7108W/m2/K4 Avogadro Constant NA 6.022\u00d71023mol1 Solar mass M 1.9889\u00d71030kg Table A.1: Values of constants from the NIST CODATA 78] (Amorphous SiO Value Heat C 740 J/kg/K Refractive Index (@ 1064 nm) 1.45 - Modulus (substrate) ES 72.80 Modulus (coating) Thickness (coating) dC 8\u00d7106m Loss Angle (substrate) S 1\u00d7107- Loss Angle (coating) C 2\u00d7104- Density 2196 kg/m3 Optic Radius RLOS 0.125 /diameter 0.250 m Optic Thickness hLOS 0.100 m Optic Thickness (BS) hBS 0.040 m Optic Mass mLOS 10.5 kg Optic Mass (BS) mBS 4.2 kg Table A.2: Parameters for the optics are only approximate.

Strictly speaking this is only true as long as the modulation frequency is not much bigger than the pole frequency. It obviously completely fails at multiples of the FSR. For example at the rst FSR the transfer function can be approximated by 2/parenleftBig Denition of basic quantities For a stochastic, stationary background of gravitational waves the expectation value of the elds is: /angbracketlefth A(f,),hA/prime(f/prime,/prime)/angbracketright=H2sided A (f)P()2(,/prime)A,A/prime(ff/prime) (C.1) whereP() is the power distribution across the sky and H2sided A (f) is the 2-sided strain power spectral in polarization A. The goal of the radiometer is to estimate the signal strength from one direction , assuming an unpolarized source, i.e. H1sided(f) = 4H2sided + (f) = 4H2sided \u00d7 (f) (C.2) One factor of 2 comes from going from 2-sided to 1-sided, the other is due to the inter- pretation of H(f) as total power in both polarizations. The superscript \"1 sided\" is dropped from here on. (This is a dierent denition than what Allen and Romano [98] used - their H(f) is 2-sided and per polarization.)

As a result factors of5 4will show up in the nal relations.

Also the dimension of this matrix is N2withNthe number of pixels per map, i.e. this can be a numerical challenge. 128C.5.2 Deconvolved radiometer problem statement In order to get a map that is not convolved with the antenna pattern we have to redene what we mean by an optimal lter. To simplify the notation I dene an additional scalar product that includes the integration over problem: The expectation value of the cross-correlation /angbracketleftY/angbracketrighthas to be equal to the gravi- tational wave P() at , for ,=T 4[Qi,Qi] (C.35) have to be minimized. Weighting all sky directions equally suggests minimizing /integraldisplay d2 ,=min (C.36) To make the notation more transparent it is worth translating the problem to matrix notation. Q=Q, i(f),M=M, i(f) =\u00af,i P1P2,I: identity matrix The 1st index of Q and M is the combined time-frequency summation, the 2nd index is the sky position. With that the problem statement (eq. C.34 a The formal solution goes as follows: Then C.37a, and equation C.37b yieldsK= 0. ThusQ=ML. Translating back to the usual notation we nd that L is nothing but F,. Thus we nd a new optimal deconvolved radiometer Obviously the key problem is calculating the inverse F,of the 2-point correlation integralI,which describes the antenna lobe of the synthetic aperture. Since I, smears the signal out on the typical angular scale =c fd(d: site separation, f: typical signal frequency, c: light speed) any attempt to achieve a signicantly higher resolution than is necessarily going to run into numerical trouble. But there is also a more fundamental reason why this deconvolution is not too meaningful. The described deconvolved radiometer search aims at nding the dis- tributionP() assuming the signal spectrum His the same for the whole sky, an 130assumption that most likely is wrong. The actual shape of the synthetic aperture antenna lobe, and therefore the deconvolved map, however depends on the signal spectrumHwhich has to be put in a priori. Thus, even if there were a signal, the re- sulting sky map would most likely not be accurate. For that reason the deconvolution problem was not pursued in this thesis. 131132Appendix D Correction to the TCS noise coupling D.1 Estimate of bending correction In section 2.8.5 I used the formula for a bimetallic strip 2.40 to estimate the locally induced curvature of the optic. Here I estimate the eect of the geometric constraint of a large optic if the optic is only heated at the center. I do this by dividing the optic into a near zone r<r 1and a far zone r1<r<r 2=Ropticand estimate the energy required to bend the optic. Figure D-1: Schematic of ring ele- ment in far zone Figure D-2: Schematic of ring ele- ment in near zone 133D.1.1 Far zone I focus on a ring element at radius rwith radial size drand thickness h. When the near zone is bent by an angle =/integraltextr1 0dr1/R(r) this ring element gets both translated along the optical axis and rotated by the angle . No energy is required for the translation. But a rotation stretches the circumference by l/l=y /r . Thus the energy required to Here the bending angle changes as =dr/R (r). Again I focus on a ring element at radiusrwith radial size drand thickness h, but now the dominant term comes from bending the element like a rod, i.e. l/l=y d/dr . Thus the energy required to a numerical constant that only depends on the shape of d(r)/dr. For a Gaussian prole with radius w/lessmuchr1we haveK= 1/. Energy balance Based on the bimetallic strip formula 2.40 we estimate a total bending angle 0=6 h2/integraltextr1 0dr/integraltext dzT(z,r). But this does not include the energy required to bend the 134optic in the far zone. The actual total bending angle can thus be estimated by minimizing Energy =ESh3 12/parenleftbigg K(0)2+2lnr2 r1/parenrightbigg (D.3) which the induced displacement /angbracketleft/trianglez3/angbracketrightis linear inthe same correction factor applies to it. D.2 Next order correction to the local coupling Here I show that for an innitely large optic with a notinnitesimally thin heated surface layer the next order correction for the TCS transfer function (Equation 2.38, derived in section 2.8.5) /(2fC ) (Equation 2.34). The small for the expansion is d2/triangle2(/triangle2is the 2-dim Laplace operator on the surface z= 0.) Derivation: Heat diusion: First we need to solve C tT=/triangleT+ 2p(x,y)(z) (the heat diusion equation) up to rst order in d2/triangle2. Note that there is an additional factor of 2 in the source term because the heat is only conducted away on one side. In Fourier space this equation is /parenleftbig k2 z+id2/parenrightbigT=k2 TT+2p the Fourier transform \" kzz\" only for the 0th order, which can be calculated using the Cauchy Integral We now need to solve the elastic equilibrium equation with boundary condition on z= 0 in the half plane z >0: 1 modulus and is the Poisson ratio. Here I am following more or less [ 72] and [ 73], section 8. This problem can be reduced with the Ansatz/arrowrighttophalfv=/arrowrighttophalfv0+, wherefullls the Poisson equation /triangle=1 + 1T (D.12) without boundary condition and/arrowrighttophalfv0fullls equation D.10 with zero source term and 136new step (\" /arrowrighttophalfv\") is solved in [ 73], section 8. Equation D.12 can be integrated: (x,y,z = 4/integraldisplay dx/primedy/prime/integraldisplay (xx/prime)2+ (yy/prime)2+ (z/prime)2(D.14) is true because /triangle/prime 2a1=a3. Inserting this result into equation D.14 and using integration by parts twice to move the Laplace operator over to p(x/prime,y/prime) gives we also have a contribution of T(1). d2/triangle/prime 2cancel each other exactly. Now we can solve for vz. According to [ 73], section everything together and neglecting terms of order ( d4/triangle/prime/prime2 2) to displacement noise: So after all that work the surface displacement /trianglez1=vzremains unchanged up to order ( d4/triangle2 2)! The term proportional todn dT however is scaled by [1 id2/triangle2], resulting in equation D.5. This correction is only in phase though - the magnitude of the transfer function remains totally unchanged up to order (d4/triangle2 2) terms. and J. H. Taylor.
