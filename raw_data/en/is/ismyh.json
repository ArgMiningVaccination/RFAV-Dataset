The flu vaccine is the best source of protection against the worst outcomes from the flu virus. Older populations, as well as those with underlying conditions, are more susceptible to the flu. Keep in mind, every year the flu virus changes, so an updated version of the vaccine is needed to ensure the body develops immunity to the most recent strain of the virus. After vaccination, it takes about two weeks for the body to develop an immune response. "}
