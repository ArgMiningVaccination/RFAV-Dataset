Many people now take herbal medicines or herb al products for their health care in different na tional healt h-care settin gs. However, mass med ia reports of adverse events ten d to be sens ational and give a neg ative impression regarding th e use of herbal medicines in gen eral rather t han iden tifying the cau ses of these events, which may relate to a variety of issues . The safety of herbal medicines has become a major concern to both national health authorities and th e general public. The World Health Organization ( WHO) re ceived an urgent req uest from its Member Sta tes, through the nationa l phar macovigilance centres participating i n the WHO International Drug Monitoring Pr ogramme and drug re gulatory authorities, to assist Me mber States to strengthe n national capacity in monitoring the s afety of herbal medicines and in an alysing the causes o f adverse events, and to share s afety information at n ational, regional and g lobal levels. These guidelines have been developed as WHO's immediate res ponse to thi s request, and to support Member States' efforts in this area in the context of the WHO Internation al Drug Mon itoring Programme , whi ch has bee n in operation since the 1970s. Thus, development of the guide lines has been carried out as a joint project bet ween the Traditional Medicine Tea m (TRM) a nd the Quality, Safety: Medicines Team (QSM) in the Departme nt of Essen tial Drugs and Medicines Policy (EDM) at WHO headq uarters. The recommended approach is to include herbal medicin es in ex isting national pharmacovigilance systems or, where such systems have not yet been developed, to est ablish comprehensive nati onal phar macovigilance system s which incorporate coverage of herbal medicines. As described in th e Introduction to the guidelines, it is not WHO's intention to suggest that different sy stems should be instituted for this purpo se. However, in view of the unique characteristics of the provision and use of h erbal medicines, there are several technical issues that need to be addressed if adequate and effective monitoring is to be int roduced. The guidelines t herefore identify t he part icula r challenges posed in m onitoring the saf ety of herbal medicines effe ctively and propose approaches for overcom ing them. Special attention is al so given to the reporting system fo r adverse reactions to he rbal medicines, a nd to the an alysis of the caus es of the reported adverse reactio ns. In order to handle h erbal medicin es, in parti cular, to analyse the causes of adverse events, na tiona l pharmacovigilanc e centres (or equivalent ins titutions) will need to acquire specific tech nical expert ise. This will inc lude trained personnel in relevant technical areas and facilit ies to analyse the products concerned, for which th ere is often insuffi cient information and lack of access to reliable info rmation support. Many countrie s cur rently lack this ex pertise, in particular, access to suitable analytic al la boratories. Member States have therefore recommended the e stablishment of regional labor atories specializing in v WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems the analysis of herbal products. WHO enco urages Member States to ex plore the feasibility of this proposal. To further t he implementation of t hese guidelines, WHO plans to organize a series of training workshops for Member States, in collabo ration with the WHO Collaboratin g Centres for International Drug Monitoring and for Traditional Medicine. N ational capacity in monitoring the safety of herbal medicines will be further strengthen ed t hrough national tr aining workshops on topics such as, broadening reporting schemes , acq uiring technical ex pertise at n ational pharmacovigilance centres, and promoting awareness. Training of practitioners who provid e herbal medicines will also be cruc ial. The guidelines also arti culate technical issues relating to data manage ment and communication. The Uppsala Monitoring Centre, Uppsala, Sweden (UMC) has tomical-therapeuti c-che mical classif ication (HATC) as a coding tool to permit the inclusion of in dividual herbal products in the globa l WHO database of adverse drug re action (ADR) reports f or pharmacovigi lance purposes. The summary explanation of the proposed syst em by UMC is annex ed to the guidelines. Although the system re prese nts a valuable attempt at coding herbal medicines, it ma y not be perfect fo r covering all types of herbal products, in particular, traditional medicines that are used under uni que concepts and with unique term inologies. M ember States are encouraged to offer suggestions, on the basis of their national ex perience in the day-to-day operation of national pharmacovigilance, as to how cla ssifica tion could be approached in a more comprehensive manner and in a way th at meets their n ational circumstances. WHO, in collaboration with UMC, will work with Member States to continue development of the syste m. Currently, t he majority of adverse events relat ed to the use of herbal products and herbal medicines t hat are rep orted ar e attributable either to poor product quality or to improper use. Inadequate regulatory measures, weak q uality control systems and largely uncontrolled distribu tion channels (inc luding mail order and Internet sales) may have been contributing to the occurrence of such events. In order to expand knowledge about genuine adverse reactions to herbal medicines, and to avoid wasting scare resources for identifying an d analysing adverse events, events resulting from suc h situations will need to be reduced or eliminated. Member States are therefor e encouraged to strengthe n national regulation, registration and quality assur ance an d control of herbal medicines. In addition, na tional healt h authorities shou ld give greater attention to consumer education and to q ualified practice in the provision of herbal medicines. WHO has welcomed the active participatio n of drug regulatory authorities and national ph armacovigilance centres , amon g others, in the d evelopment of these guidelines. This has provided a usef ul starting point for strengthe ning communicat ion between these authoritie s, which will b e needed to ensure progress towards the c ommon goal - the safety of herbal medicines. Dr Xiaorui Zhang Coordinator, Traditional Medicine Department of Essen tial Drugs and Medicines Policy World Health Organizati on vi Acknowledge ments Acknowledgement s The World Health Organization (WHO ) wishes t o express its sincere appreciation to Health Canad a, in particula r the Natu ral Health Products Directorate, for kindly hosting the WHO Cons ultation on Safety Monitoring of Herbal Medicines in Va ncouver, Canada, in Fe bruary 2004 (Annex 1), with its financial support. WHO also wishes to thank the Minist ry of Health, Welfare and Sports, Netherlands for its gen erous financial contribution to WHO in support of the WHO Wo rking Group Meeting on Safety Monitoring and Pharmacovigilance of Herbal Medicines held in Amsterdam, Neth erlands in Oct ober 2002, and t he WHO Con sultation on Safety Monitori ng of Herba l Medicines held in Vancouver, Canada , in February 2004. Special t hanks are extended to Dr Kees van Grootheest, Director, Netherlands Pharmac ovigilance Foundation (LAREB), and his t eam, for their assista nce in organizing the 2 002 meeting. WHO ackn owledges the valuable c ontribu tion of Dr Ralph Edwards, Director, WHO Co llaborating Ce ntre for Internatio nal Safety Monitoring at the Uppsala Monitoring Centre, Uppsala, Sweden , and his team, and Profess or David Coulter, Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme, Dep artment of Preventive and Social Medicine, School of Medicine , University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand, to t he preparation of the dr aft guidelines. The Organization is grateful to the partic ipants in the two consultative meetings for their work in reviewing the draft guidelines. Thanks are also due to the more than 4 00 e xperts in over 102 countries, including those at the national pharmacovigilance centres participat ing in the WHO International Drug Monitoring Programme, national d rug regu latory authorities, poisons centres and nation al health authorities, as well as, WHO Colla borating Centres for Traditional Medicines, and membe rs of WHO Advisory Panel on Traditional Medicines, who review ed and provided com ments and advice on the draft guidelines. Preparation of the gu idelin es has also benef ited from technical support from releva nt internati onal and nongovernmental organizations , including associations of health profe ssions and of manufacturers of herbal medicines, a nd consumer associations. Finally, W HO expres ses its appreciation to The Coun cil f or International Organizations of Medical Sciences and th e Upps ala Monitoring Centre, Uppsala, Sweden for permission to reproduce the materi al included in Annex es 3 and 4, and Part II of the guidelines, respecti vely. vii Part I WHO Gu idelines on safety moni toring of herbal medicines in pharmacovigilance systems General introd uction 1. General introducti on 1.1 Introduction Safety is a fundamental princip le in the provision of herbal medicines a nd herbal products for health care, and a critical comp onent of quality contr ol. These guidelines provide pra ctical techni cal guidance for monitoring the safety of herbal medicines within pharmacovigilanc e systems. The s afety monit oring of herbal medicines is compared an d cont raste d with that of other medicines currently undertaken in the context of the WHO International Drug Monitoring Programme. While there are regulatory and cultural differences in th e preparation and use of different types of medicines, they are all equally important from a pharm acovigilance perspective. The guidelines were develope d with the view that, withi n current pharmacovigilance systems, monit oring of the safety of medicines should be enhanced and broadened in ways that w ill allow the successful monitoring of herbal medicines. It is not the intent ion to suggest that diffe rent system s should be instituted for this purpose. The guide lines should therefore be considered i n conjunction with the publication entitled, Safety monitoring of medicinal products: guidelines for setting up and runni ng a pharmacovigilance centre (1) , which is reproduced as Part II of this publication. The inclusion of herba l medicines in pharma covigilance systems is becoming increasingly important given the g rowin g use of herbal products and herbal medicines globally. For example, in the Un ited States of America, some US$ 17 billion was spent by more than 158 million Americans in 2000 (2). Further, a recent study indicated that more t han 7 0% of the German population reported using \"natu ral medicines\" and that, for mo st of t hem, herbal medicinal products were the first choice in the treatm ent of minor diseases or disorders (3). The worldwide consumption of herbal medicine s is enormous, so that, in terms of population exposure al one, it is essentia l to id entify the risks associated with their use. Safety of herbal medicines is therefore an important pu blic health issue. Herbal medicines are freq uently us ed in conjunction with other medicines, a nd it is essential to understand the conse quences of such combined use and monitor whether a ny adverse effects are arising. Th is can be achieved most readily within existing pharmacovigila nce system s. 1.2 Bac kground Problems Among consumers, the re is a widespread misconception that \" natural\" alway s means \" safe\", and a common belief that remedies from natural origin are harmless an d carry no risk. However, some medicinal plants are inherently tox ic. 1 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems Further, as with all me dicines, herbal medi cines are expected to have side effects, which may be of an adverse na ture. Some adverse event s reported in as sociation with herbal products are attr ibutable to problems of quality. Major causes of such events are adulteration of herbal produc ts with undeclared other medicines and potent phar maceutical s ubstances, s uch as corticosteroids an d non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents. Adverse events may al so arise from the mistake n use of the wrong species of medicinal plants, incorrect dosing, errors in the use of herbal medicines both by healt h-care providers and consumers, int eractions with other medicines, and use of products cont aminate d with potentially ha zardous substances, such as toxic metals, path ogenic microorganism s and agrochemical residues. The following examples demonstrat e the range of problems encountered with the use of herbal medicines and products. Some herbal products were found to contain 0.1 -0.3 mg of betameth ason e per capsule after some patie nts develope d corticosteroid-l ike side effects. Owing to misidentific ation of the medi cinal plant species, plant materials containing aristolochic acid were used for ma nufacturing herbal products, which caused severe kidney failure in patients in several countries. Reports have been received by drug safe ty moni toring agencies of prolonged prothrombin times, increased use of Ginkgo biloba . One of the most well known tra ditionally used herbal medicines caused severe, sometimes fa tal cases o f interstitial pneumonia when u sed in conjunction with interferon. Adverse events t hus far repo rted in relation t o herbal products are freq uently attributable either to poor quality or to improper use, and it is therefore difficult to distinguish genuine adverse reactions to herbal medicines and herbal products until the cause of such e vents has been identified. Curr ent situ ation Despite the growing interest in the s afety of herbal medicines, national surveillance system s to moni tor an d evaluate adverse reactions assoc iated with herbal medicines are rare, even among t he more th an 70 Mem ber States participatin g in the WH O International Drug M onitoring Pr ogramme. Moreove r, there is a l ack of effec tive comm unicatio n on this subjec t at all le vels, from international to lo cal. A recent W HO su rvey s howed that around 90 countries, less than h alf of WHO's Member Sta tes, cu rrently regulate herbal medicines, and an even smaller proportion has systems in place for the regulation/qualification of providers of herbal medicines. Moreov er, there are disparities in regulation between countries, and this has se rious implications for international access to and distribution of such products. National ph armacovigilance sy stem s shou ld be closely linked to natio nal drug regulatory systems. To function properly, a nationa l safety monitoring programme for herbal medicines should be operated alongside an effective national drug regulatory system with the will and the potential to react to signals emana ting from reports of adverse effects of herbal medicines and to ta ke proper regulatory measures. 2 General introd uction At the national level, the capacit y for repor ting adverse events on herbal medicines, a nalysing the ir causes and lear ning from past experience is seriously hampered in many Member States by the lack of methodological uniformity in identification and meas urement, the lack of information on adverse effects of herbal medicines, inadequate repor ting sc hemes, fear of professional liability , and inadeq uate information syst ems relating to the use of herbal medicines. Current knowledge of the epidemiology of adverse reactions to herbal medicines, such as frequency of occurrence and causes, is very limited. Action r equired For the safe ty of those using herbal me dicines, four complementary ac tions are needed: clear identification of th e nature of adverse events manage ment of the risks institution of measure to prevent adverse events good communication of the risks an d benefits of herbal medicines. These require: increased ability to le arn from identi fied adverse events through bette r reporting systems, skilful technical investigation of incidents and respo nsible sharing of d ata greater capacity to anticipate adve rse events and to probe systemic weaknes ses that migh t lead to problems identification of existing knowledge re sources, within and outside the healt h sector improveme nts in the health-care deliv ery system, so t hat structures are reconfigured, incentives are realigned, and safety and q uality are placed at the core of t he system In 2 000 and 200 1, the annual meeti ngs of n ational pharm acovigilance centres participatin g in th e WHO Internat ional Drug Monitoring Programme req uested WHO to provide urge nt support to Me mber States in developin g nationa l systems for the safet y monitoring of herb al and traditional medicines. This was echoed by a recommendation mad e at th e Third WHO Consultation on Selected Medicinal Plants, and at the WHO Info rmal Meeting on Methodologies for Quality Co ntrol of Fini shed Herbal Prod ucts, both held in Ottawa, C anada, i n July 2001. The Intern ational Conference of Drug Regulatory Authorities (ICDRA) also made recommenda tions to WHO in 1999 and 20 02 that it should support Member States in stre ngthening their ca pacity in these areas. In addition, resolution WHA56.31 on traditional medi cine, adopted at the Fifty-Si xth World Health Asse mbly in May 200 3, urged Memb er States to s et up or ex pand and strengthe n existing national drug safety monit oring syste ms to moni tor herbal medicines a nd other tra ditional practices. Action needed by WHO to respond t o these requests includes: provision of technical guidance to facilit ate the expansion of existing systems to monitor and report adverse dru g reactions to herbal medicines or the establishme nt of comprehensive nat ional drug s afety monit oring systems that 3 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems incorporate the s afety monitoring of he rbal medicines, where these do no t yet exist support to countries in strengtheni ng their pharmacovigilance syste m for herbal medicines, allowing for th e in volvement of healt h-care providers, consumers and manufac turers. WHO has t aken t he lea d in tackling the need for drug safety monitor ing since 1970 (resolution WHA23.13 on inte rnational monitoring of adverse reactions to drugs, 1970 ). The WHO Internati onal Dr ug Monitoring Programme, togethe r with the WHO Collaborating Centre in Sweden, the Uppsala Monitorin g Centre (UMC), has instituted a coherent progra mme of action for pharmacovigilance, which includes the establishmen t of a programme for exchange of safety information, maintena nce of the global WHO database of adverse drug reaction (ADR) repo rts (hereafter referred to as the g lobal WHO database), and the provision of numerous guidelines on moni toring drug saf ety. It also seeks to bridge the gap between industry and re gulatory authorities. As an i mmediate response to the need f or pharmacovigi lance for herbal medicines, WHO has increased its efforts to promote their safe ty moni toring within the context of the WHO International Drug Monitorin g Programme. Where there is a national drug safety monito ring system in place, there is a clear need to expand its scope to include herbal med icines. If no such syste m exists, there is an urgent need to estab lish such a system, w hich should include monitoring of herbal m edicines. However, adding herbal medicines to a list of target substances for a national drug safety monitoring activities is not enough in itself. Because of the particula r nature of the distribution and use of herbal medicines, adeq uate and effective moni toring demands special re quirements, includ ing: expanding the source of case reports, for example by: - invol ving a ll providers of herbal medicines, incl uding providers o f traditional medicine an d complement ary/altern ative medicine, according to national c ircumstances - strengthening the role of pro viders , such as ph armacists and health-ca re professionals, working in the comm unity - involving manufacturers of herbal medicines - facilitating c onsumer reporting - developing systems of information ex change involving drug information centres, poisons centres, consumer organizations and ma nufacturers establishing a system fo r the ex change of regula tory and q uality inform ation on herbal m edicines among nationa l pharmacovigilance centres and n ational drug regulatory authorit ies strengthe ning capacity to carry out monitoring of herbal medicines at national pha rmacovigila nce centres by: - training staf f in relevant technical areas - ensuring access to facilities for anal ysing products suspected of causing adverse reactions - providing access to reliable information developing a s tandard classification and/o r coding system for herbal medicines, with sta ndardized terms and definit ions strengthe ning communication and awarenes s at all levels ( global, regi onal, national, loc al and community) and amon g key players (inte rnational bodies, 4 General introd uction regulatory authorities, national phar macovigilance cen tres, health -care providers and consumers). In response to these needs, WHO has developed these guide lines. It also plans to organize a s eries of training workshops to strengthen nati onal capacity in safety monitoring of herbal medicines within pharma covigilance systems in Member States. 1.3 Objectives The objectives of the se guidelines are to: support Member States , in the cont ext of the WHO International Drug Monitoring Programme, to strengthe n national pharmacovigilance capacity in order to carry out effective safety monitoring of herbal medicines provide technical guida nce on the prin ciples of good pharmacovigilance and the inclusion of herbal medicines in ex isting n ational drug safety monitoring systems; and where these systems ar e not in place, to facilitate the establishme nt of an inclusive national drug safety monitoring system provide sta ndard defin itions of te rms relating to pharm acovigilance, and safety mo nitoring of herbal medicin es promote and strengthe n internationally coordinated information ex change on pharmacovigilance, and safety moni toring of herbal medicines among Member States promote the safe and proper use of herbal medicines. The regulation of herbal medicines and their place in national he alth-care systems differs from country to country, and these guidelines will therefore need to be adapte d to meet the needs of t he local situation. 1.4 Glossary The terms used in Part I of these gui delines are defined below. Terms rela ting to herbal medic ines These terms and th eir definitions have been s elected and adapted fr om other WHO documents and guidelines that ar e widely used by the WHO Member States, such as the Gener al guidelines for methodolo gies on research and eval uation o f traditional medicine (4). These definitions may differ from those included in national reg ulations, an d are theref ore, for reference only. Herbal medicines include herbs, her bal materi als, herbal pr eparations and finished herbal produ cts. In some countries h erbal medici nes may contain, by tradition, natural orga nic or inorganic active ingredients t hat are not of plant origin (e.g. animal and mineral mat erials). 5 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems Herbs incl ude crude plant material, such as leaves, flowers, fruit, s eeds, stems, woo d, bark, roots, rhizomes or other pla nt parts, which may be e ntire, fragmented or powdered. Herb al mat erials incl ude, in addition to herbs, fresh juices, gums, fixed oils, essential oils, resins an d dry pow ders of herbs. In some countries, these materials may be processed by various local procedures, s uch as steaming, roasting or stir-baking with honey, alcoholic beve rages or other materials. Herb al prepa rations are the basis for finished he rbal products and may include comminuted or powdered herbal material s, or extracts, tinctures and fatty oils of herbal materials . They are produced by ex traction, fractionation, purification, concentration, or other ph ysical or biolog ical processes. They also include preparations made by steeping or heating he rbal materia ls in alcoholic beverages and /or honey, or in other materials. Finished herbal products consist of her bal preparations made from one or more herbs. If more than one herb is used, the term \" mixture herbal product\" can also be used. Finished herbal produc ts and mix ture herbal products ma y contain excipients in addition to the active ingredients. However, fini shed products or mixture h erbal prod ucts to which chemically defined active substances have been added, incl uding synthetic compounds and/or isolated constituents from herbal ma terials, are n ot considered to be herbal. Traditional use of herbal medicines refers to the long historical us e of these medicines. Their use is well established and wi dely acknowledged to be safe and effective, and may be ac cepted by national auth orities. Therapeutic activity refers to the su ccessful prevention, diagnosis and t reatment of physical and mental illnesses. Treatm ent includes b eneficial alteration or regulation of the physical and men tal status of the body an d developm ent of a sense of general well-bei ng as well as improvem ent of symptoms. Active ingredients refer to ingredients of her bal medicin es with the rapeutic activity. Wh ere the active ingredients have been identified, the preparation of the finished herbal product shou ld be standardized to ensure that it always contains a defined amount of the active ingred ients, providin g adeq uate analytical methods are available. In case s where it is not possible to identify t he active ingredients, the whole herbal medicine may be considered as one active ingredient. Traditional medicine is the sum total of the knowledge, skills and practices based on the theories, beliefs and experi ences indigenous to different cult ures, whether explicable or not, used in th e m aintenance of health and in th e prevention, diagnosis, i mprovement or treatment of ph ysical and mental illness. The terms \"complem entary me dicine \"alternative with \"traditional medicine\" in some countries. Terms rela ting to safety monitoring of medicinal products The terms and definitions below hav e been adopted by the national pharmacovigilance centres participat ing in the WHO International Drug 6 General introd uction Monitoring Programme. Different medical paradigms may view clinical events differently i n their relationship to herb al medicines, whe ther they are expected therapeutic outcomes or adverse reactions. Side effect . Any unintended effect of a phar maceutical product oc curring at doses norm ally used in humans t hat is related to the pharmacological p roperties of the drug. Adverse event/experie nce. Any untoward medical occurrence that may present during treatment with a pharmace utical product but that does not necessarily have a caus al relationsh ip with this treatment . Serious adver se event. Any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death requires inp atient hospitalization or prolongatio n of existing hospitalization results in persistent or si gnificant disability/inca pacity is life-threatening. Adverse reaction . A response to a drug that is n oxious and unintended, and t hat occurs at d oses norma lly used in humans fo r the prophylax is, diagnosis or therapy of d isease, or for the modi fication of physiological f unction. Unexpected adverse re action. An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with domestic labelling or market authorization, or expected from the charac teristics of the drug. Signal . Reported information on a possible causal relationship between a n adverse event and a d rug, the relation ship being unknown or incompletely documented previously. Us ually, more than a single re port is required to generate a signal, depen ding upon the seriousne ss of t he eve nt and the quality of the information. Spontaneou s reporting . A system whereby case reports of adverse drug events are voluntarily subm itted by health professionals and phar maceutical manufacturers to the natio nal regulatory authority. Pharmacovigilance is the science and activities relating to the detection, asses smen t, understan ding and prevention of adverse effects or any other possible drug-related prob lems (see also section 2). National pharmacovigilance centre . A single, governmentally re cognized centr e (or part of an integrated system) wit hin a country with the c linical and scientifi c expertise to collect, collate, analyse and gi ve advice on all information related to drug safety. 7 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems 8 Pharmacovigilance and the WHO Intern ational Drug Monitoring Programme 2. Pharmacovigilance and the WHO International Drug Monitoring Progr amme 2.1 What is pharm acovigilanc e? The WHO publication entitled The impor tance of ph armacovigilance: safety monitoring of medicinal products (5) , describes pharmacovigila nce as follows. Pharmacovigilance is the sci ence a nd activities relating to t he detecti on, underst andin g and preve ntion of adv erse effects o f drugs or any other possib le drug-r elated problems. Recently, its concerns h ave been widen ed to inc lude: herbals traditional and complemen tary med icines blood produc ts biologicals medical devices vaccine s. Many other issues are also of relevanc e to the science: substan dard medicine s medicat ion er rors lack of efficacy reports use of medicines for indications that are not approved and for whic h there is inad equate scientific basis case reports o f acute and c hronic poison ing assessment of drug-related mortality abus e and misuse of medic ines advers e int eractions of me dicine s with chemicals, other medic ines and food. The specific aims o f pharmacovig ilance are to: improve pa tient ca re and safety in relati on to the use of medi cines a nd all medical and parame dical interventions improve publ ic he alth and safety in relation to the use of med icines contri bute to the a ssessm ent of benef it, harm, effe ctiveness an d risk of medicine s, encoura ging their s afe, rat ional and m ore effect ive (inc luding cost- effective) u se promot e underst anding, educ ation and clini cal t raining in pharmacov igilance and its effect ive com munic ation t o the publ ic. These aims of pharmacovigi lance can be achieved (1) by: early detection of hithert o unknown adverse reactions and in teractions detection of increases in frequency of (known) ad verse reactions 9 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems identification of risk factors and possible mechanisms un derlying adverse reactions estimation of the quantitative aspect s of be nefit/risk, and a nalysi s and disseminati on of the information need ed to improve the presc ription, dispensing, provision and regulation of medicines. The ultimate goal of p harmacovigilance is the safe and p roper use of effective medicines of all types. 2.2 How does pharm acovigil ance operat e? It must be emphasized that t here is no difference in principle between t he saf ety monitoring of herbal medicines and that of ot her medicines. The WHO Internationa l Drug Monitoring Programme Under the WHO In ternational Drug Monitoring Programme, national pharmacovigilance centres designat ed by the competent health authorities are responsible for the collection, processing an d evaluation of cas e reports of suspected adverse reactions supplied by health-care professionals (mainly spontaneou s reporting by physicians of re actions as sociated with the use of prescri bed medicines). The Programme is descri bed in t wo pub lications: Safety monitoring of medicinal products: gu idelines for setting up and running a pharmacovigilance centre (1) , chap ters 7 a nd nd The importance o f pharmacovigilance: safety monito ring of medicinal products (5) , especially chapters 3 and 4. The Programme currently comprises a netw ork of more than 70 national pharmacovigilance centres that ope rate indepe ndently, but whose func tions are coordinated and facilitated by WHO and UMC. UMC manages the global WH O database to which all c ase reports received by the nation al pharmacovigilance centres are sent. UMC uses the glo bal WH O database to identify/det ect signals of new adverse reactions from the cum ulative data and to communicate risk asses smen ts back to the nation al pharmacovigilance centres and to others concerned with drug safety. The core functions in this collabor ative in ternational programme can be summarized as follows. Functions of national pharmacovigilance cen tres Continuous collecti on of reports of suspected adverse reacti ons for medicines on the market Assessmen t of case reports in respect of: - quality of documentation - causality assessmen t - coding to internationa l standards using the appropriate medicine classification (the anatomical-therapeu tic-chem ical (ATC) classificatio n), adverse reaction classification (W HO Adve rse Reaction Terminolo gy (WHO- ART)) and the Medical Di ctionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) - clinica l relevance - qual ity control, in ular identifi cation of duplicate repo rts 10 Pharmacovigilance and the WHO Intern ational Drug Monitoring Programme Transmission in suitable format of th e asse ssed r eports to UMC Generation of hypotheses or the identifi cation of signals. These activities may be strengthe ned by a sea rch of the global WHO database (m anaged by UMC) for similar r eports Communication of relevant safety information to the national and regional regulatory authorities, health profe ssionals, ph armaceutical companies and other players as appropriate Further investigation of signals, risk factors or pharmacological mechanisms Receipt and communication as ap propri ate of safety information resulting from analys es by UMC and from r egulatory agencies, cas e reports an d the literature Provision of feedback to reporters Timely advice to health-care profes sionals and consumers on drug s afety issues Education and training Information sharing at re gional and g lobal levels. Functions of UMC Receipt and storage of re ports from national phar macovigilance centres Provision of facilities to enable national pharmacovig ilance centres to search the global WHO database Generation of signals from the global WHO database Communication of signa l analyses to national ph armacovigilance centres and clinica l review of the analyses by experts Provision of technical as sistance to national phar macovigilance centres Facilitation of communi countries Maintenanc e and devel opment of WHO-ART and th e use of MedDRA within the WHO In ternational Drug Monitoring Programme Training of national pha rmacovigila nce centre personnel Standardiza tion of procedures relati ng to pharm acovigilance activities Publication of relevant documents Provision of data as app ropriate to other parties. Among the many playe rs that need to be invo lved in pharmacovigi lance systems at different levels are: q ualified health professionals s uch as providers of medicines (physicians, dentists, pharma cists ) and nurs es, researchers and academics, media writers, the phar maceut ical industry, na tional and regional drug regula tory authorities, patient s/con sumers, lawyers, poisons centres, drug information centres, and internationa l and regional health org anizations (6). In collabora tion with UMC, national p harmacovigilance centres have already achieved a great deal in t he following areas (5): collecting and analysing case reports of adverse drug reaction s distinguishing signals fr om \"background noise\" making reg alerting prescribers, manu facturers and th e public to new risks of ad verse reactions. The framework of values and practice fo r the collection, analysis and subseq uent communication of drug safety is sues is provided by the Erice Declaration (Annex 2). Is sues of privacy and confidentiality in relation to pers onal healt h data are covered in Annex 3. 11 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems 12 Challenges in monitoring the safety of herba l medicines 3. Challenges in monitoring the safety of herbal medi cines 3.1 Regulation, quality assurance and control Regulation National regulation and registration of herbal medicines vary from country to country. Wh ere herbal m edicines are regula ted, they may be categorized as either prescription or non-prescription medi cines. Herbal products may also be categorized other t han as medicines. Moreover, the regulatory status of a particular herbal product may differ in different countries. The national regulatory f ramework usually also incl respective substances. Re gulatory status cons equently determines the access to or distribution route of these products. If trade in a particular herbal product is made between countries where different regulatory status is given, reclassifica tion of the regulatory status in the importing country depends not on the nat ure or characteristics (m edical or therapeutic value) of th e product it self, but on the regulatory framework of the importing country. Further, herbal prod ucts categorized other than as medicines and foods are becoming increasingly popular, and there is potential for adverse reactions due to lack of regulation, we aker q uality control systems and loose distribution channels (in cluding mail order and Internet s ales). National regulatory information on herb al med icines is not fully shared among national re gulatory authorities, a nd is often not sh ared between national regulatory authorities and national safet y monitoring/pharma covigilance centres. Almost all new med icines are introduc ed to the market as p rescription medicines, and a sign ificant volume of post-marketing safety data from spontaneou s reporting will have been realized over time. At some stage, some of these medicines will s ubsequently be rec lassified as non-prescription medicines and will become major sources of self-medic ation. However, in many countries, a significant proportion of herb al products enters directly into the non-prescription medicines category rather than by re classif ication fro m the prescription medicines category. Quality assurance and control Quality assurance and control measures, such as national quality specification and stand ards for herbal materials, g ood manufacturing practices (G MP) for herbal medicines, labelling, and licensi ng schemes for manufacturing, imports and marketing, should be in place in every country where he rbal medicines are regulated. These me asures are vital for ensu ring the safe ty and efficacy of herbal 13 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems medicines. Weak regulation and q uality co ntrol may result in a high incidence of adverse reactions attributable to poor qua lity of herbal medicines, in particular resulting from adulteration with un declared potent substances and/or contaminati on with pot entially haz ardous subs tances and r esidues. Requirements and methods for quality co ntrol of finish ed herbal products, particularly for mix ture herbal produc ts, are far more complex than for other pharmaceuticals. The q uality of such produc ts is influenced by the quality of the raw material used. Good agricultural and good collect ion practices (G ACP) for medicinal plants, including plant sele ction and cultivation, are therefore important measures (7). National/regional pharmacopoeia s National a nd regiona l pharmacopoeias de fine q uality specifications and standards f or herbal materials and some herbal preparations, such as essential oils and powdered herbal materials. Use and inclusion of herbal materials in such pharmacopoeias are ba sed on local availabi lity of these products. Ava ilability is dependent on the original medicinal plants, which ha ve ecologically an d environmentally specific habitats. Theref ore, even if the same pharmacopoeial monograph name is given to a herbal mate rial, its listing in one pharmacopoeia may refer to a different original medici nal plant and/or processing me thod from that d efined in anot her (see also section 4.3 , Reporting of suspected adverse reactions, under Recording and coding the ide ntity of herbal medicines). Action r equired As with other medicines for human use, he rbal medicines should be covered by a drug regulatory framework to ensure that they conform to req uired stan dards of safety, quality and efficacy. 3.2 Appro priate use Providers of herbal medicines A variety of health-care professionals se rve as qualified providers of herbal medicines, accord ing to each countr y's national health-care delivery system an d legislative fr amework. In those countries where herbal medicine s are classified as prescription medicines, prescribers and dis pensers ot her than physicians, dentists a nd pharmacists are so metime s excluded from current reportin g systems . In many countries, prescriptions are no t required to obtain herbal medicines since these are categorized as no n-prescrip tion medicines or pr oducts suitable for self-care. Providers of herbal medicines in this category are not normally physicians. They incl ude pro viders of traditional and complementary or alternative medicine as well as co mmunity pharmacists and nurses. Action r equired All providers of herbal medi cines should play a role in monitoring the safety of non-prescription herbal medi cines. Nurses are becoming in creasingly involved in this area and are making a valuable co ntribution to safety monitoring. For 14 Challenges in monitoring the safety of herba l medicines providers of herbal medicines to be effect ively i nvolved, it is essential to create an a tmosph ere of trust to enable the sh aring of knowledge about the use and safety of herbal medicin es. Lack of proper knowledge of herbal medicines Providers of medicines, such as ph ysicians, nurses and pharmacists, may have little trainin g in and understanding of ho w herbal medicin es affect the health of their patients, who are often also taking other medicines, prescription or non- prescript ion. An appropriate knowledge base is also relevant to diagn ostic and treatment decision-making. Othe r he alth-ca re professionals who are not providers of herbal med icines are al so lik ely to be poorly in formed about these products and how they are being used. If they see patients who are taking herbal medicines, t hey should ask about t heir use. Health profes sionals who work in poisons centres and he alth information services also need t o be inform ed about herbal medicines. The use of medicinal plants is the most common form of traditional medication, worldwide. Herbal medicines are used wi thin many different he aling traditions with differe nt knowledge bases and so there is still a quest ion as to the suitabi lity of the categ ories defined in section 4.2. Traditional medicines are increasingly being used outside the co nfines of traditional cultures and far beyond t raditional geographical areas witho ut proper knowledge of their use and the und erlying principles. They are also being used in different doses, extracted in d ifferent wa ys and use d for non-t raditional indications. The concomitant use of traditional medicines with other medicines, which is now quite fre quent, is quite outside the traditi onal contex t and has become a particular safety concern. Patient/con sumer attit udes to her bal medicin es As mentioned in section 1, there is often a misconception that \"n atural\" means \"safe\" a nd many consumers believe that reme dies of natural origin ca rry no risk. Patients who use herbal medicines and ot her m edicines together, as is often the case, will often not mention the use of herbal medicines to their physician. Likewise, p atients commonly fail t o mentio n the use of o ther medicines to their providers of herbal medicines. Health-care professionals and providers of herbal medi cines should ask patients directly, res pectfully an d persistent ly what ot her medicines they are taking, includ ing pr escription m edicines, herbal medicines and other health products for self-care. Action r equired The education of health-care professional s, providers of herbal medicines an d patients/consumers is vital for the prevention of potentially serious risks from misuse of he rbal medicin es. 15 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems 16 Safety monitoring of herbal m edicines 4. Safety monitoring of her bal medicines 4.1 Sources o f reports The Council for International Or ganizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) Working Group V has recommended tha t, as a general guiding princi ple, emphasis sh ould be placed on the q uality of a report and not on its source. Thus, the value of a report lies not in who made it, b ut in the care and thoroughness with which it is prepared, documented, received, recorded, followed-up , clarifie d and an alyse d (8). However, the source of a report can be an important factor in evaluating the report as it may affect the qualit y and value of the infor mation. The nature, degree and even feasibil ity of any follow-up will also b e highly dependent o n the source . The most common sources of information on adverse events and rea ctions to medicines are clinical trials and spon taneous reports ( voluntary, u nsolicited communications on ma rketed med icinal products). The latter ordinarily far exceed the former in n umbers and type, especially seri ous reports, over the lifetime of a product. In some countr ies, adverse reaction rep orting by physicians is mandator y; such reports are regarded as spo ntaneous. In many countries, providers of herbal medicines other th an physicians, dentist s, pharmacists and nurse s are ex cluded fr om reporting systems. If a dequate coverage of herbal medicines is to be achieved, national reporting schemes should be developed to include all pro viders of herbal medici nes (both prescribers and dispensers), and provid ers of traditional, complementa ry and alternative medicine, accordin g to national circumstances . Reports fro m health -care professio nals Internation ally, adverse drug reaction reportin g system s in the post- marketing safety surveillance setting depend primar ily on voluntary reporting by health- care profes sionals, preferably those dire ctly a ssociated with the care of the patient/consumer (i.e. t he patient's prim ary health-care provider or specialist). This is appropriate, since the underst anding of adverse drug reactions depends on medical knowledge and such professio nals should be aware of the patient's medical history and attu ned to the subtleti es of clinica l diffe rential diagnosis. A substantial proportion of herbal m edicines are non-prescripti on medicines, and many come directly in to this category without prior post-marketing safet y monitoring as prescription medicin es. It is the refore most important to take measures to strengthe n pharmacovigil ance activity in the non-prescription medicines setting. Com munity pharmacists and nurses can play a particularly useful role in monitoring the safe ty of non-prescription medicines, although many such products are sold outside pharmacies. 17 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems Reports fro m consu mers The involvement of consumers in the use of herbal medicines and herbal products in health care, and their concern regarding poss ible adverse effects should be valued positi vely. Consumer reports on adverse reactions should be accepted as a serious source of info rmation, which can contribute to th e identification of signals for unkn own effects of herbal medicines. For non-prescription medicines, ofte n tak en without health professional invol vement, reports received dire ctly from consumers may provide the onl y source of s ignals. With herbal medici nes in the non-p rescription medicines setting, t here is clearly an esse ntial role for consumer report ing. Consumer reporting, in one form or another, is the refore an essential development if adequat e information on ri sk is to be obtained. However, only a few national regulatory authorities currently explicitly re quire colle ction of dire ct reports fro m consumers. The CIOMS Wo rking Group proposes several policy approaches and practices aimed at ensuri ng that consumer reports a re treated with appropriate respect and that th ere is a rational approach for handling the m (Annex 4). Manufacturers1 Manufacturers of herba l medicines could be a s ource of information on adverse events associated with their products . Some countries include reporting of adverse events by manufacturers as pa rt of their regulatory f ramework. Consumers may report directly to c ompani es or their repres entatives. However, there are rea sons other t han concern about an adverse effect that might p rompt a consumer to contact a company. These include legal concerns and, most frequently, requests for further infor mation abo ut the product. Another source of consumer r eports derives from a vari ety of industry programmes in which adverse reaction information may be soli cited; such cas es are not regarded as spontaneou s reports. Report s from othe r sou rces Problems associated with herbal m edicine s may be report ed as toxicity to the following. Nation al poisons centre s. Where resources are very limite d in the national situation and where no pharmacovigil ance cen tre has been establishe d, a poisons centre could play a core role in pharmacovigilance for and safety monitoring of herbal medicines. Drug information centres may also be a first point of contact and may provide a wealth of clinical infor mation. Nati onal pharmacovigilance centres should have a good level of communication with such centres. Consu mer or ganizations receive com plaints about any type of prod uct in the marketplace and ma y obtain relevant information about herbal medicines Clinical trials and studies can also be a source of information (se e section 4. 2). 1 For the pur pose of these guidelines, the te rm \"manufacturer\" refers to the producer, importer, distributor or marketer o f a finish ed herbal product an d, where app licable, to the hol der of the ma rketing authoriz ation or regi strati on for tha t product i n the country in que stion. 18 Safety monitoring of herbal m edicines 4.2 Herbal products target ed for safety monitoring In order to obtain co mprehensive covera ge, it is useful to think of herba l products in the following categories: according to their regulatory status - herbal medicines in the pres cript ion medicines category - herbal medicines in the non-pr escri ption medicines categor y - other herbal products in tended for use in he alth care according to their registration/marketing status - herbal medicines undergoing the new drug development process: in clinica l trial s prior to national drug regulatory approval - herbal medicines undergoing the n ew drug de velopment process: under post-market ing safety surveillance - herbal medicines undergoing re-eva luation under the current protocol: in clinica l trial s - herbal medicines undergoing re-eva luation under the cur rent protoc ol: under post-marketing s afety surveillance - herbal medicines on the market: und er post-marketing safe ty surveillance - other herbal products marketed for health care, such as diet ary supplements. Recommendations on how to record and re port adverse even ts occu rring dur ing clinica l trial s should be covered by natio nal guidelines on good clini cal practic e for trials on pharmaceutical prod ucts (GCP) (9). 4.3 Reporting of susp ected adv erse reactions Who should report and to whom? The setting (see section 4.2) in which an adverse reaction is noted and the status of the person noting the reaction will determine the most a ppropr iate means of reporting. Although the term \"n ational pharmac ovigilance centre\" has been use d in these guidelines, i t is recognized that i n some countries the national pharmacovigilance syst em consists of a networ k of nationa l and regional centres . Reports should be sent to t he appropriate centre in accordance with th e particular national reporting schem e. The following should provide rep orts. Health profe ssionals who are p rovider s of herbal me dicines , including physicians, pharmacists and nurse s, should report to the national pharmacovigilance centre. Patients/con sumers shoul d normally report to their physicia ns or provi ders of herbal medicines. Th ey may also repo rt direct ly to the national pharmacovigilance centre, consumer organizations or manu facturers. Manufacture rs should report dire ctly to the natio nal pharmacovigilance centre or national regulatory authority. 19 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems What infor mation sho uld be re quested? Any suspected adverse reaction associated with the use o f a herbal medicines should be r eported. A case report shou ld contain information on the following elements: where it is permitted by the country health in formation privacy code, and with appropriate confidentiality, so me form of identification of the patient/consumer in or der to avoid dupli cations and facilit ate follow-up age, sex and a brief medical history of the consumer/patient (when relevant); in some countries, ethnicity may need to be specified details of suspected herbal product(s) if known: species nam e (Latin binomial name and common vernacular na me of medicinal plant) and/or brand or ingredient n ame(s), including the p art of medi cinal plant used, preparation methods; manufacturer, country of or igin, batch number, ex piry date and provider administration details: dose a nd quantity supplied, dosage form, route, start/stop d ates indication or reason for use adverse reaction data: date of onse t (or duratio n from first administration to onset of event), description w ith symptoms and signs, severity and seriousness, results of clinical investig ations an d tests, course and outcome, and dechall enge/rechallenge with t he same product, where appropriate all other m edicines used (including se lf-med ication), with administr ation details risk factors, e.g. age, impaired renal fu nction, previous e xposure to the herbal medicine(s) concerned, previous allergie s, drug misuse or abuse, the social use of drugs name and a ddress of re porter (to be considered confidential and to be used only for data verification, completion and case f ollow-up). Details of the factors to consider when developing a report are provided in Annex 5, to gether with an ex ample of a reporting form. How to repo rt A single reporting for m covering all me dicines, including herbal medicines, should be used. For health-care prov iders already included in a national pharmacovi gilance system, a familiar form will fac ilitate repo rting; the introduction of a second type of reporting form may cause confusion. It is desirable to use a standard printed or el ectronic repo rting form and to ensure that forms are widely available. It should also be acceptable t o recei ve reports by telephone, l etter or e-mail. If possible, a samp le of the he rbal product and its packaging should be submitted with the report. Consideration should be given to the di strib ution of reporting for ms to those invol ved in the provisi on of herbal medi cines, such as providers of traditional medicine and of complementary/alt ernative medicine, who may not pr eviously have been p art of th e national phar macovi gilance system . It may be necessary to design a special repo rting form fo r those not familiar w ith the reporting of suspect reactions to medicines. Educational materials, incl uding a list of simple terminology that can be understood by all partie s, should be developed t o infor m and assist those not familiar with rep orting. 20 Safety monitoring of herbal m edicines Recording a nd coding the identity of herbal medi cines Use of a standardized classification and id entification for transmitting r eports to UMC is desirable. Coding of adverse events/adverse reactions to herbal medicines should be compatible with t hat for other medicines. UMC therefore proposes the use of the WHO Drug Dictionary (WHO-D D) (10), as it has bee n developed to store structured, classified information on the name s of herbal products and their ingredients in the sa me way as similar information on other medicines. For the therapeutic classifica tion of herbal products, UMC proposes the herbal anatomical-therapeutic-chemic al (HATC) cla ssification, which is structurally equi valent to the an atomical-therapeutic-chemical (ATC) classificatio n used for chemical substanc es in other medicines. HATC is being implemented within the WHO-DD structure as part of the global WHO database. A combination of the use of the H ATC cl assification and t he ex pande d global WHO database structure can man age all le vels of data input, however imprecise (Annex 6). In addition, UMC also prop oses a syst em checklist for cross- referencing of botanical names used as names of ingr edients. UMC suggests t hat the WHO-DD, the HATC classification and the checklist should prove useful tools for natio nal pharma covigilance centres whe n asking questions of the reporter to increase the clarity and accuracy o f reports. Herbal medicines usually contain multip le ingredients and it is not always possible to identify the m all. In such ca ses, th e product name should be recorded and referred to UMC, which will assist with identification. If the product is not already in the global W HO database, it w ill be added, together with the available information. A particular herbal produc t may h ave a number of indications and therefore appear in several plac es in the HATC classification. Local input by the reporter as to the prec ision or otherwise of the information on the product is most useful. This can be provided in free tex t, as a commentary on the report, or by the submission of manu facturer's inform ation or the original packaging. A national inventory or catalo gue of medicinal pl ants may al so serve as a referen ce on medicinal plants and their use in the community. In many countries, however, knowledge of medicinal plants and their medicin al use has not been d ocumented. The establishment of a national in ventory or catalogue should therefore be encouraged. If the finish ed herbal product concerned or its raw material s were imported from other count ries, the dru g regulatory authority of the export ing country may be able to provide helpful i nformation. The precise Latin binomial botanical nam e (genus, species, author; as well as name of fa mily) of the medicinal plants concerned should be used whenever possible, together with i nformation about the plant parts used and the extraction and prepa ration met hods empl oyed. This information allows accurate comparison with other reports. A common vernacular name may be used in order not to delay or cancel submis sion of a report. Nation al pharmacovigilance centres sho uld collaborate with the phar macognosy departments of universities and with b otanists, zoologists and botanical garden st aff regarding tax onomic (botanical and chemi cal) identificati on an d botanical and vernacula r nomenclature. 21 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems Further classification systems may need to be specially developed in order to cover additional products used in tr aditional me dicine. Othe r repo rting issues Under no circumstances should informat ion obtained during pharmaco vigilance activities be divu lged for commerci al purp oses. The identit y of both the patient and the reporter shoul d remain confiden tial unless t heir written permission t o reveal this information is obtained ( Annex 3). Reporting on herbal me dicines sho uld be as ac curate and complete as possible. On the othe r hand, that fact tha t information is less th an op timal should not de ter reporting. 4.4 Assessment of case reports Individual case reports Assessmen t of reports on adverse reacti ons to herbal medicines should be undertaken by national pharmacovigilance cent res in th e same way as for other medicines. Each data el ement in the repo rt should be considered and a causality asses smen t made using a sta ndard a pproach. The asse ssme nt is usually based on: the a ssociation in time b etween adm inistration of the herbal product and the event the outcome of dechallenge and rechallenge known pharmacology (includ ing current knowledge of the nature and frequency of adverse reactions) medical or pharmacological plaus ibility (the sequence of symptoms, signs and laboratory tests a nd also pathological findings an d knowledge of mechanisms ) likelihood o f other causes or their excl usion testing for a dulterants or contaminants th at could be the source of adverse events. inappropriate use. The WHO causality categories benefit from long and ex tensive use and have the advantage of being in ternationally agreed and easy to use. The causality categories are listed in Table 1 (1). It is most important to determine whether a r eaction is caused by the way a herbal medicine has been used or p repar ed. Par ticular attention to t hese factors should be given when an adverse reaction is suspected in connection with the use of herbal medicines usually em ployed in a traditional medicine. Misdiagnosis and use outside an establish ed tradition by poorly trained providers and practitioners can be unsafe and may lead to overdose and adverse reactions. A change in the procurem ent sources of herbal materials , misidentification of t he medicinal plant(s ) and/or herbal material(s) used, or a change in the mode of preparation ma y lead to entirely preventable and sometimes serious adverse reactions. This should be taken into account when asses sing in dividual cases. The bes t evid ence should be sought to de termine the established standards of practices. 22 Safety monitoring of herbal m edicines Table 1. Causality categories The causality categories described by the Up psala Monitoring Cen tre 1 Certain: a clinica l even inclu ding ality , occu rring in a plausib le time relationship to drug administration, an d which cannot be exp lained by concurrent disease or other dr ugs or chem icals .

Category C: \"Reports where causal ity is, f or one or anot her reason, not asse ssab le, e.g. becau se of missing or conflicting data\". Feedback to report ers The receipt of each report should be acknowledged and a new repo rting form supplied to the report er. The rep orter wi ll also apprec iate receivin g furthe r information about the reaction concerned, for example, on experience h eld at the national pharmacolovigilance centre or that may be helpful in further use of the medicines, unless the p rovision of such in forma tion is in co nflict with r egulatory policy. S uch feedback will motivate the re porter to send in fu rther report s. Detection of signals at national level The nationa l pharmacovigilance centre sh ould, at regular intervals, analyse the case reports in its database by class of organ s ystem and in smaller groups of clinica lly rel ated events. This may r eveal case s eries of similar events t hat could constitute a signal and/or indicate the need for further study or regulator y action. Such signals sho uld be com municated to UMC. Weak signals may be 23 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems strengthe ned by ex amination of re ports from other countries held in the global WHO database. Detection of signals at internationa l level The major aim of pharmacovigilance is the early detection of signals of previo usly unrecognized adverse reaction s. Ea rly signals may be stre ngthen ed by com bining the experiences reported in various countries. Region al studies may be of particular value in the monito ring of herbal m edicines. Data-minin g techniq ues can be helpful in individual countries, but are most effecti ve in the global WHO database managed by UMC. Use of an ad visory co mmitt ee Each nation al pharmacovigilance cent re should have an advisory committee composed of experts to give advice on: maintaining quality standar ds in dat a collection and as sessment procedures data interpretation publication of information follow-up action require d. The committee should be selected accord ing to the expertise available but it should not be too large, so that it may not be p ossible to h ave all of the relevant disciplines represented. A committee mi ght be selected from the following disciplines: general me dicine, and quality a ssurance, drug in formation, information science, medical anthropology, co mmunications, ethnoph armacology, pharmacognosy, p ive medicin e. Investigatio n and analysis of the ca use of suspected adverse reaction s Some adverse reactions, particu larly seri ous ones should be further investigated scientifically . The investigatio ns may include the following: medical investigation of the advers e reactions: pathology, clinical pharmacology, clinical t oxicology, p harmacogenetic studies pharmaceutical investigation of t he adverse reactions: pharmacokinetics, pharmaco-dynamics an d pharmaceutical pharmacognosical/phytochemical authentification) of the herbal medicines physicochemical analys is to identify the constitu ents of t he herbal medicines pharmacoepidemiology. Technical ex pertise and basic equip ment Where possible, national pharmacovigil ance centres should have the necessary technical ex pertise to ha ndle herbal medicines. This might include: access to reliable inform ation support on herbal medicines trained pe rsonnel in relevant technical areas (e. g. pharma cognosy, phytochemistry, eth nobotany, et hnopharmacology) and in the use and provision of herbal medicines 24 Safety monitoring of herbal m edicines access to fac ilities for analysis of pote ntially causative products about which there is often insufficien t information. Not all countries have access to suitable analytical laboratories. The establishme nt of regional laboratories specia lizing in th e analysis of herbal products should be cons idered. 4.5 D ata managemen t Data quality . Strenuous efforts should be made to ensure that there are quality controls on data proce ssing a nd that t he da ta element s of reports are as complete and accurate as pos sible. Mechanis ms to chec k for duplications should be instituted. Data storage. Computer database s should be ma naged to as high a stand ard as possible to facilitate access to and use of the data. Software should be sel ected with ex pert advice so that an alytical needs ca n be met. Data analysi s. Programmes should be develo ped to provide for re gular analyses and data outp ut appropriate for local needs. Analysis of the global WHO dat abase. The global WHO database manag ed by UMC is being improve d on the basis of the proposed \"Dat abase man agement and classification for coding of herbal medicin es\", of w hich the previously mentioned HATC is one part (An nex 6).

Communication 5.1 General The succes sful safety monitorin g of herba l medicines depends on goo d communication (Annex 2). There ar e many ba rriers to be broken down if all the players in this field are to be involv ed. There is distrust between some and ignorance of the work and fu nction of different g roups. Tra nsparent communication is esse ntial to overcome thes e problems and en sure that all players collaborate to meet the g oal of the safe and ef fective use of herbal medicines. National pharmacovigilance centre s shou ld en sure that m anufacturers receive timely information so that they ca n ta ke appropriate act ion regardi ng their products. Effective com munication of the resu lts of monitoring is also essential so that pharma covigilance activi ties can have a positive impact on the hea lth of the people. If there is no national phar macovigilance centre, consideration should be given to designating other relevant organ izations, su ch as th e national r egulatory authority, poisons centres, drug inform ation centres and c onsumer complaints authorities as the focal point. Communication should be established at many different levels, for e xample, between: the na tional pharmacovigilance professionals the na tional pharmacovigilance centre and providers of herbal medicines health professionals and providers of herbal m edicines, and consumers and patients providers of herbal medicines and t hose for other medicines the na tional pharmacovigilance centre and cons umers the na tional pharmacovigilance cent re and the regulatory aut hority the n ational pharmacovigilance centre and such centres in other countries, within the r egion or in other regions the na tional pharmacovigilance centre and UMC the na tional pharmacovigilanc e centre and the mass m edia. The development of effective comm unicatio n needs to be adequately resourced. It is likely that this mos t important part of the s afety monit oring programme for herbal medicines will re quire pro portionat ely greater resources than is the case for other medicines. 27 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems 5.2 Risk communication Communication strategi es should be estab lishe d to effectively reach all relevant target audiences, such as providers of herbal medicines, othe r health professionals, manufact urers and patients/consumers. Communication of safet y information is a share d responsibility between national pharmacovigilance centres, na tional re gulatory agencies, manufacturers an d health profe ssionals. Dif ferent co mmunication vehicles can be idered, includ ing: adverse reaction bulletin s or articl es distributed in reputable journals public advisories or warnings \"Dear Healt h Profession al\" letters. Various methods of info diss emination c an be consid ered, such as: Internet posting direct mass mailing to provide rs of herb al medicines and he alth professionals briefings to the ma ss me dia briefings to patient/consumer associations education sessions at health professional society meetings. In order to reach consumers and the wide rang e of providers of herbal medicines successfully, message s should be tailore d to suit the recipients, including translation i nto local languages whe re appropriate. 28 References 6.

High scientific, ethical and professional stand ards and a mo ral code should govern this acti vity. The inherent un certainty of the risks a nd benefits of drugs needs to be ackn owledged and ex plained. Decisions and action s tha t are ba sed on t his uncertainty should be informed b y scientific and clinical cons iderations and should take into account social realities and circumstances . Flaws in drug safety communication at all levels of society can lead to mistrust , misinformation and misguided actions re sulting in harm and the creat ion of a climate whe re drug safety data may be hidden, withheld, or ignored. Fact should be distinguished from spec ulation a nd hypothes is, and actions take n should reflect the needs of those affe cted and the care they require. These actions call for systems and legislation, na tionally and internation ally, that e nsure ful l and open e xchange of information, and e ffective standards of evaluation. These standards will ensure th at risks and benefi ts can be assessed, explained and acted upon openly and in a spirit that pr omotes gen eral confidence and trust. The following statements set forth t he basi c requirements for this to happen, and were agreed upon by all participants, from 30 countries at Erice: 1. Drug safety information must serv e the health of the public. Such information should be ethically and effectively commun icated in terms of both content and method. F acts, hypotheses and conclusions should be distinguished, uncertainty acknowledged, and i nformation provided in ways that meet both general and ind ividual needs. 2. Education in the appropriate use of drugs, incl uding interpretation of safety infor mation, is essential for the public a t large, as well as for patients and health-care providers. Such education requires special commitment and resources. Drug info rmation directed to the public in whateve r form should be balanced with respect to risks and benefits. 3. All the evidence neede d to asse ss and underst and risks a nd benefits must be openly available. Const raints on communication parties, which hinder their ability to meet wi th this goal, must be recognized and overcome. 4. Every count ry needs a system with independent expertise to ensure that s afety i nformation on all ava ilable drugs is adequately collected, impartially evaluated, and made accessible to all. Adequate nonpartisan financing must be a vailable to support the system. Exchange of data a nd evaluation among countries must be encouraged and supported. 37 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems 5. A strong basis for drug safety mon itoring has been laid over a long period, although somet imes in res ponse to di sasters. Inn ovation in this field now needs to ensure t hat emergent problems are promptly recognized and efficiently dealt with, and that information and solutions are effectively communicated. These ideal s are achievable and the participants at the conference commit themselves accordingly. Details of what might be done to give effect to this declaration have been considered at the co nference and form the substance of the conference report. Erice September 29, 19 97 38 Annex 3 Annex 3: Privacy and th e confidentiality of personal health data2 Legislation or rules recently enacted or in progress in the E U, US and elsewhere in many countries have introduced new data subject rights and t he need fo r strong safeguards in t he collectio n, pr ocessing and trans fer (especially across country bo rders) of personally identi fiable data handled via any media, electronic or physical (pap er, film, etc.). It ha s particular relevance to health information, among the more sensitive types of data, and certainly applies to adverse events reports, which often include data that directly identify the subject and/or the reporter with name , address, national health number, or o ther overt identifiers. Within some legal syst ems, indirect information that might allow determination of an individual's identity mu st also be protected (i.e. reference to one or more factors specific to a pers on's physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or other characteristic s that could facilitate determi nation of his/her iden tity). Although current practices throughout the pharmaceutical industry and by regulatory authorities re flect a commitmen t to protection of personal data, new laws in m any countries neces sitate some cha nges in personal-data handling practices. I ncreased rights for data su bjects include not ification on who is processing their data, for what purp ose, and wit h whom the data may b e shared, as well as the ability to access their own data and make correction s. Under appropriate circumstan ces, this m ay require enha ncem ent of t he ordinary informed consent process for activities, such as clinical trials. The use o f secondary d atabase s, so important t o pharmacoepidemiology and retros pective studies in ge neral, may a lso be affected. There is no intention to cove r this co mpli cated topic her e in more detail and those working in pharmacovigilance, and clin ical research generally, should familiarize themselves with applic able data protection laws and regulations. However, it is important to explain that the ter m \"identifiability\" does not have the same m eaning under one of the CIOMS V topics, \"Assessing P atient and Report Idntifiabi lity\", as it does within the context of data protec tion legal regimes. Fo r adverse e vent reportin g, an id entifiable patient of reporter relates to the ex istence of a real person that can be verified/vaiadated in some way. Under data protection schemes, the term refers to an ab ility to assoc iate a data set with a particular person (\"trace\" a pers on from the data available). 2 Reproduced, by permission, from Current challen ges in phar macovigilance : pra gmatic approach. Re port of CIOMS Working Group V. Geneva, The Co unci l for International Orga nizations of Medi cal Sciences, 2001. 39 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems 40 Annex 4 Annex 4: Spont aneous report s from persons other than health-care professio nals3 The CIOMS Working g roup p roposes several policy app roaches and practices which aim to ensure that consumer repo rts are treated with appropriate respect and th at the re is a rational approach for handling them. In general, because the treating hea lthcare professionals remain vital partners in understanding and managing treatment emergent a dverse events, t heir involvement in th e confirmation process s hould take place whenever possible. Because much time and effort are ex pended on the managem ent of consumer reports, international alignment of ex pectations regarding th e handling of consumer-cases is also needed to assure proper focus on effo rts likely to add public health value. Therefore the following principles and practices are recommended: Definition of medical confirmation A situation in which a healthcare professi onal, preferably one directly involved in the care of the p atient (primary heal thcare provider), confirms (i.e., agrees) that the circumstances a s reported by or on be half of the patient occurred and that the f acts, as amended or updated in the co nfirmation process, constitute an adverse eve nt case for which there is a su spicion by that healthcare professional of drug caus ality (thus, it should be considered an adverse drug reaction). The importa nt point in t his context i s to distinguish between verification of the facts by the healthcare p rofessional (things did o r did not ha ppen as de scribed by the patient) and the professional's confir mation that a drug-related adverse event (i.e., an adverse drug reaction) occurred. General policy issues Consumers should be encouraged to report personal adverse experiences to healthcare providers, but primarily to their t reating phy sician. Com panies and regulators should convey this messag e through educational materials or in the course of responding to consumer inqui ries or com plaints. Consumer advocacy groups and disease- specific pa tient su pport groups should also be encouraged to foster this prac tice among their constituents. Neither a company no r a regulator shou ld refer a consumer/patient to a specific healthcare professional. Physicians and other healthcare prof essionals, as part of any me dical education, should be sensitized to the im portance of listening to t heir patients for circumstances which might constitute a reportable adverse drug reaction. When reports about con sumers are receiv ed from a third party who is not a healthcare professional (e.g., a relative or other patient advocate, traditional healer, lawyer), that party should be encourage d to have the patient contact his/her physician and request that the ph ysician report the case, if appropriate, or alternatively (or in addition) to encourage the consumer to authorize the sponsor/authority to contact the doctor directly. 3 Reproduced, by permission, from Current challen ges in phar macovigilance : pra gmatic approach. Re port of CIOMS Working Group V. Geneva, The Co unci l for International Orga nizations of Medi cal Sciences, 2001. 41 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems Case managemen t practices for companies and regulators: Regarding all repo rts directly from consumers or from their non-health care- professional representati ves: During all contacts, attempts s hould be m ade to obtain information sufficient to ascertain the nature and seriousness of the complaint. Base d upon this understanding, the stra tegy for documentation and follow-up will be deter mined (see below). Permission should be sought to cont act the consumer's primary healthcare provider in order to obt ain additional medical d etails when relevant; such permission should be documented. If the patient prefers to obtain and forward sup porting/con firmatory medica l recor ds, attempts should still be made to obt ain physician-contact pe rmission. All such reports should be documented as for a ny other typ es of case s and should be taken into consideration when overall safety assessme nts are conducted. As with the handling of all other indivi dual case reports, patient-spe cific information (personal data) should be treated confidentially4. Identification of the case should be suffic ient to permit re call and cro ss- linkage with any subsequently ob tained medical inform ation, with all requisite steps to as sure prot ection of patient privacy. In addition to these general pract ices, some special cons iderations apply that depend on the perceived serious or non-serious nature of the case. The information provided in the initial co nsumer report wi ll usual ly permit a judgement a s to whet her the case is \"appa rently\" serious or on-serious; this may be the only judgement possible in the a bsence of subseq uent medical confirmations. When and already labeled/ex pected: No additional effort (follow-up or medi cal confirmation) is required by the company or regulatory recipient as long as the minimum criteria for a case are satisfied5. When the event is apparently seriou s, or is non-serious unla beled/ unexpected: Special effo rt should be made to obtain permission to contact the consumer's physician. I f the patient re fuses, a ttempts s hould be made to encourage the consume r to provide re levant medical records on his /her own. If permission is obtained to cont act the p atient's phy sician or other healthcare professional, who in turn is unwil ling to respond to company 4 See Annex 3, Priv acy and the conf ident iality of personal health data. 5 An ident ifiable rep orter; an id entifiable patient; a reaction/ev ent; a suspected medicin al product. 42 Annex 4 attempts at follow-up for confirmation, it is possi ble that reg ulators in so me countries m ay be in a better position to obtain the requisite follow- up or confirmatory data. Even in th e absence of medical confirmation, an y re port containing suspected adverse drug reaction s wi th possible imp lications for the medicine's benefit-risk relationship sh ould be submitted to regulators on an ex pedited and/or periodic basis. Although the US and Canadian regu latory authorities appear to be the only ones currently re quiring s ubmission of consum er reports, consideration should be given to submitting such important cases to regulators. Considerations on perio dic safety reporting To satisfy current European, Jap an and ot her countries' req uirements, medically unconfirmed consumer reports shoul d not be ro utinely incl uded in official international su mmary reports, such as ICH Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs). It should be recognized, ho wever, that others (such as the US and Can adian regulators) may require that a listing or summary of such reports be provided as an appendix to a PSUR. Nevertheless, all consu mer reports regard ed as adverse drug reactions should be regularly scrutinized for new \"signals\" or to confirm or extend the safety experience derived f rom all other s ource s. A statemen t sho uld be made in the PSUR that s uch unconfirmed reports hav e been reviewed and either add no important n ew informat ion or, conversely, suggest new find ings. It is possible that unconfirmed cons umer reports cou ld contrib ute new, important information; if so, a s eparate tabulation and co mment with in th e formal PSUR should be included. 43 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems 44 Annex 5 Annex 5: Model reporting form General consider ations The reporti ng form for herbal medicines shou ld be the same as that used for other medicines. Countries s hould modify their national report ing forms to facilitate the reporting of suspect reactions to herbal medicines or intera ctions between herbal medicines and other medicines. Only basic and important information should be requested. A request for great detail will result i n fewer reports. The form sh ould have a simple format. The form sh ould look simple; a desi gn with plenty of \"whit e space\" is helpful. The form should be designed in such a way that it is self-evident how it should b e filled in. Any instructi ons for us e should be simple; detailed instructi ons may discourage those with little training. Simpli city will enco urage the r ecording of the best information available in the circumstances. The form should incl ude instructi ons on how it should be completed and where it should be sent (i.e. a retu rn address). The use of reporting forms should be seen as a screening process designed to reveal evidence of problems that need further inve stigation. The information suppl ied shoul d be perfectly adeq uate, in most cas es, to pe rmit adequate identification and evaluation of a proble m. Follow-up f orms should be availab le for us e when further details are required. These should be designed for use by district investigation teams or hospitals. Several typ es of foll ow-up fo rms may be ne eded for th e investigation of spec ific problems, e.g. liver toxi city, death, inefficacy. Accurate identification of the patient/cons umer is importa nt follo w-up avoid duplication. Essentia l info rmation includes: name (or unique health facility num ber), date of birth (if unk nown, then approximate age) and sex.

This has mainly invol ved the structure of information held in the substanc e register of the WHO Drug Dictionary (WHO-DD). The register identifies the \"preferred names\" o f ingredients of products mentioned on all ADR r eports in the global WHO database. The l ogic for identifying \"preferred names \" for herbal subst ances follows, as far a s possible, that for identifying preferred ch emical substance nam es in the WHO-DD. The validity of any scie ntific name (botanical names) t hat may be used as a \"preferred name\" for herbal products is problematic, since such n ames may be revised during taxonomic review. It is important to stress that the use of va lid Latin binomial (scientific) names in the substance register of the WH O-DD is not for the purpos e of providing a botanical reference work. They are the nam es that UMC has decided to use in order to provide uniq ue names for herbal ingredients equivalent to international non-proprietary names (INN) for che mical ingre dients in th e global WHO database. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, United Kingdom, has collaborated in ensurin g that the se names represent unique species. If there are other scientific names, they are regarded as synonym s. The scientific names comprise the Latin binomial (a genus nam e and a spe cies epithet), the name of t he author who described the specif ic sp ecies, and the publ icatio n source. To determine which botanical name s were syno nyms, a nd to find furth er information on each medicinal plant, its major chem ical cons tituents/entities and medical uses, the major reference publications that UMC considers re levant were ex amined. For information on ingredients of reported herbal products, a va riety of sources was con sulted, including the scientific li terature, summaries of produc t characteristics (SPCs ) from na tiona l pharmacovigilance centres, and dire ct input from national pharmacovigilance centres. In addition t o the preferred name, t he list of ingredients should identify which part of the plant is used and give an indication of how the \"active substances\" h ave been extracted. This provid es a more complete id entificati on of the \"acti ve herbal ingredient\". For conventional drugs, all preferred na mes of sing le ingredient medicines are either bas es or salts. For all salts there must be a link to a ba se, e.g. omeprazole sodium is linked to omeprazole. Herbal products are treated in a similar way, in that the \"mother h erbs\" (medicinal plants) will be the equivalent of bases and the different plant parts (herba l materials) a nd/or types of ex tract/herbal preparations ar e equivalent to the salts. As shown in the herbal substance data links (F ig. 1), the he rbal ingredients given as valid scientific names of medi cinal plants are linke d to common n ames of the plants and also to plant parts and t he extracts or other herbal preparations used. S o when ret rieving information about a specified medicinal plant, st arting from any scientific botanical name, vernacula r, or common name, it will be eas y to find all related substances (chemica l 47 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems entities) including those where different part s/herbal materials and/or ex tracts or other herbal preparations are specified, and vice versa. Herbal anatomical-ther apeu tic-chemical classification The herbal anatomical-therapeutic-chemical cl assification (HATC) is a classification primarily based on those herbal products that have adverse drug reactio ns reported in the global WHO database and therefo re appear in the WHO-DD. They are not nec essarily categorized in a medicines category in any pa rticular country. The H ATC classifi cation, unlike the regular ATC system, is based on botani cal science, pharmacognosy, phytochemistry, literature search an d docume traditional r than ch emistry and me dicine. It is linked to botanical syno nyms and v ernacular n ames via the substance register of the WHO-DD, which contains all ingredients, herb al and chemical, of medicinal products mentioned on reports in the global W HO database. In addition to the ident ification by pref erred name a nd in formation on the plant parts used and methods of preparation, the HATC classification as used in the global WHO database, indicates: the suggest ed anatomica l site of pharmaceutical action the range of intended me dical uses in cluding traditional therapeutic uses. The HATC classificatio n is mainly used as an administrative tool for placing gro ups o f herbal products in the coding syste ms, and to group-related products in signal wo rk and other congregated se arches The storage and m anagement of safety monitoring information on herbal medicines Principle s of the syst em It is often i mpossible to obtain information on both the tr aditional product composition and the use of such products by patients. No data manage ment system c an capture more than is kno wn, but the combination of the HA TC classification and the current global WHO database structure allows any and all information to be entered. The basic philosophy behind the d ata ma nage ment of her bal products and tradit ional medicines is to achieve a system t hat is capabl e of handling all levels of information, at the same time b eing utterly transparent to users over any impre cision, missing dat a and the links that are built into the hierarchies in the system. Pre cision versus uncertainty, for example, can be considered as occurring along several ax es: identification of the med icinal plant itemization of the medic inal plant pa rt (herbal material) stipulation of preparation method s (processing including ext raction procedures) definition of the major chem ical constituents ext racted definition of the major ingredients/ herbal materials (name and pr oport ion) in mixt ure herbal products (complex preparations and products) note of any variations in product composition (and dosage f orm) intended medical use, indicating diseas es or sy mptoms that can be treated. 48 Annex 6 Detailed descriptions of the HATC classificati on and the global WHO database syste m are available from UMC. Adverse drug reaction terms, and i ndications, used in ADR reports o n herbal product s and traditi onal medicines will often be those recommended for other medicines. However, additions to WHO-ART and MedDRA may be needed to capture differences in expressing ADRs cause d by the use of herbal pr oducts, especially in the case of traditional medicines, in accordance with pa rticular treatment conc epts and/o Yin\" are poss ible states o f diseases within the Chinese medicine system, a concept unique t o this part icular type of medicine. Such details will be added to W HO-ART, as required. It is clear t hat oth er syst ems can be devised to a ccomplish t he same ends. The purpose of the data manageme nt system described above is specifically for pharmacovigilance, and is specially designed to allow its use alongs ide pharmacovigilance activities for other medicines. This is an i mportant consideration in view of the increasing likelihood that patients/consumers may use both forms of treatment concurrently. Other system s developed and used for pharmacovigilance should function in a similar way and it s hould be possible to link the m with the global WHO database , to ensure t hat all inter nationa l data are poo led for global benefit. Data analysis The new structure and c lassificati on of herbal substances (e ntities) withi n the global WHO database will facil itate finding information ab out finished herbal prod ucts containing a specified m edicinal plant or just a s pecific part , herbal materials, or ex tract or other herba l preparation of the spe cified medicinal plant. This is cruc ial in finding and eval uating signals concerning herbal me dicines and tradit ional medicines (more complex than for other medicines), a s the following example show s. A com pany has fo r years produced a product cont aining Senn a alex andr ina Miller, which in t he labe lling is called \"Cassia\". Anot her company ma rkets a prod uct that also lists \"Cassia\"' as active ingr edient but the product is derived from Senn a armata Wats, a diffe rent botanic al spec ies. Th en reports o f serious AD Rs associated with \"Cassia\" appear and t hey are so s erious t hat a withdraw al from the m arket is consider ed. It may be that only Senn a armata Wats is causing these problem s. In this case the other specie s, Senn a alexandr ina Miller , risks being wrong ly acc used because there is no d istinction bet ween the labe lled name s: \"Cassia\" is the suspected c ause. While the use of the global WHO database and, in particular, the proposed HAT C classification does not solve th e problem of m issing or inac curate info rmation, it is hoped that it will facilitate pr oper c lassification of al l herbal p roduct info rmation and, most importantly, show where there is a po tential for confusion an d/or error. Another linked benefit is that it wi ll be po ssible to produce a checklist of common and vernacula r names covering several different languages, which will be valuable f or all those seeki ng to identi fy the cont ents of herbal remedies used natio nally. It may als o prove useful at poisons centres and probab ly also for pharmaceutical compa nies in labelling th eir herbal products. In the end all involved w ith herbal pr oducts should us e the valid scientific names, to avoid any confusion. 49 WHO g uidelin es on safety monitoring of he rbal m edicines in pharm acovigilance sy stems The data-mining ional data wi ll be partic ularly val uable in trying to find useful patterns within such a large volume of heterogene ous data. M uch consideration will need to be given to the development of such tools and to the u se of international expertise i n the interpretation of information. As always, epidemiolo gical studies, where they can be undertaken, will aid the quantifi cation and validation of early signals. However, epidemiological studies on herbal products are difficult because of the problems of ascertaining precise information. Fig. 1.

The hist ory of int ernational pharm acovigilance go es back as much as thirty years, when the twenti eth Worl d Heal th Assembl y adopted a resoluti on to sta rt a project on the f easibility of an internation al system o f monitoring adve rse re actions to drug s. Th is reso lution was the b asis of WHO's Programme on Internation al Drug Mon itoring. At this moment more t han fi fty count ries p articipate in t his Prog ramme. The world of today n o longer is as it was at the time t he Progr amme was establish ed. New developme nts chal lenge attenti on, req uire adequate rea ction, a nd ra ise new questio ns in adver se drug re action monitoring. A few exam ples may illustrate this: The cu rrent financi al climate force s national authorities to find w ays to contain the c ost of ph armaceutical c are. In some co untries a stron g tendency to self- medication can be seen, and many pharmaceuticals that used to be on prescription only are now available over the counter. The question a rises: Do es this h ave con sequences fo r the safety o f the patients? Tradit iona l medicat ion is incre asing in the We stern world, but the use of herbal medic ines risks escap ing con trol. Nonet heless several herbal medicines are quite act ive, and may be associated with adve rse effects. Continuing vigilance is neede d. A phenomen on t hat has received the attention it deserves , in only the last few ye ars, is the preva lence of counterf eit drugs on the ma rket. Instances of c alamities, claiming the lives of numerous ch ildren due to the use o f a toxic so lvent have been d ocumented. Drug mon itoring progra mmes may well be instrument al in detecting such prod ucts. The way drugs are b eing monitored h as chan ged, both internationally as wel l as on the nat ional level. The WHO Progra mme was establ ished wi th ten cou ntries, all of them highly developed. Gradually more count ries showed interest and even tually joine d the Progr amme, once they fe lt that their n ational systems were s ufficiently deve lope d. Criteria for this devel opment a re not only the functi oning o f the centre in question it self, but also the presence of an e ffective dru g reg ulatory body in t he coun try that has the will and the potenti al to rea ct to signals ema nating from the centre and to ta ke proper regula tory mea sures. WHO cons iders t his poin t as vit al: a pharm acovigilance s ystem mus t be backed up by the regu latory bo dy. In particular the last five years hav e seen an increasing number o f countrie s expressin g the wish to part icipate in the Pro gramme, and severa l countries are in con tact with WHO and t he WHO Collaborating Centre, t he Up psala Monitoring C entre in Sw eden , to receive support with the devel count ries already participate; new count ries now ar e all coming from t he deve lopin g worl d. In severa l cases new count ries hav e requested WHO's collaboration and assistance in setting up a monitoring system. At nat ional level also many ch anges have bee n taking place. In the origin al mo del a pharmacov igilance system is strong ly centra lised, and consists of one nation al centre collecting reports f rom health prof essionals in the country. Many countries, however, no w prefer a more 1decent ralised syst em, with a national centre funct ioning as a focal point for some regional or local centres. Sever al countries are in the proc ess o f starting thei r systems ( conforming to thi s model ), and countri es wi th a long- standing experi ence in drug m onitoring are changing their programmes into a decentralised organisation. Both situations are simi lar in many aspects. Monitorin g Centres alw ays start on a ver y small sc ale, often wi th onl y one enthusi astic (part-time) profession al. These pionee rs in their field need he lp and g uidance. There is a need to provide such eme rging centres wit h some infor mation: the material and reso urces require d, how to operate what kin d of support is ne eded where to f ind adequate literature source s what kind of assistance c an be expected wha t is the rel ationshi p to be sought wi th drug informat ion cent res and po ison inform ation systems, and so on. WHO ha s reacted to this percei ved need by hol ding a cons ultative meet ing that was asked to share exper ience and com petence through discussion of a draft g uidelin e, prep ared by D r Ronald Meyboom. O n the basis o f this disc ussion this do cument has been produced, t hat is intended to be used by new monitoring centres, in order to prev ent them fro m losing time and mon ey as a consequence of the lack of exper ience. It discusse s pr actic al aspects of how to r un a pharmacov igilance centre at the technic al level, with down-to-eart h recommendations. We hope that this gu ideline book let helps pe ople on t he way t o a well -organised and we ll-run pharmacov igilance centre . This Guide line booklet is based on the proceedings of a Cons ultation on Sett ing up and Running of a Phar macovigilance Centre, Wor ld Health Organization, Geneva, 26-27 June 1996.

WHY PHARMACOVIGI LANCE? The in format ion co llected during the pre-mar keting pha se of a me drug is ably incompl ete wi th rega to possi adverse reaction s (for defin ition see Glo ssary): tests in animals are insufficiently pr edict ive of hum an safety in clinical trials patients are selected and limited in number, t he conditions of use differ from those in c linical pract ice and the du ration of trials is limited inform ation about r are but serious adve rse reactions, chron ic tox icity, use in special gro ups (such as children, the elderly or pregnant w omen) or drug interactions is often incomplete or not available. Pharm acovig ilance is needed in every country, because there are differences b etween count ries (and even r egions within countries) in the occurrenc e of adver se drug reaction s and other d rug- related probl ems. Thi s may be bec ause of difference s in: drug product ion distrib ution and us e (e.g. indicat ions, dose, avail ability) geneti cs, di et, tra ditions of the peopl e utical loca lly produced pharmac eutical products the use of n on-orthodox d rugs (e.g. herbal re medies) which ma y pose specia l toxicological problems, wh en us ed alone or in combin ation w ith other dr ugs. Data deri ved f rom within the country or regi on may have greater relev ance and educational value and may encour age national regulatory decision-making. Information ob tained in a cer tain country (e.g. the country of origin of the drug) may not be re levant to other p arts of the w orld, where circ umstances m ay be d ifferent . When information from a regi on itself is not a vailabl e, it may t ake longer be fore a problem bec omes known to drug regulatory authorities, phy sicians, pharmacists, patients and p harmaceutical companies. On the other hand, intern ational monit oring su ch ation o n possib le safety issues which ma y not yet have eme rged within the country's da ta. Pha rmacovigilanc e is needed for t he prevention of drug-induce d human suffering and to avoid fin ancial risks asso ciated w ith unexpected adverse e ffect s. In conclusion, medicin es on the mar ket nee d continuo us monitoring in every co untry. 32. DEFINITI ON AND AIMS Pharm acovig ilance is con cerned with the detect ion, assessmen t and prevention of adverse react ions to drugs. Major aims of p harmacovigilance are: 1. Early detecti on of hitherto unknown adverse rea ctions a nd interacti ons 2. Detection of increas es in fr equen cy of (known) advers e reactions 3. Ident ification of risk factors and possible mechan isms und erlying adverse reactions 4. Estimation of qua ntitative aspects of benef it/risk a nalysis and di ssemi nation of inform ation n eeded t o improve dru g prescribin g and r egulation. The ult imate goals o f pharmacovig ilance are: the ration al and safe use of medic al drugs the assessme nt and comm unic ation o f the risks and benefits o f drugs on the m arket educ ating and informing of patients. Spont aneo us reporting - a re gion al or country-w ide system for the repor ting of susp ected adverse drug react ions - is the primary method in pharmacov igilance. In addit ion, other methods of data-collection exist or are under dev elopment ( see \u00a7 8.5 a nd 10) . 3. HOW TO START A PH ARM ACOVIGILANCE CENTRE A new pharmacovigilanc e centre can start oper ating very quickly. The de velopment of a pharmacovigilance sy stem, howev er, from the first and uncertain st age to becoming an established and effective organisation, is a pr ocess tha t needs time , vision, dedication, e xpertise and cont inuity. The most promisin g location for a new pharm acovigilance centre ma y depend on the orga nisation a nd development of the heal thcare system i n the country and other l ocal issues. A gov ernme ntal department (he alth authority, dr ug regulator y agency) can be a good host for a pharmacov igilance centre. However , any dep hosp ital env working in clinical pha , clinical pha rmacy, clinical toxicology or epid emiolog y, may be a suitable starting p oint for pharmacovigilance. The reporting o f adverse drug r eactions may start locally, perh aps in one hos pital, then ext end to other hospit als and fam ily pr actices in t he region, and p rogress step by step into a national activity. In some countr ies profe ssional bodie s such as the nat ional medical association may be a good hom e for t he cent re. When the centre is a country- wide orga nisation from the start, it shoul d be remembered tha t much e ffort, espec ially in effective communica tions, will be needed before a subst antial proportion of practitioners are contributing. When a cent re is p art of a larger org anisation ( for exam ple, a p administ rative cont inuit y, it can get goin g as long as there is one p rofession al (e.g. a physician or pharmacist) available wh o is prima rily responsible for pharmacovigilance. Whatever th e location o f the centre, pharmacov igilance is cl osely linked to dru g regul ation. Governmental support is neede d and p ublic r elations are needed for a coherent de velopment and for the prevention of unnece ssary competition or dupl ication. 4 3.1 Basic st in setti ng up a Pharm acovigilance Centre Prepar e a p lan ac cordin g to the points below for t he establish ment of the pharmacov igilance system. 1. Make conta cts with the hea lth authori ties and wi th local, region al or n ational institutions and g roups , working in c icine, pharm acology and t oxicolog y, outlinin g the importance o f the project and its p urpose. 2. Design a rep orting form (see \u00a7 4.1) and start collecting d ata by distributing it to hosp ital departments, family pract itioners, etc. 3. Produce pri nted ma terial to inform hea lth professionals about defin itions, aims and methods of th e pharm acovigilance Crea te the datab ase m anagement capability, bibliogra phy, etc. 5. Take c are of the educ ation of pharmaco vigilance staff with r ection a nd verif g of adverse re action descr iptions coding o f drugs case causality assessment signal detection risk ma nagement. 6. Establish a database (administ rative system fo r the stora ge and retri eval of da ta; see also \u00a7 7.1). 7. Organ ise me etings in hos pitals, academia and pro fession al associations, exp laining the principles and dema nds of pha rmacovigila nce and th e importance of reportin g. 8. Promote the importance o f reporting advers e drug reaction s through medic al journ als, other p rofessional publications an d com munic ations activities. 9. Maintain con tacts with international institutions wor king in phar macovig ilance, e.g . the WHO Dep artment of Essential Drugs and Me dicines Policy (Geneva), and the Uppsala Monitorin g Centre, Sw eden (see page 17 for all contact detai ls). 4. REPORTING OF AD VERSE DRUG REACTIONS Spontaneous reportin g - a region al or country- wide system for the repor ting o f suspected advers e drug react ions - is current ly the major so urce of in form ation in ph armac ovigilance. 4.1 Reporting form A case report in pharmaco vigilanc e can be defined as: A not ificat ion re lating to a pat ient with an a dverse medica l eve nt (or labo rator y test a bnormality) suspect ed to be induc ed by a medic ine. A case r eport should (as a mini mum to aim at) cont ain info rmation on t he follow ing elements: 1. The patient: age, sex and brief medic al history (wh en relev ant). I n some count ries ethnic origin may need t o be specified. 2. Adverse eve nt: description (natur e, localisa lts of investig ation s and tests, start d ate, co urse and o utcome. 3. Suspected dru g(s): name ( brand or ingred ient name + dose, ro ute, start/stop d ates, in dication for use (with part icular drug s, e.g. vaccines, a batc h number is import ant). 4. All other drugs used (including self-me dication ): nam es, do ses, routes, st art/stop dates . 55. Risk factors (e.g. impa ired rena l funct ion, previous exposure to suspected dr ug, previous allergies, social drug use). 6. Name and address o f reporter (to be co nsider ed con fidential and t o be use d only for data verificat ion, c ompletion and case follow-up). Report ing should be as easy and cheap as possible. Special free-p ost or business reply reporting forms, containing questio ns 1-6 menti oned a bove, ca n be di stributed ta rget a rea to healt hcare profess ionals at regular intervals (for example, four times a year). It may take the year ly distribution o f hundred s of thousa nds of f orms to harvest onl y some hundred s of case reports. It may be effective to include reply-paid reporting for ms in the national form ulary, drug b ulletin and p rofessional journ als. A lso te leph one, fax and electron ic m ail or internet may be ea sy me ans of report ing where r eliable technolog y is available and acce ssible. 4.2 Reporting by whom ? Profe ssion als working in healthcare are the preferre d source of info rmat ion in pharmacov igilance, for ex ample family pr actitioners, medic ialists and ph armacists. Dentists , midw ives, nurses and other he alth worker s may also administer or prescrib e drugs and sho uld rep ort relev ant experience s. In ad dition pharmacists and nu rses can play an important role in the stimulation of reporting and in the provision of additional information (for exam ple, on co -medication an d previous drug use). Pharm aceutical man ufacturers, bein g primar ily responsible for t he safety of their prod ucts, have to ensure tha t suspected adverse reacti ons to their products are reported to the com petent authority. If adverse re actions are r eported direct ly by patients to the na tional or local centre, i t is useful to consi der the possi or additiona l inform ation and dat a verification. 4.3 What to report? In the early stages of any pharmacovigilance system, reports on all suspected adverse reactions - known or n ot, serious o r not - are welcome and useful, bec ause it is ne cessary to cr eate a notification culture in wh ich the inst inctive response to any su spec ted adverse drug re action is to report it. Healthc are pro fession als nee d to learn how a nd wha t to noti fy, and the staff of the pharmacov igilance centre need to g ain experience in assessment, ng and interpreta tion. In est ablished pharm acovigilance systems it is com mon pract ice to request the report ing of all suspected r eactions, inc luding minor on es for ne w drugs. For e stablishe d drugs the reporting of serio us or unusual suspected adver se reactions is of particular importance, wh ereas known and minor re actio ns are o f less intere st. (Se e Glossary for the de finition of a serio us reaction .) If an incre ased frequenc y of a given re action is suspect ed this is also a reason for reporting. Although pharmacov igilance i s primar ily concer ned wi th pha rmaceutical medicines (including radiolog ic co ntrast media, vaccines and di agno stics), adverse reactions associated wit h drugs used in traditional med icine (e.g . herb al reme dies) shoul d also be considere d. Speci al fields of interest are d rug ab use and drug use in pregnan cy (teratogen icity uspected p harmaceutical de fects is recommende d, especially when t here is the poss ibility of manufacturing pro blems, count erfeit pharmaceuticals or of the dev elopment of resistance (e.g. antibiotics). Pharmacovigilance and 6 poison cont rol are c losely relat ed activities, sinc e the probl ems encountered with accidenta l or intenti onal overdose m ay cast doubt on the sa fety of a medi cal drug. Also adverse reaction s to c osmetics m ay need to be reported, espe cially when cosmetics cont ain obsolet e or toxic ingr edient s (e.g. merc ury compounds or cort icoids in ble aching creams ). If t here is no other organisation in the country dealing with t he issue s, a pharmacov igilance centre may also cover problems r elated to med ical devices and equipment, although di fferent expertise may be needed . The reportin g of adverse events occurring d uring cl inical tria ls are not covered by these guidelines. Recommend ations on how to reco rd and report such ev ents are inc luded in guidelines on good c linical pract ice for trials on pha rmaceut ical product s (GCP). 4.4 Mandator y or voluntary reporting? In many cou ntries t he reporting of adverse drug react ions is volunt ary, but in an incr easing number of c ountries some legal reporting obli gations on hea lthcare pro fessionals have been established (although a penalty is not usually associated wit h failure to report ). Little inform ation is av ailable regard ing t he advantages an d dis advantages of such o bligations. In add ition, in m any count ries it is mand atory fo r ph armaceutical companies to report suspected adverse drug reactions to t he heal th aut horities. 5. SPECI AL ISSUES IN REPO RTING 5.1 Central or decentralised re porting ? As a rule sp ontaneous m onitoring aims at count ry-wi de rep orting and t he use o f one c entral pharmacovigilance da tabase to obta in a national overview. The collect ion of d ata may nevert heles s be more s uccessful in n umber and quality if rep orting i s organised re gionally, especially wh en countrie s are large or have re gional cultural d ifferences. Regional c entres with short li nes of communi cation to hea lthcare professionals ma y improve communic ations and feedb ack. W hen region al centres are used, good coll aboration and dat a-exchange w ith the national cent re needs t o be ensur ed. Region alisation requ ires more st aff and facilities and can therefore be more expensive. 5.2 Stimulati on of reporting The report ing of adverse react ions nee ds cont inuous stimulation. It is import ant to achieve the devel opment of a posi tive a ttitude towa rds ph armacovigilanc e among healthcare pro fessionals so that adverse reaction reporting b ecomes an accep ted and und erstood ro utine. In sum mary, the following may stimulate reporting: easy access to pre-paid reporting forms and ot her means o f reporting acknow ledg ing the rece ipt of adverse drug re action reports by personal letter or phone call providing feedback to re porters in the form o f articles in journ als, adver se drug reactio n bullet ins or newslet ters participation of the cent res staff in pre - and post graduate education and scientific meet ings collaborat ion with local drug or pharm acovigi lance commit tees collaboration with professional associ ations integration o f pharm acovigilance in t he (further) development of clinical pharmac y and clinical pharmacolog y in a country. 75.3 Under-re porting Under-reporting is a com mon phen omenon in all countries. Cor recting for u nder-report ing is difficult, how ever, bec ause its ext ent is unknown and very v ariable. Even at establish ed cen tres the reported proportion of serio us react ions m ay not be more than 10%. Several o f the co untries particip ating for m any y ears in the WHO Dr ug Monitorin g Programme receive 200 or more adverse react ions per m illion inh abitant s annually from abo ut 10% of physicians. In man y other countri es, however, the reporti ng rates are much lower. Under-reporting may delay sign al dete ction and c ause unde restimation of t he size of a problem. However, in signal detection not onl y the qua ntity but also the r elevance of c ase reports and the quality of data are important. There are also a number of more elusive issue s which re quire attention. Som etimes hea lthcare profession als fear that the acknow ledgement of ad verse re actions may re flect negative ly on t heir competence or put them a t risk of litigation. Som e are reluctant to report a dverse rea ctions because of doubts regarding the causal role of the drug (although, of course, it is essential that suspect ed reactions ar e rep orted). Un der-report ing is both a technical and a psy chologic al issue. Clarity of cr iteria for r eporting, s imple p rocedu res and good motivational practice are all influent ial in addre ssing the problem. 6. PRACTICALITIES IN THE ORGANI SATION OF A PHARMACOVIGI LANCE CENTRE 6.1 Staff The expertise desirab le in the routine s of a ph armacovigilance centre i ncludes (see al so \u00a7 7) : clinical med icine pharmacology toxicology, and epidemio logy . However, a new pharm acovigilanc e centre often st arts wi th only a pa rt-time expert - usua lly a physician or a pharmacist - and som e secretarial support. It may soon b ecome necess ary t o have one expert who is responsible fo r phar macovig ilance for most of his/her time and fo r secret arial assistance t o be exp anded (see \u00a7 6.3, Continuity). When the r eporting re actions incre ases, staff reso urce requirem ents may be calculated by assum ing that the average assessment time per c ase report is abo ut one ho ur. 6.2 Useful e quipm ent (includes): elephone wo rd processor ) printer (comp uter li nked) fax e-mail photocopier. 8 6.3 Continuity Cont inuit y in acces sibility and se rvice is a bas ic feature of a succ essful pha rmacovigilance centre. The centre t herefore nee ds a perm anent secret ariat, for phone calls, mai l, maintena nce of the database, literature doc ument ation, co -ordination o f activities, etc. Secr etarial continuit y may be achieve d through co llabor ation wit h related depart ments, provide d there i s sufficient capacity. 6.4 Advisory Committees A mult i disciplinary advi sory commit tee is des irable, to support the pharm acovigilance cen tre with reg ard to the quality of the proced ures in: data coll ection a nd assessment the i nterpretati on of the data the public ation of inform ation. An advisor y committee may r epresent t he follow ing disciplin es: general medicine pharmaceutics clinical pharmacolog y toxicology epidemio logy pathology drug informa tion phytothera dition network of advi sors in various spec ialisations is helpful. Wh en the centre is located in a hospit al, spec ialised expert ise is usually within easy reach. 6.5 Inform ation servi ce The provis ion of a ation servi ce to healthcare profess ionals is a basic task of a pharmacov igilance cent re and a majo r inst rument in t he stimulation of reporting. For this purpose and for the assessment of case reports the centre should h ave access to a comprehen sive and up- to-date li terature information da tabase (a list of relevant literat ure reference s may be obtained fro m the Uppsala Mon itoring Centre). Locat ion of the cent re in a large hosp ital usually has the advantage o f a library within reach. National pharma covigilance centres ca n ha ve on-l ine access to the da tabase of the UMC and b e on the mailing lists of adverse dru g reaction and drug bulletins p roduced by t he World Health Organ ization and many national or regi onal centres throughout the world (ask the UM C for addre sses or see W HO con tacts on p age 17). 6.6 Comm unications A bul letin or newsl etter distri buted to al l heal thcare profession als or a regular column in reputed (medical and pharmaceutical) journals are good means for the dissemination of inform ation. Prompt dat a-sheet am endments ar e im portant, bu t data-sheet s may be print ed infrequent ly and their educ ational impact may not be large. In urgent cases of s ufficient import ance \"De ar Doc tor\" letters m ay alert the prof ession. 96.7 Pois on control and drug inf ormati ntres Poison cont rol and drug inform ation centres h ave much in common wit h pharmacov igilance centres, bot h in org anisation and from a scient ific po int of view. If pharmacov igilance is started in a country where a po ison control or drug inform ation cent re is already in place it may be efficient to develop the pharmaco vigilanc e system in conj unction with it. Expensive facilities suc h as secretar iat, co mputer reso urces and library se rvices can be sh ared . In any case c lose collaborat ion between these or ganisations is de sirable. 7. ASSESSM ENT OF CASE REPORTS The as sessment of advers e react ion c ase report s needs combine d expert ise in clinical med icine, pharmacology and t oxicology, and epidemiolog y. This expertise can be deve loped by trai ning the centre's staff and by the use of specialised cons ultants. In the ass essment o f case reports the following elements can be recognised: 1. Quality of d ocument ation (e.g. complet eness and integrity of dat a, quality of diagno sis, follow-up). The basic e lements of a case report a re listed in \u00a7 4.1. 2. Codin g. Drug names should be r egistered in a systematic way, for ex ample by usin g the WHO Drug Dictionary (w hich is b ased on the INN n omenclatu re and the ATC classific ation). For the codin g of the adve rse events the WHO Adv erse Reaction Terminolog y (WHOA RT), or anot her internationally recognis ed terminolog y (e.g. MedD RA) should be u sed. 3. Rele vance with rega rd to the detecti on of new rea ctions, drug regulation , or scientific or educ ationa l value. The fo llowing questions especially ma y be asked: New drug? Products on t he market less than five year s are usually conside red new drugs Unkn own reactio n? (i.e. not included in the approved Summary of Product Charact eristics or ' unlabelled' ). Also important is whet her t he re action is describe d in the literature, e.g. n ational dru g form ulary, M artindale, Me yler's Side Effect s of Drugs. (Ask the Uppsa la Mon itoring Cent re for books and other inform ation s ources ) duplicate reports . Certain ch aracteristics of a case (sex, age or date of birth, dates o f drug exposure , etc. ) may be used to ident ify dupl icate reporting. 5. Causality assessment or imputa tion. exc cted adverse dr ug re actions. Vario us approaches have been developed for the structured determinat ion of t he likelihood of a causal relationship bet ween dru g expo sure and adverse events, for example by the WHO Dr ug Mon itoring Prog ramm e (se e Glo ssary), the Euro pean Commission, a nd the French na tional pha rmacovigilance progr amme. These systems ar e largely based on fo ur consid erations: the association in t ime (or place) between dru g adm inistration and event ph armacology (including current knowledge of nature and frequen cy of adverse reaction s) medica l or p harmaco logical plausibility (signs and sympt l aborat ings, mecha nism) likelihood or exclu sion o uses . The WHO c ausality cate gories h ave th e adv antag es of bein g int ernationally agreed and easy to use. Definit ions for selected adver se react ions h ave been worked o ut and re ached by 10 internation al agreem ent. F or some of th ese re actions special c ausality algor ithms have also been devel oped ( B\u00e9nichou, 1 994). 7.1 Data- processing In the early st ages case-r eports can be m anaged manually. When reporting incre ases, a computer system en abling the proce ssing and retrieval of c ases accord ing to suspected drugs and adve rse reaction s is g enerally advisable. The computer system use d should inc lude a hier archical drug file allowing drugs to be recorded according to product name, generic name an d th erapeut ic category. Sim ilarly a hierarchical adverse react ion termino logy should be employ ed. Hierarchic al systems for the recor ding of drug s and adverse re actions are nece ssary to a llow for spec ific recordin ation pe rmitting ret rieval o f inform ation at higher leve ls. As f ar as po ssible int ernational ly recognise d terminologies and classification s of dr ugs (ATC, INN) and adverse re actio ns (e.g. WHO ART, MedD RA) should be used, to fa cilitate interna tiona l comparison s of re sults and int ernational transfer of data. Speci al care sho uld be taken t o attain compat ibility wit h the re porting re quirement s of the WHO Drug Mon itoring P rogramme. Detailed in structions on ho w to organi se comput erise d data for submission to t he WHO d atabase are obta inable from the Uppsal a Moni toring Cent re. It m ay not be cost- effective to desi gn a computer system for the ma nagement of advers e reaction repo rts from scratch. Commer cial programmes are availab le which h ave been ap propriately tested and c an be custo mised accord ing t o local needs includ ing local lang uages. 8. USE O F THE DATA Data collected in ph armacovigilance can be used in a var iety of w ays. 8.1 Hypothe sis generation a nd strengt hening A major aim of pharmacovigila nce is the ea rly detecti on of hypoth eses or signals (see Glossary ) with reg ard to possible adverse react ions. Early signals may be too unce rtain, howev er, to justify firm conclusions and regulatory action, an d may need further study (see \u00a7 8.5). A signal may be strengthened by combin ing the experien ces r eported in various countries. There fore international collaborat ion is import ant. 8.2 Drug regulation After approval of a medicinal product , all available domest ic and internationa l safety information is cont inuously mon itored by t he dr ug regu latory authority and the pharmaceutical com pany concerned. O ften problem s can be solved by adaptation of the approved product in form ation (inclusion of new adverse effe cts, warnin gs, or indication change s). Sometimes stronger restrictive actions are need ed, with with draw al of the marketin g authorisation as the extrem e. For the approva l of a given d rug in a given count ry, it may be very helpfu l to have info rmat ion on the experienc es with the d rug in co untr ies wher e it is already in use ( e.g. through col laboration with the Upp sala Monitoring Centre). 8.3 Inform ation For the disse mination of information of curr ent impo rtance or interest to heal thcare pra ctitioners, an adverse drug reactions bulletin or a column in medical and pharmaceutical journa ls may be very he lpful. In the c ase of an emergenc y, a letter d irectly to all doctors and pharmacists m ay be needed. Usually such act ions t ake p lace in col laboration wit h the regu latory authority and the pharmaceutical com pany' s experts. 118.4 Educ ation a pre- and postg raduate e ducation o f healthcare professionals is an i mportant aspect of pharmacovigilance. Ap propriate educational act ivities will improve knowled ge and aw areness of adverse drug react ions and stimulate reporting. D rug inform ation off icers and loc al or n ational Formular y Committees may bene fit from close collaboration w ith the pharm acovigilanc e centre. 8.5 Limitations regar ding the use of the data Usually case reports of suspected adve rse react ions may be influ enced by all sorts of bias. The interpreta tion of pha rmacovigilance da ta may be difficult. Often signa ls are unsubsta ntiated and require furth er study for c onfirm ation o r refut ation (hypothesis te sting) and fo r the asse ssme nt of the reaction frequency, for example , as needed for d rug reg ulatory decision-m aking. On the one ha nd a pharma covigilance centre ha s the task to stimula te the use of the collected data by heal thcare prof essional s, and on the ot her ha nd to ensure tha t the heterogeneous and largely unpro ven dat a are used in a careful and scientifically (a nd soci ally) responsi ble way. The spont aneous r eporting syst em is especia lly help ful in the detection of adve rse re actions that are speci fic or occur in a s uggestive time-relationship with dr ug use (e.g. anaphylactic shoc k), but may be less effect ive in studying other s orts of adver se reactions (e.g. cancer development ). The potenti al of the sponta neous reporti ng system to determin e the true frequency of ad verse reactions is limited. The detailed reporting o f historie s of pat ients with iatrogenic injur y and the sub sequent use o f the reports are to a va riable extent sub ject to rules regarding privacy and medic al secrecy. Confidentiality of pe rson al data is need ed. The complex o f details in a patient history m ay be as persona l as a finger print and therefore a potential identifier. It is adv isable for a pharmacovigilance s, identifying legi data- user an d de scribin g whic h data eleme nts are available to who m and fo r which p urpose and which use s are excluded. Confidentiality prim arily concerns the secr ecy of the identity o f all indiv iduals (patient, repor ter, doct or) and institutions (hospit al) involved. In many countries case report summ aries are not c onsider ed co nfident ial. Besides legal obl igations, the commi tment of hea practitioners and pa tients together to make inform ation available. If pharmacovigilance data were used against the wish of reporters, the system as a who le might collapse. 9. RELATIONS WITH OTHER PARTI ES 9.1 The Dr ug Re gulatory Authority The Drug Regula tory Authority in the country needs to be i nformed a bout suspected adverse reaction s wit hout delay, especially wh en unusua l (e.g. re actions not include d in t he app roved Summary o f Product Char acteristics) or serio us. In addition, a pharmacovigilance cent re sh ould inform the regula tory authority about a ny cluster of case reports that is of po ssible intere st, or when an adv erse r eaction is reported in high or 9.2 Pharmaceu tical compan ies Pharm aceutical compan ies need t he same inform ation as the regulatory authority. It will dep end on t he loc al situation wh ether compa nies are to be info rmed direct ly or v ia the regulatory authority. 12 9.3 Professi onal m edical and pharmaceut ical associations A ph armacov igilan ce centre sho uld seek the support of professional me dical and pharmace utical associations . In the case of an emer genc y, these assoc iation s should be in forme d in good tim e. 9.4 World H ealth Orga nization an d WH O Coll abor ating C entre f or International Dr ug Monitoring A new pharmacovigilanc e centre shoul d make cont act with the World Health Or ganization in Geneva and the WHO Collab orating Centre f or Intern ation al Drug Mon itoring (the UMC ) in Uppsal a, Sweden. 9.5 National pharmacovi gilance centres In addition it may be helpful to make contacts with nationa l pharm acovigilance centre s in nearby co untries. When more exper ienced, such centr es may be h elpful with staff trainin g. 9.6 Academi a The need for pharmacovigilance and the nature of its proced ures ar e a n atural part of the curric ulum of pre-graduate training. In add ition a p harmacovigilance cent re may cont ribute to and p articipate in post graduate educational pro grams . Findings or h ypotheses from the pharmacovigilance system ma y be of potential interest for further stud y with reg ard to mechani sms, reaction fre quenc y, and so on, to aca demic pharmacolog ical orga nisation Support from national asso ciation s of co nsumers and patients ma y add to the general acceptance of pharm acovigilance. G ood rel ations with leading journa lists may be help ful, e.g. for g enera l public relations and as part of the risk mana geme nt strategy whe never an acute drug problem arises. Special attention may be needed to explain to journalists t he limit ations of pharmacovigilance da ta (see \u00a7 8.5) 10. OTHER SOURCES OF I NFORMATI ON Spont aneou s Report ing is especi ally useful in pic king up signals of re latively rare, serious and unexpected adverse reactions. For less rare adverse reactions seve ral other met hods m ay be used , e.g. c linical trials or cohort studies. In a ddition to spont aneous reporting sever al other met hods have become available to provide data relevant to pha rmacovigilance. Ex ample s are: Prescription Event Moni toring, C ase-Control Survei llance ipurpose datab ases. In add ition, dru g utilisation data is of v alue in safety assessment. 11. FUNDING An esti mation of the amount of money needed for pharmacovigilance can be calculated as a function of the ra te of rep orting requi red and the size of the population (see \u00a7 5.3 and 6.1). The collect ion of quantitatively and qualitatively good data and the careful assessment and distribution o f such inform ation obvio usly have a pric e. A pharm acovigilance centre shou ld have some b asic, regular source of funding in order to ensure cont inuity in its wo rk. Such fundin g may be obtained as part of the drug registration fee, or through a special mandatory pharmacov igilance contribution. Bo th can be inc luded in the budget of th e drug regulatory authority. 13Apart from t he basic r esources, the cen tre may tr y to get addit ional fundin g from var ious parties with an interest in ph armacovigi lance. Institutions that may be approached include: healt h insurance com panies and an interest in drug safety . In view o f the gre at commercial and public he alth conse quences of adve rse re action s, the cont inuit y of the fund ing of pharm acovigilance should be guar anteed and no t be susceptible to possible pressure groups , polit ical chan ges or econo mic factors.

GLOSSARY A drug or medic ine is 'a pharmaceutical product, used in or on the human body for the prevention, d iagno sis or treatment of disease, o r for the modi fication of phy siological funct ion'. An unexpecte d adverse re action is 'an adverse re action, the nature or sever ity of which is not consist ent with domest ic labellin g or market authorisation, or expe cted from characteristics of the drug'. Here the predomin ant elem ent is that the phenomenon is unknown. 14 A side effect is 'any unint ended e ffect of a pharmaceutical product occurrin g at dose s nor mally used in man, which is re lated to the pharmacolo gical propriet ies o f the drug'. Es sential elements in this defi nition are the pha rmacological nature of the effect, that the phenome non is uninte nded, and th at there is no overt overdose. An adver se reactio n is 'a response to a medicine w hich is nox ious and un intended, and whic h occurs at dos es norma lly used in man'. In this desc ription it is of i mportance t hat it concerns the response of a patient, in which individu al factors may play an import ant role, and that the phenomenon is nox ious (an unexpected therape utic response, for example , may be a sid e effect but not an adverse re action). A signal refe rs to 'reported inform ation on a possi ble causal re lationsh ip between an adverse event and a drug , the re lationsh ip being unknow n or incompl etely doc umented previou sly'. Usually mor e than a sin gle report is requir ed to gener ate a signal, d epending upon the serio usness of the event and the quality of the inform ation. In these definitions drug or drug food interactio ns are also included. It should be adde d that many p atient s have only suspected adverse re actions in wh ich the cau sal role of the dr ug is unproven and may be doubtful , and that pharmaco vigilance data usually refer to only suspected adverse reactions an d side effect s. An adverse e vent or experience is defined as 'any untoward medical occurrence that may present duri ng trea tment wi th a medi cine but not necessa rily ha ve a causal rela tionshi p with this trea tment'. The ba sic point here is the coi ncidence i n time without a ny suspi cion of a causa l relationsh ip. Serio us adver se events can be de fined a s those t hat: a. are life threatening or fatal b. cause or prolong hospit al admission c. cause per sistent incap acity or disability; or d. concern misuse or dependence. Type A effect s ('drug actions') are t hose which are due to (exagge rated) pharm acological effects. Type A effects tend to be fairly common, dose related (i.e. more frequent or severe with higher doses) and m ay often be avoided by using doses wh ich are ap propriate to the individ ual pat ient. Such effects can usually be reproduc ed and studied experimentally and a re often alr eady identified before mar keting. Interact ions between drugs, espec ially pharm acokinetic inter actions, m ay often be c lassified as Type A e ffects, although t hey are re stricted to a defined sub- population of patients (i.e. the users of the i nteracting drug) . Type B effec ts ('patient rea ctions') cha racteristically occur i n onl y a minority of patients and displ ay little or no dose relationship . They are generally rare and unpre dictable, and m ay be serious and notori ously difficult to stu dy. Type B immu nological or occ ur often unkno wn - predi sposing ditions. rashe s, anaphyl axis, vasculitis, inflammat ory or gan injury autoimmune syndromes. Also non- immu nologic al Typ e B effect s occur in a minorit y of pred ispos ed, int olerant, pat ients, e.g. because of an inborn error of metabo lism or acquired de ficienc y in a cert ain en zyme, res ulting in an ab norm al m etabolic p athway or 15accum ulation of Type C effect s refer to situations wher e the use of a drug , often for unknown reason s, incre ases the fre quenc y of a 'spontaneous' d isease. Type C effects m ay be both serious and common (a nd include m alignant tumo urs) and may have prono unced effects on public hea lth. Type C effects may be coin cidental and often conc ern lon g term effects; ther e is o ften n o sugge stive time relationshi p and the connecti on ma y be very di fficult to prove. Conf identi ality: Maintenance of the p of patients, thcare provi ders and institutes, includin g per sonal identities and all per sonal med ical info rmat ion. Verification : The proced ures carried out in pharmaco vigilanc e to ensure that the d ata contained in a final report mat ches the or iginal observ ations. Thes e proc edure s may apply to medical records, d ata in c ase-repo rt forms (in hard cop y or electron ic form), comp uter printouts, and statistical ana lyses and tables. Valid ation: The action o f proving that any procedur e, process, e quipment (inc luding the so ftware or hardw are used ), material, activity or syst em used in p harmacovigilance act ually leads t o the expected results. CAUSALITY CATEGORI ES The ca usality categories describ ed by the Up psala Monitoring C entre are as follows: 1. Certain : a clinical event, incl uding labora tory te st abnormality, o ccurrin g in a plausib le time rela tionshi p to drug administration, and which cannot be ex plain ed by c oncurrent disease or oth er dru gs or chemicals. The respon se to withdra wal of the drug (decha llenge) shoul d be clinically plausible . The event must b e definitive pharmaco logically or phenomenolo gically, using a satisfactory recha llenge procedure if necessary. 2. Probable/Likely : a clinical event , including labor atory test abnorm ality, w ith a reason able time seq uence to administration of the drug , unlikely to be attributed t o concurrent disease or ot her drugs or chemicals, and whic h fol lows a cl inically Rech allenge info rmat ion is not required t o fulfil this defin ition. 3. Possible : a clinical ev ent, includ ing laboratory test abnorm ality, with a re asonable time sequence to admi nistrations of the drug, but which could also be ex plained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. Informat ion on drug w ithdrawal may be lacking o r uncle ar. 4. Unlike ly: a clin ical even t, includin g labor abnorm ality, wit h a t emporal relationsh ip to drug adm inistration which m akes a causal relationship improb able, and in which other dru gs, chem icals or underlying disease provide pl ausible Condit event , inc luding laborat ory t est abnormal ity, reported as an a dverse r eaction, about which m ore dat a is essent ial for a p roper assessment, or the additional data is under exam ination. 6. Unassessable /Unclassifiable : a report sugge sting an adverse re action which c annot be judged bec ause inform ation is insufficient or contradict ory, and which cannot be supplemente d or ver ified. As a step towards harmo nisation in drug re gulation in the countries o f the European Un ion, the EU pha rmaco vigilance wor king p arties proposed t he follow ing three causality categories : 16 Categ ory A : 'Report s incl udin g good reason s and sufficient document ation to assume a causal relationship, in the sense o f plausible , conceiv able, likely, b ut not ation to a ccept the possibilit y of a causal relationsh ip, in the sense of not impossible and no t unlike ly, although t he connect ion is uncert ain and may be eve n doubt ful, e.g. bec ause of miss ing d ata, insufficient evidence or the possibility of another explana tion'. Categ ory O : 'Reports w here c ausalit y is, for one or another reason , not assessable, e.g. because o f missin g or con flicting data' .
