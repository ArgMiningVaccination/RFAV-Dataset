While approximately 80% of cases lead to mild symptoms, there can be life-threatening cases, especially among older adults and those who have serious chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease. The virus is likely spread through airborne droplets released when an infected person breaths, talks, coughs, or sneezes, by close contact with an infected individual, or by touching a surface contaminated with the virus and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes. Symptoms According to the Centers For Disease Control (CDC), symptoms of the virus most commonly include fever with dry cough, shortness of breath, and pneumonia. Other symptoms reported include tiredness, headache, runny nose, sore throat, loss of sense of smell or taste, diarrhea, and body aches. Some people may have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all but may still be contagious. Prevention There are currently vaccines available to protect against this new virus. Federal, state, and local health departments recommend these simple steps to help stop the spread of COVID-19: - Get vaccinated - Wear a mask that covers your mouth and nose - Stay home whenever possible. - Practice social distancing - stay at least six feet from others and avoid large groups. - If you must go out, wear a mask to cover your mouth and nose. - Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. - Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. - Avoid close contact with anyone from outside your household - Avoid close contact with people who are sick. - Stay home when you are sick and keep your children home if they are sick. - Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing. If you use a tissue, throw it in the trash. - Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces, such as toys, door handles, cellphones, and countertops. Additionally, if you or a family member begin showing symptoms of a respiratory illness and suspect it may be COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider before going there and inform them that a case of COVID-19 is suspected, then follow their advice.
