Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda are considered as two of the most ancient systems of medicine, with history of further than two millennia. Medicinal plants are the top medicinal accoutrements used in both these systems. Methods: A bibliographic disquisition of Chinese and Indian pharmacopoeias, studies and sanctioned websites was performed. Likewise, information was attained from scientific databases on ethnobotany and ethno drugs. Results: The review of Ayurveda and TCM ethno drug indicates that both these systems have numerous medicinal accoutrements in common. The studies carried out by the authors for comparison of shops from same rubric from both these TSM's have been bandied to further bring focus to the operation of \" qualitatively \" similar species which can be employed and substituted for risked or economically valued species. The overview of ancient literature and scientific findings for drugs in both these systems suggests that, the botanical drugs used in common and their processing styles can be explored further for extensive application in traditional drug. Conclusion: This review describes the histories, common medicinal plant species, their processing styles and remedial operations in Ayurveda and TCM. The perceptivity handed through this composition may be used by herbal drug researchers and pharmacists for further exploration of botanical drugs from these two traditional systems of medicine. Introduction Plant based drugs have been used for millennia in different traditional systems of medicine (TSM) for promoting health and wellbeing. Along with the rapid-fire- fire development of disquisition on medicinal plants, the international demand for plant resources have significantly increased due to their increased application. The germplasm resources of multitudinous shops have been risked due to the damage and degeneration of the ecological system [1-3]. The agricultural product and force of multitudinous species has gradually dropped. Studies of medicinal shops to identify plant species with similar phytochemical constituents or with similar content of active constituents will help in relating species which can be \"qualitatively\" and \"quantitatively\" substituted. Analogous studies encyclopaedically will facilitate the protection and sustainable utilization of medicinal plant coffers which have been considerably exploited due to high marketable demand [4]. WHO describes traditional medicine as \" the sum total of the knowledge, chops, and practices grounded on the propositions, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether soluble or not, used in the conservation of health as well as in the prevention, opinion, improvement or treatment of physical and internal illness \"( WHO/ EDM/ TRM/2000.1). Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) are considered as two of the most ancient systems of drug, each with histories stretching over several millenia. Ayurveda and TCM have been discussed and compared by numerous scholars in numerous reviews [5-7]. They both have long, but different histories in the operation of medicinal shops for remedial treatments. There are several botanical drugs that are used in common between these two TSM's for either analogous or different remedial operations and which are formulated by employing different processing methods. In the present review, we have made an attempt to put forth information for understanding the systems of medicine of Ayurveda and TCM, their histories and the botanical drugs used in common between these systems. The processing strategies used for the botanical *Corresponding author: Melanie Houghton, Department of traditional medicine, Jodrell M (2022) Role of Herbal drugs in Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine .

Section snippets Resources of medicinal materials used in China and India In China, precious experience has been accumulated from traditional medicine practices in different regions. Medicinal plants and their reused products are considerably used in clinical operations under the guidance of TCM proposition. The Chinese Pharmacopoeia records an aggregate of 644 species of medicinal plants. The recently published Zhong Hua Ben Cao records 8980 Chinese medicinal materials including 7815 herbal substances. So far, this monograph Books and ancient compilations of medicinal materials The major classics in TCM include, The Divine Husbandman's Classic of Materia Medica, Collection of narrative on the Classic of Medica) lately Revised Materia Medica , Materia Charaka Samhita, Sushruta Samhita and Ashtanga Hridaya the major classic book contributions in Ayurveda including recentCitation: Houghton M (2022) Role of Herbal drugs in Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine . J Tradit Med Clin Natur, 11: 335.Page 2 of Issue 7 1000335 J Tradit Med Clin Natur, an open access journal Similarities and differences of medicinal materials related to sources and usages The two TSMS, Ayurveda and TCM share several plant species in common used for remedial treatments and they share a common ideal of enhancing the wellbeing of individualities through use of natural medicinal accoutrements with a holistic approach [9-10]. These systems share similar philosophical approach in treatment of diseased conditions considering the mortal body constituents and elements of universe. Human body is considered as the core and the universe's five elements (water, metal, earth, wood) Experimental evidences to explore common plant species in Ayurveda and TCM The authors have carried out tissue-specific metabolite analysis grounded relative studies of plant species set up in common between Ayurveda and TCM. Metabolite lives of shaft- deconstructed Aconitum carmichaelii and Aconitum kusnezoffii were studied. The presence of the \" high acute poisonous \" class of Diester Diterpene Alkaloids( DDA) spectrometry( UHPLC - QTOF MS) based analysis. Processing methods Some plants, animal- based products and minerals in their natural form are not suitable to be used directly as drugs and should be vanquished to processes likepre-treatment, detoxification and expression, as necessary previous to administration. The processing methods include cleaning, slice, stir- frying, scorching, storming, boiling, calcining, etc. In TCM, the points of processing are to enhance the efficacity and/ or reduce the poison and to change the conduct or properties of crude drugs. Current status Worldwide, pharmaceutical exploration is increasingly focusing on the traditional medicinal materials of TCM and Ayurveda as these are two of the oldest and comprehensive medical systems known. In the once twenty times, modernization of these systems has made huge leaps, incompletely due to the adding worldwide interest in their uses and properties, and partly due to the advances in affiliated technological fields. Conclusion In the present review, the histories of Ayurveda and TCM, and the common plants species used in their practice have been discussed. The perspective of feting common plant species between these two TSMs, the similarities and differences in their processing styles and their remedial operations can help herbal drug researchers and traditional medicine practioners to explore further avenues in plant grounded drugs.
